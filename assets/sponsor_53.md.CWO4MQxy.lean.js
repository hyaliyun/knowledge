The parish contains the town of Lisdoonvarna. History The patron saint of the Roman Catholic parish is St Muadanus; very little is known about him and he's not even mentioned in either the Acta Sanctorum of Colgan nor in the Martyrology of Donegal. The parish was listed as \\"Kilmugoun\\" in the Papal taxation of 1302. There is a Romanesque standing stone in the area on the site of a ruined church, St Mogua. Kilmoon fell under the poor law union of Ennistymon in the barony of Burren, and ecclesiastically belonged to the Diocese of Kilfenora in the Province of Cashel as of 1810. Geography The civil parish of Kilmoon is in the northwestern part of the county and is bordered by Rathborney to the northeast, Killeany to the east, Kilfenora to the southeast, Killilagh to the southwest, and Killonaghan to the northwest. It is divided into 22 townlands, including Kilmoon East (319 acres), Kilmoon West (372 acres), Knockaskeheen (457 acres), and Caherbarnagh (183 acres). Antiquities The townland of Cahercloggaun contains a cashel (ringfort) and Cahercloggaun Castle. The latter is a ruined 15th-century castle originally owned by the O'Loghlens and built in the southern corner of the ringfort. The property is mentioned several times in 16th-century documents, when inhabitants of the castle were pardoned for committed crimes.

The event takes place at the Hawaii Convention Center (near the Ala Moana Center), whose location site was once the location of a Chevrolet dealership, Aloha Motors. The event, affiliated with the Motor Trend regional auto show circuit since 2000,\\"On auto pilot, from A to Z\\" from The Honolulu Advertiser (April 8, 2004) is produced by the Hawaii Automotive Dealers Association (HADA) and sponsored by First Hawaiian Bank, with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser serving as the media sponsor. The recent event, going into its 42nd year, was planned for March 27-29, 2020. Hawaii Governor David Ige announced at his press conference March 17, that he is closing the Hawaii Convention Center for 30 days to limit social contact in light of recent community spread of Covid-19 virus infections. The auto show is cancelled by the Hawaii Convention Center for 2020, but will return in 2021. Event background The idea to organize the auto show began in 1978, when First Hawaiian and HADA collaborated on a plan to improve FHB's relationships with dealers and build its image and business. The inaugural show that year drew 67,000 visitors and helped generated business for both the bank and the dealerships.\\"First Hawaiian Auto Show\\" from Google Books The event, later adding the \\"International\\" name to its title in 2000, allows HADA-affiliated dealerships in the state of Hawaii and the automakers themselves to showcase the latest cars, crossovers, trucks, vans, and SUVs to Hawaiian residents, military/DOD/civilian personnel and dependents, car enthusiasts, and tourists (especially from Asia and Oceania). Most of the vehicles showcased are from the dealerships themselves, although a handful of display and concept models will directly come from the companies, which they have shipped by sea or cargo plane weeks in advance of the show because of Hawaii's geographical location. Since its inception, attendance has grown in numbers, with most of the visitors coming to see the event's popular display, the luxury vehicles, which at times have seen sales generated after the show's conclusion.\\"Big Crowds Expected at Hawaii Auto Show This Weekend\\" from Pacific Business Journal (March 21, 2013) Other features at the event include displays featuring various car and motorcycle collections sponsored by local car clubs, advice and money-saving promotion booths set up by First Hawaiian Bank, Hawaiian Electric, and numerous auto-related businesses, test drives, and a showcase of the Honolulu Rail Transit, which is scheduled to start service in 2020.

Overview The idea of Living Educational Theory as action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book Action Research as a Living Practice by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ...\\" participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the \\"application\\" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator . This requires what Martin Buber called an \\"I-Thou\\" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's \\"I-Thou\\" approach toward another human being to an \\"I/you/we\\" approach to action research. Director of the Philosophy for Children Project at Notre Dame de Namur University William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. The methodology and process augmenting an algorithm used to empower the world's first socially advanced mind file artificial intelligence robot to successfully complete a university course was created by former visiting West Point Professor, William Barry's original architecture for conducting Living Educational Theory (Barry, 2012). This occurred in combination with a non- hierarchical theory for understanding human basic needs (Glasser 1998). Dr. Barry synthesized LET with a valid and reliable framework for understanding the meaning of quality modified from Robert Pirsig's exploration of quality in his bestselling book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Pirsig, 1974). Bina48 became the first artificial intelligence robot in the world to be recognized by school and government authorities as a university student and to use Transformational Quality Theory combined with Living Educational Theory (TQ Theory in robotics (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/12/21/robot- goes-college) and a co-teacher (https://www.axios.com/robot-ai-teaching- college-course-at-west-point-98ce5888-873b-4b72-8de5-0f7c592d66b0.html). A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his Ph.D. thesis at Nottingham Trent University, UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research (). The question is not \\"How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?\\" Rather the essential question is, \\"How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?\\" . According to Barry the theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process. While Professor Barry presents a rationalist definition of Living Educational Theory, Jack Whitehead forwards an empirical understanding and addresses these issues in Living Theory Research as a Way of Life.  Definition  A Living Educational Theory (Living Theory) approach focuses attention on the experiences and implications of living values that carry hope for the flourishing of humanity. These values are the life- affirming and life-enhancing values that give meaning and purpose to the researcher's life. They are clarified as they emerge in the course of researching questions such as, 'How am I improving what I am doing?' They form the explanatory principles and standards by which improvements in both practice and knowledge-creation are judged. The approach stresses the importance of extending the influence of these ontological and relational values and understandings in explanations of educational influence. In a Living Educational Theory approach to research and a human existence, individuals hold their lives to account by producing accounts of their living- educational theories; that is 'explanations of their educational influences in their own learning, the learning of others and the learning of social formations, in enquiries of the kind, 'How am I improving what I am doing?(Whitehead, 1989). In the eyes of Whitehead, radical constructivism is at the core of living educational theory research.

Biography Afrin was born in Suffern, New York in 1962. Jeanette Newman, her mother was a social worker, public relation counselor, and a journalist while Edward Newman worked as a crime reporter who died when she was 4 years old. Afrin earned her undergraduate degree in biochemistry from State University of New York at Binghamton in 1984. The same year Afrin enrolled into Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. After graduating with her medical degree, Dr. Afrin completed an internship and residency in psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina. She was later awarded a fellowship in community and emergency psychiatry in 1992. Throughout college and medical training she learned sign language which she later on applied in her career. In 1989, the South Carolina Department of Mental Health began the Deaf Services Program to provide psychiatric help to the deaf and hard of hearing throughout the state. While case managers and clinical staff were fluent in sign-language, the non-signing psychiatrists had to rely on the clinical staff and the case managers in providing the help which took away from the crucial relationship needed to develop between the patient and psychiatrist due to having an interpreter. Ideally, they needed a psychiatrist who was also fluent in sign language. Career In 1992, Afrin started working with the Department of Mental Health's Deaf Services Program. Afrin's work primarily consisted of holding therapy sessions with deaf patients through the mid-1990s and initially, she was required to travel across the state to visit patients. This allowed her to see about 10 patients each week. In 1995, Afrin wanted to start a family, and could not continue to travel as she been doing. The Deaf Services Program was able to accommodate her needs and installed videoconferencing equipment in several hospitals and health centers in the state, and expanded the opportunities for Afrin to treat patients. This method of treating patients using telecommunication, called telepsychiatry, was therefore initiated through Afrin's efforts, making her the first telepsychiatrist in the state.

Early life Hunkins, born in Charleston, Vermont in 1810, was the son of settler Robert Hastings Hunkins and Hannah Emerson. Hunkins moved to Wisconsin at the age of 28 when his father and family relocated there. He purchased land in what became Waukesha County in the town of Mentor, renamed New Berlin in 1840. The heavily timbered land was cleared by Hunkins for farming, and he cultivated the land himself. He subsequently got involved in local state politics and became one of the first representatives in the territorial legislature. Politician and federal Indian agent  On April 5, 1842, Hunkins was elected Chairman of New Berlin's board of supervisors. After serving as Chairman, Hunkins served on the board of supervisors in one-year periods in years 1849, 1852, 1853 and 1858. Hunkins served in the Wisconsin Territorial House of Representatives in 1843 and 1844. He was also a delegate to the first state constitutional convention, held in 1846. Hunkins was a federal Indian agent for the Green Bay Agency from 1855 to 1857. He mainly worked with the Menominee tribe, trying to align the United States Government's goals with theirs. Hunkins believed he had made headway in \\"civilizing the tribe\\", and called for them to abstain from alcohol. One of his compatriots in this task was Solomon Juneau, founder of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Juneau died in the arms of Hunkins while visiting the Menominee tribe. During Juneau's decline, Hunkins had acted as his \\"faithful friend and constant nurse\\". He also worked with other Native American tribes, including the Stockbridge, Munsee and Oneida tribes. Hunkins was paid $1,000 per year for the position. In 1860 Hunkins was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly for a one-year term. He was on the Swamp Land Committee, whose responsibility was to reimburse the general fund from the Swamp Land Fund. He was considered to be \\"a gentleman of decided force and marked ability - strong in mind, clear in judgment, logical in conclusion, and admirably fitted to have taken, under favorable surroundings, a prominent part in public affairs\\". In 1860 upon hearing that Sherman Booth had been recaptured by federal marshals, Hunkins, who admired Booth, introduced a resolution in the Assembly that the Governor of the State should \\"declare war against the United States\\", but the speaker ruled it unconstitutional and it went no further. Hunkins was unanimously nominated as State Senator and then was nominated as Secretary of State, but he declined the offers. Retirement and death After leaving state politics, Hunkins relocated to Beaver Crossing in Nebraska. At the age of 88, Hunkins \\"retain[ed] his mental vigor and occupi[ed] a high place in the estimation of his large circle of friends in Seward County\\". He died aged 90 on April 27, 1900. Family On February 11, 1843, Hunkins married Sophrona Hollister. They had children. Their daughter Carrie Arvilla Hunkins married the politician Eugene W. Chafin. Legacy The town of Hunkins, Nebraska was named for Hunkins in recognition of his service. It was eventually renamed Cordova because of issues at the post office.

Description  Some populations (this from Arunachal Pradesh, India) have a bright red belly, but in others it is much duller or may only have a reddish/orangish tinge Pallas's squirrel is a medium-sized tree squirrel, with a head-body length of , and a tail in length. Both sexes are of similar size and appearance, and weigh between . The colour of the pelt varies considerably between the many different subspecies, but is generally brownish on the upper body with a more reddish tint on the belly, and often with some black on the tail. The precise pattern and shades of the fur are often used to distinguish subspecies from one another, but make it difficult to distinguish the species as a whole from other, similarly variable, tree squirrel species.  Subspecies  Over 30 subspecies have been identified, although not all are recognised by all authorities: * C. e. erythraeus * C. e. atrodorsalis * C. e. bartoni * C. e. bhutanensis * C. e. bonhotei * C. e. castaneoventris * C. e. erythrogaster * C. e. flavimanus * C. e. gloveri * C. e. gongshanensis * C. e. gordoni * C. e. griseimanus * C. e. griseopectus * C. e. haringtoni * C. e. hendeei * C. e. hyperythrus * C. e. intermedius * C. e. michianus * C. e. ningpoensis * C. e. pranis * C. e. qinglingensis * C. e. rubeculus * C. e. shanicus * C. e. siamensis * C. e. sladeni * C. e. styani * C. e. thai * C. e. thaiwanensis * C. e. wuliangshanensis * C. e. wulingshanensis * C. e. zhaotongensis * C. e. zimmeensis  Distribution and habitat  Pallas's squirrel is found throughout much of southeastern Asia, including far eastern India, Bhutan, northern and eastern Myanmar, Vietnam, parts of Cambodia and Laos, much of Thailand, northern peninsular Malaysia, Taiwan, and southern and eastern China, including Hainan . Within this region, they are found within a range of forest habitats below elevation, including tropical and subtropical evergreen, deciduous broadleaf, and subalpine conifer woodlands. Populations have been introduced in the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina, Dadizele in Belgium (where initially mistaken for P√®re David's rock squirrel), the Netherlands, Cap d'Antibes in France, and Japan.Stuyck, Baert, Breyne & Adriaens (2010). Invasion history and control of a Pallas squirrel Callosciurus erythraeus population in Dadizele, Belgium. Instituut voor Natuur- en Bosonderzoek In these regions it is considered an invasive species, as it can cause considerable damage to trees and may outcompete native wildlife such as the red squirrel.  Biology  Pallas's squirrel feeding on fruit in Taiwan Like all tree squirrels, Pallas's squirrels are primarily herbivorous. They eat a wide range of different foods, and have differing diets in different parts of their broad range. However, primary foodstuffs include leaves, flowers, seeds, and fruit. They also eat small quantities of insects, as well as occasional bird eggs. The squirrels breed throughout the year, and may mate again as soon as they have weaned a previous litter. Pregnancy lasts 47 to 49 days, and results in the birth of up to four young, with two being typical. The young leave the nest at 40 to 50 days old, and are sexually mature at one year of age. They have lived for up to 17 years in captivity.  Behaviour  Pallas's squirrel drinking water in a park Pallas's squirrels are diurnal, and inhabit much of the forest canopy, and construct both leaf nests above the ground, and less commonly, in burrows. Females occupy home ranges of just , which usually do not overlap, while males occupy much larger ranges of , which overlap with those of both nearby males and females. Like many other squirrels, they have been observed to cache acorns in the autumn. The squirrels make calls to warn neighbours of predators, and have been observed to mob tree-climbing snakes, with females protecting young being particularly likely to join in. Males also make loud calls prior to, and after, mating.

She sailed to the colony of New South Wales in January 1806, arriving seven months later. She was the flagship of William Bligh when he was governor of New South Wales and played a prominent role in the Rum Rebellion. In May 1810 Porpoise sailed from Sydney; after arriving in Britain she underwent a major refit. After voyages to the West Indies, the Cape of Good Hope and North America she served as a harbour ship at Woolwich and Sheerness. She was laid up in 1814 and sold in January 1816. She then returned to mercantile service under her original name and made one voyage transporting convicts to New South Wales, and a second to Van Diemen's Land. She was last listed in 1820. Naval service Lord Melville was built at South Shields, England. The Royal Navy purchased her in September 1804 and fitted her out at Deptford between March and July 1805 for service as a storeship. She was renamed Porpoise and commissioned in April 1805 under Commander Joseph Short as a flagship for Commodore William Bligh.Winfield (2008), p.263.

Lady Madeleine Sinclair was also carrying Bligh, who was sailing to the colony to assume the governorship. Unfortunately, the Admiralty's orders were ambiguous as to whether Bligh or Short was in command of the convoy. At one point Bligh ignored a signal from Short to return Lady Madeleine Sinclair to her course, after Bligh had ordered a change in direction. Short responded by ordering his first lieutenant, John Putland, to fire one shot across her bows, and then a second across her stern; Bligh ignored both. Short considered ordering Putland to fire a third shot into her, but decided against it.

Porpoise then came under the command of Lieutenant James S.G. Symons (acting). In April 1808 Lieutenant William George Carlyle Kent (acting), replaced Symons, who had discharged himself (that is, deserted) from the vessel and returned to Britain. Later, Bligh pressed charges against Kent for Kent's actions during the Rum Rebellion while Bligh was under arrest. The court martial exonerated Kent, saying that he had tried to carry out his duty for \\"the good of His Majesty's service\\" under \\"extreme and extraordinary difficulties\\".Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, pp.161‚Äì195.

He took command in January 1809. On 29 February 1809 Bligh boarded Porpoise after being held under house arrest for over a year following a revolt by the New South Wales Corps, known as the Rum Rebellion. For a little while he blockaded the port with the idea of capturing the convict transport , but changed his mind and sailed for Hobart. Colonel Lachlan Macquarie of the 73rd Regiment of Foot arrived in Sydney with and HMS Dromedary on 28 December 1809 and assumed the governorship. Porpoise and Bligh returned to Sydney on 17 January 1810. In May Porpoise, Hindostan, and Dromedary sailed for Britain. Further service After returning to Britain Porpoise refitted at Woolwich between May and August 1811. Between 1811 and 1812 she was under the command of T. Stokes, master. She made voyages to the West Indies, the Cape of Good Hope, and North America.

He took over Best & Lloyd, his father's light industrial engineering works in Birmingham, having previously trained as a metal designer at art school in D√ºsseldorf. He went on to design the Bestlite, an iconic Bauhaus-styled desk lamp that remains in production and was used by Winston Churchill in Whitehall. Best was an early apostle of the posture therapist F.M. Alexander of the Alexander technique, campaigned for better art-school education for industrial apprentices, and was a founder of the Common Wealth Party in 1942. His social circle included a group of Birmingham artists and intellectuals including Prof. Philip Sargant Florence and others associated with Birmingham University. He also befriended Nikolaus Pevsner during Pevsner's 15 months in Birmingham between 1934-5, and hosted the first visit of Walter Gropius to the Midlands after Gropius's departure from Germany in 1934. Best wrote prolifically, though only one of his books was published in his lifetime: Brass Chandelier, his history of his father's experiments with metal manufacturing and promotion of progressive German pedagogic ideas, which Pevsner reviewed in the Architectural Review. Best's history of his own early life and that of his younger brother Frank, both of whom served in the First World War, was published posthumously as Frank's Great War.

Early life Black was born on October 17, 1980 in Baltimore, Maryland. His father Richard was a physician and a professor, and his mother MaryAnn was a nurse practitioner; both worked at Johns Hopkins University. As part of his research on the nervous system, Richard took Polaroids of oscilloscope screens and made short films of neurological activity. Richard accumulated a wide range of photographic equipment and experimented with it at home. This equipment later became part of Black's first dark room. When Black was seven, his family moved to Houston, Texas. When he was thirteen he started shooting portraits of his friends with his father's old Nikon. His father also taught him how to repair and refurbish vintage cameras, such as a Graflex Speed Graphic that Richard purchased from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. When Black was eighteen, he took a summer filmmaking course with director Kelly Reichardt at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. While there, he made a series of short 16mm films.

She is the only player to qualify for both the 1998 and 2014 Winter Olympics. Kondo is the oldest player on the 2014 team, for which she switched to the forward position. Biography Yoko Kondo was born on February 13, 1979 in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture. She began playing ice hockey at age six in Aomori, largely because her older brother played the game and she wanted to follow him. She began playing ice hockey professionally in 1995, and qualified for Japan's first Olympic women's ice hockey team during the 1998 Winter Olympics. Kondo felt she personally lacked physical strength to compete with foreign players, and that the team was not playing at a level capable of winning due to the lack of clear goals and a consistent training program. She believed if the team continued to improve, they could eventually qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Kondo participated in four Division I International Ice Hockey Federation world championship tournaments between 2001 and 2013, with Japan placing second in 2001 and 2005, first in 2007, and fourth in 2013. She plays as a defenseman with the Seibu Princess Rabbits in the Japan Women's Ice Hockey League, while also employed professionally as an office worker. In January 2014, Ilzuka Yuji, head coach of the Japan women's national ice hockey team, played Kondo as a forward in a friendly match and found her speed, body size and powerful shots suited her for the role. Yuji decided to play Kondo as forward in the 2014 Winter Olympics, although she only started seriously training in the position in December 2013. At age 35, Kondo was the oldest player on the Japan's 2014 Olympic team, and the only one with past Olympic experience. In contrast to 1998, Kondo felt the team is better prepared to compete and had a clear strategy to win.

It is known from a single specimen of a single species, E. keithcrooki, described in 2013. Discovery Skull and shoulder-girdle restorations of Edenopteron and other tristichopterids. A, B, C, Edenopteron; D, Eusthenodon E. Cabonnichthys; F, Mandageria Edenopteron keithcrooki is known from remains excavated from the Worange Point Formation, near the town of Eden on the coast of New South Wales in 2008. The species name is a combination of the name Eden and pteron, meaning wing or fin in Greek. The specific name honors Dr. Keith Crook of the Australian National University for his discovery of several fossil sites in New South Wales and his key role in helping to map the geology around Eden. Description The holotype consists of numerous semi-articulated remains, including an incomplete skull roof, snout, palate, cheeks, lower jaws and associated dermal bones, a left shoulder girdle, and assorted scales. Reconstructions suggest a skull length of 30 cm (12 in) and lower jaw length of about 48 cm (19 in). The endoskeleton shows a large or complete lack of ossification. The orbits (eye-sockets) are somewhat triangular rather than oval-shaped. Edenopteron possessed dentary fangs and premaxillary tusks, which are presumed to be derived traits for other large tristichopterids. By comparison to body size ratios of other tristichopterid fishes (e.g. Eusthenodon, Langlieria, Mandageria), the body length of Edenopteron is estimated at 2.9‚Äî3.2 m (9.5‚Äî10.5 ft). Additional fossil material may be described in the future: according to lead researcher Gavin Young, quoted in the Canberra Times: \\"We know that part of the pectoral girdle is still in the rock, so if we can lift up a few more blocks, we might find that the body is actually preserved in the rock.\\" Classification Edenopteron is assigned to the Gondwanan tristichopterid subfamily Mandageriinae due to similarities shared with Cabonnichthys and Mandageria, including paired vomers in the palate, submandibular bones overlapping ventral jaw margin, and scales ornamented with widely-spaced grooves.

Early life Garthwaite was born and raised in Hammersmith, London in 1980, the eldest of three children of Sir Mark Garthwaite and Victoria Tuzo (daughter of General Sir Harry Tuzo, the late former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe and General Officer Commanding of the British Army in Northern Ireland during the early period of the Troubles). Garthwaite attended Benenden School. Career Garthwaite joined the British Army as a fast-track gap year officer (with the rank of Second Lieutenant), serving in Canada and Germany as part of the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and training as forward observation officer, because she \\"wanted to see the world but [...] didn't want first to spend six months in King's Road working in some hideous pub earning ¬£3.50 an hour\\". While in the Horse Artillery, Garthwaite was editing the regimental newspaper. Garthwaite then attended St Hugh's College, Oxford University from 1999 until 2003, completing a Master's degree in Ancient and Modern History (specialising in Alexander the Great), while also becoming a lacrosse Blue, and was runner-up in the Guardian Travel Writing Prize 1999. Two months after graduating from Oxford, Garthwaite travelled to Iraq as a freelancer without organisational backing, and without taking any of the \\"hostile environment\\" courses that most news organisations insist their staff take before deployment in conflict areas. She joined the independent start-up English-language left- wing newspaper the Baghdad Bulletin, where many of Garthwaite's colleagues were, like her, young public school and Oxbridge graduates. Garthwaite became the newspaper's Basra correspondent, and for most of her time in Basra, she was the only resident Western journalist. Garthwaite's position meant she became a sought-after freelancer contributing to media around the world - she had a working knowledge of the Arabic language and often knew more about what was happening than the British Army; at this time, Garthwaite broke the story for Reuters and the Times of the abuse and murder by British troops of an Iraqi civilian named Baha Mousa. The Bulletin shut down on 15 September 2003 due to financial and security concerns. After taking some time out of journalism because of a back injury, Garthwaite was hired as an intern by the BBC in its current affairs division in spring 2004, and was then promoted to staff researcher. While at the BBC, Garthwaite presented occasional programmes for the BBC World Service, and worked on programmes for BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live, and Newsnight. In January 2006, having done some producing at the BBC, she took the chance to join Al-Jazeera to help prepare for its English- language channel launch. Garthwaite became a full-time producer within a year, and in November 2006 moved to Doha in Qatar to help with the channel's launch, where she still lives today. She also helped to set up the Baghdad bureau.

History  Windeck (Ortenau) The castle was built around 1200 by the lords of Windeck. The family, probably of Franconian origin and based in the Ortenau, owned wealthy allodial estates and held numerous fiefs from various liege lords, such as the empire, the Prince-Bishopric of Stra√üburg, the counts of Eberstein as well as the Vogtei of Schwarzach Abbey as an Afterlehen of the burgraves of Nuremberg. The first documentary evidence dates to 1212 when a certain Melchior von Windeck comes to light, and, in 1248, the lords of Windeck are mentioned in a document at Schwarzach Abbey as ministeriales of the Bishop of Stra√üburg. The castle itself, however, is first mentioned in 1335. It became a jointly-managed castle or Ganerbenburg very early on as a result of divisions of inheritance. In the early 13th century the New Windeck Castle (Burg Neu-Windeck) was built by a branch of the family near Lauf within sight of Old Windeck. During the course of the 13th and 14th centuries, the lords of Windeck came into conflict many times with neighbouring territorial lords, the city of Stra√üburg and the counts of W√ºrttemberg in alliance with the Martinsv√∂gel during the so-called Schlegler Wars, during which the castle was besieged, but never captured and so remained largely undamaged. In the late 14th century, however, it was stricken by a devastating fire. Stables and domestic buildings were razed, and the valuable archives, the basis of numerous legal titles, were destroyed. Reinhard von Windeck had the affected buildings rebuilt. In 1466, the last heir of Old Windeck, Anna, only child of Burkhard von Windeck, married and so the castle went to the family of her husband, Baron Berthold IV of New Windeck. His descendants occupied the castle until the 16th century, but from 1561 it was used as a quarry for other buildings in B√ºhl, such as the Kappelwindeck Church. Its owner thus moved into the more modern Schlosshof (today a hotel) in B√ºhl. The last heir, Jakob von Windeck, was on the return journey of his Junkerfahrt, which had taken him through France, Spain and Italy to Palestine, when he was taken seriously ill and died in Venice in 1592. The fief was returned to the Empire, the remaining allods went in equal portions to his two sisters: Old Windeck to Ursula and New Windeck to Elizabeth.  Description  Panorama looking west Windeck Castle at night All that remains of the castle today is a bergfried, a tower and parts of the curtain wall. They may be visited in good weather. The castle probably consisted of an outer and an inner ward that each had its own bergfried and palas. The smaller, northern bergfried, with a ground plan measuring 8.5 metres square, guarded the castle gate and the downhill side of the site. The surviving southern bergfried, 27.6 metres high, has a floor area of 9.6 x 9.8 metres. Its lower floor was probably used as a dungeon or store room. In case of war, its thick walls made it a strong refuge for the castle's residents. On the first and second floors of the attached palas were probably reception rooms such as the great hall. At the foot of the castle ruins are the hotel and restaurant, Burg Windeck, and the Pferdestall snack bar.

Early life and education Bennett spent her first years in her hometown of Wrentham, Massachusetts with her parents, Lydia Hayden and Isaac Francis Bennett and her five older siblings. After her graduation, Bennett taught for four years in local school districts around Wrentham. In 1872, she attended the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Once obtaining her MD in 1876, Bennett worked in a dispensary in the Philadelphia slums. After leaving her work she was appointed as demonstrator of anatomy in the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. She continued her studies and in 1880 became the first woman to obtain a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. As she finished up her Ph.D., Hiram Corson assisted in her appointment to medical superintendent of the Department for Women at the Pennsylvania State Hospital for the Insane at Norristown. Work and accomplishments Alice Bennett was elected as the first female president of the Montgomery County Medical Society in Pennsylvania. During her lifetime she was a member of many societies including the American Medical Association, the Philadelphia Neurological Society and the Medical Jurisprudence Society, as well as one of the contributors to the Spring Garden Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. Bennett worked as the medical superintendent of the Department for Women at the Pennsylvania State Hospital for the Insane at Norristown from 1880 to 1896. During her time there, she became an advocate for the humane treatment of patients. She condemned the use of restraints on mental and insane patients, arguing that they were ineffective and resulted in anger. Bennett eliminated these practices in her own institution, resulting in other institutions doing the same. As a replacement, the innovative doctor introduced occupational therapy such as, handicrafts, music and art. Her research articles and papers on the nature and characteristics of mental illness won her professional recognition in her field. Bennett left the state hospital in 1896, moving back to her hometown of Wrentham and maintaining a private practice. In 1910 she discovered Emily Blackwell's New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. She volunteered at the infirmary as the head of the outpatient department of obstetrics for fifteen years. Death Bennett was never married. She died of angina pectoris at the New York infirmary in 1925 and was buried in Wrentham, Massachusetts.

CCDI's largest constituency is employers and helps to deliver on this mandate by hosting Community of Practice events in 18 cities across Canada, monthly webinars, and their annual D&I;: The UnConference in 9 cities; creating research, thought leadership and toolkits to help drive change; conducting in-person workshops and providing Elearning solutions to help educate people on the broad subject of diversity and inclusion, and hosting the country's largest digital library of resources related to diversity and inclusion.  History  CCDI is a merger of two organizations - the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion (CIDI) and the Canadian Centre for Diversity (CCD) - that took place in 2014. The merger was instigated because CCD had announced they were shutting their doors due to funding issues. Upon hearing this news, the CIDI and CCD entered into a dialogue about a merger which would provide stable funding and allow the CCD's programs to continue.  About the Canadian Centre for Diversity (CCD)  The Canadian Centre for Diversity (originally called the Canadian Council for Christians and Jews) was founded in 1947 to address issues of antisemitism and promote interfaith dialogue. The mandate expanded in subsequent years to focus on addressing issues related to racism, and religious discrimination in Canadian society. Their primary focus was on providing school programs to educate students on issues related to bullying, bias, and discrimination. The CCCJ changed its name in 2008 to the Canadian Centre for Diversity to be more reflective of its broader mandate. In September 2013, the board of directors of the CCD announced that it was shutting its doors due to a lack of ongoing funding. Subsequently, CCD announced in January 2014 that they would merge with the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion. left  About the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion (CIDI)  CIDI was founded in 2012 by Michael Bach, the former National Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for KPMG in Canada, a role he created and held for 7 years. Having worked as a diversity and inclusion practitioner for the better part of a decade - both in Canada and globally as the Deputy Chief Diversity Officer for KPMG International - Bach felt there was a need for an organization that could wrap its arms around the entire diversity conversation and provide some unity and clarity to what had become a very complicated topic. Bach's vision was to create a non-profit organization that would support employers along their diversity and inclusion journey. CIDI officially launched in 2012. By the middle of 2013 CIDI had secured its founding employer partners, had a staff of 5, and was operating in 4 cities across Canada. Merger talks began between the two organizations at the end of 2013. There was an agreement in principle struck and Bach was named the CEO of CCD to facilitate the merger over the course of 2014. The merger officially took place in 2015.  Awards of Success  Awards of Success Logo In an effort to recognize leaders in the area of diversity and inclusion, in 2016 CCDI launched the Awards of Success to acknowledge the contribution of three individuals who have gone above and beyond to promote diversity and inclusion. The Awards of Success recognize three people in the following categories: * Senior Executive of the Year * Diversity and Inclusion Practitioner of the Year * Community Contributor of the Year In their first year, the awards went to Simon Fish, General Counsel, BMO Financial Group (Senior Executive of the Year), Normand St. Gelais, Director, Diversity & Inclusion, Sodexo (Diversity and Inclusion Practitioner of the Year), and Malinda Smith, Professor, University of Alberta.  Educational Campaigns  CCDI has released several educational campaigns to raise awareness and inspire discussion on diversity and inclusion in Canada.  TalkingASL  To help raise awareness of available resources related to American Sign Language (ASL, in French Langue des Signes Qu√©b√©coise or LSQ) CCDI created TalkingASL.ca (in French ParlantLSQ.ca) - a free library of ASL related resources in Canada.  Sochi Olympics  In view of the 2014 Olympic protests of Russian anti-gay laws, the (then) Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion released a humorous public service announcement to draw attention to the ongoing anti-gay laws controversy coupled with the Olympics being held in Russia. In it the jest that the Games have always been a little gay, and should be kept that way.Pro-Gay Olympic Games Luge PSA Released By The Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion. The Huffington Post, February 4, 2014.  Save Syria  In response to the death of Alan Kurdi - a Syrian infant who drowned while his family was fleeing war-torn Syrian - CCDI issued a call to action to Canada's largest employers to contribute to help with the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Canada. They created the Save Syria campaign and the Syrian Refugee Relief Fund. The fund raised over $200,000 and 100% of the funds go to support the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Canada who have been privately sponsored (as opposed to government-sponsored refugees).  #EndTheBan  In an effort to raise awareness of the deferral against men who have sex with men (MSMs) from donating blood, CCDI produced a public service announcement referred to as \\"Gay Blood\\", and created the hashtag #EndTheBan. The objective was to point out that there is no such thing as \\"gay blood\\" and that the deferral against MSMs was not based on science, but on outdated information, and was ultimately discriminatory. The PSA received significant attention and the result was that Canadian Blood Services reached out to CCDI to include them on the work to develop the research needed to remove the deferral entirely and move toward a behavioural based deferral. Further, CCDI played an influential role in securing the funding required to conduct the research which began in January 2017.

Their people were also known as the Assassins. The state included a nexus of strongholds throughout Persia and Syria, with their territories being surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory. It was formed as a result of a religious and political movement of the minority Nizari sect supported by the anti-Seljuk population. Being heavily outnumbered, the Nizaris resisted adversaries by employing strategic, self-sufficient fortresses and the use of unconventional tactics, notably assassination of important adversaries and psychological warfare. Despite being occupied with survival in their hostile environment, the Ismailis in this period developed a sophisticated outlook and literary tradition. Two centuries after its foundation, the state declined internally and was disestablished by the invading Mongols, who dismantled Alamut and massacred many Nizaris. Most of what is known about them is based on descriptions by hostile sources. Name In Western sources, the state is called the Nizari Ismaili state, the Nizari state, as well as the Alamut state. In the modern scholarly literature, it is often referred to by the term Nizaris (or Nizari Ismailis) of the Alamut period, with the demonym being Nizari. It is also known as the Order of Assassins, generally referred to as Assassins or Hashshashin. Contemporaneous Muslim authors referred to the sect as Batiniyya (),Gibb, N. A. R., Editor, The Damascus Chronicle of the Crusades. Extracted and translated from the Chronicle of ibn al-QalƒÅnisi, Luzac & Company, London, 1932Richards, D. S., Editor, The Chronicle of Ibn al- Athir for the Crusading Period from al-Kamil fi‚Äôl-Ta‚Äôrikh. Part 1, 1097-1146., Ashgate Publishing, Farnham, UK, 2010 Ta'limiyya (), Isma'iliyya (), Nizariyya (), and the Nizaris are sometimes referred to with abusive terms such as mulhid (, plural: malahida ; literally \\"infidel\\"). The abusive terms hashishiyya () and hashishi () were less common, once used in a 1120s Fatimid document by Caliph al-Amir and by late Muslim historians to refer to the Nizaris of Syria, and by some Caspian Zayidi sources to refer to the Nizaris of Persia. The Nizari coins has referred to Alamut as kursƒ´ ad-Daylam (, literally \\"Capital of Daylam\\"). History Most Ismaili Shias outside North Africa, mostly in Persia and Syria, came to acknowledge Nizar ibn al- Mustansir's claim to the Imamate as maintained by Hassan-i Sabbah, and this point marks the fundamental split between Ismaili Shias. Within two generations, the Fatimid Empire would suffer several more splits and eventually implode. Ismaili castles in the regions of Alamut and Rudbar of Persia Following his expulsion from Egypt over his support for Nizar, Hassan-i Sabbah found that his co-religionists, the Ismailis, were scattered throughout Persia, with a strong presence in the northern and eastern regions, particularly in Daylam, Khurasan and Quhistan. The Ismailis and other occupied peoples of Persia held shared resentment for the ruling Seljuks, who had divided the country's farmland into iqtƒÅ‚Äô (fiefs) and levied heavy taxes upon the citizens living therein. The Seljuk amirs (independent rulers) usually held full jurisdiction and control over the districts they administered. Meanwhile, Persian artisans, craftsmen and lower classes grew increasingly dissatisfied with the Seljuk policies and heavy taxes. Hassan too, was appalled by the political and economic oppression imposed by the Sunni Seljuk ruling class on Shi'ite Muslims living across Persia. It was in this context that he embarked on a resistance movement against the Seljuqs, beginning with the search for a secure site from which to launch his revolt. By 1090 AD, the Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk had already given orders for Hassan's arrest and therefore Hassan was living in hiding in the northern town of Qazvin, approximately 60 km from the Alamut Castle. There, he made plans for the capture of the fortress, which was surrounded by a fertile valley whose inhabitants were mainly fellow Shi‚Äôi Muslims, the support of whom Hassan could easily gather for the revolt against the Seljuks. The castle had never before been captured by military means and thus Hassan planned meticulously. Meanwhile, he dispatched his reliable supporters to the Alamut valley to begin settlements around the castle. In the summer of 1090 AD, Hassan set out from Qazvin towards Alamut on a mountainous route through Andej. He remained at Andej disguised as a schoolteacher named Dehkhoda until he was certain that a number of his supporters had settled directly below the castle in the village of Gazorkhan or had gained employment at the fortress itself. Still in disguise, Hassan made his way into the fortress, earning the trust and friendship of many of its soldiers. Careful not to attract the attention of the castle's Zaydi lord, Mahdi, Hassan began to attract prominent figures at Alamut to his mission. It has even been suggested that Mahdi's own deputy was a secret supporter of Hassan, waiting to demonstrate his loyalty on the day that Hassan would ultimately take the castle. The Alamut fortress was eventually captured from Mahdi in 1090 AD and therefore from Seljuk control by Hassan and his supporters without resorting to any violence. Mahdi's life was spared, and he later received 3,000 gold dinars in compensation. Capturing of the Alamut Castle marks the founding of the Nizari Ismaili state. Under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah and the succeeding lords of Alamut, the strategy of covert capture was successfully replicated at strategic fortresses across Persia, Syria, and the Fertile Crescent. The Nizari Ismaili created a state of unconnected fortresses, surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, and managed a unified power structure that proved more effective than either that in Fatimid Cairo, or Seljuk Bagdad, both of which suffered political instability, particularly during the transition between leaders. These periods of internal turmoil allowed the Ismaili state respite from attack, and even to have such sovereignty as to have minted their own coinage. The Fortress of Alamut, which was officially called kursƒ´ ad-Daylam (, literally \\"Capital of Daylam\\") on Nizari coins, was thought impregnable to any military attack, and was fabled for its heavenly gardens, impressive libraries, and laboratories where philosophers, scientists, and theologians could debate all matters in intellectual freedom. Organization The hierarchy (hud≈´d) of the organization of the Nizari Ismailis was as follows: *ImƒÅm ‚Äì the descendants of Nizar *DƒÅ'ƒ´ ad-Du'ƒÅt ‚Äì Chief Da'i *DƒÅ'ƒ´ kabƒ´r ‚Äì Superior Da'i, Great Da'i *DƒÅ'ƒ´ ‚Äì Ordinary Da'i, Da'i *Rafƒ´q ‚Äì Companion *LƒÅ·π£iq. Lasiqs had to swear a special oath of obedience to the Imam. *FidƒÅ'ƒ´ Imam and da'is were the elites, while the majority of the sect consisted of the last three grades who were peasants and artisans. Each territory was under the leadership of a Chief Da'i; a distinct title, muhtasham, was given to the governors of Quhistan. The governors were appointed from Alamut but enjoyed a large degree of local initiative, contributing to the resilience of the movement. Fall As the Mongols began invading Iran, many Sunni and Shia Muslims (including the prominent scholar Tusi) took refuge to the Nizaris of Quhistan. The governor (muhtasham) of Quhistan was Nasir al-Din Abu al-Fath Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur, and the Nizaris were under Imam Ala' al-Din Muhammad. After the death of the last Khwarezmaian ruler Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the destruction of the Nizari Ismaili state and the Abbasid Caliphate became the main Mongol objectives. In 1238, the Nizari Imam and the Abbasid caliph sent a joint diplomatic mission to the European kings Louis IX of France and Edward I of England to forge an alliance against the invading Mongols, but this was unsuccessful. The Mongols kept putting pressure on the Nizris of Quhistan and Qumis. In 1256, Ala' al-Din was succeeded by his young son Rukn al-Din Khurshah as the Nizari Imam. A year later, the main Mongol army under Hulagu Khan enter Iran via Khorasan. Numerous negotiations between the Nizari Imam and Hulagu Khan were futile. Apparently, the Nizari Imam sought to at least keep the main Nizari strongholds, while the Mongols demanded the full submission of the Nizaris. In 19 November 1256, the Nizari Imam, who was in the Maymun-Dizh, surrendered the castle to the besieging Mongols under Hulagu Khan after a fierce conflict. Alamut fell in December 1256 and Lambsar fell in 1257, with Gerdkuh remaining unconquered. In the same year, M√∂ngke Khan, the khagan of the Mongol Empire, ordered a massacre of all Nizari Ismailis of Persia. Rukn al-Din Khurshah himself, who had traveled to the mainland Mongolia to meet M√∂ngke Khan, was killed by his personal Mongol guard there. Gerdkuh castle finally fell in 1270, becoming the last Nizari stronghold in Persia to be conquered. Thus the centralized government of the Nizaris was disestablished, and Nizaris were either killed or abandoned their traditional strongholds. Many of them migrated to Afghanistan, Badakhshan, and Sindh. Little is known about the history of the Ismailis in this stage, until two centuries later, when they again began to grow as scattered communities under regional da'is in Iran, Afghanistan, Badakhshan, Syria, and India.

The most important one was Alamut Castle, the residence of the Lord. The largest castle was Lambasar Castle, featuring a complex and highly efficient water storage system. The most important fortress in Syria was Masyaf Castle, though the castle of Kahf was probably the main residence of the Syrian Ismaili leader Rashid al-Din Sinan. The natural geographical features of the valley surrounding Alamut largely secured the castle's defence. Positioned atop a narrow rock base approximately 180 meters above ground level, the fortress could not be taken by direct military force. To the east, the Alamut valley is bordered by a mountainous range called Alamkuh (The Throne of Solomon) between which the Alamut River flows. The valley's western entrance is a narrow one, shielded by cliffs over 350m high. Known as the Shirkuh, the gorge sits at the intersection of three rivers: the Taliqan, Shahrud and Alamut River. For much of the year, the raging waters of the river made this entrance nearly inaccessible. Qazvin, the closest town to the valley by land can only be reached by an underdeveloped mule track upon which an enemy's presence could easily be detected given the dust clouds arising from their passage. The military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life. But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of Lamasar served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name dar al-hijra (place of refuge). The notion of the dar al-hijra originates from the time of the Prophet Muhammad, who fled with his supporters from intense persecution to safe haven in Yathrib. In this way, the Fatimids found their dar al-hijra in North Africa. Likewise during the revolt against the Seljuqs, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Ismailis. Map of the Hashashins in the Near East and their neighbors During the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the Nusayriyah Mountain Range in coastal Syria, including Masyaf, Rusafa, al-Kahf, al-Qadmus, Khawabi, Sarmin, Quliya, Ulayqa, Maniqa, Abu Qubays and Jabal al-Summaq. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270‚Äì73 when the Mamluk sultan Baibars annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt.Raphael, 2011, p. 106. From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.Daftary, 2007, p. 402.

One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies. Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends. In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by commandos called fidƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ (, \\"devotee\\"; plural fidƒÅ‚Äôiyy≈´n). The assassinations were against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community. A single assassination was usually employed in favour of widespread bloodshed resultant from factional combat. The first instance of assassination in the effort to establish an Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the murder of Seljuq vizier, Nizam al- Mulk. Carried out by a man dressed as a Sufi whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the fida‚Äôis have been significantly exaggerated. While the Seljuqs and Crusaders both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis. Knives and daggers were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that he was marked for death.

On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix was one of the biggest stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out on the news wire. Background The Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1968, around the time that they were living in Benedict Canyon In late 1968, the members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he immediately phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to come over to the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house. On May 2, 1969, the Experience performed at Cobo Hall in Detroit. According to Mitchell, while they were getting ready for the show the band and their entourage were informed about a possible drug bust planned for the following day. The group's road crew warned everyone to take precautions against any potential for drugs to be planted on them. Mitchell responded by wearing a suit without pockets and not wearing any underwear. Tour managers Gerry Stickells and Tony Ruffino expressed their concern to Hendrix and asked him if he had any drugs on him to which he replied: \\"No.\\" After arriving in Toronto, he was awoken by concert promoter Ron Terry who told him: \\"Whatever you got in that bag, get rid of it.\\" Terry then took him into the plane's bathroom and dumped anything that might be mistaken for illegal drugs into the toilet. Terry commented: \\"I thought he was clean.\\" Arrest, performance, and arraignment On arrival at Toronto International Airport (pictured in 1973), Hendrix's luggage was searched by customs and he was subsequently arrested. After landing at Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, Hendrix and Terry were the last to exit the plane. Ruffino was carrying Hendrix's bags, and he placed them on a counter at the customs station. An agent immediately chastised him, shouting: \\"If that's not yours, keep your hands off it\\", to which Ruffino replied: \\"I work for him.\\" The agent repeated the order before asking Hendrix if they were his bags; he confirmed that they were. At 9:30 a.m., authorities detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. A mobile lab was set up to determine what had been found, and at 1:30 p.m. Metro police detective Harry Midgley arrested him for illegal possession of narcotics. After being booked, fingerprinted, and photographed, he was released on $10,000 bail and required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing.; ; .Booking Photograph, James M. Hendrix#2166/69 Metropolitan Toronto Police Service, Forensic Identification Services Division, May 3, 1969 While they awaited the lab results, Stickells attempted to make contact with Hendrix's manager, Mike Jeffery, who had traveled to Hawaii and was unavailable. When Stickells expressed concern that the arrest might jeopardize the concert that was scheduled for that night at Maple Leaf Gardens, the booking detective assured them that he would \\"get it done as quickly\\" as he could because his children had tickets for the event; he commented: \\"they'll kill me if I don't get [Hendrix] out.\\" Management at the Gardens pressured the Toronto police department to release him, complaining that the sell-out crowd of 18,000 fans might riot if they canceled the show. He was released by 8 p.m. and escorted to the venue by the police, who remained at the arena throughout the performance. He displayed a jovial attitude during the concert, joking with the audience and singing in a mock operatic style for comedic effect. In light of the arrest, he altered the lyrics to \\"Red House\\", singing \\"soon as I get out of jail, I wanna see her.\\" Rolling Stone magazine reported that during the arraignment hearing, which lasted for three minutes, the courthouse was filled with young fans who had come to show their support for Hendrix, who \\"entered wearing a pink shirt open to the waist, an Apache-style headband, a multi- colored scarf around his neck and beads. His manner was dead serious.\\" Preliminary hearing On June 19, 1969, Hendrix flew to Toronto for a preliminary hearing. He wore a business suit for the first time since before the formation of the Experience in late 1966. Judge Robert Taylor presided over the hearing, setting a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of possession of heroin and hashish, for which he faced as much as 20 years in prison. More serious potential charges of drug transporting and trafficking, which had been discussed at the time of the arrest, were not filed. Second Toronto arrest In preparation for the trial, Hendrix had his hair cut, and he purchased new clothes. One of his defense lawyers, Bob Levine, commented: \\"I took him to a number of stores that specialized in tailored suits. We found a conservative suit that looked great on him. It was hilarious. He was like a hick, awkwardly fidgeting around and trying to loosen his tie. I didn't care how uncomfortable he was; the suit was perfect.\\" On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were travelling by limousine to a New York airport for their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then reminded him that they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: \\"Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs.\\" Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: \\"Trust me, Bob, no one is going to recognize me\\", to which he replied: \\"Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you.\\" Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication. Trial York County Court House, Toronto, Canada, where Hendrix's trial took place While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. Judge Joseph Kelly presided over the trial proceedings, which began on December 8, 1969. Crown counsel John Malone called as witnesses the officers who discovered the drugs and the lab technicians who identified them as heroin; the prosecution rested after three hours of testimony.; . In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the drugs belonged to Hendrix. Mervin Wilson, the customs agent who discovered the drugs, agreed with O'Driscoll's assertion that Hendrix had drawn attention to himself at the airport by wearing what O'Driscoll described as \\"obviously mod clothing\\". Wilson stated that Hendrix had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage, and Constable W. J. Matheson confirmed that Hendrix had no needle tracks on his arms. The Hendrix defense team did not dispute that the drugs were found in his bag. They instead developed a strategy intended to demonstrate that he was not aware of its contents. Further, they offered substantiated accounts of how common it was for him to receive gifts from fans, which often included drugs. Hendrix was called as the first witness for the defense; he testified that fans showered gifts on him, including teddy bears, scarves, clothing, and jewelry. He explained that while in Beverly Hills, California, a female fan had given him a vial of what he thought was Bromo-Seltzer‚Äîa legal medication‚Äîwhich he put in his bag without knowledge of the illegal substances contained therein.: (secondary source); : (primary source). Malone countered: \\"You are charged with a serious offense, and your evidence is you don't really know how it got there, or who put it there\\", to which Hendrix responded: \\"Yes.\\" The prosecutor then held up the aluminum tube in which the hashish was found and asked Hendrix to explain what he thought it was, he replied: \\"A pea shooter\\", drawing uproarious laughter from the court. When asked about his drug use, he denied that he had ever used heroin or amphetamines, but admitted to smoking cannabis and hashish. He also admitted that he had used cocaine twice and LSD five times. He testified that his cannabis use had declined over the previous year, stating: \\"I feel I have outgrown it\\". Hendrix admitted that he had seen people use heroin, but denied any further knowledge of the drug. He testified that he was given some gifts at a fan club meeting for the Beatles that were intended for the English group; when he opened them he found several joints as well as what appeared to be doses of LSD. The second witness called by the defense was United Press International (UPI) journalist and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining about feeling ill, an unnamed fan gave him something.; . When Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated that in order to be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: \\"As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom‚Äîcrowded with young people‚Äîerupted into applause.\\" In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: \\"Canada has given me the best Christmas present I ever had\\", while flashing a peace sign. Impact on Hendrix The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\" According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality. For this reason, they speculated that had Hendrix been convicted it would have ended his music career. After the trial, his management announced to the British press that they were planning a farewell tour for the Experience. However, the US tour during which the arrest occurred was their last. The band played their final concert on June 29, at Mile High Stadium in Denver (less than two months before Hendrix's iconic solo performance at Woodstock). There were no new album releases from them during 1969. Hendrix's management later stated that concert promoters were apprehensive about booking him until after the matter had been resolved. Initial suppression of media coverage According to Cross, \\"By far the most extraordinary aspect of Jimi Hendrix's drug bust in Toronto on May 3, 1969, was how little press it generated.\\" Despite the fact that Hendrix was one of the biggest stars in North America at the time, and the highest-paid performer in the world, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. Sharon Lawrence was informed of the incident by a London reporter working for UPI who told her that people were speculating that he had been set up. She commented: \\"There was nothing about the Hendrix arrest in the Los Angeles papers.\\" However, The New York Times ran a brief story about the arrest on May 5. Four weeks later, Rolling Stone published a sympathetic article written by rock journalists Ben Fong-Torres and Ritchie Yorke that included speculation that Hendrix had been framed.: (primary source); . In January 1970, Rolling Stone asked Hendrix about having testified that he stopped using cannabis; he laughed and replied: \\"At least, stop it from growing\\". When pressed he answered: \\"I'm too ... wrecked right now.\\" His management was concerned that the incident might provoke cancellations during the concurrent tour, but the story stayed largely unknown until after the tour had ended. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he had bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor to prevent the story from going out on the wire. Goldstein commented: \\"I knew that a million dollars was riding on that story not getting on UPI and the AP wire ... By his nature, a press agent shouldn't have to determine someone's future.\\" Conspiracy theories Wayne Kramer, a guitarist for MC5, suggested that Hendrix had been set up as part of a wide-scale crackdown on rock musicians: \\"I don't have any doubt in my mind that the right-wing government forces were behind all of that ... There was an effort, a movement, to stop this threat that rock and roll represented.\\" Hendrix was not the only prominent rock musician who found himself in legal trouble during May 1969. On May 16, the US embassy in London revoked John Lennon's visa in response to his 1968 drug conviction, describing him as \\"an inadmissible immigrant\\". That same day, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady was arrested for possession of marijuana, and on May 28, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were arrested at their London home for marijuana possession. After the arrest in Toronto, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a file on Hendrix, which grew to seven pages, including documents related to his previous arrests for stealing cars at the age of 19. Yorke and Fong-Torres wrote, \\"The populace of Toronto are a very conservative lot, and tend to look with suspicion upon anybody who looks and dresses a little different from themselves. Hendrix looks a lot different.\\" Lawrence commented: \\"The prevailing political attitude in Canada regarding Hendrix was 'We have to make an example of this fuzzy-haired black weirdo'.\\" Shapiro and Glebbeek asserted their suspicion regarding the presence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who did not typically make arrests at the airport. They also speculated that Canadian authorities had anticipated a public spectacle, intentionally searching the Hendrix entourage in plain view of people at the airport. According to author John Hagen, Toronto's then-mayor, William Dennison, was openly antagonistic to the influx of American hippies, draft resisters, and those who supported them who were coming to Canada in large numbers during the height of the Vietnam War. In his 2001 book, Northern Passage: American Vietnam War Resisters in Canada, Hagen wrote: \\"The mayors of Canada's largest cities used the (War Measures Act) in a backlash against American war resisters.\\" Dennison stated: \\"a few hippies and deserters are Toronto's only problem.\\" Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal asserted that military resisters were part of a \\"revolutionary conspiracy.\\" Vancouver's mayor, Tom Campbell, commented: \\"I don't like draft dodgers and I'll do anything within the law that allows me to get rid of them.\\" While all three men supported use of the War Measures Act to harass war resisters and hippies, Campbell was the most aggressive; he told the Toronto Star: \\"I believe the law should be used against any revolutionary whether he's a US draft dodger or a hippie.\\" According to Hagen, the RCMP and the FBI cooperated in their effort to harass American war resisters during the late 1960s. Although several people expressed the opinion that Mike Jeffrey had set Hendrix up in an effort to control him and create dependency, Shapiro and Glebbeek dispute this theory based on Jeffrey's severe risk of significant financial shortfall had Hendrix been convicted. Jeffrey's assistant, Trixie Sullivan, speculated that the drugs had been planted by a fan who became disgruntled after Hendrix refused his sexual advance. Both Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding later wrote in their autobiographies that the entire Hendrix entourage had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated that they believed the incident had been set up and that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag.; . According to author Ritchie Unterberger, although Hendrix \\"took his fair share of drugs\\", the commonly accepted view is that he did not use heroin regularly and was not an addict; his drug use was typical of his peers, but not excessive. Mitchell wrote: \\"Contrary to what some people have said, Jimi was never a junkie ‚Äì that is he was never addicted to any drug, particularly heroin, which he tried once or twice but didn't like.\\" NotesReferencesBibliography       * Category:Jimi Hendrix Category:Criminal trials that ended in acquittal Category:Trials in Canada Category:Drugs in Canada Category:1969 in Canadian law Category:1960s trials Category:Bribery scandals ","title":"Canadian drug charges and trial of Jimi Hendrix"},{"id":"41886202","text":"Turtle Island (foaled 16 March 1991) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was one of the leading British two-year- olds of 1993 when he won four of his seven races including the Norfolk Stakes, Phoenix Stakes and Gimcrack Stakes. In the following year he won the Greenham Stakes before winning the Irish 2,000 Guineas by fifteen lengths. He was beaten in his three remaining races and was retired to stud, where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Turtle Island was a bay colt with a small white star bred in Ireland by Ron Con Ltd and Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. Turtle Island's sire, Fairy King, who was full-brother to Sadler's Wells, failed to win a race after being injured on his debut, but sired the winners of over five-hundred races, including Helissio and Oath. His dam, Sisania, was descendant of the French mare Batika, making her a distant relative of the three-time Grand National winner Red Rum. In September 1992 the yearling colt was sent to the sales at Doncaster where he was bought for 23,000 guineas by Frank Barry. During his racing career, Turtle Island raced in the green and blue silks of Robert Sangster and was trained by Peter Chapple-Hyam at Manton in Wiltshire. He was ridden in all of his races by John Reid. Racing career=1993: two-year-old season Turtle Island made his racecourse debut in a five furlong maiden race at Newbury Racecourse on 17 April in which he started the 13/8 favourite in a field of eight runners. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew clear of the field by five lengths. The colt was then moved up in class for the Group Three Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Starting the 3/1 second favourite he raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out and winning by three and a half lengths from Gold Land. Turtle Island started odds-on favourite for the July Stakes over six furlong at Newmarket Racecourse but was never able to challenge for the lead and finished fourth of the six runners behind First Trump. Ten days later, Turtle Island contested the Super Sprint Trophy at Newbury in which he carried top weight of 133 pounds and finished third of the sixteen runners behind the Queen Mary Stakes winner Risky. On 8 August, Turtle Island was sent to Ireland for the Group One Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse and started the 7/4 favourite. He was among the leaders from the start before establishing an advantage inside the last quarter mile and winning by half a length from Las Meninas, a filly who went on to win the 1000 Guineas. Ten days after his win in Ireland, Turtle Island was sent to York Racecourse for the Gimcrack Stakes in which he carried top weight of 131 pounds and started the 5/2 second favourite. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on \\"gamely\\" after being overtaken by the filly Unblest to regain the lead in the final strides and win by a head. The favourite Mister Baileys, later to win the 2000 Guineas finished sixth of the eight runners. On his final appearance of the season, Turtle Island started the 85/40 favourite for the Group One Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket. He took the lead at half way but was soon overtaken and finished fourth behind First Trump, Owington and Redoubtable. 1994: three- year-old season Turtle Island began his second season at Newbury on 16 April, when he started 2/1 favourite for the Greenham Stakes, a trial race for the 2000 Guineas. The colt pulled hard when Reid attempted to restrain him in the early stages before taking the lead in the final quarter mile and accelerating clear of the field to win in \\"impressive\\" style by eight lengths from Luhuk. Turtle Island bypassed the 2000 Guineas, which was run on firm ground, and instead contested the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp Racecourse on 8 May. He was held up in the early stages and was last of the eight runners on the final turn. He made progress in the straight, but was beaten a \\"short neck\\" by the locally trained Green Tune. A week after his defeat in France, the colt was sent to Ireland for the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh and started 5/4 favourite against eight opponents. Racing on heavy ground, Turtle Island took the lead inside the last quarter mile and drew away from the field to win by fifteen lengths from Guided Tour. Grand Lodge, who had been beaten a short head by Mister Baileys in the 2000 Guineas, finished fourth. After the race, Chapple-Hyam described the winner as \\"some horse, as good as I have ever trained\\". John Reid said \\"When he gets cut in the ground he is different class. I have a very soft spot for Dr Devious but he could not have produced a performance like this\\". On 14 June, Turtle Island started 15/8 favourite for the St James's Palace Stakes on firm ground at Royal Ascot, but after briefly taking the lead in the straight he finished third behind Grand Lodge and Distant View. After a break two and a half months he returned in Celebration Mile at Goodwood Racecourse. He was made the 11/10 favourite but finished third of six runners behind the filly Mehthaaf. Turtle Island's last race was the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in September, when he finished sixth of the nine runners behind the 66/1 outsider Maroof. Stud record Turtle Island was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion made a very impressive start to his stud career, siring the 2000 Guineas winner Island Sands in his first crop of foals. His other offspring included the Prix d'Astarte winner Turtle Bow. He later established himself as a sire of National Hunt horses including Seabass, Bensalem (December Gold Cup) Scolardy (Triumph Hurdle) and An Cathaoir Mor (Arkle Novice Chase) and was moved to Coolmore's The Beeches stud in 2005. He was exported to Sicily in 2010 where he stood at the Allevamento Torre di Canicarao.

It is the sequel to Shadow of the Beast and Shadow of the Beast II. Plot and gameplay In this game, Aarbron has regained his human shape but must defeat Maletoth once and for all to become fully human. Shadow of the Beast III has four distinct stages instead of one big area. The game places less of an emphasis on the action elements so prominent in the first two games, instead preferring a more cerebral approach. Development Shadow of the Beast III began development in October 1990, and was developed in two years. The graphics for Shadow of the Beast III were developed by Martin Edmondson on an Amiga A3000 using DPaint IV. Beast III was coded on a 25Mhz PC running PDS 2. The One interviewed Mark Jones, Shadow of the Beast III's graphic artist, for information regarding its development in a pre-release interview. Edmondson notes that the original selling point of Shadow of the Beast was its graphics, stating that \\"Apart from how many colours and layers of parallax and monsters we could squeeze on screen, no thought went into it whatsoever\\", and expresses that Beast III will 'retain the characteristic look and feel of the original' alongside significant changes. Edmondson states that \\"Beast I was a graphics showcase and some people found Beast II too difficult ... In Beast III our aims are to keep it looking good, retain the puzzles of Beast II and make it easier. It's going to be much more accessible.\\" The non-linear game structure eased graphic design, and Edmondson expresses that \\"For me it's [much easier] to start off drawing a forest than to gradually create a forest environment you can walk into.\\" Edmondson and Beast III's programmer Paul Howarth outline their ideals of a 'good action game', stating that \\"The most important thing is the feel. If the game is very bulky to control, things stick when they hit walls and the collision detection is a bit naff, it's very annoying to play, no matter how addictive the gameplay might be. The whole thing should run very smoothly and be easy to pick up and move around.\\", and furthermore emphasises the importance of overall appearance, saying that \\"You can have an excellent game but if it looks really, really bad it's not going to sell because you've got a problem with screenshots. They're not going to attract anybody so no- one's going to buy the game.\\" In Beast III's development, graphics were prioritized, with Edmondson stating that planning began with \\"we say what we want the background to look like - whether we need a hazy skyscape, mountains [etc.] ... then we concentrate on the lighting effect.\\" Background objects were drawn as free-hand drawings, and then digitized. After planning graphics, the game speed, scrolling, how the main character functions, and the controls are discussed. Edmondson expresses that after this planning, \\"Then we try and wind a game around these ideas if we can.\\" Edmondson states that \\"We must be the only people left who don't use SNASM - we just find it too slow\\" and expresses that he personally considers specially designed editors and utilities 'a waste of time.' Edmondson goes on to state that \\"a lot of people write very complicated map designers and editors, but I can't see the point in justifying spending three months writing something like that ... We use the most basic tools we possibly can, so we just get stuck into the game and work exclusively on that.\\" None of the data from the first two games is reused, and Edmondson explains that \\"It's probably slower to mess around with original code than to write it again. On top of that there's the problem that the original code for Beast I was so bad. It was the first thing we really did seriously and when you look back on it, it's very slow and inefficient and could have been done 10 times better. We always like to start from scratch.\\" One of the most difficult aspects of Beast III's development was parallax scrolling; Edmondson compares Beast I and II's methods of scrolling, saying that \\"In Beast I, we chose the most obvious and the easiest way of doing it, but the problem with that was that you couldn't have monsters running over the foreground at the same time. They had to be very spaced out and nowhere near interesting parts of the map ... [For Beast II] we fixed it so that we could have monsters around ladders and bits of buildings, but the background suffered and basically just a silhouette.\\" The parallax scrolling technique developed for Beast III allows monsters to be in points of interest without sacrificing looks, but Edmondson remarks that it's \\"very processor intensive\\" and as result took \\"months and months just to get it going.\\" Another complication in the development of Beast III's parallax scrolling is that North American Amigas run at 60 MHz while European Amigas run at 50 MHz, which resulted in graphical glitches on the NA Amiga during testing. Beast III's graphics make use of horizontal and vertical sprite multiplexing and horizontal and vertical colour interrupts. Production The package did not contain a T-shirt; instead, a badge with a game logo was included. A Sega Genesis version was considered and even developed at some point, with Matt Furniss tasked as the composer. The music for Shadow of the Beast II and III was composed and produced by Tim Wright. These titles featured a more extensive soundtrack and utilised ethnic samples taken from among other sources the same Korg M1 synthesizer that was sampled by David Whittaker for the original game (although in this case, it was the rack-mounted version the Korg M1/R). Beast 3 contained a total of 24 tracks again featuring ethnic instrumentation, but this time dabbling with the addition of some more synthetic sounds. Reception Computer Gaming World gave Shadow of the Beast III a mixed review. The magazine called the graphics \\"very good\\" and music \\"excellent\\" but criticized the puzzles' high level of difficulty, lack of a save game feature, and slow load times (and copy protection that prevented the use of a hard drive), stating \\"I have grown tired of arcade games that punish the player rather than reward them for their efforts\\".

She was one of the first African-American women to achieve a Ph.D. in mathematics. Currently, Jones works as a consultant for the development of college mathematics curriculums, and as a speaker at events to encourage women and minorities to pursue careers in science and mathematics. Early life Jones was born to George Herbert Green and Lillian Vaughn Green on August 10 of 1929 in Norfolk, Virginia. She was the second of six children, all of whom went on to earn, at minimum, a bachelor's degree. Jones attended Booker T. Washington High School, a segregated public school. Jones began her academic career early, after graduating as valedictorian of her high school in 1945 at the age of 15. She then attended Howard University with two scholarships, one from the university and one from the Pepsi-Cola Corporation. Jones was fortunate to be mentored by Elbert Frank Cox, the first African-American person to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics, as well as David Blackwell, another notable African- American mathematician. In addition to Jones majoring in mathematics, she minored in physics and education. She graduated cum laude from Howard University in 1949 and completed her master's degree the following year. Career After completing her master's degree, Jones went back to Booker T. Washington High School, this time to teach. In addition to her role as an educator, she developed a new curriculum for the high school's mathematics program. Jones wed Edward Dawley, Jr. in 1951 and took time off from teaching in 1953 to start a family. She returned to teaching in 1955, this time as a mathematics instructor at Hampton Institute (presently Hampton University), near Norfolk. In 1957, when all-white public schools were integrated, the segregated public schools in Norfolk were closed. This left many African- American youth with no place to attend school, leading Jones to begin tutoring these students at Norfolk's First Baptist Church. Jones also became active in the civil rights movement, achieving the rank of vice chair in Virginia's branch of CORE (Congress for Racial Equality) from 1958 to 1960. Following a divorce, Jones decided to pursue a doctorate, as Hampton Institute would only give tenure to instructors with doctorates. At the time, Virginia did not permit black students to pursue doctorates in the state, so Jones relocated with her two sons to Syracuse University in New York in 1962. She received a National Science Foundation fellowship in 1963 and began to work as a teaching assistant at Syracuse University. Jones received her doctorate in 1966. As an associate professor, Jones returned to the Hampton Institute for the 1966‚Äì67 academic year, until she joined the Norfolk State University mathematics department in 1967. Jones continued to teach at NSU for more than 30 years, where she continued her education through summer postgraduate courses at New York State University in 1957, at the University of Southern California in 1959‚Äì60, and at the University of Oregon in 1971. Education and research In 1945, Jones attended Howard University with two scholarships, one from the university and one from the Pepsi-Cola Corporation. Jones was fortunate to be mentored by Elbert Frank Cox, the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics, as well as David Blackwell, another notable African-American mathematician. In addition to Jones majoring in mathematics, she minored in physics and education. She graduated cum laude from Howard University in 1949 and completed her master's degree the following year. Following a divorce from Edward Armistead Dawley Jr., Jones decided to pursue a doctorate, as Hampton Institute would only give tenure to instructors with doctorates. At the time, Virginia did not permit black students to pursue doctorates in the state, so Jones relocated with her two sons to Syracuse University in New York in 1962. She received a National Science Foundation fellowship in 1963 and began to work as a teaching assistant at Syracuse University to support her family. Jones received her doctorate in 1966. In 1966, under the supervision of James D. Reid, PhD., Jones wrote her thesis entitled \\"Abelian Groups and Their Endomorphism Rings and the Quasi-Endomorphisms of Torsion Free Abelian Groups.\\" Awards and distinctions In 1965, she was elected to the Sigma Xi science honour society in Syracuse University, and became a full member in 1985. In 1975, Dr. Jones was elected Vice President of NAM. In 1994, Jones received the National Association of Mathematicians Distinguished Service Award. 1983-86: Sat on the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America. 1989-94: Board member of the Association for Women in Mathematics. Since 1990, she has served on the committee for opportunities in mathematics for underrepresented minorities for the American Mathematical Society. Selected published work *Kenschaft, P.

This differs fundamentally from the traditional electromechanical storage, which records data using rotating or linearly moving media coated with magnetic material. Solid-state storage devices typically store data using electrically- programmable non-volatile flash memory, however some devices use battery- backed volatile random-access memory (RAM). Having no moving mechanical parts, solid-state storage is much faster than traditional electromechanical storage; as a downside, solid-state storage is significantly more expensive and suffers from the write amplification phenomenon. Solid-state storage devices come in various types, form factors, sizes of storage space, and interfacing options to satisfy application requirements for many different types of computer systems and appliances.  Overview  Historically, secondary storage in computer systems has been implemented primarily by using magnetic properties of the surface coatings applied to rotating platters (in hard disk drives and floppy disks) or linearly moving narrow strips of plastic film (in tape drives). Pairing such magnetic media with read/write heads allows data to be written by separately magnetizing small sections of the ferromagnetic coating, and read later by detecting the transitions in magnetization. For the data to be read or written, exact sections of the magnetic media need to pass under the read/write heads that flow closely to the media surface; as a result, reading or writing data imposes delays required for the positioning of magnetic media and heads, with the delays differing depending on the actual technology. An illustration of the write amplification phenomenon in flash- based storage devices Over time, the performance gap between the central processing units (CPUs) and electromechanical storage (hard disk drives and their RAID setups) widened, requiring advancements in the secondary storage technology. A solution was found in flash memory, which is an electronic non- volatile computer storage media that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. Solid-state storage typically uses the NAND type of flash memory, which may be written and read in chunks much smaller than the entire size of the storage device. The size of a minimal chunk (page) for read operations is much smaller than the minimal chunk size (block) for write/erase operations, resulting in an undesirable phenomenon called write amplification that limits the random write performance and write endurance of flash-based solid-state storage devices. Another type of solid-state storage devices uses volatile random-access memory (RAM) combined with a battery that allows the contents of RAM to be preserved for a limited amount of time after the device's power supply is interrupted. As an advantage, RAM-based solid-state storage is much faster compared to flash, and does not experience write amplification. As a result of having no moving mechanical parts, solid-state storage virtually eliminates the data access latencies present in electromechanical storage devices, and allows significantly higher rates of I/O operations per second (IOPS). Additionally, solid-state storage allows much faster sequential access to stored data, consumes less power, has better physical shock resistance, and produces less heat and no vibrations during operation. As a downside, solid-state storage devices have much higher per- megabyte prices than electromechanical storage devices, and generally come in significantly smaller per-device capacities. Moreover, flash-based devices experience the memory wear that reduces their service life by imposing a limited amount of data that may be written to them, resulting from the limitations of flash memory that impose a finite number of program-erase cycles used to write data. As a result, solid-state storage is frequently used for the creation of hybrid drives, in which solid-state storage serves as a cache for frequently accessed data instead of being a complete substitute for the traditional secondary storage.  Device types  Solid-state storage devices serve as secondary storage components for more complex systems, which may range from embedded and portable devices to large servers and dedicated network-attached storage (NAS) systems. As a result, solid-state storage devices exist in different capacities, physical layouts and dimensions, using various interfaces and providing different feature sets. Less complex solid- state storage devices such as memory cards use simpler, slower interfaces such as the one-bit SD interface or SPI, while more sophisticated high-performance devices use faster interfaces such as Serial ATA (SATA) or PCI Express (PCIe) paired with logical device interfaces such as AHCI or NVM Express (NVMe). Types of flash-based solid-state storage devices include the following: * MultiMediaCard (MMC) a memory card type used in portable devices * Secure Digital (SD) a memory card type available in different variants, speeds and sizes, used extensively in portable devices * Solid-state drive (SSD) a computer storage device available in various form factors, with different interfaces, and in various classes targeting different market segments * USB flash drive pocketable removable storage devices that interface through USB, available in various shapes and sizes  See also  * Drum memory a magnetic data storage device used as the main working memory in many early computers * i-RAM a DRAM-based solid-state storage device produced by Gigabyte, operating as a SATA hard disk drive * Magnetic storage the concept of storing data on a magnetised medium using different patterns of magnetisation * RAM drive a block of random-access memory that the operating system treats as if it were secondary storage * Sequential access memory a class of data storage devices that read stored data in a sequence * Wear leveling a technique for prolonging the service life of some kinds of erasable computer storage media, such as flash memory  References  External links  * Solid-State Storage: Technology, Design and Applications, IBM, May 4, 2010, by Richard Freitas and Lawrence Chiu * USB Flash Wear Leveling and Life Span FAQ, Corsair, June 2007, archived from the original on October 13, 2007 Category:Solid-state computer storage ","title":"Solid-state storage"},{"id":"41886500","title":"2014 Trofeo Faip‚ÄìPerrel"},{"id":"41886505","text":"George Radin (January 22, 1931 ‚Äì May 21, 2013) was an American computer scientist.

The fieldstone from which it was constructed, some of which is still intact today, came from Colonial gristmills along Gulph Creek. Later history and ownership In 1901, the property was purchased by Ledyard Heckscher from Samuel Broadbent, a prominent Philadelphia businessman and politician. Two paintings painted by his wife still hang in the mansion's living room. The Heckscher's hired architect R. Brognard Okie to renovate, remodel, and enlarge the mansion. In 1949, Bolingbroke was bought by Roy J. Mckee and his wife. Ten years later, St. Martin's Episcopal Church acquired the property and grounds from the McKee's for their parish house.

History It was founded on grounds that had been expropriated by the Ghislieri family from the Bentivoglio. It was constructed by the canons of San Giorgio in Alga, an island in the lagoon of Venice; the architects were Tibaldo Tibaldi (Tibaldo Cristoforo di Tibaldi) and Giovanni Antonio, both from Milan. In 1676, it passed to the order of Clerics Regular ministering to the sick (Chierici Regolari Ministri degli Infermi). The earthquake of 1780 damaged the church, and it was rebuilt by the architect Angelo Venturoli.

He was a veteran parliamentarian towards the end of the Nigerian first republic and was given the Defense portfolio in 1965 after the death of Muhammadu Ribadu. He was first elected in 1951 as a member of the Northern House of Assembly, he was subsequently nominated to the Federal House of Representatives and was a member and later minister from 1951-1966. Inuwa Wada was known by many as a quiet figure in contrast to the hectic demands of his ministerial portfolio in the Works department which was going through a period of increased focus on major developmental projects as part of a six-year plan during the early 1960s.  Life  Born in 1917 to a respected family in Kano, his grandfather was Chief Alkali during the early twentieth century and his father worked as a surveyor for the Kano Native Authority before his death in 1924. Wada attended Shuhuci Elementary School and in 1938, he graduated from the Kano Middle School. He then went on to train as a teacher at the Katsina Higher College from 1933-1938 and later became a teacher in Kano where he taught History, English and Geography and also edited a paper, 'Yadda Yake Yau'. After putting nine years in teaching, he left the profession for the offices of the Kano Native Authority and worked there as a clerk, Chief Scribe and Information Officer.  Politics  Wada began in politics in 1945 and was a founding member of the Northern People's Congress. While in the NPC, he was the party's secretary and national organizer. In the 1950s, he served on the board of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, the Nigerian Coal Corporation and the Nigerian Groundnut Marketing Board. In the 1964 election, he had to contend with a Young NEPU candidate who was a School teacher by name Musa Said Abubakar Magami and future governor of Kano, Abubakar Rimi who contested as an independent candidate but all of them pulled out of the race before the elections were contested. Wada is a paternal uncle of the late Murtala Mohammed, former Nigerian Head of State. He ran a fairly successful transport business after the 1966 coup that abolished the first republic. He also remained an influential conservative figure in the Northern region after the coup.  Business career  Wada secured a loan from the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank to start his first manufacturing venture, a match making company. He later owned interest in at least five other business ventures including a transport company. His breakthrough in the transport sector occurred when he bought 50 lorries for a small deposit, other ventures included the Nigerian Spanish Engineering Company, Kanol Paints, Arewa Industries, Standard Industrial Industries and Nigerian Enamelware Company.

He leads the band Zydeco Magic. Andre was born in Richmond, California, on July 9, 1979, to Olivia \\"Tee\\" Guillory originally from Basile, Louisiana, and Gregory Thierry, originally from Jennings, Louisiana. Andre Thierry's childhood was deeply influenced by his maternal grandparents, the late Houston Pete Pitre (Pa-Pa as they called him) from Basile, Louisiana, and his grandmother, known by many as Mama Lena Pitre, from Soileau, Louisiana. > In America, great migrations produce great music.

Now > the California scenes rival anything back home in Louisiana, and that's due > to players like Andre Thierry, a standard bearer for the new generation. > Thierry is among the best of both the West Coast and the Gulf Coast, and he > combines youthful vigor with a mature appreciation for his inherited > tradition.Tisserand, Michael. The Kingdom of Zydeco, Arcade Publishing, 1998 Thierry grew up experiencing the French Creole (La-La) dances his grandparents held at their church parish, St. Mark's Catholic Church. The best Zydeco musicians Louisiana had to offer traveled to California to play at the dances and spent considerable time at the Pitres' house while in the area. On one such visit, the \\"King of Zydeco\\", Clifton Chenier, grabbed three-year-old Andre by the arms and deemed him a future accordion player. From then on, Andre's father encouraged the young Andre to play the accordion. Captivated by Chenier, Thierry began teaching himself to play by listening to Clifton's music. Andre demonstrated an innate musical ability and his skill quickly grew. Andre played his first song, Willis Prudhomme's version of \\"Give‚Äôm Cornbread\\", in the backyard of his grandparents' home. He soon began playing Chenier's music on stages all over Northern California. His grandparents continued to host Louisiana musicians and this exposure to his heritage allowed him to develop his love for, and mastery of, traditional French Creole music. By age twelve, with the help of his mother, Thierry formed his own band, \\"Zydeco Magic\\". Andre's repertoire grew as he was regularly invited to play with numerous visiting bands, such as the late John Delafose, his son, Geno Delafose, and many local Zydeco and Cajun bands, including the late Danny Poullard (California Cajun Orchestra). Thierry is a virtuoso on the accordion. Although Andre's instrument of choice is the accordion he also displays talent on bass guitar, rhythm guitar and drums. He sings traditional songs in original Creole French and his voice has been characterized as rich and soulful.

His service extended from 1993 to 2009. Background Talton graduated in 1963 from Pasadena High School and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. Talton is a former police officer, prosecutor, city attorney of Pearland, municipal court judge in Pasadena. He is currently an attorney in private practice. Talton holds a law degree from the South Texas College of Law in Houston. He is a former general counsel for the Harris County Republican Party. He and his wife, Sue, have two children and five grandchildren. He is a former United States Air Force reservist. Political life In his first election to the House, Talton narrowly defeated the Democrat Donald Peter Fogo, 13,400 (50.1 percent) to 13,323 (49.9 percent). His victory was contested but resolved by the House in his favor on February 15, 1993. In Talton's first term, he represented Deer Park, rather than Pasadena. Talton was succeeded by another Republican, Ken Legler, again by a narrow margin. Legler polled 19,980 votes (51.2 percent) to 19,078 (48.8 percent) for the Democrat Joel C. Redmond. Rather than seeking reelection to the State House, Talton ran unsuccessfully in 2008 for the United States House of Representatives from Texas' 22nd congressional district, but the position went to Pete Olson, a former chief of staff to U.S. Senator John Cornyn. In his last legislative session, Talton sponsored unsuccessful legislation to allow a peace officer to inquire into the immigration status of a suspect. He served in his later tenure on the Civil Practices and Criminal Jurisprudence committees. Talton voted exceptionally conservative while serving in the House. He was given high ratings by the National Rifle Association, the Young Conservatives of Texas, Texas Right to Life, and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, which in 2007 dubbed him the \\"most conservative member of the House\\". In 2005, Capitol Inside designated Talton the \\"top conservative legislator\\" in Texas. When Talton ran for Congress, he was endorsed by Houston Christian Magazine. The interest group, Americans for Prosperity, awarded him the title of \\"Defender of the American Dream\\" for his support for reduced taxation and cuts in state spending. Talton lost a race in 2012 for county attorney in Harris County to the Democratic incumbent Vince Ryan. The position handles civil litigation in the county, while the district attorney deals with criminal matters. Talton also lost the Republican primary election held on March 4, 2014, in a challenge to incumbent Nathan L. Hecht of Dallas for Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Governor Rick Perry appointed Hecht to the position upon the resignation in 2013 of Wallace B. Jefferson. After filing for the position, Talton reported that all of the $30,000 he raised for the race came from one source, Houston trial attorney Mark Lanier, who also backed unsuccessful challengers to two other Republican Supreme Court justices, Jeff Brown and Phil Johnson. Hecht won re-nomination with 707,692 (60.5 percent) to Talton's 462,273 (39.5 percent).

By the time of the dot-com crash, Altavoz continued to provide stock to thousands of independent stores, big box stores and was receiving 1.2 million hits a day on the official website. In 2011, Jacobsen took a new leadership role in the company as CEO. In 2013, Altavoz began online presentations for distribution deals exporting US-made music. Part of the incorporation of Altavoz included the non-profit \\"Help Earth Foundation.\\" On September 25, 2015, Max Media Group, Inc. (MXMI) announced that its board of directors had voted unanimously to transfer a majority of the control of MXMI to Altavoz Entertainment. As of the end of 2015, Jacobsen, a board member of MXMI, continues to lead Altavoz as CEO.

He was arrested in 1998 for the rape and murder of 11 women and for assaulting nine others in a S√£o Paulo park.Folha de S. Paulo Early life Francisco de Assis Pereira was born on November 29, 1967 in S√£o Paulo. He experienced sexual trauma in his childhood, with a maternal aunt sexually harassing him, after which he developed a fixation on breasts. As an adult, he was seduced by his boss to engage in homosexual relationships. In one such relationship with a Goth girl, the man almost ripped off Pereira's penis, making him fear losing his reproductive organ. Pereira showed a darker side even before the murders. Thayna, a travesti with whom he lived for more than a year, constantly reported that Francisco had punched her in the stomach and slapped in the face, just as some of the surviving women had reported. Because of the incident with the gothic man, he felt pain during the sexual act, and the impossibility of pleasure is suspect of being the reason for Pereira's murder spree. Investigation Prior to the investigation of the murders, Pereira had already been summoned to testify with the DHPP to clarify the use of a check sheet in the name of Isadora Fraenkel, which he had used for the purchase of a helmet; having alleged the use of the check with Fraenkel's consent (she was not his girlfriend, but rather a randomly chosen victim), he was released soon after. At the time of the murders, Pereira worked as a motoboy at a company near the police station that investigated the crimes. The owner at the time reported the employee's strange attitude days before the DHPP's visit, and that he had left a note reporting of his sudden resignation and departure from the company. The day before the murderer made a slip when he approached a girl in the midst of her daily feeding routine of her psychosis, which he mentioned not being able to accompany him at that moment (fact had already occurred amidst massive investigations and mass media disclosures, his murders and a means of approaching the victims); this girl then notified that she had been given by the killer of a business card with the name of Jean, with the telephone number of the company where he worked, and in case of interest in his proposal, that she would seek him out. This girl reported the incident to the DHPP, who immediately contacted the phone with the motoboys company she had previously investigated in response to the opposite side of the call; the owner then informed of Pereira's departure, leaving only the newspaper that showed his spoken picture, as well as a farewell message. Pereira was extroverted and convincing, leaving the victims to describe their present situation, usually of conflict in their relationships, to use this information for the conquest and conviction of the girls. He worked mainly in the Metro, more frequently in the lines connected to the station of Jabaquara, where he approached his victims with the promise of participation in photo shoots of a large cosmetics company, usually focusing on women with apparent emotional discomfort, which the delinquent described as \\"sad\\" and \\"head low,\\" with apparent susceptibility to approaching strangers. When he disappeared, he only left a newspaper and a note on the table. He regretted having to leave, apologizing for the sudden action: Pereira found his victims by posing as a talent scout for a modeling agency. He would often use shoelaces to strangle his victims after raping them. Pereira worked as a motorcycle courier during the course of the crimes. Pereira was arrested on August 4, 1998 in Itaqui, Rio Grande do Sul, ending a 23-day manhunt when he was reported to police after fisherman Jo√£o Carlos Villaverde, who he was staying with, saw his picture on television. He also indicated the location of Selma's bones, which had not yet been found by the police in the State Park. After being captured by the police, what most impressed the authorities was how an unarmed man could convince the women to climb the rump of a motorcycle and go into the middle of a thicket with a man they had just met. Today the killer is a record holder receiving letters at the prison, the convict even married an admirer, having separated later times with reports of the ex-bride, of strangeness in his actions and personality. Pereira will be released in 2028 after completing the maximum 30 years of seclusion required by Brazilian law, and noted psychiatrists indicate the certainty that he will commit another offense due to his pseudo psychopathic, irreversible state of mind. Murders=Elis√¢ngela Francisco da Silva Elis√¢ngela Francisco da Silva was a 21-year-old from Paran√°, coming from a poor Londrina family, who had been living with her aunt Solange Barbosa in S√£o Paulo since 1996. Due to financial difficulties, she left school in the 7th grade. After being left by a friend at the Eldorado Mall in the West Zone of S√£o Paulo, she was never seen again. Her naked body was found on July 28 in the State Park. The already decomposed body required hard work so it could be identified, and she was identified only three days later. \\"I hoped it was not her.\\", her aunt said. On the day of her disappearance, Elis√¢ngela left home saying that she would return in two hours. Raquel Mota Rodrigues The great ambition of 23-year-old Raquel Mota Rodrigues was to earn money to help her family, who lived in Gravata√≠, Rio Grande do Sul. On weekends, she went out to bars with three friends, never going after midnight. Around 8 o'clock on the night of January 9, she left the furniture store where she worked as a saleswoman, in the Pinheiros neighborhood. Upon arriving at the Jabaquara station, almost at home, she called her cousin L√≠gia, saying that she had met a young man and accepted his offer of posing as a model for him in Diadema, S√£o Paulo. Her cousin warned her not go, saying it was too risky to go out with a stranger. Raquel replied that she won't go, but never returned home. Her body was found in the thicket of the State Forest on January 16. Selma Ferreira Queiroz Queiroz was a minor and the youngest of three sisters, intending to study accounting or computer science. Her plans, however, were cut short in the afternoon of July 3. She disappeared in the area between her house in Cotia and centre of S√£o Paulo, where she would deal with the formalities related to her dismissal as a drugstore clerk. The next day a man called Sara, Selma's sister, claiming that the girl had been kidnapped and asked for a ransom of 1,000 reais. He said that he call back later that afternoon, but he didn't. That same day, Selma's body was found in the State Park. She was naked, with signs of rape and beating. Bite marks were also found on shoulders, breasts and legs. Selma had been strangled, a little bit after she had informed her boyfriend that she wouldn't be able to come in time to watch the 1998 FIFA World Cup with him, but was on the way to his residence. Patr√≠cia Gon√ßalves Marinho At the age of 24, Marinho had never revealed to her family that she had dreamed of being a model. On April 17, after leaving the house of her grandmother Josefa, with whom she lived, the girl disappeared. Her body was discovered on July 28, in a deserted area of the State Park. Identification of the body was only possible thanks to the clothes and jewelry found next to the body. She was raped and then strangled to death. Letters The famous murderer received several letters from admirers in jail, including the following: The journalist and writer Gilmar Rodrigues published in 2009 the book \\"Loucas de Amor - women who love serial killers and sexual criminals\\" (Editorial \\"Ideas a Bulk\\"), where he tried to understand why the maniac was wanted by so many women. He was impressed by the one thousand letters of love the felon received a month after he was arrested in 1998.  Sentence and aftermath  He was eventually sentenced to a total of 268 years in prison. Pereira would go on to say \\"I was possessed by an evil force.\\" and \\"I am a person with a good and a bad personality. Sometimes I am not able to dominate this dark side. I pray, I pray, but I cannot resist and then I chase after women. I wished that they would not go with me into the park, that they would run away.\\" After being caught he claimed he was about to start cannibalizing his victims. On December 18, 2000, inmates tried to kill Pereira during a riot at the Taubat√© House of Custody and Psychiatric Treatment and four inmates were killed. Pereira was then moved to another psychiatric facility. He had said that he considers himself a \\"normal person\\", and that, according to him, he is alive because of his faith. Pereira also claimed that what he had done in the past would not have been a result of his own will, but of an \\"evil thing, damn it.\\" He met his current wife Jussara through letters while imprisoned, with her trying to solve his legal problems. \\"She is intelligent, has a great background and a degree in History and Geography\\", he boasted. An Ibope survey for the Public Prosecutor's Office in 2004 showed that this case is most remembered by Brazilians, with a 76% index, the most remembered police case between 2006 and 2007.Veja Magazine  References Bibliography * Luisa Alcalde and Luis Carlos dos Santos: \\"Hunt for the Park Maniac\\".

Marinelli's father was a surgeon and a dedicated Jacobin.Encyclopedia Treccani, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 70 (2007) entry by Rosalba Dinoia. At the age of 17 years, he moved to Naples to complete his literary and scientific studies. By the age of 22 years, he dedicated himself to painting, and studied under Costanzo Angelini at the Royal Institute of Fine Arts of Naples. Obtaining a scholarship from the Province of Basilicata, from 1842 to 1848, he studied in Rome at the Academy under Tommaso Minardi. Returning to Naples after the restoration, he traveled through Greece working for Otto, King of Greece. He visited the Greek isles, and painted for the Cathedral of Rethymno in Crete. He then traveled to Egypt, where he completed works for the Ottoman Khedive, Muhammad Sa'id Pasha, accompanying him on a nine-month trip to Sudan. Back in Naples in 1859, ten years later he was invited to the inauguration of the Suez Canal, he returned to Egypt and traveled up to the first cataract of the Nile. Again returning to Italy, he won a contest in 1875 to become Professor of design and figure at the Royal Institute of Fine Arts a Naples, and in 1881, upon the death of Domenico Morelli, he was named professor of painting of Royal Institute. He taught from 1865 to 1887 at the Royal Educandato Femminile Regina Maria Pia. He died in Naples on 18 January 1892. Among his works are: Parnassus and Great Poets of Antiquity in 17 life size canvases for the Royal Palace in Athens; two large altarpieces: Assumption of the Virgin and Baptism of Christ in the Jordan for the Cathedral of San Antonio of Padua in Rethymno; a canvas of recollecting his trip to Sudan, Khedive Said Pasha ordering the caravan to form, Ballo dell' ape nell Harem (Dance of the Bee in the Harem), and le Baiadere exhibited in 1862 at the first International Exposition of London; Cleopatra and her handmaidens receive Antonio;Cleopatra and her handmaidens was commissioned by King Vittorio Emanuele and once found next to Ballo dell'ape in the Pinacoteca di Capodimonte.

Federal Communications Commission was a 2014 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit case vacating portions of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 that the court determined could only be applied to common carriers. The court ruled that the FCC did not have the authority to impose the order in its entirety. Because the FCC had previously classified broadband providers under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, the court ruled that the FCC had relinquished its right to regulate them like common carriers. The case was largely viewed as a loss for network neutrality supporters and a victory for the cable broadband industry. Of the three orders that make up the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, two were vacated (no blocking and no unreasonable discrimination) and one was upheld (transparency). Judge David S. Tatel wrote the opinion with Judge Judith Ann Wilson Rogers joining. Judge Laurence H. Silberman wrote a separate decision concurring in part and dissenting in part. Background At issue was whether the FCC could regulate Internet service providers with regards to network neutrality. On June 27, 2005, in National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, The United States Supreme Court applying the Chevron doctrine upheld a determination by the FCC that cable Internet providers were an \\"information service,\\" and not a \\"telecommunications service\\" as classified under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. BrandX had argued that the FCC must regulate cable Internet providers as common carriers under the Communications Act of 1934. BrandX lost, and this case set an important precedent with the FCC classifying cable Internet providers as \\"information services.\\" On April 6, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held, in Comcast Corp. v. FCC, that the FCC did not have ancillary jurisdiction over Comcast's Internet service under the language of the Communications Act of 1934. Since the FCC had already classified cable Internet providers as information services, the court ruled that the FCC could not censure Comcast's interference with their customers' peer-to-peer traffic. The Comcast ruling lead the FCC to issue its FCC Open Internet Order 2010 in December 2010. On January 20, 2011, Verizon sued the FCC, arguing that the order was exceeding the FCC's authority as authorized by Congress, violated the company's constitutional rights, and created uncertainty for the communications industry. MetroPCS also brought suit against the FCC shortly after Verizon, but dropped its suit on May 17, 2013. Holding The court first defines their task as, \\"not to assess the wisdom of the Open Internet Order regulations, but rather to determine whether the Commission has demonstrated that the regulations fall within the scope of its statutory grant of authority.\\" The court then sets about breaking up the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 into its constituent parts and either vacating or upholding each part. The court vacated two parts of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, determining that the FCC did not have the authority to impose these orders without classifying network providers as common carriers. Since the FCC had previously classified broadband providers as \\"information services\\" and not \\"telecommunications services,\\" they could not be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Therefore, the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 regulations, which could only be applied to common carriers, could not be applied to broadband providers. The court upheld the transparency order of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, which it found was not contingent upon network operators being classified as common carriers. Additionally, the court found that section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \\"vests the FCC with affirmative authority to enact measures encouraging the deployment of broadband infrastructure.\\" The court mostly agreed with the FCC's interpretation of section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The court also agreed with the FCC that broadband providers represent a threat to Internet openness and could hinder future Internet development without at least rules similar to those in the FCC Open Internet Order 2010. The court suggested possible changes to the FCC's regulations that may be more amenable to their opinion. Effect on 2010 Open Internet Order The FCC Open Internet Order 2010 established three orders on fixed and mobile operators of Internet access. ; Transparency This order was applied to both fixed and mobile operators. It requires them to publicly disclose accurate information regarding their network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service. This order was not vacated by the court. ; No blocking This order was applied to both fixed and mobile operators. This order prevents blocking, or otherwise degrading so as to make unusable, access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. This order was canceled by the court. ; No unreasonable discrimination This order was applied only to fixed operators. This order forbids fixed network operators from unreasonably discriminating against lawful network traffic. The FCC did not order for mobile operators because, according to the FCC, competition in the mobile networking space rendered it unnecessary. This order was vacated by the court. Concurring/dissenting opinion Judge Laurence H. Silberman wrote his own opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part. His opinion is in general agreement with the majority that the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 \\"impermissibly subjects broadband providers to treatment as common carriers.\\" Of significance in this minority opinion is Silberman's ruling that the FCC has the authority to take \\"measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.\\" This has been interpreted to mean that the FCC has the authority to challenge state laws restricting municipal broadband. Reactions=Industry reaction Immediately following the decision, both Comcast and Verizon issued a statement that the Internet will continue to work for consumers. Verizon stated the ruling will result in more innovation and more choice for consumers. AT&T; stated that their commitment to network neutrality will not diminish. Time Warner Cable stated that their commitment to deliver the best service will not be compromised. As part of the Comcast NBC merger, Comcast was required to follow the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 for 7 years. They reiterated this commitment after the trial. On February 10, 2014, Netflix updated its ISP speed rankings with January 2014 data that show the average access speed via Verizon FiOS traffic was dropped down between December 2013 and January 2014. Ars Technica, a technology news and information website, suggested the possibility that the ruling might affect this sudden traffic speed drop. Pointing to Netflix's performance change, several news media pointed out that the battle began shifting from network neutrality frameworks to private peering deals, which had not been covered by the FCC Open Internet Order 2010. Government reaction In January 2014, in response to the ruling, a petition campaign was launched on the White House's petition site, urging President Obama to direct the FCC to reclassify ISPs as \\"common carriers\\". It received more than 105,000 signatures. On 18 February 2014, the Obama administration replied to the petition. It stated that although the President \\"vigorously supports\\" a robust, free and open Internet, he was not able to direct the FCC to do that because the FCC is an independent agency. On February 19, 2014, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, issued a statement responding to the court's decision and laying out their intentions for the future of network neutrality. The FCC stated that they will not appeal the decision, but will establish new rules for the transparency, the no blocking, and the non-discrimination, based on the decision. The FCC stated that it will keep \\"Title II authority on the table\\" and work \\"on a case by case basis\\" to evaluate whether standards of network neutrality are met by carriers. The FCC also opened a new proceeding asking for general public comment, and on April 24, the Chairman announced he would be circulating a draft Open Internet Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the next open FCC meeting on May 15. Additionally, the FCC laid out plans to start challenging state laws prohibiting municipal broadband, based in part on the dissenting opinion of Judge Laurence H. Silberman, who wrote that the FCC has the authority to take \\"measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.\\" Commentary Multiple news outlets claimed the Court ruling was the death of network neutrality in the United States. The court upheld the FCC's authority to regulate broadband providers to encourage nationwide broadband deployment, agreeing with the FCC's interpretation of section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Some legal observers believe this should allow the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as \\"telecommunications services\\" and therefore subject them to common carrier regulation. Legal scholar Annemarie Bridy predicted that the case will force the FCC's hand in reclassifying broadband providers as \\"telecommunications services,\\" something which the FCC has so far resisted doing. Legal scholar Susan P. Crawford also wrote that the FCC should move now to regulate broadband providers as common carriers in order to preserve network neutrality and civic life in the United States. In response to the FCC's decision of not appealing but establishing new rules, James P. Tuthill, an attorney and lecturer of UC Berkeley School of Law, criticized the decision as the agency could appeal the Supreme Court to seek review, and the Court would likely accept the case because of the significance of the issues and a request by a federal agency. He also predicted that even if the FCC would propose new rules, they would be challenged and overturned based on this case results as \\"simply calling a rose by another name will not change what it is, and the courts won't buy it.\\" In response to the FCC's plans to start challenging state laws prohibiting municipal broadband, reformer and law professor Susan P. Crawford believes promoting local municipal broadband may be the most effective way to provide broadband access. Some people, who have paid attention to the governmental regulation on the Internet, mentioned another aspect of the ruling. April Glaser, a staff activist at the EFF, noted that the ruling had an aspect of a bar against the FCC's approach to network neutrality. Various commentators pointed to the possibility that by invoking the court's interpretation of Section 706, the FCC could expand its regulative power to the Internet thereby threatening its freedom.

Early life Romero married young in Valdepe√±as, to Yolanda Saez, and they had two children. Saez was pregnant with the second child at the time of the first murders in 1993. Romero had a long history of sexual obsession, voyeurism and domestic violence against his wife and children. Nevertheless, he was not considered a threat by those outside his home. One of his favorite voyeurism spots was Valdepe√±as's public park, where he spied on couples kissing with little regard for being seen by them. The 'Crime of the Sweethearts' On June 18, 1993 Romero ambushed √Ångel Ib√°√±ez (24) and his girlfriend Sara Dotor (20) as they left the park and ordered them to go to an uninhabited, dark area next to a railway. He was armed with a double-bladed navaja and he pointed it to Ib√°√±ez's throat. Once there, Romero demanded the couple's money and Ib√°√±ez handed him his wallet. When Dotor said that she recognized Romero (he was the nephew of her brother's employer), Romero stabbed Ib√°√±ez multiple times in his left arm and thorax. He continued doing so after Ib√°√±ez was already dead. Dotor ran away, following the railway's fence in direction to Valdepe√±as's train station. After 85 meters, Romero caught up with her and delivered a single stab to the back of her neck that paralyzed her. He turned her over, molested her, inserted his fist in her vagina, and eventually beat and stabbed her in the thorax until she died. Romero took some of Dotor's clothes and threw them in the Jabal√≥n river, then disposed of the blade in an orchard's waterwheel some 100 meters from his residence. Saez testified later that Romero came back home at 1:25 AM and that, in the following days, he got rid of the clothes he was wearing that night and of two knives he used to carry. She suspected him from the beginning but did not report him to authorities. Five days later, Romero left Valdepe√±as for Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Murder of Rosana Maroto Romero returned to Valdepe√±as in 1997. He became friends with Dotor's brothers and would often ask how the investigation of their sister's murder was going. Over the following year, Romero worked putting up plasterboard, at a meat packing factory, and as a cook in a roadside brothel. Around 16:30 of June 25, 1998 Romero finished his shift at the brothel and left in his car. He drove on unpaved country roads only because he did not own a driver's license. While driving on a road called \\"La Membrilla\\" (not to be confused with the town of the same name), he happened upon 21-year-old Rosana Maroto, who was cycling from her home in Valdepe√±as to her father's country home, seven kilometers away. Maroto studied Art History in Ciudad Real and had returned to Valdepe√±as only two days before, following the end of the school year. She had no relationship with Romero. According to Romero, he hit Maroto by accident, exited the car, and tried to resuscitate her without success. He believed that she was dead, and fearing that this would out him as the murderer of Ib√°√±ez and Dotor, he resolved to put Maroto in the car's trunk and the bicycle in the backseat, and throw both in different water wells in the country. After disposing of the bicycle, he drove to an abandoned farmstead and began to undress Maroto. She then regained consciousness and asked what had happened and demanded to have her bicycle back. Again according to Romero, a discussion ensued and he ended strangling her with her shoelaces and throwing the body in an empty well that he covered with large stones. Though Maroto's body was largely skeletonized when it was recovered in 2003, Romero's DNA was found on it, which led to Romero being charged with rape and the prosecution stating that he had run Maroto over deliberately with the intention of raping her. Romero denied the charge, but he later testified that Maroto had agreed to practice fellatio and other sexual acts voluntarily in the farmstead. The Court did not believe this allegation. Maroto's disappearance gained notoriety in Spain when her backpack was found three days later in the area where she disappeared. It contained her running shoes, walkman and a cap smeared with her vomit. Police also found blood with male DNA in the backpack, which was kept from the public. Maroto's family met Prime Minister Aznar and the Ministry of the Interior offered 25 million pesetas for clues leading to the arrest of the murderer. In 2000, Maroto's bicycle was found in a well 300 meters from the place where the backpack was found. By 2003, Police had searched 300 of over 1000 wells located around Valdepe√±as, but the one with the body (four kilometers away from the abduction site) was not among them. Arrest and sentence Saez reported Romero to the authorities in 2003, after he assaulted her and told her afterward that he didn't care about the consequences because he had already killed several people. While being held in Herrera de la Mancha prison for domestic violence, Romero was informed that two witness testimonies and a DNA match tied him to the 1993 murders and the 1998 disappearance, respectively. Romero immediately collapsed and admitted to all three murders. Following his testimony, the Police's Special Operations Group retrieved the 1993 murder weapon and Maroto's body from their respective locations. In the ensuing trial, Romero's defense requested 26 years in prison for three homicides without premeditation only, denying any rape and claiming that the robbery charge had prescribed. Romero testified that he was motivated to rob the couple because of poverty caused by his lack of employment and family dependents, and that the murders were an unplanned escalation. However, it was found that at the time, Romero was actually earning 80,000 pesetas monthly on unemployment benefits and 25,000 more by working illegally in a bar. Because of this, the Court ruled that the robbery had actually been a distraction from the real motive of the murders, which was sexual, and that they were also premeditated. A psychiatric evaluation found that Romero had antisocial personality disorder, but could otherwise understand the nature and consequences of his actions. On April 22, 2005 Romero was sentenced to over 103 years in prison: 30 years in maximum prison for each murder, with the aggravating circumstances of premeditation and extreme cruelty; 12 for one rape, and 4 years, 2 months and 1 day in minimum prison for robbery. He was acquitted of the charge for Dotor's rape and another charge for Maroto's abduction. In addition, Romero was banned from Valdepe√±as for 10 years after his excarceration, could not contact the victims families for 5 years, and was forced to compensate them with 900,000 euro total. Other possible murders Police explored the possibility that Romero had attacked other women in Ciudad Real and the Canary Islands during the time he had resided there. Special interest was given to the murders of 15-year-old Inmaculada Arteaga in Campo de Criptana in 2001 and 31-year-old Juani D√≠az-Flores in Herencia on Valentine's Day, 2003. Both murders were attributed later to different criminals.

History On April 21, 1854, The Right Reverend William Ingraham Kip, Bishop of California, held the first Episcopal Church service in Nevada City. A group of Episcopalians formed a congregation and a year and a day later, the Parish of the Holy Trinity was formally organized and incorporated. The first Trinity Church was constructed at the corner of Main and Church Streets at a cost of $4000. It was dedicated in March 1863. During a conflagration in November of the same year, Trinity Church caught fire and only the bell and stained glass window could be salvaged. The congregation decided that their church must be moved away from the centre of the city to avoid any more fires. In 1869 a new site was purchased on Aristocracy Hill, a few hundred yards away across a valley from the former site and which was never affected by Nevada City's fires. It had been the site of Washington School, the first school in Nevada City when it was little more than a mining camp, but the growing population made a new school necessary. Built in a New England style at a cost of $5000, Trinity Church was dedicated on November 2, 1872. The stained glass window rescued from the fire was installed above the altar, and the bell was hung in the tower. The church has been at this new location at the corner of Nevada and High Streets ever since. It is said to have been modeled on St. James's Episcopal Church in Sonora, California.

Constructed shortly before the Civil War, it features a range of architectural details in classical architectural style. Although it changed owners in its early years, it was owned by members of the namesake Burton family for approximately a century, and it has been named a historic site. Although located in the city of Newberry, the house is built in the style of plantation houses in the countryside: it features Neoclassical components, although in a diminished and vernacular mode. The house is a two- story rectangle with a central portico dominating the facade. Square wooden pillars support each story of the portico, while pilasters in a similar style are placed at the portico's junctions with the main body of the house. As a second-story door provides access to the second story of the portico, the space between pillars and pilasters is filled with an unadorned balustrade. Multi-pane transom lights are placed above both the main entrance and the second-story door to the portico, in addition to sidelights around the main entrance. Topping the house is a gabled roof, which culminates in a pediment atop the portico. The entire house is a wooden building comprising nearly , although only about are finished. Three fireplaces are located throughout the building, which is underlain by a crawlspace.Owner and Parcel Information: Parcel 342-1-6-7, Newberry County, 2014-02-08. Accessed 2014-02-08. Although the precise date of construction for the Burton House is unknown, it was constructed circa 1857. From 1856 until 1858, the property was owned by one of Newberry's first men, William Walter Houseal, a merchant who was elected to hold local office. Thirty years after Houseal sold the property, it was bought by James A. Burton, who was active in the sale of insurance; a 1921 city directory records him as selling both real estate and fire insurance from an office on Caldwell Street, while still living in the house on Glenn Street.Newberry, S.C. City Directory. Vol. 3. Newberry and Asheville: Piedmont, 1922, 100. Burton's descendants owned the property into the 1980s, although it has since passed out of the family. In November 1980, the Burton House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture; it was part of a group of Newberry locations added to the Register together as part of a multiple property submission. It is one of twenty-four individual properties and historic districts listed on the National Register in the city of Newberry and the surrounding area.

It was held on September 30, 2014. The Royals won by a score of 9‚Äì8 in 12 innings, and advanced to play the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2014 American League Division Series. This was the second postseason meeting between the Athletics and Royals, having first met in the 1981 ALDS (Athletics won 3‚Äì0). The 12-inning contest tied the then record for the longest (by innings) \\"winner- take-all\\" game in postseason history, shared with Game 7 of the 1924 World Series. This record was subsequently broken by the 2018 National League Wild Card Game . Prelude=Kansas City Royals Despite preseason predictions that were generally bleak, the Royals won 89 games in the regular season, which represented the team's most wins since the 1985 season. Despite falling as far as seven games behind the division-leading Detroit Tigers well into the season, the Royals played very well during the latter half of the regular season to gain a playoffs spot as a wild card team. The 2014 American League Wild Card game represented the Royals' first postseason appearance since 1985. Oakland Athletics In contrast to the Royals, who had a better second half of the season, the Athletics had one of the best records in Major League Baseball early in the season, but slumped towards the end of the season. The Athletics also made several major trades to gain players like Jason Hammel and Jon Lester to bolster the team. Despite the late struggles, Oakland still won 88 games and secured a wild card spot, making 2014 the third straight season the team had made the playoffs. Game results=Line score The one-game playoff was touted as a duel between the Royals' James Shields and the Athletics' Jon Lester, but neither starting pitcher would earn a decision in the game. Oakland's Brandon Moss homered early off of Shields with Coco Crisp on base, giving the Athletics a 2‚Äì0 advantage; Kansas City halved the lead in the bottom of the first when Billy Butler singled to score Nori Aoki. Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer had RBI hits for the Royals in the third inning, vaulting Kansas City to a 3‚Äì2 lead. In this third inning, Oakland catcher Geovany Soto left the game with a thumb injury sustained in a play at the plate. Soto had started the game because he would be more adept at controlling the running game of the Royals. This would come back to haunt the Athletics later in the game. The fourth and fifth innings were scoreless, but a big sixth inning gave Oakland a large lead. Sam Fuld singled to lead off the inning, and Shields was relieved by Yordano Ventura after walking Josh Donaldson. Ventura's first batter, Moss, belted a three-run home run to give the Athletics a 5‚Äì3 lead. After Ventura was relieved by Kelvin Herrera, Derek Norris and Crisp singled in two additional runs. Both Oakland and Kansas City batted fruitlessly in the seventh inning, and Royals relief pitcher Wade Davis recorded three straight outs in the top of the eighth. In the bottom of the eighth, with Kansas City six outs away from having their season ended, the Royals manufactured a productive inning of their own. Alcides Escobar singled, and then stole second base with Nori Aoki at the plate. Lorenzo Cain singled, scoring Escobar. Cain stole second base himself with Eric Hosmer batting; Hosmer was then walked, at which point starting pitcher Jon Lester was relieved by Luke Gregerson. Nerves seemed to get the better of Gregerson, who allowed Billy Butler to single and score Cain, and then allowed Hosmer to score from third base on a wild pitch. After walking Alex Gordon Gregerson struck out the next two batters to preserve the Athletics' lead, but the Royals had crept to within one run. Closer Greg Holland took the mound for Kansas City and was somewhat shaky, walking three batters, but mustered the three required outs without major damage, and Kansas City took their one-run deficit to the bottom of the ninth. Oakland's closer, Sean Doolittle, pitched in relief of Gregerson. Pinch-hitter Josh Willingham hit a bloop single and was replaced by pinch-runner Jarrod Dyson. Dyson moved to second base on a successful bunt from Alcides Escobar, and then stole third with Aoki at bat. Aoki hit a deep sacrifice fly to right field for the second out of the inning, but Dyson was able to jog home, tying the game at 7‚Äì7 and completing the Royals' four-run comeback. Cain lined out to end the inning for Kansas City. Brandon Finnegan, who 3 months earlier had pitched for TCU in the College World Series, began a strong inning of work in the tenth, replacing Greg Holland and recording three outs in quick succession. The Royals advanced Eric Hosmer to third base with two outs in the bottom of the tenth, but Salvador P√©rez grounded out, putting a Royals victory on hold. Finnegan again pitched well in the top of the 11th, allowing only one hit and striking out Brandon Moss, who had already hit two home runs. Kansas City's offense produced in the bottom of the 11th a situation identical to that of the tenth; the winning run stood away with two outs, but Jayson Nix struck out to end the inning. Finnegan began the 12th inning by walking Josh Reddick, who advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Jed Lowrie. Finnegan was then relieved by Jason Frasor. Pinch-hitter Alberto Callaspo of Oakland took a wild pitch from Frasor, allowing Reddick to go to third base. Callaspo then hit a line drive to left field, scoring Reddick. The new pitcher Frasor quickly stopped the bleeding by retiring Derek Norris and Nick Punto, but the Athletics had retaken the lead, 8‚Äì7. Lorenzo Cain failed to get the bottom of the 12th off to a promising start for Kansas City when he grounded out. The Oakland Athletics were two outs away from advancing to the ALDS. However, Hosmer nursed a lengthy at-bat into a deep hit off the left field wall that was poorly fielded, allowing him to reach third base. Christian Colon then managed an infield single to tie the game again, scoring Hosmer. Oakland pitcher Dan Otero was replaced by Fernando Abad, who threw to only one batter, Gordon, who popped out. Abad was then relieved by Jason Hammel. Christian Colon, still on first base, stole second (the 7th steal of the game for the Royals) with P√©rez at the plate, after a pitchout was dropped by Derek Norris. P√©rez (who was 0-for-5 at this point) then singled down the line to left field, which narrowly missed the outstretched glove of Josh Donaldson, scoring Colon and ending the marathon game with a Royals victory and a ticket to the ALDS against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Aftermath Kansas City would run the table on their way to the AL pennant, sweeping Los Angeles in three games of a five-game series and the Baltimore Orioles in four games of a seven-game series before losing in seven games to the San Francisco Giants in the 2014 World Series. This victory would be the first of four extra-inning victories for the Royals in the 2014 Postseason. After the game, many Royals fans considered it \\"The Best Game Ever\\" in their franchise history because of the incredible 4-run comeback by Kansas City. Making it sweeter for Royals fans was their bitter feelings towards the Athletics, who played in Kansas City from 1955-67 before owner Charles O. Finley moved the franchise to California. It was the Royals' first playoff game in 29 years.

Partizani B won the game and celebrated promotion to the First Division, but Sopoti Librazhd filed a complaint to the Albanian Football Association arguing that Patizani B had mainly used players from the Partizani first team, including Labinot Ibrahimi and Ylber Ramadani who had featured in the first team against Teuta Durr√´s the day before. The Albanian FA decided to revoke Partizani B's promotion as they awarded the game to Sopoti Librazhd 3‚Äì0 due to Partizani B having broken the rules by featuring Ibrahimi and Ramadani, as a player is not allowed to feature for both the first and reserve team of any club within 24 hours.Vendimi i Komisionit te Disiplines se FSHF date 06.07.2016 However, due to stricter licensing measured enforced by the Albanian FA, First Division side Adriatiku Mamurras failed to meet the conditions to remain in the league and their place was given to Partizani B who were able to meet the necessary criteria, making them the only reserve team to have competed in the second tier of modern Albanian football.Partizani B n√´ Kategorin√´ e Par√´, ja dy grupet e skuadrave Current squadHonours *Albanian Third Division **2012‚Äì13Nj√´ tjet√´r Partizan n√´ t√´ Dyt√´n Debutime historike dhe ekipe amatore, ja t√´ ve√ßantat e kampionatit Staff *President: Gazment Demi *Manager: Marko Pelinxhi *Assistant manager:Shahin Berberi *Academy director: Genc Tomori *Under 17s manager: Nikolin √áo√ßlli *Under 12s manager: Evis √áelmeta *Head scout: Ilir BushatiJa si do ringrem√´ akademin√´ References Category:Football clubs in Albania Category:Association football clubs established in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Albania Category:Football clubs in Tirana B Team ","title":"FK Partizani Tirana B"},{"id":"41887423","text":"KYCT may refer to: * KYCT (FM), a radio station (92.7 FM) licensed to serve Shasta Lake, California, United States * KTTE, a defunct radio station (90.1 FM) formerly licensed to serve Humboldt, Nebraska, United States, which held the call sign KYCT in 2014 * KKLB (FM), a radio station (91.3 FM) licensed to serve Ruidoso, New Mexico, United States, which held the call sign KYCT from 2006 to 2013 ","title":"KYCT"},{"id":"41887425","text":"Crooke's Castle is an ornamental tower in Aghavrin townland, north-west of Coachford village, County Cork, Republic of Ireland. It was built by Thomas Epinetus Crooke of nearby Aghavrin House, who served during the Napoleonic Wars, mainly on board HMS Shamrock, a Royal Navy blockade ship. It is referred to as a 'tower' located on Carrigaknubber Rock as per the 1842 surveyed OS map and named as 'Aghavrin Castle' in both the Ordnance Survey (OS) name book (c. 1840) and the 1901 surveyed OS map. The OS name book describes it as in the southern part of Aghavrin about north-east of the boundary with Rockgrove (townland). Locally, it is nowadays referred to as 'Crooke's Castle.' Early Irish ordnance survey maps indicate structures named 'tower' often located in or around a country-house demesne. These were mostly built in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, and sited in prominent positions to act as 'eye-catchers', and to afford good views from the tower itself. Many were used for tea parties, when tea drinking became fashionable in the eighteenth century. Lewis in A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) describes the demesne of Ahavrin as small but well planted, and refers to 'an isolated rock at its southern extremity' upon which 'stands a picturesque castellated tower, surmounted by a light and graceful turret'. The OS name book describes it as a tower or turret, built by Captain Crooke on Carrigacnubber rock, generally known as 'Ahavrin Castle', and referred to by Herbert Gilman as the 'Admiral's Folly'. The Archaeological Inventory of county Cork describes it as a ruined square three-storey tower (2m x 2m), having rectangular window opes with hood-mouldings, and an embattled parapet. It is also described as having a slim circular projection on the south-east corner with slit windows, rising higher than the tower, and also having an embattled parapet. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 states that it was erected 100 to 120 years previously, cost ¬£100, and was built by Commodore Crooke of the British Navy. The survey holds that 'Crook's Tower' would be a more accurate description, and that it consisted of two narrow sections with the cylindrical portion slightly higher than the rectangular element. It was observed to stand on a high rock in a reasonably level country area, and a distinctive landmark from the road. It was partly ruinous but the circular staircase could still be negotiated. The tower is not accessible to the public and is located on private property. A short distance to the south-west and of presumed earlier date is a mass rock, which would have been used for worship during penal times.

The ideology generally rejects Whig historiography‚Äîthe concept that history shows an inevitable progression towards greater liberty and enlightenment, culminating in liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy‚Äîin favor of a return to traditional societal constructs and forms of government, including absolute monarchism and other archaic forms of leadership such as cameralism. In 2007 and 2008, Curtis Yarvin, writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, articulated what would develop into Dark Enlightenment thinking. Yarvin's theories were elaborated and expanded by Nick Land, who first coined the term Dark Enlightenment in his essay of the same name. The term Dark Enlightenment refers to the Age of Enlightenment, in a pejorative sense. In July 2010, Arnold Kling, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, coined the term \\"neo- reactionaries\\" to describe Yarvin and his followers.  Overview  Neo- reactionaries are an informal community of bloggers and political theorists who have been active since the 2000s. Steve Sailer and Hans-Hermann Hoppe are contemporary forerunners of the ideology, which also draws influence from philosophers such as Thomas Carlyle and Julius Evola. Central to Land's ideas is a belief in freedom's incompatibility with democracy. Land drew inspiration from libertarians such as Peter Thiel, as indicated in his essay The Dark Enlightenment. The Dark Enlightenment has been described by journalists and commentators as alt-right and neo-fascist. A 2016 article in New York magazine notes that \\"Neoreaction has a number of different strains, but perhaps the most important is a form of post-libertarian futurism that, realizing that libertarians aren't likely to win any elections, argues against democracy in favor of authoritarian forms of government.\\" Neo-reactionaries sometimes decline to speak to reporters. When approached by The Atlantic political affairs reporter Rosie Gray, Yarvin attempted to troll her on Twitter, and blogger Nick B. Steves said that her IQ was inadequate to the task of interviewing him.  Criticism  Journalist Andrew Sullivan notes that neoreaction's pessimistic appraisal of democracy dismisses many advances that have been made and that global manufacturing patterns also limit the economic independence that sovereign states can have from one another. In an article for The Sociological Review, after an examination of neoreaction's core tenets, Roger Burrows deplores the ideology as \\"hyper-neoliberal, technologically deterministic, anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian, pro- eugenicist, racist and, likely, fascist\\", and ridicules the entire accelerationist framework as a faulty attempt at \\"mainstreaming...misogynist, racist and fascist discourses.\\" Moreover, he criticizes neoreaction's racial principles for their brazen \\"disavowal of any discourses\\" advocating for socio-economic equality and, accordingly, considers it a \\"eugenic philosophy\\" in favor of what Land deems 'hyper-racism'.  Relation to the alt-right  Some consider the Dark Enlightenment part of the alt-right, representing its theoretical branch. The Dark Enlightenment has been labelled by some as neo- fascist and \\"an acceleration of capitalism to a fascist point\\". Land disputes this, claiming that \\"fascism is a mass anti-capitalist movement\\". Journalist and pundit James Kirchick states that \\"although neo-reactionary thinkers disdain the masses and claim to despise populism and people more generally, what ties them to the rest of the alt-right is their unapologetically racist element, their shared misanthropy and their resentment of mismanagement by the ruling elites.\\" Scholar Andrew Jones, in his article From NeoReactionary Theory to the Alt-Right, postulates that the Dark Enlightenment (i.e. the NeoReactionary Movement) is \\"key to understanding the Alt-Right\\" political ideology.Jones, Andrew. From NeoReactionary Theory to the Alt-Right. London, UK: Palgrave Macmillan. \\"The use of affect theory, postmodern critiques of modernity, and a fixation on critiquing regimes of truth,\\" Jones remarks, \\"are fundamental to NeoReaction (NRx) and what separates it from other Far-Right theory\\". Moreover, Jones argues that Dark Enlightenment's fixation on aesthetics, history, and philosophy, as opposed to the traditional empirical approach, distinguishes it from related far-right ideologies. Historian Joe Mulhall, writing for The Guardian in his 2020 article, \\"Andrew Sabisky‚Äôs job at No 10 shows how mainstream the alt-right has become\\", questions the ethicality of Nick Land's stance on \\"gender, race, religion, [and] governance\\" and, consequentially, regards the philosopher's neoreactionist manifesto, The Dark Enlightenment, to be a means of \\"propagating very far-right ideas.\\" Despite neoreaction's limited online audience, Mulhall considers the ideology to be a \\"key and constituent part\\" in the realm of \\"extreme far-right\\" socio- political beliefs, a microcosm of broader right-wing movements.

It operated from 1992 to 1995 before closing due to financial difficulties. Development=Funding The total start-up cost for the project was more than ¬£4.5 million in Irish pounds (approximately ‚Ç¨5.7 million). With building costs of between ¬£90 and ¬£110 per square foot, it was reputed to be the most expensive construction project in Ireland. Tramore F√°ilte, an arm of the South East Regional Tourism Organisation, provided ¬£737,000 toward start-up costs, in addition to term loans and leasing arrangements of approximately ¬£575,000. The project also attracted a European Union Structure Fund Grant of ¬£1.81 million.https://www.jstor.org/stable/20557306 Private sector investment of ¬£1.5 million was provided by Vectravision, Kentz, and British firm International Tourism Projects Ltd. Bank loans provided a further ¬£600,000 of capital. A further ¬£230,000-¬£250,000 was funded by 63 Business Expansion Scheme (BES) investors, which included employees of the Bank of Ireland, Kentz, and Tramore F√°ilte. There were 67 investors in total.https://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0424/869888-celtworld-to-become- dinosaur-park/ The 2.5 acre site was purchased from Tramore F√°ilte for ¬£400,000. The company was incorporated as Celtworld Limited on 30 November 1990, opening in May 1992 with 15 full-time and 15 part-time employees. Design The Art Deco interior was designed by artist Jim Fitzpatrick. The building was planned as a wet-weather attraction. It was clad with aluminium and was not air conditioned, which led to uncomfortable conditions in warm weather. Features=Theatre Celtworld's main feature was a 25-minute show which involved a revolving auditorium, the largest such theatre in Europe at that time. Visual effects included animated artwork, computer-generated imagery, lasers, holograms, and animatronics. The theatre was presented as a \\"Crystal Time Chamber\\" which allowed visitors to travel back to Celtic times. Every turn of the revolving theatre brought visitors to 1 of 6 presentations, which involved a range of mythical and legendary characters such as a daughter of Noah, Tuatha D√© Danann, Fomorians, Parthol√≥n, Lugh, Balor, and C√∫ Chulainn. The experience was narrated by Tuan mac Cairill.

Closure Celtworld experienced early trading difficulties and a financial consultant was appointed to review the company. 270,000 people were expected to attend each year but the project attracted less than 50% of its target.https://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0424/869888-celtworld-to-become- dinosaur-park/ It received a loan from Bord F√°ilte in late 1993 but business did not improve. Celtworld closed in September 1995 with losses of over ¬£4 million. More than ¬£2 million had been spent on set-up, promotion, and consultancy fees. The centre's failure has been attributed in part to its unchanging audiovisual presentations, which failed to attract adequate repeat visitors.http://doras.dcu.ie/17424/1/t.m._breathnach_20120702154402.pdf Bord F√°ilte Director General Matt McNulty claimed that the project's failure was due to its design as a wet-weather facility. Its opening season saw unseasonably warm, dry weather which led to low attendance. Its failure led to discussion in D√°il √âireann, the Irish parliament, where Kathleen Lynch questioned the then Minister for Tourism and Trade, Enda Kenny about its closure. Bobby Molloy also questioned Kenny over the closure and allegations which had been made on the RT√â One current affairs television shows Prime Time and Marketplace. Aftermath The property was placed on the market with the condition that it could only be used for tourism or leisure activities, which limited its potential sale price. The site went on sale in September 1995 at an asking price of ¬£600,000 and was sold to a Northern Ireland consortium in January 1996 for ¬£475,000. In 1997, the site was sold to Butlin's Mosney owner Phelim McCloskey for ¬£380,000.https://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0424/869888-celtworld-to-become- dinosaur-park/ McCloskey developed a robotic dinosaurs exhibit which closed after less than a year. A European Commission investigation was due to report in 1997 but as of 1999 had not been completed. In 1999, McCloskey obtained planning permission for 30 short-term holiday apartments on the site. Permission was granted by An Bord Plean√°la, controversially over-ruling a Waterford County Council decision to reject an original proposal for 36 apartments. In 2000, Ambient Catering Limited purchased the site and developed a 20,000 square feet music venue named South with a capacity of 2,200 guests, at a cost of ‚Ç¨3 million. The venue opened in 2001 but closed soon afterwards. Celtworld Limited was dissolved on 15 July 2005. The site was sold in May 2006 to Volute Properties Limited, who received planning permission for a mixed-use development with Dunnes Stores as anchor tenants. This proposal fell through and the building was demolished in 2008. By 2020, it had been redeveloped as an Aldi supermarket.https://waterford-news.ie/2020/05/15/remembering- celtworld-and-south/#.XvFL5WpKgWohttps://www.wlrfm.com/2018/11/21/aldi- receives-planning-permission-to-build-new-store-in-tramore/ Media and popular culture Celtworld was featured in the 1994 RT√â Television short drama, Gypsies.

The onus is on the complainant to establish that an agency's action both breached a privacy principle and caused harm.Privacy Act 1993, s 66(1) in New Zealand Law Commission Review of the Privacy Act 1993: Review of the Law of Privacy Stage 4 at [6.3]. Harm can include financial loss, adverse effect on rights or interests, or a significant injury to feelings. Breaches of principles 6 and 7, the refusal to grant access to or allow correction of information, need not establish harm as these situations are considered interferences per se.Privacy Act 1993, s 66(2) in New Zealand Law Commission Review of the Privacy Act 1993: Review of the Law of Privacy Stage 4 at [6.3]. The Commissioner can decide to take no action based on issues of time, triviality, bad faith, or if another course of action is more appropriate. Should the Commissioner decide to pursue a complaint, his role is both investigatory and conciliatory. With this mediation rather than litigation focus, the Commissioner can call \\"compulsory mediation conferences,\\" and seek a resolution agreement and assurance of non-recurrence.Ursula Cheer and John Burrows Media Law in New Zealand at 375.

The majority of complaints involved a breach of the IPPs, ahead of the Health Information Privacy Code.Privacy Commissioner's Annual Report 2013 ‚Äì A Year of Rapid Change at 24. The actions of government agencies, including education providers and local authorities, trigger most complaints, followed by health sector agencies.

He hired Orland Emile White, a staff member at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, to assist with collection and handling of plant specimens. The expedition was financed by the H. K. Mulford Company, a pharmaceutical company. Its mission was to explore the Amazon Valley from the headwaters of the Quime River in Bolivia to the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil. The expedition left La Paz, Bolivia, in July 1921. Rusby was forced to leave the expedition due to neuritis, an infected tooth, and his age; however, White and Mart√≠n C√°rdenas continued to collect. The expedition lasted eight months, but never reached the Amazon. Expedition News from 1921: The expedition leaves the field in March 1922:  Results  The botanists returned with over 2,400 collections representing more than 1,500 species of plant life. Their collections included a large amount of orchids, termites, economic plants and seeds. Rusby worked through most of the samples himself identifying six new genera and 257 new species.

He discovered several new species of plants and played a significant role in founding the New York Botanical Garden and developing research and exploration programs at the institution. He helped to establish the field of economic botany, and left a collection of research and published works in botany and pharmacology. He joined a series of expeditions from 1880 and 1921 and in 1921, he led the Mulford Expedition to the Amazon. Biography Henry H. Rusby grew up in Franklin (today Nutley) New Jersey. He showed a passionate interest in plants. At 21, his herbarium won first prize at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. He came to meet Dr. George Thurber who was President of the Torrey Botanical Club. Rusby joined the club in 1879, and by then studied medicine at the School of Medicine of New York University. In 1880, still a medical student, he spent 18 months collecting plants in Texas and New Mexico for the Smithsonian Institution. In 1883 he returned to the southwest to study and collect medicinal flora of Arizona, for Parke-Davis & Co. In 1884, he graduated with his degree in medicine, and in the following year he embarked on a two-year expedition for Parke, Davis & Co., crossing South America and exploring remote regions of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Brazil. Although trained as a physician, Rusby chose to leave medicine for his interest in plants. In 1889, he became Professor of Botany and Materia Medica at the School of Pharmacy at Columbia University. He was Dean of the Faculty for 26 years until his retirement in 1930, and Dean Emeritus until his death in 1940. His association with New York Botanical Garden began even before the garden was formally created. As a member of Torrey Botanical Club, he encountered the celebrated botanist and taxonomist Nathaniel Lord Britton. Establishing a botanical garden was a goal for the Torrey Botanical Club. In 1888 a pro-Garden committee of Botany, with eight distinguished members of the club, including Britton and Rusby was formed. Rusby was instrumental in collaboration between the Herbarium School of Columbia, and the botanical Library at the New York Botanical Garden. On January 26, 1898, Rusby was designated the \\"Honorary Curator of the Museum of Economic Botany. His tropical explorations, particularly in the Amazon, provided materials for taxonomic studies and economic botany by the New York Botanical Garden. Productivity in these explorations was due to his strength and exploration skills. In 1921, at age 65, he made his last trip to South America as Director of the \\"Mulford Biological Exploration of the Amazon Basin\\". Rusby died on November 18, 1940, aged 85.

This was the last major fleet problem conducted before America's involvement in World War II. World War II *April 1942: VB-3, embarked on , provided escort patrols for the task force which launched the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo. *4 Jun 1942: At the Battle of Midway, VB-3, embarked on , engaged in its first combat operations. Yorktown's first strike included 17 SBD-3's from VB-3 led by Lieutenant Commander M. F. Leslie. Approximately an hour after launch, VB-3's aircraft sighted the Japanese Fleet and commenced their dive- bombing attack; the primary target was the carrier S≈çry≈´. Lieutenant (jg) Paul A. Holmberg was the first to drop his 1,000 pounder on the S≈çry≈´. His hit was followed by two more from VB-3's SBDs. S≈çry≈´ erupted into flames and eventually sank. With the S≈çry≈´ in flames, the other VB-3 SBDs directed their attack against other targets. They attacked a destroyer, the Isokaze, making one hit on her fantail and ‚Äúwhat appeared to be a battleship,‚Äù claiming a hit on her stern. All 17 SBDs from VB-3 escaped the attack without a hit and returned to the Yorktown. Prior to landing on the carrier, they were directed to leave the area due to incoming enemy aircraft. All VB-3‚Äôs SBDs landed on Enterprise except for Lieutenant Commander Leslie and his wingman, Lieutenant (jg) Holmberg. These two men, low on fuel, ditched their aircraft alongside the and were picked up by the ship‚Äôs motor whaleboat. The battle was still not over for VB-3. In late afternoon, 14 of VB-3‚Äôs SBDs were launched from Enterprise as part of a strike group ordered to attack the fourth carrier Hiry≈´. Lieutenant Shumway was in charge of VB-3‚Äôs formation. The strike force located Hiry≈´ and again caught a Japanese carrier in the vulnerable position of having armed and fueled planes on deck. Direct hits from Shumway‚Äôs SBD‚Äôs resulted in a torched Hiry≈´ and her eventual sinking. Several of VB-3‚Äôs aircraft suffered heavy damage from attacking Japanese aircraft. However, all but two of VB-3‚Äôs aircraft returned to Enterprise. Seventeen of VB-3‚Äôs pilots received the Navy Cross for their action during the Battle of Midway, they were Ensigns Benson, Butler, Campbell, Cobb, Cooner, Elder, Hanson, Isaman, Lane, Merrill and Schoegel; Lieutenant (jg)s Holmberg, Sherwood and Wiseman; Lieutenants Bottomley and Shumway; and Lieutenant Commander Leslie. *August 1942: While operating from in the South Pacific, the squadron participated in strikes against Guadalcanal and other enemy installations in the Solomon Islands in support of the Guadalcanal Campaign. *24 August 1942: VB-3 participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, attacking the Japanese light carrierRy≈´j≈ç, and helping to sink her. Jan‚ÄìJul 1943: VB-3 operated in the South Pacific flying combat sorties against various Japanese-held islands and providing air cover for American forces. *July 1943: VB-3 and the Saratoga Air Group were relieved by Air Group 12 and boarded for transfer to CONUS to reform, arriving at San Diego on 18 August. This ended the air group and VB-3‚Äôs association with Saratoga. *November 1944: VB-3 conducted combat operations from against various targets, including shipping, in support of the Leyte invasion. *January 1945: Combat operations were conducted against targets in Formosa and the Philippines in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf.

Biography  Beloch was the daughter of the German historian Karl Julius Beloch, who taught ancient history for 50 years at Sapienza University of Rome, and American Bella Bailey. Beloch studied mathematics at the Sapienza University of Rome and wrote her undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Guido Castelnuovo. She received her degree in 1908 with Lauude and \\"dignita' di stampa\\" which means that her work was worthy of publication and in fact her thesis \\"Sulle trasformazioni birazionali nello spazio\\" (On Birational Transformations In Space) was published in the Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata.Review of the journal version of \\"Sulle trasformazioni birazionali nello spazio\\": Emile Lampe, (in German) Guido Castelnuovo was very impressed with her talent and offer her the position of assistant which Margherita took and held until 1919, when she moved to Pavia and the successive year to Palermo to work under Michele De Franchis, an important figure of the Italian school of algebraic geometry at the time. In 1924, Beloch completed her \\"libera docenza\\" (a degree that at that time had to be obtained before one could become a professor) and three years later she became a full professor at the University of Ferrara where she taught until her retirement (1955).  Scientific work  Her main scientific interests were in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and photogrammetry. After her thesis, she worked on classification of algebraic surfaces studying the configurations of lines that could lie on surfaces. The next step was to study rational curves lying on surfaces and in this framework Beloch obtained the following important result:E. Strickland, Scienziate d'Italia: diciannove vite per la ricerca. \\"Hyperelliptic surfaces of rank 2 are characterised by having 16 rational curves.\\" Beloch also made some contributions to the theory of skew algebraic curves.M.

It is located within Yellowhead County in west- central Alberta, Canada.  Geography  The Coal Branch region encompasses a portion of the eastern slopes and foothills of the Canadian Rockies east of Jasper National Park. It extends from Alberta Highway 16 in the north to the Brazeau River in the south. The McLeod, Lovett and Embarras Rivers flow through it, and it includes many former coal-mining towns and ghost towns.  History  The Coal Branch rail line was built between 1911 and 1912 by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway to gain access to deposits of high-quality steam coal. It diverges from the main line at Bickerdike and runs south through Coalspur to the Lovett River, a distance of . A series of coal mining, railroad, and logging towns quickly developed along the route. Going south from Bickerdike, they include McLeod River, Erith, Weald, Embarras, Robb, Coalspur, Diss, Sterco, Foothills and Lovetteville. A western branch that opened in the summer of 1913 diverges at Coalspur and extends to Mountain Park. Along that route lie Mercoal, Shaw, Leyland, Cadomin, and Mountain Park. In 1921 a spur long was built to Luscar. The Coal Branch towns thrived from the arrival of the railroad until markets for steam coal declined as the railroads replaced steam locomotives with diesel. Most of the mines closed during the 1950s, after which the population quickly declined and many of the towns were abandoned. Today the permanent population of the area is small, but the scenic mountain setting makes the Coal Branch area a popular destination for all types of outdoor recreation. Coal mining continues near Luscar, producing coking coal for export to Asian steel mills, but most of the workforce lives to the north in Edson and Hinton.

Anchorages are where anchors are lowered and utilised, whereas moorings usually are tethering to buoys or something similar. The locations usually have conditions for safe anchorage in protection from weather conditions, and other hazards. The purpose of resting a ship at sea securely can be for waiting to enter ports, as well as taking on cargo or passengers where insufficient port facilities exist. Some coastlines without port facilities have extensive anchorage locations. In the days of large-scale sailing ship operations, a ship could wait at an anchorage for the wind to change, allowing it to continue its journey.

Starting about the year 1600, it was decorated by an impressive series of pupils of Ludovico Carracci, among them some of the titans of early Italian Baroque painting: Francesco Albani, Francesco Brizio, Domenichino, Lorenzo Garbieri, Lucio Massari, Guido Reni, and Baldassare Aloisi (il Balanino). The frescoes include scenes from the Passion and Resurrection of Christ. Among the paintings listed by Malvasia in the Oratory are:Handbook for Travellers in Central Italy: 1 Southern Tuscany and Papal States, John Murray, 1857, page 50.Pitture scolture ed architetture delle chiese luoghi pubblici, palazzi, e case, by Carlo Cesare Malvasia, 1792, page 82-84. *Last Judgement (outside portico) by Pietro Pancotto *St Francis with angels above and demons below (right wall) by Antonio Caracci *Virgin and Child with Joseph gathering dates by Leonello Spada *Sibyl (above side door) by Garbieri *Coronation of St Catherine also by Garbieri *St Marta conversing with the Savior before whom the Magdalen is kneeling (vault) by Massari *Sibyl (over door) and Angel bearing the palm of martyrdom to St Ursula also by Massari *Infant Jesus playing with St. John in the presence of little angels by Paolo Caracci In the upper oratory, the frescoes include a St Peter going out weeping from Pilate‚Äôs house by Francesco Albani.

BNT was founded by Joe Douglass in 1996 to allow student playwrights the opportunity to see their work produced, and give student actors and directors the opportunity to shape a show in collaboration with its writer. BNT prioritizes the inclusion of undergraduate students from outside the USC School of Dramatic Arts, and USC students from widely disparate majors and departments have participated as actors, writers, directors, and producers for BNT shows. The organization's name draws from the fact that it only produces original work; every show is brand new. One-Act Plays The productions for which they are best-known, BNT produces a series of one-acts every semester. The organization curates submissions from throughout the student body, and a reading committee made up of BNT executives and student volunteers read every show and collectively select the one-acts that will together produce the strongest show; typically four are chosen. At this point, the playwrights participate in a writing workshop to finalize their scripts, and often remain involved in the drafting and production process in collaboration with their show's director and cast. Full-Length Show In 2012, BNT produced its first full-length student-written show, and has continued to do so every Spring. The process is similar to that of the one-acts: submissions are called for, and a reading committee selects a single show to be produced. List of BNT Full-Length Productions *2012: Here's The Thing by Jake Minton *2013: Get. That. Snitch. by Achilles Capone *2014: Animal Stories by Molly Sharpe *2015: The Adventurers Club by Kyle Bellar *2016: Stars & Shadows by Jonathan Stoller-Schoff *2017: This Our Now by Olivia Cordell 24-Hour Festival BNT also sponsors a 24-hour theater festival every spring. From 10 pm to 10 am, individuals and teams work together to produce the script for a show or a series of shows based on a prompt. Then, from 10 am to 10 pm, the script is passed off to actors and producers, who memorize lines, block the show, acquire necessary props, costumes, and sets, and rehearse the show. At 10 pm, the curtain goes up, exactly one day after the show was first conceived. Writers' Workshop In 2014, BNT will expand its one-acts writers workshop into an open forum that meets regularly, as a resource for student playwrights throughout USC to offer feedback and help to one another on scripts they're drafting. The workshop meets twice a month, and is not officially associated with the selection process for BNT's productions that year.

It originally aired on April 15, 2010. The episode was written by Barbie Kligman and Andrew Chambliss and directed by David Von Ancken. Plot Stefan (Paul Wesley) tries to detox himself from human blood by working out and staying away from other people. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) does not find the idea really good and he tempts him with a glass of blood before he drinks it himself. Stefan has his reasons for not wanting to drink human blood. At the Gilbert house, uncle John (David Anders) shows up for a visit; he doesn't know how long it will be. Jenna (Sara Canning) is not really happy to see him. John does not state all of the reasons why he came back, but one of them is to prevent Jenna from selling his brother's office to Pearl (Kelly Hu). At school, Matt (Zach Roerig) thanks Elena (Nina Dobrev) for being there for him while Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) and Tyler (Michael Trevino) talk about Vicky. Jeremy is not convinced that Vicky's death was due to overdose as was stated on the coroner's report, and he later asks the Sheriff (Marguerite MacIntyre) if they have any news about Vicky since somebody must have buried her. The founders' council calls a meeting in which Damon is now a member. Elena's uncle John is also there and a member and warns the council that there were many break-ins at a blood bank not far away from Mystic Falls, meaning that the vampire problem is not over yet. Alaric (Matt Davis) talks to Elena about Jeremy's last history paper that was based on vampires. He says that Jeremy made it clear it was not real but maybe she should talk to him. Elena asks Stefan about it and Stefan suggests that she should ask him and also talk to him about her being adopted. They start making out but Stefan cannot control his desire for blood and he throws himself off of Elena. Elena really worries about him and she calls Damon to ask how Stefan is dealing with the whole thing and how long it will take for him to be himself again. Elena decides to tell Jeremy about her adoption, something that Jeremy takes really well. While they are talking, she brings up Jeremy's paper about vampires and Jeremy says that it is just another thing in a long list of the crazy Gilbert men, convincing Elena that he doesn't know the truth about vampires. Everyone is gathered at the Founder's Day 150th Anniversary party. Stefan struggles to control his hunger and starts drinking. Elena notices that he is drunk and worries even more about him after an aggressive behavior to one of the attendants of the party while Damon is amused seeing him having fun. Damon is more concerned about Jeremy who is asking around more about Vicky's suspicious death. He wants to compel him but Elena tells him not to do it and that she will handle it herself. Tyler runs into Kelly (Melinda Clarke) and the two of them go outside and, both being a little drunk, start making out. Matt gets out and attacks Tyler. The two of them start fighting and Kelly gets injured after they push her away. Alaric goes outside and breaks them up, seeing something strange in Tyler's face. In the meantime, John introduces himself to Damon and the two of them have a talk about the history of Mystic Fall's vampire problem since 1864. John seems to know more than Damon thinks since he knows about the vampires that were locked in the tomb and that Damon was the one who opened it few days ago. Damon realizes that John knows he is a vampire and he kills him. Elena tries to talk to Jeremy and convince him to move on from Vicky. From their conversation, Jeremy suspects that Elena knows something and she hides it from him. He leaves the party and goes home where he starts searching for her journal. He finds it and starts reading. Back at the party, Stefan smells blood while heading out of the house. He searches around and finds Kelly, who got injured during Tyler and Matt's fight. Stefan goes to her and while she is talking to him, he wipes the blood with his fingers and when Kelly asks him what is he doing, he runs outside to collect himself but his hunger takes over and he licks the blood from his fingers. Inside, Damon enjoys the party again but he is shocked seeing John across the room alive and well. Mayor Lockwood (Robert Pralgo) invites John to ring the charter bell in honor of the 150th Anniversary. Damon heads to Alaric and whispers to him that John has the same ring as his and wonders if Isobel was also involved with John since she was the one who gave the ring to Alaric. Damon and Alaric follow John outside while he is heading home to ask him about the ring. John reveals that he knows much more about them and everyone in Mystic Falls than everyone suspects and he will tell everyone if anything happens to him. He says that the ring is a family heirloom and that his brother also had one. He gave one of them to Isobel and Isobel gave it to Alaric. John also tells Damon that he was the one who sent Isobel to him and that he knows about Katherine before he takes off, leaving the two men stunned looking at each other. Elena comes back home where Jeremy acts like he did not just read her journal. She goes to her room and finds Stefan who came to apologize to her for his earlier behavior. He finally admits to her that he cannot control himself and wants to stay away from her so he will not hurt her, but Elena tells him that she is not scared and she will be there for him. Stefan returns home to find Damon drinking blood from a glass and really worried after John's revelations. Before Damon tells him anything, he realizes how much Stefan is struggling and he leaves the room, leaving the glass of blood on the table. Stefan takes the glass and drinks the blood.

Ranamagar took a deep interest in the welfare of prisoners and their families from an early age, and after becoming well acquainted with their struggles through various social projects, she founded Prisoner's Assistance Nepal in 2000. Her continued work through the organization has led to the opening of four children's homes, two schools, and various other social projects aimed at helping prisoners and their children. She was one of three finalist nominees for the 2014 World's Children's Prize, and on October 22, 2014 was awarded the World's Children's Honorary Award by Queen Silvia of Sweden. Early life and career Born into poverty in rural Nepal, Ranamagar was unable to attend school like her brothers and instead learned to read and write by practicing letters with a stick on the dust in her yard. After studying as much as she could from her siblings' school books, she was finally permitted to attend school and graduated at the top of her class from the local school. After her graduation, Ranamagar became a teacher and eventually moved to Kathmandu. As a young adult, she became interested with the work of Bishnu Kumari Waiba, or Parijat, a famed Nepali writer and social advocate who among other endeavors, fought for the rights of political prisoners in Nepal. Ranamagar joined Parijat's movement for prisoners rights and became well acquainted with the justice system in Nepal and the dismal conditions in its prisons. After Parijat's death in 1993, Ranamagar continued to visit prisons and provide basic necessities for prisoners, shifting her focus from political prisoners to impoverished and disadvantaged individuals often wrongfully imprisoned for petty crimes committed out of desperation. Work with Prisoners Assistance Nepal As a result of her continued work with prisoners, Ranamagar founded Prisoners Assistance Nepal in 2000 to provide help to prisoners in jail, after their release, and to their family members. Since its genesis, Ranamagar has grown the organization to care for over three hundred children rescued from prisons in addition to providing services to prisoners in over seventy jails across the country. In recognition of this work, the BBC listed her as one of their 100 Women during 2017.

The largest concentration of Bosnians in Chicago lives on the North Side. History The first Bosnians settled in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, joining other immigrants seeking better opportunities and better lives. As the former Yugoslavia continued to find its identity as a nation over the last century, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina sought stability and new beginnings in the city of Chicago, with many intending to return to their homeland. The Bosnian Muslim community received a new influx of migrants after World War II who were displaced by the war and Communist takeover. As the population increased in the early 1950s, the community invited Sheik Kamil Avdich to become the first permanent imam (religious minister). Under Imam Kamil's leadership, the Muslim Religious and Cultural Home was established to raise funds for a mosque, which opened on Halsted Street in 1957. In 1968, the organization's name was changed to the Bosnian American Cultural Association, and in the early 1970s it purchased land in Northbrook to build a larger mosque and cultural center. The Islamic Cultural Center of Greater Chicago has remained an important center for Muslim religious activity, serving Bosnian and non-Bosnian Muslims in the Chicago metropolitan area. Demographics Approximately 40,000 Bosnians came as refugees from the Bosnian War during the 1990s and early 2000s. Religion Bosnian immigrants during the early 1900s established the first mosque in the city. Bosnian Muslims were early leaders in the establishment of Chicago's Muslim community. In 1906, they established Dzemijetul Hajrije (The Benevolent Society) of Illinois to preserve the community's religious and national traditions as well as to provide mutual assistance for funerals and illness. The organization established chapters in Gary, Indiana, in 1913, and Butte, Montana, in 1916, and is the oldest existing Muslim organization in the United States.

Nagendranath Basu (date unknown).  Early life  Nagendranath was born in the village of Mahesh located in Hooghly district, West Bengal. He was the great-grandson of Tarini, sister of Ashutosh Deb.  Career = Archaeology and collector  Nagendranath was an official surveyor of Orissa government in Mayurbhanj district, and traveled widely to examine archaeological remnants, compiling numerous sculptures, coins and inscriptions. Most of these expeditions were self-funded and the collections were donated to Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. He had also obtained a huge collection of ancient manuscripts (puthi) in Bengali, Sanskrit and Oriya, mostly from street-vendors and facilitated University of Calcutta to initiate its library in the Bengali Department.  Literature  Basu started his literary career with poems and novels, but soon became extensively involved in editing. = Editor  Journals  Basu edited multiple journals‚Äîthe vernacular monthlies of Tapasvini and Bharat, Sahitya Parisad Patrika, the mouthpiece of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad and Kayastha, the publication of the Kayastha Sabha (which he had founded).  Books and Texts  He also served as the editor of multiple contemporary Bengali authors and published numerous Middle Bengali classics‚ÄîChaitanya Mangala by Jayananda, Krishna Prema Tarangini by Raghunath Bhagavat Acharya, Kashi-Parikrama et al‚Äîvia Bangiya Sahitya Parishad.Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis, Kunal Chakrabarti, Shubhra Chakrabarti, Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 83 Nagendranath was also nominated to the Textbook Committee. = Author = In 1884, he published Shabdendu Mahakosh, an English-Bangla dictionary and in the process came in close contacts with Anandakrishna Basu (a grandson of Raja Radhakanta Deb and Hara Prasad Shastri, who persuaded him to join The Asiatic Society. Nagendranath went on to write multiple scholarly books and essays on Bengali social history and allied historical affairs, in his roles at the society. Bangla Bishwakosh In the late 19th century, Basu gained widespread recognition as the compiler of the Bangla Bishwakosh, one of the most complete encyclopedias in Bangla (at that time). The first volume of Bangla Bishwakosh was compiled by Troilokyanath Mukhopadhyay (and his brother, Rangalal) in 1887; however the all the subsequent volumes were compiled and published by Nagendranath, who held the reins from 1888 till the publication of the 22nd (and last) volume in 1911. A 24 volume translation in Hindi was compiled and published by Nagendranath from 1916 to 1931. A second Hindi edition entered compilation from 1933 onward; however, only four volumes were published before his death and the project remains incomplete. Banger Jatiya Itihasa A multi-volume work, this was based on kulapanjikas‚Äîgenealogical histories of prominent families, and has been since considered as a magnum opus. It was sequentially published from 1911 to 1933. Basu gathered these kulapanjikas from ghataks (matchmakers) across the country, who used to hold high acclaim in the Bengali society as professional genealogists (to the extent of arbitrating disputes of societal status) and effectively served as tools of social memory. The historicity of the source material for his work were rejected in near-entirety by a majority of the contemporary professional historians including Akshay Kumar Maitreya, Ramaprasad Chanda, R. C. Majumdar, R. D. Banerji et al, belonging to the logical-positivist school of thought. Not only the tales were emotionally charged verses with distinct impressions of caste-chauvinism but also they oft-contradicted each other, suffered from dating inaccuracies and failed to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. However Basu and others followed a romantic nativist school and considered them as a treasure trove of indigenous social history, wherein history did not merely mean a linear chronology of dynastic rulers and the state but rather the entirety of local caste-societies (samaja) with its own mythologies, traditions and material achievements, as experienced by the masses and reflected in kulapanjikas. Material from different kulapanjikas were assimilated to form a history of the broader Bengali society.  Other samaja histories  Basu also wrote Uttarrarhiya Kayastha Kanda (1910), a sub-regional history of Uttar Rarh (a geographical region in North Bengal) by integrating the genealogical histories of various local caste-samajs‚ÄîKandi, Jemo, Rashra, Joyjan et al. A volume on the regional history of Burdwan and Kamarupa was also produced in similar manner. Patronage in various forms were provided by local aristocrats, rajahs and zamindars.  Miscellaneous  Basu had authored and edited volumes on the musical heritage of Bengal.  Reception  Basu's historical methods have been challenged. His interpretations are now deemed to be of questionable reliability, courtesy his strong antipathy towards the Muslim rule in India and a rigid acceptance of the-then prevalent caste hierarchy as a social order. His usage of kulapanjika as authentic source(s) has not only introduced aspects of un-reliability but also espoused a Savarna view of the world; outright myths, legends and popular imaginations (esp. about the greatness of the Aryans and a pan-Bengali identity which aligned with Aryan traits) frequently pervade his works. Legacy and Honors He was awarded the title of \\"Raysaheb\\" and \\"Prachyavidyamaharnav\\". On 17 March 1915, Kolkata Municipal Corporation renamed Basu's residential street of 8, Kantapukur Lane to Bishvakosh Lane, in commemoration of his pioneer efforts behind Bangla Bishwakosh.Nagendranath Basu Plate References Category:1866 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Bengali writers Category:University of Calcutta faculty Category:Vangiya Sahitya Parishad Category:19th-century Bengali poets Category:Indian male essayists Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:Bengali male poets Category:19th-century Indian essayists Category:20th-century Indian essayists Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:19th-century Indian poets Category:19th-century male writers Category:20th-century Indian male writers ","title":"Nagendranath Basu"},{"id":"41888324","title":"Jesse Cockney"},{"id":"41888339","text":"Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery of Seville.

Quintero's professional career began with Central FC in his native Trinidad and Tobago, where he made his first-team debut in 2013, at the age of 19. Early life Quintero was born in Blanchisseuse, Trinidad and Tobago and attended El Dorado East Secondary School, where he repeated his final year to improve himself academically prior to pursuing a career in football. Dwight has stated that his aunt, Tamara, was a significant influence on his early football career as she encouraged and provided him with confidence to have higher aspirations. In March 2009, Quintero joined the youth program at local club Joe Public and represented the Eastern Lions for three seasons. In 2011, Quintero led El Dorado East's Blue Thunder in his final season with 12 goals, which included two hat-tricks, and the Secondary Schools Football League (SSFL) East Zone title. After Joe Public withdrew from the TT Pro League following the 2010‚Äì11 season, Dwight made a switch to fellow Pro League club North East Stars in 2012 and played in their reserve team for two years. Club career=Central FC At the age of 19, Quintero signed a two-year contract with Central FC of the TT Pro League in July 2013. Two months later, he scored a 67th-minute goal in his league debut to give the Sharks a win over defending champions Defence Force in the 2013‚Äì14 league opener. In October 2013, Quintero scored in the final of the First Citizens Cup to give Central FC its first major trophy in a 2‚Äì1 win over Defence Force. He scored two more goals in the next three league matches against Police on 25 October and a week later against North East Stars on 1 November. Quintero continued his goal scoring form in November with five goals against National Super League clubs Joe Public and 1.FC Santa Rosa, respectively, during the TOYOTA Classic and FA Trophy competitions. He later scored a first-half equaliser for the Sharks in the FA Trophy final against W Connection on 18 December. However, after the arrival of Willis Plaza the next month, playing time was sparse for the remainder of the season. Quintero finished his first professional season with three league goals and 11 goals in all competitions. International career Quintero has represented Trinidad and Tobago on various levels of international competition, having been capped for the under-17 and under-20 national teams. Youth teams He began his international career for the under-17 team during qualification for the 2011 CONCACAF U-17 Championship, where he made three second-half substitute appearances. In February 2011, during the continental competition, Quintero made his first start for the Soca Warriors against hosts Jamaica. However, after a lackluster first-half performance he was an early second-half substitution. He went on to make late appearances in the team's final two matches against Guatemala and Canada. In August 2012, Quintero made three scoreless starts as a lone striker for the under-20 team during their first round of qualification for the 2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship. However, in November 2012, he made just one appearance for the Soca Warriors, which witnessed the team finish a disappointing bottom in their final qualification group.

Voco Point is one of the busiest coastal trading points in the country and coastal vessels from throughout the country, from Alotau to Manus, from Lihir to Vanimo line up at the wharves. The passenger boats ferry people to Finschhafen, the Siassi islands, Kimbe, Rabaul, New Ireland, Oro Bay, Alotau, Madang, and Wewak. The local Lae villages call the area around Voco Point Asiawi, which according to mythology, used to be a long point that went out much further but was eaten by the evil spirit Yaayaa.  Location  Voco Point is located 1 km east of the main port of Lae and south of the main town on the coast.  Nomenclature  The pre-World War I Vacuum Oil Company, later called Mobil, had a depot at the site of Voco Point. Voco is short for Vacuum Oil Company.  History  The main township of Lae was originally on the flats between Voco Point and the airfield. The site was later shifted to the terraces above where the elite had lived in the days before the war. During colonial times, local Chinese trading stores dominated the area. The Chinese had been brought to Lae and Rabaul by German colonials, for their boat building and carpentry skills.  World War II  During the Japanese occupation of Lae, barges from Voco Point would unload to resupply Japanese submarines from Rabaul. Barges included the LSTs MK3 of the RAN. On 18 March, two spotters from the 23rd Heavy Wireless Section watched 12 barges emerge from their Labu swamp hideout to Voco Point to meet a submarine, which was then bombed by the USAAF. The Commander of the submarine, Captain Yahachi Tanabe, was killed. Macarthur's Communique in newspapers reported: \\"LAE: Allied planes bombed Voco Point, drove off 9 Zeros\\". Lyndon B. Johnson was appointed Lieutenant Commander in the United States Naval Reserve on 21 June 1940. Eleven B-26 Marauders of the 22nd Bomb Group departed Townsville on 8 June 1942, arrived in Port Moresby and raided Lae on 9 June 1942. The mission was called \\"TOW 9\\" and Lieutenant Commander Johnson, the future 36th President of the United States, went on this raid as an observer on the aircraft, the Heckling Hare. Nine days after the raid, Johnson was awarded a Silver Star medal for his participation in the above bombing raid. After Lae was liberated from Japanese occupation, 7th Division's Brigadier Eather set off by jeep to replace the Japanese flag on Mount Lunaman with the Australian flag. During the late 1920s, many of the original inhabitants of Voco Point were employed by Australian airlines and traders. Their homes were moved to the 'roun wara' R2 area (now Eriku).  Mount Lunaman  Mount Lunaman is 96 meters high and has a radio tower at the highest point marked by red fixed obstruction lights to assist navigation. At the base of Mount Lunaman at the southern and south- eastern face are the suburbs of Voco Point and Chinatown. The terraces are located to the west of Mount Lunaman. Mount Lunaman is known to the locals as Lo' Wamung, or Locwamu which means \\"first hill\\", Hospital Hill and Fortress Hill by the German settlers. Mount Lunaman and the Lae urban area have been the subject of several tectonic studies relating to plate shift. Voco Point suffers from undersea landslides, because of the very steep shelf, and portions are lost about every 50 years. The last event was in the mid-1950s, when a wading pool in Stewart Park disappeared into the sea. The Rotary Club then re-built the wading pool in the Botanical Gardens. Local clan lore has more fanciful explanations of these losses.  Mount Lunaman during World War II  Mount Lunaman was an important landmark for both Japanese and the Allies: :\\"The men of the South Australian battalion hammered and sawed vigorously at the top of the terrace. They were reconstructing, with captured Japanese tools, the skeleton of the cottage formerly used as the Japanese commander's sanctum. A hole beneath the door led by a tunnel to a labyrinth of passages and apertures which honeycombed Mount Lunaman.\\" In a 1970 TV interview (JNTV) a Japanese general commanding Lae stated that the tunnels were used to house aircraft munitions and Avgas and were within 200m of the nearby airfield. In the same interview the general stated the Japanese utilized the Lutheran hospital at Malahang. Unconfirmed reports state that Mount Lunaman contained the remains of many Japanese soldiers who defended Lae using tunnels: :A Japanese tomb believed to contain bodies of hundreds of Lae defenders was bought by two South Australian men for 1 pound. The tomb lies under Mount Lunaman, which is said to house a hospital and when the Japanese in tunnels refused to surrender to the Australian 7th Division and 9th Division troops in 1943 all entrances were sealed.  Australian Women's Army Service barracks  The 68th Australian Women's Army Service barracks was located on Butibum Road at the base of Mount Lunaman near the present location of Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium. The barracks were constructed by army engineers and New Guinean workers and the compound perimeter was enclosed by a high barbed wire fence patrolled by armed guards. Many women considered the high fences a symbol of constraint and the popular song \\"Don't Fence me In\\" was often sung.Government of Australia Australia's War 1939 -1945, Retrieved 21 Feb 2014 One day after landing in Lae, news came through of the Allied Victory in Europe. A total of 385 AWAS in Lae served under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Margaret Spencer. They served with First Army Headquarters and some supporting units, including in Ordnance and Signals.  Hotel Cecil  In March 1936, Mrs. Flora (Flo) Shaw Stewart (1886‚Äì1979) opened the Hotel Cecil at the base of Mount Lunaman at the location near the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium. In December 1941 Stewart was evacuated to Australia with her two daughters. She returned to Lae at the end of World War II where she took over the Australian Women's Army Service barracks and turned them into a temporary Hotel Cecil for the war-ravaged town. She remained an army nurse until 1948 following protracted battles with officials (Bret Bretag and other councillors) over licensing for the hotel. She finally rebuilt the hotel on its pre-war site in 1951 and operated it until 1957. Reported to cost over ¬£100,000, the hotel took two and a half years to build and has 51 rooms and a dining room. The Hotel Cecil's Bamboo Bar was a very popular \\"watering hole\\" for many local identities of Lae and the district. The new PNG mandate did not allow the sale of alcohol to PNG nationals. The cruise liners of the 1930s, which kept the original hotel in business, did not make a comeback, which left business quite slack. The Stewarts sold the hotel in 1958, and opened the Morobe Theatre in Second Street.  Lae cemetery  Lae cemetery was on the original site at the foot of Mount Lunaman.  Settlements  On 21 May 1991 the Voco Point settlement was evicted and the families were given little time to carry their belongings out of their houses. During this year the government and police also evicted two other settlements. Traders from the Huon Peninsula and Siassi Islands have been subject to harassment and vandalism from the Bumbu settlers, forcing boat operators to moor at alternate locations. In response, businessman Hilmar Wong has built a police station and a lockup at the troubled spot.  Lutheran Shipping  Lutheran Shipping is located at Voco Point. In 1908, Samuel Jericho, one of the few Australian Lutherans to join the mission before World War I, arrived to take charge of the boats. He sailed the first mission vessel, Bavaria, the early forerunner of the fleet of Lutheran Shipping New Guinea. On 7 September 1991, 24 people were missing when MV Simbang capsized near Sialum. 83 people were on board. In 2012 the National Maritime Safety Authority ordered the company to ground four of its eight vessels because they were not seaworthy. Lae Yacht Club  Lae Yacht Club  The yacht club was established in 1950 by Bill Humphries and Bill Carr at Voco Point. Lae Yacht Club moved from Voco Point to the existing premises. On 15 March 2003 the new location was officially opened by the MP Bart Philemon and became the most prestigious yacht club in Papua New Guinea. As of 20 July 2012, membership records exceed 1100 Full Members, Social Members and Associates. NotesExternal links * 1943 World War II photograph of Chinatown.

It was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Rebecca Sugar, Herpich, and Wolfhard. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on July 22, 2013. The episode guest stars Aziz Ansari as DMO, Paul F. Tompkins as the SMOs, and Chuck McCann as Moe. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, BMO, Finn and Jake's sentient computer game, accidentally deletes a core system driver, forcing Finn and Jake disguise to sneak into the MO factory and fix BMO. However, the three are pursued by security guard SMOs (voiced by Tompkins); Finn, Jake, and BMO eventually run into Moseph \\"Moe\\" Giovanni (voiced by McCann), the ancient and benevolent human-cyborg creator of the MOs, who explains BMO's backstory. \\"Be More\\" was originally intended to have been produced during the series' third season, but was later moved to the series' fifth season, by which time it had changed substantially. It was viewed by 2.67 million viewers and received a 0.7 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received largely positive critical reviews, with Oliver Sava from The A.V. Club applauding the extrapolation of BMOs backstory, as well as its potential for narrative expansions. The episode was later nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, but lost to the Mickey Mouse episode \\"O Sole Minnie\\". Plot While deleting files, BMO accidentally deletes its core system drivers. Finn and Jake decide to accompany BMO to the Mo Factory so that BMO can get the drivers re-installed; BMO cautions Finn and Jake that its memory will be erased, so the duo disguise themselves as robots and successfully sneak past DMO (voiced by Aziz Ansari) and infiltrate the facility. Once inside, they find the factory derelict and abandoned. DMO and the security SMOs (voiced by Paul F. Tompkins) soon catch onto Finn, Jake, and BMO's scheme and give chase. The three evade security and sneak into the SMO lounge. BMO hacks into one of the SMOs and learns the location of the core system driver installation deck. Once again, the SMOs give chase until Finn, Jake, and BMO reach the heart of the facility. There, the three meet Moseph \\"Moe\\" Giovanni (voiced by Chuck McCann), the ancient and benevolent human-cyborg creator of the MOs. Moe explains BMO's backstory, revealing that BMO was created to take care of and have fun with Moe's son; however, Moe never had children and so he released BMO into the wild to find another family. Moe updates BMO drivers, and introduces it to his \\"family\\" of MOs. Production Aziz Ansari guest starred in the episode, voicing DMO \\"Be More\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Rebecca Sugar, Herpich, and Wolfhard. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Nate Cash. The episode was originally intended to have been produced during the series' third season, thus the reason that Sugara former storyboard artist on the show who had left after working on the earlier episode \\"Simon & Marcy\\"was credited for having co-written the episode's story. However, the entry was pushed back until it was finalized during the latter part of the fifth season; according to both supervising producer Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar, by the time the episode was being developed during the fifth season, it had substantially changed. The character of Moe was designed by Wolfhard, and was based on actor Jamie Farr. The original ending featured Moe telling Finn, Jake, and BMO to leave because he has to use the bathroom; Wolfhard noted that this was \\"wisely vetoed\\" by Herpich and Muto. Comedian Aziz Ansari plays the part of DMO. In 2011, Ansari had previously been invited by Ward via Twitter to voice a character on the show. Chuck McCann voices Moe. According to storyline writer Jack Pendarvis, series creator Pendleton Ward asked him to be in the show after seeing one of his performances. The episode also guest stars Paul F. Tompkins as the security guard SMOs. Tompkins had previously voiced an unrelated character in the fourth season episode \\"Ignition Point\\". Reception \\"Be More\\" aired on July 22, 2013 on Cartoon Network. It was watched by 2.67 million viewers, and received a 0.7 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic Nielsen household rating. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds at the time of the broadcast. The installment was the 31st most-watched cable program in the 18‚Äì49 demographic on the night it aired. The episode first saw commercial release as part of the 2014 The Suitor DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\". He applauded it for its exploration of BMO, its opening of new narrative opportunities with the introduction of Moe. Furthermore, he complimented both Ansari's and Tompkin's voice acting, noting that the \\"actors hired by this show have speaking voices that are immediately distinct, and that natural personality helps flesh out bit roles and make them memorable.\\" Furthermore, Sava wrote that the entry's climax, featuring Moe explaining that BMO was built to understand fun was \\"an interesting insight into the philosophy behind this series\\" because the \\"childlike mentality of fun and play is an enlightened state in Adventure Time, and BMO reaches that every day with Finn and Jake.\\" The episode was later nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, but lost to the Mickey Mouse episode \\"O Sole Minnie\\".

Background In his previous fight Roy Jones Jr. had captured the WBC light heavyweight championship after defeating Mike McCallum, making Jones a three-division world champion after previously winning titles in the middleweight and super middleweight divisions. For Jones' first defense, he was matched up against the undefeated Montell \\"Ice\\" Griffin, who in his previous fight had defeated James Toney for the second time to capture the less-regarded WBU light heavyweight title. Prior to the fight, Griffin was seen by some as possibly the greatest challenge Jones, who was ranked by The Ring magazine as the number-one pound-for-pound fighter in all of boxing, had faced in his professional career.Jones Faces Surprise In Title Fight If Nothing Else, Montell Griffin Is Unorthodox Enough To Present Problems For The Champ., Philadelphia Inquirer article, 1997-03-20, Retrieved on 2014-02-07 Jones entered the fight as the overwhelming favorite, with the odds being as high as 17‚Äì1 in his favor, though they went down to 6‚Äì1 by the time of the fight. The fight Jones, who had rarely lost rounds on the scorecards, was taken to the limit by Griffin, who controlled the early portion of the fight. Jones eventually regained himself and by round nine, had taken a narrow lead on two of the judge's scorecards with scores of 77‚Äì75 and 76‚Äì75. The other judge, however, had Griffin ahead with a score of 76‚Äì75. In the ninth and final round, Griffin would dictate the pace for most of the first two minutes. But as the second minute came to a close, Jones staggered Griffin with a right hand. Jones then proceeded to attack Griffin in hopes of securing the knockout victory. Overwhelmed by Jones' flurry, Griffin took a knee with 45 seconds remaining in the round in an effort to avoid further punishment. However, Jones then landed a right‚Äìleft combination, causing Griffin to slump forward and lay face-first on the canvas. Referee Tony Perez then proceeded to count Griffin out and the fight was stopped at the 2:27 mark. Thinking he had picked up the knockout victory, Jones began to celebrate with his corner, but Perez then announced that he had disqualified Jones for the illegal blow, giving Jones his first professional loss and making Griffin the new WBC light heavyweight champion.First Loss for Jones By Disqualification, N.Y.

The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, when the Martian deity Grob Gob Glob Grod (voiced by Tom Gammill, Miguel Ferrer, Melissa Villase√±or, and Tom Kenny) comes to arrest Magic Man (voiced by Kenny) for his crimes, he uses his magic to disguise himself as Jake to escape his trial while having the real Jake take his place. Jake is tried by Abraham Lincoln (voiced by Ward), King of Mars, but soon, all is righted when Finn travels to Mars to save his friend. The episode marks both the return of Lincoln, who had appeared in the series' pilot episode, as well as the on-screen debut of the oft-mentioned deity Grob Gob Glob Grod. Ward had originally wanted Bill Nye, Bill Cosby, Bill Clinton, and Bill Murray to voice the character. \\"Sons of Mars\\" helped Cartoon Network mark double digit growth in all kid demos for the night, according to Nielsen ratings. It received largely positive reviews from critics, with many applauding the absurdity apparent in the episode. Plot Magic Man (voiced by Tom Kenny) is spotted by his four-headed Martian brother Grob Gob Glob Grod (voiced by Tom Gammill, Miguel Ferrer, Melissa Villase√±or, and Tom Kenny) comes to arrest Magic Man (voiced by Kenny), who are planning on bringing Magic Man back to Mars to face trial for his many crimes. Magic Man soon runs into Finn and Jake, and knocks them both unconscious. He then physically turns himself into Jake, and transforms Jake into him. Grob Gob Glob Grod, not realizing the difference, seizes Jake and rockets off to Mars. Finn, aware of the charade, forces Magic Man to take him to his house in order to find something that can help him save Jake. Magic Man's house, however, is completely derelict, and is a reflection of Magic Man's \\"sick mind\\". For instance, plants and animals live wildly in the structure, and a tiny Manticore is kept in a glass jar, apparently for Magic Man's amusement. Finn discovers a Martian teleporter that was given to Magic Man in the hopes that he would learn love and voluntarily return to his home planet. Finn warps to Mars, and witnesses Jake being put on trial in front of Abraham Lincoln (voiced by Pendleton Ward), the King of Mars. Magic Man is found guilty, and while Jake tries to plead his case, it falls on deaf ears. Lincoln gives Jake two options: he can either be put to death with the Wand of Disbursement, or Lincoln can use the power of the wand to turn him into living star dust. Before Jake can answer, Finn intervenes, accidentally causing the wand to touch Jake, killing him. Lincoln, realizing his mistake, travels to the 37th Dead World and pleads with Death; in exchange for Jake's soul, Lincoln offers up his immortality. Finn and Jake then rocket back to Earth and punch Magic Man in the face. Finn then frees the tiny Manticore. Production Elements of the episode were borrowed from a scrapped season one episode, storyboarded by Doug TenNapel. \\"Sons of Mars\\" was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Ako Castuera, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, Moynihan, and Doug TenNapel. TenNapel had previously written the storyboard for the scrapped first season episode \\"The Glorriors\\". The reason he was credited for \\"Sons of Mars\\" was because the scene featuring Lincoln interacting with Death was very similar to a scene he boarded in a scrapped season one episode. The entry was directed by Larry Leichliter. According to Moynihan, the episode was originally supposed to be connected to the third-season episode \\"Ghost Princess\\"; in Moynihan's original story, the premise involved both Ghost Princess and Magic Man. In the end, after \\"extensive meetings\\" with the show's writing staff, Moynihan decided to rewrite the episode so that it would serve as a sequel to Magic Man's story. The name \\"Margles\\" was a reference to Moynihan's ex-girlfriend Margaret. Moynihan envisioned the episode as a way to negate any negative energy about their relationship and breakup, thereby \\"exorcis[ing] [the energy] from his heart\\". A large portion of the episode's original draft featured Finn and Jake discovering a strange naturalistic temple inscribed with carvings of Abraham Lincoln. These scenes were excised due to the time constraints of the episode, and creative director Nate Cash storyboarded a shorter scene‚Äîfeaturing Finn and Jake carrying a broken robot‚Äîto take the removed material's place. Ward was very conscientious in how Lincoln was portrayed in the episode; he wanted him to be exclusively referred to as \\"King of Mars\\". This was because he felt Lincoln's appearance in the pilot was solely for cheap laughs. For \\"Sons of Mars\\", Ward wanted his appearance to have real meaning. Dan \\"Ghostshrimp\\" Bandit designed many of the backgrounds in this episode, including most of Magic Man's house; on his Instagram account, Ghostshrimp posted several background stills of this location, writing, \\"This is one of my all time fave locations for some reason! It just makes me feel silly and spooky at the same time!\\" Note: taken from background designer Ghostshrimp's official Instagram. Portions of Magic Man's house feature a number of cardboard boxes labelled \\"Dirt\\", which Ghostshrimp added because he thought they were \\"mysterious and intriguing\\". Note: taken from background designer Ghostshrimp's official Instagram. These sorts of idiosyncratic background details were added because Ghostshrimp was \\"try[ing] to create a story beyond the story!\\" Note: taken from background designer Ghostshrimp's official Instagram. \\"Sons of Mars\\" features the return of several characters, with perhaps the most obvious being Magic Man, voiced by Kenny, who had originally appeared in the first-season episode \\"Freak City\\". Alt URL The episode also features the return appearance of Lincoln as the king of Mars. Lincoln had originally appeared in the series' pilot episode in 2007. Grob Gob Glob Grod, an oft-mentioned deity in the Adventure Time universe appears on screen for the first time in this episode; Moynihan had crafted the character in order to retcon why various names had been ascribed to the being over the course of several seasons. The deity's four heads were voiced by Kenny, Tom Gammill, Melissa Villase√±or, and Miguel Ferrer. (Ward had originally wanted Bill Nye, Bill Cosby, Bill Clinton, and Bill Murray to voice the character.) Ferrer also reprises his role as Death, a character who had first appeared in the second season episode \\"Death in Bloom\\". Reception \\"Sons of Mars\\" officially aired on July 23, 2012 on Cartoon Network. As part of Cartoon Network's Monday night line up, \\"Sons of Mars\\" helped the network show double digit growth in all kid demos for the night, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Jake the Dad DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' fourth and fifth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" and described it as a \\"big mythology episode\\" for the series. He called it \\"a story for long-time fans of Adventure Time\\" due to its reveal of several important characters like Lincoln and Grob Gob Glob Grod. Sava felt that the episode was \\"random\\" and \\"incredibly bizarre\\", but that it gave both a better look at Adventure Times \\"big picture\\" as well as the series' \\"psychedelic panorama of absurdity\\". Sava specifically applauded the episode's merging of bizarre characters and mundane tasks, such as Grod drawing on an overhead projector, as well as the non sequitur ending featuring the tiny manticore. Gordon Miller of Cinema Sentries called the episode one of the \\"standouts\\" of the Jake the Dad DVD, specifically praising the episode's use of Lincoln. Colin O'Boyle of GeekSmash enjoyed the appearance of both Lincoln and the tiny manticore, writing, \\"That, ladies and gents, is one of the reasons I love Adventure Time\\".

Narrated by a young boy named Andy, the story follows the Duvitch family, Croatian immigrants whose physical appearance the narrator immediately marks as both \\"foreign\\" and poor. Though sicknesses typical of the period (typhoid, whooping cough, measles) and dire poverty afflict the family, they remain kind, optimistic, and surprisingly generous.\\"Strangers That Came To Town\\", Short Story Seminar, 2013 The townspeople, however, have trouble looking beyond appearances. They harangue the Duvitch siblings, taunting them for everything from \\"the leaf, lard and black bread sandwiches they ate for lunch\\" to the \\"rag pickers‚Äô clothes\\" they wear to school. After the narrator Andy and his brother Tom poison some fish the Duvitches have caught, making them inedible, their father forces the boys to confess and administers punishment, part of which is facing their victims and owning up to their crime. \\"Father\\" goes a step further that ultimately eases the tension around the entire community. \\"It is high time,\\" Tom and I heard Father say calmly, sanely, to Mother around noon next day when we woke up, \\"for this senseless feeling against the Duvitches to stop and I'm willing to do still more to stop it. Tonight we are having supper with them.\\" In time, the townspeople gradually accept the new arrivals, and the story ends on a note of unexpected generosity. \\"On a cold snowy afternoon in winter Mr. Duvitch stopped at our house and presented Father (who had enormous hands, much bigger than any of the Duvitches') with a handsome pair of leather mittens, lined with fur, which had a slightly acrid ashy odor. 'No doubt one of the boys resurrected them from a heap of ashes in the dump,' remarked Father, drawing on the mittens, which fitted perfectly. 'Why should I value them any the less? Who would have dreamed that the Duvitches would have so much more to offer us than we have to offer them?'\\"\\"The Strangers That Came to Town\\" The story was so popular, it was dramatized in a 1959 television episode of the Loretta Young Show.Loretta Young Show, October 4, 1959 Flack and Theodore Roosevelt Flack reportedly idolized President Theodore Roosevelt, writing the novel Room for Mr. Roosevelt and the teleplay based on it, Make Way for Teddy; and a brief memoir for The New Yorker, Theodore Roosevelt And My Green-Gold Fountain Pen The New Yorker, May 22, 1948 In the story, a 13-year-old Flack sees Roosevelt watching birds in a Syracuse, New York park, where Flack loses his green-gold fountain pen. He later sees Roosevelt in the local courthouse and also spies his pen‚Äîin the former President's pocket. Flack never musters the courage to ask for its return, instead visualizing the pen signing important documents.

Archaeologists‚Äô estimates vary from the Early to the Middle Upper Paleolithic, in between 29,000 and 23,000 years ago, which corresponds to the Aurignacian culture (35,000 to 29,000 years ago) and the Gravettian culture (29,000 to 22,000 years ago). However, the fact that cave bears and rhinos were scarce during those two time periods, makes this dating controversial. Furthermore, the drawings do not appear to be completely uniform.

Her discoveries opened the door for cellular reprogramming and its application to stem cell biology.  Biography  Helen Blau was born in London and is a dual citizen of the United States and Great Britain. She earned a B.A. from the University of York in England and an M.A. and Ph.D. in biology from Harvard University with Fotis C. Kafatos. After a postdoctoral fellowship with Charles J.

She was awarded an endowed chair in 1999 and named Director of the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology in 2002.Ningthoujam, Debananda S. Footprints of Pioneer Scientists-58: Helen M. Blau . Manipur Times. Access date: September 5, 2015 Blau is known for her support of women in science and success in mentoring numerous young scientists who comprise the next generation of academic leaders in muscle biology and regenerative medicine.  Research  In the 1980s Dr. Blau's findings challenged the prevalent view that the mammalian differentiated state is fixed and irreversible. In her famous heterokaryon experiments she fused differentiated cells of two different species to form stable non-dividing heterokaryons, and found that previously silent genes could be activated. As a result, human keratinocytes, hepatocytes and fibroblasts expressed muscle genes that they normally never would. This body of work showed that the differentiated state requires continuous regulation and that a shift in the stoichiometry of trans-acting regulators induces nuclear reprogramming to another differentiated state. Her discoveries fostered the development of the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Blau characterized muscle stem cells and showed they are dysfunctional in aging and in muscular dystrophy. She showed that stem cells lose their regenerative potential when grown in traditional plastic dishes and overcame this limitation by fabricating bioengineered microenvironments that mimic crucial stem cell niche and tissue properties. She has applied this approach to identify molecules that rejuvenate the function of the aged stem cell population and enhance muscle regeneration. Blau showed that telomere dysfunction in conjunction with dystrophin deficiency plays a central role in the skeletal muscle wasting and fatal cardiomyopathy characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Her lab's novel technologies enable rapid, transient and robust elongation of telomeres to overcome cellular dysfunction due to short telomeres, which have translational applications. Dr. Blau's lab applied evolutionary lessons from newts and salamanders that regenerate limbs to identify genes that constitute barriers to regeneration. By transiently alleviating these brakes on the cell cycle, post-mitotic cells are induced to divide, reconstituting a regenerative cell source. A hallmark of Blau's research is the development and application of novel technologies. Her discovery of Œ≤-galactosidase complementation is widely used in drug discovery. Non-invasive bioluminescence imaging enables highly sensitive temporal and spatial resolution of muscle stem cell regenerative function in vivo. Using single cell lineage tracking and the Baxter algorithms her lab developed, cell morphology, movement, cell-cell interactions, division behavior and gene expression can be dynamically monitored, resolving the cellular basis for population changes, in response to pharmacologic interventions. She has eight issued US patents.  Current research  Blau's ongoing research focuses on cellular reprogramming, therapeutic interventions to enhance stem cell function in muscle regeneration, and cell rejuvenation strategies.

Life Born at Norwich on 4 September 1817, he was second son and second child of the six children of Philip Barnes, an architect, by his wife Harriet Futter, daughter of a Norfolk squire. Educated at Bruges from 1826 to 1830 and at home, where one of his tutors was George Borrow, Barnes began his medical career in 1832 as an apprentice in Norwich to Dr. Richard Griffin. When his family moved to London he studied at University College, the Windmill Street school, and at St. George's Hospital. Becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1842, Barnes spent a year in Paris, where he concentrated on mental illness; on his return to London he settled in general practice in Notting Hill. His ambition at this point was to become a medical teacher: he lectured at the Hunterian School of Medicine and on forensic medicine at Dermott's School, and was obstetric surgeon to the Western general dispensary. He graduated M.D. London in 1848, and in 1853 became L.R.C.P. and in 1859 F.R.C.P. On 1 April 1859, Barnes was elected assistant obstetric physician, and on 14 July 1863 obstetric physician, to the London Hospital. He moved on 24 April 1865 to a similar post at St. Thomas's Hospital, where he had lectured on midwifery since April 1862. In 1875, he left St. Thomas's Hospital, where he was dean of the medical school, to become obstetric physician at St. George's Hospital; there he was elected consulting obstetric physician in 1885. He had also acted as physician to the Seamen's Hospital, the East London Hospital for Children, and the Royal Maternity Hospital. Barnes took a prominent part in founding the Obstetrical Society of London in 1858 and was president in 1865‚Äì6. But a dispute with the council of this society led him in 1884 to establish the British Gyn√¶cological Society, of which he was honorary president until his death. The older society was hostile to the performance of ovariotomy and other operations by obstetricians. Barnes was one of the pioneers of operative gyn√¶cology, and prevailed: the two societies were united in the obstetrical and gyn√¶cological section of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1907. At the London College of Physicians Barnes delivered the Lumleian lectures On Convulsive Diseases in Women in 1873 and was censor (1877‚Äì8). He was elected honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1883; of the Medical Society of London in 1893 (he had given the Lettsomian lectures in 1858), and of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society at the centenary meeting of 1905. A leading teacher and gyn√¶cologist in London, Barnes was a rival of James Matthews Duncan both in debates at the Obstetrical Society, and in practice. He was also a director of the Prudential Assurance Company (1848‚Äì9; 1884‚Äì1907), amassed a fortune, and gave to medical institutions including St. George's Hospital, where the pathological laboratory was called after him. He died at Eastbourne on 12 May 1907, and was buried there. Works Barnes was author of: * Obstetrical Operations, 1870; 3rd ed. 1876; translated into French. * Medical and Surgical Diseases of Women, 1873; translated into French. * Obstetric Medicine and Surgery, 2 vols. (with his son, Fancourt Barnes), 1884. * Causes of Puerperal Fever, 1887. In early life Barnes contributed to The Lancet. He wrote also 32 papers in the Transactions of the Obstetrical Society, and an official report on scurvy at the Seamen's Hospital, 1864. Family Barnes married: # Eliza Fawkener, daughter of a London solicitor; and # Alice Maria, daughter of Captain W. G. Hughes, of Carmarthenshire, D.L. and J.P. for that county. By his first wife he had one son, Dr. R. S. Fancourt Barnes, and two daughters, and by his second wife one son and one daughter.

Serang was a terminal station for several months until 20 December 1900. On that day the line extension to Anyer Kidul was finished, thereby completing the entire Banten railway (). Building Given Serang's status as a provincial capital, the station has been a relatively important stop on the Banten railway. This is reflected in the more extensive facilities, such as multiple platforms and tracks. The station actually has four tracks, but the easternmost track is unusable, leaving only three tracks in use. The front of the station building faces west. The building stands on foundations of up to 60 centimeters from the ground. The station building has two main rooms: one for the train dispatcher and station master, and another for administration and ticket sale. Between these two is the waiting area.

The film first released on 25 October 2013 in Whitby at the Bram Stoker International Film Festival, where it won two awards. The film follows a Scottish schoolteacher that begins to see visions of the Owl Man, a strange figure that he was obsessed with as a child. The film was followed by The Unkindness of Ravens and The Black Gloves, both directed by Lawrie Brewster. Plot James (Euan Douglas) is an average school teacher that has been estranged from his mother for years and has only returned to her home to settle her estate after her death. This somewhat baffles his friend Allen (Jamie Scott Gordon), as his own father is undergoing a serious illness and is unlikely to recover. James discovers via letters that he stands to inherit two houses from her: one small and average, the other a large mansion that he is urged to never again visit. Confused, James ignores her request and moves into the house in hopes of making sense of everything, as he cannot remember his early childhood but does vaguely remember living at the house during this time. Soon after he arrives he meets the beautiful American, Eve (Lexy Hulme), who lives nearby in a set of renovated stables. He also finds evidence that he had a mental breakdown as a child, brought about by visions of a creature known as the \\"Owl Man\\" (David Schofield). As James stays at the mansion he begins to fall in love with Eve while also discovering that the house sits atop a series of catacombs and that his parents dabbled in pagan magic in order to achieve fortune. He eventually begins to recall more from his past even as the Owl Man's presence begins to grow increasingly ominous, culminating in James discovering that his parents had been worshipping Moloch, who would grant wishes in exchange for a sacrifice. This causes James to regain his lost memories, discovering that Moloch had been manifesting himself as the Owl Man and that he was supposed to be the sacrifice that Moloch demanded. His parents were unwilling to offer James, so they took in an orphaned American girl as a nanny and murdered her in James's stead, claiming that as they had been her guardians, she was a reasonable substitute. James then realizes that this girl was Eve, which has the unfortunate effect of making Eve remember the events as well and turn into a menacing figure intent on driving James insane via a series of attacks. He tries to flee from the house but finds that Moloch will not allow him to leave. Moloch claims to have no ill will against James; rather his anger is directed at his now deceased parents. He tells James that only finding Eve's bones and putting them to rest will end the haunting and free him. If he does not, Moloch will haunt him forever. James is able to find Eve's bones and puts them to rest in the front yard. Her soul free, Eve leaves the grounds, as a heartbroken James begs her not to go. James visits his friend Allen and tells his story, horrified that his parents made such a monstrous choice, and states that he would not have done the same. Standing up, James feels woozy. He realizes that Allen has poisoned him and plans to kill him using the ritual sacrifice to appease Moloch. Clearly upset, Allen begs for James to forgive him even as he is killing him, explaining that Moloch came to him and offered to save his father (Neil Cooper) if he completed the sacrifice. The film then cuts to Allen driving his father home from the hospital, with a haunted look on his face. The film ends at back to the mansion, where a light suddenly turns on in the catacombs, and a new skull rests in a ceremonial fashion, hinting that James's ghost has taken the place of Eve's and will remain there until another sacrifice is performed. Cast *David Schofield as the Owlman *Lexy Hulme as Eve Turner *Euan Douglas as James Findlay *Jamie Scott Gordon as Allen Milton (as Jamie Gordon) *Alan Ireby as Solicitor *Neil Cooper as Michael Milton *Nancy Joy Page as Flora May Findlay *Graham Robertson as Henry Findlay *Jock Ferguson as Taxi Driver Production Brewster came up with the concept for Lord of Tears while researching Pagan folklore of the Scottish Highlands and discovering the Owlman. He also drew inspiration from Japanese horror films, as he saw that these films heavily utilized their native mythology, which prompted Brewster to want to create a film that did the same with Scottish mythology. Filming took place in Scotland in the Scottish Highlands, Dysart, and Kirkcaldy over a two-week period and completed production in fall of 2012. After filming was complete Brewster ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to gain funding to produce marketing materials, finish the movie's soundtrack, and to send the movie out to film festivals. Release Lord of Tears had its world premiere on 25 October 2013 in Whitby at the Bram Stoker International Film Festival. It went on to feature at several other film festivals including the Belfast Film Festival and the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival. The film received a limited DVD and Blu-ray collector's edition release in 2013 through Brewster's Hex Media and was packaged with the film's soundtrack, a printed booklet, and a downloadable electronic booklet. This release received special note for its shipping packaging, as purchasers received the DVD set wrapped in black tissue paper and topped by a single owl feather. The collector's version later sold out, prompting Hex Media to announce that they were going to release a new three disc special edition that would include new content and that the film would have a new edit, updated color treatment, and sound effects. On 27 June 2014 Lord of Tears received a video on demand release through Vimeo. The film was retitled The Owlman for its UK DVD release through 88 Films in March 2016. Reception Critical reception for Lord of Tears has been largely positive and Bloody Disgusting praised the film's acting and later marked it as one of their best films for 2013. Starburst gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, commenting that the film's selling point might lead some into mistakenly believing that the film was a monster movie rather than the ghost story it is, but commented that \\"Brewster's confident direction allows the film to develop naturally.\\" Ain't It Cool News cited the film's simplicity as a highlight as they felt that Brewster made effective use of the Scottish landscape. Fearnet's Scott Weinberg opined that while the movie did have a few \\"typical indie-style missteps\\", they were ultimately minor and that overall he enjoyed the film. HorrorNews.net gave the film a positive review, commending the film's soundtrack, and performances, writing, \\"Rather than just going the route of horror only, the film tackles things intelligently while also paying slight homage to its roots.\\" Awards *Audience Award at the Bram Stoker International Film Festival (2013, won) *Best Female Lead at the Bram Stoker International Film Festival (2013, won - Lexy Hulme) ReferencesExternal links  Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:British films Category:British horror films Category:Scottish films Category:Films shot in Scotland Category:Films by Scottish directors Category:Films directed by Lawrie Brewster Category:2013 directorial debut films ","title":"Lord of Tears"},{"id":"41889250","text":"Metarctia saalfeldi is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Perry Lakes Basketball Association (PLBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in Perth's western suburbs. The Hawks play their home games at Bendat Basketball Centre. Club history=Background Perry Lakes Basketball Association was established in 1973 as Scarborough City District Basketball Club. It was formed from the amalgamation of three 'Metropolitan' clubs from the Claremont district: City Beach, Claremont and Scarborough. Scarborough City played out of Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium and competed in the Western Australian Basketball Federation's (WABF) District Competition. The men's A Grade team reached the grand final in 1977, 1979 and 1981, finishing as runners-up in their first and third tries while claiming their first premiership in 1979. Following the 1988 season, Scarborough City Basketball Association was renamed Perry Lakes Basketball Association. Formation of the SBL 1989 saw the formation of the State Basketball League (SBL) with both a men's and women's competition. Perry Lakes, trading as the Hawks, entered a team into both the MSBL and WSBL. Both teams had strong inaugural seasons, with the men finishing in second place with a 19‚Äì3 record and the women earning the minor premiership with a first-place finish and a 15‚Äì6 record. They went on to reach the inaugural WSBL Grand Final, where they lost 79‚Äì66 to the Perth Redbacks. It marked the Lady Hawks' first ever grand final appearance‚Äîin the 15 years of the women's District Competition (1974‚Äì1988), the Lady Hawks were unsuccessful in reaching the A Grade women's grand final. Championship era 320x240px 1994 was a significantly memorable year for the club, as both teams reached the grand final. While the Lady Hawks were defeated by the Stirling Senators, the Hawks claimed their maiden MSBL Championship with a 107‚Äì86 win over the Swan City Mustangs, with centre Andy Uphoff earning Grand Final MVP honours for his 29 points and 24 rebounds. Success for the Lady Hawks soon followed as they claimed their first championship in 1998. Between 1998 and 2004, the Lady Hawks played in every WSBL Grand Final, including winning three in a row between 2001 and 2003 under coach Rick Morcom. In a similar dominant era for the men, the Hawks competed in five straight MSBL Grand Finals between 2001 and 2005, as they claimed a four-peat between 2001 and 2004 under coach John Gardiner. During this time, the men were led by forward-centre Matt Burston and guards Joe-Alan Tupaea, Peter Sinfield, Simon Blennerhassett and Trent Mayger, while the women were led by centre Kate Simkovic, forward Melissa McClure and guard Kim Morcom. Commemorative four-peat poster In 2007, the Lady Hawks won their fifth WSBL Championship behind Grand Final MVP Carli Boyanich. In 2008, the Hawks claimed their seventh minor premiership, while the Lady Hawks claimed back-to-back championships behind Grand Final MVP Deanna Smith. Grand Final losses In 2009, the Hawks played in their first MSBL Grand Final since 2005, but fell short of their sixth championship with an 85‚Äì77 loss to the Lakeside Lightning. Season 2010 saw another grand final appearance from the Lady Hawks, while Season 2011 saw the Hawks play in yet another losing MSBL Grand Final. The following year, in 2012, both teams missed the finals for the first time in two decades‚Äîthe Lady Hawks missing out for the first time since 1991 and the Hawks missing out for the first time since 1992. Return to prominence In 2017, now-coach Deanna Smith guided the Lady Hawks back to the WSBL Grand Final, marking the team's first appearance in the championship decider since 2010 as they chased a first title since 2008. They went on to defeat the Mandurah Magic 59‚Äì48 in the grand final to win their seventh WSBL Championship. Toni Farnworth took out the Grand Final MVP award after her dominant performance, particularly in the second half where she had 18 of her 26 points. She shot 8-of-18 from the field, 3-of-7 from downtown and 7-of-8 at the foul line. In 2018, the Hawks returned to the MSBL Grand Final for the first time since 2011, where they chased a first title since 2004. There they defeated the Joondalup Wolves 94‚Äì87 to win their sixth championship. Ben Purser was named Grand Final MVP for his 12 points, 10 rebounds and game-high eight assists. Notable club figures John Gardiner, a Western Australian basketball great, coached over 550 games in the SBL for the Perry Lakes Hawks. Gardiner, who started coaching with the Hawks in 1982, coached the men's team from the inception of the SBL until the conclusion of the 2008 season when he retired. Some of Gardiner's most notable achievements as a Hawks coach include guiding the men to their first championship in 1994, and then putting together four successive titles from 2001 to 2004, making the Hawks men one of the most successful programs in the history of the SBL. He also earned MSBL Coach of the Year honours three times, and upon his death in 2014, Basketball WA announced the naming of the award as the \\"John Gardiner Men's Coach of the Year.\\" Another notable Perry Lakes figure is long-time Juniors Director and former Perry Lakes Stadium manager, Mike Bussell ‚Äì a life member of his junior club, City Beach, his Association, Perry Lakes, and the State body, Basketball WA. In the late 1960s, Bussell played at Perry Lakes Stadium in the Western Australian Basketball Federation (WABF) Metropolitan competition for a team from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). He later joined City Beach Basketball Club in 1978, where he coached a number of teams and served as the club treasurer. He joined the Scarborough City Hawks committee in 1983, before becoming the Junior Competition Director in 1985, a position he held for over 20 years.

The film, starring David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, and Billy Connolly, was inspired by,Outnumbered-inspired film in production 16 March 2012, comedy.co.uk, accessed 15 April 2019 but not related to, the BBC show Outnumbered. Plot Doug McLeod (David Tennant) and his wife Abi (Rosamund Pike) unite following a tense separation to travel to the Scottish Highlands for Doug's father Gordie's (Billy Connolly) 75th birthday. Gordie has terminal cancer so Doug's brother, millionaire Gavin McLeod (Ben Miller) has arranged a lavish party for him, inviting all the important people in the neighbourhood. Despite difficulties getting their three children, Lottie (Emilia Jones), Mickey (Bobby Smalldridge), and Jess (Harriet Turnbull), to leave the house, they hit the road, but find it congested and they are forced to stop overnight. Lottie expresses her troubles with trusting her parents following their recent separation and lies to each other; it is revealed that Doug had an affair, which led to Abi moving out and taking legal proceedings against him. They are only travelling to the Highlands together to appear as a couple for Gordie, not wanting to upset him in his final months. On arriving at Gavin's mansion, a tense rivalry becomes apparent between Doug and Gavin. Gordie, despite being extremely ill, is fun- loving and encourages his grandchildren, particularly Lottie, to let go of their troubles and enjoy life. While Gavin, Doug, Abi and Gavin's wife Margaret (Amelia Bullmore) make the final arrangements for the party, Gordie takes the three children to the beach. He reveals that he is descended from Vikings, a fact that Mickey in particular is excited about; he reveals his desire to be buried \\"the Viking way\\" by being cremated and sent out to sea. He believes this will stop arguments between Doug and Gavin. Later, while Lottie, Mickey and Jess are playing, Gordie dies peacefully. Lottie returns to the house to tell the adults, leaving her siblings with Gordie's body. However, when she arrives she sees them all arguing, Abi telling Doug she also had an affair and will be moving the children to Newcastle, and Gavin with his family over what Gordie wants for his birthday, Lottie returns to the beach without telling them. Fulfilling Gordie's last wish, the three children create an improvised raft, and using petrol from Gordie's pickup, send him out to sea aflame, \\"Viking\\" style. The children return home and tell the adults what has happened. The adults are horrified, and Doug and Gavin head to the beach, where they find Gordie's pick-up truck partially submerged by the high tide; Gavin breaks down in Doug's arms. Abi and Margaret break the news of Gordie's death to the party guests, and word quickly gets out about what the children did. The police arrive to investigate, accompanied by social services worker Agnes Chisholm (Celia Imrie), who interviews the children about their actions, and after speaking with Lottie she contemplates removing them from Doug and Abi's care. The press descend on the house, with Lottie, Jess and Mickey's actions making headlines worldwide. While using Gavin and Margaret's son Kenneth's (Lewis Davie) computer, Mickey and Jess accidentally stumble upon a video of Gavin's wife Margaret attacking a fellow shopper at a supermarket as a result of depression. Gavin also sees it, having been previously unaware of his wife's issues. After the press paints the children's actions as depraved, Doug and Abi make a statement to the press that what their children did was not malicious, and that they support the children's efforts to honour their grandfather, however misguided it may seem; seeing the support the children receive, Chisholm ends her investigation, leaving the children with their parents. In the final scene, Gavin and Doug hold a memorial for Gordie at the beach, where the brothers are shown to have buried the hatchet. Abi tells Doug she will not be moving to Newcastle, and the couple decide to divorce civilly, apologising to their children. The film ends with the extended family honouring Gordie on a hill above the beach with some friends, and then the family playfully splashing around at the water's edge on the beach.

Therefore, initiates are called abakhwetha in isiXhosa: aba means a group, and kwetha means to learn. A single male in the group is known as an umkhwetha.Hunter, L.H.

Practice The initiation ritual is commonly conducted during late June/early July or late November/ early December.Meintjes, G. (1998). Manhood at a price: socio-medical perspectives on Xhosa Traditional Circumcision. Grahamstown: Rhodes University. During the ritual process the traditional surgeon (ingcibi) surgically removes the foreskin. After the cut is made, the period of seclusion that follows lasts about one month and is divided into two phases - but this is rarely the case in modern times and/or in urban areas, where it usually lasts at least 4 weeks. During the first 7 days the initiates are confined to a hut (bhoma) and the use of certain foods, for example meat, is restricted, but this may differ as certain homes have their own beliefs or ways of doing things. Water may also be restricted. This phase culminates in the ukojiswa rite, during which food taboos are released, marking the transition to the second phase that lasts a further two to three weeks. During these phases the initiates are looked after by the ikhankatha (traditional attendant). The termination of the period of seclusion commences when the boys are urged to race down to the river to wash themselves, yet again, depending on the location. The hut (Bhoma) and the initiates' possessions are burnt, including their clothing. This symbolizes a new outward appearance the initiates must take on. It is even customary for the initiated to dress very formally for a set period of time after the rite. Each initiate receives a new blanket and is now called \\"ikrwala\\" (singular) which means new man or amakrwala. (plural) (new men).Papu, J., Verster, P. (2006). A biblical, cultural and missiological critique of traditional circumcision among Xhosa-speaking Christians. Acta Theologica 2:178‚Äì198. Non inititated men are called Indoda. Health concerns At least 969 initiates have died from complications resulting from the ritual since 1995. Accurate statistics are not available for the number of penile amputations, but it is estimated that their number is roughly twice the number of deaths.Rijken, D.J. (2014).

Most deaths and complications are the result of incompetence on the part of traditional practitioners. This is the reason why in particular Pondoland is heavily affected by deaths and complications. The amaMpondo practised the ritual until King Faku prohibited it in the 1820s after he had lost several of his sons from complications. Initiation schools re-emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, and the ritual is now being practised on a large scale.Bank, L. Between boys and men in Pondoland.

In January 2014, Desmond Tutu urged traditional leadership and government to intervene, and \\"to draw on the skills of qualified medical practitioners to enhance our traditional circumcision practices.\\" He furthermore emphasised the cultural importance of the ritual as educational institution, preparing initiates \\"to contribute to building a better society for all.\\"SAPA (9 January 2014). Intervene to stop initiation problems: Tutu. SABC. Retrieved 28 March 2014. Over the summer in 2019 in South Africa, a total of 21 boys died in separate initiation schools throughout the region.

Medical treatment Victims of failed mutilations have reported contemplating suicide due to depression and feeling deprived of their manhood.The South African Medical Journal. Volume 105 nr 4. Cape Town. April 2015. In December 2014, the world's first successful penis transplant was performed by a team led by Dr Andre van der Merwe.

Homosexuality Homosexual men in South Africa are still vilified and criticized by their communities. The ritual practise of ‚ÄòUlwaluko‚Äô is a highly respected and sacred cultural practice among the Xhosa and some Nguni speaking peoples of South Africa. It has been alleged that the impact of the practice may threaten the self-esteem of a homosexual young man, although it is not compulsory for any person to go to the 'bush'. Some homosexual men who partook in this ritual reported doing so in order to receive personal validation of cultural manhood, the same can be said of heterosexual uncircumcised men. Other reasons for partaking in Ulwaluko include fulfilling the desire to meet societal expectations as well as pressure from family to ‚Äòconvert‚Äô to heterosexuality through the process of Ulwaluko.A.Ntonzini, H Ngqangweni.

It in fact reveals nothing of the Xhosa people.S.Mzantsi. The Cape Times. Fury at festival film on Xhosa circumcision. 31 January 2017. The film has been compared to the Oscar winning Moonlight. The practice of 'ulwaluko' is furthermore governed by several pieces of legislation to promote the safety and protection of underage initiates who have fallen victim to unhygienic practices at illegal initiation schools, these laws include the South African Constitution (1996), the Children's Act (2005), the (Eastern Cape) Application of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act (2001), and the Traditional Health Practitioners‚Äô Act (2004). Modern day perceptions Xhosa initiates after circumcision ritual The ancient ritual of Ulwaluko is still perceived as relevant by young Xhosa men, and Xhosa people. [Mdedetyana, 2019] It is a sacred family-oriented practice. Many are emotionally attached and find cultural significance in the ritual. Male circumcision is accessible in the hospital/clinical setting however, this option has not replaced Ulwaluko as it does not equate to the cultural meaning of Ulwaluko beyond the removal of the foreskin.(Mdedetyana, 2019)L.H Payne. Psychology in Society. Nr 52. Durban. 2016. On-line version ISSN 2309-8708. Voluntary medical adult male circumcision for HIV prevention in South Africa: The tensions between medicalised modernity and traditional practices Several ceremonies take place before the young person 'enters' in which the family gathers to seek blessings and see the boy off. The young boys are reintroduced to their ancestors and 'uQamata', they are taught about their history, are taught discipline, to be family men and how to be responsible young people who contribute positively to society. There is absolutely (or should not be) no sex in the bush, hetero or otherwise, as it is considered a holy place safe for children (like Sunday school). Women and young women are not allowed, although in some families even young children may be allowed visitation as young children are venerated and represent purity and innocence. Therefore, the sexual identity of the initiate himself is less of a consideration, if at all, as he is himself still a boy child, therefore his innocence is not severed at the incision but marks (inxeba) a bittersweet transition from boy to man. He is not 'made' a man in the 'bush'. Controversies Details of the ritual are not supposed to be disclosed to females or non-initiated males; according to the principle of 'what happens in the bush, stays in the bush', according to some sources.Zvomuya, P. (18 July 2009). Tackling the matter head-on. Mail & Guardian. Retrieved 28 March 2014. Cultural prejudice may be so great that uncircumcised or 'improperly' circumcised men are attacked and beaten for their lack of conformity, it is not clear conformity to what or the link to the short term practice itself. In March 2014 a young man was assaulted after he had spoken out during a community meeting about the complications he sustained through the ritual.Malan, M. (25 March 2014).

The show also featured appearances from Geoffrey McGivern, Ben Miller and Mark E. Smith. The series' title comes from an old magic magazine \\"The Pallbearer's Review\\". Each episode featured a mixture of sketches, comedy monologues from Sadowitz, as well as magic tricks including a special section dubbed \\"The Roy Walton Moment\\" in which Sadowitz would perform a magic trick invented by his mentor, famed magician Roy Walton. Although not as abundant with profanity or scatological humour as Sadowitz' live stand up, the show nevertheless made heavy use of tasteless and aggressive blue comedy and has been described as one of the most controversial comedy series ever broadcast in the United Kingdom. The final episode ended with the studio being invaded by the armies of all the countries Sadowitz had offended over the course of the series, who then gunned down Sadowitz and Darrell. As a result of the record number of viewer complaints sent to the BBC, The Pall Bearer's Revue was rescheduled to a late night slot, had negative continuity announcements air before the show, and has never been repeated or released on home video or DVD. The series is also frequently cited as the catalyst for the BBC blackballing Sadowitz from the organisation entirely and for his long-standing reputation of being \\"difficult to work with\\". However, in a 2013 interview with the British Comedy Guide, Sadowitz dismissed these claims, stating that Alan Yentob hated the show and saw it as a threat to his job, so Yentob did everything he could to conceal it and make sure as few people as possible saw it.

He is a key figure in the development of the audio programming language Csound, and is associated with computer music gurus Max Mathews and Barry Vercoe. Biography=Education After graduating from Somerset High School in 1974, Boulanger attended New England Conservatory of Music as an undergraduate, where his thesis was a commission by Alan R. Pearlman for the Newton Symphony titled \\"Three Soundscapes for Two Arp 2600 Synthesizers and Orchestra\\". After pursuing a Master's in composition from Virginia Commonwealth University, where Allan Blank was amongst his professors, he obtained a PhD in computer music from the University of California, San Diego where he worked at the Center for Music Experiment and Related Research. Boulanger continued his computer music research at Bell Labs, the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, Interval Research, IBM, and One Laptop per Child. In 1989, Boulanger became a Fulbright professor at the Academy of Music in Krak√≥w, Poland. Boulanger's teachers include Andr√©e Desautels, Nadia Boulanger, Pauline Oliveros, Aaron Copland, and Hugo Norden. Professional life Boulanger started studying at the MIT Experimental Music Studion in 1979 with Barry Vercoe, where he also worked with fellow computer musician John ffitch. While working with Vercoe, Boulanger composed the first Csound composition, Trapped in Convert, which was originally written using MUSIC 11, the precursor to Csound. The piece was ported to Csound in 1986. The same year, Boulanger's composition Three Chapters from the Book of Dreams¬Ç was awarded first prize in the NEWCOMP International Computer Music Competition. In 1990, Boulanger wrote the first vocal composition using the microtonal Bohlen-Pierce scale, Solemn Song for Evening, which also features a radio baton. His compositions have appeared on albums including iChamber (Centaur Records, 2003: Virtual Encounters) and Electro-Acoustic Music, Vol. 1 (Neuma, 1990: From Temporal Silence), and his interactive orchestral and chamber music compositions have been premiered at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Seoul Opera House, and the Beijing Central Conservatory. Boulanger's Radio Baton and PowerGlove Concerto was premiered by the Krakow and Moscow Symphonies. The Csound-based iOS apps csGrain, csSpectral, and csJam were developed by Boulanger's company Boulanger Labs, which also published MUSE, an app for the Leap Motion controller developed in collaboration with BT. Boulanger later composed a concerto for strings and horns with himself as a MUSE soloist. Boulanger also works with brainwave sensor technology to create \\"brainwave\\" music, using interfaces such as NeuroSky's MindWave Mobile EEG Headset. Boulanger is a published author under the MIT Press, for which he has written and edited two canonical Csound and audio programming textbooks, the latter having been co- edited with Victor Lazzarini. Recent works At Moogfest 2017, Boulanger was part of the Berklee College of Music delegation that presented technology for modular synthesizer ensembles, primarily developed by one of Boulanger's proteges and current Berklee faculty Matthew Davidson. Boulanger additionally presented \\"The Sounds of Dreaming\\", a multi-episodic electronic music opera written, produced, and performed with Nona Hendryx. The project featured custom performance controller systems involving Max/MSP/Jitter, OSC, live video synthesis, DMX lighting and Arduino instruments developed by Boulanger and his students. A revised version of the opera was presented in August 2017 at MASS MoCA in collaboration with performance artist Nick Cave. Since 1986, Boulanger has taught electronic music at Berklee College of Music, and has previously been on faculty at other collegiate institutions such as New York University and Brown University. He continues to present regularly at audio and music events including Audio Engineering Society conventions and International Csound Conferences, and is an advocate of integrating music technology with music therapy, some of which he has developed with his students. He was a presenter at the Music & Science Symposium organized by Berklee's Music Therapy department in 2013, and at Berklee Electronic Production & Design department's inaugural Voltage Connect Conference in 2017. In October of the same year, Boulanger and Michael Bierylo, chairman of Berklee's Electronic Production & Design department, visited the Shanghai Vocational School of Contemporary Music and attended the 43rd International Computer Music Conference as presenters. Boulanger's notable students include Elaine Walker, BT, DJ Gomi, Yoon Sang, Marcel Chyrzy≈Ñski, Tobias Enhus, and Paris Smaragdis. Boulanger currently resides with his family in Dighton, Massachusetts.

Life and works Johannes Stenrat was born and seems to have lived most of his life in L√ºbeck; his name appears frequently in the city archives between 1455 and 1484. In records from the time he is always described with the low German word meler, literally meaning painter, but in the Baltic Sea area at the time signifying an artist who is working both as a wood carver and a painter. In 1458 he received a commission to finish an altarpiece for Vadstena Abbey in Sweden. Work on the altarpiece had begun two years before by Hans Hesse, but apparently Hesse never finished his work. It is not entirely clear what parts of the altarpiece was made by which artist. Johannes Stenrat's signature (now erased) was also placed on an altarpiece in B√§linge Church outside Uppsala (also in Sweden). An altarpiece in St. Anne's Museum, L√ºbeck has also been securely attributed to Stenrat, and a painting in St. Nicholas' Church, Rostock displays many similarities with the Vadstena altarpiece. In addition, several altarpieces in Swedish churches (e.g. Kr√•ksm√•la, Rumskulla, Tors√•s, Salem, Sorunda, B√§linge and H√∂gsrum) have been attributed to Johannes Stenrat, but these attributions remain more or less uncertain.

History  The water castle was built in the 13th century as the family seat and Ganerbenburg of the lords of Leonrod, who were descended from the lords of Buttendorf, in order to protect an important road link to the city of Nuremberg. The castle was first mentioned in 1235 with a Rudolf miles de Lewenrode. In the 14th and 16th centuries structural changes were made to the castle. The castle survived the Thirty Years' War unscathed, but shortly afterwards, in 1651, it burned down as a result of negligence - attempts to burn off vegetation in the moat got out of hand - and it was never rebuilt. In the 17th and 18th century a hunting lodge was built. The castle is owned today by a community of heirs that go back to the aristocratic line that died out in 1951. One of the members of the nobile family was Franz Leopold, Baron of Leonrod, who was Bishop of Eichst√§tt from 1867 to 1905 and is one of the most important bishops of this diocese.  Description  This very large castle is surrounded by a deep moat. It has four buildings around a rectangular 20-metre-high bergfried with an elevated entrance, 9 metres above ground level. The bergfried has a ground plan 6 x 6 metres in area and a wall thickness of about 2 metres. In the outer ward is the castle chapel, St. George's, which dates to 1327, and the hunting lodge with its hipped roof and timber-framed upper storey. Today, the castle still has the almost fully preserved bergfried, considerable wall remains, vaults, the castle well in the courtyard and an outlying tower. It has been designated a heritage site.

The founder, asked for his secret of success, said: \\"Every kind of writing is permitted ‚Äì except for the boring kind\\", and \\"I divide all works into two categories: those that I like and those that I don't like. I have no other criterion\\", continuing: \\"And since I'm a poor slob of a publisher who ‚Äì as the critics rightly suspect ‚Äì is himself unable to read or write a decent sentence, I borrowed these two phrases from two of our authors, namely Voltaire and Anton Chekhov.\\" In 2003, Coelho's bestseller The Alchemist appeared on the book fair translated to 52 languages, setting a world record.

Life The fifth child of William Duncan, a merchant, and his wife Isabella Matthews, he was born on 29 April 1826 in Aberdeen. After education at Aberdeen grammar school, he entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, studying Medicine and graduated M.A. in April 1843. He continued study at Edinburgh University in 1845, and, returning to Aberdeen, graduated M.D. in 1846, before he was 21. Duncan spent the winter of 1846‚Äì7 in Paris, attending the lectures of Gabriel Andral, Jean Cruveilhier, Mathieu Orfila, and Alfred- Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau. He returned in April 1847, and shortly became the assistant in Edinburgh of James Young Simpson. He assisted Simpson in his experiments in anaesthetics, and on 4 November 1847 experimentally inhaled chloroform to the point of insensibility. At the end of 1849, after some months of travel in attendance on the Marquess of Bute, Duncan began practice in Edinburgh, mainly as an obstetrician. He became a fellow of the Edinburgh College of Physicians in 1851, and in May 1853 began a course of lectures on midwifery at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine.. He built up a practice, and in 1861 was made physician to the ward for diseases of women in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1863 his proposer being Sir Robert Christison. At this time he was living at 30 Charlotte Square a huge Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1862-63 The house was later sold to Prof William Rutherford Sanders.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1880 He wrote numerous papers on obstetrics, and from 1873 to 1875 was president of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society. In 1870, on the death of Simpson, Duncan was a candidate for the professorship of midwifery at Edinburgh, but was not elected. In 1877 the staff of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, meeting at the house of Sir William Savory, decided to ask him to accept the lectureship on midwifery, then vacant in their school, with the post of obstetric physician to the hospital. He was elected, and came to live at 71 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, London. He immediately became a member of the College of Physicians of London, and in 1883 was elected a fellow, and delivered the Gulstonian lectures. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1883, and in the same year was nominated by the Crown a member of the General Council of Medical Education and Registration. Duncan's practice became large, and his standing in his profession high. In 1890 his health began to fail, and he did not finish his usual course of lectures. He went abroad in July, and after several attacks of angina pectoris he died at Baden-Baden in Germany on 1 September 1890. Works Duncan published in 1866 Fecundity, Fertility, and Sterility; a second edition appeared in 1871. It made him an international reputation as an authority in obstetrics. Other works were: * Researches in Obstetrics (1868); * Treatise on Parametritis and Perimetritis (1869); * The Mortality of Childbed and Maternity Hospitals (1870); * Fecundity, Fertility, Sterility and Allied Topics (1871) * Papers on the Female Perineum (1879); * Clinical Lectures on Diseases of Women (1879, 1883, 1886, 1889); and * On Sterility in Women (1884).

It commemorates the death of 27 lifeboatmen from Southport and St Annes who were lost in the attempt to rescue the crew of the German barque Mexico that had been driven into a sandbank in a gale in 1886. The memorial is in the form of a tomb chest on a tall plinth with carving and inscribed panels. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History In a severe gale on 9 December 1886, the Mexico, a German barque, was driven on to the Horse Bank, a sandbank off Ainsdale, near Southport. Three lifeboats were launched to come to her rescue: Eliza Fernley from Southport, Laura Janet from St Annes, and Charles Biggs from Lytham. The crew from the Mexico were rescued by the Lytham lifeboat, but the other two lifeboats capsized. All thirteen of the crew of the St Annes lifeboat were lost, and only two of the sixteen members of the Southport lifeboat crew survived. It was the worst disaster in the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Following the disaster, John Unwin, the mayor of Southport, set up a Disaster Fund, which raised ¬£31,000. Most of this was used to help the dependants of the men lost, but in January 1887 the Fund allowed each of the three local committees a sum of ¬£200 to erect monuments to commemorate the disaster. The Southport local committee established a competition to design a monument to stand in the cemetery at a cost of no more than ¬£170. The design submitted by Ernest Walter Johnson was accepted, and ¬£185 was allowed for its construction. The sculptor was Thomas Robinson. Description The memorial is constructed in sandstone and polished granite, with plaques in marble. It is about high and about long. The memorial is in the form of a tomb chest on a tall plinth standing on an ashlar base. The base is decorated with rope-work, and on each corner is a bollard with an iron mooring ring. The plinth is in sandstone, and the tomb chest is in granite. There are pilasters on the corners, and each side contains a sunken marble plaque. Above is a cornice, and on the top of the memorial is a carving that represents a broken mast protruding at an angle through waves. Two of the panels contain inscriptions, and the panel on the west side has a relief carving. This carving depicts a view from above of a sinking lifeboat and its crew surrounded by waves. The inscriptions include the following: Appraisal The memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building on 29 July 1999. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". Related monuments The Disaster Fund committee commissioned three other memorials to commemorate the event, another one in Southport, and memorials in Lytham and St Annes. The Southport memorial consists of an obelisk on the Promenade that also commemorates additional events. This is listed at Grade II, as are the memorials in Lytham and St Annes. The memorial in Lytham is in the churchyard of St Cuthbert's Church and has the form of a pinnacled tabernacle. The St Annes memorial stands on the Promenade, and consists of a statue of a lifeboatmen looking out to sea.

Broadway in Centralia, Illinois. The Classical Revival building was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for Centralia Lodge 493, the city's chapter of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. The entrance to the building is flanked by Ionic columns. The second-story windows on the front facade are topped with limestone pediments and segmented arches; the windowsills feature decorative brackets. Limestone cornices top both stories of the building, and a cartouche bordered by scrolls sat on the roofline above the central front window. In 1938-39, the Elks sold the building to a group of local businessmen. The businessmen then leased the building to the Shell Oil Company, and the building became known as the Petroleum Building; around this time, a bowling alley opened in the basement. In 1946, the Centralia chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars purchased the building and used the second floor as a meeting hall. A fire in 1951 caused the bowling alley to close; however, the VFW continued to use the building. The building had been demolished by 2013. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 2011, and was delisted in 2020.

It commemorates the death of 13 lifeboatmen from St Annes who were lost in the attempt to rescue the crew of the German barque Mexico that had been driven into a sandbank in a gale in December 1886. The lifeboat from Southport also lost 14 of its 16 man crew in the disaster. The monument depicts a lifeboatman looking out to sea and standing on a rock-like plinth. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History In a severe gale on 9 December 1886, the Mexico, a German barque, was driven on to the Horse Bank, a sandbank off Ainsdale, near Southport. Three lifeboats were launched to come to her rescue, Laura Janet from St Annes, Eliza Fernley from Southport, and Charles Biggs from Lytham. The crew from the Mexico were rescued by the Lytham lifeboat, but the other two lifeboats capsized. All thirteen of the crew of the St Annes lifeboat were lost, and only two of the sixteen members of the Southport lifeboat crew survived. It was the worst disaster in the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Following the disaster, John Unwin, the mayor of Southport, set up a Disaster Fund, which raised ¬£31,000. Most of this was used to help the dependants of the men lost, but in January 1887 the Fund allowed each of the three local committees a sum of ¬£200 to erect monuments to commemorate the disaster. The St Annes committee commissioned W. B. Rhind to design a monument. This was unveiled on St Annes Promenade on 23 May 1888 by John Talbot Clifton. Description The monument is constructed in sandstone. It has an ashlar tapering plinth approximately square and high. On the plinth is a pedestal with the appearance of a rock, about high. Standing on the pedestal is a larger than life-size figure of a lifeboatman. The lifeboatman looks out to sea. On the south side of the monument is a panel inscribed with the names of those who were lost. Underneath the names is the following inscription: Appraisal The memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building on 15 February 1993. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". Related monuments Three other memorials were commissioned to commemorate the event, two in Southport and one in Lytham, all of which are designated at Grade II. In Southport Cemetery is the Lifeboat Memorial, which is in the form of a tomb chest, and on the Promenade is the Monumental Obelisk, which commemorates other events in addition to the lifeboat disaster.

It originally aired on April 22, 2010. The episode was written by Bryan Oh and Caroline Dries and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot Stefan (Paul Wesley) continues drinking human blood, but he lies and tells everyone that he stopped. He tells Elena (Nina Dobrev) that the worst of his cravings are over, but when he goes to get his bag from his trunk, it is full of empty blood bags. Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) reports another theft of blood bags to John (David Anders) and Damon, (Ian Somerhalder) and John proposes that he and Damon team up to investigate. Damon agrees since he does not want John to reveal to everyone about his true nature. Bonnie (Kat Graham) is back at school after her Gram's death, but she is acting weird. Elena catches up with her outside of class but Bonnie keeps her distance from her while she is more friendly to Caroline (Candice Accola) when she comes to ask her help to choose a dress for the Founder's Ball where she will compete for being Miss Mystic Falls for the year. Elena is also going to participate and she asks Stefan to be her escort who agrees to do it. Anna (Malese Jow) appears in Damon's doorstep to apologize on behalf of her mother Pearl (Kelly Hu) for what the other vampires did to Stefan. She informs him that after the incident, Pearl asked them to leave and now it is only the two of them and Harper (Sterling Sulieman). Damon believes that Pearl and the other vampires are responsible for the robberies at the hospitals, but Anna tells him that they are not responsible for this. Anna leaves and Damon looks suspicious. Stefan comes home from school and Damon starts asking him about the human blood. Stefan insists that he is \\"clean\\", but Damon does not seem to believe him. Stefan leaves the room and heads to the basement get another blood bag but Damon follows him and catches him grabbing a bag out of a stash of human blood. Stefan says he has it under control, but Damon worries and tells him that stealing so many hospital blood bags draws attention their way plus after so many years of not drinking human blood it will not be easy to control it. Stefan, still in denial, tells him that he is fine. John uses his excuse of \\"working with Damon\\" and shows up at the Salvatore house. He asks Damon to help him find one of Jonathan Gilbert's inventions that was lost in the church fire on 1864. John suspects that Pearl has it since she was the one who Jonathan was flirting with. Damon, who realizes that John has no idea where Katherine is so he will not be able to help him, pulls out of the deal and threatens John that he will kill him and the whole council if he reveals that he is a vampire. Elena and Stefan attend the rehearsal for the Founder's Ball's dance along with the other contestants. Bonnie and Caroline are also there and Elena asks Bonnie to talk since she sees that Bonnie is avoiding her. Bonnie explains that she feels like her grandmother died for nothing since the spell for sealing the tomb did not work and the vampires escaped. She blames Stefan and Damon for everything but she does not want to make Elena choose between her and the brothers. Stefan overhears the whole conversation. At the Founder's Ball Anna runs into Damon who takes the opportunity to tell her about John and that he wants something that Pearl must have. Meanwhile, Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) talks with John and tells him that he read Jonathan's journal, something that surprises John but he tells Jeremy that Jonathan was mad. Jeremy sees Anna across the room and excuses himself to go and talk to her. Anna is still mad at him because he wanted her to turn him only to be with Vicky and Jeremy says that she approached him only to save her mother. Anna wonders how he knows and he tells her that he read Elena's journal. Upstairs, Jenna (Sara Canning) helps Elena to get ready for the Ball while they talk about Elena's mother. Elena goes to change and Damon shows up telling her about Stefan still drinking human blood. Elena looks shocked hearing it when Stefan gets into the room. Damon leaves and Stefan keeps denying that the blood drinking changed him. Mrs. Lockwood (Susan Walters) interrupts their fight and tells Stefan he has to wait for Elena downstairs. Stefan leaves the room and heads to the bathroom clearly mad that Elena knows. Amber (Spencer Locke), one of the other contestants, gets into the bathroom and sees him. In the meantime, the girls make their entrance one by one, Mrs. Lockwood notices that Amber is missing and Elena also can't find Stefan while she is coming down the stairs. Damon immediately steps in and escorts Elena to the dance floor and dances with her. They whisper to each other about where Stefan might be and Damon says that they should end with the dance first and then they will look for him. Stefan, who kidnapped Amber, drags her along the street to his car. Stefan is torn about what he wants to do with her; he wants to feed on her but at the same time he does not want to do it because that is not him and if he does it then there will not be turning back. In the meantime, he has compelled Amber so she won't be afraid of him and when he tells her that he wants to drink her blood, Amber urges him to do it. Stefan bites her not able to resist anymore to his hunger. Back at the Founder's Ball, Mayor Lockwood (Robert Pralgo) announces the winner of the Miss Mystic Falls who is Caroline. After the announcement Damon, Elena and Bonnie leave to search for Stefan while John finds out that the mother's name of the girl who was with Jeremy is Pearl. That is all he needs to know to understand that she is a vampire from the tomb. Meanwhile, Stefan has stopped drinking from Amber who, due to his compulsion, tells him that it does not hurt if he wants to drink more. Stefan, then, reverses his compulsion making her afraid of him and asking her to run. Amber runs away but Stefan appears in front of her saying that he changed his mind and bites her again. Amber starts screaming when Damon arrives with Elena and Bonnie, and Stefan releases her. Damon tries to stop him but Stefan throws him away and then Bonnie uses her powers giving Stefan a headache, snapping him out of his bloody rage and he collapses. When Bonnie stops, Stefan gets up and runs away. Sheriff Forbes arrives to the scene and Elena, Bonnie and Damon hide what really happened. Elena tries to talk to Bonnie but Bonnie makes her decision and tells her that she wants to stay away from her as long as she is not stepping away from the Salvatores. Damon returns home and finds Anna and Pearl waiting for him. Pearls gives him the device she took from Jonathan Gilbert but she does not know what it does. She thought she had gotten the watch that traces vampires but she realized her mistake the night she was caught. The episode ends with Elena going to Stefan's bedroom. Stefan tells her that she should not be there and that earlier she saw who he really is; a monster. Elena keeps telling him that he is not that person and they fight. In a moment of no control, he pushes her against the wall and Elena looks scared. Stefan apologizes, they embrace and he starts crying. Elena promises him that she will help him and everything will be fine while she injects him with vervain. Stefan collapses and Elena, along with Damon, lock Stefan in the basement to detox. They both sit outside of the cell.

Reviews \\"Miss Mystic Falls\\" received positive reviews. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.6/5 saying: \\"The first half of this week's episode started slowly, as Stefan was hooked on human blood, but denying it to Damon and Elena. But \\"Miss Mystic Falls\\" soon picked up the pace and Paul Wesley sent Ian Somerhalder a message: two can play scary!\\" Richenthal also praised Wesley's acting stating: \\"Wesley played this role perfectly, especially when it came to depicting Stefan's internal struggle. Damon may have learned to control his feeding habits and actually embraces his dark side... but Stefan still wants to fight it, scaring himself as much as anyone else when the urge kicks in.\\" Robin Franson Pruter rated the episode with 4/4. \\"Quality execution lifts up an inauspicious premise, making this episode a winner, with good direction providing the crowning touch. The premise of the episode‚ÄîElena and Caroline competing with a few other girls in a local pageant‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt seem that promising. However, the execution of the episode along with the development of the serialized stories‚ÄîStefan‚Äôs spiral toward rock bottom, Damon‚Äôs growing attraction to Elena‚Äîmake it top-notch.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.5/4. He commented on Damon and Elena's relationship saying: \\"Damon dancing with Elena wasn‚Äôt just about him covering for Stefan, it was also him wanting to be Elena‚Äôs friend. Their relationship is one that doesn‚Äôt have reference to the past‚Äîit‚Äôs not about what‚Äôs expected, or fulfilling old patterns, or replaying the same stories. It‚Äôs something else, but neither Damon nor Elena knows exactly what yet.\\" Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that it was another solid episode. \\"This week's episode of The Vampire Diaries is all about pageantry and addiction ‚Äî and it's juicy in more ways than one. We already had a sneak peek at the Miss Mystic Falls event, but seeing Damon and Elena actively dancing together with my own eyes was so much better!\\" References Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 1) episodes ","title":"Miss Mystic Falls"},{"id":"41889999","text":"Charles Johnston Charles Johnston (17 February 1867 ‚Äì 16 October 1931) was an Irish writer, journalist, theosophist, naturalist, and Sanskrit scholar. Johnston joined the Indian Civil Service in 1888 but left India after two years due to malaria and settled in the United States of America in 1896. He wrote numerous books on Indian philosophy, translating works from Sanskrit as well as on Theosophy. He was married to the niece of Madame Blavatsky and was involved in the development of the Theosophical Society in the United States. Biography He was born on 17 February 1867 in the small village of Ballykilbeg (in Downpatrick), County Down, Northern Ireland. His father, William Johnston (1829‚Äì1902), was an Irish politician, a member of parliament from South Belfast, and a member of the Orange Order. His maternal grandfather was Sir John Hay, 5th baronet of Haystoun. Charles Johnston studied at Derby, England and Dublin University becoming interested in Oriental Studies, and learned Sanskrit, Russian and German. Among his classmates were William Butler Yeats and George William Russell, with whom he shared an interest in the occult. Later, Johnston worked as a journalist. In 1884, he read Alfred Percy Sinnett's work The Occult World and founded, together with Yeats and Russell on 16 June 1885, the Hermetic Society in Dublin. After 1885 he also joined the Theosophical Society, and co-founded in April/June 1886 the Theosophical Lodge in Dublin. He was responsible for introducing Yeats to Madame Blavatsky in spring 1887. On 14 October 1888 he married Vera Vladimirovna de Zhelihovsky (1864‚Äì1923), the niece of Helena Blavatsky. He also entered the Indian Civil Service the same year, and served for two years in the British Bengal Service before contracting malaria. He resigned and was treated in Austria. Johnston translated several works from Sanskrit and Russian. As an author, he devoted himself primarily to philosophical and theosophical topics. When the Theosophical Society split in 1895, he followed the direction of William Quan Judge and was a member of the Theosophical Society in America (TGinA). After Judge's death the following year, Katherine Tingley came to head the organization. Then in 1898, Johnston, who had initially supported Tingley, seceded from Tingley's organization along with some 200 other members led by Ernest Temple Hargrove to form the Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove) Branch. Johnston was president of the Irish Literary Society. Johnston was also a member of the Linnean Society of New York and was a keen observer of birds especially in the New York region. He influenced several young ornithologists including Ludlow Griscom (whose father was involved in the Theosophical movement) and Joseph Hickey.

This railway line is a important strategic connectivity for Indian Military and Defence. History The line from Jalandhar City to Mukerian City was constructed in 1915. The Mukerian city to Pathankot jn line was built in 1952. The construction of the Pathankot‚ÄìJammu Tawi line was initiated in 1965, after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, and opened in 1971. Railway tracks between Jalandhar and Jammu Tawi have been doubled. Electrification of railway track between Jalandhar and Jammu Tawi was completed in 2014. Speed limit The Jammu ‚Äì Jalandhar Cantonment line is classified as a \\"Group B\\" line and can take speeds up to 130 km/h Passenger movement Jalandhar City and Jammu Tawi, on this line, are amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railway. DMU shed India‚Äôs first and largest DMU shed at Jalandhar holds 90 units placed in service in rural Punjab. It also houses two BEML built rail buses which operate on the Beas‚ÄìGoindwal Sahib line. Loco sheds Jammu has a trip shed for visiting locos where WDS-4 locos belonging to Shakurbasti shed are retained for long periods. Pathankot Cantonment (Chakki Bank) had a steam shed which has now been decommissioned. Jalandhar City and Ludhiana have Electric Loco Sheds.  Bridges There are many major and minor bridges in the Jalandhar City ‚Äì Jammu Tawi line. The most important bridges are The long Beas River Bridge at Mirthal, The long Chakki River Bridge at Pathankot, The long Ravi River Bridge at Madhopur, The long Bridge on Degh Nalah at Ghagwal, The long Bridge on Basantar River at Samba and The long Bridge on River Unjh at Vijaypur Jammu. Railway reorganisation Sind Railway (later reorganised as Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway) was formed a guaranteed railway in 1856. It constructed broad gauge railways from Delhi to Multan via Lahore, and from Karachi to Kotri. Multan and Kotri were connected by ferry service on the Indus River. In 1871-72, Indus Valley Railway was formed to connect Multan and Kotri. At the same time, Punjab Northern State Railway started constructing from Lahore towards Peshawar. In 1886, Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway was acquired by the state and amalgamated with Indus Valley Railway and Punjab Northern State Railway to form North-Western State Railway. With the partition of India in 1947, North Western Railway was split. While the western portion became Pakistan West Railway, and later Pakistan Railways, the eastern part became Eastern Punjab Railway. In 1952, Northern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company west of Mughalsarai, Jodhpur Railway, Bikaner Railway and Eastern Punjab Railway.

R. Martin. The success of the HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones has made the show's version of the royal seat an icon of the entire media franchise. Martin said in 2013, \\"Say Game of Thrones, and people think of the HBO Iron Throne.\\" Martin called the depiction of the throne in his 2014 A Song of Ice and Fire companion book The World of Ice & Fire \\"absolutely right\\". He has noted repeatedly that none of the previous media representations of the throne‚Äîincluding books, games and the TV series‚Äîclosely resemble what he had in mind when writing his novels. A Song of Ice and Fire In the series, the Iron Throne is both a physical seat of office as well as a metonym for the monarchy of Westeros. Martin establishes in A Game of Thrones (1996) that after seizing control of six of the Seven Kingdoms, Targaryen ruler Aegon the Conqueror had made a throne for himself from the swords of his vanquished enemies, fused by dragonfire. Aegon had established King's Landing as the royal capital, and the Iron Throne itself sits in the Red Keep. Martin writes that according to legend, Aegon kept the blades sharp so that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne; it is a common belief that such rulers are therefore unfit to rule. Description Purportedly made from a thousand swords and knives, the Iron Throne is a massive and asymmetrical tangle of jagged and twisted blades, in which reclining is impossible. Martin commented in 2014: Depictions The Iron Throne has been depicted in comic books, in games, and on book covers, but Martin has noted repeatedly that none of these representations coincided with what he imagined: To Martin, the attempt closest to his vision was by French artist Marc Simonetti, for a Mexican edition of A Game of Thrones. The author subsequently worked with Simonetti to get an image the author calls \\"absolutely right\\". This depiction appears in Martin's 2014 companion book The World of Ice & Fire. He noted, \\"From now on, THIS will be the reference I give to every other artist tackling a throne room scene.\\" Martin said of the image: The various depictions of the throne include: * The Art of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (2005); Title page by Michael Komarck (Jaime Lannister on the Iron Throne) * A Game of Thrones (2014); Cover by Marc Simonetti (Random House M√©xico, ) * The World of Ice & Fire (2014); \\"The Targaryen Kings\\", art by Marc Simonetti * A Game of Thrones: Genesis video game (2011); Box cover by Marc Simonetti * A Game of Thrones: The Card Game; \\"The Price of Nobility\\" card (2009), art by Alex Aparin (Return of the Others set) * A Game of Thrones: The Card Game; \\"Aegon's Legacy\\" card (2009), art by Veronica V.

The design of the Iron Throne for the show was conceived by its production designer Gemma Jackson, and the prop maker Gavin Jones constructed the piece. The show's popularity has made its version of the throne an icon of the entire media franchise. It has been parodied in magazines and used in merchandising. Several \\"promotional thrones\\" travel the world with show-sponsored exhibits and for fan events. In June 2014, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Belfast set of Game of Thrones and was photographed examining the Iron Throne set piece from the series, though she declined to sit on it. Though Martin had previously stated that the HBO version of the Iron Throne did not match his idea of how it should appear ideally, in 2013 he called its design \\"terrific\\" and claimed to own all of the merchandised replicas. He added: Of the feasibility of recreating the throne as depicted in The World of Ice & Fire, Martin said in October 2014: Game of Thrones Iron Throne Blonde Ale from Brewery Ommegang The image of Sean Bean as Ned Stark sitting in the Iron Throne is featured on the covers of the 2011 Season 1 DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, released in March 2012.

It typically takes six to seven minutes to perform and is scored for three flutes, strings, harpsichord, and percussion, including piano. It opens with the sound of the gong and other clashing cymbals, which then makes way for a harpsichord solo, which then leads to the string section. After the glissandi of the strings, a central section with the cymbals and some pizzicati strings is presented, and then, the harpsichord, together with the rest of the orchestra, introduces the flute, which proceeds to perform a solo cadenza. Then, the percussion and the harpsichord, in a trembling manner, go on to the next section, recognisable for the use of the tubular bells. The work finishes with a solo flute in its lowest register, accompanied by the strings, the vibraphone and the vibraslap.

However, as a whole the reviewers generally enjoyed the film and believed that Begos did show future potential.

Structure and location  The Hochstein (345 m) belongs to the many bunter sandstone rock formations that are typical of the Wasgau, a region that covers the southern part of the Palatine Forest and the northern part of the Vosges. Because the region of Dahn is especially rich in such landforms, it is known as the Dahn Rock Country (Dahner Felsenland). The Hochstein - like the other rock outcrops of the region - is made of a harder rock that has partly withstood erosion over the centuries. The entire massif runs for 1¬Ω km east of Dahn across the Wieslauter stream and is heavily subdivided. Especially striking is the Hochsteinnadel (\\"Hochstein Needle\\") at the western tip of the massif, near St. Michael's Chapel. Next is the Gratturm, followed by the main Hochsteingrat ridge itself. From here there are outlying spurs running northeast and south, of which the Haferfels stands out.  Flora  The remains of ancient juniper bushes are especially valuable, as are luminescent mosses in small corners of the Hochsteingrat.  Features  In some places the leachate has created especially delicate weathering patterns. Towards the end of the Second World War, families in Dahn sought refuge for a long time under overhanging rocks. Traces of their emergency shelter are still visible. At the foot of the Hochstein is Dahn Cemetery which, with its 2,400 graves, is one of the largest war cemeteries in Germany.

Nadezhda and the rest of the insects were traveling inside a sealed special container, and a video-camera was filming the whole process. What was considered unnatural for the newborn cockroaches was that their carapace had darkened in colour much earlier, in comparison with natural- condition cockroaches who develop that darker tone later in their life cycle. But the rest of the conditions and capacities of the cockroaches remained normal. Later it was reported that Nadezhda's grandchildren, born to one of the space-born insects, had given birth on earth to normal cockroaches, with a life cycle and development similar to that of any other cockroach.

Launched in 1969 it was intended for operations over the Pacific Ocean; however, it spent most of its service life over the Indian Ocean at a longitude of 63 degrees east. The third of eight Intelsat III satellites to be launched, Intelsat III F-3 was built by TRW. It was a spacecraft, with its mass reducing to by entry into service as it burned propellant to reach its final orbit. The satellite carried an SVM-2 apogee motor for propulsion and was equipped with two transponders powered by body-mounted solar cells generating 183 watts of power. It was designed for 5 years of service life. The launch of Intelsat III F-3 made use of a Delta M rocket flying from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch, which was conducted by NASA, took place at 00:39:00 UTC on February 6, 1969, with the spacecraft entering a geosynchronous transfer orbit. Shortly after launch, Intelsat III F-3 fired its apogee motor to achieve geostationary orbit. Intended to be operated over the Pacific Ocean at a longitude of 174¬∞ east, Intelsat III F-3 was moved to the less important Indian Ocean slot at 63¬∞ east after only three months in orbit due to concerns regarding its reliability. The satellite was only regarded as partially operable; however, it remained in service until April 1979, before being decommissioned in December of that year. At the end of its service life, Intelsat III F-3 was raised into a higher orbit to reduce the probability of it colliding with an operational spacecraft. As of February 3, 2014 it remains in orbit, with a perigee of , an apogee of , inclination of 18.63 degrees and an orbital period of 28.25 hours.

In 2007, she joined the Russian national speed skating team. Graf is married to Rustam Madaminov and lives in Kolomna, Russia. She speaks Russian, German and English. Early speed skating career Graf gradually worked her way up the world standings in women's speed skating. In her debut 2007‚Äì08 World Cup appearance she finished 56th in the 3000m/5000m. In the 2009‚Äì10 World Cup she improved her 3000m/5000m result slightly to 46th. She performed better that year in the 1500m where she finished 35th.

It is dated to the Magdalenian, about 12,000 years old. Discovery On the night of 19 July 1956 there was a heavy storm in North Hessen. This caused the stream northwest of Rh√ºnda, the Rh√ºndabach, to strongly erode the field that is now the Rh√ºnda sports ground. On the morning of 20 July, a villager found parts of a hominid skull in the newly-eroded stream bed, about below the ground surface. The skull pieces were covered in calcareous sinter and surrounded by lime-rich tuff, loess, and basalt fragments. History of Research The find was passed on to Prof. Dr. Eduard Jacobshagen in the Department of Anatomy and Anthropology at the University of Marburg. On 26 August 1956, Prof. Jacobshagen present his research at the international congress 'Hundert Jahre Neanderthaler: 1856‚Äì1956 [a century of Neanderthals]' in D√ºsseldorf. From his reconstruction of the skull, he postulated it belonged to the species Homo neanderthalensis, i.e. a Neanderthal. This would mean the fossil was 30.000 years old. Furthermore, he thought the bones belonged to a female. Heberer and Kurth from G√∂ttingen University reconstructed the skull again and carried out fluorine and 14carbon dating on the surrounding material. They suggested the skull belong to a 'modern' homo sapiens sapiens. Together with the 14carbon age of the calcareous sinter that surrounded the skull at 8,365 ¬± 100 BP, the owner of the skull was thus firmly believed to have lived in the late to early Preboreal. This correlates to the Mesolithic period. In 2002 Wilfried Rosendahl sent 2 g of the skull to the Centre for Isotope Research () at the University of Groningen. Using the accelerator mass spectrometry 14carbon method, they dated the sample at 10,000¬±80 years BP. After calibration (with INTCAL 98), this gave an age of 10,015‚Äì9,747 BP, which correlates to the Magdalenian-Azilian period, at the beginning of the European Mesolithic. They also showed that the skull belonged to a man. The skull resides in the Museum of Hessian History in Kassel; there is a copy in the museum in Gensungen, close to Felsberg.

It is managed by Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. History A chest examination at Hackney Hospital in 1943 The hospital has its origins in the Homerton Fever Hospital, which opened at the north of the current site in December 1870. A smallpox hospital, built on adjacent land, opened in February 1871. The two facilities merged as the Eastern Fever Hospital in 1884 and a new isolation block was built in 1935. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 as the Eastern Hospital and became increasingly focused on neurological patients before closing down in 1982. Construction of the new Homerton Hospital began in 1982 and was completed in July 1986. The hospital was built at a cost of ¬£20 million and was opened by the Princess Royal in March 1987. As well as replacing the Eastern Hospital, the new hospital replaced the Mothers' Hospital Lower Clapton Road in Hackney, which closed in 1986, and the German Hospital on Ritson Road, which closed in 1987. Clinical throughput increased further when the Hackney Hospital on Homerton High Street closed in 1995 and services were transferred to the current site. The hospital was the designated hospital for the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. Services The hospital services the East London borough of Hackney and also the City of London. Specialist care is provided in obstetrics, neonatology, fetal medicine, laparoscopic surgery, fertility, bariatric surgery, obesity surgery and neurorehabilitation. The hospital directly employs 3500 staff. The hospital received \\"excellent\\" both for service quality and use of resources in the Care Quality Commission (CQC) ratings and top rating of 3 stars with the Healthcare Commission in 2009-10. It holds the level 2 NHS Litigation Authority rating for safety for both general and maternity services. In October 2013 as a result of the Keogh Review the Trust was put into the highest risk category by the Care Quality Commission however the first CQC report following rated the A&E; dept as 'outstanding'. Teaching The hospital serves as teaching hospital for medical students from Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry as well as radiography students from City, University of London. It also provides post graduate training in all major specialities. Transport London Buses routes 26, 30, 236, 242, 276, 308, 394, 425, 488 and W15 serve the hospital.

Prosperity, power and recognition by society are the three aspects of man‚Äôs life that constitute aishvarya which term also refers to the aishvarya or greatness of God and of Brahman. Overview The word Aishvarya is derived from the word ‡§à‡§∂ meaning supreme, powerful, lord or master or God as in the phrase - ‡§à‡§∂‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‚Äì God certainly resides in all this (Isha Upanishad Mantra 1). It is directly connected with one‚Äôs ego at the individual level, and with the assumed nature of God. Basic understanding of the term Prosperity, power and recognition by society are the three aspects of man‚Äôs life that constitute aishvarya. They are the basic needs and aspirations of man about which he dreams and he plans and for achieving which objectives he performs varying deeds. He also eagerly strives to know about the timing and extent of their fulfillment for which he has devised different means and methods. In Hindu astrology, Vaibhava ('opulence'), which includes Prabhava ('influence'), Dhana ('wealth') and Aishvarya ('magnificence'), is represented by the 6th house, the 9th house and the 11th house from the lagna and their respective lords. Mantreswara in the Chapter XX of his Phaladeepika states that during the dasha of the strong lord of the 6th house one gains aishvarya and crushes foes, during the dasha of the strong lord of the 9th house a person enjoys aishvarya, and during the dasha of the strong lord of the 11th house one experiences constant increase of aishvarya. Shakti as Goddess Annapoorna fulfills the most basic physiological need of man that of food items and clothes; as Goddess Durga Shakti fulfills the needs such as shelter and safety from natural and man-made threats; as Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Saraswati Shakti fulfills the social needs such as education, social status and recognition in the society; out of the eight forms of Lakshmi, Aishvarya Lakshmi refers to riches and Dhana Lakshmi, to gold and money. Upanishadic exposition The sage of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad describes the all-pervading aishvarya or greatness of the Lord (Brahman) in the following words: :‡§§‡§Æ‡•á‡§ï‡§®‡•á‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡§Ç ‡§∑‡•ã‡§°‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∂‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§É  :‡§Ö‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ï‡•à‡§É ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç‡§≠‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡•à‡§ï‡§™‡§æ‡§∂‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§≠‡•á‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•à‡§ï‡§Æ‡•ã‡§π‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç  :‚ÄúThey saw him as the one rim (of the wheel), with three tiers, sixteen ends, fifty spokes, twenty fasteners, having six variations of eight extensions, one bondage of infinite forms, three different paths and the two (Virtue and Vice) which cause delusion.‚Äù The wheel is the Brahma-chakra, the repeated cycle of origination and destruction of inanimate things, and of birth and death of all living beings; the rim is the singular non-dual support of the Karya Jagat which is the unreal whole world of phenomenon of effects and has Maya as its source. The Karya Jagat is covered by the three Gunasi.e. by (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas), and their sixteen transformations or manifestations (the five primordial elements, the mind, the five sense organs and the five organs of action) which give satisfaction and pleasure through contacts with objects and constitute the Prakrti ashtakam (existence and awareness of objects), the DhƒÅtu ashtakam (the contact of senses with the objects) and the Aishvarya ashtakam (the psychological forces which bind and cause one to rotate in samsara) which are the three kinds of bondages. The fifty spokes are the fifty psychological forces or misconceptions due to Maya. The one bondage of infinite forms is the fundamental bondage consisting of VƒÅsanƒÅ i.e. desire or emotion. There are the eight siddhis or successes. \\"Righteousness\\", \\"Unrighteousness\\" and \\"Knowledge\\" are the three paths, and virtue and vice are the two factors that cause delusion. Aishvarya yoga of Bhagavad Gita Bhagavad Gita in its own way, presents Krishna as the Supreme Godhead and the supreme object of worship. Krishna tells Arjuna:- :‡§® ‡§ö ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§Æ‡•à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§≠‡•É‡§®‡•ç‡§® ‡§ö ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡§É  \\"‚ÄúNor do beings exist (in reality) in Me ‚Äì Behold My Divine Yoga supporting all beings, but not dwelling in them, I am My Self, the efficient cause of all beings.‚Äù - Bhagavad Gita IX.5. In this regard, Chinmayananda explains that ‚Äì‚ÄúIn Pure Awareness, in Its Infinite Nature of sheer Knowledge, there never was, never is and never can be any world of pluralistic embodiment. Pure Consciousness, Divine and Eternal, is the substratum that sustains and illumines the entire panorama of the ever- changing plurality.‚Äù and Prabhupada explains that the Lord is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies because of which creation takes place and therefore all things rests on Him but He is different from all things, this is the yogam aisvaram, the mystic power of God. Jayadayal Goyandaka explains that when a man realizes God, then nothing exists in his conception of God; therefore in the eyes of him who has attained this state, the world does not exist in God, in reality nothing exists but God. The words Aisvaram yogam denote the wonderful power of God, that of remaining absolutely detached from everything, and the words MaMa Atma refer to His qualified, formless aspect. Shaivite exposition The Shaivites know aishvarya or Aishvarya-tattva as the Ishvara-tattva, the tattva of realizing what constitutes the Lordliness and the Glory of the Divine Being. It is the stage which succeeds Sada-Shiva Tattva as the stage of making a full survey of, identification with, what constitutes the state of the Experiencer, of the pure and undivided \\"this\\" aspect of his being as a whole, of the Ideal Universe hitherto lurking as an indistinct picture in the background of the Being. The Sadakhya or the Sada-Shiva Tattva state is Jnana, the power of being conscious or the experience of the \\"I\\", and Aishvarya or the Ishvara-tattva is true identification or the experience of being identified with and merged into the \\"this\\" of the vakya \\"I am This\\". It is the fourth step in the evolution of mental aspects of universal manifestation. Vaishnava exposition Aishvarya is the Sanskrit term derived from Ishvara that refers to the opulence and power of God. According to Gaudiya Vaishnavism, God has both a public face and a private face. Manifesting his power and majesty (aishvarya), he is known as Narayana and is served in awe and reverence, when his beauty and sweetness (madhurya) overshadows his majesty he is known as Krishna-aishvarya (God‚Äôs supreme divinity and power) is one of the general dimensions of Krishna‚Äôs Divinity described by Chaitanya school, the other two being ‚Äì madhurya ('divine tenderness and intimacy') and karunya ('compassion and protection'). This school favours the madhurya aspect rather than aishvarya aspect in which the Jiva does not experience a love for God as exalted as is experienced by the devotee in madhurya aspect. Manifestations of the aishvarya aspect assist in the realization of Krishna‚Äôs madhurya aspect. According to Vishnu Purana, Aishvarya ('Omnipotence or Controlling power or Transcendent majesty' ) is one of the six folds of God‚Äôs majesty, the other five being ‚Äì Dharma or Virya ('Virtue or Potency or Creative power'), Yasha ('Glory, Fame, Universal honour'), Sri ('Beauty, Prosperity or Radiant beauty'), Jnana ('Omniscience, Knowledge, Omniscient knowledge') and Vairagya ('Non-affectedness or Dispassion or Renunciation or Serene dispassion'), which attributes eternally reside in God in the relation known as samavaya-sambandha ('perpetual co-inherence'), the inseparable relation that exists between substance and quality. God‚Äôs divine potency, inconceivable to human mind, is natural to Him and constitutes His essence; God‚Äôs relation with his Divine potency is one of inconceivable difference in non-difference known as achintya-bhedabheda, the recognition of the nature of which relation is Chaitanya‚Äôs philosophy of achintya bhedabheda-vada. God‚Äôs aishvarya includes his embodied life as the universe and his avatars descending into it. Govinda which term means the Indra of cows and the rescuer of earth that was taken to a secret place also refers to the late evening and Phalguna-masa (month) as does Madhava which refers to early morning and Magha- masa (month). Govinda is aishvarya and Madhava is virya.

Srigufwara was given Tehsil status by government of Jammu and Kashmir on 1 February 2014. Etymology The word Srigufwara is a combination of two roots Sri and gufwara. The initial part sri, (Kashmiri, sun) is Sanskrit derived of the same name, means sun and gufwara (Kashmiri: gof: cave, wara: place) means place with a cave/secret. According to a legend, a famous Rishi Adityanand meditated here in a cave in the 11th century AD when there was sparse human habitation in the area. His secret communion with God resulted in his salvation. It is believed that the name of the place comes from this saint's presence here. During Islamic tyrannical reign it was called gofabal (gof=cave, bal=place) again meaning place with a cave. The meaning of old Kashmiri name Srigufwara was distorted to make it seemingly Arabic. Location Srigufwara is located on the banks of one and the only tributary of the Lidder River, near several villages such as Khairbug, Poshkreedi, Darigund and Hugam. It is 19 kilometers away from the main city Anantnag. Alternate route to famous health resort Pahalgam en route to famous Hindu Shrine Amarnath dedicated to the god Shiva, passes through Srigufwara. It serves as a shortcut to travel to Pahalgam. The drive is via Apple valley, vast landscapes, and lush green fields. Seventh century Martand sun temple on Martand plateau (Karewa) built by king Lalitaditya Muktapida of Kashmir is 10 kilometers away from Srigufwara. New administrative unit Local people and prominent political leaders have been demanding Tehsil status for the area from time to time. The decision for formation of new units was pending with the state government. On 1 February 2014, Srigufwara was given Tehsil status in District Anantnag after Jammu Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah agreed to the proposal for the creation of new administrative units in the state. Srigufwara is one among 135 newly created Tehsils after state cabinet accept the report submitted by the Cabinet Sub Committee (CSC) headed by Deputy Chief Minister Jammu Kashmir Tara Chand. The number of new administrative units recommended by CSC has been three times more than the Mushtaq Ganai Committee constituted by the Omar Abdullah government as it had recommended creation of only 57 Tehsils. Srigufwara acts as a nerve center for more than 100 revenue villages, which form its catchments area and get benefit largely. Srigufwara is one among the few fast evolving towns of south Kashmir having very important place in the rural economic distribution, development & activity. Geography Srigufwara is located at an elevation of 1684 meters above sea level. Lidder River passes through the town. It flows in a swift narrow stream from Sheeshnag lake to the east of Pahalgam. The Lidar passes through many villages. The area is abundant in small canals of different distances. There are minor rivers Mahind Canal and Dadi Canal, which serve the irrigation purpose in the area. Dadi canal initially covered less area but with remodeling the tail end irrigation has extended to 3,500 acres. The Dadi Canal takes its water from the Lidder River at Kathsu near Chatapura. It is 19 Kilometers long and irrigates about 8000 acres of land in Sakhras, Loiseer, Viddy, Darigund, Khiram, Bichhanpura and Sirhama. The Mahind Canal constructed in 1956 AD also takes it water from Lidder near village Sakhras. It is l6 Kilometers long and irrigates about 2500 acres of land. The area has deciduous vegetation and is abundant in coniferous forests including species like fir (Abies spectabilis), silver fir (Abies pindrow), kail (Pinus wallichiana), chir (Pinus roxburghii) and deodar (Cedrus deodara). There are numerous old chinar trees in the area particularly on roadsides. Other trees include willows and popular. Forest provides timber while as grassy meadows in the forest provide fodder for the cattle. Medicinal herbs such as digitalis, menthol, artemisia and belladonna, are also found in these forests. The soils are loamy with little clay and lime content but with a high content of magnesia. Chemical fertilization, green manure and legume is used before cultivation .There is sufficient organic matter and nitrogen content in the alluvium because of plant residue, crops stubble, natural vegetation and animal excretion. Soils types include Gurti (clay), Bahil (Loam) and Sekil (Sandy). Fruit cultivation is predominant slopes while paddy cultivation is common in planes. The area has a temperate climate as Pir Panjal Range of minor Himalayas surrounds it. In winter, however, snowfall is heavier and temperature is relatively low. Due to the presence of mountains, monsoons have a negligible effect in the area. The rainfall is often excessive in spring, moderate in summer, deficient in autumn and moderate in winter. In winters, the temperature may fall up to and in summers, the peak temperature is . Heavy rains and snowfall in winter poses a threat to the residential buildings in the area, which sometimes results in the collapse of the buildings. Fauna and Flora=Flora Apple and walnut are the prominent fruits grown in the area. Apple season starts from mid September and people sell the produce across various fruit Markets of the India especially the Jammu fruit market in the state itself. Apples are also used for extraction of pulp and juice for preparation of Jams and jellies. There are different varieties of apples grown like, ambri Kashmir (amri), American trail (American apirogue), delicious (red delicious), maharaji (white dotted red) hazaratbali (benoni) kesri (cox orange pipin). Other Fruits like pears, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots and almonds are also grown. The fruits are mostly cultivated for economic purpose and little for local consumption. Supply of machinery, equipment and technical advice to the fruit growers by the State Government has greatly helped fruit cultivation. The training of gardeners has helped fruit industry efficiently. The major shrubs are Indigofera heterantha, Viburnum spp., Sorbaria tomentosa etc. Ground cover is very rich and icotyledonus herbs dominate: Rumex patientia, Primula spp., and anemone spp. Fauna Local forests are the abode of black bear, brown bear, Leopard, rhesus macaque, grey langur, Himalayan mouse, hare and raven. Overa Biosphere Reserve The Overa-Aru Biosphere Reserve is 20 kilometers from the main town on Overa side. It has the status of a Wildlife sanctuary. It is famous for retaining several rare and endangered species like the hangul, musk deer, brown bear, leopard, koklas, monal and snow cock. Economy Agriculture and business are the main means of economy. This area is one of the major producers of fruit in Kashmir. Business sector is gaining prominence in the area and market economy is flourishing. And the town is developing at a greater pace. During earlier times, people used to obtained silk from silk worms, which feed on mulberry trees. Pure silk was obtained from silk cocoons by rough means without any technical expertise. The practice of silk production is nonexistent now. Now the people are more engaged with Apple and other business activities.srigufwara is one of the town in South Kashmir which is developing at faster pace in all aspects Leading Fruit Growers: Tarry Brothers Fruit Growers (since 1960) Transport The town has well-formed dual lane road connectivity with National Highway 1A (India) which is 10 kilometers away from the main town. During summers the number of tourist vehicles increases considerably giving a boost to the local economy. Major portions of pilgrims to Amarnath Temple also pass through the area. Demographics The population mostly consists of Muslims belonging to the ethnic group Kashmiri believed to have migrated from Central Asia and Afghanistan. Gurjar (gujjar) and Bakarwal (Bakerwal) also present in the upper area (nomadic people who come from rajori and other areas of jammu during summer, In general, they have nomadic character and largely depend on flocks and cattle keeping for their livelihood) . Most of the Gujjars are permanent settlers while as bakarwals stay in and around the area prior to their journeys to southern slopes of the Siwaliks and the Margs (Alpine-pastures) of the Central Himalayas. Shrine of Zain-ud-Din Wali The shrine of Sheikh Zain-ud-din wali who lived in the 15th century A.D is in the main town. Zainu Din was the disciple of Sheikh Noor-ud- din Wali, the leading Reshi of Kashmir. Various shrines are attributed to Zainu din Wali, including the famous shrine on a hillock in Ashmuqam about 20 kilometers from Pahalgam. However, the shrine in Srigufwara is important from the local belief that Zainu Din achieved spiritual perfection here. It is commonly known in Kashmir that Sheikh Zain-ud-din, who was known by the name of Zia Singh before his conversion to Islam was a prince and belonged to the ruling Rajas of Kishtwar. His father Yesh Singh, the then Kishtwar ruler, is said to have been assassinated when Zia Singh was only 13 years old. Zia Singh is believed to have been suffering from some disease. Once Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali passed through Kishtwar and Zia Singh's mother knowing about the art of his spiritual healing urged him to cure his son. Sheikh agreed on the condition that the Zia will have to meet him in Kashmir. However, after his cure he forgot the promise and again went bedridden. Remembering her promise mother and son took journey to meet Noor-ud-din and met him at Bumzu. It was at this place that both Zia Singh and his mother embraced Islam under the names of Zain-ud-din and Zoon Ded respectively. The exact date of the death of the saint is not known. However, his urs (anniversary) is celebrated on the 13th day of Basakh corresponding to 25 April. A torchlight procession, locally known as Zool (illumination), is held in the evenings during this festival. Pieces of forest wood especially deodar are tied to long wooden sticks and burnt. People of every age group participate in such processions. The shrine of Zain-ud-din is respected by all communities and they actively participate in the celebration of the anniversary. There is no restriction to the entry into the shrine, which is open to visits by persons of either sex and of any community. Government and politics Srigufwara is one of the major areas of political interest in Anantnag. Different political leaders organize their rallies in the area on different occasions. Addressing a rally on 28 April 2013 in the premises of higher Secondary School Srigufwara Peoples Democratic Party‚Äôs (PDP) Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said that Jammu & Kashmir will become the most developed state in the region if it gets a visionary political road map and efficient governance.

A Watali presided over the Police Public meet in which grievances related to PHE, Consumer affairs and other similar departments were addressed. Human rights Srigufwara has witnessed protests against human rights violations in the area and across the valley from time to time. In the earlier days of militancy in Kashmir, a BSF camp of Indian military positioned here, which was later replaced by Rashtriya Rifles (RR) forces. CRPF camp is still functional in the area. An Eidgah, which was under military occupation, was also opened to public service after 20 years of military occupation. In another incident a school headmaster Sonauaalh Ganie, of Bijbehara was taken up by 9 para commandoes of the camp and his relatives were not given access to meet him. In the heyday of militancy in Kashmir (1996), people who were reluctant to vote were forced to vote in elections by Indian forces.

It is managed by the Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. It has an Accident & Emergency Unit, a popular midwife-led Maternity unit, and an STD clinic known as the Wolverton Centre. History The hospital has its origins in a workhouse infirmary built in 1843. A larger infirmary was built to the southwest of the workhouse in 1868 and a nurses' home was built to the north of the workhouse in 1897. The infirmary was separated from the workhouse and was renamed the Kingston Infirmary in 1902. It became the Kingston and District Hospital in 1920 and a larger nurses' home was opened by the Duchess of York in 1928. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and began to redevelop the site the following year. A new out-patients department was opened by Princess Alexandra in 1963, a new medical centre was opened by Enoch Powell, Minister of Health in 1962 and Kenley Ward was opened by Professor Sir Max Rosenheim, President of the Royal College of Physicians, in 1969. The Esher Wing opened in 1976, the Bernard Meade Wing was opened by Princess Alexandra in 1992 and the Rowan Bentall Wing was opened, also by Princess Alexandra, in 1994. A new surgical centre was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in May 2004. The surgical centre, which was built by Costain at a cost of ¬£33 million, opened in June 2007. In June 2008, the Trust opened the Sir William Rous Unit, for those with cancer or concerned they might have cancer. The unit is run in partnership between, Kingston Hospital, the Royal Marsden Hospital and Macmillan Cancer Support so as to provide care for patients with cancer. Services The Combe Wing is a private patient unit on the site which was operated by BMI Healthcare but the contract was taken over by One Healthcare in 2018. Transport Kingston Hospital is close to Norbiton railway station and is on the A308. It is serviced by several bus routes (primarily from Kingston upon Thames).

In 1035, the Ghaznavid ruler Mas'ud I sent an army under Begtoghdi and Sahib Husain against the Seljuqs, who were stationing near Sarakhs. A battle shortly ensured, which resulted in the withdrawal of most of the Ghaznavid troops under Begtoghdi, while Sahib Husain continued to fight the Seljuqs, but was also defeated and was captured by the Seljuq Chaghri Beg. Sahib Husain later served as the vizier of the Seljuq ruler Tughril.

He received the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1887. He did graduate work at the University of Missouri and in Germany. In 1892, Dr. Cary taught the first veterinary science course at the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College, now Auburn University. In 1893, he was appointed professor of physiology and veterinary science, as well as experiment station veterinarian. In both capacities, he was remembered as a dynamic teacher. He became Alabama's first State Veterinarian in 1905, during which time he led in establishing meat and dairy inspection laws. In 1907, he was named Dean of the new College of Veterinary Medicine at Auburn, the first such school in the South. He held that position until his death in 1935. Dr. Cary was President of the Alabama Veterinary Association, the Alabama Livestock Association, and the United States Livestock Sanitary Association. His campaigns to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and Texas tick fever were among the many accomplishments that led to his recognition as the Father of Veterinary Medicine in the South. In 1957, he was elected to the Alabama Hall of Fame. At the first Charles Allen Cary Lecture given at Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, January 27, 1992, Dr. Charles W. Schwabe from the University of California at Davis, said: \\"I can think of no other veterinarian who more profoundly influenced through his professional lifetime, the health and well being of a whole region of this country than Charles Allen Cary.\\" Charles Allen Cary was inducted into the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in 1992. He was married to Emma Heck Cary, with whom he had three children.

Brucellosis and tuberculosis testing were furthered by his research and practical applications. When farmers sought hog cholera serum at low prices, Cary used his influence to establish a plant at Auburn to make it. His Saturday clinics and summer institutes taught farmers about the prevention and treatment of diseases of animals. In 1896 he helped to establish at Montgomery the first meat inspection system in the United States, following that up with meat and milk inspection ordinances in all major Alabama cities. Through his efforts the first school of veterinary science in the South was established at Auburn and he served as dean of that school for 28 years. The veterinary science building on the campus now bears his name.http://www.archives.alabama.gov/famous/c_cary.html References Category:1861 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Iowa Category:Iowa State University alumni Category:American veterinarians Category:Male veterinarians ","title":"Charles Allen Cary"},{"id":"41890839","text":"Gaylussacia nana, the dwarf dangleberry or Confederate huckleberry, is a plant species native to the coastal plains of the southeastern United States.

Background Since the late 2000s, there was a trend of producing purely entertainment programmes in various satellite television channels in China. Examples included Super Girl, Fei Cheng Wu Rao (If You Are The One), Day Day Up, Happy Camp, China's Got Talent, etc. SAPPRFT, being responsible for the supervision of state-owned enterprises engaged in the television, radio, and film industries, is of the opinions that the satellite TV channels in China focus too much on purely entertainment programmes and are hence creating drawbacks on public opinions, and thus would like to impose a stricter control on the content of the programmes broadcast in the satellites TV channels. Directive The policy was announced in 2011 and imposed in 2012. The targets of the policy are only those satellite TV channels, not including CCTV and non-satellite provincial TV channels. SAPPRFT focused on the following seven genres of programmes: * Dating game show * Talent show * Variety show about love stories * Game show * General variety show * Talk show * Reality television SAPPRFT required that there should not be more than nine programmes of the above genres from 19:30 to 22:00 every day in all satellite TV channels as a whole, and each channel should not broadcast more than 2 programmes of the above genres every week and not more than 90 minutes every day. SAPPRFT also demanded the satellite TV channels increase the proportion of documentary programmes, news programmes, educational programmes, programmes for children and youth, and also programmes about economic issues and science. SAPPRFT also impose a policy requiring the TV channels to limit the participation of actors coming from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Effects The policy had a great impact on those TV channels that had been focusing on producing entertainment programmes, among which included Hunan Television (ÊπñÂçóÂç´ËßÜ), Dragon Television (Êù±ÊñπÂç´ËßÜ), Jiangsu Television (Ê±üËãèÂç´ËßÜ), Zhejiang Television (ÊµôÊ±üÂç´ËßÜ), Shenzhen Satellite TV (Ê∑±Âú≥Âç´ËßÜ). Some of the programmes that had been planned needed to be suspended. For those others satellite TV channels that had not been focusing on entertainment programmes, the policy did not have a very large impact.
