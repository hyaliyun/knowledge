Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Boston Globe, often classify editorials under the heading \\"opinion\\". Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of editorial cartoons. Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on. Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name think pieces) by writers not directly affiliated with the publication. However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Denmark, Spain, Italy, and France. Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. Tom Clark, leader-writer for The Guardian, says that it ensures that readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author. On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility. When The Press, a New Zealand newspaper based in Christchurch, changed after 157 years from broadsheet to compact in 2018, they published a list of editorials where current thinking differs from opinions expressed at the time. The starkest example was their view on women's suffrage in New Zealand after the government gave women the vote in 1893, where the editorial proclaimed that women would \\"much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties\\" than going to the polling booths. In the field of fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to photo-editorials ‚Äì features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.

In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras's theorem, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. This theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the \\"Pythagorean equation\\": :a^2 + b^2 = c^2 , where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b the lengths of the triangle's other two sides. The theorem, whose history is the subject of much debate, is named for the ancient Greek thinker Pythagoras. The theorem has been given numerous proofspossibly the most for any mathematical theorem. They are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but n-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound. Rearrangement proof The rearrangement proof (click to view animation)The two large squares shown in the figure each contain four identical triangles, and the only difference between the two large squares is that the triangles are arranged differently. Therefore, the white space within each of the two large squares must have equal area. Equating the area of the white space yields the Pythagorean theorem, Q.E.D.Benson, Donald. The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies, pp. 172‚Äì173 (Oxford University Press, 1999). Heath gives this proof in his commentary on Proposition I.47 in Euclid's Elements, and mentions the proposals of Bretschneider and Hankel that Pythagoras may have known this proof. Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion \\"that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him.\\", pp. 351‚Äì352 Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues., \\"It should now be clear that decisions about sources are crucial in addressing the question of whether Pythagoras was a mathematician and scientist. The view of Pythagoras's cosmos sketched in the first five paragraphs of this section, according to which he was neither a mathematician nor a scientist, remains the consensus.\\" Other forms of the theorem If c denotes the length of the hypotenuse and a and b denote the lengths of the other two sides, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation: : a^2 + b^2 = c^2 . If the lengths of both a and b are known, then c can be calculated as : c = \\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. If the length of the hypotenuse c and of one side (a or b) are known, then the length of the other side can be calculated as : a = \\\\sqrt{c^2 - b^2} or : b = \\\\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. The Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum. A generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines, which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them. If the angle between the other sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation. Other proofs of the theorem This theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of quadratic reciprocity being another contender for that distinction); the book The Pythagorean Proposition contains 370 proofs. Proof using similar triangles Proof using similar triangles This proof is based on the proportionality of the sides of two similar triangles, that is, upon the fact that the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles. Let ABC represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at C, as shown on the figure. Draw the altitude from point C, and call H its intersection with the side AB. Point H divides the length of the hypotenuse c into parts d and e. The new triangle ACH is similar to triangle ABC, because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at A, meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as Œ∏ in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle CBH is also similar to ABC. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the triangle postulate: The sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the parallel postulate. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides: : \\\\frac{BC}{AB}=\\\\frac{BH}{BC} \\\\text{ and } \\\\frac{AC}{AB}=\\\\frac{AH}{AC}. The first result equates the cosines of the angles Œ∏, whereas the second result equates their sines. These ratios can be written as :BC^2 = AB \\\\times BH \\\\text{ and } AC^2=AB \\\\times AH. Summing these two equalities results in :BC^2+AC^2=AB\\\\times BH+AB\\\\times AH=AB\\\\times(AH+BH)=AB^2 , which, after simplification, expresses the Pythagorean theorem: :BC^2+AC^2=AB^2 \\\\ . The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the Elements, and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time. This proof first appeared after a computer program was set to check Euclidean proofs. Euclid's proof Proof in Euclid's Elements In outline, here is how the proof in Euclid's Elements proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be congruent, proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow. Let A, B, C be the vertices of a right triangle, with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs. For the formal proof, we require four elementary lemmata: # If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent (side-angle-side). # The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude. # The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides. # The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3). Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.See for example Pythagorean theorem by shear mapping , Saint Louis University website Java applet Illustration including the new lines Showing the two congruent triangles of half the area of rectangle BDLK and square BAGF The proof is as follows: #Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB. #On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate. #From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively. #Join CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA. #Angles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are collinear. Similarly for B, A, and H. #Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC. #Since AB is equal to FB and BD is equal to BC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC. #Since A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2) #Since C is collinear with A and G, square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC. #Therefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB2. #Similarly, it can be shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC2. #Adding these two results, AB2 \\\\+ AC2 = BD √ó BK + KL √ó KC #Since BD = KL, BD √ó BK + KL √ó KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD √ó BC #Therefore, AB2 \\\\+ AC2 = BC2, since CBDE is a square. This proof, which appears in Euclid's Elements as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1,Elements 1.47 by Euclid. Retrieved 19 December 2006. demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares. Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 47: web page version using Java applets from Euclid's Elements by Prof. David E. Joyce, Clark University This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used.The proof by Pythagoras probably was not a general one, as the theory of proportions was developed only two centuries after Pythagoras; see Proofs by dissection and rearrangement We have already discussed the Pythagorean proof, which was a proof by rearrangement. The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side , containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares a2 and b2 uncovered, the second of which leaves square c2 uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore A second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area c2, from four identical right triangles with sides a, b and c, fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2, which must have the same area as the initial large square. The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse ‚Äì or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called dissection. This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones. {Animation showing proof by rearrangement of four identical right triangles  Animation showing another proof by rearrangement  Proof using an elaborate rearrangement } Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement Right triangle on the hypotenuse dissected into two similar right triangles on the legs, according to Einstein's proof Albert Einstein gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces need not get moved. Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two similar shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see Similar figures on the three sides). In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself. The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts. Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle. Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well. Algebraic proofs Diagram of the two algebraic proofs The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides a, b and c, arranged inside a square with side c as in the top half of the diagram. The triangles are similar with area \\\\tfrac12ab, while the small square has side and area . The area of the large square is therefore :(b-a)^2+4\\\\frac{ab}{2} = (b-a)^2+2ab = b^2-2ab+a^2+2ab = a^2+b^2. But this is a square with side c and area c2, so :c^2 = a^2 + b^2. A similar proof uses four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side c, as shown in the lower part of the diagram. This results in a larger square, with side and area . The four triangles and the square side c must have the same area as the larger square, :(b+a)^2 = c^2 + 4\\\\frac{ab}{2} = c^2+2ab, giving :c^2 = (b+a)^2 - 2ab = b^2+2ab+a^2-2ab = a^2 + b^2. Diagram of Garfield's proof A related proof was published by future U.S. President James A. Garfield (then a U.S. Representative) (see diagram). Published in a weekly mathematics column: as noted in and in A calendar of mathematical dates: April 1, 1876 by V. Frederick Rickey Maor, Eli, The Pythagorean Theorem, Princeton University Press, 2007: pp. 106-107. Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid, which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square, to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram. The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is :\\\\frac{1}{2}(b+a)^2. The inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of \\\\frac{1}{2}, which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result. Proof using differentials One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing calculus. The triangle ABC is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with BC the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length y, the side AC of length x and the side AB of length a, as seen in the lower diagram part. Diagram for differential proof If x is increased by a small amount dx by extending the side AC slightly to D, then y also increases by dy. These form two sides of a triangle, CDE, which (with E chosen so CE is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to ABC. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is: : \\\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\\\frac xy. This can be rewritten as y \\\\, dy=x \\\\, dx , which is a differential equation that can be solved by direct integration: :\\\\int y \\\\, dy=\\\\int x \\\\, dx\\\\,, giving :y^2=x^2+C. The constant can be deduced from x = 0, y = a to give the equation :y^2 = x^2 + a^2. This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of dx and dy. Converse The converse of the theorem is also true: > For any three positive numbers a, b, and c such that , there exists a > triangle with sides a, b and c, and every such triangle has a right angle > between the sides of lengths a and b. An alternative statement is: > For any triangle with sides a, b, c, if then the angle between a and b > measures 90¬∞. This converse also appears in Euclid's Elements (Book I, Proposition 48): Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 48 From D.E. Joyce's web page at Clark University It can be proven using the law of cosines or as follows: Let ABC be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, with Construct a second triangle with sides of length a and b containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length c = , the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths a, b and c, the triangles are congruent and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths a and b in the original triangle is a right angle. The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proven without assuming the Pythagorean theorem.Casey, Stephen, \\"The converse of the theorem of Pythagoras\\", Mathematical Gazette 92, July 2008, 309‚Äì313.Mitchell, Douglas W., \\"Feedback on 92.47\\", Mathematical Gazette 93, March 2009, 156. A corollary of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let c be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and (otherwise there is no triangle according to the triangle inequality). The following statements apply: * If then the triangle is right. * If then the triangle is acute. * If then the triangle is obtuse. Edsger W. Dijkstra has stated this proposition about acute, right, and obtuse triangles in this language: : where Œ± is the angle opposite to side a, Œ≤ is the angle opposite to side b, Œ≥ is the angle opposite to side c, and sgn is the sign function. Consequences and uses of the theorem=Pythagorean triples A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b, and c, such that In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths. Such a triple is commonly written Some well-known examples are and A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime (the greatest common divisor of a, b and c is 1). The following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100: :(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97) Reciprocal Pythagorean theorem Given a right triangle with sides a,b,c and altitude d (a line from the right angle and perpendicular to the hypotenuse c). The Pythagorean theorem has, :a^2+b^2 = c^2 while the reciprocal Pythagorean theoremR. B.

If the a,b,d are to be integers, the smallest solution a>b>d is then :\\\\frac1{20^2}+\\\\frac1{15^2} = \\\\frac1{12^2} using the smallest Pythagorean triple 3,4,5. The reciprocal Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the optic equation :\\\\frac1{p}+\\\\frac1{q} = \\\\frac1{r} where the denominators are squares and also for a heptagonal triangle whose sides p,q,r are square numbers. Incommensurable lengths The spiral of Theodorus: A construction for line segments with lengths whose ratios are the square root of a positive integer One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are incommensurable (so the ratio of which is not a rational number) can be constructed using a straightedge and compass. Pythagoras's theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the square root operation. The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer. Each triangle has a side (labeled \\"1\\") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras's theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as , , . For more detail, see Quadratic irrational. Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit. According to one legend, Hippasus of Metapontum (ca. 470 B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable. ; Hippasus was on a voyage at the time, and his fellows cast him overboard. See A careful discussion of Hippasus's contributions is found in Complex numbers The absolute value of a complex number z is the distance r from z to the origin For any complex number :z = x + iy, the absolute value or modulus is given by :r = z=\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. So the three quantities, r, x and y are related by the Pythagorean equation, :r^2 = x^2 + y^2. Note that r is defined to be a positive number or zero but x and y can be negative as well as positive. Geometrically r is the distance of the z from zero or the origin O in the complex plane. This can be generalised to find the distance between two points, z1 and z2 say. The required distance is given by :z_1 - z_2=\\\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}, so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation, :z_1 - z_2^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2. Euclidean distance The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. If and are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by : \\\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}. More generally, in Euclidean n-space, the Euclidean distance between two points, A\\\\,=\\\\,(a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_n) and B\\\\,=\\\\,(b_1,b_2,\\\\dots,b_n), is defined, by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, as: :\\\\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \\\\cdots + (a_n- b_n)^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2}. If instead of Euclidean distance, the square of this value (the squared Euclidean distance, or SED) is used, the resulting equation avoids square roots and is simply a sum of the SED of the coordinates: :(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \\\\cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2. The squared form is a smooth, convex function of both points, and is widely used in optimization theory and statistics, forming the basis of least squares. In information geometry, more general notions of statistical distance, known as divergences, are used, and the Pythagorean identity can be generalized to Bregman divergences, allowing general forms of least squares to be used to solve non-linear problems. Euclidean distance in other coordinate systems If Cartesian coordinates are not used, for example, if polar coordinates are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if curvilinear coordinates are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the applications of Legendre polynomials in physics. The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras's theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates can be introduced as: : x = r \\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\ y = r \\\\sin \\\\theta. Then two points with locations and are separated by a distance s: :s^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 = (r_1 \\\\cos \\\\theta_1 -r_2 \\\\cos \\\\theta_2 )^2 + (r_1 \\\\sin \\\\theta_1 -r_2 \\\\sin \\\\theta_2)^2. Performing the squares and combining terms, the Pythagorean formula for distance in Cartesian coordinates produces the separation in polar coordinates as: :\\\\begin{align}s^2 &= r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \\\\left( \\\\cos \\\\theta_1 \\\\cos \\\\theta_2 +\\\\sin \\\\theta_1 \\\\sin \\\\theta_2 \\\\right)\\\\ &= r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\theta_1 - \\\\theta_2\\\\right)\\\\ &=r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \\\\cos \\\\Delta \\\\theta, \\\\end{align} using the trigonometric product-to-sum formulas. This formula is the law of cosines, sometimes called the generalized Pythagorean theorem., Exercises, page 116 From this result, for the case where the radii to the two locations are at right angles, the enclosed angle and the form corresponding to Pythagoras's theorem is regained: s^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2. The Pythagorean theorem, valid for right triangles, therefore is a special case of the more general law of cosines, valid for arbitrary triangles. Pythagorean trigonometric identity Similar right triangles showing sine and cosine of angle Œ∏ In a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse c, trigonometry determines the sine and cosine of the angle Œ∏ between side a and the hypotenuse as: :\\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac{b}{c}, \\\\quad \\\\cos \\\\theta = \\\\frac{a}{c}. From that it follows: : {\\\\cos}^2 \\\\theta + {\\\\sin}^2 \\\\theta = \\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2} = 1, where the last step applies Pythagoras's theorem. This relation between sine and cosine is sometimes called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity. In similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles, and depend upon the angles. Consequently, in the figure, the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin Œ∏ and adjacent side of size cos Œ∏ in units of the hypotenuse. Relation to the cross product The area of a parallelogram as a cross product; vectors a and b identify a plane and is normal to this plane. The Pythagorean theorem relates the cross product and dot product in a similar way: : mathbf{a} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\^2 + (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b})^2 = mathbf{a}\\\\^2 mathbf{b}\\\\^2. This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product, as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{b} &= ab \\\\mathbf{n} \\\\sin{\\\\theta} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b} &= ab \\\\cos{\\\\theta}, \\\\end{align} with n a unit vector normal to both a and b. The relationship follows from these definitions and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity. This can also be used to define the cross product. By rearranging the following equation is obtained : mathbf{a} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\^2 = mathbf{a}\\\\^2 mathbf{b}\\\\^2 - (\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b})^2. This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition, for example in seven dimensions. Generalizations=Similar figures on the three sides A generalization of the Pythagorean theorem extending beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to similar figures was known by Hippocrates of Chios in the 5th century BC,Heath, T. L., A History of Greek Mathematics, Oxford University Press, 1921; reprinted by Dover, 1981. and was included by Euclid in his Elements:Euclid's Elements: Book VI, Proposition VI 31: \\"In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle.\\" > If one erects similar figures (see Euclidean geometry) with corresponding > sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the > ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side. This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are a:b:c).Putz, John F. and Sipka, Timothy A. \\"On generalizing the Pythagorean theorem\\", The College Mathematics Journal 34 (4), September 2003, pp. 291‚Äì295. While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle). The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas A, B and C are erected on sides with corresponding lengths a, b and c then: :\\\\frac{A}{a^2} = \\\\frac{B}{b^2} = \\\\frac{C}{c^2}\\\\, , :\\\\Rightarrow A + B = \\\\frac{a^2}{c^2}C + \\\\frac{b^2}{c^2}C\\\\, . But, by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 \\\\+ b2 = c2, so A + B = C. Conversely, if we can prove that A + B = C for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle C on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (A and B ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its altitude. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus A + B = C and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a2 \\\\+ b2 = c2.

At any selected angle of a general triangle of sides a, b, c, inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base Œ∏ are the same as the selected angle. Suppose the selected angle Œ∏ is opposite the side labeled c. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle CAD with angle Œ∏ opposite side b and with side r along c. A second triangle is formed with angle Œ∏ opposite side a and a side with length s along c, as shown in the figure. ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as: : a^2 +b^2 =c(r+s) \\\\ . As the angle Œ∏ approaches /2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths r and s overlap less and less. When Œ∏ = /2, ADB becomes a right triangle, r + s = c, and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained. One proof observes that triangle ABC has the same angles as triangle CAD, but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex B, both contain the angle Œ∏, and so also have the same third angle by the triangle postulate.) Consequently, ABC is similar to the reflection of CAD, the triangle DAC in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to Œ∏, :\\\\frac{c}{b} = \\\\frac{b}{r} \\\\ . Likewise, for the reflection of the other triangle, :\\\\frac{c}{a} = \\\\frac{a}{s} \\\\ . Clearing fractions and adding these two relations: : cs + cr = a^2 +b^2 \\\\ , the required result. The theorem remains valid if the angle \\\\theta is obtuse so the lengths r and s are non- overlapping. General triangles using parallelograms Generalization for arbitrary triangles, green area Construction for proof of parallelogram generalization Pappus's area theorem is a further generalization, that applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares (squares are a special case, of course). The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras's theorem, and was considered a generalization by Pappus of Alexandria in 4 ADFor the details of such a construction, see Claudi Alsina, Roger B. Nelsen: Charming Proofs: A Journey Into Elegant Mathematics. MAA, 2010, , pp. 77‚Äì78 () The lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base b and height h. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms. Solid geometry Pythagoras's theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides. A tetrahedron with outward facing right-angle corner In terms of solid geometry, Pythagoras's theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure. The length of diagonal BD is found from Pythagoras's theorem as: : \\\\overline{BD}^{\\\\,2} = \\\\overline{BC}^{\\\\,2} + \\\\overline{CD}^{\\\\,2} \\\\ , where these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal BD and the vertical edge AB, the length of diagonal AD then is found by a second application of Pythagoras's theorem as: : \\\\overline{AD}^{\\\\,2} = \\\\overline{AB}^{\\\\,2} + \\\\overline{BD}^{\\\\,2} \\\\ , or, doing it all in one step: : \\\\overline{AD}^{\\\\,2} = \\\\overline{AB}^{\\\\,2} + \\\\overline{BC}^{\\\\,2} + \\\\overline{CD}^{\\\\,2} \\\\ . This result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector v (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {vk} (the three mutually perpendicular sides): :mathbf{v}\\\\^2 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^3 mathbf{v}_k\\\\^2. This one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras's theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes. A substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is de Gua's theorem, named for Jean Paul de Gua de Malves: If a tetrahedron has a right angle corner (like a corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the \\"n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem\\": This statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The \\"hypotenuse\\" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the \\"legs\\" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the \\"legs\\" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras's theorem applies. In a different wording: For an extended discussion of this generalization, see, for example, Willie W. Wong 2002, A generalized n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem. Inner product spaces Vectors involved in the parallelogram law The Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to inner product spaces, which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces. For example, a function may be considered as a vector with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in functional analysis. In an inner product space, the concept of perpendicularity is replaced by the concept of orthogonality: two vectors v and w are orthogonal if their inner product \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v} , \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\rangle is zero. The inner product is a generalization of the dot product of vectors. The dot product is called the standard inner product or the Euclidean inner product. However, other inner products are possible. The concept of length is replaced by the concept of the norm v of a vector v, defined as: :\\\\lVert \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\rVert \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\rangle} \\\\, . In an inner-product space, the Pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors v and w we have :\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\right\\\\^2 = \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right\\\\^2 + \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\right\\\\^2 . Here the vectors v and w are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the vector sum v + w. This form of the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the properties of the inner product: :\\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\right\\\\^2 =\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{ v+w},\\\\ \\\\mathbf{ v+w}\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{ v},\\\\ \\\\mathbf{ v}\\\\rangle +\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{ w},\\\\ \\\\mathbf{ w}\\\\rangle +\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{ v,\\\\ w }\\\\rangle + \\\\langle\\\\mathbf{ w,\\\\ v }\\\\rangle \\\\ = \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right\\\\^2 + \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\right\\\\^2, where the inner products of the cross terms are zero, because of orthogonality. A further generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in an inner product space to non-orthogonal vectors is the parallelogram law : :2mathbf v\\\\^2 +2 mathbf w\\\\^2 = mathbf {v + w} \\\\^2 +\\\\ \\\\mathbf{v-w}\\\\^2 \\\\ , which says that twice the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Any norm that satisfies this equality is ipso facto a norm corresponding to an inner product. The Pythagorean identity can be extended to sums of more than two orthogonal vectors. If v1, v2, ..., vn are pairwise-orthogonal vectors in an inner-product space, then application of the Pythagorean theorem to successive pairs of these vectors (as described for 3-dimensions in the section on solid geometry) results in the equation :\\\\leftsum_{k=1}^n\\\\mathbf{v}_k\\\\right\\\\^2=\\\\sum_{k=1}^nmathbf{v}_k\\\\^2 Sets of m-dimensional objects in n-dimensional space Another generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applies to Lebesgue-measurable sets of objects in any number of dimensions. Specifically, the square of the measure of an m-dimensional set of objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional flats in n-dimensional Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the orthogonal projections of the object(s) onto all m-dimensional coordinate subspaces. In mathematical terms: :\\\\mu^2_{ms} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{x}\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu^2}_{mp_i} where: * \\\\mu_m is a measure in m-dimensions (a length in one dimension, an area in two dimensions, a volume in three dimensions, etc.). * s is a set of one or more non-overlapping m-dimensional objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional flats in n-dimensional Euclidean space. * \\\\mu_{ms} is the total measure (sum) of the set of m-dimensional objects. * p represents an m-dimensional projection of the original set onto an orthogonal coordinate subspace. * \\\\mu_{mp_i} is the measure of the m-dimensional set projection onto m-dimensional coordinate subspace i. Because object projections can overlap on a coordinate subspace, the measure of each object projection in the set must be calculated individually, then measures of all projections added together to provide the total measure for the set of projections on the given coordinate subspace. * x is the number of orthogonal, m-dimensional coordinate subspaces in n-dimensional space () onto which the m-dimensional objects are projected (m ‚â§ n): :: x = \\\\binom{n}{m} = \\\\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!} Non-Euclidean geometry The Pythagorean theorem is derived from the axioms of Euclidean geometry, and in fact, were the Pythagorean theorem to fail for some right triangle, then the plane in which this triangle is contained cannot be Euclidean. More precisely, the Pythagorean theorem implies, and is implied by, Euclid's Parallel (Fifth) Postulate. Thus, right triangles in a non-Euclidean geometry do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in spherical geometry, all three sides of the right triangle (say a, b, and c) bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to /2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because a^2 + b^2 = 2 c^2 > c^2 . Here two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered‚Äîspherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines. However, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say A+B = C. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters a and b equals the area of the circle with diameter c. =Spherical geometry= Spherical triangle For any right triangle on a sphere of radius R (for example, if Œ≥ in the figure is a right angle), with sides a, b, c, the relation between the sides takes the form: : \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{R}\\\\right)=\\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{R}\\\\right)\\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R}\\\\right). This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines that applies to all spherical triangles: : \\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{R}\\\\right)=\\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{R}\\\\right)\\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R}\\\\right) +\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{R}\\\\right) \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R}\\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\gamma \\\\ . By expressing the Maclaurin series for the cosine function as an asymptotic expansion with the remainder term in big O notation, : \\\\cos x = 1 - \\\\frac{x^2}{2} + O(x^4) \\\\text{ as } x \\\\to 0\\\\ , it can be shown that as the radius R approaches infinity and the arguments a/R, b/R, and c/R tend to zero, the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle approaches the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. Substituting the asymptotic expansion for each of the cosines into the spherical relation for a right triangle yields :1-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{R}\\\\right)^2 + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R^4}\\\\right) = \\\\left[1-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{R}\\\\right)^2 + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R^4}\\\\right) \\\\right]\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R}\\\\right)^2 + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R^4}\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\text{ as }R\\\\to\\\\infty\\\\ . The constants a4, b4, and c4 have been absorbed into the big O remainder terms since they are independent of the radius R. This asymptotic relationship can be further simplified by multiplying out the bracketed quantities, cancelling the ones, multiplying through by ‚àí2, and collecting all the error terms together: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{R}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{R}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R}\\\\right)^2 + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R^4}\\\\right)\\\\text{ as }R\\\\to\\\\infty\\\\ . After multiplying through by R2, the Euclidean Pythagorean relationship c2 = a2 \\\\+ b2 is recovered in the limit as the radius R approaches infinity (since the remainder term tends to zero): :c^2= a^2 + b^2 + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R^2}\\\\right)\\\\text{ as }R\\\\to\\\\infty\\\\ . For small right triangles (a, b << R), the cosines can be eliminated to avoid loss of significance, giving : \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{c}{2R} = \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{a}{2R} + \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{b}{2R} - 2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{a}{2R} \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{b}{2R} \\\\,. =Hyperbolic geometry= Hyperbolic triangle In a hyperbolic space with uniform curvature ‚àí1/R2, for a right triangle with legs a, b, and hypotenuse c, the relation between the sides takes the form: : \\\\cosh \\\\frac{c}{R} = \\\\cosh \\\\frac{a}{R} \\\\, \\\\cosh \\\\frac{b}{R} where cosh is the hyperbolic cosine. This formula is a special form of the hyperbolic law of cosines that applies to all hyperbolic triangles: :\\\\cosh \\\\frac{c}{R} = \\\\cosh \\\\frac{a}{R} \\\\ \\\\cosh \\\\frac{b}{R} - \\\\sinh \\\\frac{a}{R} \\\\ \\\\sinh \\\\frac{b}{R} \\\\ \\\\cos \\\\gamma \\\\ , with Œ≥ the angle at the vertex opposite the side c. By using the Maclaurin series for the hyperbolic cosine, , it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small (that is, as a, b, and c all approach zero), the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras's theorem. For small right triangles (a, b << R), the hyperbolic cosines can be eliminated to avoid loss of significance, giving : \\\\sinh^2 \\\\frac{c}{2R} = \\\\sinh^2 \\\\frac{a}{2R} + \\\\sinh^2 \\\\frac{b}{2R} + 2 \\\\sinh^2 \\\\frac{a}{2R} \\\\sinh^2 \\\\frac{b}{2R} \\\\,. =Very small triangles= For any uniform curvature K (positive, zero, or negative), in very small right triangles (Ka2, Kb2 << 1) with hypotenuse c, it can be shown that : c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - \\\\frac{K}{3} a^2 b^2 - \\\\frac{K^2}{45} a^2 b^2 (a^2 + b^2) - \\\\frac{2 K^3}{945} a^2 b^2 (a^2 - b^2)^2 + O (K^4 c^{10}) \\\\,. Differential geometry Distance between infinitesimally separated points in Cartesian coordinates (top) and polar coordinates (bottom), as given by Pythagoras's theorem On an infinitesimal level, in three dimensional space, Pythagoras's theorem describes the distance between two infinitesimally separated points as: :ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 +dz^2, with ds the element of distance and (dx, dy, dz) the components of the vector separating the two points. Such a space is called a Euclidean space. However, in Riemannian geometry, a generalization of this expression useful for general coordinates (not just Cartesian) and general spaces (not just Euclidean) takes the form: :ds^2 = \\\\sum_{i,j}^n g_{ij}\\\\, dx_i\\\\, dx_j which is called the metric tensor. (Sometimes, by abuse of language, the same term is applied to the set of coefficients .) It may be a function of position, and often describes curved space. A simple example is Euclidean (flat) space expressed in curvilinear coordinates. For example, in polar coordinates: :ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\\\theta^2 \\\\ . History Plimpton 322 tablet records Pythagorean triples from Babylonian times.. There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once, or many times in many places, and the date of first discovery is uncertain, as is the date of the first proof. Historians of Mesopotamian mathematics have concluded that the Pythagorean rule was in widespread use during the Old Babylonian period (20th to 16th centuries BC), over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born.: p. 36 \\"In other words it was known during the whole duration of Babylonian mathematics that the sum of the squares on the lengths of the sides of a right triangle equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse.\\": p. 306 \\"Although Plimpton 322 is a unique text of its kind, there are several other known texts testifying that the Pythagorean theorem was well known to the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period.\\", p. 406, \\"To judge from this evidence alone it is therefore likely that the Pythagorean rule was discovered within the lay surveyors‚Äô environment, possibly as a spin-off from the problem treated in Db2-146, somewhere between 2300 and 1825 BC.\\" (Db2-146 is an Old Babylonian clay tablet from Eshnunna concerning the computation of the sides of a rectangle given its area and diagonal.): p. 109 \\"Many Old Babylonian mathematical practitioners ‚Ä¶ knew that the square on the diagonal of a right triangle had the same area as the sum of the squares on the length and width: that relationship is used in the worked solutions to word problems on cut-and-paste ‚Äòalgebra‚Äô on seven different tablets, from E≈°nuna, Sippar, Susa, and an unknown location in southern Babylonia.\\" The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system. Written between 2000 and 1786 BC, the Middle Kingdom Egyptian Berlin Papyrus 6619 includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet Plimpton 322, written between 1790 and 1750 BC during the reign of Hammurabi the Great, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples. In India, the Baudhayana Shulba Sutra, the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples and a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, both in the special case of the isosceles right triangle and in the general case, as does the Apastamba Shulba Sutra (c. 600 BC). Van der Waerden believed that this material \\"was certainly based on earlier traditions\\". Carl Boyer states that the Pythagorean theorem in the ≈öulba-s≈©tram may have been influenced by ancient Mesopotamian math, but there is no conclusive evidence in favor or opposition of this possibility. Proclus, writing in the fifth century AD, states two arithmetic rules, \\"one of them attributed to Plato, the other to Pythagoras\\", for generating special Pythagorean triples. The rule attributed to Pythagoras () starts from an odd number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by one unit; the rule attributed to Plato (428/427 or 424/423 ‚Äì 348/347 BC)) starts from an even number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by two units. According to Thomas L. Heath (1861‚Äì1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. page 351 However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted.: \\"Though this is the proposition universally associated by tradition with the name of Pythagoras, no really trustworthy evidence exists that it was actually discovered by him. The comparatively late writers who attribute it to him add the story that he sacrificed an ox to celebrate his discovery.\\" An extensive discussion of the historical evidence is provided in page=351 \\"Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, [...] one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics.\\" Around 300 BC, in Euclid's Elements, the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented. Geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem from the Zhoubi Suanjing. With contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the Chinese text Zhoubi Suanjing (Âë®È´ÄÁÆóÁªè), (The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven) gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle‚Äîin China it is called the \\"Gougu theorem\\" (ÂãæËÇ°ÂÆöÁêÜ). A rather extensive discussion of the origins of the various texts in the Zhou Bi is provided by During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, This work is a compilation of 246 problems, some of which survived the book burning of 213 BC, and was put in final form before 100 AD. It was extensively commented upon by Liu Hui in 263 AD. See particularly ¬ß3: Nine chapters on the mathematical art, pp. 71 ff. together with a mention of right triangles. Some believe the theorem arose first in China, In particular, Li Jimin; see where it is alternatively known as the \\"Shang Gao theorem\\" (ÂïÜÈ´òÂÆöÁêÜ), named after the Duke of Zhou's astronomer and mathematician, whose reasoning composed most of what was in the Zhoubi Suanjing.

Joining the RAAF in 1951, he flew Gloster Meteor jets with No. 77 Squadron in the Korean War in 1953, and subsequently de Havilland Vampires with No. 78 Wing on garrison duty in Malta. From 1958 to 1960, he served with No. 3 Squadron, operating CAC Sabres during the Malayan Emergency. He took charge of No. 3 Squadron in 1967, when it re-equipped with the Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighter. His commands in the early 1970s included the Aircraft Research and Development Unit, RAAF Base Laverton, and No. 82 Wing, the last-mentioned during its first years operating the long-delayed General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber. He was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in March 1984, and CAS in May the following year. His tenure as CAS coincided with the release of the Dibb Report on Australia's defence capabilities, and the controversial transfer of the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army. Newham retired from the Air Force in July 1987 and became a company director. Early career John William Newham, known as \\"Jake\\", was born in Cowra, New South Wales, and educated at Cowra High School. After matriculating, he worked as a clerk in the Commonwealth Bank, and joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in February 1951.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 174‚Äì176 He underwent flying training at RAAF Base Point Cook, Victoria, and graduated as a sergeant pilot in July 1952. Following fighter training, he saw operational service in the Korean War, flying Gloster Meteor jets with No. 77 Squadron from February to September 1953.Singh, Who's Who in Australia 2010 He later recalled that his first sortie was as wingman to a Royal Air Force flight lieutenant: \\"We flew up past P'yongyang and he showed me enemy gun locations by arranging for them to shoot at us\\".Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 65 Having been commissioned as a pilot officer midway through his Korean service, Newham's next posting was with No. 78 (Fighter) Wing on Malta, where he flew de Havilland Vampires until 1955. The wing had been on garrison duty in Malta since July 1952, and Newham was one of five Korean War veterans who replaced pilots posted back to Australia.Mordike, The Post War Years, pp. 40‚Äì41 He married Jo Cranston in 1956; the couple had two daughters and a son. By November 1957, Newham had been promoted to flight lieutenant and was undergoing conversion training on the CAC Sabre. From 1958 to 1960 he served in Malaya with No. 3 Squadron, whose Sabres conducted operations against communist guerrillas in the final years of the Malayan Emergency.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 252, 259, 349 Rise to senior command alt=Low, head-on view of F-111 jet in flight, wings at minimum sweep with drop tanks underneath Newham attended RAAF Staff College, Canberra, from January to December 1964.Hurst, Strategy and Red Ink, p. 188 He then served as Chief Flying Instructor at No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, taking temporary command of the unit as a squadron leader from July 1965 to April 1966.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 142 That August, he commenced conversion training on the Dassault Mirage III supersonic jet fighter.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 128 Promoted to wing commander, from July 1967 to October 1968 he led No. 3 Squadron at Williamtown as it re- equipped with the Mirage.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 141 In 1971, Newham was appointed commanding officer of the Aircraft Research and Development Unit. The following year he became Officer Commanding RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria. By now a group captain, Newham was appointed Officer Commanding No. 82 Wing at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in 1973. He formed the RAAF Washington Flying Unit at McClellan Air Force Base, California, on 31 March to ferry the first twelve (out of a total order of twenty-four) General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bombers to Australia.RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, p. 150 On 1 June, Newham led the first three F-111s in to land at Amberley, a gala occasion attended by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, the Air Officer Commanding Operational Command, Air Vice Marshal Brian Eaton, and a large media contingent. Newham later recalled that \\"our air force cred went up in the area and in the world with that aeroplane\\".Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 108‚Äì109 Read ordered Newham to operate the F-111 with great caution initially, well within limits, lest the long-delayed and controversial aircraft suffer greater damage to its reputation through early attrition. Despite Newham's protests over the plane's capabilities, the restrictions remained in place until 1975.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 121 That year he was appointed Staff Officer Operations at Headquarters Operational Command (OPCOM). Senior command and later life Newham was promoted air commodore in 1976 and became Senior Air Staff Officer at OPCOM, serving through the following year. In 1978 he attended the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, and was made Director General of Operational Requirements in 1979. In this capacity he visited Israel to investigate air- to-air refuelling operations, coming away favourably impressed: \\"the Israelis had more match practice than anybody around at the time. The experience gave me confidence in operational judgments.\\"Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, pp. 67‚Äì68 He was promoted air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Air Force Operations in March 1980, effective from April, and served on the Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee.McNamara, The Quiet Man, p. 125 In 1982 he was posted to the United States as the Head of Australian Defence Staff in Washington, D.C. Returning to Australia, Newham became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in March 1984.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 73 He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 11 June for services to the RAAF. Promoted to air marshal, Newham became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 21 May 1985, succeeding Air Marshal David Evans.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, v Newham initially endorsed the Federal government's 1986 Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, otherwise known as the Dibb Report, but shortly afterwards publicly criticised its \\"understanding of the application of air power\\" and \\"debatable judgments\\", especially its lukewarm attitude to the employment of the F-111s for strategic strike.Stephens, Power Plus Attitude, pp. 168‚Äì169 At a conference the same year, he reiterated the RAAF's position that \\"defensive action may prevent defeat, but wars can be won only by offensive action\\".Stephens, Power Plus Attitude, p. 166 On 9 June, he was raised to Companion of the Order of Australia for service to the RAAF, \\"particularly as Chief of the Air Staff\\". Newham's term as CAS was also marked by the Federal government's decision to transfer the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army, against the recommendation of an independent committee. According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, \\"Newham protected the best interests of the Australian Defence Force by getting on with the business of effecting the transfer, notwithstanding the deep disappointment within his own service. In February 1987, OPCOM (subsequently Air Command) was restructured into Force Element Groups (FEGs), large functional organisations that supplanted the earlier concept of all-powerful air base commands, to which every unit on a base reported.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 70 Initially established on a one-year trial basis, the FEGs have remained in place. Newham completed his tenure as CAS on 3 July 1987 and was succeeded by Air Marshal Ray Funnell. Retiring from the Air Force, he became Director of Helitech Industries. On 23 July 1998, he was among those present when the Korean Ambassador to Australia awarded his government's Presidential Unit Citation to No. 77 Squadron.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 146 Newham was one of ten surviving veterans of the squadron belatedly presented with the US Air Medal in Canberra on 27 June 2011, for meritorious service in the Korean War.

The game was originally announced at the Tokyo Game Show 2009 as one of the title supporting the PlayStation Move controller. The title was released on December 9, 2010 in Japan, on June 22, 2011 in Europe, and on July 5, 2011 in North America. An English version of the game in Asia was also released January 31, 2011. Gameplay A Pipo Monkey acting like Tom Cat Jr. is morphed to Thunder Ace forever. Unlike other games in the Ape Escape series, the game is an on- rails shooting game rather than a platformer. Players view the game from a first-person perspective with the motion controller acting as a gadget on- screen which include a floating net, a slingshot and a harisen. Players cycle through their arsenal using the Move button while either pressing the trigger button or performing gestures to utilize the gadget. For example, players swing the net to catch monkeys, press the trigger button to fire slingshots and wave the controller to use the fan. Players traverse from area to area via an on-rails method. Each area is filled with monkeys and players must ultimately catch all of them using the net. Each gadget is used for a different purpose: slingshots are used to annoy monkeys, destroy objects, and shoot banana power-ups, while the fan is used to blow away debris. To shift the camera players press either the \\"X\\" or \\"O\\" buttons to turn left or right respectively. Development On September 24, 2009, at the Tokyo Game Show, an Ape Escape game for the PlayStation 3 (named \\"Ape Escape\\" working title) was confirmed as a PlayStation Move title. Ape Club, the official website for the Ape Escape series in Europe, announced that the game would be released within the second to fourth quarter of 2010. They also stated that if players liked the Ape Escape game, Pipo Saru 2001, that you would also love this game. On May 14, 2010 the first official images of the game were finally released which included a working logo for the game as well as a promotional image for the game. They were part of a total of three clues given out to the public on that day with the other two being \\"Has something that no other Ape Escape games have\\" and \\"It's a keeper.\\" On July 5, 2010 a trailer for PlayStation Move was released. It displayed a one second clip of the game, which involved the player catching monkeys with a net, using the move controller, in first- person view. Another image was released by Ape Club, not seen in the trailer on July 9. It contained a picture of the \\"Gadget Widget\\", displaying the gadgets, and a new addition showing batteries. A full trailer for the game was finally released by Ape Club on September 3, 2010, which is shown at the Tokyo Game Show 2010 on September 16, 2010. On January 31, 2011, an English version of the game was released in Asian countries like Singapore along with a PlayStation Move bundle, it was released under the name Ape Escape On The Move. On March 10, 2011, the US PlayStation Blog announced that PlayStation Move Ape Escape would be coming to the US PlayStation Store during the Summer. Reception PlayStation Move Ape Escape received largely negative reviews, with average scores of 46.06% on GameRankings and 43/100 on Metacritic. IGN's Jack DeVries disliked the game and found that it was \\"missing a lot of shooter fundamentals like additional weapons ,[sic] co-op, and challenge,\\" concluding that it was \\"an embarrassing, shovelware shooter that feels more like a bargain bin Wii title than a first party affair.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official Page @ PlayStation.com Japan *Official Page for the English version of the game Category:2010 video games Category:Ape Escape games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:PlayStation Move-only games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Rail shooters Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Party video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games using Havok Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games ","title":"PlayStation Move Ape Escape"},{"id":"26513190","text":"Bosljiva Loka (; Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

Relief from the mastaba of Siese Siese ( \\"son of Isis\\", Egyptological pronunciation: Zaaset) was a vizier and treasurer of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt. He was most likely in office under Amenemhat II (about 1929 to 1895 BCE). Information about Siese is primarily derived from his mastaba, which was excavated by Jacques de Morgan around 1894‚Äì95 at Dahshur and rediscovered in 2008 by an Egyptian team. The mastaba was decorated with a palace facade and with scenes showing Siese and his family. Four panels with the image of Siese in front of an offering table were excavated by de Morgan and are now on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo. The burial chamber of the tomb is decorated with the Pyramid Texts. On the chamber, he is given the title \\"Treasurer\\". From other objects it is possible to reconstruct elements of his career. He started as a chamberlain, then was appointed high steward, and later became treasurer. Towards the end of his career he was appointed vizier.

As an international landmark of modern architecture it is a building that encourages encounters with art, people, and culture. At the foot of the famous Ulm Minster (), forming both a contrast and a complement to this dominating late-Gothic building, the Stadthaus and M√ºnsterplatz (minster square) were designed by the renowned US architect Richard Meier.  History  For centuries a monastery stood in the square of today‚Äôs Stadthaus which was also used as Latin grammar school.http://www.ulm.de/sixcms/media.php/29/S-2-3-3.pdfhttp://www.ulm.de/kultur_tourismus/stadtgeschichte/.42004.3076,3963,4236,34709,42007,42004.htm Artikel auf www.ulm.de/kultur_tourismus/stadtgeschichte It was finally dismantled in 1878 - shortly before completion of the Minster - in order to give a free view on the worlds highest spire.http://www.bad-bad.de/burda- museum/r_meier_ulm.htm Artikel auf bad-bad.de Thenceforth the design of M√ºnsterplatz in front of Ulm Minster has been subject of heated argument for 105 years and there are records of 17 design competitions, expert opinions and design submissions.Ingrid Honold: Der Ulmer M√ºnsterplatz: Wettbewerbe und Projekte zu seiner st√§dtebaulichen und architektonischen Gestaltung.

ISSN 0038-7452 Today the Stadthaus forms the centre of a redevelopment of Ulm‚Äôs city centre.  Architecture  The Stadthaus is experienced as one large space on different interrelated levels with a total area of 3,600 m¬≤. The open staircase connects all four levels and provides open and framed views to the interior spaces and the exterior beyond. On the ground floor many public services are offered from behind the curved sweep of the reception counter. A permanent exhibition devoted to the archaeology and history of the M√ºnsterplatz is located on the lower level. It offers a view out onto the square and is visible to passers-by. The contrast of austerely linear and gently curving forms characterises the interior space, where architecture and art form a symbiosis. All sides of the building relate to the immediate surroundings and using Spanish Rosa Dante granite to clad the building, floor the terraces and pave the square, was a deliberate choice by Richard Meier. Additionally, the gentle incline of the roof adopts the architecture of the neighbouring buildings.  Events and exhibitions  The Stadthaus both organises and co-produces outstanding cultural projects. It has become the civic forum in Ulm for events involving visitors to the city in the fields of arts, science and scholarship, politics, business, media, and current topics of common interest to the public. The hall seats up to 320 people and serves as concert hall, lecture hall, discussion forum and congress venue. The profile of the Stadthaus is characterised by experimental and unusual projects. High-calibre exhibitions have provided material for open debate. The exhibition programme focuses on contemporary art, including photography, as well as on architecture and environmental planning. It is a particular concern of the Stadthaus to provide a platform for young, upcoming artists. Another central component of the Stadthaus‚Äô concept is the annual ‚ÄòFestival f√ºr Neue Musik‚Äô (‚ÄòFestival of contemporary music‚Äô).

Dillman. \\"How to Conduct your own Survey: Leading professional give you proven techniques for getting reliable results.\\" (1995) that occurs when there is not a one-to-one correspondence between the target population and the sampling frame from which a sample is drawn. This can bias estimates calculated using survey data.Scheaffer, Richard L. 1996. Section 5 of Teaching Survey Sampling, by Ronald S. Fecso, William D. Kalsbeek, Sharon L. Lohr, Richard L. Scheaffer, Fritz J. Scheuren, Elizabeth A. Stasny. The American Statistician 50:4 (Nov., 1996), pp 335‚Äì337. (on jstor) For example, a researcher may wish to study the opinions of registered voters (target population) by calling residences listed in a telephone directory (sampling frame). Undercoverage may occur if not all voters are listed in the phone directory. Overcoverage could occur if some voters have more than one listed phone number. Bias could also occur if some phone numbers listed in the directory do not belong to registered voters. In this example, undercoverage, overcoverage, and bias due to inclusion of unregistered voters in the sampling frame are examples of coverage error.  Discussion  Coverage error is one type of Total survey error that can occur in survey sampling. In survey sampling, a sampling frame is the list of sampling units from which samples of a target population are drawn. Coverage error results when there are differences between the target population and the sample frame. For example, suppose a researcher is using Twitter to determine the opinion of U.S. voters on a recent action taken by the U.S. President. Although the researcher's target population is U.S. voters, she is using a list of Twitter users as her sampling frame. Because not all voters are Twitter users, and because not all Twitter users are voters, there will be a misalignment between the target population and the sampling frame that could lead to biased survey results because the demographics and opinions of Twitter using voters might not be representative of the target population of voters. Undercoverage occurs when the sampling frame does not include all members of the target population. In the previous example, voters are undercovered because not all voters are Twitter users. On the other hand, overcoverage results when some members of the target population are overrepresented in the sampling frame. In the previous example, it is possible that some users have more than one Twitter account, and are more likely to be included in the poll than Twitter users with only one account. Longitudinal studies are particularly susceptible to undercoverage, since the population being studied in a longitudinal survey can change over time. For example, a researcher might want to study the relationship between the letter grades received by third graders in a particular school district and the wages that these same children earn when they become adults. In this case, the researcher is interested in all third graders in the district who grow-up to be adults (target population). Her sampling frame might be a list of third graders in the school district (sampling frame). Over time, it is likely that the researcher will lose track of some of children used in the original study, so that her sample frame of adults no longer matches the sample frame of children used in the study.  Ways to Quantify Coverage Error  Many different methods have been used to quantify and correct for coverage error. Often, the methods employed are unique to specific agencies and organizations. For example, the United States Census Bureau has developed models using the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File, IRS 1040 address data, commercially available foreclosure counts, and other data to develop models capable of predicting undercount by census block. The Census Bureau has reported some success fitting such models to Zero Inflated Negative Binomial or Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions. Another method for quantifying coverage error employs mark-and-recapture methodology. In mark-and-recapture methodology, a sample is taken directly from the population, marked, and re- introduced into the population. At a later date, another sample is then taken from the population (re-capture), and the proportion of previously marked samples is used to estimate actual population size. This method can be extended to determining the validity of a sampling frame by taking a sample directly from the target population and then taking another sample from the data frame in order to estimate under-coverage. For example, suppose a census were conducted. After the completion of the census, random samples from the frame could be drawn to be counted again.  Ways to Reduce Coverage Error  One way to reduce coverage error is to rely on multiple sources to either build a sample frame or to solicit information. This is called a mixed-mode approach. For example, Washington State University students conducted Student Survey Experience Surveys by building a sample frame using both street addresses and email addresses. In another example of a mixed-mode approach, the 2010 U.S. Census primarily relied on residential mail responses, and then deployed field interviewers to interview non-responders. That way, Field Interviewers could determine whether or not the particular address still existed, or was still occupied. This approach had the added benefit of cost reduction as the majority of people responded by mail and did not require a field visit.  Example: 2010 Census  The U.S. Census Bureau prepares and maintains a Master Address File of some 144.9 million addresses that it uses as a sampling frame for the U.S. Decennial census and other surveys. Despite the efforts of some 111,105 field representatives and an expenditure of nearly half a billion dollars, the Census bureau still found a significant number of addresses that had not found their way into the Master Address File. Coverage Follow-Up (CFU) and Field Verification (FV) were Census Bureau operations conducted to improve the 2010 census using 2000 census data as a base. These operations were intended to address the following types of coverage error: Not counting someone who should have been counted; counting someone who should not have been counted; and counting someone who should have been counted, but whose identified location was in error. Coverage errors in the U.S. Census have the potential impact of allowing people groups to be underrepresented by the government. Of particular concern are \\"differential undercounts\\" which are underestimates of targeted demographic groups. Although the efforts of the CFU and FV improved the 2010 Census accuracy, more study was recommended to address the question of differential undercounts.

It is immediately superior to commodore and is subordinate to vice admiral. It is a two-star rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-7. The equivalent rank in the British Army and Royal Marines is major-general; and in the Royal Air Force, it is air vice-marshal. History The rank originated in the days of naval sailing squadrons and each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head. He would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron. The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle. In the rear of the naval squadron, a third admiral would command the remaining ships and, as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals. This has survived into the modern age, with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies. Prior to 1864 the Royal Navy was divided into colored squadrons which determined his career path. The command flags flown by Rear-Admiral changed a number of times during this period included. The Royal Navy rank of rear admiral should be distinguished from the office of Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, which is an Admiralty position usually held by a senior (and possibly retired) \\"full\\" admiral.

Marini was born in Ascoli Piceno, Italy, in 1885. He made his operatic debut in Ravenna as Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata. After his great success, he appeared at Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo as Enzo Grimaldo in Ponchielli's La Gioconda. In 1910 he made his appearance in Bucharest (Ernesto in Don Pasquale, Rodolfo in La boh√®me). Then, in 1912, he appeared at the Municipal Teatro of Rio de Janeiro, where he sang the roles of B. F. Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Hagenbach in Catalani's La Wally and Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca. In the same year he visited Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, where he had enormous successes in the roles of Hagenbach and Rodolfo. In 1915 he debuted at the Teatro alla Scala di Milano, in the role of Enzo Grimaldo, where he had a great success. In 1921 he returned to La Scala and sang the title roles in Puccini's Il tabarro and Gianni Schicchi, and Catalani's La Wally. In 1924 he was invited to Covent Garden in London, where he first sang the role of Andrea Ch√©nier of the opera of the same name by Umberto Giordano. After that Andrea Ch√©nier became Marini's signature role. In 1929 he sang this role in the first complete recording of Andrea Ch√©nier made together with Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala di Milano under the baton of maestro Lorenzo Molajoli (Naxos Historical 8.110066-67). Marini was also successful in Teatro La Fenice di Venezia, Teatro Regio di Torino, Teatro San Carlo di Napoli and Teatro Carlo Felice di Genova, where he sang the roles of Luigi (Puccini's Il tabarro), Rinuccio (Puccini's Gianni Schicchi), Rodolfo (La boh√®me), Faust (Boito's Mefistofele), Enzo Grimaldo (Ponchielli's La Gioconda) and Walter (Catalani's Loreley). Marini also made his appearances outside Italy: he sang at Oper Z√ºrich, Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and Teatro Sao Carlos in Lisbon, where he debuted in the roles of Edgardo in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Rodolfo in Puccini's La boh√®me and Turiddu in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. Marini ended his operatic career in 1931 after he had sung the role of Andrea Ch√©nier. He died in Ascoli Piceno in 1942.

Its boundaries correspond more or less with those of the Arrondissement of Bergerac, immediately east of the Bordeaux wine region. 1,200 wine-growers cultivate an area of . The Bergerac area contains 13 Appellations d'origine contr√¥l√©es (AOCs) for red, white (dry, medium-sweet and sweet) and ros√© wines. The vineyards extend across the southern part of the Dordogne department, the Arrondissement (urban district) of Bergerac. Bergerac soil also features excellent drainage as a result of its proximity to the Dordogne River. Approximately fifteen per cent of Bergerac AOC wine is sold outside France mainly to Great Britain, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. History As in the neighbouring wine-growing area of Bordeaux, the cultivation of vines began in this recently created country district of Bergeracois with the arrival of the Romans. Vines occupied a rapidly expanding place in the local economy, the River Dordogne helped to promote the wine trade along its navigable sections. The fall of the Roman Empire had few adverse effects on wine-growing, since the Visigoths, who became the country's new masters, were great wine drinkers. The arrival of the Saracens and the subsequent Viking raids dealt a severe blow to wine-growing. The Muslims ordered the uprooting of all vines and this, combined with the threat of danger from the northern invaders, caused communities to withdraw into themselves and killed off all trade. The Bergerac area has produced wines since the thirteenth century and has exported wines since 1254, when it began shipping its vintages to England based on special privileges granted by Henry III of England. These dispensations gave the Bergerac community the right to assembly, special tax exemptions and the right to ship their wines to Bordeaux unhindered. By the fourteenth century, Bergerac had strictly defined quality standards for its wine growing areas. Despite Bergerac's special privileges, during this period, Bordeaux was known to use its position, downriver and near the mouth of the Garonne river, to give its own wines priority over barrels of Bergerac wines being transported on freight carrying \\"gabarres\\" (river barges). However, the Parlement of Guyenne granted Bergerac a charter to transport freely its wines to the Atlantic in 1511. By that time, the Protestant-dominated Bergerac was also trading with Holland and Scandinavia via an overland route.Dordogne & the Lot, 5th Edition, by Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls, 2005 Renaissance to modern day The south-western province of La Guyenne was an area in which Calvinism prospered. When the Wars of Religion broke out, many Protestants emigrated, in particular to Holland. Their attachment to their own regional produce meant that the popularity of Bergerac wines soared. The wine-growers decided to change their strategy and concentrate on producing dry white and sweet dessert wines, which were sought by this market. In the 20th century, when the boundaries of the Bordeaux wine-growing area were being drawn up, it was decided they should match those of the Gironde department. Bergerac wines, which had long been sold under the generic name, Bordeaux, had to forge a new and separate identity overnight. The Libourne merchants who had traditionally sold these wines, now gave priority to wines with a Bordeaux label before even attempting to find a market for their other wines. Etymology The name Bergerac apparently comes from the word \\"Bragayrac\\", which is derived from the Gallic word \\"braca\\", meaning \\"manufacturer of breeches\\" (the baggy trousers worn by the Gauls). Soil composition and geology View of the vineyards from the Ch√¢teau of Monbazillac, with Bergerac in the background. The nature of the soils mirrors the extent of the wine-growing area.Fiche de l'AOC Bergerac sur le site INAO.gouv.fr. The lacustrian calcareous source rock of the south-eastern area produces brown soil containing calcareous pebbles. The soil varies in thickness. To the north of the River Dordogne, the source rock contains sands and clays mixed with gravel; the latter produce acid soils with a faded brown colour, while an accumulation of minerals deep below the surface create an impermeable sub-stratum known as \\"tran\\". In the south-east, boulb√®nes formed from sands and washed out silts result in a crusting soil that is poor in nutrients. To the west, calcareous source rock that was once marine, produces brown soil containing calcareous pebbles. These are the same soils as those found in the wine-growing areas of the east Gironde, such as Saint-√âmilion, C√¥tes de Castillon, C√¥tes de Franc. During the Quaternary period, the River Dordogne deposited terraces of gravel alluvia on both banks. These soils are acidic and not particularly fertile, but they offer good drainage. Climate The number of days with rainfall is 116, while fine weather days number 196, of which 123 enjoy small amounts of sunshine and 73 strong sunshine.Relev√©s des normales √† la station m√©t√©o-france de Bergerac. The Bergerac climate is temperate oceanic.Le climat en P√©rigord pourpre au pays de Bergerac sur le site pays-de-bergerac.com. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the period when the vines are producing new growth. April is humid, which boosts vine growth and helps to prevent disastrous spring frosts. The summers are warm and relatively dry, ideal conditions for the ripening of grape clusters. Over four consecutive months, from May to August, the area enjoys more than 200 hours of sunshine a month. It is this sunshine which supplies the necessary energy for photosynthesis. September and October are critical months in determining the production of great vintage wines. Dry weather in September concentrates the grape aromas, while moderate humidity in October promotes the development of noble rot, vital for the creation of great dessert wines. The November and December rains replenish the soil's water reserves. Grape varieties The red wines are a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, sometimes supplemented by C√¥t or, less commonly, by Fer Servadou or M√©rille. They are often dark in color, with full- bodied flavours. The white wines are mainly a blend of S√©millon with Sauvignon blanc, Sauvignon gris and Muscadelle, to which Ugni blanc, Ondenc and Chenin blanc are sometimes added. These combinations lead to the creation of fruity, dry white wines that can be powerful, and of medium-sweet or sweet wines that are aromatic and powerful.  Appellations  * Bergerac AOC: dry white wines, ros√© wines and red wines. These are wines that can be enjoyed young (from two years old). * C√¥tes de Bergerac AOC: mellow, soft red wines that can be stored. They only reach their prime after several years' storage in the wine cellar. * Montravel AOC: dry white wines and red wines. * Haut-Montravel AOC: sweet white wines. * C√¥tes de Montravel AOC: sweet white wines. * Monbazillac AOC: white dessert wines that can be stored for a long time. * P√©charmant AOC: red wines.

The offense typically relies on fast breaks while placing less emphasis on set plays. A run-and-gun team typically allows many points on defense as well. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the run and gun was at its peak in the 1960s when teams scored an average of 115 points a game. Around 2003, the average had dropped to 95. The Boston Celtics were a run-and-gun team in the 1950s and 1960s while winning 11 NBA championships, as were the five-time champion Los Angeles Lakers during their Showtime era in the 1980s. Although the run and gun is believed by many to de-emphasize defense, the Celtics of the 60s' had Bill Russell, and the Lakers of the 80s' had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as defensive stoppers. Coach Doug Moe, who ran the run and gun with the Denver Nuggets in the 1980s, believed the high scores surrendered were more indicative of the fast pace of the game than a low level of defense. Still, his teams sometimes appeared to give up baskets in order to score one. Though his offensive strategy led to high scores, Moe's Denver teams were never adept at running fast breaks. Paul Westhead coached the Loyola Marymount men's basketball team in the late 1980s using a version of the run and gun. While run and gun basketball is often thought of as a system of offense, Westhead's system uses a combined offensive and defensive philosophy. Offensively, the team moves the ball forward as quickly as possible and takes the first available shot, often a three-pointer. Westhead's teams try to shoot the ball in less than seven seconds. The aim is to shoot before the defense is able to get set. Defensively, the team applies constant full-court pressure. Generally, the team is willing to gamble on giving away easy baskets for the sake of maintaining a high tempo. Loyola Marymount successfully used the system in 1990 when they advanced to the Elite 8 of the NCAA Basketball Tournament, beating the defending champion Michigan 149‚Äì115 along the way. The style has been used at some other teams. Coach Westhead tried, rather unsuccessfully, to implement the system in the NBA with the Denver Nuggets in the early 1990s. They averaged a league-best 119.9 points per game in 1990-91, but also surrendered an NBA record 130.8 points per game. They also allowed 107 points to be scored in a single half to the Phoenix Suns, which also remains an NBA record. Westhead's system has been imitated by other college teams, including Grinnell College. David Arseneault, the architect of the Grinnell System, added to Westhead's system by substituting players in three waves of five players, similar to an ice hockey shift. The highest scoring game in NCAA history was played by two teams (Troy & DeVry-Atlanta) who both employed Westhead's system the entire game, resulting in 399 combined points in 1992.

Beevor (1999), p. 180 The historian Antony Beevor claims that he was a member of the NKVD,Beevor (1999), p 388 but there is no mention of this in Dyatlenko's account of the ultimatum delivery, and the index in Erickson's Road to Berlin lists him as a Red Army officer.Erickson (1983), p. 847 Together with Major Aleksandr Mikhailovich Smyslov from Red Army Intelligence, Dyatlenko was chosen by NKVD and Red Army officers to deliver notice of truce to the beleaguered German forces in the Kessel at the Battle of Stalingrad. Smyslov was to be the truce envoy and carried the truce papers in an oilskin packet,Beevor (1999), p. 326 whilst Dyatlenko was his interpreter.–°–æ–≤—ã–µ—Ç –º–∏–ª–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–π —Ä–µ–≤–∏–µ–≤ (Soviet Military Review), 1986, books.google.com, accessed 11 March 2010 Dyatlenko had no idea of the sort of behaviour that was expected of a truce envoy, later admitting that all he knew of the necessary protocols came from Solovyov's play Field Marshal Kutuzov.Beevor (1999), p. 323 On 7 January 1943 the two envoys were dressed in the finest uniforms available (the Russian quartermaster assured them that they would be \\"dressed like bridegrooms\\") and were driven with Colonel Vinogradov in a Willys jeep to the edge of 24th Army's sector at Kotluban. All shooting ceased during the night and on 8 January 1943, Dyatlenko and Smyslov, accompanied by a Red Army trumpeter armed with a three-note trumpet and a white flag, approached the German lines. On their first approach they were driven back by German fire. On a second approach they had no better luck; the fire was not aimed directly at them, but, as on the previous day, was meant to drive them back.Beevor (1999), pp. 323‚Äì4 Second attempt According to one account, the Stavka was keen to call off any further attempts to initiate a truceErickson (1983), p. 35 but on the evening of 8‚Äì9 January Russian planes overflew the Kessel, dropping leaflets signed by Voronov and Rokossovsky addressed to \\"Deutsche Offiziere, Unteroffiziere und Mannschaften\\" and printed with an ultimatum to Paulus; they also dropped bombs.Beevor (1999), p. 324 German soldiers later admitted that they had picked up these leaflets and read them, so the ultimatum was known about in the defending German army. Dyatlenko and Smyslov were driven to the HQ of the 96th Rifle Division near Marinovka, then a staff car drove them to the front line, from where they proceeded on foot. On their second attempt, the envoys forgot their white flag, so a new one had to be made from a sheet belonging to the divisional commander; this was nailed to a branch from an acacia.Beevor (1999), pp. 325 They were again accompanied by a trumpeter, this time a warrant officer named Siderov, whose call \\"Attention! Attention\\", although sounding to Dyatlenko more like 'The Last Post'\\", had the effect of attracting the attention of a German warrant officer. He asked their business. Blindfolded with the shirt from Siderov's snowsuit (as well as forgetting their white flag, the envoys had forgotten to bring the blindfolds they had carried on their attempt the day before) the three Soviets were led behind German lines, at one point slipping on the ice and creating \\"an unplanned diversion\\".Beevor (1999), p. 327 The German soldiers who came to their aid themselves slipped and fell over, reminding Dyatlenko of the Ukrainian children's game \\"A little heap is too little: someone is needed on top\\". Once they had reached the German trenches and had their blindfolds removed, Dyatlenklo realised to his embarrassment that he was carrying his pistol, against international convention. A senior German officer came in, then left to confer with his superiors; he soon returned and told the Soviet envoys to return, without their oilskin packet having had even a cursory inspection. Erickson wrote of the incident: \\"Paulus refused to meet the emissaries, who were informed that the Sixth Army's commander already knew the contents of the message from Soviet radio transmission.\\" Wilhelm Adam (middle) and Lt.-Gen.

BC) depicting Plato's Academy. A variety of ancient higher-learning institutions were developed in many cultures to provide institutional frameworks for scholarly activities. These ancient centres were sponsored and overseen by courts; by religious institutions, which sponsored cathedral schools, monastic schools, and madrasas; by scientific institutions, such as museums, hospitals, and observatories; and by individual scholars. They are to be distinguished from the Western-style university, an autonomous organization of scholars that originated in medieval EuropeStephen C. Ferruolo, The Origins of the University: The Schools of Paris and Their Critics, 1100-1215, (Stanford, Stanford University Press, 1985) pp. 4-5 and has been adopted in other regions in modern times (see list of oldest universities in continuous operation).  Europe and the Near East = Hellenism  alt=Man in red tunic holding scroll (perhaps Aristotle), in group of men sitting and standing The Platonic Academy (sometimes referred to as the University of Athens), founded ca. 387 BC in Athens, Greece, by the philosopher Plato, lasted 916 years (until AD 529) with interruptions. It was emulated during the Renaissance by the Florentine Platonic Academy, whose members saw themselves as following Plato's tradition. Around 335 BC, Plato's successor Aristotle founded the Peripatetic school, the students of which met at the Lyceum gymnasium in Athens. The school ceased in 86 BC during the famine, siege and sacking of Athens by Sulla.336 BC: ; 335 BC: ; 334 BC: During the Hellenistic period, the Museion in Alexandria (which included the Library of Alexandria) became the leading research institute for science and technology from which many Greek innovations sprang. The engineer Ctesibius (fl. 285‚Äì222 BC) may have been its first head. It was suppressed and burned between AD 216 and 272, and the library was destroyed between 272 and 391. The reputation of these Greek institutions was such that at least four central modern educational terms derive from them: the academy, the lyceum, the gymnasium and the museum.  Christian Europe  The University of Constantinople, founded as an institution of higher learning in 425, educated graduates to take on posts of authority in the imperial service or within the Church. It was reorganized as a corporation of students in 849 by the regent Bardas of emperor Michael III, is considered by some to be the earliest institution of higher learning with some of the characteristics we associate today with a university (research and teaching, auto-administration, academic independence, et cetera). If a university is defined as \\"an institution of higher learning\\" then it is preceded by several others, including the Academy that it was founded to compete with and eventually replaced. If the original meaning of the word is considered \\"a corporation of students\\" then this could be the first example of such an institution. The Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School were the two major literary schools of the First Bulgarian Empire. In Western Europe during the Early Middle Ages, bishops sponsored cathedral schools and monasteries sponsored monastic schools, chiefly dedicated to the education of clergy. The earliest evidence of a European episcopal school is that established in Visigothic Spain at the Second Council of Toledo in 527.Rich√©, Education and Culture, pp. 126-7. These early episcopal schools, with a focus on an apprenticeship in religious learning under a scholarly bishop, have been identified in Spain and in about twenty towns in Gaul during the 6th and 7th centuries.Rich√©, Education and Culture, pp. 282-90. In addition to these episcopal schools, there were monastic schools which educated monks and nuns, as well as future bishops, at a more advanced level.Rich√©, Education and Culture, pp. 290-8. Around the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, some of them developed into autonomous universities. A notable example is when the University of Paris grew out of the schools associated with the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the Monastery of Ste. Genevi√®ve, and the Abbey of St. Victor. Asia= Ancient India  Major Buddhist monasteries (mahaviharas), notably those at Pushpagiri, Nalanda, Valabhi, and Taxila, included schools that were some of the primary institutions of higher learning in ancient India. =Pushpagiri= Udayagiri, Odisha Part of Pushpagiri The school in Pushpagiri was established in the 3rd century AD as present Odisha, India. As of 2007, the ruins of this Mahavihara had not yet been fully excavated. Consequently, much of the Mahavihara's history remains unknown. Of the three Mahavihara campuses, Lalitgiri in the district of Cuttack is the oldest. Iconographic analysis indicates that Lalitgiri had already been established during the Shunga period of the 2nd century BC, making it one of the oldest Buddhist establishments in the world. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang), who visited it in AD 639, as Puphagiri Mahavihara, as well as in medieval Tibetan texts. However, unlike Takshila and Nalanda, the ruins of Pushpagiri were not discovered until 1995, when a lecturer from a local college first stumbled upon the site. The task of excavating Pushpagiri's ruins, stretching over of land, was undertaken by the Odisha Institute of Maritime and South East Asian Studies between 1996 and 2006. It is now being carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions also mention about this learning center. =Nalanda= Nalanda, ancient center of higher learning in Bihar, IndiaAltekar, Anant Sadashiv (1965). Education in Ancient India, Sixth, Varanasi: Nand Kishore & Bros.\\"Really Old School,\\" Garten, Jeffrey E.

It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war.OpEd in New York Times: Nalanda University The center had eight separate compounds, ten temples, meditation halls, classrooms, lakes and parks. It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, housing 10,000 students in the school's heyday and providing accommodation for 2,000 professors. Nalanda attracted pupils and scholars from Sri Lanka, Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey, who left accounts of the center. In 2014 a modern Nalanda University was launched in nearby Rajgir. =Taxila= Ancient Taxila or Takshashila, in ancient Gandhara, was an early Hindu and Buddhist centre of learning. According to scattered references that were only fixed a millennium later, it may have dated back to at least the fifth century BC. Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the sixth century BC.\\"History of Education\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007. The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis. Takshashila is described in some detail in later JƒÅtaka tales, written in Sri Lanka around the fifth century AD.Marshall 1975:81 It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the fifth century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous treatise Arthashastra (Sanskrit for The knowledge of Economics) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya),Kautilya . Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta and the Ayurvedic healer Charaka studied at Taxila. Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The Vedas and the Eighteen Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science. = Vikramashila = Vikramashila was one of the two most important centres of learning in India during the Pala Empire, along with Nalanda. Vikramashila was established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820) in response to a supposed decline in the quality of scholarship at Nalanda. Atisha, the renowned pandita, is sometimes listed as a notable abbot. It was destroyed by the forces of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200.Sanderson, Alexis. \\"The ≈öaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of ≈öaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo.

Vikramashila is known to us mainly through Tibetan sources, especially the writings of TƒÅranƒÅtha, the Tibetan monk historian of the 16th‚Äì17th centuries. Vikramashila was one of the largest Buddhist universities, with more than one hundred teachers and about one thousand students. It produced eminent scholars who were often invited by foreign countries to spread Buddhist learning, culture and religion. The most distinguished and eminent among all was Atisha Dipankara, a founder of the Sarma traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Subjects like philosophy, grammar, metaphysics, Indian logic etc. were taught here, but the most important branch of learning was tantrism. =Other= Further centres include Telhara in Bihar (probably older than Nalanda), Odantapuri, in Bihar (circa 550 - 1040), Somapura Mahavihara, in Bangladesh (from the Gupta period to the Turkic Muslim conquest), Sharada Peeth, Pakistan, Jagaddala Mahavihara, in Bengal (from the Pala period to the Turkic Muslim conquest), Nagarjunakonda, in Andhra Pradesh, Vikramashila, in Bihar (circa 800-1040), Valabhi, in Gujarat (from the Maitrak period to the Arab raids), Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (eighth century to modern times), Kanchipuram, in Tamil Nadu, Manyakheta, in Karnataka, Mahavihara, Abhayagiri VihƒÅra, and Jetavanaramaya, in Sri Lanka.  East Asia  In China, the ancient imperial academy known as Taixue was established by the Han Dynasty. It was intermittently inherited by succeeding Chinese dynasties up until the Qing dynasty, in some of which the name was changed to Guozixue or Guozijian. Peking University (Imperial University of Peking) established in 1898 is regarded as the replacement of Taixue. By 725 AD, Shuyuan or Academies of Classical Learning were private learning institutions established during the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. In Japan, Daigakuryo was founded in 671 and Ashikaga Gakko was founded in the 9th century and restored in 1432. In Korea, Taehak was founded in 372 and Gukhak was established in 682. Seowons were private institutions established during the Joseon dynasty which combined functions of a Confucian shrine and a preparatory school. The Seonggyungwan was founded by in 1398 to offer prayers and memorials to Confucius and his disciples, and to promote the study of the Confucian canon. It was the successor to Gukjagam from the Goryeo Dynasty (992). It was reopened as a private Western-style university in 1946.  Ancient Persia  The Academy of Gondishapur was established in the 3rd century AD under the rule of Sassanid kings and continued its scholarly activities up to four centuries after Islam came to Iran. It was an important medical centre of the 6th and 7th centuries and a prominent example of higher education model in pre-Islam Iran. When the Platonic Academy in Athens was closed in 529, some of its pagan scholars went to Gundishahpur, although they returned within a year to Byzantium.

He also taught at the Hanoi University of Business and Technology from 1996 to 2009. For his vast knowledge, he has also been visiting scholar to various universities around the world. He is internationally recognized as the leading scholar of twentieth-century Vietnamese history among his generation in Vietnam. He was also the author of various articles in the media, including the BBC in Vietnamese. ƒê·∫∑ng Phong died of cancer on 20 August 2010. Early life ƒê·∫∑ng Phong was the second of the two sons of a colonial official and a teacher. His youth was marked by the following historical events, of which he was a witness: * US bombs against Japanese interests in Hanoi and the Tonkin famine (1944) * the August revolution and Declaration of Independence in Hanoi (1945) * evacuation from Hanoi on the outbreak of the Indochina War (1946) * events of war in the countryside (1947-1954) * Vi·ªát Minh reoccupation of Hanoi (1954) His father's decision to join the Vi·ªát Minh in 1944 influenced his education, which he received by night in the 'liberated zone' from 1947-1954. After independence, he studied at Hanoi University and took a BA in history in 1960. Aged twenty-three he was employed by the Institute of Economics. His interest in economic history dated from this time. Public service and career In 1965, American bombings started and he was evacuated to a village in B·∫Øc Giang province. In 1967, he was sent as soldier and war correspondent on the southern front (Khe Sanh, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã province). Wounded, he returned to Hanoi in 1968. Upon Vietnam's reunification, he conducted research in Saigon (May‚ÄìSeptember 1975), and presented a report to the Institute of Economics on US aid to South Vietnam. In 1983, he was appointed to the State Committee for Markets and Prices, an economic analysis agency above ministerial rank, where he established the journal Markets and Prices Review. In 1988, this agency assigned him to compete for a scholarship to France, which he won, and spent a year at the Institut Agricole M√©diterran√©en in Montpellier. In 1995, he returned to the Institute of Economics, and signed a contract with the same institute after his formal retirement in 2003. He signed a similar contract with his second employer, the Hanoi University of Business and Technology. He co-authored books with Professor ƒê·ªó Ho√†i Nam (President of the Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences) and served as personal assistant to Mr V√µ VƒÉn Ki·ªát (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 1991-1996).

First Indochina War  Among the first divisions raised, the 324th Division participated in the Battle of H√≤a B√¨nh. Alongside the 320th Division and other units, this division had participated in laying ambushes on armoured and relief convoys intending to lift the siege of Dien Bien Phu alongside the battle itself. Vietnam War Starting in 1955, the 90th Regiment, 324th Division began operating in Cambodia and training cadres and battalions from ethnic Khmer and Central Highlands groups. These groups were to be trained as the nucleus for future revolutionary activities, in particular in securing the routes along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In 1961, the Division was placed in X√©p√¥n and along Route 9, on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. 1966-7 In response to increasing U.S. airstrikes, the Division was deployed increasingly southwards alongside artillery regiments attached to it to harass U.S. forces in northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. In April 1966 U.S. intelligence reported that the Division was digging in north of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). On the morning of 19 May, units from the 324B attacked isolated Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) outposts at Con Thien and Gio Linh south of the DMZ. On 6 July two soldiers from 812th Regiment of the Division were captured by Marines near the Rockpile, they revealed that their mission was to liberate Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. In response to this, the Marines launched Operation Hastings which ran from 15 July to 3 August 1966. Losses among the Division amounted to 824 killed and 17 captured. On the early morning of 26 August the Division's 812th Regiment attacked Cam L·ªô Combat Base killing nine Marines. At 04:00 on 8 May 1967 following an hour- long mortar and artillery barrage, the 4th and 6th Battalions of the 812th Regiment attacked the Marine base at Con Thien By 09:00 the Marines had repulsed the attack and the 812th Regiment withdrew leaving 197 dead and eight prisoners. On 14 May during Operation Prairie IV, the 1st Battalion 9th Marines (1/9 Marines) clearing Route 561 from Cam Lo to Con Thien were ambushed by the 6th Battalion, 812th Regiment, 28 Marines were killed for the loss of 134 PAVN. On 2 July the Marines launched Operation Buffalo, a sweep of the area north of Con Thien. As the 1/9 Marines moved along Route 561 in an area called the Marketplace, the 90th Regiment attacked the Marines inflicting severe casualties on Company B. This was the single worst day for Marines in Vietnam with 84 killed. Operation Buffalo concluded on 14 July at a cost of 159 Marines killed, while the 90th Regiment suffered 1,290 killed. On 16 July the Marines launched Operation Kingfisher in the western part of Leatherneck Square with the 324th also participating. The operation concluded on 31 October, in a series of skirmishes and ambushes the Division had lost 1,117 killed and five captured while 340 Marines were killed. In early November 1967, an Arc Light strike hit the headquarters of the 812th Regiment southwest of Con Thien. On 1 November 1967, the Marines launched Operation Kentucky as part of the continuing operations to secure the DMZ around Con Thien. The operation concluded on 28 February 1969, and the Division and 320th Division lost a total of 3,839 killed and 117 captured while the Marines lost 520 killed. 1968-72 The entire Division participated in the Battle of Khe Sanh. In early 1971 the Division together with other PAVN units opposed Operation Lam Son 719. By 19 March the Division's 29th and 803rd Regiments Regiment were attacking the South Vietnamese 147th Marine Brigade operating around Fire Support Base Delta () while its 812th Regiment attacked the 258th Marine Brigade at Fire Support Base Hotel in an attempt to prevent ARVN withdrawal along Route 9. At dawn on 21 March the 29th and 803rd Regiments attacked FSB Delta, the Marines held on supported by artillery fire and airstrikes including B-52 strikes which a prisoner later reported had killed 400 PAVN soldiers. The Marines lost 85 killed, while the Division lost 600 killed, five captured and 200 individual and 60 crew-served weapons captured. On the afternoon of 22 March the Division resumed its attack on FSB Delta supported by 10 tanks, the Marines destroyed the first two with M72 LAWs, mines destroyed a third and an airstrike destroyed the fourth but the remainder pressed the attack and the Marine Brigade withdrew towards Fire Support Base Hotel but were ambushed en route. By the morning of 23 March the 147th Marine Brigade had regrouped at FSB Hotel and were evacuated into South Vietnam having lost 37 killed or missing, total losses for the Division were estimated as being 2,000 killed or wounded. During the 1972 Easter Offensive the Division cut Highway 1 south of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and carried out the Shelling of Highway 1 in which an estimated 2000 civilians were killed by the indiscriminate artillery fire. On 17 May 1974 PAVN 2nd Corps was formed comprising the Division, the 304th and 325C Divisions, the 673rd Air Defense Division, the 164th Artillery Brigade, the 203rd tank Brigade, the 219th Engineer Brigade and the 463rd Signal Regiment under the command of Major General Ho√†ng VƒÉn Th√°i. On 18 July 1974, the Division's 29th Regiment, overran the An Hoa Industrial Complex and then on 29 July attacked the town of Th∆∞·ª£ng √ê·ª©c, which was defended by the ARVN 79th Ranger Battalion. Two regiments of the 304th Division joined the fight for Th∆∞·ª£ng √ê·ª©c which continued until 11 November 1974 with heavy losses for both sides. From 28 August to 10 December 1974 the Division's 803rd and 812th Regiments participated in the Battle of Ph√∫ L·ªôc for the control of hills that would allow the PAVN to shell Phu Bai Air Base and interdict Highway 1. After heavy fighting that depleted its reserve forces the South Vietnamese recaptured the hills. The PAVN claim to have \\"eliminated\\" 2,500 ARVN during the battle. 1975 As part of the Hue- Da Nang Campaign on 19 March the 324B and the 325C attacked the ARVN 1st Division and the 15th Ranger Group along Route 1 south of Hu·∫ø. On the afternoon of 22 March the Division pushed the 15th Rangers out of Ph√∫ L·ªôc cutting Route 1 and forcing the ARVN forces to withdraw back to a defensive line around Phu Bai Combat Base. On 24 March all ARVN forces were ordered to abandon Hu·∫ø and regroup in Danang, a disorganised seaborne evacuation followed and the 1st Regiment, 324th Division along with the VC 4th and 271st Regiments were able to destroy the last elements of the 147th Marine Brigade and the 15th Ranger Group, before they could board Republic of Vietnam Navy vessels anchored off the shores of H∆∞∆°ng Thuy, Luong Thien and Ke Sung and Cu Lai. By 25 March the PAVN was in control of the city. For the attack on Danang, by 26 March the Division's 3rd Regiment was located southwest of the city, the 9th Regiment of the 304th was located northwest of Danang, while the rest of the 304th and 711th Divisions encircled from the south and the 325C Division advanced from the north. By the afternoon of 29 March the 2nd Corps had penetrated the ARVN defences and entered the city which finally fell on 31 March.

The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1832. It is endemic to New Zealand and found in all parts of the country. Description The magpie moth's \\"woolly bear\\" caterpillars are around 35‚Äì38 mm when fully grown and predominantly black with lines of red down its sides and back, blue spots and tufts of hair on each segment. Its liking for the introduced ragwort causes its caterpillars to be sometimes misidentified as those of the cinnabar moth which was introduced as a biological control for ragwort. By contrast cinnabar caterpillars have smooth bodies with alternating yellow and black rings. The adult moth has black wings with white markings on both the forewings and hindwings. The forewings have two white spots that are more elongated while the hindwing only has a single spot near to the centre; the wingspan is 35‚Äì45 mm.Landcare Research. (1996). \\"Magpie moth\\". The thorax and abdomen of the moth are black with bands of orange. The magpie moth is diurnal which, coupled with its colourful markings means it is often mistaken for a butterfly. It is most active from September to June in the mornings and evenings where it can be seen flying over the tops of host plants. Nyctemera annulata is closely related to Nyctemera amica, an Australian species which also occurs in New Zealand. The two species may be able to interbreed.

Retrieved 26 February 2015 from http://eol.org/pages/865970/overview. This tolerance of cold weather and freezing temperatures has ensured they are able to exist throughout New Zealand. Habitat preferences Nyctemera annulata are only present in habitats where Senecio species occur. They are found most commonly in natural habitats but were also found to occur modified and urban habitats as long as Senecio host plants were present, either naturalized or native.Sullivan, J.

(1984). Insect-plant interactions between Magpie Moth (Nyctemera annulata) and four species of Senecio (Masters thesis, Canterbury University, 1984). Fourth and fifth instars feed in exposed positions on the top surface of the leaf and have well developed setae compared to the earlier instars. The larvae will feed primarily on species from the genus Senecio O'Brian, C. (1985). The Mobil New Zealand nature series: butterflies and moths. Auckland, New Zealand: Reed Methuen and are able to migrate considerable distances to new food sources when necessary. When the caterpillar is fully grown it will be approximately 36mm long and at this stage it begins to look for a crevice in which to spin its cocoon ready for pupation to take place. Hairs from the caterpillar are incorporated into its silken cocoon. The cocoon becomes black and shiny with yellow markings and the pupa will stay like this for 12 ‚Äì 35 days. The length of pupation is largely affected by temperature and the humidity also has an effect on the pupal survival. The complete cycle of Nyctemera annulata takes 6 ‚Äì 7 weeks depending on the temperature and therefore the time of year. Diet and foraging The primary food source of Nyctemera annulata are plants from the tribe Senecioinae of the Asteraceae. Thirty three species are known to exist in the wild and New Zealand has 19 native Senecio species with 14 of them naturalised exotics.Sullivan, J.J., Winsk, C.J., & Fowler, S.V. (2008). Novel host associations and habitats for \\"Senecio\\"-specialist herbivorous insects in Auckland. \\"New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 32\\"(2), 219-224. Retrieved from http://www.newzealandecology.org/nzje/ N. annulata diet is specifically limited to one specific plant. Even though the magpie moth is a native, it has been found that they do not restrict themselves to only the native Senecio species in New Zealand and will also feed on exotic introduced species. N. annulata is a monophagous herbivore insect meaning that their diet is limited to a species of plant. A study found that N. annulata did not restrict itself to the native Senecio although the insects were found more frequently in the native forested areas than in the urban/rural area These findings are based on research in the Auckland area, and the study found that the numbers of Nyctemera would be far fewer if there were not the naturalised exotic species available to them. The most common form of Senecio found in New Zealand is the introduced 'ragwort' (Jacobaea vulgaris) - a weed in most cultivated areas of the country and the magpie moth can often be seen around cultivated farmlands during the summer months and feed primarily on the leaves and flowers.Cameron, E. (1935). A Study of the Natural Control of Ragwort (Senecio Jacobaea L.). Journal of Ecology, 23(2), 265-322. Other favoured plants include Senecio vulgaris (groundsel) and garden cineraria.Cumber, R.A., & Eyles, A.C. (1961). Insects associated with the major fodder crops in the North Island.

New Zealand Journal of Zoology, 20(2), 95-120. doi:10.1080/03014223.1993.10422867 In addition, a predator known to attack N. annulata is a parasitic wasp. Echthromorpha intricatoria will attack by laying its egg into the pupae of the moth. The larvae of the wasp will then hatch and use the host as food to develop. It is believed that the patterning of the caterpillar acts as a warning to birds and as a result birds are not a threat to them. Due to its bright colour and bitter taste N. annulata is left alone by most bird predators. The shining cuckoo is one exception and will prey on the spiny caterpillar. The cuckoos tend to leave the skin, only eating the viscera of the caterpillar. If the skins are swallowed they are later disposed of in pellets covered with saliva. One third of the caterpillars found in the stomach of shining cuckoos in a study were N. annulata.Gill, B. (1980). Foods of the shining cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus, Aves: Cuculidae) in New Zealand.

Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.410.4240&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf Cultural uses Mokarakara is thought to be the name MƒÅori used for N. annulata, their description being that it was a day-flying moth that was black with white spots (Miller, 1952). Lessiter (1989) recorded that MƒÅori knew butterflies as p≈´rerehua and that they referred to the pupa as t≈´ngoungou (meaning \\"to nod\\"). This was describing the pupa's abdomen as it bends back and forth and the pupae were sometimes used in a child's game. Grandparents would ask their grandchildren to hold the pupa between their thumb and forefinger and ask questions of it. An example would be \\"Am I a good girl?\\". The answer would depend on which way the pupa wriggled ‚Äì up to indicate \\"yes\\" and down was for \\"no\\". There has been some research into the role of plant metabolites, particularly pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are sequestered by N. annulata. The alkaloids are produced by the plant as a defence against herbivory and the larvae of the moth take them up, potentially also as a form of defense suggested by the high levels of toxin found in the moth.Harborne, J. B. (1997). Recent advances in chemical ecology. Natural Product Reports. 14, 83-98. This may be another reason there is not much predation of either the larvae or moth.

The school is situated on the banks of the River Feale, and on the Cahirdown Road. History The school was founded by the Catholic Bishop of Kerry in 1879. The college was originally located in a town house in The Square, Listowel, but moved to the former fever hospital on the edge of the town, when that became available. With a student body of seventy mostly fee paying students, the college teachers were presided over by a president, who was a cleric up until 1989. Since, all principals/presidents have been lay persons.http://www.iol.ie/~coganj/school.htm. The school celebrated its centenary in 1979. The school retains its original home, and the old building still holds classes, offices and laboratories. Two extension programs have taken place since 1983. The first included the addition of ten new classrooms, an assembly hall, offices, a new staffroom and science laboratories. In 2003, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern opened a new extension which contains a further five classrooms, woodwork and metalwork rooms and a chemistry demonstration room. Dressing rooms were added to the sports hall, and a new football pitch was inaugurated in 2009.http://historical- debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0110/S.0110.198512040007.html.

It was established in January 1951. First Indochina War The Division was the target of Operation Mouette, launched on 15 October 1953, with the aim \\"to fix and destroy a major element of the Chu Luc before Gi√°p could deploy it.\\" The route for the Viet Minh between Thanh Hoa and the Red River Delta contained a crossroads at Lai Cac which was targeted by the operation. Seven Mobile Groups (Groupes Mobiles) were deployed with river and amphibious units; tank units (largely the M24 Chaffee); half-tracks and paratroopers at designated landing sites, after counter-intelligence misled the Viet Minh into defending the wrong locations. GM 2 and GM 3 took Lai Cac and established a camp. The night of 18 October saw heavy counterattacks, which the French resisted. The 13th Foreign Legion Demi- Brigade held out all night against one Viet Minh battalion. This initial action was followed by two weeks of probing by GM 4 and paratrooper units. These columns fought major engagements in the surrounding countryside against the Division, particularly on 2 November. The French withdrew overnight on 6‚Äì7 November. The French claimed over 1,000 Viet Minh killed and 2,500 wounded, while 182 were captured, along with \\"500 infantry weapons, plus 100 bazookas and recoilless guns and 3,000 mines.\\" Windrow notes that this would amount to one third of the Division. The Division's 48th Regiment was stationed at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß when the French launched Operation Castor, however after some small skirmishes the Viet Minh abandoned the valley rather than engaging the French paratroops. In late December 1953 General Gi√°p ordered the Division to infiltrate into the Red River Delta and assist Viet Minh local regiments to increase the pressure on the French in this region while he concentrated his forces for the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. They were sent to disrupt the region between Hanoi and Haiphong, behind the De Lattre Line. French forces from Cochinchina and Annam were sent northwards to interdict this. The French further claimed that they were put out of action for at least two months. Vietnam War On 23 August 1965, the PAVN General Staff ordered the Division to split into 320A Division and 320B Division. This section details the history of the 320A Division. On 1 November 1967, the Marines launched Operation Kentucky as part of the continuing operations to secure the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) around Con Thien. The operation concluded on 28 February 1969, the Division and 324th Division lost a total of 3,839 killed and 117 captured while the Marines lost 520 killed. The Division played a supporting role in the Battle of Khe Sanh, largely tasked with keeping Route 9 from Ca Lu to the Khe Sanh Combat Base closed. On 24 January 1968 elements of the 320th ambushed a Marine convoy between Dong Ha and Camp Carroll and then ambushed the relief force from the 2nd Battalion 9th Marines killing nine Marines. The subsequent Marine clearing operation, including the \\"Battle of Mike's Hill\\", lasted until 29 January and resulted in 21 Marines killed and 130 PAVN killed and six captured. In early March 1968 following an action at Mai Xa Thi, prisoners revealed that the Division was moving into the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát region to replace the 803rd Regiment which was moving further south into Thua Thien Province. On 29 April the Division attacked An Binh, north of ƒê√¥ng H√†, this drew two battalions of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Regiment, 1st Division into a running battle and the 1st Battalion 9th Marines was sent into support the ARVN resulting in a 7 hour long battle that left 11 Marines, 17 ARVN and over 150 PAVN dead. The following day the 3rd Battalion 9th Marines arrived to support the Marine/ARVN force and was ambushed north of Cam Vu, 20 Marines and 41 PAVN were killed. Also on 30 April, a PAVN unit opened fire on a United States Navy Clearwater patrol from entrenched positions near Dai Do, 2.5 km northeast of ƒê√¥ng H√†. It was later discovered that four PAVN Battalions including the 48th and 56th from the Division had established themselves at Dai Do. The Battle of Dai Do lasted until 3 May and resulted in 81 Marines and over 600 PAVN killed. The Division engaged U.S. and ARVN forces elsewhere around ƒê√¥ng H√† from 4‚Äì6 April, on the evening of 6 April the 2nd Brigade 1st Cavalry Division was deployed into Tru Kinh and on 9 April was ambushed by a PAVN force resulting in 16 U.S. dead for the loss of 80 PAVN. On 10 April a night attack north of Nhi Ha was broken up by air, artillery and naval support, 159 PAVN were killed. After this the Division broke into small groups and was moving back towards the DMZ, from 9‚Äì17 May the 2nd Brigade reported killing 349 PAVN for the loss of 28 killed. While it seemed that the Division had abandoned their attempts to take ƒê√¥ng H√† this was just a temporary lull. On 22 May a unit from the Division ran into a company from 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines between Con Thien and Gio Linh and was caught in the open by Marine artillery and air support. East of Con Thien the 1st Battalion 4th Marines encountered another PAVN unit setting off a two-day battle as the PAVN tried to escape back through the DMZ resulting in 23 Marines and 225 PAVN killed. On 25 May in actions at Dai Do and Nhi Ha 350 PAVN were killed. In two actions at Tru Kinh on 26 May over 56 PAVN were killed for the loss of 10 Marines, while the ARVN killed 110 PAVN north of Thuong Nghia. On 27 April the Marines killed 28 PAVN and by 30 May the Division was attempting to escape through the Marine and ARVN cordon. Total PAVN losses in the second Battle of ƒê√¥ng H√† were over 1,000 killed. On 12 August 1968, a deserter from the 64th Regiment revealed that the Division had once again crossed the DMZ and was moving to positions near Cam Lo. In response to this the 3rd Marines deployed north of the Cam Lo River on 13 August and engaged the 8th Battalion of the 64th Regiment, killing 43. The operation continued until 26 October resulting in over 1,500 PAVN killed for the loss of less than 200 Marines. In early 1970 the 320B Division was converted from a training division to a mobile division subordinate to the PAVN High Command. In 1971, the Division, together with the 304th and 308th Divisions formed part of the PAVN B-70 Corps based in southern Laos. The entire B-70 Corps opposed ARVN forces during Operation Lam Son 719. By 19 March the Division's 64th Regiment was operating east of Ban Dong/A Luoi () in an attempt to prevent ARVN withdrawal along Route 9. During the Easter Offensive of 1972 the Division was involved in the Battle of Kontum attacking the ARVN fire support bases between Dak To and Kontum. On 20 January 1973 during the War of the flags period before the Paris Peace Accords came into effect on 28 January 1973, the Division attacked ƒê·ª©c C∆° Camp and by the next day seized the camp. During the Battle of Ban Me Thuot on 8 March 1975 the Division captured Ch∆∞ S√™ and Thuan Man northeast of Ban Me Thuot cutting Highway 14. On the night of 16 March the Division was ordered to pursue the ARVN and civilians from the Central Highlands who were withdrawing down Highway 7 towards the coast and by the next day the Division's 64th Regiment had cut Highway 7 at Cheo Reo, blocking the retreat in what became known as the \\"Highway of Tears\\". On 29 March 1975 the PAVN formed 3rd Corps comprising the 10th, 316th and 320th Divisions, the 675th Artillery Regiment, the 312th Anti-aircraft Regiment, 198th Sapper Regiment, 273rd Tank Regiment, 545th Engineer Regiment and the 29th Signal Regiment under the command of Major General V≈© LƒÉng. The Division then proceeded down Highway 7 into Ph√∫ Y√™n Province, capturing Tuy H√≤a on 1 April. The Division then went back up Highway 7 and then down Highway 14. The Division then attacked the ARVN 25th Division base at Dong Du northwest of Saigon. As part of the 3rd Corps, the Division participated in the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War. Present Day Today it remains part of PAVN 3rd Corps.

Succeeding 2001's Almost Heathen, Appalachian Incantation was the band's first studio release after a seven-year hiatus that lasted from 2001 to 2009. The album was released on April 30, 2010 by Napalm Records. Like their previous two releases, Appalachian Incantation is largely an instrumental album, although one track features vocals from Daniel Davies of Year Long Disaster. There is also a version with limited edition bonus disc entitled Cat Got Your Tongue EP. The bonus disc includes remastered rarities and re-recordings, one of which is a vocal track featuring John Garcia of Kyuss. Background Karma to Burn dissolved in 2002 due to a confrontation between band members Rich Mullins and William Mecum regarding the former‚Äôs heroin addiction. After leaving Karma to Burn, Mullins first joined Speedealer, and then co-founded Year Long Disaster with musician Daniel Davies. During the seven-year break, Mullins hoped for a Karma to Burn reunion, but did nothing to make it happen, ascertaining that the reunion could only happen if he reconciled with Mecum. In 2009, both Mecum and Mullins reconciled, and reformed the group to record a new album. Mecum and Year Long Disaster frontman Davies had been writing songs together, and wrote one called ‚ÄúWaiting on the Western World‚Äù, which was only the second of their collaborations (the first was a song for Year Long Disaster called ‚ÄúSeven of Swords‚Äù). Enjoying the writing process for the song, Mecum brought ‚ÄúWaiting on the Western World‚Äù to a Karma to Burn rehearsal, and it was decided to use the song on the band‚Äôs upcoming record - as well as to eventually make a Karma to Burn album featuring vocals and lyrics on every song, with Mullins stating the band‚Äôs hope for it to result in something better than their debut album.

It is located in the treasury of Mariastein.  History  Its design resembles the original archducal hat and depictions on coins of the archdukes Ferdinand I and Ferdinand II of Tyrol. It consists of a gilded copper circlet which rests ten triangular gables with precious stones and ornaments. It is closed with two arches surmounted by a globe and cross at the center. The copper circlet is hidden by the crimson cap which was originally turned up with ermine. The ermine has been lost over time and was replaced with silk in ermine pattern. Both the hat and the sceptre were probably made in 1602. Although the Tyrol was a county, the hat is called archducal hat since its ruler Maximilian III was an imperial Habsburg archduke, which is a higher rank than the count of Tyrol.

Flanery was an advocate for equal rights for women, and actively worked to pass legislation that would give women the right to vote. Family and early life Mary Elliott, daughter of Benjamin Franklin Elliott and Nancy (Kegley) Elliott, was born April 27, 1867 in a part of Carter County, Kentucky that would later become Elliott County, Kentucky. After completing her schooling at University of Charleston in West Virginia and the University of Kentucky, she was a public school teacher. Family Mary married William \\"Harvey\\" Flanery on June 28, 1893, and moved with him to Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Flanery family moved to Pikeville, Kentucky in 1896 for Harvey to work for Northern Coal and Coke as an attorney. Harvey and Mary had five children together; Sue, Merle, Dawn, Dew, and John. Journalism and literary interests While residing in Pikeville, Mary Flanery began a career as a writer. From 1904 until 1926, she worked as a journalist for the Ashland Daily Independent. She wrote a column called \\"Impressions of Kentucky's Legislature,\\" and she advocated for legislation as a means for social reform. Flanery personally supported the publication of books by female African- American poet Effie Waller Smith, who lived and worked in Pike County, Kentucky. Women's rights advocate Flanery was a member of the Kentucky Equal Right Association, and actively worked for women to have the right to vote. She worked for to improve the lives of women through reform of suffrage, marriage, and divorce laws. Kentucky Legislator After women gained suffrage in Kentucky, in 1921, Flanery ran as the Democratic party candidate for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representative from the 89th District representing Boyd County, Kentucky and won by a 250-vote margin. When Flanery took her seat in the lower house of the General Assembly in January 1922, she was the first female state legislator elected in Kentucky and the first female legislator elected south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. As an legislator, Flanery continued her advocacy for women's rights. She urged her colleagues to change legislation about marriage and divorce, and to implement the federal Shepard- Towner Maternity Act, a progressive era program that provided medical care to pregnant women and their children. Flanery's time in the General Assembly ended with an unsuccessful campaign for Secretary of State in 1923. She was defeated by another female trailblazer, Emma Guy Cromwell, who was the first female to hold a statewide office. Flanery stayed active in politics and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1924. Later life, death, and legacy Flanery was active member of in the General Federation of Women's Clubs of Kentucky. She was a member of the Daughters of the Revolution and in 1926, she founded the John Milton Elliott chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Death Flanery died at her residence, Elliot Hall, in Cattlettsburg on July 19, 1933, and was buried at Ashland Cemetery in Ashland, Kentucky. Legacy After Flanery became the first woman elected to the Kentucky State legislature, she was honored by the Kentucky Historical Society as Kentucky's Most Prominent Female. Mary Elliott Flanery is remembered today as a trailblazer for her work as a social reformer and her advocacy for women's rights through her work as a journalist and politician. In 1963, the Kentucky General Assembly honored Flanery by placing a bronze plaque at her desk in the Kentucky House of Representatives. In 2005, Kentucky Commission on Women recognized her by adding her portrait to the \\"Kentucky Women Remembered\\" exhibit at the Kentucky State Capitol building.

It saw action during the Second World War, serving mainly in the Mediterranean. During the conflict 88 submarines, some two-thirds of its total strength, were lost. Construction history The submarine fleet available to the Italian Royal Navy (the Regia Marina) in World War II was the product of a long term build-up during the interwar years, despite the prevailing economic and political pressures of the period. After World War I Italy had a fleet 47 submarines in various classes; these were mostly obsolescent and she was interested in replacing them. To this end the Regia Marina made plans for a fleet of vessels in three Types: *Type I ocean-going: *Type 2 coastal/sea-going; *Type 3 mine layers. *The Navy also invested time and resources in midget submarines and underwater special forces. At the same time the major powers were negotiating an arms limitation treaty at the 1922 Washington Naval Conference. Whilst there was discussion of banning submarines altogether, and to outlaw their use (a course favoured by Britain) both Italy and France opposed this. However the conference did place restrictions on the number and size of warships of various types that nations could build.Bagnasco p132 The ocean-going submarine was restricted to a 1500-ton surface displacement, while the coastal submarine was limited to 600 tons, though there was no limit placed on the numbers of these vessels that could be built. In the inter-war years : between 1925 and 1929 Italy built a series of ocean-going submarines in a number of small classes, in order to find the most suitable designs for expansion. Work was done principally by the design bureaux of Cavallini, resulting in the Mameli and Settembrini classes, and of Bernardis, building the Pisani, Bandiera, and Squalo classes. They also commissioned a design by Ansaldo, the Balilla class. This was followed in the 1930s by the Archimede, Brin, and, just prior to war, Liuzzi classes from Cavallini, and the Glauco, Marcello, and later, Marconi classes from Bernardis. They also ordered the Calvi and Argo classes from Ansaldo. Just prior to war, in 1939, the Italians also commissioned the Cagni class, designed specifically as a commerce raider with a long range and armed with 14 Torpedo Tubes of 17.7in calibre (these being more suitable against merchant ships). These were built to a CRDA/Bernardis design. For coastal and medium range operations, the Italian Navy ordered a series of submarine classes, known as the 600 series. This commenced in 1929 with the Argonauta class, followed by the Sirena, Perla, Adua, and Acciao classes, all to Bernardis designs. For minelaying operations the Italians built the Bragadin class in 1927 (a Bernardis design), followed in 1930 by the Micca, and then the Foca class, from Cavallini. Italy's interest in midget submarines resulted in the CA class, built in 1938, and followed during the war by CB, CC and CM classes. She also developed a manned torpedo, the SLC, an update of an Italian First World War design, for use by the Navy's special forces. During World War II Italy also had designs for a wartime building programme. This was the Flutto class of submarines, an enlarged 600 series design for medium-range use, with mass production under wartime conditions in mind. 48 vessels, in three series (Types) were ordered, but only 12 were completed. Also during the war Italy came to require a submersible transport; designs for this led to the R, or Romolo class of boats. Again, though 12 were ordered, only two were completed. Design features Italian submarines of this period were of various types, depending on the design bureau responsible. Bernardis favoured a single hull design, for better submerged characteristics, but adding side blisters for stability on the surface. This design was preferred by the Navy. Cavallini used a double hull format, or a partial double hull with saddle tanks, to aid surface performance; this design was found to give better results. Ansaldo also used the double hull, to emphasize surface handling. However these vessels compared unfavorably with their British and German contemporaries, with comparatively slow diving times and poor handling underwater. One feature that caused problems was the large conning tower, making the boat more visible on the surface, and slowing the dive time. During the war many of these were reconstructed to remedy this fault.Bagnasco p130 Service history In 1939 the Regia Marina had 107 submarines;Miller p12 this included 7 vessels of World War I vintage confined to training. Eight more were commissioned prior to joining hostilities, and a further 30 were commissioned during the war. The Italian submarine force was designed and intended to operate mainly in Mediterranean, in support of battle fleet or on scouting and patrolling missions, although its ocean-going vessels were also intended for the Atlantic. It also had a number of boats stationed overseas in Italy's colonial empire. At the joining of hostilities in June 1940 Italy had 115 submarines, of which 84 were operational;Miller p126 however 10 were lost in the first twenty days of action, due partly to flaws in quality, or poor training, and partly due to reckless bravado.Blair p165 Thereafter the Italians never had more than 25 to 30 boats at sea at any one time. The commander of the Italian submarine fleet on 10 June 1940 was Admiral Mario Falangola, who was replaced by Admiral Antonio Legnani in December 1941. Soon after June 1940 a submarine force was dispatched to the Atlantic, honouring a commitment to Germany to help in the Atlantic campaign. Code-named BETASOM, this force was stationed at Bordeaux in occupied France. 32 boats in total served in the Atlantic, equaling the German numbers at the time. Half of them later returned to the Mediterranean, or were converted to transports, for operations to Far East. The Italian submarines operating in the Atlantic overall sank 109 allied merchant ships totalling 593,864 tons.Pieka≈Çkiewicz, Janusz. Sea War: 1939‚Äì1945. Blandford Press, London ‚Äì New York, 1987, pg. 106, In the Mediterranean the submarine force suffered heavily in the face of intense anti submarine warfare, and in attacks on heavily guarded convoys and naval formations. Results were modest, with only 21 merchantmen and 13 enemy warships sunk (for a total around 100,000 tons); one reason for such a disappointing score was the lack of targets (with most of them being harder- to-hit warships, and the merchant ships being under heavy escort), and another was the outdated doctrine employed at the beginning of the war (with static patrols, and attacks being executed firing only one or two torpedoes), although this aspect was being corrected by 1942 (as proven during Operation Pedestal, when a more aggressive and dynamic conduct met with considerable success).Giorgio Giorgerini, ibidem In 1943 at Italy's surrender the Regia Marina had 34 boats operational, having lost 92 vessels in action (over two- thirds of their number). During the conflict 88 submarines, some two-thirds of its total strength, were lost. 3,021 men of the Italian submarine service were lost at sea during the war.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo.

Opera arrived in Latin America as a consequence of European colonization. On October 19, 1701, La p√∫rpura de la rosa premiered in Lima in the Viceroyalty of Peru, the first opera known to be composed and performed in the Americas. It is an opera in one act by Spanish composer Tom√°s de Torrej√≥n y Velasco with a libretto by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, and is the only surviving opera by Torrej√≥n y Velasco. It tells the myth of the love of Venus and Adonis, which provoked Mars's jealousy and his desire for vengeance.Stein, Louise K. (1999), La p√∫rpura de la Rosa (Introduction to the critical edition of the score and libretto), Ediciones Iberautor Promociones culturales S.R.L. / Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales, 1999, (reprinted with permission of the publisher on Mundoclasico.com). Accessed 5 September 2008. Opera performances were performed also in the country of Mexico. It is within that nation that the first indigenous opera composers of Latin America emerged, with Manuel de Zumaya (c. 1678‚Äì1755) being considered the first and most important early opera composer. Outsider of Per√∫ and Mexico, opera was slower to gain a foothold, and it wasn't until the early to mid-19th century that other nations in Latin America began producing their own opera composers. Many of these 19th-century operas focus on the historical conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples and were influenced by zarzuela, a form of Spanish opera . In the 20th century many nationalist operas were composed across Latin America, with particularly thriving opera scenes in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Today, there are numerous active opera houses throughout Latin America and composers continue to write new operas. We also have organizations such as the International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC) and Opera Hispanica who are promoting new Latin American operatic repertoire internationally. 18th-century opera In 1711, the opera Partenope premiered in Mexico City. Its music was by Manuel de Zumaya, the most important Mexican baroque composer. This opera is particularly important because it was the first opera composed in North America and the first opera composed in the Americas by someone from the Americas. 19th-century opera The first opera composed and premiered in Brazil was Jos√© Maur√≠cio Nunes Garcia's I Due Gemelli; the text has since been lost. A Noite de S√£o Jo√£o may be considered the first truly Brazilian opera, with a text in Portuguese by Elias √Ålvares Lobo. The most famous Brazilian composer was Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes. Many of his operas premiered in Italy, with texts in Italian. However, Gomes often used typically Brazilian themes in his work, such as in his operas Il Guarany and Lo schiavo.Volpe, Maria Alice, \\"Remaking the Brazilian Myth of National Foundation: Il Guarany\\" (Autumn-Winter 2002). Latin American Music Review/Revista de M√∫sica Latinoamericana, 23 (2): pp. 179‚Äì194B√©hague, Gerard (1992), \\"Schiavo, Lo\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Vol. 4, p. 218 The nineteenth-century opera Guatimotzin by Mexican composer Aniceto Ortega was the first conscious attempt to incorporate pre-Hispanic elements into the formal characteristics of opera.Grout and Williams Weigel (2003) p. 561. Other important 19th-century Mexican operas are Agorante, rey de la Nubia by Miguel Meneses (premiered during the commemorative festivities for the birthday of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico), Pirro de Arag√≥n by Leonardo Canales, and Keofar by Felipe Villanueva. The operatic works of Melesio Morales are the most important in Mexico in the 19th century. His operas Romeo y Julieta, Ildegonda, Gino Corsini, and Cleopatra were very successful among the public of Mexico City, and premiered in Europe. The last opera by Melesio Morales, Anita, which was composed in 1908, did not premiere until 2000. Morales's last period of composition coincided with the creation of operas in Mexico by his son Julio Morales, and the operas of Felipe Villanueva, Ricardo Castro, and Gustavo E. Campa. The work of Ricardo Castro is a part of the tradition of historic, nationalist operas, such as Guatimotzin by Aniceto Ortega, Il Guarany by Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes, Ollanta and Atahualpa by Jos√© Mar√≠a Valle Riestra, Hu√©mac by Pascual de Rogatis, and Quich√© Vinak by Jes√∫s Castillo. This tradition formed part of a turn-of-the-century operatic movement, in which other important figures included Eliodoro Ortiz de Z√°rate (Chile), Jos√© Mar√≠a Ponce de Le√≥n (Colombia), Augusto Azzali (Colombia), Le√≥n Ribeiro (Uruguay), Francisco Hargreaves (Argentina), Miguel Rojas (Argentina), and Edoardo Torrens (Argentina). The first Venezuelan opera was El maestro Rufo Zapatero, an opera buffa composed by Jos√© Mar√≠a Osorio in 1847. (However, many have called Virginia, by Jos√© √Ångel Montero, the first Venezuelan opera, though it premiered in 1877 under the auspices of the president Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco) . Earlier, various zarzuelas has been composed, but the first to premiere is believed to be Los alemanes en Italia by Jos√© √Ångel Montero in the 1860s. Montero also premiered the one-act zarzuelas El Cumplea√±os de Leonor, El Charlat√°n Mudo, La Modista, and many others. Another major Venezuelan composer was Reynaldo Hahn, his operas include Le Merchand de Venise and Ciboulette. Hahn's work was greatly influenced by his teacher Jules Massenet. In zarzuela, another important figure was Pedro El√≠as Guti√©rrez, who incorporated typically Venezuelan rhythms into his work. Tom√°s Giribaldi's La Parisina is considered the first Uruguayan opera. It premiered in September 1878. The work was very successful and awakened public interest in operas written by Uruguayan composers. Because of this success, the Uruguayan Oscar Camps y Soler wrote his opera Esmeralda, la gitana, based on the Victor Hugo novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame; the opera premiered in Montevideo in 1879. Other Uruguayan composers that wrote opera in this era, motivated by the success of La Parisina, include Le√≥n Ribeiro and Alfonso Broqua. Le√≥n Ribeiro premiered his opera Col√≥n in 1892 during the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Alfonso Broqua wrote one opera, Tabar√©, based on the eponymous 1888 poem by Jos√© Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n. In the 19th and 20th century, a number of operas were produced in Latin America in which conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples was a theme. Among the most important operas of this type are Liropeya by Le√≥n Ribeiro (Uruguay); Guatimotzin by Aniceto Ortega (Mexico); Il Guarany by Antonio Carlos Gomes (1836‚Äì1896), based on a novel by the Brazilian Jos√© Martiniano de Alencar; Atzimba by Ricardo Castro (Mexico, 1864‚Äì1907); the three eponymous operas based on the Tabar√© by Jos√© Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n, written, respectively, by Arturo Cosgaya Ceballos (Mexico, 1869‚Äì1937), Heliodoro Oseguera (Mexico), and Alfonso Broqua (Uruguay); Los Martirios de Colon written by Federico Ruiz (Venezuela) and the three Ecuadorian operas based on the novel Cumand√° o un drama entre salvajes by Juan Le√≥n Mera, namely Cumand√° by Luis H. Salgado (1903‚Äì1977), Cumand√° o la virgen de las selvas by Pedro Pablo Traversari Salazar (1874‚Äì1956), and Cumand√° by Sixto Mar√≠a Dur√°n C√°rdenas (1875‚Äì1947). 20th century and contemporary opera Argentine composer and conductor Ettore Panizza. Heitor Villa-Lobos circa 1922 Composer Alberto Ginastera. Juan Jos√© Castro Argentina In Argentina, opera developed with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration at the beginning of the century and with the opening of the Teatro Col√≥n in 1908 where most of those world premieres took place. The most influential Argentinian opera composers include Ettore Panizza (whose opera Aurora was commissioned for the Col√≥n inaugural season and Bizancio from 1939), Felipe Boero (El Matrero from 1929 his most famous opera, also Tucum√°n 1918, Ariana y Dyonisos, 1920, Raquela, 1923 and Siripo, 1937), Juan Jos√© Castro (composer of Bodas de sangre and La zapatera prodigiosa, both after Federico Garcia Lorca's plays and Proserpina y el extranjero, 1952), Carlos L√≥pez Buchardo (El sue√±o de Alma, 1914), Pascual De Rogatis (Huemac, 1916 and La novia del hereje, 1934), Eduardo Garcia Mansilla (La angelical manuelita,1917), Constantino Gaito (Petronio, 1919; Ollantay, 1926, La sangre de las guitarras), 1927, Floro Ugarte (Saika, 1920), Gilardo Gilardi (Ilse, 1923; La leyenda del uruta√∫, 1934), Athos Palma (Nazdah, 1924), Hector Iglesias Villoud (El Oro del Inca, 1953), Virt√∫ Maragno and Alberto Ginastera composer of Don Rodrigo, Beatrix Cenci and Bomarzo.Teatro Col√≥n. Performance archives In recent years other Argentinean opera composers include Roberto Garcia Morillo (El caso Maillard, 1977) Mario Perusso (La voz del silencio), Claudio Guidi-Drei (Medea, 1973), Juan Carlos Zorzi (Antigona Velez, 1991 and Don Juan, 1993), Pompeyo Camps (La hacienda, 1987, Marathon, 1990 and La oscuridad de la raz√≥n, 1996), Gerardo Gandini (La ciudad ausente, 1995 and Liederkreis, 2000), √Åstor Piazzolla (Maria de Buenos Aires) and Osvaldo Golijov (Ainadamar'‚Äô). In 2006 Centre for Experimentation (CETC) of Teatro Col√≥n, proposed that national poet Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill work with the composer of his choice. He chose Oscar Edelstein who went on to make the script for \\"Eterna flotaci√≥n: Los Monstruito‚Äô\\" from two poems of Fogwill, \\"Contra el Cristal de La Pecera de Acuario\\" (Against the Glass of the Aquarium) \\" and \\"El Antes de los Monstruito\\" from the book \\"Lo Dado\\", to transform them into a continuous discourse that functions as a dramatic text. The opera dealt with the presidency of Menem and the era of decadency, leading to the headline by music critic, Juan Carlos Montero, \\"The Poetic versus Social Degradation.\\" '' Brazil Important Brazilian opera composers in the first half of the 20th century include Heitor Villa-Lobos, the composer of operas such as Izath, Yerma, and Aglaia; and Camargo Guarnieri, composer of Um Homem S√≥ and Pedro Malazarte. Contemporary Brazilian opera continues these avant-garde tendencies, as is the case with works like Olga by Jorge Antunes, A Tempestade by Ronaldo Miranda, O Cientista by Silvio Barbato, and \\"Tamandu√° (The Anteater) ‚Äì A Brazilian Opera\\" by Joao MacDowell, founder of the International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC), a New York-based non-profit with a mission to create new repertoire based on collaboration of Brazilian and international artists. Cuba Opera has been present in Cuba since the latest part of the 18th century. Ecuador Recent Ecuadorian operas include Los Enemigos by Mes√≠as Maiguashca, based on the story The Secret Miracle by Jorge Luis Borges; Manuela y Bol√≠var by Diego Luzuriaga; and the instrumental opera El √°rbol de los p√°jaros by Arturo Rodas. Mexico Another interesting group is those composers that have tried to develop a Yucatecan operatic tradition based on Mayan legends. These composers typically work in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, and have been scorned by Mexican nationalist historians. These composers include Cosgaya Ceballos, R√≠os Escalante, Ricalde Moguel, Rivera Velador, C√°rdenas Samada, and Jebe Halfdan. In the first half of the 20th century, composer Juli√°n Carrillo was an important figure in Mexican opera, along with composers similar to him, including Antonio Gomezanda, Juan Le√≥n Mariscal, Julia Alonso, Sof√≠a Cancino de Cuevas, Jos√© F. V√°squez, Arnulfo Miramontes, Rafael J. Tello, Francisco Camacho Vega, and Efra√≠n P√©rez C√°mara. All of these composers have been relegated by official musical historiography, which only recognizes the work of nationalist composers. Since the end of the 20th century in Mexico (and in all of Latin America), composers are increasingly interested in writing opera. Important Mexican opera composers in the early 21st century include Federico Ibarra, Daniel Cat√°n, Leandro Espinosa, Marcela Rodr√≠guez, V√≠ctor Rasgado, Javier √Ålvarez, Roberto Ba√±uelas, Luis Jaime Cortez, Julio Estrada, Gabriela Ortiz, Enrique Gonz√°lez Medina, Manuel Henr√≠quez Romero, Leopoldo Novoa, Hilda Paredes, Mario Stern, Ren√© Torres, Juan Trigos, Samuel Zyman, Mathias Hinke, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, Isaac Ba√±uelos, Gabriel de Dios Figueroa, Enrique Gonz√°lez-Medina, Jos√© Carlos Ib√°√±ez Olvera, V√≠ctor Mendoza and Emmanuel V√°zquez. Venezuela In contemporary Venezuela, there are great lyrical composers, including Mar√≠a Luisa Escobar, whose works include Kanaime, Orqu√≠deas Azules, and Princesa Girasol. Other important composers include Hector Pellegatti (author of the verismo opera El Negro Miguel with lyrics by Pedro Blanco Vilari√±o), Alexis Rago (author of El P√°ramo, Miranda, and Froil√°n el Infausto), and Federico Ru√≠z (author of the famous opera buffa Los Martirios de Col√≥n, with a libretto by Aquiles Nazoa). Today, most operatic activity in Venezuela takes place at Teatro Teresa Carre√±o. Here, operas such as El P√°ramo by Alexis Rago and Los martirios de Col√≥n by Federico Ruiz have recently premiered. Other recent premieres include the opera Gertrudis by Gerardo Gerulewicz, with a libretto by Xiomara Moreno, work premiered in concert and in full stage production in Caracas, Venezuela. Venezuelan- American composer Sylvia Constantinidis who has written both, music and libretto for several lyrical works: two Dramatic Contemporary Operas, Araminta and Afrodita; one Experimental Short Opera, Aurora; and three Children Operas, Lincoln, Ponce de Leon, and The First ThanksGiving.

He was most recently the head coach of FC Viktoria 1889 Berlin.  Playing career  Herbst won the 1981 FIFA World Youth Championship in Australia with the German national youth team, three months after winning the 1981 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship with the German U-18 squad in D√ºsseldorf. It was in this time that Herbst signed for reigning Bundesliga champions FC Bayern Munich from the youth team of Hertha Zehlendorf. However, it wasn't until the latter half of the season that Herbst made his professional footballing debut, on 21 May 1982, as a substitute in the 3‚Äì2 home win over Arminia Bielefeld. His second, and only other appearance for Bayern, came the following weekend when he replaced Dieter Hoene√ü in the 84th minute of a 3‚Äì1 loss away to VfL Bochum. In the following season, Herbst's three goals in 17 games, including a brace in the 3‚Äì3 away draw at FC Schalke 04, helped Eintracht Braunschweig successfully escape relegation. Herbst signed for Borussia M√∂nchengladbach for the 1983‚Äì84 season and over the following five years, with the exception of one season at SV Darmstadt 98, played in 65 league games for the Borussen, including six DFB-Pokal and nine UEFA Cup appearances. In the twilight of his playing career, Thomas Herbst signed for Hertha Zehlendorf in the Regionalliga Nordost and after two years became player-manager. He couldn't, however, stop Zehlendorf from being relegated to the Oberliga. He departed the club in 1999.  Managerial career  Herbst became player-manager of T√ºrkiyemspor Berlin in 1999. He played two games for the club and got them promoted back to the Oberliga in his first season as Verbandsliga Berlin champions, and carried on as manager until 2006. A short spell at the helm of Berlin AK 07 saw Herbst return to T√ºrkiyemspor for one more season, before moving to Tennis Borussia Berlin on 1 July 2008. In his first season at the Mommsenstadion he guided TeBe to the 2009 NOFV- Oberliga Nord title, becoming division champions after winning 23 out of 30 games, beating runners-up Berliner FC Dynamo by 18 points and only marginally losing out on being crowned Berliner Landespokal winners after a 2‚Äì1 final defeat to 1.

The film features Kelly McGillis, Jeff Daniels, Mandy Patinkin and Jessica Tandy. Plot Emily Crane (Kelly McGillis), a picture editor for Life magazine, is fired after refusing to give names to a 1951 House Un- American Activities Committee and takes a part-time job as companion to an old lady. One day her attention is drawn to a noisy argument being conducted in a neighboring house. She eavesdrops through an open window, seeing that one of those involved is her main senator prosecutor, Ray Salwen (Mandy Patinkin). His opponent is an elderly man who speaks only German; a younger man named Stefan (Christopher Buchholz), whom Emily had earlier asked for directions, is interpreting their confrontation. Emily meets Stefan on the street again and attempts to press him for information; when he rebuffs her, she follows him to a cemetery, where he demands to know why she is interested. They arrange a later meeting at a book shop, but are accosted by two men claiming to be US Immigration agents, which a panicked Stefan denies. He and Emily escape their pursuit, but before Stefan can tell Emily more, he is murdered by a knife- wielding assassin. During the crime scene investigation, the police find a list of four names in Stefan's pocket, and Emily insists that they search the house where she overheard the argument. The police are skeptical of Emily's story, so she decides to search the house herself; the assassin reappears, but is thwarted by FBI agent Cochran (Jeff Daniels), who has been keeping an eye on Emily for several days. After a scuffle, the assassin flees, and Cochran takes Emily home ‚Äî but not before she picks up a book with a woman's name and a date written inside the cover. Cochran and his partner, Hackett (Kenneth Welsh), deduce that the name is actually that of a ship, and that it will be arriving in the Port of New York City the next day. Cochran and Emily observe the ship's arrival, but the intrigue grows when Cochran notes government officials present to receive some of the passengers. Rather than take immediate action, they follow the passengers to a wedding party, where Emily recognises one of the group as the man who had the heated argument with Salwen ‚Äî only he now speaks fluent English and introduces himself as Teperson, one of the names on Stefan's list. Emily slips away, eavesdrops on another conversation and learns that the group will be leaving on a train for Chicago the next evening. This time, she is intercepted by bodyguards and taken to a restaurant where Salwen is waiting to meet her. Cochran, meanwhile, views a series of intelligence photographs featuring the men who are named on the list; they are all Nazi war criminals travelling under false names, being smuggled into the United States to participate in top-secret anti-Soviet scientific programs. Salwen cryptically reveals as much to Emily, who returns home to find Cochran trying to disarm a bomb rigged to several of her kitchen appliances. They escape Emily's apartment seconds before the bomb explodes, and though Cochran is removed from the investigation, Emily goes ahead to Grand Central Terminal to catch the party before their departure. Cochran disobeys orders and meets Emily at the station; the assassin makes another attempt on Emily, but is subdued by Cochran and Hackett. Outrunning Salwen's other henchmen, Emily is finally cornered by Salwen in the framework of the station's ceiling, where he makes one last attempt to convince her of the greater good of the smuggling operation. When he tries to restrain her physically, she kicks him off a catwalk, whereupon Salwen crashes through the ceiling and falls to his death. Cochran and Emily board the train carrying the criminals in the nick of time, where Cochran places the entire party under arrest. He loudly reveals to the other people on the train that Teperson is actually a physician who performed deadly experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. Case closed, Emily returns to her part-time job as Cochran informs her that he is being transferred to Butte, Montana, and it is not likely that they will see each other again. Cast * Kelly McGillis as Emily Crane * Jeff Daniels as Cochran * Mandy Patinkin as Ray Salwen * Jessica Tandy as Miss Venable * Jonathan Hogan as Alan * Remak Ramsay as Senator Byington * Ken Welsh as Hackett * Christopher Buchholz as Stefan Critical reception The reception for the film was mixed. Roger Ebert, film critic of the Chicago Sun- Times liked the film, especially the acting, and wrote \\"As thriller plots go, The House on Carroll Street is fairly old-fashioned, which is one of its merits. This is a movie where casting is important, and it works primarily because McGillis, like Ingrid Bergman in Notorious, seems absolutely trustworthy. She becomes the island of trust and sanity in the midst of deceit and treachery. The movie advances slowly enough for us to figure it out along with McGillis (or sometimes ahead of her), and there is a nice, ironic double- reverse in the fact that the government is following a good person who seems evil, and discovers evil people who seem good.\\" Janet Maslin, film critic for The New York Times, also gave the film a mixed review: \\"Mr. Yates does his best to make The House on Carroll Street a stylish period thriller, but its more ambitious scenes get away from him. A chase through a bookstore is monotonously staged, and the piece de resistance ‚Äî a battle across the upper reaches of Grand Central Terminal ‚Äî becomes noticeably clumsy. Even such showy gestures as having Salwen describe the Red Menace by pouring ketchup onto a white tablecloth manage to lack visual flair, not to mention political sophistication. It hardly helps that whenever the plucky Emily is doing her eavesdropping, she's able to overhear something much too convenient, like 'You'll be leaving on the Chicago Express, which departs at 6 o'clock.'\\" Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, film critics at Spirituality & Practice, gave the film a mixed review, writing \\"Although The House on Carroll Street lacks dramatic punch, the filmmakers deserve credit for raising moral issues involved in recruiting former Nazis to secure America's scientific lead over the Russians in the Cold War. Box office The movie was a box-office flop. Awards The film won the award for Best Film at Mystfest in Italy in 1988.

After the process of German Mediatisation, Bamberg became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria and the crown was transferred to the treasury of the Munich Residenz, where it still can be seen today.

Placed in service in the 13th Naval District, Ala operated out of Bremerton, providing local tug and tow service. On occasion, however, in the course of such prosaic but vitally important work without which a well-balanced fleet could not exist, circumstances sometimes called for selfless heroism on board yardcraft as well as combatant vessels. Late in the afternoon watch on 16 November 1941, the harbor tug was moving three ammunition lighters alongside the pier at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Puget Sound. With most of the deck force gathered aft, engaged in securing the lighters, no one apparently noticed Seaman 2nd class L.A. Minton, not a qualified swimmer, lose his footing and slip and fall over the side, forward. Once the men began coming from aft, they noted Minton‚Äôs absence. A hasty search yielded the sight of the missing sailor, clad in heavy clothing about four feet below the surface of the water, sinking between two of the lighters, repeatedly forced under by the high winds and flooding tide. Instantly sizing up the situation, Seaman 1st Class George E. Martin dove into the water and rescued Minton, saving him from drowning. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox later commended Martin for his ‚Äúprompt and heroic action,‚Äù and the petty officer received a Life Saving Medal from the United States Treasury Department. With the onset of hostilities soon thereafter, Ala continued carrying out her humble but invaluable tasks. On 15 April 1944, with the Alaskan portion of the 13th Naval District established as the 17th Naval District, Ala was assigned to the new entity. Exactly one month later, on 15 May 1944, she underwent reclassification as a large harbor tug and a redesignation as YTB-139. Following the war, Ala was reassigned to the 13th Naval District and she operated in and around Puget Sound until 1954. At that time, she returned to Alaskan waters under the operational control of the Commandant, 17th Naval District. Ala spent the remaining decade of her Navy career serving in the Aleutians and along the Alaskan coast. In February 1962, she was reclassified a medium harbor tug and redesignated YTM-139. Her activities came to an abrupt halt on 19 May 1964, however, when she ran aground and then sank in Kuluk Bay near the Naval Station, Adak. Ala was stricken from the Navy list on 20 May 1965.

The school was established in 1981 after the end of the liberation struggle and the gain of independence of Zimbabwe. It attained its name 'Rusununguko' which is a Shona word to mean freedom which the country got after the independence on 18 April 1980. Before its establishment, the only school which was in this area was Ndawora Primary School, the then St Pauls primary during the liberation struggle. It must not be confused with Rusunguko High School near Melfort, Bromley and Marondera. During the construction of this school, secondary students were accommodated under trees at Ndawora primary school which is on the side of the river Mutorahuku which divides these two schools. During the black empowerment efforts and education for all which were initiated by President Robert Mugabe, Rusununguko became a high school with the first A level stream starting in 2004. At the same time, the President donated 10 computers which saw the school using computers for the first time since its establishment. A great performance was produced by the students on that stream as there were 4 students who scored 10 points which was not expected as they started A level without enough teachers and study materials. During the 1990s, Rusununguko secondary was rated one of the best day schools in Shurugwi district with a third award which they earned in 1999 for best O level performance. Since the establishment of A level the pass rate was over 75% with the highest record of 14 points recorded in 2007 with Alfred Shumba one of the former students and a minimum of 0 points recorded on several occasions. Now Rusununguko is accommodating students who come from the surrounding communities and school for both A level and O level. It is rated higher than the surrounding schools at O level even though its pass rate is very poor, average 7% but the performance is quite good for A level. Rusununguko has recorded the highest past rate ever for A level of above 90% in 2010 though the highest points recorded that year were 12 points from a couple of students. The school offers commercial and arts subjects at A level and O level and it is likely that in the coming 5 or more years it may start offering sciences. Since the establishment of the school in 1981, it has recruited students which exceed 10,000 students which has been a result of the introduction of A level classes, with the increasing number leading to a shortage of classes. Rusununguko was one of the rural schools which were visited by the Romanian ambassador in 2006 and the former United States of America ambassador to Zimbabwe Charles Ray in 2012.

It is located around the road between the market town of Otoƒçac and the Plitvice Lakes National Park. It was likely mainly populated in the early to mid-17th century. The existing village church dates from 1753 and anecdotal evidence suggests it was preceded by an earlier wooden built church. A peak population was reached in the late 19th century and from there progressively reduced due to migration and war. It was almost totally de-populated in 1995 during the war that saw the breakup of the former Yugoslavia when the high majority of the population left for Serbia. A handful of old people remained in the village unable or unwilling to make the long trek. A few new people subsequently established holiday homes over the last 10 years and a few returned from Serbia. More recently, local authorities have given Roma people use of the many empty farm properties. The annual Petrovdan celebrations were re-established in the 2000s attracting people with a connection to the village from Serbia and from abroad (see 'YouTube' for films from various years). There are many people scattered around the world who have some connection with the village resulting from the many migrations away from the village throughout its history. For the village diaspora, there are many issues in trying to find their family ties and heritage. This is reviewed in the below section on 'Ancestor Records....'. Population Manojlo Grbiƒá lists that in 1768 Zaluznica comprised 68 households (the author estimates a population of around 600). A German publication, https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Jahrb√ºcher_f√ºr_slawische_Literatur,_Kunst_und_Wissenschaft, from 1847 has the population at 1,561 with 271 households (on page 91). This probably presents the pinnacle of the population. The 1848‚Äì49 upheavals in the Austrian Empire, Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, which required intervention of Russian forces on the side of the Austrians and the subsequent migrations to Northern Bosnia (Bosnia annexed by the Austrians in 1878) and the 'liberated' Lika border lands took its toll on the village population. The 1866 book by Vinko Sabljar, states 75 houses and a population of 990. A survey from 1895,Politiƒçko i sudbeno razdieljenje Kralj. Hrvatske i Slavonije i repertorij prebivali≈°ta po stanju od 31. svibnja 1895 had the population at 1139 with 178 households (made up of the main village and the hamlets of Draga Brakusa, ƒåelina, Gola Brdo and Cvijanoviƒá Kuca. In the first decade of the 20th century many people left for the US with the many millions of others from Europe.See Ellis Island online database Subsequently, the impact of the two World Wars (death and migration), the 1960/70s economic migration to cities both in Yugoslavia and central and Western Europe reduced the total population. Ultimately, the wholesale migration of the village to Serbia in 1995 due to war resulted in the near-total depopulation of the village. According to the 2011 census, there were 220 inhabitants living in 157 housing units. Based on anecdotal evidence from various visits to the village after this date, the number of permanent inhabitants is significantly lower, estimated at less than 30. Family names and households in the village is listed by Radoslav Grujiƒá in 1915: Agbaba - 1 household, Borƒçiƒá/Deliƒá - 1, Borovac - 20, Brakus - 46, Dorontiƒá - 5, Grbiƒá - 1, Grozdaniƒá - 1, Hiniƒá - 40, Ivanƒçeviƒá - 31, Kosiƒá - 6, Krainoviƒá/Krajnoviƒá - 4, Milinoviƒá - 2, Mirkoviƒá - 5, Novakoviƒá - 4, Popoviƒá - 33, Srbinoviƒá/Srbjanoviƒá - 1, Srdiƒá - 1, Uzelac - 10, Vukovojac - 12. Where there are only 1 or 2 houses of the same surname, they are likely to be most recently settled in the village. For example, the Srdiƒá and Grbiƒá surnames are mainly to be found in Vrhovine. The Grozdaniƒá name is mainly found in Ponori and associated hamlets. Borovac, Brakus, Hiniƒá, Ivanƒçeviƒá, Popoviƒá, and Vukovojac amongst a few others appear in the earliest Austrian army records; from at least 1756. As many households had the same family name although not related (in living memory) the practice of giving nicknames, called '≈°picnamen' (German origin) to differentiate themselves, was widespread. These nicknames originated for a variety of reasons and similarly to how surnames originated. In many cases, it referred to the given name of the head of the family at a point in time, although for the most populous surnames different nicknames evolved. Grujiƒá also documented some of the ≈°picnamen: Baƒáini, Bekuti, Bra≈°nari, Guslice, Kuƒáa, Seperi, ≈†amendulje, Vargani aka Hiniƒá, ƒåulumi, Mezani aka Ivanƒçeviƒá (an army record in the early 1800s lists a ƒåulumi from Zalu≈ænica), Dejiƒái, Dvogro≈°ke, Sajiƒái, ≈†are aka Popoviƒá, Karapand≈æe, Keseri, Pi≈°njaci aka Brakus, Korice aka Krajnoviƒá. Rough plan of Zalu≈ænica farmhouses 1970‚Äì80 (incomplete) The rough plan to the right is an incomplete view of farmhouses from the 1970s, including some of the '≈°picnamen'. Major exceptions are farmhouse details for Draga Brakus and the Hiniƒá concentrated around Um. Language Given the relative isolation, mixed origins, neighbouring Croats who spoke a different dialect (and accent) and the influence of the ruling Austro-Hungarian state, the language used by people in Zalu≈ænica and other nearby Serb villages developed its own character. From an academic perspective the people spoke the ≈†tokavian dialect and over-time mixed Ijekavian and Ekavian variants in every day language, which again reflects their origin e.g. in the mainly Serbian ekavian sub-class the word for 'milk' is 'mleko' compared to mljeko in the ijekavian form. Some words in an otherwise mainly shared south Slav lexicon were different e.g. the Serbian 'hleb' for 'bread' compared to Croatian 'kruh'. Some Zalu≈ænica villagers used the slang 'krua-leba'. German words (and corrupted forms) also became inter-mingled into everyday use, influenced by the direct Habsburg rule, e.g. German 'grau' for 'grey' as opposed to the Slavic 'siv', '≈°nider' for 'tailor' instead of 'krojaƒç', 'stoff' used for 'cloth' instead of 'tkanina'. There could be some Latin-based influence, originating from close by Venetian territories on the coast or from true vlachs e.g. 'ƒçeno' for 'dog' instead of Slavic 'pas'. The rural upland setting naturally stamped its own influences. Surrounding area Zalu≈ænica sits on the eastern slope of the Gacka valley and the main pass to the Plitvice plateau from the valley. It sits around the main road running from Plitvice Lakes National Park to Otoƒçac via Vrhovine. By car, it takes about 45 minutes to drive from the village to Plitvice and 20 minutes to Otoƒçac. To the west, at the edge of the village, the road splits. What used to be the Markovac country lane before 1995 is now the main road to Otoƒçac and the next village is Podum /Podhum (Serb village). Taking the road to the south-west, the first village is Sinac (Croatian village). Otoƒçac is the major market town in the Gacka Valley. Before 1995, it was populated by a Croat majority and large Serb minority. At the centrally located school house on the main road, a country lane runs northwards towards Doljani and ≈†kare. Following the main road eastwards towards Plitvice, the first village is Vrhovine (high majority Serb village) about 15 minutes drive. Vrhovine is probably the highest above sea level in the immediate area ('Vrh' literally means the 'top' or 'peak'); 700m above sea level compared to Zalu≈ænica's 500 m. Vrhovine has a railway station. While there were a few households off the beaten track there are was no other settlement between the villages; to the immediate south, south-east and north-east are mountain peaks. Beyond the schoolhouse and church along the main road is a limestone cavern and underground river, which until WW2 was the main drinking water supply for the village. A number of common use wells were dug around the village that tapped into the same underground water supply. Farmhouses are predominately located along the main and ≈†kare roads at the base of large hills. Farming Farming in Zalu≈ænica was a matter of self-subsistence made difficult by the limestone geology and rough terrain. The mainstays of the average farm was sheep, cattle, pigs, grains, and potatoes. Plum orchards were a very important resource from which the local spirit called ≈†livovic (otherwise rakija) was made. The winters are typically harsh, and the summers are hot. Until the early 1960s, most work on farms was manual throughout the year using bullocks/ox (or a few families who could afford to keep horses) as the main power source for heavy farm work. By the mid-1970s, farming became almost fully mechanised. Farms were small with many small fields scattered around the village resulting from historical family inheritance customs, which further limited the scope for larger farmsteads. For those farms away from the main road electricity was only connected in the late 1950‚Äì60s and piped water in the 1970-80's. History From its establishment due to conflict, the village and its people continued to be moulded by almost constant conflict throughout its history. The main exceptions were the economic migration to the US in the early 1900s and the relative prosperity of the 1960‚Äì1980s. It is therefore no surprise that village life was ended during conflict in 1995. The regular occurrence of war and conflict has seemingly destroyed most social and communal documents. The church records are missing. Most readily available documentation provides small snippets of tangential information; Austro- Hungarian Army records (18th to 20th century), 19th and early 20th century ecclesiastical and population surveys, and the Ellis Island information (1890 to 1920). Pre-1300s The presence of a notable opening at ground level to an underground river and caverns would have likely attracted people through the ages. In addition, the narrow pass at the eastern part of the village provides one of the few access points from the Gacka valley to the extensive lakes system of Plitvice. Beyond Draga Brakus towards the Vatinovac peak is the Bezdanjaƒça cave where around 200 burials were discovered dating to the middle to late Bronze Age (1500‚Äì750 BC). While there are Roman remains in Lika, there's nothing of note within the area of the village. Vrhovine had been a Roman settlement, called Arapium. From 1300, Otoƒçac became part of the Frankopan family estate, which probably extended to include the area that became Zalu≈ænica. Prior to the Ottoman incursions, there was possibly a Croatian settlement. Fras claims that in the general vicinity of the village there are traces of church ruins of which nothing is known other than its name of Sv.Mihovil. (Note: The reference to Fras is taken from a 1988 Croatian translation and not from the original book.). The name of the village evolved. A history of the Otoƒçac regiment by Franz Bach, mentions the village in the mid-18th century as \\"Sct Peter (Zalo≈ænica)\\", for example on page 51. The book by Vinko Sabljar lists the village as \\"Zalo≈ænica (Zalu≈ænica, Sveti-Petar)\\". The name refers to the church in the village, its full title 'Sveti Petar i Pavao' (St Peter & Paul).  Ottomans  In the aftermath of the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 the Ottomans pushed northwards further into south-eastern Europe, progressively taking control of Serbia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia hinterland. Venice maintained control of key cities on the coast. The spread of the Ottoman Empire forced large numbers of Slavic and other peoples into Austrian and Hungarian territories. The limited record in Venetian, Austrian and Hungarian lands report the arrival of people variously called Rascians, Serbs, and Vlachs from the 1500s. The Ottoman decimation of the Croatian nobility in 1493 at the Battle of Krbava Field in southern Lika caused major depopulation in Lika, people fleeing further northwards. The Ottomans settled Lika establishing a new border. The aforementioned possible Croatian settlement in the area of Zalu≈ænica likely disappeared around this time. Through the 1500s and particularly following the Hungarian defeat of 1526 at the Battle of Mohacs the Ottomans extended their territory. In Lika, this reached immediately to the south of Otoƒçac. From around the 1520s, it saw the emergence of the Uskoks. Catherine Wendy Bracewell's 'The Uskoks of Senj', describes the nature of this borderland, of skirmishes and raids. In 1553, Emperor Ferdinand granted this military border full civil and military authority to a general officer, to the displeasure of the Croatian nobility and Hungarian Diet. The regular and ongoing antagonism of the Croatians towards the Serb communities in the Military Border (Krajina) over the subsequent centuries seemingly stems from this time. Orthodox peoples were encouraged by the Austrian authorities to settle the de-populated borderland as they provided the means to defend the border without the high cost of deploying its own forces. These settlers were soldier/farmers and became known as Grenzers ( graniƒçari - literally 'border guards'). From around 1600 a large number of Serbs arrived in Croatia and Slavonia and were granted various rights including freedom of religion by the Emperor. From this time Krajina came under the direct control of the Austrian authorities. At around the same time, the Uskoks were forced out of Senj by Austrian authorities at the behest of Venice. Some were settled around Otoƒçac. A local Austrian official reports the arrival of 'Walachen' around the Otoƒáac area in 1611 ('families and their animals'). Although this could be confused for the Uskoks, the official further reports that they were fleeing the Turks. In November 1630, the Austrian Emperor announced the so-called Statuta Valachorum, establishing the status of settlers in the Austrian Empire. The Croatian nobility on regular occasions made efforts to remove Austrian control of Krajina, subsume the settlers into their feudal property and convert the 'schismatic' Orthodox population to Uniat or Catholicism. On more than one occasion this led to rebellion, for example, the 1728 major uprising in Lika. The Austrian authorities were forced to re-assert the rights of the Grenzers fearing the loss of their loyalty and therefore an important fighting force. On the other side of the border, the Ottomans resettled Christian subjects form their southern conquered lands into Northern Bosnia and Southern Lika, notwithstanding the settlement of Muslim converts from Bosnia and Ottomans. The intent was to create their own buffer zone around the border. Manojlo Grbiƒá wrote in 1890 that in 1658 people settled the Gacka valley who came from Usore in Bosnia and that in 1890 those people were Serb communities of Zalu≈ænica, ≈†kare, Doljani (etc.). However, there is no reference to the source of this information. While the border remained roughly in the same position, Lika continued to be subject to population migration and turmoil until the early 18th century. This reached a peak in the late 17th century after the Ottomans failed for a second time to conquer Vienna in 1683 (Great Turkish War). In Lika, the Grenzers forced out the majority of Ottoman and other Muslim settlers. Lika was re-settled from the north and any remaining Muslims (Slavic or otherwise) converted to Christianity. For a short period, there was again a significant de-population of Lika. Following the Ottoman defeat, the Austrians encouraged the Slavic population in Serbia and Bosnia to rise against the Ottomans. It failed, resulting in the (Great Migrations of the Serbs) of 1690, to mainly eastern Krajina (Slavonia) and Hungary, and to a lesser extent into western Krajina. This major upheaval caused further population migration into Lika. While the threat of Ottoman invasion had receded considerably since the early 18th century, the Grenzers continued to be involved in protecting the border with repeated incursions until the mid 19th century. The Austro-Turkish War (1788‚Äì1791) saw the last major conflict between the empires. In Lika more lands were taken from the Ottomans in the area around Korencia after this conflict. Austrian army records describe land given to local fighters for their efforts and included Grenzers from Zalu≈ænica, pre-empting migration to Bosnia some 80 years later. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there were multiple years of failed crops and famine. This again prompted population turmoil across Lika. The revolutions across the Austrian Empire in 1848‚Äì49 was a further major upheaval due to the losses of Grenzers in the various failed efforts by the Austrians to regain control. With Ottoman power dwindling in Bosnia and its annexation in 1878 by Austria, further migration occurred from Lika to Northern Bosnia occurred. It is therefore unsurprising of DNA links between people in the Gacka Valley and Korenica areas with those in Northern Bosnia. Around this time Zalu≈ænica people moved to Lika lands depopulated of Ottomans. There is anecdotal evidence that people from the Gacka Valley moved to the area that became the village of Turjanski. First farmed and grazed during summer months, around the 1870s people began to settle. This included at least one of the Hiniƒá families from Zalu≈ænica believed to be the ≈†egotini. A quick review of Turjanski surnames (before 1995) shows a very close match to Zalu≈ænica, Doljani and ≈†kare surnames. The ethnicity of the peoples who settled and re- settled Lika has been debated extensively, but in effect it is of little consequence as after a short time these peoples assimilated and identified themselves as Orthodox Serbs, becoming the majority population across the Krajina. The turmoil of the revolving cycle of war, raiding, migration, and settlement for around 300 years in Lika can be viewed simplistically as solely attributable to the Ottomans. While Ottoman aggression northwards was the cause of initial migrations, for much of this period the political machinations of Austrian foreign policy (and many non-Ottoman wars), Hungarian territorial claims, the Croatian nobility's efforts to hold onto feudalism, and Ottoman foreign policy (and many non-European wars), were the primary factors in the course of events that moulded Lika and therefore the people of Zalu≈ænica.  The Regiment  The settlers were soldiers first and farmers second, which ensured their status as freemen. The protection of the border dominated their lives and the settlers together with the Croatian populace in Lika progressively established themselves as a critical fighting force for the Austrian Empire. This was formally recognised from 1746 when the Grenzers were organised into the Austro-Hungarian Army under a number of regiments. In western Krajina, Karlovac (Karlstadt) became the primary headquarters with regiments based in Otoƒçac, Gospiƒá, Ogulin and Slunj Grenz infantry. The Otoƒçac regiment was initially called the \\"Karlst√§dter Otocaner Grenz-Infanterie- Regiment\\" and consisted of 4 battalions of around 5,000 men. The Otoƒçac regiment recruited from all communities across coastal, central and northern Lika. As the relative threat of the Ottomans retreated, the Grenzers became employed in the Empire's other wars in central Europe e.g. the Seven Years' War. With the Grenzer power base beginning to be perceived a problem by the Austrian authorities and following a Grenzer rebellion in 1800, the numbers were significantly reduced from around 57,000 to 13,000 together with various attempts to re-organise them. The regular wars with the French in the late 18th century and early 19th century ensured that the Grenzers remained an important force. The Otoƒçac regiment was on the battlefield against Napoleon. On defeating the Austrians, Lika and its regiments came under Napoleonic control for a short period from 1809 to 1814. Battalions from the various Lika regiments were part of the French army that invaded Russia. Following Napoleon's demise, Lika returned to Austrian control. The extent of the regiment's role in everyday life is indicated by 'births, deaths and marriages' records in the mid-19 century. For example, church records for Vrhovine from 1856 show that for even births the regiment and company of the father is documented. For marriage records, the regiment and company of both the groom and bride's households is documented. Various Otoƒçac Regiment records, from 1772 to 1819, document Zalu≈ænica soldiers including; Borovac, Brakus, Hiniƒá, Invaƒçeviƒá, Kosiƒá, Popoviƒá, Uzelac, and Vukovojac. The last vestiges of the Krajina were removed in 1881 by Emperor Francis Joseph. Ahead of this the Otoƒçac regiment, in 1880, was re-designated the 79th K.u.k. Infantry Regiment \\"Otocaner Graf Jellacic, which by in large remained intact until the end of WW1.  USA Migration  Towards the end of the 19th century, a trickle of individuals travelled to the USA seeking work and a better future, as millions of others did from Europe for the same reasons. From the turn of the century, the numbers leaving Zalu≈ænica for the USA ramped up significantly. The immigration records for New York (Ellis Island) and other ports of entry reveal a pattern of specific villagers travelling to a specific town/city in the US, built on the back of the first few who travelled there. Zalu≈ænica immigrants tended to favour Cleveland, Ohio. The immigrant stories are wide and varied. Some settled permanently in the US, some returned after a few years with enough money to make a difference to their families and inevitably became embroiled in WWI. The vast majority obtained manual work in factories (primary production such as steel making) and mining and of these many died or were significantly injured in industrial accidents. While mostly men made the trip, the records include women and children, both together and separately. Surnames were changed, purposely and by accident. Changes ranged from 'no change', minor changes to improve pronunciation in an English- speaking world and adoption of surnames that bore no resemblance to the original. Some were registered name changes while many just happened. Many 'disappeared' and only in the 2000s they have started to reappear through DNA testings, their descendants discovering previously unknown lineage to Lika and their actual family name.  World Wars  Leading to World War I the Otoƒçac regiment was designated k.u.k Infanterieregiment Graf Jella√®iƒá Nr.79. The 'Nr.79' was sent to the Serbian front at the start of WWI, with many of the A-H Army's Serb soldiers becoming POWs in Serbia. At the start of 1915, it found itself on the Galician front, through the Carpathian Mountains, fighting against Russian forces and suffering heavy losses through 1915. Many were taken as POWs. On Russia exiting the war in 1917 due to revolution, the resulting military and political chaos proved to be a massive obstacle for POWs in returning home. In the aftermath of the war, the allies supported the creation of a new country from the vestiges of the Ottoman Empire, the Austro- Hungarian Empire and the Serbian State, populated mainly by Slavic peoples. This new state came into being in 1918 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1929 it was renamed Yugoslavia, which translates to 'South- Slavs'. Although the creation of a 'south-slav' homeland had a basis of support from some sections of the 'south-slavs' themselves (and not just an Allied convenience), extreme nationalist forces quickly ensured a troubled existence throughout the inter-war period. It was however very predictable. The Independent Serbian state and the newly freed Croatian populace, having finally escaped 500 and 800 years respectively of domination by Imperialist powers, considered themselves forced into another unwelcome relationship. WW2 saw a level of brutality and death in Lika unseen since the height of the Ottoman conflicts. It was driven by the fascist NDH state's principle policy of removing Serbs from Croatian territory. The NDH was created in 1941 on the back of the German invasion of Yugoslavia and with the full support of fascist Italy, which had sponsored and groomed its leaders since the mid-1920s. Conditions for the Serb communities in Lika throughout the war are documented elsewhere in Wikipedia et al. The population of the village was decimated. This includes the significant number of men who left the village in 1944, walking out to Italy. They were later resettled by the Allies across Allied countries (mainly USA, UK, Canada, and Australia) after the end of the war, together with the many other displaced persons from Eastern Europe. At the onset of the conflict in 1941, the village associated itself with the Serbian Royalist forces led by Mihailoviƒá based in Ravna Gora and called themselves ƒçetniks. Their priority was the protection of the village from the NDH's Usta≈°e forces. Over time, they became embroiled with the broader regional conflict that involved multiple other fighting forces including Italian and German armies, the Usta≈°a and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito. Some people from the village later joined the partisans and it was not uncommon for families to be split between ƒçetniks and partisans. When the Allies switched logistical and armament support to the partisans in late 1943, the ƒçetniks were effectively forced to leave.  Post WW2  At the end of WW2 the partisans re-established the Yugoslav state, securing additional territory. Some villagers who were in the partisans were given land by the authorities in Baƒçka in the new territory of northeast Yugoslavia, which had been gained from Hungary in the post-war carve-up. At the expense of the 'volksdeutsche' (Danube Swabians who at best were expelled and their property confiscated, the Tito government repopulated the area with a major migration from across all Yugoslavia. A few villages in Baƒçka became 'Lika in the East', the migrants maintaining their Lika traditions. With many men having left during the war and settled in the West, it left a significant proportion of women in Zalu≈ænica without the prospect of marriage. The remaining families of those men abroad made matches and between 50 and 100 women left the village to join their new husbands following 'proxy' marriages. These marriages were officiated by the Yugoslav state and accepted by Western countries as valid marriage certificates for settlement purposes. The WW2 exodus and subsequent marriages were a second major source of the Zalu≈ænica diaspora. With Tito breaking from the Soviet Union, the country's economy started to open up in the 1960s. This was bolstered by the German economic explosion from the 1950s and the Yugoslav state's willingness to allow its citizens to work in Germany (also Austria and Switzerland at different times) by way of treaties with those countries. This had a dramatic effect on the village (and generally northern Yugoslavia) from the late 1960s and into the 1970s and 1980s. The most visible outcomes were; construction of new farmhouses across the village, the mechanisation of agriculture (which until the late-1960s was in the main still powered by oxen and horses), and the movement of young people to towns and cities across the country. Some of those working in Germany (and other countries) permanently settled there, forming the third major source of the Zalu≈ænica diaspora. The 'Croatian Spring' uprising of the late 1960s / early 1970s together with the heightened threat from Croat nationalists in the diaspora, who sought the re-establishment of an independent Croatia, raised tensions throughout the former Krajina. In Zalu≈ænica, a large police presence patrolled the annual Petrovdan celebrations during the early to mid-1970s after widespread rumour of attack. How much of the latter was part of Tito's propaganda machine is open to question. Tito's death inevitably and predictably led to the dissolution of the Yugoslav state as virulent nationalism took hold. Furthermore, political intrigues within the failing state and the machinations of historic Central European powers combined to force the disintegration of a nation state. The Serbs in the former Krajina established their own 'state', as other communities had done across the crumbling Yugoslavia, informed by the activities of the previous independent Croatian state during WW2. The final act saw the mass migration in 1995 of around one-quarter of a million people to Serbia ahead of the known Croatian military offensive. Farmers in Zalu≈ænica released their livestock to the fields and joined the long convoy through the ongoing hostilities in Bosnia to reach the Serbian border. The welcome there was less than warm. Zalu≈ænica people blamed Serbian president Milo≈°eviƒá for selling them out following his agreement with Croatian President Tudjman. The Croatian government's obligations under its pursuit of EU membership resulted in efforts to encourage the former population to return to their homes. War-battered farmhouses of the few elderly who had remained were repaired. A handful of mainly older people returned from Serbia. Others return to their ancestral homes during holiday periods and there are a few new arrivals. Some Croatians have purchased property in the village. A few Roma people have been allowed by local authorities to occupy some farmsteads. The village farmhouses remain in the most part derelict, particularly away from the main road. The new Zagreb- Split highway that passes close to Otoƒçac has reduced the Plitvice traffic passing through the village as the national park is accessible from the highway. The planned extension from the highway directly to Plitvice and onwards to the south-west will result in the almost total isolation of the village. After nearly 400 years the village and its people were lost to history. However, the increasing popularity of DNA testing, mainly in the diaspora, is slowly starting to rebuild a cultural memory of its people, which for once will remain intact through the internet. Ancestor Records, Family Trees and DNA The availability of birth, death and marriage (BDM) records for the village is limited with many destroyed during the multiple conflicts since the village was established. Tracing ancestors beyond living memory is therefore made difficult. What local records do exist are with the Otoƒçac registrars office. This office has access to computerised BDM records from 1910 onwards for the Otoƒçac area, although it is not known how complete these records are. Some older books were moved to the Gospiƒá registrars office the contents of which have not been digitised. Although limited in age, these records do however offer the possibility of finding the names of ancestors born from the early 19th century onwards if they passed after 1910 as well as their parents' names on the death record. The whereabouts of the Zalu≈ænica church records is unknown, although the church survives intact since it was rebuilt in its current form in 1753. The most readily available resources are in the countries Zalu≈ænica people migrated to. These include records for immigration, BDM, naturalisation, etc. Much of this is available online albeit normally at a cost, for example, at www.ancestry.com, although there are free websites such as Ellis Island and www.familyseach.org. Each country will have its own national archives and there are many other niche online information sources such as obituaries and graveyard records. The main issue in finding ancestors in these \\"foreign\\" records is the misspelling of names and places particularly in the digital records transcribed from the microfiche of the original handwritten documents. While websites offer some level of 'fuzzy' name searches, in many cases it requires patient review of many records of similarly named persons and the associated images (of original records) page by page. Where names and surnames were changed to aid assimilation in the new countries, the ability to trace ancestors through official records is made even more difficult. Another important resource is Austrian Army records which date from around the mid-18th century to WW1. Some records exist for the various regiments that were located in Krajina and are held at the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb. Some of these records can be viewed at www.familyseach.org, although it is not known if this published collection is all the records from the Archive. You need to register with the website (free of charge). To find these army records choose the 'Catalog' option at the home page. Select the 'author' search term and type 'osterreich armee'. Again, it is not known if this 'search' finds all the Austrian Army records, but there are a substantial number. To find the relevant part of the army records you will need to know a little of the history of the Army. From 1744 to 1872 the Lika-based regiments were known as the 'Grenzer' regiments so for the 'Lika' regiment the relevant set of records scroll down the 'armee' list until you find '√ñsterreich. Armee. Grenzinfanterie Regiment 01'. The Otoƒçac regiment records are immediately below this under '√ñsterreich. Armee. Grenzinfanterie Regiment 02'. From 1873, these regiments changed, so the Otocac regiment became known as the IR.79 and some can be found from the main 'armee' search list under '√ñsterreich. Armee. Infanterie Regiment 079'. Please note that any records in this section for the IR.79 before 1873 are not relevant to Lika. Within each set of published records there are inconsistencies. There are many instances of 'Lika' and 'Ogulin' regiment records mixed in with 'Otoƒçac' regiment records. Until the start of WW1 the army books were written in German cursive writing, some neater than others. When printed headings started to appear they are still mainly in the German cursive style. Their records have not been transcribed and therefore requires review of every image, of which there are thousands. In a lot of cases the village of origin of a soldier is recorded and to a lesser extent his DoB. In fewer cases, there are a few details of the soldier's children. Further information about the format of these army records and some translations of the form headings will be posted at a later date. The Austrian Army WW1 casualty lists called 'Verlustliste' are also available online and can be found on a number of free websites, for example, Verlustliste. As the original documents were typed and the Army records fairly accurate, most names are spelt correctly and therefore the 'search' function on the website is fairly accurate. In many cases, it lists the soldier's village (or the closest regiment command post) and date of birth in addition to name, rank, regiment, casualty status and for POWs some list the name of the POW camp. There are only a few entries that list Zalu≈ænica as the village of origin, as Zalu≈ænica soldiers listed the command post at which they enrolled. In order of frequency this is Vrhovine, ≈†kare and Octoƒçac. From 1815 to 1873, Zalu≈ænica was part of the Vrhovine company within the Otoƒçac Grenzer regiment. The online resource at Croatia Church Records has a subset of 'Orthodox' Lika village church records, but only includes one or two specific years. For whatever reason 1833 and 1856 are the most common. There are no records for Zalu≈ænica, but there are for ≈†kare and Gornja Vrhovine. These may help in discovering any Zalu≈ænica ancestors who married into these or other villages. Again, these records are not transcribed. They are difficult to read as the documents are a mix of printed and handwritten text in an archaic form of Cyrillic and in the language of the day. The 1833 records are unstructured making it even more difficult to transcribe, whereas those of 1856 and similar years are based on a standardised form. The available records for Gornja Vrhovine have been transcribed by the author and will be posted in the near future. A useful resource is Radoslav Grujic 'Plemenski rjecnik licko-krbavske zupanije'Try an internet search to locate it. published in 1915 it lists family surnames and the Lika village in which they were found. Other snippets of information about the village and its population can be found on the internet, but the source is rarely stated making them somewhat inconclusive. Autosomal DNA tests offer the possibility of finding ancestral relationships, although without knowledge of respective family trees it is very difficult to confirm DNA relationships beyond second cousins. It is further complicated as Lika exhibits the characteristics of an endogamous community. In practice, this means that people often find they are related through both parents (where both parents are from Lika). However, as more people take the test the possibility of finding DNA linkages and relatives will increase substantially. To preserve the heritage and culture of the Zalu≈ænica and related people, the author encourages publication of family trees, however small, and Autosomal DNA tests to establish ancestral relationships.

He was nicknamed Hissing Sid by colleagues, and described by The Guardian newspaper in 1999 as \\"Britain's most notorious paedophile\\".Paul Kelso \\"Cooke admits years of child abuse\\", The Guardian. 6 October 1999 Early life After working as a farm labourer, Cooke found a job as a fairground worker by the 1960s, which allowed him to travel around the UK easily. As part of his system to lure in young boys, Cooke set up a child's version of the \\"Test Your Strength\\" amusement. \\"Dirty Dozen\\" In the 1970s, Cooke and a group of paedophiles began hiring rent boys and taking young boys off the streets, who were then drugged, raped and abused in group orgies. By the mid-1980s, the group had acquired a flat on the Kingsmead estate in Hackney, East London. Gang rape and murder of Jason Swift In November 1985, a group led by Cooke had each paid ¬£5 to gang-rape 14-year-old Jason Swift in what the media described as a homosexual orgy.Child killers change name to escape register After his body was found in a shallow grave by a dog walker, an investigation by the Metropolitan Police led to the arrest of Cooke, along with three accomplices ‚Äì Leslie Bailey, Robert Oliver and Steven Barrell. Cooke was sentenced at the Old Bailey to 19 years in Wandsworth Prison on 12 May 1989https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/07/timeline-sidney-cooke-and- associates/ for the manslaughter of Swift. Oliver received a lesser sentence of 15 years but was released from prison after eight years, and changed his name to Karl Curtis. In July 2013, he was jailed for three years after being found guilty of luring children into his home in Maidstone, Kent. This was due to the breach of a court order which banned him from having unsupervised contact with children. Murder of Mark Tildesley Bailey had informed authorities that Cooke was among those who murdered 7-year-old Mark Tildesley in Wokingham, Berkshire. Tildesley disappeared while visiting a funfair in Wokingham on the evening of 1 June 1984. Bailey said that Tildesley was lured away from the fair by Cooke for the promise of a 50p bag of sweets. His bicycle was found chained to railings nearby. Cooke's role in the murder was not investigated until 1999; by this time, Bailey was dead, having been murdered in prison in October 1993. In 1991, the Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute Cooke for Tildesley's murder as he was already in prison for the manslaughter of Swift. Cooke has indicated he knows where Tildesley's body is buried, but refuses to tell the police, or the boy's family, the exact location. Appeal and parole Cooke's sentence for the murder of Swift was reduced to 16 years on appeal in 1989, and he was paroled nine years later from Wandsworth Prison in April 1998.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/80182.stm He told an appeals court that Bailey was the ringleader of the gang, who are believed to have killed at least nine victims. Cooke's parole caused huge public outrage. This was exacerbated by a plan to move him to a hostel near two schools, and Cooke himself admitted that he might re-offend if he was released. While in prison, he refused to take part in any rehabilitation sessions. Police refused to disclose the location to where he was to be moved, smuggling him out of prison to avoid a vigil for his victims. For the next 10 months Cooke lived in a suite of cells at Yeovil Police Station at his own request, rarely venturing out in public.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/570385.stm 1970s offences, re- arrest Following an investigation by the Channel 4 documentary programme Dispatches on 29 October 1998 Thames Valley Police began the reinvestigation of a series of rape and other serious sexual offences against young boys.On 26 January 1999, Cooke was arrested by Thames Valley Police. Three days later he was charged at Reading police station with committing 18 sex offences which occurred between 1972 and 1981 in Battersea and Stockwell in south London; Twyford, Berks; Canterbury, Kent; Washington, Tyne and Wear and Hatfield, Berkhamsted and Tring in Herts.https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/07/timeline-sidney-cooke- and-associates He was moved back to prison on remand.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/30/jamiewilsonThese included repeated abuse and assault of two brothers and the rape of a young woman.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/30/jamiewilsonMany of the offences had come to public attention after they were disclosed in the Channel 4 documentary. At his trial at Manchester Crown Court on 5 October 1999, Cooke pleaded guilty to sexually abusing the two brothers on ten occasions in 1972 and 1973. He admitted to having carried out five counts of indecent assault and five counts of buggery committed between 1972 and 1978 but denied the remaining eight charges, which were four counts of rape, three further counts of indecent assault, and one of buggery that occurred in 1981. These were abandoned by the judge, who ordered them to lie on file. Following Cooke's sentencing, NSPCC director Jim Harding said: On 17 December 1999, at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Cooke received two life sentences, and judge David Poole told Cooke that he would only be considered for release after he had served a minimum of five years in prison and if the Parole Board was satisfied he was not a danger to the public.

Black was convicted of the kidnapping, rape and murder of three girls on 19 May 1994. He was also convicted of the kidnapping of a fourth girl, and had earlier been convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a fifth. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 35 years. Black was further convicted of the 1981 sexual assault and murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy in 2011, and at the time of his death was regarded as the prime suspect in the 1978 disappearance and murder of 13-year-old Genette Tate. Black may also have been responsible for several other unsolved child murders throughout Britain, Ireland and continental Europe between 1969 and 1987. The nationwide manhunt for Black was one of the most exhaustive UK murder investigations of the 20th century. He died of a heart attack at HMP Maghaberry in 2016 aged 68. Early life=Childhood Robert Black was born in Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, on 21 April 1947, the illegitimate child of Jessie Hunter Black and an unknown father. His mother originally planned to have him adopted before she emigrated to Australia to escape the stigma of his birth. He was not adopted, and at six months old was placed with an experienced, middle-aged foster couple in Kinlochleven named Tulip. He adopted their surname. Black showed antisocial tendencies and became known as an aggressive child with few friends. He was prone to tantrums and vandalised school property. He was also a target for bullying among children his own age, and became a bully towards younger children. Though his foster mother insisted upon cleanliness, he cared little for his own hygiene and was called \\"Smelly Bobby Tulip\\" by classmates. At the age of five, Black and a girl the same age compared their genitalia, triggering a childhood belief within Black that he should have been born female, and he developed a deep interest in his genitalia, the genitals of female children, and body orifices. From the age of eight he would regularly insert objects in his own anus, a practice he carried into adulthood. Locals later recalled seeing bruises on Black's face and limbs, suggesting he had been physically abused by his foster parents. Black stated he could not recollect their origin, and they may have resulted from childhood fights. Despite being adamant he could not recall the origin of these bruises, Black was a chronic bed wetter, and freely admitted to being berated and beaten by his foster mother for each offence. By 1958, the Tulips had both died, and he was placed with another foster family in Kinlochleven. He soon committed his first known sexual assault, dragging a young girl into a public lavatory and fondling her. His foster mother reported the offence and insisted he be removed from her home. Adolescence Black was placed in a mixed-sex children's home on the outskirts of Falkirk. Here he regularly exposed himself to girls, and on one occasion, he forcibly removed the underwear of a girl. As a result, he was sent to Red House Care Home, a high- discipline, all-male establishment in Musselburgh. At this new location Black was sexually abused by a male staff member for three years; typically by being forced to perform fellatio. During this time he studied at Musselburgh Grammar School, developing an interest in football and swimming. Other students recall him as taciturn, with few friends. In 1963, Black left the Red House Care Home. With assistance from child welfare agencies, he moved to another boys' home in Greenock and obtained a job as a butcher's delivery boy. He later said that he had fondled thirty to forty young girls while making deliveries if, upon calling at the house, he discovered young girls were alone in the premises. None of these incidents seem to have been reported. First conviction On a summer evening in 1963, Black encountered a seven-year-old girl playing alone in a park; he lured the child to a deserted air-raid shelter on the pretext of showing her some kittens. There he held the girl by the throat until she lost consciousness, then masturbated over her body. The following day, Black was arrested and charged with lewd and libidinous behaviour. A psychiatric examination suggested the incident was an isolated one, and that Black was not in need of treatment; as a result he was admonished for the offence. Shortly after, Black moved to Grangemouth, where he lodged with an elderly couple and worked for a builders' supply company. He began dating a young woman he met at a local youth club. This was his only known girlfriend, and they dated for several months. According to Black, he had asked this woman to marry him, and was devastated when she abruptly ended their relationship, in part due to his unusual sexual demands. In 1966, Black's landlords discovered he had molested their nine-year-old granddaughter whenever she visited their household. They evicted him but did not inform police, wanting to spare their granddaughter further trauma. Black lost his job soon after, and he returned to Kinlochleven, where he lodged with a married couple who had a six-year-old daughter. Borstal sentence Within a year, Black's landlords informed police that he had repeatedly molested their daughter. He pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault against a child. He was sentenced to a year at Polmont Borstal in Brightons, which specialised in training and rehabilitating of serious youthful offenders. Although he later spoke freely about every aspect of his youth and adolescence‚Äîincluding the sexual abuse he had suffered at the Red House Care Home‚Äîhe refused to discuss Polmont Borstal beyond saying he had vowed to never again be imprisoned; this has led to speculation that he may have been brutalised there. Relocation to London In September 1968, six months after his release from Polmont Borstal, Black moved to London, where he initially found lodgings in a bedsit close to King's Cross station. Between 1968 and 1970, he supported himself through various‚Äîoften casual‚Äîjobs. One of these was as a lifeguard at a Hornsey swimming pool, where he was soon fired for fondling a young girl; no charges were brought. Via a contact he had met at a King's Cross bookshop, Black began to collect child pornography. Initially, much of this material was in magazine and photograph format, although he later expanded this material to include videos depicting graphic child sexual abuse. As Black was a keen photographer, he sometimes also discreetly photographed children (mostly girls between eight and twelve) at locations such as swimming pools; he stored these images alongside his pornographic material in locked suitcases. Black frequented the Three Crowns, a Stamford Hill pub, where he became known as a proficient darts player. There he also met a Scottish couple, Edward and Kathy Rayson. In 1972, he moved into their attic. The Raysons considered Black a responsible if somewhat reclusive tenant who gave them no cause for complaint beyond his poor hygiene. They suspected Black of viewing pornographic material, but had no idea it might be paedophilic. Black remained their lodger until his arrest in 1990. Long-distance driving employment To increase his scope for casual work, in the mid-1970s Black bought a white Fiat van to enable him to commit to driving for a living. In 1976, Black obtained a permanent job as a van driver for Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd, a Hoxton-based firm whose fleet delivered posters‚Äîtypically depicting pop stars‚Äîand billboard advertisements to locations across the UK, Ireland and continental Europe. To his employers, Black was a conscientious employee who was willing to undertake the long-distance deliveries some of his married co-workers disliked. While working as a driver, Black developed a thorough knowledge of much of the UK road network, subsequently enabling him to snatch children across the entire country and dispose of their bodies hundreds of miles from the site of their abduction. To reduce the chance of being identified by eyewitnesses, Black often adjusted his appearance by alternately growing a beard or appearing clean-shaven, and occasionally shaved his head completely bald. Black also owned over a dozen pairs of spectacles, and would wear a pair significantly different from those he regularly wore when abducting children. He also covered the rear windows of his van with opaque black curtains. First murders Jennifer Cardy Jennifer Cardy The first murder Black is proven to have committed was that of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, who was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered on 12 August 1981. Cardy was last seen by her mother at 1:40 p.m. as she cycled to a friend's house in Ballinderry, County Antrim; she never arrived. Hours later, Cardy's bicycle was discovered less than a mile from her home, covered with branches and leaves. The stand of the bicycle was down, suggesting that she had stopped her bicycle to converse with her abductor. A search aided by 200 volunteers found nothing further. Six days later, two anglers discovered Cardy's body in a reservoir near a lay-by in Hillsborough, from her home. A pathologist noted signs of sexual abuse on Cardy's body and underwear; the autopsy concluded she had died of drowning‚Äîmost likely accompanied by ligature strangulation. The watch she had been wearing had stopped at 5:40 pm. The location of the body near a major arterial road between Belfast and Dublin led police to suspect her murderer had been familiar with the area. The reservoir in which her body was found was near a route frequented by long-distance delivery drivers, and visible only yards away from the lay-by, suggesting that her killer may have travelled extensively upon this route. A697 towards Cornhill-on-Tweed. Black is believed to have abducted Susan Maxwell as she walked along this road on 30 July 1982 Susan Maxwell Black's second confirmed victim was 11-year-old Susan Claire Maxwell, who lived in Cornhill- on-Tweed on the English side of the Anglo-Scottish border. Maxwell was abducted on 30 July 1982 as she walked home from playing tennis in Coldstream. She was last seen alive at 4:30 pm, crossing the bridge over the River Tweed, and was likely abducted by Black shortly after. The following day a search was mounted. Search dogs were used, and at peak 300 officers were assigned full- time; a thorough search was made of every property in both Cornhill and Coldstream and over 80 square miles of terrain. Several people reported having seen a white van in the locality; one said a van had been parked in a field gateway off the A697. On 12 August, Maxwell's body was found by a lorry driver; her body was covered with undergrowth, and was clothed save for her shoes and underwear. The precise date and cause of her death could not be determined due to decomposition. Maxwell had been bound, and gagged with sticking plaster, and her underwear had been removed and folded beneath her head, suggesting that she had been sexually assaulted. A coroner's inquest concluded Maxwell had died shortly after being abducted. Evidently, Maxwell remained in Black's van‚Äîalive or dead‚Äîfor over 24 hours, as his delivery schedule encompassed Edinburgh, Dundee, and finally Glasgow, where he made his final delivery close to midnight on 30 July. The following day, Black returned from Glasgow to London, discarding the body in a copse beside the A518 road near Uttoxeter, from where Maxwell had been abducted. Caroline Hogg Five-year-old Caroline Hogg, Black's youngest known victim, disappeared while playing outside her Beach Lane home in the Edinburgh suburb of Portobello in the early evening of 8 July 1983. When she failed to return home by 7:15 pm, her family searched the surrounding streets. A boy told them he had seen Caroline with a man on the nearby promenade, which they searched before calling Lothian and Borders Police. The ensuing search was the largest in Scottish history at the time, with 2,000 local volunteers and 50 members of the Royal Scots Fusilierssearching first Portobello, then expanding their scope to all of Edinburgh. By 10 July, Hogg's disappearance was headline news across the UK. Nine known paedophiles were identified as having been in Portobello on 8 July; all were eliminated from the inquiry. Numerous eyewitnesses had seen an unkempt, balding, \\"furtive-looking\\" man wearing horn- rimmed glasses, watching Hogg as she played; then following her to a nearby fairground. En route, a 14-year-old girl named Jennifer Booth had seen Hogg sitting with this man on a bench. Booth overheard Hogg reply \\"Yes please\\" to some question posed to her by the man before the two walked to the fairground holding hands. There, the man paid 15 pence for Caroline to ride a carousel as he watched. A witness stated to police that as they left, Caroline seemed frightened. Hogg remained in Black's van for at least 24 hours. Black delivered posters to Glasgow several hours after the abduction, and refuelled his van in Carlisle early the following morning. On 18 July, Hogg's naked body was found in a ditch close to the M1 motorway in Twycross, from where she had been abducted and just from where Maxwell's body had been found the previous year. The precise cause of death could not be determined due to the extent of decomposition. Insect activity suggested the body had been placed where it was found on or after 12 July; Black had made a delivery to Bedworth on that date. The absence of clothing again suggested a sexual motive. The following March, a televised reconstruction of the abduction was broadcast nationally. Appealing for witnesses to come forward, Hogg's father said: \\"You think it can never happen to you, but it has proven time and time again that it can, and it could again if this man isn't caught in the near future.\\"True Crime August 1994 p. 3 Coordinated task force After the discovery of Hogg's body, a conference of senior Staffordshire and Leicestershire detectives unanimously concluded that Hogg's and Maxwell's murderers were the same person, to a large degree because of the distance between the abduction and discovery sites. (Cardy's murder was not linked to this series until 2009.) Due to the distances involved, police suspected that the murderer of Maxwell and Hogg worked as a lorry or van driver, or a sales representative, which required him to travel extensively to locations which included the Scottish Borders. Both girls had been bound and likely subjected to a sexual assault prior to the murders, and each had been wearing white ankle socks at the time of her abduction, which may have triggered a fetish in the perpetrator's psyche. Due to the geographical and circumstantial nature of the offences, the killer was most likely an opportunist. Based upon the day of the week when Maxwell and Hogg had been abducted (a Friday), the killer was likely tied to a delivery or production schedule. Following the August 1982 discovery of Maxwell's body, numerous transport firms with links between Scotland and the Midlands of England were contacted, and drivers were questioned about their whereabouts on the date of her abduction. This line of inquiry was repeated following the discovery of Hogg's body, but in both instances failed to yield results. Despite frustration at the lack of a breakthrough in their search for the murderer, there was complete cooperation between the detectives from the four police forces involved in the manhunt. Initially, a satellite incident room in Coldstream coordinated the efforts of the forces involved in the hunt for Maxwell's killer, with incident rooms in Leith and Portobello coordinating the search for Hogg's; within hours of Hogg's body being discovered, the chief constables of all forces now involved in investigating the murders agreed to appoint a senior investigating officer to coordinate the inquiries. Hector Clark, the assistant chief constable of Northumbria Police, took overall charge of the investigation. Clark established incident rooms in Northumberland and Leith police stations, to liaise between the four police forces involved. HOLMES database All information relating to both child murders was initially logged within a card filing system, which contained 500,000 index cards relating to the Maxwell case alone. Mindful of the criticisms of the recent investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper, which had become overwhelmed due to the volume of information filed in a card filing system, one of Clark's first decisions upon taking overall charge of the murder investigation was to introduce computer technology into the investigation; he and other senior officers agreed that the most efficient way to cooperate in an investigation of this scope was to collate their information on the Hogg murder into a computerised database, which all forces involved in the manhunt could access. Information relating to Maxwell's murder was also later entered onto this database. By January 1987, all information relating to the murders initially linked to Black was entered into the newly established HOLMES information technology system, with the ¬£250,000 cost to implement it provided by the Home Office. Information continued to be entered into the database, and police forces nationwide could cross-check all data fed into this system. This database‚Äîbased at the Child Murder Bureau in Bradford‚Äîexpanded to hold information upon over 189,000 people, 220,000 vehicles, and details of interviews held with over 60,000 people. Much of the information came through three confidential hotlines established in 1984. As a result of the investigation into the killings, several unrelated crimes, including offences relating to child abuse, were solved. Morley. Sarah Harper is believed to have been abducted from one of the alleyways leading to this street on 26 March 1986 Sarah Harper At about 7:50 p.m. on 26 March 1986, 10-year-old Sarah Jayne Harper disappeared from the Leeds suburb of Morley, having left her home to buy a loaf of bread from a corner shop 100 yards (metres) from her home. The owner of the shop confirmed that Harper had bought a loaf of bread and two packets of crisps from her at 7:55 pm, and that a balding man had briefly entered the shop moments later, then left as Harper made her purchases. Sarah Harper was last seen alive by two girls walking into an alley leading towards her Brunswick Place home; when she had not returned by 8:20 pm, her mother, Jackie, and younger sister, Claire, briefly searched the surrounding streets, before Jackie Harper reported her daughter missing to West Yorkshire Police. Immediately, an extensive search was launched to find the child. Over 100 police officers were assigned full-time to the search, which saw house-to-house inquiries across Morley, over 3,000 properties searched, more than 10,000 leaflets distributed, and 1,400 witness statements obtained. A police search of the surrounding land was bolstered by 200 local volunteers, and a reservoir in nearby Tingley was searched by underwater units. Extensive inquiries by West Yorkshire Police established that a white Ford Transit van had been in the area where Harper had been abducted. Two suspicious men had been seen loitering near the route Harper would have taken to the corner shop, and one of them was stocky and balding. Mindful of the possibility Harper had been abducted and murdered, West Yorkshire Police dispatched a telex to all forces nationwide, requesting that they search all locations where they had previously discovered child murder victims. At a press conference on 3 April, Sarah's mother, Jackie, informed journalists that she feared her daughter was dead, and that the worst torment she and her family endured was the uncertainty. She made a direct appeal to her daughter's abductor to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter's body, stating: \\"I just want her back, even if she's dead. If someone would just pick up the phone and tell us where the body is.\\" On 19 April, a man discovered Sarah's partially dressed, gagged and bound body floating in the River Trent near Nottingham, from the site of her abduction. An autopsy showed she had died between five and eight hours after she was last seen alive, and that the cause of her death was drowning; injuries she had received to her face, forehead, head and neck had most likely rendered her unconscious prior to being thrown into the water. Harper had also been the victim of a violent and sustained sexual assault prior to being thrown into the river, causing pre-mortem internal injuries which were described by the pathologist as \\"simply terrible\\". Days after Harper's body had been found, a further witness contacted West Yorkshire Police to say that at approximately 9:15 p.m. on 26 March, he had seen a white van with a stocky, balding man standing by the passenger door, parked close to the River Soar. As the Soar is a tributary to the Trent, and the description of the vehicle and driver matched those obtained from Morley residents, investigators took this eyewitness account seriously. Black refuelled his van in Newport Pagnell the following afternoon, and it is likely that he had driven Harper to Ratcliffe on Soar, and discarded her body in the Soar in the late evening of the date of her abduction, or the early hours of the following day. Realising the likelihood that Harper's murderer had travelled on the M1 motorway prior to disposing of her body in the river, and that he would have had to refuel his vehicle as he made this journey, officers from both West Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire Police questioned staff and motorists at all service stations on the M1 motorway between Woolley, West Yorkshire and Trowell, Nottinghamshire, asking whether they had noted anything unusual on 26 or 27 March. Staff at one station had noted a white Transit van which had seemed out of place on the evening of 26 March, but could not give a clear description of the driver. Link to series Detective John Stainthorpe, head of the Leeds South Division of West Yorkshire Police, initially stated his doubt that Harper's disappearance was linked to those of Maxwell and Hogg: in one interview, he said that although he would not discount the possibility, he believed that Harper's abductor had close, personal connections with Morley. Upon the discovery of her body in the River Trent, he revised his opinion. Numerous similarities linked the murder of Sarah Harper to those of Maxwell and Hogg: she had been a prepubescent, white female, abducted from Northern England and found murdered in the Midlands. All three victims had been discovered within of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, with little effort being made to conceal the bodies. Despite these similarities, several investigators initially doubted whether Harper's murder should be linked to the series due to the differences in the circumstances of her abduction and the fact that the child had been subjected to a serious sexual assault prior to her murder, whereas decomposition had erased any such clear traces on the bodies of the two previous victims. Harper had been abducted on a rainy Wednesday evening from a suburb in the north of England, wearing a hooded anorak covering much of her face, as opposed to being abducted on a summer Friday afternoon in southern Scotland while wearing summer clothing. Investigators remained open- minded as to whether Harper's murder had been committed by the same person, and telephone and computer connections were established between the incident room in the Leeds district of Holbeck and Leith. Harper's murder was formally linked to the series in November 1986. National manhunt Following the murder of Sarah Harper, with six police forces now involved in the hunt for the offender, the police forces involved in the manhunt agreed that Hector Clark (by this time Deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police) should maintain overall command of the investigation. Clark created a new headquarters in Wakefield to act as a liaison between the six forces. On 21 April 1986, the head of Scotland Yard's Criminal Intelligence Branch, Phillip Corbett, hosted a summit meeting at Scotland Yard, to discuss how best to share information between the forces involved in the manhunt, and to investigate potential links with 19 other unsolved child murders. Senior officers attended from 16 UK police forces. At this stage, the inquiry had cost in excess of a million pounds. One of the outcomes of this meeting was that investigators contacted the FBI to request that they compose a psychological profile of the murderer for UK investigators. The FBI completed this profile in early 1988. For the HOLMES database, investigators concluded only those with convictions for serious sexual offences against children would warrant further investigation. Those to be checked were to have been convicted of child murder, child abduction or attempted child abduction, or the indecent assault of a child. Every police force in the UK was asked to check their databases for people who had received convictions for any of these offences within 10 years of the 1982 murder of Susan Maxwell. This narrowed the number of people to be checked to 40,000 men, and Black's name was not on the list, as his sole conviction had been in 1967. In January 1988, the UK investigators received the psychological profile of the killer from the FBI. This profile described the killer as a white male aged between 30 and 40 (likely closer to 40), who was a classic loner. This offender would be unkempt in appearance,True Crime August 1994 p. 14 and had received less than 12 years of formal education. He likely lived alone, in rented accommodation, in a lower- middle class neighbourhood. This profile also deduced that the motive for the child killings was sexual, that the offender held a fixation with child pornography, that he retained souvenirs from his victims, and he most likely engaged in necrophilia with his victims' bodies shortly after their death, before disposing of them. Teresa Thornhill On 23 April 1988, an attempted abduction of a teenage girl occurred in the Nottingham district of Radford which was not initially deemed by Nottinghamshire Police to be linked to the three child killings, and thus remained unreported to Clark or senior investigators in the national manhunt, despite the fact that all chief constables across the UK had been requested to report incidents of this nature to the inquiry team. The victim of this attempted abduction was Teresa Thornhill, a 15-year-old who was tall, which may have led Black to think she was younger than she was. That evening, Thornhill had been at a social gathering in a local park with her boyfriend, Andrew Beeston, and other teenagers, before walking home with Beeston. The pair had parted company at the end of Norton Street when Thornhill noted a blue Transit van slowing to a stop ahead of her; the driver of this van then got out, raised the van's bonnet and asked Thornhill, \\"Can you fix engines?\\" When Thornhill replied that she could not and began walking at a much brisker pace, Black clasped his arms across her mouth and navel and attempted to drag her into his vehicle. Thornhill resisted him: writhing and kicking as she attempted to free herself from what she later described as his \\"bear hug\\" grasping of her body. As her would-be abductor wrestled her to his van, Thornhill squeezed his testicles, causing him to loosen his grasp sufficiently enough for her to bite into his right forearm. Black shouted, \\"Oh! You... bitch!\\", as Thornhill began to scream for her mother, wedging her feet on each side of the door frame as she struggled to resist being forced into the van. At the same time, Beeston ran towards the van shouting, \\"Let go of her, you fat bastard!\\" Upon hearing this, Black loosened his grip on Thornhill, who fell into the road, sobbing. Black himself ran towards the driver's seat of his van and rapidly drove away from the scene. Both Thornhill and Beeston ran to Thornhill's home and informed her parents what had occurred; they immediately reported the attempted abduction to Nottinghamshire Police, who questioned both youngsters. Both Thornhill and Beeston described her would-be abductor as an unkempt, overweight, balding and heavily built man aged between 40 and 50, and about in height. Stow. Black was arrested close to this location on 14 July 1990 Capture Black was arrested in Stow on 14 July 1990. David Herkes, a 53-year-old retired postmaster, was mowing his front garden when he saw a blue Transit van slow to a standstill across the road. The driver exited the van‚Äîostensibly to clean his windscreen‚Äîas the six-year-old daughter of Herkes' neighbour passed his field of view. As Herkes stooped to clear grass cuttings from his lawnmower, he saw the girl's feet lifting from the pavement; he then straightened himself to observe the vehicle's driver hastily pushing something through the passenger door before clambering across to the driver's seat, closing the passenger door, and starting the engine. Realising he had witnessed an abduction, Herkes noted the registration number of the van as it sped away. Herkes ran to the girl's home; the girl's mother called police. Within minutes, six police vehicles had arrived in the village. As Herkes described the van to officers, he observed it driving in their direction and exclaimed, \\"That's him! That's the same van!\\" An officer jumped in the van's path, forcing it to halt. Police removed the driver from his seat and handcuffed him. One of the officers, who was the father of the abducted girl, opened the rear of the van and clambered inside, calling his daughter's name. Seeing movement in a sleeping bag, he untied its drawstring to discover his daughter inside, her wrists bound behind her back, her legs tied together, her mouth bound and gagged with sticking plaster, and a hood tied over her head.British Serial Killers pp. 348‚Äì349 En route to Selkirk police station, Black said: \\"It was a rush of blood to the head; I have always liked little girls since I was a lad. I tied her up because I wanted to keep her until I had dropped a parcel off. I was going to let her go.\\" Black claimed he had interfered with his victim only \\"a little\\". A doctor found the victim had been subjected to a serious sexual assault. The girl was able to pinpoint the lay-by on the A7 where Black had sexually assaulted her. Black's intention had been to quickly make a final scheduled delivery to Galashiels before further abusing and almost certainly killing his victim. Investigation and charges At Selkirk police station, Black admitted to sexually assaulting the girl, saying he had not done more to her because he \\"didn't have much time\\". He was charged with plagium, and held on remand. As Black awaited a scheduled 16 July Selkirk Sheriff court appearance, the detective superintendent‚Äînoting the similarities between the Stow abduction and the three child killings‚Äînotified Hector Clark of Black's arrest. On 16 July, Clark travelled from Wakefield to interview Black at Edinburgh's St Leonards police station. Although Black's answers in this brief interview were largely monosyllabic, Clark left feeling that Black was the man he had sought since 1982. At Black's initial remand hearing he was ordered to stand trial at Edinburgh High Court for the abduction of the Stow girl; he was then transferred to Saughton Prison. A search of Black's van found restraining devices including assorted ropes, sticking plaster, and hoods; a Polaroid camera; numerous articles of girls' clothing; a mattress; and a selection of sexual aids. Black claimed that on his long-distance deliveries he would pull into a lay-by and dress in the children's clothing before masturbating; he gave no plausible explanation for the sexual aids. At the request of Scottish detectives, Black's Stamford Hill lodgings were searched by the Metropolitan Police. This search yielded a large collection of child pornography in magazine, book, photographic and video format, including 58 videos and films depicting graphic child sexual abuse which Black later claimed to have bought in continental Europe. Also found were several items of children's clothing, a semen-stained copy of a Nottingham newspaper detailing the 1988 attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and a variety of sex aids. Black's appointed defence lawyer, Herbert Kerrigan QC, and the Edinburgh procurator fiscal both ordered psychiatric evaluations of Black, which were undertaken by prominent psychiatrists. Both reports were uncompromising regarding Black's deviancy and proclivities towards children. Black told Kerrigan he intended to plead guilty to the abduction charges. Abduction trial On 10 August 1990, Black was tried for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. He was tried at the Edinburgh High Court before Lord Donald MacArthur Ross. The trial lasted one day. In his opening statement, Kerrigan stated his client would plead guilty to all charges. The Lord Advocate of Scotland, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC then outlined the facts of the case, terming the implements found in Black's van a clear sign of premeditation, and citing a medical expert's testimony that the girl would likely have suffocated within 15 minutes had she not been rescued. Testimony was given that Black drove his victim to a lay-by to sexually abuse her, then returned through the village. In a statement read to the court, the victim stated she \\"didn't know [Black] was a bad man\\" as Black had stared at her before bundling her into his van. In rebuttal, Kerrigan asserted again that the abduction had been unplanned, and that Black had intended to release the girl after assaulting her. He pointed out that Black freely admitted his paedophilic preferences, and claimed to have successfully fought against the urge to abduct young girls prior to the incident at issue. He also said that Black accepted that he was a danger to children and wished to undergo treatment. Life imprisonment Prior to imposing sentence, Ross paid tribute to Herkes, whose vigilance had led to Black's arrest. Sentencing Black to life imprisonment for what he described as \\"a horrific, appalling case\\", Ross said he was greatly influenced by the opinion of the psychiatrists, who had concluded that Black was, and would remain, an extreme danger to children. In September 1990, Black announced his intention to appeal against his life sentence, but he later abandoned this. In November 1990, he was transferred to Peterhead Prison. Further investigation Two weeks after the Stow trial, Clark conducted a second, recorded interview with Black. He had appointed Andrew Watt and Roger Orr to conduct the interview, with instructions they were to tell Black that they would not be judgemental. In the six-hour interview, Black freely discussed his early sexual experiences, his experimentation with various forms of self-abuse, and his attraction towards young children; he also described his penchant for wearing young girls' clothing, and admitted to having sexually assaulted in excess of 30 young girls between the 1960s and 1980s. He was largely uncommunicative in response to questions even loosely pertaining to any unsolved child murders and disappearances, but said he had enticed two young girls into his van in Carlisle upon the pretext of asking for directions in late 1985, then allowed them to leave when eyewitnesses appeared. In the latter stages of this interview both men steered their questioning to the subject of child abduction and murder, specifically in relation to the murder of Caroline Hogg. Informing Black that police had already established he had been in Portobello on the date of Hogg's abduction, Watt and Orr then tacitly informed him they had eyewitness accounts and petrol-station receipts, further proving that he was near Portobello on the date of Hogg's abduction. Orr then produced a composite drawing of the man with whom Hogg had left the funfair, and placed this composite alongside photographs of Black dating from the early 1980s‚Äîhighlighting their similarities. Black's replies then became evasive and monosyllabic. Asked directly, at the end of the interview, to confess to end the suffering of his victims' families, he did not respond. Despite the fact the information gleaned in this interview did little to advance the murder inquiry, upon the conclusion of the interview, Clark informed his two colleagues: \\"That's our man. I'd bet my life on it.\\" Accumulation of evidence Detectives from all forces in the UK linked to the joint manhunt then began an intense and painstaking endeavour to gather sufficient evidence to convince the Crown Prosecution Service to instigate legal proceedings against Black, with a reasonable chance of securing convictions. As was his legal right, Black refused to cooperate with the detectives in their investigation. Investigators contacted Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd to establish whether travel records could confirm his whereabouts on crucial dates linked to the investigation. Staff at this firm were able to confirm that Black had always bought petrol using credit cards, the receipts of which he would then submit to his firm to claim expenses. These files, plus several historical delivery schedules, were still in the company's archives. Investigators discovered that Black had made scheduled delivery runs to the areas where the abductions had occurred on the relevant dates, and although the precise times he had been in the area were difficult to adduce, petrol receipts confirmed he had bought fuel close to where each girl had been abducted on the date of her disappearance. For example, on the date of Sarah Harper's disappearance, Black had been scheduled to make a series of deliveries across the Midlands and Northern England. The two final deliveries on this schedule had been in West Yorkshire: in Brighouse, then a final delivery in Morley at a firm 150 yards from Harper's home. Black had refuelled his van between these two destinations shortly before Harper had last been seen alive. Investigators discovered that upon his return to London from his long-distance deliveries to Northern England or Scotland, Black had regularly slept overnight in a house in Donisthorpe which belonged to his landlord's son. This was close to where all three bodies had been discovered. Leeds detectives also discovered that, on his regular deliveries to Morley, Black often slept in his van overnight in the premises to which he delivered, which was close to Sarah Harper's home. Investigators learned that Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd had accounts with several oil companies, which allowed their drivers to buy fuel. With the cooperation of the companies, investigators obtained seven million credit card slips archived on microfiche detailing fuel purchases paid via this method at every one of their nationwide premises between 1982 and 1986. These were sent to the reopened incident room in Newcastle upon Tyne, where a team of officers searched them for Black's distinctive signature in an effort to pinpoint precisely when and where he had bought his fuel. This laborious task bore fruit: beginning in October 1990, investigators began to discover evidence proving the precise times Black had bought fuel at petrol stations close to each abduction site. In each instance, the time of purchase had been shortly before or after each child had been abducted. By December 1990, the inquiry team decided they had sufficient circumstantial evidence to convince the Crown that there was a reasonable prospect of securing convictions against Black, although Clark was worried that the inquiry had not uncovered any forensic evidence to tie Black to the murders. All the evidence was submitted to the Crown in May 1991. In March 1992, Crown lawyers decided that the evidence was sufficient to try Black for the three murders and the attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill. At a news conference held on 11 March, Hector Clark informed the press that \\"criminal proceedings have been issued on the authority of the Crown Prosecution Service against Robert Black\\". Several pretrial hearings were held between July 1992 and March 1994; these hearings saw Black's defence counsel submit contentions that their client be tried on each count separately, and that the prosecution not be allowed to demonstrate any similarity between the modus operandi of each offence at the upcoming trial. In the penultimate pretrial hearing, in January 1994, Judge William Macpherson ruled against defence motions to try Black on each charge separately, and also ruled to allow the prosecution to submit similar fact evidence between the cases. This ruling allowed the prosecution to make these similarities between the cases known, and to introduce into evidence Black's recent conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. The prosecution was prohibited from introducing into evidence the transcript of the August 1990 interview between Black and detectives Watt and Orr. Moot Hall. Black was brought to trial at this location on 13 April 1994 Murder trials On 13 April 1994, Robert Black stood trial before Judge William Macpherson at Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne. Black pleaded not guilty to each of the 10 charges of kidnap, murder, attempted kidnap, and preventing the lawful burial of a body. In his opening statement on behalf of the Crown, prosecutor John Milford QC described the case to be tried as \\"every parent's nightmare\\" as he outlined the prosecution's contention that Robert Black had committed the three child murders and the attempted abduction, and the similarities between these offences and the 1990 abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl for which Black was already serving a life sentence. Milford then described the circumstances of each abduction and murder for the jury; contending that each victim had remained alive in Black's van for several hours before her murder, and that each had been killed near the location Black had disposed of her body. In the latter stages of this five-hour opening statement, Milford contended that Black had kidnapped each victim for his own sexual gratification, and pointed out Black's extensive record of child sexual abuse and the paraphernalia discovered in his vehicle and at his London address. Milford closed his speech by stating that the petrol receipts and travel records would prove Black had been at all the abduction, attempted abduction and body recovery sites on the dates in question. On the second day of the trial, the prosecution began to introduce witnesses, witness statements, circumstantial evidence, and forensic testimony. This saw witnesses describing the circumstances surrounding the abduction and subsequent discovery of each victim, and investigators describing the evidence uncovered of Black's movements on the dates of each abduction, the attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and the kidnapping and assault of the Stow schoolgirl. Contemporary statements made by the mother of each murder victim at the time of her child's abduction were also read to the court, alongside testimony from the pathologists who had examined the bodies. Upon hearing the details of the kidnaps and murders, relatives of the three murder victims wept openly in court. Black rarely displayed any interest throughout the proceedings, typically remaining expressionless. Several of these initial witnesses were subjected to intense cross-examination by Black's defence counsel, Ronald Thwaites, upon issues such as memory accuracy and minor discrepancies between times logged in record books at a firm to which Black had made a delivery on the date of Susan Maxwell's disappearance and those of petrol receipts introduced as evidence (this discrepancy was proven to be an administrative error), and earlier police statements given by the witnesses. Most witnesses maintained their insistence of the accuracy and honesty of their testimony. One of the witnesses cross-examined on the third day of the trial was James Fraser, a forensic scientist, who had examined more than 300 items recovered from Black's van and his London lodgings; Fraser conceded that in over 1,800 microscopic comparisons, no forensic link had been established between Black and the three victims. In direct re-examination by John Milford, Fraser said that the interval between the offences and Black's arrest, and the fact Black had only bought the van in which he was arrested in 1986, would make establishing a forensic link between the three murders unlikely. The final prosecution witnesses to testify were detectives from the police forces involved in the manhunt; they testified on 29 April, and much of their testimony described the scope of the investigation while Black had been at large, and the painstaking inquiries to gather evidence. The final detective to testify was Hector Clark, who testified that Black's name had never been entered into the HOLMES database during the manhunt due to his conviction pre- dating the timescale of those judged to warrant further investigation. Clark further explained he could not recall any other cases where children had been abducted, killed and their bodies transported considerable distances, before stating: \\"I don't believe there has been a bigger crime investigation in the United Kingdom, ever.\\" On 4 May, Ronald Thwaites began to outline his case in defence of Black. Thwaites reminded the jury the police had been unsuccessfully investigating these crimes for eight years before Black's 1990 arrest and conviction for the Stow abduction, and asserted that the investigators had seized on this case in an attempt to scapegoat his client to appease their feelings of \\"frustration and failure\\", and in an effort to restore broken reputations. Thwaites claimed that, although the paraphernalia introduced into evidence attested to his client's admitted obsession with paedophilic material,Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on the Internet p.190 no direct evidence existed to prove Black had progressed from molester to murderer. Describing his decision not to permit Black to testify on his own behalf in relation to the petrol receipts and travel records, Thwaites informed the jury: \\"No man can be expected to remember the ordinary daily routine of his life going back many years.\\" Thwaites then began to introduce witnesses to testify on behalf of the defence, and continued to do so until 10 May. To support Thwaites' contention that the three murders were not part of a series and had not been committed by Black, much of the testimony delivered by the defence witnesses referred to sightings of alternative suspects and suspicious vehicles near each abduction. The evidence delivered by these eyewitnesses contradicted that of those who had earlier testified on behalf of the prosecution. For example, Thomas Ball testified that on the date of Susan Maxwell's abduction, he had observed a girl matching her description striking a maroon Triumph saloon with a tennis racket. This car had contained at least two men, and the location Ball had seen this incident was very close to the site of Maxwell's abduction. Closing arguments On 12 May, both counsel delivered their closing arguments to the jury. Prosecutor John Milford argued first; opening his final address to the jury by describing the circumstances of Black's 1990 arrest and recounting the extensive circumstantial evidence presented throughout the trial, and emphasising the fact no physical evidence existed due to the interval between the offences and Black's arrest. In reference to the defence argument that Black's close proximity to each of the abduction and body disposal sites of the dates in question was mere coincidence, Milford stated that if this defence contention were true, it would be \\"the coincidence to end all coincidences\\". Milford then requested that the jury reach a guilty verdict. Thwaites delivered his closing arguments on behalf of the defence. He began by asking the jury: \\"Where is the jury that will acquit a pervert of multiple murder?\\" before describing his client as someone against whom ample prejudice existed, but no hard evidence. Thwaites pressed upon the jury the necessity to differentiate between a child sex pervert and an alleged child killer, before attacking the credibility of several prosecution witnesses, and pouring particular scorn upon the nationwide manhunt, stating: \\"The police have become exhausted in not finding anyone; the public are clamouring for a result. What good are you if you can't catch a child killer? Is he [Black] their salvation, or a convenient, expendable scapegoat?\\" Thwaites then referred to defence witness testimony which indicated someone else had committed the three murders, before resting his case. Judge Macpherson delivered his final instructions to the jury on 16 May and the following morning. In his final address, Judge Macpherson implored the jury to discard any emotion or personal distaste for Black's extensive history of sexual offences against children when considering their verdict, and not to prejudge his guilt because of his 1990 conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. Judge Macpherson further directed the jury to instead focus on the evidence presented at the trial and decide whether the \\"interlocking similarities\\" between the cases presented were sufficient to convince them of Black's guilt, before reminding them that any conclusions of guilt on one charge must not determine guilt on the remaining nine charges they were to debate. The jury then received strict instructions against reading newspapers, watching television or making any telephone calls, before retiring to consider their verdict. These deliberations continued for two days. First murder convictions On 19 May, the jury found Black guilty of three counts of kidnapping, three counts of murder, three counts of preventing the lawful burial of a body and‚Äîin relation to Teresa Thornhill‚Äîone count of attempted abduction. He was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for each of these counts, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 35 years on each of the three murder charges. These life sentences were to be served concurrently. Passing sentence, Judge Macpherson described Black as being the perpetrator of \\"offences which are unlikely ever to be forgotten and which represent a man at his most vile\\".True Crime August 1994 p. 12 Black remained unmoved upon receipt of this sentence, but as he prepared to leave the dock, he turned to the detectives from the various forces present at his sentencing who, since 1982, had been involved in his manhunt and proclaimed, \\"Tremendous. Well done, boys.\\" This statement caused several of the detectives to weep. Black was then taken to Wakefield prison, to begin his sentence in the segregation unit, as a Category A prisoner. Immediately following these convictions, the more than 20 detectives involved in the manhunt who had been present at his sentencing addressed the press assembled outside Moot Hall, with Hector Clark stating: \\"The tragedy is these three beautiful children who should never have died. Black is the most evil of characters and I hope there is not now or ever another one like him.\\" When asked his personal feelings towards Robert Black, Clark stated: \\"Black is a man of the most evil kind, but no longer important to me. I care not about him.\\" Fourth murder trial On 15 December 2009, Black was served with a summons to attend trial in Northern Ireland for the 1981 murder of Jennifer Cardy. He was charged the following day. Black's trial for the sexual assault and murder of Jennifer Cardy began at Armagh Crown Court on 22 September 2011. He was tried before Judge Ronald Weatherup, and acknowledged that he may have been in Northern Ireland on the date of Cardy's abduction, but pleaded not guilty to the charges. Circumstantial evidence attesting to Black's guilt of Cardy's murder had been obtained by Northern Ireland investigators searching through petrol receipts‚Äî560,000 in total‚Äîstored in his former employer's archives to ascertain Black's whereabouts on the dates surrounding the abduction and murder. Black's trial began with the prosecutor, Toby Hedworth, stating that the discovery of Black's signature upon these receipts was as good as signing his own confession. On the second day of the trial, prosecutors introduced into evidence petrol receipts proving he had been near Ballinderry on the date of her abduction. Further evidence presented at trial included a salary ledger proving Black had been paid ¬£50, which had only been given to drivers from his firm who made deliveries to Northern Ireland, and an order book confirming a delivery of billboard posters had been due near Ballinderry on the date of the abduction. Black was one of only two employees of Poster Dispatch and Storage Ltd willing to travel to Northern Ireland due to the Troubles, and travel records from all other drivers employed at this firm eliminated them from any culpability on the date of Cardy's abduction. The records also showed that, on the night of the abduction, Black had boarded an overnight ferry from Northern Ireland to Liverpool, before refuelling his van at Coventry the following day, en route to London. In an effort to discredit the prosecution's contention that Black had been making deliveries to Ireland, Black's defence counsel, David Spens, suggested on the fourth day of the trial the Coventry petrol receipt could only indicate Black had been making deliveries to Coventry on the day after Cardy's murder; in rebuttal, Toby Hedworth questioned a colleague of Black's, who confirmed the firm did not make deliveries to Coventry in the early 1980s. To further support the prosecution's contention that Cardy's murder had been committed by Black, Nathaniel Cary, a forensic pathologist, testified on the 11th day of the trial to the similarities between Cardy's abduction and murder, and that of Sarah Harper. Cary testified that the circumstances of the two girls' deaths were \\"remarkably similar\\", and that the injuries inflicted upon both girls' bodies strongly suggested both girls had been alive, albeit likely unconscious, when their bodies had been placed in water. Further conviction Black's second murder trial lasted six weeks, and the jury deliberated for four hours before delivering their verdict. On 27 October, he was found guilty of Cardy's abduction, sexual assault, and murder. Black was given a further life sentence, with hearings deferred on the minimum term to be served. On 8 December, Judge Weatherup imposed a minimum term of 25 years. Weatherup informed Black: \\"Your crime was particularly serious; you subjected a vulnerable child to unpardonable terror and took away her life.\\" Prior to his final sentencing for this fourth murder, Black's defence lawyer, David Spens, informed the court that no plea for mercy could be offered for his client, stating that the case in question was \\"one of those rare cases in which there is no mitigation, and so I propose to say nothing in that regard.\\" At his sentencing for his fourth murder, Black was informed that he would be at least 89 before he would be considered for release. Aftermath The eight-year, nationwide inquiry which culminated in the 1990 arrest of Robert Black proved to be one of the longest, most exhaustive and costly British murder investigations of the 20th century. By the time investigators had amassed sufficient evidence to convince the Crown to instigate criminal proceedings against Black for the three child murders and the attempted abduction of Thornhill, the dossier they had assembled was estimated to weigh 22 tonnes. The total cost of the inquiry is estimated to be ¬£12 million.Mapping Murder: The Secrets of Geographical Profiling p. 271 Robert Black appealed against his 1994 convictions. His appeal was heard before Lord Taylor at the Court of Appeal on 20 February 1995. Black contended he had been denied a fair trial due to details of his 1990 abduction and sexual assault charges being introduced as similar fact evidence at his trial, a ruling his defence counsel had fundamentally objected to. Black also contended that the final instructions delivered to the jury by Judge Macpherson had been unbalanced. Black's appeal hearing had been expected to last three days, but at the end of the first day, Lord Taylor refused leave to appeal the conviction on the grounds that Black's trial had been fair, and that none of his contentions could be substantiated. In July 1995, Black was attacked in his cell at Wakefield prison by two fellow inmates, who threw boiling water mixed with sugar over him, bludgeoned him with a table leg, then stabbed him in the back and neck with an improvised knife. Black sustained superficial wounds, burns and bruising in this attack; his attackers were jailed for three further years after admitting wounding Black with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Black never admitted culpability in any of the murders of which he was convicted or suspected, and refused to cooperate with investigators, in spite of having little hope of ever being freed. According to Ray Wyre, a pioneer in the treatment of sex offenders who conducted several interviews with Black between 1990 and 1993, the prime reason for this was an issue of control for Black. Wyre summarised the psychology behind Black's refusal to cooperate with investigators: > He's the sort of person for whom it's all about power and control. Having > information about what he's done gives him power. He has no desire to ease > his conscience, and he's not going to give up the one thing that gives him > power over the pain that his victims' families are suffering. The closest Black ever came to confessing to any of his crimes was shortly before his 1994 trial, when Wyre asked why he had never denied any of the charges brought against him. According to Wyre, Black replied, \\"Because I couldn't.\\" Death Black died from a heart attack in HMP Maghaberry on 12 January 2016. His body was cremated at Roselawn Crematorium, outside Belfast, on 29 January. No family or friends were present at this service. In this short service, the Presbyterian chaplain of HMP Maghaberry, the Reverend Rodney Cameron, read a section of Psalm 90. Black's ashes were scattered at sea in February 2016. Suspected victims Police believe that Black had committed more murders than the four for which he was convicted, with senior detectives believing the true number of victims he had killed to be at least eight. In July 1994, a meeting was convened between senior detectives from the six police forces involved in the nationwide manhunt for Black, and representatives from other UK forces with unsolved missing child and child murder cases. The meeting assessed the evidence investigators had assembled to establish whether Black had killed other children. In 2008, the Crown Prosecution Service stated that insufficient evidence existed to charge Black with any further murders. Black has been linked to 14 further child murders and disappearances across the UK, Ireland, and continental Europe committed between 1969 and 1989. United Kingdom 8 April 1969: April Fabb (13). Fabb was last seen cycling from Metton, Norfolk towards her sister's home in Roughton, Norfolk. Her bicycle was found in a field on the route she had taken, but her body has never been found. 21 May 1973: Christine Markham (9). A Scunthorpe schoolgirl last seen walking to school. Her body has never been found. Black was questioned about potential involvement in her abduction in 2004. Genette Tate. Black was facing formal charges pertaining to Tate's abduction and murder at the time of his death 19 August 1978: Genette Tate (13). Abducted while delivering newspapers in Aylesbeare, Devon. Her bicycle was found in a country lane by two girls she had spoken to minutes before, but her body has never been found. Black made numerous deliveries of posters to the south-west of England in 1978. At the time of Black's death, the Devon and Cornwall Police were due to submit a fresh file to the Crown Prosecution Service, seeking formal abduction and murder charges in relation to this case. 28 July 1979: Suzanne Lawrence (14). Lawrence was last seen leaving her sister's home in Harold Hill, northeast London. Although her body has never been found, Lawrence's name was added to a list of Black's possible victims in July 1994. Her case has also been linked to Peter Tobin 16 June 1980: Patricia Morris (14). Disappeared from the grounds of her comprehensive school; her fully clothed body was found in Hounslow Heath two days after her disappearance. She had been strangled with a ligature, but had not been raped. Although Levi Bellfield has claimed to have murdered Morris, he was barely 12 years old at the time of her death, and police doubt he is the perpetrator. 4 November 1981: Pamela Hastie (16). Her bludgeoned and strangled body was found in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, in November 1981. One eyewitness was adamant he had seen a man matching Black's description running from the crime scene, but police do not believe Black was near Renfrewshire at the time of Hastie's murder. Ireland 18 March 1977: Mary Boyle (6). A Kincasslagh schoolgirl who disappeared while visiting her grandparents in Ballyshannon. Black is known to have been in County Donegal at the time of Boyle's disappearance, being charged with after-hours drinking in Annagry. One eyewitness report states she heard whimpering sounds emanating from his van, parked outiside a Dungloe pub, on this date. Boyle's body has never been found. Germany 20 June 1985: Silke Garben (10). Garben was a Detmold schoolgirl who disappeared on her way to a dental appointment. Her body was found in a stream close to a British Army base near to her home the day after her disappearance. Garben had been violently sexually assaulted and strangled, although she died of drowning.The Murder of Childhood: Inside the Mind of One of Britain‚Äôs Most Notorious Child Murderers p. 234 Black is known to have made a delivery of posters to this British Army base on the date of Garben's disappearance. 11 May 1989. Ramona Herling (11). Last seen walking to a swimming complex just 500 yards from her home in the town of Bad Driburg. Her body has never been found.The Face of Evil: the True Story of the Serial Killer Robert Black ch. 17 Netherlands 5 August 1986: Cheryl Morri√´n (7). Morri√´n disappeared as she walked to her friend's home in the Dutch city of IJmuiden. Her body has never been found. Black made regular trips to nearby Amsterdam to buy child pornography. He is considered a strong suspect in this case. France 5 May 1987: Virginie Delmas (10). Abducted from Neuilly-sur-Marne on 5 May 1987. Her nude body was found in a Paris orchard on 9 October. Delmas had been strangled; the extent of decomposition prevented the pathologist determining whether she had been raped before death. Black made several deliveries in and around Paris on the date of Delmas' disappearance. 30 May 1987: Hemma Greedharry (10). Discovered in the Paris suburb of Malakoff two hours after she was last seen alive. She had been raped and strangled. Black is known to have regularly travelled upon the road where Greedharry's body was found when making deliveries in northern France. 3 June 1987: Perrine Vigneron (7). Vigneron disappeared on her way to buy a Mother's Day card in Bouleurs en route to attending a pottery course; her strangled body was discovered in a rapeseed field in Chelles on 27 June. A white van had been seen in Bouleurs on the day of Vigneron's disappearance. 27 June 1987: Sabine Dumont (9). A Paris schoolgirl last seen alive in Bi√®vres on 27 June. Her strangled and sexually assaulted body was found the following day in the commune of Vauhallan. Black was named as a prime suspect in Dumont's murder in 2011.True Detective April 2016 p. 15 Television Several television programmes have been made about Black. * Scottish Television broadcast a 25-minute documentary relating to Black's crimes on the date of his 1994 murder convictions.

Opened in 1990, it has struggled with high vacancy rates throughout its existence. Its largest retailer is JCPenney, the only traditional anchor store left. It also features a charter school and a trampoline park that both opened in 2018, and a health club that opened in 2019. The mall opened with four large retail anchor stores, a food court with a mosaic, and room for about 62 storefronts, depending on layout. History The 480,000-square-foot mall opened August 1, 1990, with Sears, JCPenney, Sage-Allen and Steinbach as its anchors. It was built by Homart Development Company. Steinbach closed its store by 1999 as part of the company's bankruptcy. Sage-Allen became The Bon-Ton in 1999,http://retailtrafficmag.com/mag/retail_new_england_region/ with a second Bon-Ton and Circuit City splitting the former Steinbach. Circuit City closed in 2009. In 2011, General Growth Properties, the successor company to Homart, transferred ownership of the mall, along with 29 other underperforming malls, to its Rouse Properties subsidiary. In August 2014, Rouse Properties announced that it had defaulted on its loan for Steeplegate Mall and was in the process of turning over the property to its lenders. By April 2015 the property was owned by a consortium of lenders including Wells Fargo Bank and Midland Loan Servicing. The mall is currently managed by Colliers International.Steeplegate Mall transfer is now official Megan Doyle, Concord Monitor, April 7, 2015 In January 2015, Old Navy, one of four main anchors at the mall, closed its doors. In May 2016, Steeplegate Mall was bought by the New York-based Namdar Realty Group for $10.4 million. As part of an attempt to diversify from traditional retail and food stores, Hatbox Theater, a live theater venue located in the former Coldwater Creek, opened in 2016. Similarly, VIP Bounce Houses and Laser Tag opened in the former Old Navy location that year. In April 2018, Bon-Ton closed both of its stores as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. Later that same year, a charter school called Capital City Charter School moved into the former Bon-Ton men's clothing and houseware store and opened on September 5, while an Altitude Trampoline Park franchise opened within the former Circuit City space in November. In 2019, a health club called The Zoo opened a franchise in the former Bon-Ton women's and children's store, marking the first time since Circuit City's closure that all five anchors in the mall had an active permanent tenant. In 2019, one of the mall's oldest tenants, a confectionery called True Confections Candies & Gifts, moved out of the mall, citing declining foot traffic and the mall owners' unwillingness to lower rent rates. On February 6, 2020, Sears closed the Steeplegate store as part of closing 96 stores nationwide.

Externally the most noticeable development was the cab, which was considerably enlarged. Unlike the Matador only 6-wheel versions were produced. 4-wheel versions are extant, but they are probably conversions and one is a Matador with a Mk1 Militant cab. Other changes included the fitting of a larger, 11.3-litre 6-cylinder, diesel engine and the use of a steel frame for the cab, rather than the ash (fraxinus) wood frame of the Matador. The Militant Mark 1 was produced in 6x4 (6 wheels, 4 driven) and 6x6 form (6 wheels, 6 driven). Variants Although primarily intended as a replacement for the Matador artillery tractor, other variants included an articulated lorry tractor unit, a General Service or cargo lorry with a longer wheelbase and as a chassis for mounting various cranes, usually supplied by Coles. Service and Civilian Life The Militant served with the British Army and some other armies in most parts of the world. It was intended as an improved artillery tractor, but after the Second World War, the development of large artillery pieces was gradually dropped in favour of more effective rockets and missiles, making this role largely redundant during the Militant's service life. Crews had mixed views of the Militant. Because it had no power steering, it took considerable effort to turn the steering wheel at slow speeds and in difficult conditions. However, it was credited with a good cross-country performance and was often used to recover the six-wheel drive Alvis Stalwart amphibious lorries that bogged in difficult conditions. (The MkIII did have a power assist Steering Ram). Most variants were fitted with a chassis-mounted winch that was driven through the gearbox. This winch, which was intended for manoeuvering of the towed field gun and for self-recovery of the vehicle, proved extremely strong and reliable. The Militant gained the nickname 'Knocker' from its military crews which may have been due to the rhythmic sound of the slow-revving engines. The Knocker was the nickname of the MkI and the one MkI CALM was still in service with each RCT Transport Squadron until the AEC fleet was replaced by the Bedford 14 Tonne 6X6 in the early 90s. AEC MkIII Recovery Trucks were replaced by Foden GS Recovery 6X6. Many Militants were sold off by the Army in the 1970s and were purchased as heavy recovery vehicles or for forestry use by civilian operators. They were not as popular for forestry operations as their predecessor the Matador because the extra length and an extra axle made them less manoeuvrable in confined spaces. However, some users simply shortened the chassis and removed one axle, effectively creating a more powerful version of the Matador. AEC MK1 Militants were still in service as late as 1985; the MK3s were still in service as late as 1990.

The advances in signals intelligence such as High- frequency direction finding, in cryptological intelligence such as Ultra, and in detection technologies such as radar and sonar/ASDIC enabled the Allied navies to form flotillas designed actively to hunt down submarines and sink them. Similar groups also existed during the Cold War. A hunter-killer group would typically be formed around an escort carrier to provide aerial reconnaissance and air cover, with a number of corvettes, destroyers, destroyer escorts, frigates, and/or United States Coast Guard Cutters armed with depth charges and Hedgehog anti-submarine mortars. Origins The concept was proposed in 1942 for the Royal Navy to organize groups of warships to reinforce the Escort Group accompanying a trans-Atlantic convoy. The Allied Atlantic Convoy Conference of early 1943 agreed to set up ten groups of anti- submarine warships with an escort carrier in each. Five Anglo-Canadian groups would cover the North Atlantic convoy routes and five US groups would cover the Middle Atlantic UG convoys. As increasing numbers of suitable ships became available to screen trade convoys, the faster ships were to be formed into mobile support groups which could provide rapid and heavy reinforcement of threatened convoys. These support group ships could focus on holding down and destroying submarines if freed of responsibility for returning to convoy screening stations. In early March, 1943, each Western Approaches escort group was to be reduced in strength by one frigate, sloop, or destroyer to form four support groups; and a half-flotilla of Home Fleet destroyers would form a fifth support group. Combat experience In early April 1943 the 2nd Support Group of s began operating along the Gibraltar convoy routes while sloops and s of the 1st Support Group and O and P-class destroyers of the 3rd Support Group began responding to HX, SC, and ON convoys coming under attack. The first support groups with escort carriers were the fourth and fifth support groups of destroyers formed around and in late April. The first United States Navy support group was formed around with several Wickes and s. About six ships were assigned to each support group, but damage and mechanical defects limited operational availability so only three or four ships from a group responded to most missions. The slower speed of 1st and 2nd Support Group ships limited their ability to travel with the other groups, but E and F-class, I-class, L and M-class, and O and P-class destroyers moved between the 3rd, 4th and 5th Support Groups from one mission to the next. Support groups without escort carriers were assisted by VLR patrol bombers. These early support groups made a significant contribution to the turning point battles known as Black May (1943). Many more support groups were created as production of anti-submarine warships and escort carriers exceeded the number required for screening convoys. These groups were able to shift Allied focus from defensive support of convoy screens to offensive operations hunting and destroying enemy submarines. Cold War preparations As Cold War tensions increased, the United States Navy formed modernized hunter-killer groups in anticipation of potential use of Soviet submarines to intercept North American shipping to European NATO allies. As modern anti-submarine aircraft became too large to operate from escort carriers, s were reclassified as anti-submarine warfare carriers (CVS). Some second world war destroyers were reclassified as escort destroyers (DDE) with guns and torpedoes replaced by RUR-4 Weapon Alpha or hedgehog. Operational doctrine anticipated each CVS would be accompanied by eight DDEs. Four DDEs would provide a close screen for the CVS while the other four attacked submarines detected by aircraft. The cost of Vietnam War combat operations prevented replacement of these ASW ships when they reached the end of their design life. Newly operational SOSUS and shore-based Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft assumed the mid-ocean ASW search and attack role of the disappearing CVS hunter-killer groups.

Several woman print sellers ran successful businesses in 18th-century London‚Äîfor example, Mary Darly, Susan Vivares, and Elizabeth Jackson. Humphrey was preeminent among them and became one of the top two print sellers in London, the other one being Samuel Fores. Her shop in St James was visited by a fashionable clientele and had a large stock of social and political caricature, including caricature portraits of leading society figures. Notable artists she published beside Gillray included Thomas Rowlandson and James Sayers. She moved premises a number of times: from 18 Old Bond Street (1778‚Äì83) to 51 New Bond Street (1783‚Äì89), to 18 Old Bond Street (1790‚Äì94), to 37 New Bond Street (1794‚Äì97) and finally settling in 27 St James's Street (1797‚Äì1817), depicted in the print Very Slippy-Weather. James Gillray lodged with her for much of his working life, and she looked after him after his lapse into insanity around 1810 until his death in 1815. In Two-Penny Whist,BM Satires 8885 the character shown second from the left, an ageing lady with eyeglasses and a bonnet, is widely believed to be a depiction of Humphrey.

The \\"Walk\\" itself, consisting of two rows of eight buildings facing each other across a narrow courtyard, runs through the middle of the block between 94th and 95th, with a locked gate at each end. Each building originally had one apartment on each floor. In recent years, some buildings have been reconfigured to serve as single-family homes. Pomander Walk is different in style and out of scale with the tall buildings that surround it. Author and former resident Darryl Pinckney called it \\"an insertion of incredible whimsy\\" into the Upper West Side. It is not open to the public and visit is by invitation only. History Postcard for the 1910 Broadway production of Pomander Walk Pomander Walk in 2009 Pomander Walk in the early 1920s, when it was first built. The complex is named for Pomander Walk, a romantic comedy by Louis N. Parker which opened in New York in 1910. The play is set on an imaginary byway near London. The place as built bears a tenuous resemblance to the setting described in the play as \\"a retired crescent of five very small, old-fashioned houses near Chiswick, on the river-bank. ... They are exactly alike: miniature copies of Queen Anne mansions\\". New York City's Pomander Walk is Tudoresque, a style that enjoyed a vogue in America in the years following World War I. The Walk is not a mews, though often so- called, having no history as a stables. The buildings may fairly be described as Storybook Houses, an architectural trend of the 1920s in England and the United States. Pomander Walk was built in 1921 by nightclub impresario Thomas J. Healy who planned to build a major hotel on the site. According to city historian Christopher Gray, when Healy was unable to get financing for a hotel, he built the houses that stand on the site today, apparently to provide a temporary cash-flow while he waited to raze them and build the hotel. It was designed by the New York architecture firm King and Campbell. Healy died in 1927, however, so Pomander Walk remained. By the 1970s, the complex was rundown and at risk of being demolished. However, it was saved with a City, State, and National Historic Landmark designation in 1982 Includes designation report (City) and notification letter (State and National). after tenants banded together to block redevelopment. An earlier application for City Landmark status had been rejected in 1966. In 2009 the owners completed a four-year facade renovation, restoring architectural details that had been lost for decades.

This is the Gambia River in Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National Park. Climate change has adversely affected both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Future climate change is expected to further affect many ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves, coral reefs,IPCC, Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers, Section 3: Projected climate change and its impacts, in and caves. General Global warming is likely to affect terrestrial ecoregions. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems will change; some species are being forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions, while others are flourishing. Other effects of global warming include lessened snow cover, rising sea levels, and weather changes, may influence human activities and the ecosystem. Within the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, experts assessed the literature on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. Rosenzweig et al. (2007) concluded that over the last three decades, human-induced warming had likely had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems (p. 81). Schneider et al. (2007) concluded, with very high confidence, that regional temperature trends had already affected species and ecosystems around the world (p. 792). They also concluded that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of ecosystems (p. 792). * Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity: With a warming of 3 ¬∞C, relative to 1990 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider et al., 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider et al. (2007:788) concluded that a global mean temperature increase of around 4 ¬∞C (above the 1990-2000 level) by 2100 would lead to major extinctions around the globe. * Marine ecosystems and biodiversity: With very high confidence, Schneider et al. (2007:792) concluded that a warming of 2 ¬∞C above 1990 levels would result in mass mortality of coral reefs globally. In addition, several studies dealing with planktonic organisms and modelling have shown that temperature plays a transcendental role in marine microbial food webs, which may have a deep influence on the biological carbon pump of marine planktonic pelagic and mesopelagic ecosystems. * Freshwater ecosystems: Above about a 4 ¬∞C increase in global mean temperature by 2100 (relative to 1990-2000), Schneider et al. (2007:789) concluded, with high confidence, that many freshwater species would become extinct. Impacts= Biodiversity  Extinction = Studying the association between Earth climate and extinctions over the past 520 million years, scientists from the University of York write, \\"The global temperatures predicted for the coming centuries may trigger a new ‚Äòmass extinction event‚Äô, where over 50 percent of animal and plant species would be wiped out.\\" Many of the species at risk are Arctic and Antarctic fauna such as polar bears and emperor penguins. In the Arctic, the waters of Hudson Bay are ice-free for three weeks longer than they were thirty years ago, affecting polar bears, which prefer to hunt on sea ice.On Thinning Ice Michael Byers London Review of Books January 2005 Species that rely on cold weather conditions such as gyrfalcons, and snowy owls that prey on lemmings that use the cold winter to their advantage may be negatively affected. Marine invertebrates achieve peak growth at the temperatures they have adapted to, and cold-blooded animals found at high latitudes and altitudes generally grow faster to compensate for the short growing season. Warmer-than-ideal conditions result in higher metabolism and consequent reductions in body size despite increased foraging, which in turn elevates the risk of predation. Indeed, even a slight increase in temperature during development impairs growth efficiency and survival rate in rainbow trout. Mechanistic studies have documented extinctions due to recent climate change: McLaughlin et al. documented two populations of Bay checkerspot butterfly being threatened by precipitation change. Parmesan states, \\"Few studies have been conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species\\" and McLaughlin et al. agreed \\"few mechanistic studies have linked extinctions to recent climate change.\\" Daniel Botkin and other authors in one study believe that projected rates of extinction are overestimated. For \\"recent\\" extinctions, see Holocene extinction. Many species of freshwater and saltwater plants and animals are dependent on glacier-fed waters to ensure a cold water habitat that they have adapted to. Some species of freshwater fish need cold water to survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with salmon and cutthroat trout. Reduced glacier runoff can lead to insufficient stream flow to allow these species to thrive. Ocean krill, a cornerstone species, prefer cold water and are the primary food source for aquatic mammals such as the blue whale. Alterations to the ocean currents, due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to thermohaline circulation of the worlds oceans, may affect existing fisheries upon which humans depend as well. The white lemuroid possum, only found in the Daintree mountain forests of northern Queensland, may be the first mammal species to be driven extinct by global warming in Australia. In 2008, the white possum has not been seen in over three years. The possums cannot survive extended temperatures over , which occurred in 2005. A 27-year study of the largest colony of Magellanic penguins in the world, published in 2014, found that extreme weather caused by climate change is responsible for killing 7% of penguin chicks per year on average, and in some years studied climate change accounted for up to 50% of all chick deaths. Since 1987, the number of breeding pairs in the colony has reduced by 24%. = Behaviour change = Rising temperatures are beginning to have a noticeable impact on birds, and butterflies have shifted their ranges northward by 200 km in Europe and North America. The migration range of larger animals may be constrained by human development.need citation In Britain, spring butterflies are appearing an average of 6 days earlier than two decades ago. A 2002 article in Nature surveyed the scientific literature to find recent changes in range or seasonal behaviour by plant and animal species. Of species showing recent change, 4 out of 5 shifted their ranges towards the poles or higher altitudes, creating \\"refugee species\\". Frogs were breeding, flowers blossoming and birds migrating an average 2.3 days earlier each decade; butterflies, birds and plants moving towards the poles by 6.1 km per decade. A 2005 study concludes human activity is the cause of the temperature rise and resultant changing species behaviour, and links these effects with the predictions of climate models to provide validation for them. Scientists have observed that Antarctic hair grass is colonizing areas of Antarctica where previously their survival range was limited.Grass flourishes in warmer Antarctic originally from The Times, December 2004 Climate change is leading to a mismatch between the snow camouflage of arctic animals such as snowshoe hares with the increasingly snow-free landscape. = Invasive species Forests Change in Photosynthetic Activity in Northern Forests 1982‚Äì2003; NASA Earth Observatory Pine forests in British Columbia have been devastated by a pine beetle infestation, which has expanded unhindered since 1998 at least in part due to the lack of severe winters since that time; a few days of extreme cold kill most mountain pine beetles and have kept outbreaks in the past naturally contained. The infestation, which (by November 2008) has killed about half of the province's lodgepole pines (33 million acres or 135,000 km¬≤) is an order of magnitude larger than any previously recorded outbreak. One reason for unprecedented host tree mortality may be due to that the mountain pine beetles have higher reproductive success in lodgepole pine trees growing in areas where the trees have not experienced frequent beetle epidemics, which includes much of the current outbreak area. In 2007 the outbreak spread, via unusually strong winds, over the continental divide to Alberta. An epidemic also started, be it at a lower rate, in 1999 in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. The United States forest service predicts that between 2011 and 2013 virtually all of Colorado's lodgepole pine trees over five inches (127 mm) in diameter will be lost. As the northern forests are a carbon sink, while dead forests are a major carbon source, the loss of such large areas of forest has a positive feedback on global warming. In the worst years, the carbon emission due to beetle infestation of forests in British Columbia alone approaches that of an average year of forest fires in all of Canada or five years worth of emissions from that country's transportation sources. = Wildfires = Besides the immediate ecological and economic impact, the huge dead forests provide a fire risk. Even many healthy forests appear to face an increased risk of forest fires because of warming climates. The 10-year average of boreal forest burned in North America, after several decades of around 10,000 km¬≤ (2.5 million acres), has increased steadily since 1970 to more than 28,000 km¬≤ (7 million acres) annually.US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change Regional Paper: Alaska Though this change may be due in part to changes in forest management practices, in the western U.S., since 1986, longer, warmer summers have resulted in a fourfold increase of major wildfires and a sixfold increase in the area of forest burned, compared to the period from 1970 to 1986. A similar increase in wildfire activity has been reported in Canada from 1920 to 1999. Forest fires in Indonesia have dramatically increased since 1997 as well. These fires are often actively started to clear forest for agriculture. They can set fire to the large peat bogs in the region and the CO‚ÇÇreleased by these peat bog fires has been estimated, in an average year, to be 15% of the quantity of CO‚ÇÇproduced by fossil fuel combustion.BBC News: Asian peat fires add to warming A 2018 study found that trees grow faster due to increased carbon dioxide levels, however, the trees are also eight to twelve percent lighter and denser since 1900. The authors note, \\"Even though a greater volume of wood is being produced today, it now contains less material than just a few decades ago.\\" In 2019 unusually hot and dry weather in parts of the northern hemisphere caused massive wildfires, from the Mediterranean to ‚Äì in particular ‚Äì the Arctic. Climate change, by rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging their season. The northern part of the world is warming faster than the planet on average. The average June temperature in the parts of Siberia, where wildfires are raging, was almost ten degrees higher than the 1981‚Äì2010 average. Temperatures in Alaska reach record highs of up to 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C) on 4 July, fuelling fires in the state, including along the Arctic Circle. In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires cause air pollution, that can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in far away regions. Wildfires also release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. For example, the 2014 megafires in Canada burned more than 7 million acres of forest, releasing more than 103 million tonnes of carbon ‚Äì half as much as all the plants in Canada typically absorb in an entire year. Wildfires are common in the northern hemisphere between May and October, but the latitude, intensity, and the length of the fires, were particularly unusual. In June 2019, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) has tracked over 100 intense and long-lived wildfires in the Arctic. In June alone, they emitted 50 megatones of carbon dioxide - equivalent to Sweden's annual GHG emissions. This is more than was released by Arctic fires in the same month in the years 2010 - 2018 combined. The fires have been most severe in Alaska and Siberia, where some cover territory equal to almost 100 000 football pitches. In Alberta, one fire was bigger than 300 000 pitches. In Alaska alone, CAMS has registered almost 400 wildfires this year, with new ones igniting every day. In Canada, smoke from massive wildfires near Ontario are producing large amounts of air pollution. The heat wave in Europe also caused wildfires in a number of countries, including Germany, Greece and Spain. The heat is drying forests and making them more susceptible to wildfires. Boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years. The Arctic region, is particularly sensitive and warming faster than most other regions. Particles of smoke can land on snow and ice, causing them to absorb sunlight that it would otherwise reflect, accelerating the warming. Fires in the Arctic also increase the risk of permafrost thawing that releases methane - strong greenhouse gas. Improving forecasting systems is important to solve the problem. In view of the risks, WMO has created a Vegetation Fire and Smoke Pollution Warning and Advisory System for forecasting fires and related impacts and hazards across the globe. WMO's Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a short video about the issue. Mountains Mountains cover approximately 25 percent of earth's surface and provide a home to more than one-tenth of global human population. Changes in global climate pose a number of potential risks to mountain habitats. Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of forest fires, the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of fresh water. Studies suggest a warmer climate in the United States would cause lower-elevation habitats to expand into the higher alpine zone.The Potential Effects Of Global Climate Change On The United States Report to Congress Editors: Joel B. Smith and Dennis Tirpak US-EPA December 1989 Such a shift would encroach on the rare alpine meadows and other high-altitude habitats. High-elevation plants and animals have limited space available for new habitat as they move higher on the mountains in order to adapt to long-term changes in regional climate. Changes in climate will also affect the depth of the mountains snowpacks and glaciers. Any changes in their seasonal melting can have powerful impacts on areas that rely on freshwater runoff from mountains. Rising temperature may cause snow to melt earlier and faster in the spring and shift the timing and distribution of runoff. These changes could affect the availability of freshwater for natural systems and human uses. OceansOcean acidification= Estimated annual mean sea surface anthropogenic dissolved inorganic carbon concentration for the present day (normalised to year 2002) from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project v2 (GLODAPv2) climatology. dissolved oxygen from the World Ocean Atlas 2009. Dissolved oxygen here is in mol O2m‚àí3. Ocean acidification poses a severe threat to the earth's natural process of regulating atmospheric C02 levels, causing a decrease in water's ability to dissolve oxygen and created oxygen-vacant bodies of water called \\"dead zones.\\" The ocean absorbs up to 55% of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lessoning the effects of climate change. This diffusion of carbon dioxide into seawater results in three acidic molecules: bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), aqueous carbon dioxide (CO2aq), and carbonic acid (H2CO3). These three compounds increase the ocean's acidity, decreasing its ph by up to 0.1 per 100ppm (part per million) of atmospheric CO2. The increase of ocean acidity also decelerates the rate of calcification in salt water, leading to slower growing reefs which support a whopping 25% of marine life. As seen with the great barrier reef, the increase in ocean acidity in not only killing the coral, but also the wildly diverse population of marine inhabitants which coral reefs support. =Dissolved oxygen= Another issue faced by increasing global temperatures is the decrease of the ocean's ability to dissolve oxygen, one with potentially more severe consequences than other repercussions of global warming. Ocean depths between 100 meters and 1,000 meters are known as \\"oceanic mid zones\\" and host a plethora of biologically diverse species, one of which being zooplankton. Zooplankton feed on smaller organisms such as phytoplankton, which are an integral part of the marine food web. Phytoplankton perform photosynthesis, receiving energy from light, and provide sustenance and energy for the larger zooplankton, which provide sustenance and energy for the even larger fish, and so on up the food chain. The increase in oceanic temperatures lowers the ocean's ability to retain oxygen generated from phytoplankton, and therefore reduces the amount of bioavailable oxygen that fish and other various marine wildlife rely on for their survival. This creates marine dead zones, and the phenomenon has already generated multiple marine dead zones around the world, as marine currents effectively \\"trap\\" the deoxygenated water. =Algal bloom= Climate change can increase the frequency and the magnitude of algal bloom. In 2019 the biggest Sargassum bloom ever seen created a crisis in the Tourism industry in North America. The event was probably caused by Climate Change and Fertilizers. Several Caribbean countries, even considered declaring a state of emergency due to the impact on tourism. The bloom can benefit the marine life, but, can also block the sunlight necessary for it. = Impact on phytoplankton = Satellite measurement and chlorophyll observations show decline in the number of phytoplankton, microorganisms that produce half of the earth's oxygen, absorb half of the world carbon dioxide and serve foundation of the entire marine food chain. The decline is probably linked to climate change. However, there are some measurements that show increases in the number of phytoplankton. = Coral bleaching = The warming of water lead to bleaching of the corals what can cause serious damage to them. In the Great Barrier Reef, before 1998 there were not such events. The first event happened in 1998 and after it they begun to occur more and more frequently so in the years 2016 - 2020 there were 3 of them. =Combined impact= Eventually the planet will warm to such a degree that the ocean's ability to dissolve oxygen will no longer exist, resulting in a worldwide dead zone. Dead zones, in combination with ocean acidification, will usher in an era where marine life in most forms will cease to exist, causing a sharp decline in the amount of oxygen generated through bio carbon sequestration, perpetuating the cycle. This disruption to the food chain will cascade upward, thinning out populations of primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, etc., as primary consumers being the initial victims of these phenomenon. = Marine wildlife Fresh waterDisruption to water cycle= The water cycle Fresh water covers only 0.8% of the Earth's surface, but contains up to 6% of all life on the planet. However, the impacts climate change deal to its ecosystems are often overlooked. Very few studies showcase the potential results of climate change on large-scale ecosystems which are reliant on freshwater, such as river ecosystems, lake ecosystems, desert ecosystems, etc. However, a comprehensive study published in 2009 delves into the effects to be felt by lotic (flowing) and lentic (still) freshwater ecosystems in the American Northeast. According to the study, persistent rainfall, typically felt year round, will begin to diminish and rates of evaporation will increase, resulting in drier summers and more sporadic periods of precipitation throughout the year. Additionally, a decrease in snowfall is expected, which leads to less runoff in the spring when snow thaws and enters the watershed, resulting in lower-flowing fresh water rivers. This decrease in snowfall also leads to increased runoff during winter months, as rainfall cannot permeate the frozen ground usually covered by water-absorbing snow. These effects on the water cycle will wreak havoc for indigenous species residing in fresh water lakes and streams. =Salt water contamination and cool water species= Eagle River in central Alaska, home to various indigenous freshwater species. Species of fish living in cold or cool water can see a reduction in population of up to 50% in the majority of U.S. fresh water streams, according to most climate change models. The increase in metabolic demands due to higher water temperatures, in combination with decreasing amounts of food will be the main contributors to their decline. Additionally, many fish species (such as salmon) utilize seasonal water levels of streams as a means of reproducing, typically breeding when water flow is high and migrating to the ocean after spawning. Because snowfall is expected to be reduced due to climate change, water runoff is expected to decrease which leads to lower flowing streams, effecting the spawning of millions of salmon. To add to this, rising seas will begin to flood coastal river systems, converting them from fresh water habitats to saline environments where indigenous species will likely perish. In southeast Alaska, the sea rises by 3.96 cm/year, redepositing sediment in various river channels and bringing salt water inland. This rise in sea level not only contaminates streams and rivers with saline water, but also the reservoirs they are connected to, where species such as Sockeye Salmon live. Although this species of Salmon can survive in both salt and fresh water, the loss of a body of fresh water stops them from reproducing in the spring, as the spawning process requires fresh water. Undoubtedly, the loss of fresh water systems of lakes and rivers in Alaska will result in the imminent demise of the state's once-abundant population of salmon. =Combined impact= In general, as the planet warms, the amount of fresh water bodies across the planet decreases, as evaporation rates increase, rain patterns become more sporadic, and watershed patterns become fragmented, resulting in less cyclical water flow in river and stream systems. This disruption to fresh water cycles disrupts the feeding, mating, and migration patterns of organisms reliant on fresh water ecosystems. Additionally, the encroachment of saline water into fresh water river systems endangers indigenous species which can only survive in fresh water. Ecological productivity * According to a paper by Smith and Hitz (2003:66), it is reasonable to assume that the relationship between increased global mean temperature and ecosystem productivity is parabolic. Higher carbon dioxide concentrations will favourably affect plant growth and demand for water. Higher temperatures could initially be favourable for plant growth. Eventually, increased growth would peak then decline. * According to IPCC (2007:11), a global average temperature increase exceeding 1.5‚Äì2.5 ¬∞C (relative to the period 1980‚Äì99), would likely have a predominantly negative impact on ecosystem goods and services, e.g., water and food supply. * Research done by the Swiss Canopy Crane Project suggests that slow-growing trees only are stimulated in growth for a short period under higher CO2 levels, while faster growing plants like liana benefit in the long term. In general, but especially in rainforests, this means that liana become the prevalent species; and because they decompose much faster than trees their carbon content is more quickly returned to the atmosphere. Slow growing trees incorporate atmospheric carbon for decades. Species migration In 2010, a gray whale was found in the Mediterranean Sea, even though the species had not been seen in the North Atlantic Ocean since the 18th century. The whale is thought to have migrated from the Pacific Ocean via the Arctic. Climate Change & European Marine Ecosystem Research (CLAMER) has also reported that the Neodenticula seminae alga has been found in the North Atlantic, where it had gone extinct nearly 800,000 years ago. The alga has drifted from the Pacific Ocean through the Arctic, following the reduction in polar ice. In the Siberian subarctic, species migration is contributing to another warming albedo-feedback, as needle-shedding larch trees are being replaced with dark- foliage evergreen conifers which can absorb some of the solar radiation that previously reflected off the snowpack beneath the forest canopy. It has been projected many fish species will migrate towards the North and South poles as a result of climate change, and that many species of fish near the Equator will go extinct as a result of global warming. Migratory birds are especially at risk for endangerment due to the extreme dependability on temperature and air pressure for migration, foraging, growth, and reproduction. Much research has been done on the effects of climate change on birds, both for future predictions and for conservation. The species said to be most at risk for endangerment or extinction are populations that are not of conservation concern. It is predicted that a 3.5 degree increase in surface temperature will occur by year 2100, which could result in between 600 and 900 extinctions, which mainly will occur in the tropical environments.  Species adaptation  In November 2019 it was revealed that a 45-year study indicated that climate change had affected the gene pool of the red deer population on R√πm, one of the Inner Hebrides islands, Scotland. Warmer temperatures resulted in deer giving birth on average three days earlier for each decade of the study. The gene which selects for earlier birth has increased in the population because does with the gene have more calves over their lifetime. Dr Timoth√©e Bonnet, of the Australian National University, leader of the study, said they had \\"documented evolution in action\\". In December 2019 the results of a joint study by Chicago's Field Museum and the University of Michigan into changes in the morphology of birds was published in Ecology Letters. The study uses bodies of birds which died as a result of colliding with buildings in Chicago, Illinois, since 1978. The sample is made up of over 70,000 specimens from 52 species and span the period from 1978 to 2016. The study shows that the length of birds' lower leg bones (an indicator of body sizes) shortened by an average of 2.4% and their wings lengthened by 1.3%. The findings of the study suggest the morphological changes are the result of climate change, and demonstrate an example of evolutionary change following Bergmann's rule.  Impacts of species degradation due to climate change on livelihoods  The livelihoods of nature dependent communities depend on abundance and availability of certain species. Climate change conditions such as increase in atmospheric temperature and carbon dioxide concentration directly affect availability of biomass energy, food, fiber and other ecosystem services. Degradation of species supplying such products directly affect the livelihoods of people relying on them more so in Africa. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by changes in rainfall variability which is likely to give dominance to invasive species especially those that are spread across large latitudinal gradients. The effects that climate change has on both plant and animal species within certain ecosystems has the ability to directly affect the human inhabitants who rely on natural resources. Frequently, the extinction of plant and animal species create a cyclic relationship of species endangerment in ecosystems which are directly affected by climate change.  Agriculture  Droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas. Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock. Price of corn in North America, in U.S. dollars per bushel, 2004‚Äì2012. Droughts are becoming more frequent and intense in arid and semiarid western North America as temperatures have been rising, advancing the timing and magnitude of spring snow melt floods and reducing river flow volume in summer. Direct effects of climate change include increased heat and water stress, altered crop phenology, and disrupted symbiotic interactions. These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river flow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favor of non-native herbaceous and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects. By 2012, North American corn prices had risen to a record $8.34 per bushel in August, leaving 20 of the 211 U.S. ethanol fuel plants idle.

It is situated at Farashgonj road in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, on the north bank of the Buriganga River.  History  A window ornated using the European style In 1874, Indian Governor Thomas George Baring, Lord Northbrook, the Viceroy of India between 1872 and 1876, came to visit Dhaka. In order to make his visit memorable, Raja Rai Bahadur, along with eminent Zamidars and affluent citizens of Dhaka, donated 10 thousand and 5 thousand taka each to build the Town Hall in 1879. Abhay Chandra Das was the committee secretary. In 1880, the Commissioner of Dhaka inaugurated it and the personal orchestra of Nawab Abdul Ghani was brought to entertain the commissioner and the guests on inauguration. On 8 February 1882, a public library was added on the south-east side of the Hall. It was named the Northbrook Public Library and became known for its literary collection. Many books were ruined during the 1971 Liberation War. To re-establish the library, the Maharaja of Tripura donated 1000 TK, the Zamidar of Baliati Brojendro Kumar Roy 1000 TK, Queen Shornomoi 700 TK, Kalikhrishno 500 TK and Bishaishori Devi donated 500 TK. In 1887, the library opened with 1000 books. A clubhouse was added to the south-side and called Johnson Hall. At Northbrook Hall, Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore was honoured by Dhaka Municipality and the People's Association on 7 February 1926. In 1950, Northbrook Hall was used as a telegram office, and later as the Central Women's College. The building is the property of Dhaka Municipality Corporation.Mamun, M. Dhaka Smriti Bismritir Nagari. Ananya, 1993, pp. 138‚Äì139.Ahmed, Dr.N Discover The Monuments Of Bangladesh. University Press Limited, 1984, p.212 .  Architecture  Windows with columns and small arches Northbrook Hall is an Indo-Saracen building, and a fusion of Mughal architecture and European Renaissance architectural styles. The semi-circular horseshoe arches contain the main entrance on the north side. The four octagonal minarets on the north side, along with pinnacles and ornamental parapet, show the Muslim and Mughal features. The windows, doors and walls were ornate, following the European style, but the domes at the top of the building were ornate following the Muslim style.Ahmed, Dr.N Discover The Monuments Of Bangladesh. University Press Limited, 1984, p. 213.  Current situation  Northbrook Public Library The Buriganga River could be seen from the Northbrook Hall when it was built, but by 1930 the riverfront and the river was obscured. The area lost its importance and residential character and had transformed into a commercial area. In 1998, a government education office was built by the side of Northbrook Hall, part of which is now used by a decorator, and a pentagram fountain in front of the north entrance now completely obscures the view. Northbrook Hall is one of the protected buildings under the Department of Archaeology. Over the years, several phases of restoration work were undertaken by the Department of Archaeology, in coordination with the Dhaka Municipality Corporation. As the bed on the ornamentations and surface painting on most occasions. However, as the building is more than 130 years old, on few instances, comparatively major restoration building has been actively in use for over a century, only minor restorations were required, especially for the condensation of the plasterwork and paint. The restoration works at Northbrook Hall were more convenient for the Department of Archaeology, as the Dhaka Municipality Corporation actively supported the projects; along with the users, the local community. As there has been no disruption in the use of the building for over a century, the original details of the jalli work and surface ornamentations has survived in very good shape. Also, as the building is actively used and in relatively good shape compared to the other vulnerable heritage, no special fund was required for the conservation (as seen in the other examples like Panamnagar). The users of the building took partial responsibility of the minor restoration works under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. Northbrook Hall can be considered one of the more successful formal conservation projects undertaken by the Department of Archaeology. One of the major threats for the heritage building is the encroaching structures, like an assembly hall and a few community canters built surrounding the building. Another critical factor is the 'List of Protected Heritage' published in 2009. Before the list was published, the collaboration between the local community, Dhaka Municipal Corporation and the Department of Archaeology was flexible.IFTEKHAR AHMED, The University of Hong Kong ,p 218-219.

Will III, (October 6, 1956) also known as Hank Will, is an American journalist, writer, and magazine editor. As editor of Grit magazine (and contributing editor of Natural Home and Garden), he writes a blog, The Daily Commute, that covers a wide variety of topics related to rural living. He came up with the idea for Community Chickens, a website that brings together information about raising chickens. It draws its contents from Grit and Mother Earth News magazine. Will is also the author of four books on vintage farm machinery: Cub Cadet: the first 45 Years, PayLine: International Harvester‚Äôs Construction Equipment Division, and the Farmall Regular, F-Series Collector‚Äôs Originality Guide and Garden Tractors: Deere, Cub Cadet, Wheel Horse, and All the Rest, 1930s to Current. Hank also wrote a fifth book Plowing With Pigs with his wife Karen Keb Will. Agricultural-background Will started his career in agriculture while working toward advanced scientific degrees at the University of Chicago. An article in Mother Earth News magazine inspired Will and his wife to grow and sell alfalfa sprouts to individuals, stores and food- buying co-ops in Chicago in the 1970s and early 1980s. Each week, they sold several hundred pounds from their South Side apartment. Will was also a partner in a small food-purchasing and trucking company that served neighborhood co-ops, several coffee shops and restaurants in the Hyde Park area. Will and his family later put their rural Harrisburg, S.D., farm to work with four acres of native perennials, a nursery containing thousands of trees and shrubs, cut flower gardens, berries and rhubarb. The family marketed the bulk of their production through the Downtown Sioux Falls, S.D., Farmers Market. During their final years in South Dakota, Will and his wife co-chaired the enterprise. Will also raised several thousand free-range broilers annually from that South Dakota location, selling them through direct marketing. The family's laying flock supplied thousands of donated eggs year-round to the Banquet, a Sioux Falls feeding ministry, and other local food charities. Another of their poultry projects supplied hundreds of pounds of free-range turkey to the Banquet and Sioux Falls Food Pantry during the holiday season. Will currently pastures Mulefoot hogs and Highland cattle, keeps a flock of chickens and turkeys, and grows a large food garden on his Osage County, Kan., farm. He is an experienced grazier who favors low-stress, intensive management of animals, pastures and hay meadows. He believes in improving soils and the pasture matrix by carefully timing the frequency and duration of animal grazing. He managed a herd of purebred Angus cattle in Ohio, consisting of about 150 head in a year. He was also involved with native prairie restoration projects in Ohio and native prairie management in South Dakota. The Ohio cattle farm was recognized for exemplary herd and forage management and clean water, and it was included on the Heart of Ohio Tour in the late 1990s.

He was born and died in Sassari. Biography The first mention of Giovanni del Giglio might be from 1512, when the monk \\"Johannes de Liliis\\" arrived in Sassari to restore the hospital of Santa Croce.Despite the similarity of the names, it is difficult to be certain that Giovanni and the monk are the same person because: first, de Liliis was a monk, while del Giglio married; and secondly, the monk is never mentioned as a painter. On August 7, 1522, del Giglio witnessed the will of Giovanni Fontana, father of the jurist Alessio Fontana, who ordered that his property be used for the altarpiece of Sassari Cathedral. Del Giglio was the attorney of Archbishop Salvatore Alepus, who commissioned del Giglio's Ploaghe altarpiece. From 1532 to 1543, Giglio was part of the Sassari confraternity. Around 1543, he married Andreuccia Olives, the sister of the jurist Girolamo Olives, and the widow of the tailor Forteleoni de Ginesi. From Olive's previous marriage, he gained a stepdaughter, who was born in 1540. Del Giglio had no other children. This marriage allowed him to convince Girolamo Olives' confidant, the bishop of Alghero, Pedro Vaguer, to give him the commission for the altarpieces of Benetutti and Bortigali between 1549 and 1551. These may have been completed by other painters of his school, possibly Pietro Giovanni Calvano, from Siena. School Other painters of his school were Antonio Campus, Giovanni Debasteriga, and Leonardo de Serra. The Ozieri altarpiece is attributed to his school. Style Del Giglio's style, which had a large influence on painting in Sardinia until the arrival of Baccio Gorini, shows the influence of Raphael and Michelangelo as well as the early Tuscan style of Rosso Fiorentino and Pontormo. His use of color and techniques placed him among the leading Mannerists in Sardenia.

Toledo. 20 a√±os de ayuntamiento democr√°tico (1979-1999). Volumen I. Editorial Azacanes. . P√°g. 418-421 As the capital, it is the seat of the regional parliament, the Cortes of Castilla-La Mancha, located in the Convento de San Gil, and the presidential office, located in the Palacio de Fuensalida. For regional elections Toledo city forms a constituency with the rest of the province. Eleven seats out of the total of 47 members are allocated to the province. In the latest elections, held in 2007, the PSOE won six seats and the PP five. The PSOE has always won in the district of Toledo, although in the municipal elections for Toledo held at the same time as the regional elections of 2007, the victory went to the PP, which obtained 46.38% of the vote. Apart from the PSOE and the PP (formerly AP), the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) has achieved parliamentary representation for Toledo, one seat in 1987. Provincial politics The city is the seat of the Diputaci√≥n Provincial de Toledo. The council is composed of provincial deputies to be mayors or council members. The constituencies are the six judicial districts, thus part of the city of Toledo's namesake judicial district, with 23 other municipalities. Currently, the PSOE has 14 provincial deputies, and the PP 13. In the city's district ten deputies are elected, the last election returned five for the PSOE and five for the PP. Municipal politics Toledo City Hall. The city administration for the City Council is composed of 25 councilors elected by universal suffrage every four years with closed lists. Five parties submitted lists for the most recent election: the People's Party (PP, headed by former mayor Jos√© Manuel Molina), the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE, led by Vice President of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha and current mayor, Emiliano Garc√≠a-Page), the United Left (IU, led by Aurelio San Emeterio), Spanish Democratic Party and earth Commoners. The first three parties won representation: 12 for the PP, eleven for the PSOE and two for the IU. The PSOE and IU made a pact to govern, and the PSOE's Emiliano Garcia-Page became mayor. Political history The first democratic elections in 1979 were won by the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) with 11 seats. The PSOE won 7, the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) 5, and the Democratic Coalition and the New Forces one. A coalition government formed, with Juan Ignacio de Mesa of the UCD as mayor. In the second election, held in 1983, only three parties won representation due to the dissolution of the UCD (PSOE 11, CD 11 and PCE 3), although initially the Popular Democratic Party won two council independently, then formed a group with People's Alliance. The mayoralty passed to the PSOE's Joaqu√≠n S√°nchez Garrido, who ruled in coalition with the PCE. In 1987, People's Alliance (later known as People's Party) won the election with 12 council members, while the PSOE led by Candelas Ricardo Sanchez dropped to 8 councilors. The PCE, which had become the United Left, could not improve their performance, retaining three councilmen. In addition, the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS), had two councillors elected, who made a coalition with the People's Alliance, allowing Jose Manuel Molina Garcia to become mayor. Since 1991, when the CSD disappeared, Toledo's council has never had more than three parties. Those elections were won by the PP, but the PSOE's Garrido Sanchez became mayor in coalition with the United Left. In 1995, the PP, led by Agustin Conde Bajen, became the first party to get the majority of votes and seats. For the elections of 1999, Jos√© Manuel Molina was again the candidate of the PP since Conde was presented to the regional elections. The PSOE was led by Molt√≥ Juan Pedro Hernandez, national deputy for the province. Remarkable about this election is that the PSOE was presented under the name Progressive PSOE-led by the agreement left out of Castilla-La Mancha-Nueva Izquierda, Izquierda Unida division forming part of the two councilors who scored in that game 1995. The elections the PP again won the absolute majority, but lost more than 1,200 votes over previous elections. The PSOE won a seat their party, Izquierda Unida lost, badly weakened after the split. In 2003 he repeated the same results, being the first mayor of Toledo Molina in being two consecutive terms in office, this time defeating Alejandro Alonso N√∫√±ez.

Most of the residents worked in the collieries at Vron or Plas Power, or in the nearby Brymbo Steelworks. A church dedicated to St. Alban was opened in 1897 as a \\"chapel of ease\\" for the parish church at Southsea.St Albans, Tanyfron , Clwyd Family History Society There were also formerly two nonconformist chapels, Mynydd Seion (Wesleyan, built in 1896) and Cana (Congregationalist). The colliery was served by two railways, a spur of the Great Western Railway's Wrexham and Minera Branch and a branch of the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway. The embankment of the latter is now a footpath still known locally as \\"the Line\\". The Vron Colliery suffered financial problems throughout its history and was eventually closed in 1930; the colliery spoil tips, known locally as the \\"Bonc\\" (from the Welsh word for \\"hillock\\"), were finally cleared in the late 1980s. The major local employer, the Steelworks, expanded across the hillside to Tanyfron in 1976, but closed in 1990 with serious economic effects for the village.

The operation is believed to have begun in November 2009 along five states in the \\"Red Corridor.\\" The term was coined by the Chhattisgarh police officials to describe one successful drive against the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in the state. It was erroneously used by the media to describe the wider anti-Naxalite operations; the government of India does not use the term \\"Operation Green Hunt\\" to describe its anti- Naxalite offensive. Planning and implementation A fleet of Mi-17 V5 has been deployed against the Maoists by the Indian Air Force. In October 2009, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) announced that it was in the final stages of planning the offensive and had received approval from the Union-led government. The Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) would take the lead in the operations against Maoist insurgents. But in September 2009, the media had already reported a \\"massive 3 day joint operation\\" by the CoBRA and Chhattisgarh police against the Maoists in Dantewada. At the beginning of November 2009, the first phase of the operation began in Gadchiroli district. As many as 18 companies of the central paramilitary forces were moved into the area in anticipation of the operation. In April 2010, Mark Sofer had a conversation with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and M. K. Narayanan on the subject of the \\"Maoist extremism\\" and West Bengal's internal security, and offered assistance by Israel in the state's battle against the Maoists. Initially in 2009, the government of India had decided to move 80,000 central paramilitary personnel to wage offensive against the Maoists, strengthened by a fleet of 10 armed helicopters from the Indian Air Force. On 3 January 2013, the government of India issued a statement that it is deploying 10,000 more central paramilitary personnel in Bastar, Odisha and some parts of Jharkhand. By May 2013, about 84,000 troops from the CRPF had been stationed in the Red corridor to beef up the offensive. Apart from the paramilitary personnel, the SAPF personnel deployed in operations against the Maoists are estimated to number around 200,000. In his analysis in March 2014, Gautam Navlakha has claimed that 286,200 CRPF personnel along with 100,000 personnel from other central paramilitary forces and the SAPF are now engaged in the offensive against the CPI (Maoist) in 10 states of India. On 8 June 2014, the Minister of Home Affairs officially approved the deployment of another 10,000 troops from the paramilitary forces to fight against the Maoists in Chhattisgarh. The Times of India, in May 2013, stated that the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to induce 10,000 more paramilitary personal to move \\"towards a fight to finish war against Maoists in Red Zone.\\" The Indian Army has also been stationed in the Red corridor, however, the Army claims that it is present there to train the paramilitary personnel to fight against the Maoists and denies its direct role in the offensive operations. The Chief of the Army Staff and the 7 army commanders in mid-2011 had assessed that, if required, about 60,000-65,000 troops from the Indian Army would need to be induced in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal to battle the Naxalites. On 30 May 2013, the Indian Air Force's Air Chief Marshal declared that apart from the currently operating MI-17 helicopters, the Indian Air Force is inducing a fleet of MI-17V5 helicopters to \\"provide full support to anti-Naxal operations.\\" Recently in August 2014, the Ministry of Home Affairs stated that it is \\"sending\\" 2,000 personnel from the Naga Battalions of the Nagaland's Indian Reserve Battalions (IRB) in Chhattisgarh's Bastar to attack the Maoists, which according to The Economic Times, would make Bastar \\"the most‚Äìmilitarised zone in India.\\" The Naga Battalion personnel are being send to fight the Maoists for a second time, with having battled the Maoists once before in West Bengal. The Indian armed forces' personnel use satellite phones and they also have access to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Security forces have been using UAVs in anti-Maoist operations for quite some time in Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Presently, the UAVs are being provided by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) and Indian Air Force, but they have not been able to yield desired results for the armed forces. Hence, to further advance the offensive, the Defence Research and Development Organisation has taken an initiative to specially develop UAVs with \\"lower frequency radars\\" for the armed forces to \\"track down\\" the Maoists. The NTRO has specially imported 12 drones from Israel for aerial surveillance of Naxalites' activities in the forest region on Andhra Pradesh‚ÄìOrissa‚ÄìChhattisgarh border. The Ministry of Home Affairs says that from 2007 to 2012, the Indian armed forces have killed 905 Naxalites and arrested 12,008. According to an analysis of the news reports by the South Asia Terrorism Portal, 2111 Maoists, 2669 civilians, and 1695 armed forces' personnel have lost their lives in the battle since 2005. Maoists' response As a response to the offensive, the insurgents launched several high-profile attacks on the Indian security forces: *On 15 February 2010 at least 25 policemen died after Maoists overran a security camp in West Bengal state. Naxalite-Maoist leader Kishenji claimed responsibility for the attack. He was quoted as saying that, \\"We have attacked the camp and this is our answer to P. Chidambaram's [the Indian Minister of Internal Affairs] 'Operation Green Hunt' and unless the Centre stops this inhuman military operation we are going to answer this way only.\\" *On 6 April 2010, Maoist rebels killed 75 policemen/CRPF men in a jungle ambush in central India, the most security forces ever killed by the insurgents in a single conflict. On the same day, Gopal, a top Maoist leader, said the attack was a \\"direct consequence\\" of the government's Operation Green Hunt offensive. This raised some voices of use of Indian Air Force against Naxalites, which were however declined citing \\"We can't use oppressive force against our own people\\".http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/Chhatisgarh-attack- consequence-of-Green-Hunt-Maoist-leader/Article1-528028.aspx * On 29 June 2010, At least 26 policemen have been killed in a Maoist attack in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh. * On 11 March 2014, at least 16 people - including 11 CRPF personnel, 4 policemen and 1 civilian -were killed in an ambush in a thickly forested area of Gheeram Ghati in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh. * On 1 December 2014, 14 CRPF personnel, including 2 officers (Deputy commandant B.S Verma and Assistant commandant Rajesh Kauria), were killed in Sukma district of South Chhattisgarh in a Maoist ambush. * On 11 March 2017, 15 CRPF police and a civilian were killed in a Naxalite attack on the border of Bastar and Sukma districts in Chhattisgarh.http://www.livemint.com/Multimedia/RNFnSJIyTGsSA4fkgo3NWN/Naxal- attack-in-Chhattisgarh-leaves-15-CPRF-jawans-dead.html.

To promote the Progress of Science and > useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the > exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. De Wolf wrote in his book \\"An Outline of Copyright Law\\" that one could resolve this statement disjunctively, illustrating the separate grants of authority for copyrights and patents, so that it states \\"(1) The progress of science is to be promoted by securing to authors the right to their writings; and (2) the progress of useful arts is to be promoted by securing to inventors the right to their discoveries.\\" The Supreme Court endorsed this view in 1966 in Graham v. John Deere Co., citing \\"An Outline of Copyright Law.\\" ReferencesExternal links * An Outline of Copyright Law by Richard Crosby De Wolf at Google Books.

He was assassinated during the Irish rebellion of 1803. Early life Thomas Hickey, 1769) Arthur Wolfe was born at Forenaughts House, near Naas, being the eighth of nine sons born to John Wolfe (1700‚Äì1760) and his wife Mary (d. 1763), the only child and heiress of William Philpot, a successful merchant at Dublin. One of his brothers, Peter, was the High Sheriff of Kildare, and his first cousin Theobald was the father of the poet Charles Wolfe. Career Wolfe was educated at Trinity College Dublin - where he was elected a Scholar - and at the Middle Temple in London. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1766. In 1769, he married Anne Ruxton (1745‚Äì1804), and after building up a successful practice took silk in 1778. He and. Anne had four children, John, Arthur, Mariana and Elizabeth.Debrett's Peerage In 1783, Wolfe was returned as Member of Parliament for Coleraine, which he represented until 1790. In 1787, he was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland, and was returned to Parliament for Jamestown in 1790. Appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in 1789, he was known for his strict adherence to the forms of law, and his opposition to the arbitrary measures taken by the authorities, despite his own position in the Protestant Ascendancy. He unsuccessfully prosecuted William Drennan in 1792. In 1795, Lord Fitzwilliam, the new Lord Lieutenant, intended to remove him from his place as Attorney-General to make way for George Ponsonby. In compensation, Wolfe's wife was created Baroness Kilwarden on 30 September 1795; however, the recall of Fitzwilliam enabled Wolfe to retain his office. In January 1798, he was simultaneously returned to Parliament for Dublin City and Ardfert. However, he left the House of Commons when he was appointed Chief Justice of the Kings Bench for Ireland and created Baron Kilwarden on 3 July 1798. Wolfe Tone After the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Kilwarden became notable for twice issuing writs of habeas corpus on behalf of Wolfe Tone, then held in military custody, but these were ignored by the army and forestalled by Tone's suicide in prison. In 1795 he had also warned Tone and some of his associates to leave Ireland to avoid prosecution. Tone's godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall (the father of Charles Wolfe) was Kilwarden's first cousin, and Tone may have been Theobald's natural son. These attempts to help a political opponent were unique at the time. After the passage of the Act of Union, which he supported, Kilwarden was created Viscount Kilwarden on 29 December 1800. In 1802, he was appointed Chancellor of the University of Dublin.Former Pro-Chancellors ‚Äì The Chancellor : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland Despite his actions on behalf of Wolfe Tone, Kilwarden was hated by the United Irishmen for his prosecution of William Orr in 1797, and he had entertained considerable fear for his safety after their failed rebellion. His murder in 1803 is often said to have been a delayed revenge for the death of Orr. Another theory is that it was a case of mistaken identity, the real target being his colleague Hugh Carleton, 1st Viscount Carleton (although several witnesses said that Wolfe identified himself to his killers, who replied \\"You're the one we want\\"). In 1802 he presided over the case against Major Sirr in which the habitual abuses of power used to suppress rebellion were exposed in court.Trial of Mr John Hevey, Plaintiff and Charles Henry Sirr, Defendant, John Stockdale, Dublin, 1802.. Retrieved 4 February 2013.https://books.google.com/books?id=IDSHnsyqZ8IC&pg;=PA61&lpg;=PA61 Niles' weekly register, page 61, Volume 20 By Hezekiah Niles, William Ogden Niles. Retrieved 4 February 2013. Father Gahan In the same year he ordered that the well-known Catholic priest Father William Gahan be imprisoned for contempt of court. In a case over the disputed will of Gahan's friend John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne, the priest refused to answer certain questions on the ground that to do so would violate the seal of the confessional, despite a rulingButler v Moore (1802)(which was overturned in the twentieth century)Cooke v Carroll 1945 IR 515 that the common law did not recognize the seal of the confessional as a ground for refusing to give evidence. The judge may well have felt some sympathy for Gahan's predicament, as he was released from prison after only a few days. Death During the 1803 rebellion, Kilwarden, who had never been forgiven by the United Irishmen for the execution of William Orr, was clearly in great danger. On the night of 23 July 1803, the approach of the Kildare rebels induced him to leave his residence, Newlands House, in the suburbs of Dublin, with his daughter ElizabethHis daughter is referred to in contemporary accounts of the murder simply as Miss Wolfe, which could mean either Mariana (1777‚Äì1814) or her younger sister Elizabeth (1778‚Äì1806), but later sources name her as Elizabeth. and his nephew, Rev. Richard Wolfe.The Parliamentary Register; Or, History of the Proceedings and Debates of ..., Vol III, London, 1804, p 876. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MXpHAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false(accessed 28 February 2017). Thinking that he would be safer among the crowd, he ordered his driver to proceed by way of Thomas Street in the city centre; however, the street was occupied by Robert Emmet's rebels. Unwisely, when challenged, he gave his name and office, and he was rapidly dragged from his carriage and stabbed repeatedly with pikes. His nephew was murdered in a similar fashion, while Elizabeth was allowed to escape to Dublin Castle, where she raised the alarm. When the rebels were suppressed, Kilwarden was found to be still living, and was carried to a watch-house, where he died shortly thereafter. His last words, spoken in reply to a soldier who called for the death of his murderers, were \\"Murder must be punished; but let no man suffer for my death, but on a fair trial, and by the laws of his country.\\" He was succeeded by his eldest son John Wolfe, 2nd Viscount Kilwarden. Neither John nor his younger brother Arthur, who died in 1805, had male issue, and on John's death in 1830 the title became extinct.

It was founded in July 2008 by TU Darmstadt, the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) and the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences. CASED promoted and coordinated cooperation between the three institutions. CASED was part of LOEWE. LOEWE is an initiative of the government of Hesse (Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts) for supporting the development of scientific and economic excellence in Hesse on a long-term basis. The government of Hesse provided funding for the infrastructure of CASED as well as for various projects of the three institutions involved. In those funded projects, computer scientists, engineers, physicians, legal experts and economists of the three cluster partners did basic and application-oriented research. Research and development of new security solutions for important growing areas of IT technology, such as embedded systems and service-oriented architecture, was the ultimate goal of the Center. Subsequently, they hoped to prevent substantial economic damage caused by economic espionage, manipulation, and product counterfeiting. Another aim was to make new techniques and online services run smoothly and safely for both providers and users. CASED merged with the European Center for Security and Privacy by Design (EC SPRIDE) into the Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRISP).

The premises originally opened as 'The Regal' in 1937 and operated as a 1,500 seated cinema up to the 1970s, after which bingo became its mainstay. Purchased by a local company, Coherent Enterprises Ltd, it was extensively refurbished during the second half of the 1980s and was transformed into a 1,200 seated modern concert hall, which opened as 'The Forum' in 1990. The following decade it played host to the top touring acts including: Johnny Cash, The Corrs, David Gray, Van Morrison, Christy Moore, Billy Connolly, and many more. Image:Outside Night.png In 1998 an adjoining licensed premises was purchased by the company, which eventually was converted into a modern off-licence and became part of the national 'Next Door' group. During the millennium year major renovations again took place with Forum Waterford that created a multi-purpose venue downstairs and a separate theatre space upstairs, with the aim of the premises being more versatile. Late Club nights were added to the regular shows and bingo sessions there. A third renovation programme was undertaken by Coherent Enterprises Ltd in 2006-07 which saw the installation of a full kitchen downstairs to add food to the drink and entertainment elements of the business and downstairs was converted into a fine dining 160 seat restaurant with a small stage. The upstairs venue was then solely used for the bingo sessions, live shows (including Calvin Harris, Train, Coronas, Imelda May) and club nights (including the long running indie club - 'Traffik'.) Currently downstairs in Forum Waterford is operated as a Chinese restaurant called 'Peking House', which is open 7 days a week and also does a home delivery service. The off-licence is now a 'Number 21' outlet and is open every day from 10.30pm (12.30pm on Sundays) until 10.00pm nightly. Upstairs has been converted into an exclusive modern 512 seater with tables Bingo Hall, with built-in mechanised bingo (Pongo). Link Bingo takes place nightly with other Clubs around Ireland. It is open every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Sunday with doors at 7.00pm and eyes down at 8.25pm. It finishes at 10.15pm (approx). Visitors are welcome and it is over-16 only.

The first member of the gens to obtain the consulship was Gaius Cestius Gallus in AD 35. The family's name is commemorated on two monuments, the Pons Cestius and the Pyramid of Cestius which survive into modern times.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 674, 675 (\\"Cestius\\"). Origin The nomen Cestius seems to be derived from the cognomen Cestus, referring to an open-fingered boxing glove, or to a girdle. The Cestii probably of Latin origin.Chase, pp. 129‚Äì132. Although the surname Gallus, borne by two of the family, might point to a Gallic origin, another surname of the Cestii, Camerinus, suggests that the Cestii might have claimed descent from the ancient Latin city of Cameria.Chase, pp. 113, 114. At least two other prominent families, the Sulpicii and the Coruncanii, seem to have come from Cameria.Tacitus, Annales, xi. 24. However, the name might also indicate that some of the Cestii claimed descent from the great patrician house of the Sulpicii, who had long used this surname.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 590 (\\"Camerinus\\") Praenomina The praenomina used by the Cestii included Gaius, Lucius, Numerius, Publius, and Titus. Except for Numerius, all of these were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The Cestii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families. The cognomina Gallus, Macedonicus, Proculus, and Severus were probably personal surnames, as was Pius, a rhetorician and a native of Smyrna, who was perhaps a freedman of the gens. Gallus refers to a cockerel, or to someone of Gallic extraction. Macedonicus alluded to the military service of one of the Cestii in Macedonia, while Proculus was an old praenomen that came to be used as a surname in many families. Severus was a common surname meaning \\"grave, serious,\\" or \\"severe\\", while Pius referred to a person known for being dutiful or pious.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary.

It is one of three adult NES games, unlicensed by Nintendo, and released via mail-order by Panesianalong with Hot Slots and Peek-A-Boo Poker. The U.S. licensed version from American Video Entertainment, was released in 1991, with all adult elements removed or obscured. In the same year, a localized version leaving intact those contents was released by Hacker International in Japan as Soap Panic, and still in the U.S. by Panesian. A Genesis / Mega Drive version was released in 1993 which is more suitable for all ages. Summary Gameplay is reminiscent of the classic Tetris (1984) and the succeeding Puzzle Bobble (1994). The goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to others with a matching color along the top screen part. If a sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on the screen reach the playing bottom area, it reaches game over. Finally, when a level is completed the player is rewarded with erotica. Reception Allgame gave this video game a score of 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying \\"Bubble Bath Babes is most notable for being one of three NES games to feature nudity, but its bubble-matching gameplay is good enough to keep it from being just a novelty. Unfortunately, the mild adult content overwhelms the aura of the game, even though it is a small part of the overall package. The topless woman at the bottom of the screen is tastefully depicted, but her inclusion is ultimately gratuitous since she has no effect on the action.\\" Computer and Video Games said \\"The limited graphics make the sauciness factor rubbish\\".

John W. Slayton (1863-1935) was an American socialist lecturer and politician. He is best remembered as one of the Socialist Party of America's leading propagandists in the Eastern United States during the decade of the 1910s. Biography=Early years John W.

Slayton was a carpenter by trade and a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.\\"Warrior Passes: John W. Slayton Dies; Funeral Service Sunday,\\" Reading Labor Advocate, vol. 37, no. 45 (June 7, 1935), pp. 1, 5. Slayton moved to New Castle, Pennsylvania in 1900, where he served for a time as the business agent of the local Building Trades unions. He remained an active member of the Carpenters Union, attending many of the group's national conventions and serving as its delegate to four national conventions of the American Federation of Labor. Political career Socialist Party activists Slayton and Mrs. A.J. Meng address strikers during the 1909 McKees Rocks Strike. John W. Slayton was a pioneer American socialist, a member of the Social Democratic Party of America in the late 1890s. Slayton's first foray into electoral politics came in 1900, when he ran for U.S. Congress on the Social Democratic ticket. When the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party to which Slayton owed his allegiance united with an Eastern-based organization of the same name which had defected from the Socialist Labor Party in 1901, Slayton joined the new organization, known as the Socialist Party of America (SPA). In 1903 Slayton was employed by the Socialist Party as one of its \\"National Lecturers\\" and took to the road throughout the East and Midwest speaking on socialist themes on behalf of the party.A notice issued to the party press by SPA Executive Secretary William Mailly in June 1903 noted that \\"Many letters of commendation have been received endorsing the work of Comrades who are working under the direction of this office. Secretary Nick of the Columbus (Ohio) local writes: 'The Columbus Comrades wish to extend to you their heartfelt thanks for sending them such an able speaker as J.W. Slayton proved to be. The delegates to the state convention were pleased with his clear exposition of class-conscious Socialism. I think, personally, that Comrade Slayton is one of the best speakers on the platform. Keep him on the road.'\\" See: William Mailly, \\"National Headquarter News,\\" June 13, 1903. The Socialist [Seattle], whole no. 150 (June 21, 1903), pg. 3. In 1905, Slayton served as campaign manager for Walter Tyler in his race for Mayor of New Castle. Tyler won the contest, making New Castle the first town in Pennsylvania to have a Socialist at the head of its civic administration. Slayton was himself later elected to the New Castle city council. Slayton was a leader of the 1909 McKees Rocks Strike, a work stoppage by 6,000 steel car workers that, on August 22, the strikers initiated violence, resulted in the death of sixteen people, including the deputy sheriff, two state troopers, and three strikers. Slayton was a delegate to the National Convention of the Socialist Party held in Chicago in May 1908.\\"Delegates to the 1908 National Convention of the Socialist Party,\\" Early American Marxism website.

Retrieved March 11, 2010. Slayton helped finance his two speaking tours of America with the sale of self-published pamphlets. In the fall of 1910, Slayton stood as the candidate of the Socialist Party for Governor of Pennsylvania. Slayton received over 9600 votes in the race, good enough for a third-place finish, although well behind the 48,000 garnered by the winning candidate, Republican John K. Tener.\\"Amazed by Socialist Vote: Democrats Lose Their Place on Official Ballot at Pittsburg.\\" New York Times, November 20, 1910. However, due to the fact that the Democratic vote was split between a \\"Keystone Reform\\" candidate and the candidate of the regular Democratic Party, the Democrats finished fourth. Under Pennsylvania state law, this gave the Socialist Party the third line on the state ballot and a quota of watchers at the polls to which the Democrats ordinarily would have been entitled, thus making fraudulent undercounting of the Socialist vote more difficult in the future. In 1916, Slayton was a candidate for the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, but he was eliminated from consideration after the first ballot. He received 2,714 votes in the referendum of party members, finishing just 23rd of 31 candidates.\\"Choose Hillquit and Berger on First Ballot,\\" The American Socialist,v. 2, no. 36, whole no. 176 (March 16, 1916), pg. 3. Slayton ran for Congress a second time in 1924, standing as a Socialist in the state's 35th District. Two years later, he made a second attempt at becoming Pennsylvania's Governor, again on the Socialist Party ticket. Despite his various political candidacies, Slayton is best remembered as having been one of the Socialist Party's team of professional touring agitators ‚Äî individuals who would be booked through the National Office of the SPA to deliver speeches or engage in public debates, which were akin to a spectator sport in the era before radio, television, or motion pictures. During the course of his career as a public speaker, Slayton toured the breadth of the United States twice, speaking in 46 of the 48 states and defending the Socialist position in 132 debates. Death and Legacy John Slayton died on June 5, 1935 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the age of 72.

Cromwell became the first woman to hold a statewide office in Kentucky when she was elected state librarian in 1896 by a vote of the Kentucky State Senate. Later she won elections for the position of Secretary of State, Kentucky State Treasurer and she was appointed state park director, state bond commissioner, and State Librarian and Director of Archives. Early life and education Emma Guy, the daughter of Ashley and Alice (Quisenberry) Guy, was born on September 28, 1865, in Simpson County, Kentucky and when her father died she spent most of her childhood in the neighboring Allen County, Kentucky. She had one sister and two brothers. Emma attended Howard Female College at Gallatin in Sumner County, Tennessee. She returned to Scottsville, Kentucky to teach at Allen Male and Female College. Later she studied parliamentary law at the University of Michigan. Emma married Frankfort, Kentucky attorney William F. Cromwell on May 30, 1897 in a church ceremony in Bowling Green, Kentucky. William Cromwell was Chief Clerk of the prior State Legislative session. They had one son, William Foree Cromwell. Her husband died in 1909. Political career In 1896, Guy was appointed by the Kentucky General Assembly for the position of State Librarian making her the first female to hold a position in a Kentucky State Office. Given that the state librarian then could not serve successive terms, she took on new roles in public service: serving as the enrolling clerk (1916 to 1918) and parliamentarian of the Kentucky House of Representatives and getting elected to the Frankfort School Board. She also volunteered in women's clubs such as the Daughters of the American Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She also served on the state Parent Teacher Association. In 1918 Cromwell published Cromwell's Compendium of Parliamentary Law. She published in 1920 a booklet, \\"Citizenship, A Manual for Voters,\\" that was dedicated to the \\"new voters in Kentucky\\" -- women. :A strong appeal is made to the women voters of our nation to prepare themselves for public life by keeping in touch with the issues of the day as well as the functions of government. While it is a great privilege to take part in public affairs, and study the questions of the day, so that we can vote intelligently and criticize justly, let us not forget that the home is the most sacred refuge of life, the nucleus around which all pure and true civilization is formed, and that the chief end of all good government is to improve and protect the home, the church and the community. In 1922 she was parliamentarian for the Kentucky House and Senate. In 1923, Cromwell was elected Kentucky Secretary of State in elections that included two other females. The Republicans had nominated Eleanor Wickliffe of Bardstown, and both Cromwell and Mary Elliott Flanery stood for the Democratic Party against three male candidates. Cromwell won both in the primary and then in the general election. She held the office from January 1, 1924 until January 1, 1928. Cromwell discovered the records of previous administrations in the Capitol basement, and retrieved and categorized them. Cromwell was the first woman to serve as acting governor of Kentucky when the two other officials in the line of succession -- Governor William J. Fields and Lt. Gov. Henry Denhardt -- were attending the 1924 Democratic National Convention in New York City. Cromwell went on to be elected Kentucky State Treasurer in 1927, and because of her conservative handling of state money, which was heavily criticized at the time, Kentucky 's state funds remained secure during the Great Depression. Governor Ruby Laffoon appointed Cromwell as Kentucky State Park Director in 1932. In 1937 Governor Happy Chandler named her State Librarian and Director of Archives, a post she then held for several more terms. She arranged for the return of the Kentucky state constitution from the University of Chicago Archives. In 1939, Cromwell published her autobiography, Woman in Politics which was republished in 1996 by The Kentucky Commission on Women. In this book, she praises the suffragist Laura Clay as \\"my main tutor and adviser (65)\\" though there is not much detail in her memoir about any work she did for the Kentucky suffrage movement. Later life and death Cromwell continued to be active in Democratic Party politics until she fell and broke a hip in 1949. Cromwell died on July 19, 1952, of medical complications following a stroke. She is buried in the Frankfort Cemetery, in Frankfort Kentucky. Legacy Cromwell was one of seventeen women given a place of honor in the Kentucky State Capital when their portraits were placed in a permanent display called \\"Kentucky Women Remembered\\". \\"Emma's List\\", a new Political Action Committee created in 1993 to raise funds for female's campaigning for a Kentucky State office, was named in honor of Emma Cromwell.

It comprised a daily diary of all transactions in chronological order. It differs from a daybook in that only a single waste book is kept, rather than a separate daybook for each of several categories. The waste book was intended for temporary use only; the information needed to be transcribed into a journal in order to begin to balance one's accounts. The name of the book derives from the fact that, once its information was transferred to the journal, the waste book was unneeded. The use of the waste book has declined with the advent of double-entry accounting.

Until the delivery date, the book was planned to be called \\"Rites\\", but on 27 February 2010, the name was officially changed to \\"Quarry\\". Plot Scrappy, a 15-year-old boy, lives in a breaker's yard next to the motorway and is being sent crazy anonymous dares. Once he gets caught up in them, he finds he can't stop, no matter how much he wants to, and the last challenges send him to the very edge. Reception The novel was well received by reviewers. Mal Peet, writing for The Guardian, praised \\"Kennen's narrative method\\"; stating that from the plot synopsis itself the novel may be seen to be \\"unremittingly bleak\\", however states that \\"the combination of point of view and pace urges the reader so swiftly on that there simply isn't time for the novel's Grand Guignol imagery to become ponderous\\"; concluding that \\"her grip on noir is as muscular as ever\\". Philip Womack, for The Daily Telegraph, found the novel to be \\"involving and scary\\" and called it an \\"ultra-modern story with a twist\\". The novel received a B rating from Wondrous Reads youth-fiction review website, with reviewer Jenny finding the novel to be a \\"fast-paced ... story of dares and boundaries\\". She found it to be \\"tense and genuinely chilling\\"; but did, however, state that while she found it to be \\"a refreshing read with a sinister twist\\", she further felt that \\"Quarry isn't for those of a nervous disposition!\\".

He played all or part of four seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball from 1948 to 1951. He also served in the Army of the United States as a first lieutenant in the European theater during World War II. Thompson played in Major League Baseball during the Whiz Kids era during a career which spanned 12 seasons (1940‚Äì1941, 1946‚Äì1955). After attending Northeastern University, Thompson appeared as a situational pitcher and spot starter during the 1948, 1949, and 1950 seasons with the Phillies, and went 4‚Äì8 in his only season as a regular member of the team's starting rotation. After demotion to the minors in 1952, Thompson retired from baseball after the 1955 season. Before his major league career, Thompson entered the military and participated in Operation Market Garden, where he led a platoon to secure a bridge over the Maas River. He served in the Army from 1941 to 1945. In 2004, the bridge that his platoon captured was renamed in his honor. Early career Described as a \\"fast ball specialist\\", Thompson played three seasons for the baseball team at Northeastern University, one of six Major League Baseball players to attend the school. During his tenure (1938‚Äì1940), the Huskies won 31 games and lost 14, accumulating a .689 winning percentage. After the 1940 college season, Thompson was signed by Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent. The Red Sox assigned Thompson to their D-level affiliate, the Centreville Red Sox, where he posted an 18‚Äì5 record and a 1.56 earned run average (ERA) in 27 games. He also played in seven games for the Canton Terriers, winning one and losing one and compiling a 3.41 ERA. Under manager Heinie Manush, Thompson played for the Greensboro Red Sox in the Piedmont League during the 1941 season; he amassed an 8‚Äì13 record and a 3.56 ERA in 162 innings pitched. Military service Thompson entered the Army of the United States in 1941 and was assigned to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a part of the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1944, as a first lieutenant, Thompson led his men during an air raid as part of Operation Market Garden. The light in the jump bay of the platoon's C-47 Skytrain was later than expected, moving their landing zone from its intended location near Grave, Netherlands; the plane was passing over buildings when the paratroopers were signalled to leave the aircraft, and Thompson decided to wait until reaching several approaching fields.Ryan, p. 239. Thompson led his platoon in an attack against the nearby bridge spanning the Maas River, which was defended by German forces supplemented by two 20 mm flak guns, one on the close side of the bridge and one across the river. The platoon opened fire on the German forces, killing four. Two trucks of German soldiers arrived on the scene, but they \\"showed no desire to fight ... [and] ran away\\".Ryan, p. 240. Thompson's platoon destroyed \\"electrical equipment and cables that they expected were hooked up to demolitions\\", and their bazooka operator destroyed the nearer flak gun, permitting the establishment of a roadblock on the bridge while waiting for the remainder of the 82nd Airborne. After the battle at the Maas bridge, Thompson also participated in the Battle of the Bulge, where he was given a field commission,Roberts, p. 200. and during the Allied occupation of Berlin, where he served as an aide to General James M. Gavin. Thompson was wounded twice during the war, for which he received two Purple Hearts; fellow pitcher Robin Roberts later wrote that his Phillies teammates \\"understood that Jocko still carried around a considerable amount of shrapnel in his body\\". Other decorations included the Bronze Star with cluster, the Silver Star, and various awards from the Belgian, French, and Dutch governments. Return to baseball Thompson returned to baseball with the Scranton Red Sox of the Eastern League for the 1946 season. He was second on the team in innings pitched (180) and finished with a 13‚Äì7 record in 26 games (20 starts). For the season, Thompson allowed 164 hits‚Äîthe most on the team‚Äîand 97 walks. The following year, he was promoted to the Toronto Maple Leafs, one of Boston's two Triple-A-level affiliates. After he posted a 6‚Äì12 record‚Äîthe team's worst mark among starters with 30 or more appearances‚Äîthe Red Sox did not retain Thompson's rights when their working agreement with the Maple Leafs ended. He remained with Toronto and his rights became the property of the Philadelphia Phillies when those two teams established a new agreement. Thompson and alt=A black-and-white photograph of a man with glasses wearing a dark baseball cap and pinstriped baseball uniform with \\"Phillies\\" in script across the chest In 1948, Thompson went 12‚Äì8 for the Maple Leafs, the second-best win‚Äìloss record among the team's regular starting pitchers (20 or more starts). He was third on the team with 161 innings pitched, allowed the most earned runs (91), and posted a 5.09 ERA. At the end of the season, manager Eddie Sawyer called Thompson and Jim Konstanty up to the major league level. As per the working agreement between the teams, the major league club paid Toronto for the rights to each Maple Leafs player it called up: $25,000 ($ in current terms) for the first player, and $5,000 ($ currently) for each player thereafter.Roberts, p. 140. Sawyer recalled that Pete Campbell, Toronto's owner, and Konstanty \\"didn't get along... [because] they were both the same\\". Although Campbell was \\"glad to get rid of Konstanty\\", he told Sawyer to take Thompson as the $25,000 player because he did not want Konstanty to think he was worth the larger fee. Major league career=1948‚Äì1949 Thompson made his major league debut in the second game of a doubleheader on September 21, 1948. He pitched a complete game against the Cincinnati Reds, allowing one run on five hits, striking out five, and walking five batters to collect the first win of his major league career. He appeared in one other game during the 1948 season, pitching four innings in the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Giants on September 28, allowing three runs in a 6‚Äì3 Philadelphia victory. Thompson wore the uniform number 9 during his brief call-up. Thompson began the 1949 season in the Phillies' starting rotation with Roberts, Ken Heintzelman, Russ Meyer, and Curt Simmons, and the Phillies \\"hoped for contributions\\" from him and some of his teammates, like Schoolboy Rowe and Blix Donnelly.Roberts, p. 172. However, Thompson lost his first two starts, both against the Boston Braves. He was sent down to Toronto, amassing a 14‚Äì5 record there for the 1949 season, and was later described as the team's \\"top pitcher\\" for that year. His 2.73 ERA was second on the team to right-handed starter Bubba Church; Thompson allowed 44 earned runs in 145 innings. He made a spot start in midseason for the Phillies against the Brooklyn Dodgers, but the Phillies lost 8‚Äì4. Thompson did not get his first win in the majors that year until September 19, when he defeated the St. Louis Cardinals behind Howie Pollet, 4‚Äì3. He made his final start of the season for the Phillies on September 24, against Don Newcombe and the Dodgers; the Phillies lost, 8‚Äì1. Thompson finished 1949 with a 1‚Äì3 record at the major league level, with a career-high ERA of 6.89, 12 strikeouts and 11 walks in innings. For his 1949 appearance, Thompson's uniform number was 37. 1950‚Äì1951 Although Thompson was expected to contribute during the 1950 Phillies season and the Whiz Kids' \\"improbable\\" run to the pennant, he spent most of the season with Toronto. On June 8, he defeated the Jersey City Giants, 5‚Äì3, turning in a four-hit performance and striking out 11 batters. He also took a late-game loss in a doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles, as they staged a five- run rally in the ninth inning to defeat Toronto. Again described as the team's top pitcher, he amassed 10 wins and 14 losses, a 4.57 ERA, and led the team with 201 innings pitched. As a batter, Thompson hit two doubles, two triples, and batted in nine runs. He was called up late in the season to reinforce a team that Roberts described as \\"depleted\\";Roberts, p. 294. within one week's time, the Phillies had lost Church to injury, Simmons to military service, and Bob Miller to a recurring back injury.Roberts, p. 228. Thompson appeared in relief of Church after his return on September 15, but the Phillies lost, 5‚Äì0, due in part to a Bobby Thomson inside-the-park grand slam.Roberts, p. 303. In his 1950 major league appearances, he played in two games, pitching four innings and allowing one run. Although Thompson was on the playoff roster, he made no postseason appearances with the team. His uniform number for the rest of his Phillies career was 33. 1951 was Thompson's only full season as a regular in the major leagues, when he beat out Leo Cristante in spring training to make the team. During the preseason, he and Ken Johnson combined for a 1‚Äì0 shutout of the Cardinals. In the regular season, Thompson amassed a 4‚Äì8 record in 14 starts. He made a total of 29 appearances on the season, notching a 3.85 ERA. He won his first game of the year against the New York Giants, 8‚Äì4, on April 23; it was the Giants' fifth straight loss. His first loss of the season came in April in the first game of a doubleheader against the Braves, losing 1‚Äì0 though he held the Braves to two hits. At the plate, Thompson batted .103 with one double and one triple, the latter of which came on June 2 in a 7‚Äì3 defeat of St. Louis. The Phillies and the Reds split a doubleheader in July, with Thompson earning the victory in the nightcap; the Phillies won, 10‚Äì0. In August, Thompson entered in relief in the first inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates after Russ Meyer was knocked out of the contest, staging a \\"respectable duel\\" with Mel Queen to the eighth inning in a 12‚Äì7 Phillies victory; later in the month, he shut out the Reds on three hits to complete a series sweep by the Phillies. Thompson also defeated St. Louis late in the pennant race when the Cardinals were battling the Dodgers for the top position in the league.Roberts, p. 298. After the majors John S.

Minor leagues Thompson returned to the minor leagues for the 1952 season, playing for the Baltimore Orioles, now affiliated with Philadelphia. He led the Orioles in innings pitched (231) and strikeouts (119) as he compiled a 13‚Äì14 record and a 2.49 ERA, third-best on the team. After the season, he played winter baseball in Havana, Cuba, pitching innings in 5 games. Thompson's .714 winning percentage (ten wins and four losses) was best on the 1953 Orioles among pitchers who made 20 or more starts, and he pitched seven complete games. His 1953 ERA was 3.80, and he allowed 16 home runs in 154 innings. When the minor league Orioles moved to Richmond, Virginia, to make room for the transplanted St. Louis Browns of the American League, Thompson left the Phillies' system and remained with the old franchise, the unaffiliated Richmond Virginians, who began play in the 1954 season. Thompson posted an 8‚Äì14 record for the Virginians in 1954; his ERA totaled 5.00 in 29 starts and he placed third on the team in innings pitched (198). His 112 strikeouts led Richmond, as did his 232 hits allowed. After a 6‚Äì16 season and a 5.17 ERA in 1955, Thompson retired from baseball. Post-baseball After his playing days ended, Thompson worked as a sales manager in Maryland.Roberts, p. 357. He died at age 71 on February 3, 1988, and was interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2004, the bridge over the Maas River which Thompson's platoon secured 60 years earlier was renamed the John S. Thompsonbrug (\\"John S. Thompson Bridge\\"). Many veterans of World War II, as well as Thompson's wife, attended the ceremony.

He engaged in a pamphlet dispute with John Dryden. Life He was the younger son of Sir Edward Leigh (1603‚Äì1671), of Rushall, Staffordshire (a scion of the ancient family of West Hall, High Legh, Cheshire and cousin of the Lords Leigh), and Elizabeth Talbot (died 1707), a relative of the Earls of Shrewsbury.Burke's Peerage & Baronetage, SHREWSBURY, E In 1666, aged 16, he entered Queen's College, Oxford. Sources rumour that after university, Leigh left Oxford for London and became an actor in the Duke of York's or King's Company. There were two other actors named \\"Leigh\\" during that period in the company, Anthony Leigh and John Leigh, but no records of a Richard Leigh in either company survive. While he was a young man, Leigh wrote a prose tract attacking poet John Dryden (1631‚Äì1700), entitled \\"The Censure of the Rota on Mr. Dryden's Conquest of Granada, an attack which annoyed Dryden who subsequently called Leigh \\"the Fastidious Brisk of Oxford\\". Some of Leigh's works include \\"Poems on Several Occasions and to Several Persons\\", \\"Greatness in Little\\" (1675), \\"Sleeping on her Couch\\", and \\"The Eccho\\". His will, dated 22 March 1726, was proved on 12 September 1728. He was buried in the Leigh Chapel at St Michael's Church, Rushall. Metaphysical poetry Richard Leigh was among the English lyric poets of the 17th century known as the Metaphysicals. Though not all the poets of the school were aware of one another, most shared an interest in metaphysical matters. Metaphysical is used in the sense of being based on abstract reasoning and transcending physical matter of the laws of nature. As a branch of philosophy, metaphysics concerns the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being and knowing. It is in these senses that it denotes the highly intellectual 17th- century English poets of the school, who are known for subtlety of thought and complex imagery. Their work is marked by bold and ingenious conceits, complexity, and subtlety of thought, frequent use of paradox, and often deliberate harshness or rigidity of expression. Metaphysical poetry is chiefly concerned with analysing feeling. It blends emotion and intellectual ingenuity, characterized by conceit, i. e. by sometimes forced juxtaposition of apparently unconnected ideas and things, which startles the reader out of complacency and into the argument of the poem.\\"Leigh, Richard.\\" The Encyclopedia of National Biographies.

Since words were given thoughts to express, Why should soft words your thoughts conceal? While thus your mind to breathe you teach A language secret as your thought, You sin against the end of speech, Which when it hides to lie is taught. The whispering air so soft does steal, As conscious whom it must obey, Your secret yielding to conceal, Without the least sound slides away. Unwilling to spread forth the news, As dreading to displease the fair, It does through secret pipes diffuse, As loth to mix with common air. Your words with silent motions glide, As gently as from you they came; From ways of noise they far divide, And leave the road of common fame. I'll hunt thee out where'er they bear, And, breathing close, their steps pursue, And, as I gather in the air, Each breath shall voice the winds anew.

It is a branch of the West Coastway Line, a main line railway running between Brighton and Portsmouth. The branch forms a trailing connection with the main line immediately West of the platforms at Barnham railway station and then proceeds in a broadly southwards direction for 3.5 miles to Bognor Regis, where all trains terminate. All trains using the branch to or from Bognor Regis stop at Barnham. The branch is operated with a shuttle train service from Barnham but this is supplemented with through trains to and from Littlehampton, Brighton and London Victoria.

There is only one station on the branch, the terminus at Bognor Regis. History The London Brighton and South Coast Railway had opened the main Coastway line as far as Chichester by 1846 and a station on it named Bognor was located at Woodgate, some 4 miles from Bognor. From that time onwards there were plans for a branch to Bognor, to provide a more convenient rail connection to the town. After many failed proposals the Bognor branch was finally opened on 1 June 1864,Branch Line Britain - Bognor Regis branch line Branch Line britain information regarding the Bognor Regis branch line along with a new station at the junction, named Barnham. The original station called Bognor, about a mile West of Barnham, and another small station at Yapton, East of Barnham, both closed on the same date. When opened, the line was single track but was doubled throughout in 1911. As part of the conversion to double track, the opportunity was taken to re-organise the main line connection at Barnham, to allow through running onto the branch from the London direction, which until that time had not been possible. Electrification The branch was electrified throughout in 1938 along with the West Coastway line as part of the Southern Railway electrification programme. The standard Southern electric traction system using 750 V DC current was installed, power being drawn from a \\"third\\" rail alongside the running line. That same operating system is still in use today. Service All trains on the line are operated by Southern. The typical Monday to Saturday service is four trains per hour.

She fought alongside Ayub Khan and was responsible for the Afghan victory at the Battle of Maiwand on 27 July 1880, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. She is also known as \\"The Afghan Jeanne d'Arc\\" and as \\"The Afghan Molly Pitcher\\" to the Western world. There are many schools, hospitals, and other institutions named after her in Afghanistan. Her story is told in the Afghan school text books. The Pakistani-Pashtun women's-rights activist Malala Yousafzai and Afghan activist-politician Malalai Joya are both named after Malalai of Maiwand. However it must be noted that no British or local sources of that time ever mention her name or such an event from ever occurring. Biography Malalai was born in 1861 in the village of Khig, about 3 miles southwest of Maiwand in the southern Kandahar province of Afghanistan. During the late 1880s, for the second time, Afghanistan was occupied by British-Indian forces attempting to colonise the area and annex it with what was then British India (now Pakistan and India). The main garrison of the British was located in Kandahar, which is the closest city to the town of Maiwand. The military of Afghanistan was represented by commander Ayub Khan, son of Afghan Emir Sher Ali Khan. Malalai's father, who was a shepherd, and her fianc√© joined with Ayub Khan's army in the large attack on the British-Indian forces in July 1880. Like many Afghan women, Malalai was there to help tend to the wounded or provide water and spare weapons. According to local sources, this was also supposed to be her wedding day. Afghan military commanders on 2 September 1880, about a month after their victory at the Battle of Maiwand. When the Afghan army was losing morale, despite their superior numbers, Malalai took the Afghan flag and shouted:Young love! If you do not fall in the battle of Maiwand, By God, someone is saving you as a symbol of shame! This inspired the Afghan fighters to redouble their efforts. When a lead flag-bearer was killed, Malalai went forward and held up the flag (some versions say she used her veil as a flag), singing a landai (a short folk-song sung by Afghan women): With a drop of my sweetheart's blood, Shed in defense of the Motherland, Will I put a beauty spot on my forehead, Such as would put to shame the rose in the garden! Malalai was herself struck down and killed by a British soldier.Afghanistan Declassified: A Guide to America's Longest War By Brian Glyn Williams p 109 However, her words had spurred on her countrymen to victory. After the battle, Malalai was honored for her efforts and buried in her native village of Khig, where her grave remains today. She was 18 or 19 at the time of her death. She is buried in the village of Karez along with her father and fianc√©, locals regard her grave as a shrine.Wagner, Erich. 2012. \\"The Bones of the British Lying in Maiwand are Lonely.\\" Marine Corps University Journal. Volume 3 (1) Spring 2012. Page 46. The Pashtun poet Ajmal Khattak wrote the following lines about Malalai: My Malalai is living, and they praise others' beauty. Though they have eyes, they are blind. Legacy Malalai made an appearance in an animated opening scene of the documentary, He Named Me Malala.  Reception  The authenticity of the story and of Malalai has been questioned by many scholars. Even though she has become well received by the Afghan state and many believe it to be genuine, it seems to be more of a folklore than historical reality. No British historian of that time referred to or mentioned Malalai's name, even the local records are missing. The British author Howard Hensmen, in his book The Afghan War, does mention that one women was found amongst the dead in Ahmad khel, but the battle of Ahmad khail occurred on 19th April 1880, while the battle of Maiwand was on 27th July 1880. Afghan historian Muhammad Siddiq Farhand wrote a three volume book \\"Afghanistan in the past five centuries\\" a very distinguished piece in afghan history, he also failed to mention such a character as Malalai. The first time Malalai's name was mentioned was 40‚Äì60 years after the battle of Maiwand. Many believe it was Abdul Hai Habibi who coined the story during the period of Pashto Tolana to support the national narrative and Pashtun nationalism. Habibi has previously been accused of forgery, in the case of Puta Khazana.

Irving was one of the many towns affected by \\"Big Dam Foolishness\\" during the construction of Tuttle Creek Lake about ten miles to the south. Although the lake never reached the town, the federal government forced remaining residents to vacate the town. History Irving was founded in 1859 by a small group from Lyons, Iowa. They named the town after author Washington Irving. In the spring of 1860, a severe drought ruined crops and forced some farmers to lose their land. Over the summer the area was wracked with fierce winds and thunderstorms that blew down buildings, took roofs and damaged the saw mill. During the fall, some residents chose to leave and return to Iowa.Ghost Towns of Kansas: A Traveler's Guide by Daniel Fitzgerald. University Press of Kansas. Lawrence, Kansas, 1988. In 1866, the community was invaded by grasshoppers that also destroyed crops and damaged trees. The town would have another plague in 1875.

These tornadoes were extensively studied by the pioneer American meteorologist John Park Finley, and author L.

Frank Baum also had a niece, Dorothy Louise Gage, who died in infancy. Some residents left Irving, but the town was rebuilt, and new businesses arrived, allowing Irving to regain its prominence as a local agricultural center. During the summer of 1903, the Big Blue River flooded and destroyed homes, crops and bridges. The river threatened to do it again in 1908 but the townspeople were prepared and were able to keep the river within its banks.

According to an interview with American journalist Robin Wright, he became interested in defending dissidents after being beaten, bayonetted, and having his beard set on fire by Syrian soldiers during a military sweep of Hama in 1981. Wright describes him as having spent \\"most of his life\\" defending Syria's political dissidents, often pro bono, and having sold his automobile and office to pay his bills as a result.Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008, p. 257. He was head of the short-lived European Union-funded human rights training centre in Syria called the Center for Legal Research and Studies until it was shut down by the government following his 2006 arrest. Al-Bunni defended Damascus Spring activist Aref Dalila at his 2002 trial. After presenting a blood-stained handkerchief as evidence that Dalila had been beaten at the prison, he was ordered from the court by a judge and banned from practicing before the Supreme State Security Court.  2006-08 imprisonment  In May 2006 he was detained by security forces after signing the Beirut-Damascus Declaration calling for democratic reform. A year later he was given a five-year sentence for \\"spreading false or exaggerated news that could weaken national morale, affiliating with an unlicensed political association with an international nature, discrediting state institutions and contacting a foreign country\\", according to his lawyer. He was also fined the equivalent of US$2,000 for operating the Center for Legal Research and Studies without government permission. Analysts described the sentence as more severe than those previously given for similar offenses, making it a \\"stark warning to the Syrian opposition\\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, and U.S. President George W. Bush named al-Bunni in a speech as a political prisoner unfairly jailed by Syria. After his release from prison in 2011, he continued to defend the detainees, he escaped from Syria the end of 2014. He is in Germany now working to open the files of war criminals in Syria and transitional justice.  Awards  In 2008 he received the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk. The following year he was awarded the Human Rights Award by the German Association of Judges.

The species was described from 81 fossil specimens collected from Burke Museum site number A0307 in Ferry County, Washington. The holotype specimen, number # UWBM 31299, and the eleven paratype specimens are currently deposited in the collections of the Burke Museum in Seattle, where they were studied and described by Howard E. Schorn and Wesley C. Wehr. Schorn and Wehr published their 1986 type description for A. milleri in the Burke Museum Contributions in Anthropology and Natural History, Volume 1. The specific epithet, milleri, was coined in honor of Charles N. Miller Jr for his contributions to the study and understanding of the conifer family Pinaceae. The studied specimens were excavated from the Tom Thumb Tuff member of the Klondike Mountain Formation in the city of Republic. A. milleri has been placed in the fir genus Abies, which has between 48 and 55 species native to much of North and Central America, Europe and Asia occurring in mountains over most of the range. The characters used to separate extant species of Abies are based on the reproductive structures such as cone scales, wing seeds and bracts. The placement in Abies is based on the dorso-ventrally flattened leaves, and the circular leaf scars, which separate the organs from those of Pseudotsuga and Keteleeria. Within Abies, A. milleri shows similarities with A. kawakamii and A. chensiensis from Asia and with A. concolor and A. lasiocarpa of North America. A. milleri does not show traits which allow placement in any one of the genus Abies sections, however. The 81 specimens studied for the A. milleri description included 40 cone scales, 21 wing seeds, 10 foliated axes, and two detached needles. Schorn and Wehr placed the different detached organ fossils in the same species based on a number of factors. Where visible, all the cone scales have bracts and are morphologically similar. The scales display impressions on the admedial surface of wing seeds that match the fossil seed dimensions. The needle arrangement is consistent on both foliated and defoliated axes, with attached needles matching isolated needles. All of the fossils occurred in the same stratigraphic layers. The cone scales up to and 1.25-2 times as long as wide, have a generally triangular to cuneate shape with the distal edge turned upwards and the stalk on half the length of the scale. Sometimes preserved with cone scales are the bracts which average and have a central accuminate flanked by thinner laminae. The wing seeds are up to and have a pterostegium which covers on average three-quarters of the seed. The narrow obovate seed is generally , 1-1.5 times the length of the upper wing edge while the wing itself is widest in the distal half. Needles of A. milleri reach up to long, but have a width of only at the base. The leaf base is generally as wide to slightly wider than the leaf and round, with the leaf angled approximately 70 degrees upward from the attachment. Leaf scars on axes are circular to slightly oval, , and show a vascular bundle scar in the center. Oval leaf scars are oriented with the long axis parallel to the length of the stem axis. While the scars show the leaves to be in a helical arrangement, the leaves would have had a flattened orientation on either side of the axis.

Wells St. in Chicago purchased by the Chicago Sun-Times in 1977 to investigate widespread allegations of official corruption and shakedowns visited on small businesses by city officials. The journalists used hidden cameras to help ensure that city inspectors caught accepting payoffs for ignoring safety hazards were all properly documented.Lawler, Philip F. \\"The Alternative Influence\\", 1984. p. 38.MacKenzie, Kerry. \\"Chicago\\", 1999. p. 49. In 1978, the Sun-Times broke the story in a 25-part series that documented the many abuses and crimes committed at the tavern, which was shaken down repeatedly by state and local officials. The series was initially nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for general reporting, but the Pulitzer board decided not to award the Sun-Times when editor Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post led an attack on the grounds that the reporters used undercover reporting, a form of deception, to report the story.Silverstein, Ken, \\"Turkmeniscam: How Washington Lobbyists Fought to Flack for a Stalinist Dictatorship\\", 2008. The Mirage gave rise to major reforms including city code revisions, new procedures in city inspections and investigations at federal, state and city levels. The IRS sent in 20 agents to take a closer look at tax fraud by cash businesses. The Illinois Department of Revenue formed a new investigative unit: the Mirage Audit Unit. An ongoing federal investigation, spurred by the Mirage findings, managed indictments of a third of the city‚Äôs electrical inspectors in 1978, with more indictments to come later. The project was overseen by editors James Hoge, Ralph Otwell, Stuart H. Loory and Joseph Reilly.Smith, Zay N. \\"The Mirage\\", 1979. p. vii. In May 1977, journalist Pam Zekman and Better Government Association chief investigator Bill Recktenwald purchased the tavern under the aliases Mr. and Mrs. Ray Patterson.TIME, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919328,00.html Press: Barroom Sting: Bribes Flowed Like Beer\\", January 23, 1978.Wallace, Mike, \\"Close Encounters\\", 1984. pp. 385‚Äì388. Reporter Zay N. Smith, who wrote the series, and BGA investigator Jeff Allen posed as the bartender and manager, respectively. Sun-Times photographers Gene Pesek and Jim Frost posed as repairmen and were in charge of photographing the tavern's activities from a hidden section of the tavern built over the washrooms.https://www.topic.com/the-story-behind-the-chicago-newspaper-that- bought-a-bar Corrupt practices ran the gamut from shakedowns to tax fraud. The shakedown amounts were small, typically less than $100, as the reporters learned of what they later called \\"the supermarket approach to graft--low prices, high volume\\" that inspectors tended to prefer as the safest way of doing illegal business. Among others, a city electrical inspector agreed to overlook the tavern's faulty wiring. A fire department lieutenant agreed to sign off on the tavern's grand opening, despite the loose electrical wiring hanging from rafters and a basement piled high with trash against regulations.Gardiner, John A. \\"Decisions for Sale\\", 1978. p. 81. A city health inspector ignored maggots and sink drains that emptied down to the basement floor. A state liquor inspector ignored fruit flies in the liquor. (The tavern quietly corrected all its code violations, on its own, after the shakedown inspections.) Also reported were illegal kickbacks from pinball operators and jukebox operators (A.A. Swingtime Music Company), as well as tax skimming.Keith, Allan H. \\"Socialism for Survival\\", 1992. pp. 34‚Äì35. Philip J. Barasch, a local accountant, gave the new owners of the bar extensive lessons on how to keep two sets of account books to skim profits without paying tax and advised them exactly what time of day inspectors showed up and how much their shakedowns would typically cost. He also suggested including his business card with any payoffs to help smooth the shakedown process. The only officials he warned against bribing were the police, noting that \\"if you pay off a cop, they keep coming around every month, like flies, looking for a payoff\\". The Mirage, after hearing Barash's tax advice, hired six more accountants specializing in small cash businesses and was counseled by all of them to commit fraud. The tavern, which has had more than one owner since the Sun-Times investigation, is now known, after a number of improvements, as the Brehon Pub.

They cook together five nights a week and pledge to speak German when in the shared areas of the house. On the lower floor of the building, there are two classrooms and other programming spaces for class meetings, film screenings, workshops, a weekly coffee hour, and a Kinder lernen Deutsch class for elementary children. There are occasional exhibitions on German history, literature, and art. History The German House and Cultural Center was constructed in 1999/2000. The $3.2 million project was funded by the Max Kade Foundation and alumni benefactors Richard and Phyllis Duesenberg and Robert and Lori Duesenberg. The two-story, building was designed by Design Organization in the style of the German Bauhaus movement of the 1920s. It was distinguished with Northwest Indiana's 2001 \\"Commercial Project of the Year\\" award, as well as the 2001 Community Improvement Award presented by the Greater Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce and the Porter County Builders Association, Inc. A traditional German ceremony, the Richtfest, marked the \\"topping out\\" or completion of the framework of the Kade-Duesenberg German House and Cultural Center on December 6, 1999. The ceremony included remarks by benefactors and by the president of the campus German Club, Janice Mulholland. Members of the Valparaiso University Brass Ensemble, conducted by Richard Watson, and the Gjallar Quartet provided music; and the newly appointed cultural center director, Dr. Sarah DeMaris, gave a toast in German to the workers, to the donors, and to all who would use the building. The highlight of the Richtfest was the traditional raising of a ribbon-festooned evergreen at the highest point on the building. The German House and Cultural Center was dedicated on September 23, 2000 at a ceremony attended by J√ºrgen Chrobog, German ambassador; Hans-Ulrich Seidt, head of the German Cultural Affairs Department; and major donors Richard and Phyllis Duesenberg, Robert and Lori Duesenberg, Karl and Shirley Kreft, and Henry and June Giebel. The dedication was preceded by a procession of Valparaiso University faculty in academic garb from the University's Chapel of the Resurrection to the new building.

Both CGN and one of the corporation‚Äôs senior advisers, Szuhsiung Ho, have been charged with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material in a manner that is in clear breach of US law.\\" Cyberwarfare China conducts political and corporate espionage to access the networks of financial, defense and technology companies and research institutions in the United States. Email attachments attempting to enter the networks of U.S. companies and organizations exploit security weaknesses in software. A recipient opens an email attachment, apparently from a familiar source, containing a program which embeds in the recipient's computer. The remotely controlled program allows an attacker to access the recipient's email, send sensitive documents to specific addresses and turns on such instruments as web cameras or microphones. In January 2010, Google reported \\"a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google\\". According to investigators, the Google cyber-attack targeted the Gmail accounts of Chinese human-rights activists. At least 34 other companies have been attacked, including Yahoo, Symantec, Adobe, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical. In January 2013, The New York Times reported that it was the victim of hacking attempts originating from China during the previous four months after it published an article on Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. According to the newspaper, the \\"attacks appear to be part of a broader computer espionage campaign against American news media companies that have reported on Chinese leaders and corporations.\\" Chinese cyber-attacks seem to target strategic industries in which China lags; attacks on defense companies target weapons-systems information, and attacks on technology companies seek source code critical to software applications. Operation Aurora emphasized what senior U.S. government officials have called an increasingly serious cyber threat to critical industries. Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that cyberspace could be a fruitful realm for the United States and China to implement a policy of mutually assured restraint allowing both states to take measures they deem necessary for self-defense while agreeing to refrain from offensive steps. Such a policy would require oversight. On August 6, 2020 U.S. President Donald Trump officially extended restrictions against Chinese-owned apps by signing two executive orders that would ban U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok and WeChat, a popular messaging platform run by Tencent Holdings Ltd. The ban, which goes into effect in 45 days, was enacted citing the security risk of leaving Americans‚Äô personal data exposed. 2010‚Äì2012 compromise of CIA network Between 2010 and 2012, China was able to arrest or kill between 18 and 20 CIA assets within China. A joint CIA/FBI counterintelligence operation, codenamed \\"Honey Bear\\", was unable to definitely determine the source of the compromises, though theories include the existence of a mole, cyber-espionage, or poor tradecraft. Mark Kelton, then the Deputy Director of the National Clandestine Service for Counterintelligence, was initially skeptical that a mole was to blame. In January 2018, a former CIA officer named Jerry Chun Shing Lee was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport, on suspicion of helping dismantle the CIA's network of informants in China. Cyber cases In 2007 the computer security company McAfee alleged that China was actively involved in cyberwarfare, accusing the country of cyber-attacks on India, Germany and the United States; China denied knowledge of these attacks. In September 2007 former senior U.S. information security official Paul Strassmann said that 735,598 computers in the U.S. were \\"infested with Chinese zombies\\"; computers infected in this manner can theoretically form a botnet capable of carrying out unsophisticated yet potentially dangerous denial-of-service attacks. A cyber spying network known as GhostNet, using servers primarily based in China, was reported as tapping into the classified documents of government and private organizations in 103 countries (including Tibetan exiles); China denied the claim. APT 1 In December 2009 and January 2010 a cyberattack, known as Operation Aurora, was launched from China on Google and over 20 other companies. Google said that the attacks originated from China, and it would \\"review the feasibility\\" of its business operations in China as a result of the incident. According to Google, at least 20 other companies in a variety of sectors were also targeted by the attacks. According to McAfee, \\"this is the highest profile attack of its kind that we have seen in recent memory.\\"\\"Google Attack Is Tip Of Iceberg\\" , McAfee Security Insights, January 13, 2010 In May 2014, a U.S. Federal grand jury indicted five Chinese military officers for cybercrimes and stealing trade secrets. It was alleged that the Chinese officers hacked into the computers of six U.S. companies to steal information that would provide an economic advantage to Chinese competitors, including Chinese state-owned enterprises. China said that the charges were \\"made-up\\", and the indictment would damage trust between the two nations. Although the indictments have been called relatively meaningless, they could limit travel by the officers due to U.S. extradition treaties. APT 3 In November 2017, the Department of Justice charged three Chinese employees of Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited with hacking into corporate entities in the United States, including Siemens AG, Moody's Analytics, and Trimble Inc. APT 10 Since at least 2013, a Chinese espionage group called TEMP.Periscope by FireEye is reported to have been engaged in espionage against maritime-related subjects. FireEye reported that the information targeted was likely of commercial and economic importance. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) was tied to economic espionage involving stolen business plans, intellectual property, and infringed on private conversations from Westinghouse Electric and United States Steel Corporation.Segal, A. (2018). How China is preparing for cyberwar. The Christian Science Monitor Chinese hackers have stolen information on the Patriot missile system, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the U.S. Navy's new Littoral combat ship. These blueprints of U.S. weapon and control systems were stolen to advance the development of Chinese weaponry.Abad-Santos, A. (2018). China Is Winning the Cyber War Because They Hacked U.S. Plans for Real War. The Atlantic. The protection of the South China Sea is highly important to the U.S. because a Chinese Cyber Unit has already succeeded in an intrusion into the Philippine's government and military networks. Military documents, internal communications, and other sensitive materials related to the dispute were lost due to the cyber invasion.Piiparinen, Anni. 2015. ‚ÄúThe Chinese Cyber Threat in the South China Sea.‚Äù The Diplomat. The Diplomat. September 18 In January and February 2018, Chinese hackers reportedly stole 614 gigabytes of data from a Naval Undersea Warfare Center-affiliated contractor. The compromised material reportedly included information on a project dubbed \\"Sea Dragon\\", as well as United States Navy submarine cryptographic systems and electronic warfare. The New York Times reported that Russia and China are routinely eavesdropping on calls from an iPhone used by President Donald Trump, with China reportedly attempting to influence the President by identifying and influencing the people Trump is regularly in contact with. According to the cybersecurity firm Area 1, hackers working for the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force compromised the networks of the AFL‚ÄìCIO in order to gain information on negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of a campaign called Cloudhopper, hackers working for the Ministry of State Security compromised the networks of IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and used that access to compromise those companies' clients. The Cloudhopper attacks began no later than 2014, and included targets in Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In October 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek published a story which alleged that Supermicro's contractors in China had been compromised by the People's Liberation Army to implant microchips with hardware backdoors in its servers. The report was widely disputed by the sources and companies who were named within. In March 2019, iDefense reported that Chinese hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the United States Navy. Some of the targets included the University of Hawaii, the University of Washington, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The attacks have been underway since at least April 2017. In July 2020, the United States department of justice indicted that two Chinese Hackers were charged with global computer intrusion campaign targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research. Two Hackers worked with the Guangdong State Security Department of the Ministry of State Security (China). Higher education United States canceled the visas of 1,000 Chinese students and researchers. The authorities accused the students that they had ties with the Chinese military and also accused some of them of espionage. The United States first started revoking visas since 1 June 2020.

A stonelayer occupies the basal horizon of two-layered soil biomantles (Paton et al. 1995; Schaetzl and Anderson 2005; Fey 2009; Wilkinson et al. 2009). A stonelayer may be one stone thick, and thus appear in a trench or pit as a \\"stone line,\\" or it may be several stones thick and appear as a \\"stone zone\\" (Johnson 1989). The gravel components of stonelayers may be compositionally variable, and while many are lithic clasts, often of quartzose composition, others may be metallic nodules and concretions of iron and manganese oxides, human artifacts, snail and clam shells (in highly calcareous soils), precious and semi-precious stones, or some combination thereof (Aleva 1983, 1987; Johnson 2002). History Few topics in the annals of Earth science have generated more controversy and genetic uncertainty than have stonelayers (stone-lines) in soils and sediments. The controversy has involved the fields of archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, ecology, pedology, and soil science, has encompassed all continents except Antarctica, and occupies an extensive literature. The term ‚Äòstone-line‚Äô was coined and defined in 1938 by Sharpe based on observations in South Carolina, and interpreted as a product of abiotic, more or less geogenic mass transfer on slopes. Sharpe was apparently unaware that predecessor names had been coined in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, involving such terms as ‚Äúpebble line,\\" ‚Äúgravel sheet,\\" ‚Äúcascalho,\\" and others, usually depending on the language employed and the countries where the observations were made. Nor, apparently, was Sharpe aware that such features earlier had been illustrated graphically‚Äîin England by Darwin (in 1840 and 1881), in Brazil by Hartt in 1870, in North America by Webster and Shaler (in 1888 and 1891 respectively), and by others. Neither was he aware that the feature had been interpreted between 1898 and the 1880s in the midcontinent of North America as an eroded lag on soils and paleosols that later became buried, and variously named ‚Äúferretto zone,‚Äù ‚Äúpebble band,‚Äù ‚Äúpebble concentrate,‚Äù plus others by such notable North American geologists as Bain, Sardeson, Calvin, Norton, Savage, Tilton, Leverett, and Kay, among others (Johnson et al. 2005). In tropical and subtropical Brazil in the 1870s, Agassiz and Hartt viewed the stonelayer and material above it as evidence for glaciation, a view resurrected by others as recently as the 1960s. This two- layered unit was alternatively interpreted as an erosional pavement buried under tropical loess in the 1890s, a view re-adopted by others recently (1980s-2000s) for northern Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil. However, Morr√°s and colleagues (2009) have argued that stonelayers in these soils are basal components of soil biomantles. After World War II, the stonelayer was given new names, ‚Äúcarpedolith,‚Äù ‚Äúchert-line,‚Äù ‚Äúnappes de gravats,‚Äù ‚Äúlit de cailloux d‚Äôepaisseur,‚Äù ‚Äúconcentration de quartz,‚Äù ‚Äúlinea de piedras,‚Äù ‚Äúnodular layer,‚Äù ‚Äústiensohle,‚Äù ‚Äúbiogenic marker horizon,‚Äù ‚Äúgravel horizon,‚Äù and ‚Äúpedisediment,‚Äù among others. The common presence in them of human artifacts, precious-semiprecious stones (diamonds, emeralds, etc.) and metals (gold, silver, tin, etc.) has piqued the interest of geologists, geographers, archaeologists, mining specialists, and engineers (Aleva 1983, 1987; Brink 1985; Brink et al. 1982; Johnson et al. 2005; Ruhe 1959, 1969). Some have attributed the explanatory controversy surrounding stonelayers to a perceived narrow and limiting 20th century theoretical-interpretive-explanatory tradition in pedology and soil science (Johnson et al. 2005; Johnson and Johnson 2006). According to this view, explanatory pedology has operated under a predominantly soil science utilitarian-conceptual approach, or model‚Äîthe five factors (‚Äòclorpt‚Äô) model‚Äîto map, classify, valuate, and ‚Äúexplain‚Äù soils (Jenny 1941; Soil Survey personnel 1951, 1975, 1991, 1993). While the model has greatly aided soil science, and spatially explains generalized soil- environmental relationships on landscapes, the device‚Äîsupremely attractive in its parsimony‚Äîhas constrained pedologic interpretation because its genetic- interpretive domain is constrained by its broad factorial (landscape context) tenets. The model allows for a wide-ranging generalized assessment of soilscapes, and is useful in soil chronosequence work (Birkeland 1974, 1984) but the biodynamic soil processes that are largely responsible in producing stonelayers are absent at a highest theoretical (five factors) level. Once mapped and classified, soils become static elements, which‚Äîwhile societally useful, scientifically misrepresents their true biodynamic nature. In a proposal to heal such Occam's razor wounds, process biodynamics supported with appropriate genetic language has been advanced to augment the traditional five factors genetic principles in pedology and soil-geomorphology. A process- biodynamic approach, with supporting genetic language, provides a way forward and fosters a fresh array of interpretive options. References Aleva, G.J.J. 1983.

Early life, education Allah Baksh was born on January 21, 1907, in the city of Karachi. After his matriculation, he went to the D. J. Science College, earning a B.A. with Honors. During this period he began participating in Sindhi culture and poetry, in which he had had a deep interest since his childhood. Work Allah Bux published his first book, Ramooz-un-Nisa in 1920, his second in 1923, Dawat-e-Islam, in 1924 Manasik-e-Hajj and in 1929 Khalid bin Walid. During this time his poetry and articles used to appear in magazines like Al-Waheed, Sindh Madarisa magazine, Al-Hafiz al-jamia Sindh College. He wrote in Urdu for the magazine Tasawuff, published in Lahore under the pen name \\"Sarshar 'Uqaili\\". He also served as the editor of Al-Waheed newspaper for four years. From 1942 till 1945, Uqaili served as chief Officer of District Local board in Karachi, in the same period he was the president of Rajmikal music club in Karachi and wrote a book entitled as The history of Sindhi Rag (Sindhi mystic folks). Also, books like ilm-e-hinat (\\"The Study of Astronomy\\") appeared in his name. In 1947, when Pakistan and India separated, he was given the office of \\"food and livestock\\" in the government of Sindh and used to broadcast historical and literary speeches from Radio Pakistan, and wrote for Nai Zindagi magazine. From 1950 to 1953, Sarshar Uqaili served as City Mayor of Karachi. In October 1950, he founded a center for literary studies and served as its President, and served in many other such centers. His affection for Sindh poetry led him to compile a large collection of Sindhi national poems with the title Sindh Jo Tarano, which was published by the Sindh Society. In November 1955, he founded the Sindh Library in Karachi and at the same time founded the Bazm-Talib-ul-Mola academy in Hyderabad. Due to all these efforts, Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman Talib-ul-Mola declared him as his vice-regent in 1952. After that, he ran the office of Director of Settlement Services in Hyderabad. Following his tenure at that post, he was designated as Commissioner and District Magistrate of Hyderabad and stayed as chairman of the Sindhi Adabi Board from March 1955 to September 1961. Amongst his other contributions is that he collected his family tree. In his last days, Uqaili suffered dacoity at his house in Thatta. His personal library, with all of his writings, was stolen and many of his works were lost. Since then, much of his work is believed to have been plagiarized. On January 15, 1971, when he was 64, the Sufi poet died and was buried in his ancestral graveyard in Thatta, leaving behind a widow, his younger brother N M Uqaili, four daughters and a son who married the granddaughter of Allama Makhdoom Muhammad Hashim Thattvi.

They were an inaugural member of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League and were owned by future WWE CEO Vince McMahon.  History  McMahon owned the Cape Cod Coliseum and wanted to secure an American Hockey League franchise for the arena. When he was unable to finalize plans for the 1981‚Äì82 season, McMahon was approached by Frazier Gleason of Indianapolis who wanted to run an franchise in the new Atlantic Coast Hockey League. Gleason and McMahon worked together during the early stages of building the team; however, McMahon assumed full control over the franchise after it became evident that Gleason did not have sufficient funds to run the team. McMahon hired former New Haven Nighthawks right wing Jim Troy to serve as the team's coach and general manager. After the first month of the season, two of the league's franchises folded. On February 1, 1982, the Winston-Salem Thunderbirds announced that they would have to fold, unless the season ended early. The league went into an emergency meeting and decided to hold the post-season immediately. McMahon disagreed with the decision, which he felt would hurt the league's credibility, and chose to fold the team. In their only season in the ACHL, the Buccaneers went 17-21-1.

It works by reducing lung fibrosis through downregulation of the production of growth factors and procollagens I and II. It was first approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after clinical trials, under the trade name of Pirespa by Shionogi, in 2008. It was approved for use in the European Union in 2011, in Canada in 2012, and in the United States in October 2014. There is also a topical form created for the treatment of abnormal wound healing processes.Coadjuvant treatment with surgery and pirfenidone in severe facial trauma due to dog bite. The journal of Craniofacial Surgery, volume 24, Number 2, March 2013 Medical uses In Europe, pirfenidone is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2011. In October 2008, it was approved for use in Japan, in India in 2010, and in China in 2011 (commercial launch in 2014). In October 2014, it was approved for medical use in the United States. A tablet version was approved for use in the United States in January 2017. In Mexico it has been approved on a gel form for the treatment of scars and fibrotic tissueA controlled clinical trial with pirfenidone in the treatment of pathological skin scarring caused by burns in pediatric patients, annals of plastic surgery, volume 68, number 1, January 2012 and has proven to be effective in the treatment of skin ulcers Adverse effects=Gastrointestinal Pirfenidone is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as dyspepsia, nausea, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and vomiting. To reduce the severity of these reactions, pirfenidone is to be taken after meals. Skin Pirfenidone is known to cause photosensitivity reactions, rash, pruritus and dry skin. Patients are usually advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, including sun lamps, and to use protective clothing and sunscreening agents. Continuing photosensitivity reactions are usually managed by dose adjustment and temporary discontinuation of treatment if required, along with local symptomatic treatment. Hepatic dysfunction Pirfenidone can increase hepatic enzyme levels, especially those of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; periodic monitoring of hepatic enzyme levels is required during therapy: once before the initiation of therapy, monthly monitoring until 6 months after initiation of therapy, and 3 monthly thereafter. Extra precaution is required while prescribing the drug in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are concomitantly taking a CYP1A2 inhibitor. The drug is contraindicated in patients who have severe hepatic impairment. Dizziness and fatigue Dizziness and fatigue have been reported in patients undergoing pirfenidone treatment. Dizziness typically resolves, although patients should know how they react to pirfenidone before undertaking activities that need mental alertness or coordination. If severe, dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation may be required. Weight loss Weight loss has been reported in patients treated with pirfenidone. Doctors should monitor patients‚Äô weight and encourage increased caloric intake if necessary. Interactions Most drug interactions are mediated by various cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP1A2 inhibitors Since Pirfenidone is metabolised through the CYP1A2 enzyme pathway, any drug which inhibits this enzyme is likely to precipitate the toxicity of pirfenidone: concomitant therapy is to be avoided. Fluvoxamine is contraindicated in patients who are on treatment with pirfenidone. Other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as ciprofloxacin, amiodarone and propafenone should be used with caution. Other CYP inhibitors Some pirfenidone is also metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes other than CYP1A2. Consequently, strong inhibitors of other cytochrome P450 enzymes such as fluconazole (CYP2C9), chloramphenicol (CYP2C19), fluoxetine and paroxetine (both CYP2D6) should be used with caution. CYP1A2 inducers Moderate inducers of CYP1A2 such as omeprazole should be used with caution since they might reduce the circulating plasma levels of the drug. Cigarette smoking Cigarette smoking causes increased clearance of pirfenidone by inducing CYP1A2, thereby decreasing exposure to the drug. Patients must be advised to abstain from cigarette smoking while on therapy with pirfenidone. Pharmacology=Mechanism of action Pirfenidone has well-established antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in various in vitro systems and animal models of fibrosis. A number of cell-based studies have shown that pirfenidone reduces fibroblast proliferation, inhibits transforming growth factor beta stimulated collagen production and reduces the production of fibrogenic mediators such as transforming growth factor beta. Pirfenidone has also been shown to reduce production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-1Œ≤ in both cultured cells and isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These activities are consistent with the broader antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities observed in animal models of fibrosis. Pharmacokinetics Pirfenidone is administered orally. Though the presence of food significantly reduces the extent of absorption, the drug is to be taken after food, to reduce the nausea and dizziness associated with the drug. The drug is around 60% bound to plasma proteins, especially to albumin. Up to 50% of the drug is metabolized by hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme system to yield 5-carboxypirfenidone, the inactive metabolite. Almost 80% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours of intake. History The drug was developed by several companies worldwide, including the original patent holder, Marnac, InterMune (now part of Roche), Shionogi, and GNI Group. Preclinical studies in models of fibrosis In animal models, pirfenidone displays a systemic antifibrotic activity and has been shown to reduce biochemical and histopathological indices of fibrosis of the lung, liver, heart and kidney. Pirfenidone demonstrates a consistent antifibrotic effect in several animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. Of these, the bleomycin model is the most widely used model of pulmonary fibrosis. In this model, bleomycin administration results in oxidative stress and acute inflammation, with the subsequent onset of pulmonary fibrosis in a number of animal species including the mouse and hamster. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pirfenidone attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. One study investigated the effect of pirfenidone over a 42-day period after repeated bleomycin administration. Administration of pirfenidone minimised early lung oedema and pulmonary fibrosis when treatment was initiated concurrently with lung damage. This study evaluated pulmonary protein expression and found pirfenidone treatment normalised expression of proinflammatory and fibrogenic proteins. Similar reductions in pulmonary fibrosis were observed when pirfenidone treatment was delayed until pulmonary fibrosis was established and progressing, i.e. when administered in a therapeutic as opposed to a prophylactic treatment regimen. The antifibrotic effect of pirfenidone has been further established in animal models of cardiac (heart), renal (kidney), and hepatic (liver) fibrosis, as well as in Dupuytren's contracture. In these models, pirfenidone demonstrated a consistent ability to reduce fibrosis and the expression of fibrogenic mediators. Pirfenidone has also been shown to inhibit spondyloarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes and osteoblasts in vitro.Stougaard J, Lomholt S, Ommen P, Kelsen J, Kragstrup TW. The antifibrotic drug pirfenidone inhibits spondyloarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes and osteoblasts in vitro. BMC Rheumatol. 2018;2:33. Published 2018 Nov 19. doi:10.1186/s41927-018-0040-9 Clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis The clinical efficacy of pirfenidone has been studied in three Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The first Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was conducted in Japan. This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, trial, in which 275 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to receive pirfenidone 1800 mg/day (110 patients), pirfenidone 1200 mg/day (56 patients), or placebo (109 patients), for 52 weeks. Pirfenidone 1800 or 1200 mg/day reduced the mean decline in vital capacity from baseline to week 52 compared with placebo. Progression-free survival was also improved with pirfenidone compared with placebo. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled Phase III studies in eleven countries across Europe, North America, and Australia. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to treatment with oral pirfenidone or placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks. In study 004, pirfenidone reduced decline in forced vital capacity. Mean change in FVC at week 72 was ‚Äì8.0% in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and ‚Äì12.4% in the placebo group, a difference of 4.4%. Thirty-five (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients, respectively, had a decline in forced vital capacity of at least 10%. In study 006, the difference between groups in forced vital capaticy change at week 72 was not statistically significant. Mean change in forced vital capacity FVC at week 72 was ‚Äì9.0% in the pirfenidone group and ‚Äì9.6% in the placebo group. The difference between groups in change in predicted forced vital capacity at week 72 was not significant. In May 2014, the results of another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 555 patients were published. They confirmed observations from previous clinical studies that pirfenidone significantly reduced the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as measured by change in percent predicted forced vital capacity from baseline to week 52. In addition, significant treatment effects were shown on both of the key secondary endpoints of six-minute walk test distance change and progression-free survival. A pre-specified analysis of the pooled population of 1,247 subjects from three studies showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 48% in the pirfenidone group compared to the placebo group. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that pirfenidone appears to improve progression-free survival and, to a lesser effect, pulmonary function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Randomised studies comparing non-steroid drugs with placebo or steroids in adult patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were included. Four placebo-controlled trials of pirfenidone treatment were reviewed, involving a total of 1155 patients. The result of the meta-analysis showed that pirfenidone significantly reduces the risk of disease progression by 30%. In addition, meta-analysis of the two Japanese studies confirmed the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on the change in vital capacity from baseline compared with placebo. Regulatory progress In May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve the use of pirfenidone for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, requesting additional clinical trials. In December 2010, an advisory panel to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended approval of the drug. In February 2011, the European Commission granted marketing authorisation in all 27 EU member states and the China Food and Drug Administration granted approval in September 2011. Afterwards, a randomised, Phase III trial was completed in the U.S. in 2014, with regulatory approval in U.S. following shortly after. In October 2010, the Indian Company Cipla launched the drug as Pirfenex, and MSN laboratories launched it as Pulmofib. It was approved for use in Europe in 2011 under the trade name Esbriet; it was approved in Canada in 2012 under the same name; and was approved in the United States in October 2014, also as Esbriet. In September 2011, the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration provided GNI Group Ltd with new drug approval of pirfenidone in China, and later manufacture approval in 2013 under the trade name of Etuary. In 2014, it was approved in Mexico under the name KitosCell LP, indicated for pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis.kitoscell.com In Mexico it has also been approved in gel for the treatment of chronic wounds and skin injuries and the oral form it is approved for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis. Research Other research shows that pirfenidone may be an effective anti- fibrotic treatment for chronic liver fibrosis.

It affects civil servants, who must be politically impartial, preventing central and local government from making announcements about any new or controversial government initiatives (such as modernisation initiatives or administrative and legislative changes) that could be seen to be advantageous to any candidates or parties in the forthcoming election. Purdah does not apply to candidates for political office. Where a court determines that actual advantage has been given to a candidate, this may amount to a breach of Section 2 of the Local Government Act 1986. At its weakest, the time period brings a moral commitment for executive officers not, unless ordered by elected representatives, to enter into any transactions or carry out any works which would conflict with the stated intentional commitments (manifesto) of the cabinet or shadow cabinet and possibly other candidates.  Etymology  The name itself comes from the Urdu word meaning \\"curtain\\" or \\"veil\\", describing the ensuring of women's modesty from the world of men.  Practice and legal status  The purdah period typically begins six weeks before the scheduled election, in each authority on the day the notice of election is published; for the 2017 elections to Combined Authority Mayors, purdah began on 23 March. For the 8 June 2017 General Election, purdah began on 22 April, and for the 12 December 2019 General Election, purdah commenced on 6 November. Purdah has been imposed in ministerial guidance since at least the early 20th century reflecting an earlier \\"self-denying ordinance\\", and has considerable moral authority, its breach carrying with it in worst cases the possibility of actions for abuse of power and misconduct in public office. Otherwise its lack of statute or common law means different local authorities adopt different standards as to the extent to which they observe the convention, and executives are always mindful of the possibility of decisions being open to judicial review on the grounds of legitimate expectations, breach of natural justice, or procedural impropriety if purdah is breached. Where observed by executive officers, purdah bars entering into any transactions or carrying out any works which would clearly or directly conflict with the stated intentional commitments (manifesto) of the cabinet or shadow cabinet in any authority. When local elections are being held at the same time as a general election, this higher standard is usually applied. At the national level, major decisions on policy are postponed until after the purdah period, unless it is in the national interest to proceed, or a delay would waste public money. The Cabinet Office issues guidance before each election to civil servants, including those in the devolved national parliaments and assemblies. Purdah also continues after the election during the time in which new MPs and ministers are sworn in. In the event of an inconclusive election result, purdah does not end until a new government forms. When no party has an overall majority, it may take some time before a minority or coalition government is formed. Section 2 of the Local Government Act 1986 prohibits the publication by local authorities of material which, in whole or in part, appears to be designed to affect public support for a political party.  Local government  For local elections in England and Wales, the activities of local authorities in the pre-election period are governed by the Recommended code of practice for local authority publicity, Circular 01/2011, issued as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1986. Section 39 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 inserted sections 4A and 4B into the Local Government Act 1986 which provide powers for the Secretary of State to issue a notice to comply or explain, followed after non-compliance, by a direction; and to issue a more general Order if approved by Parliament across multiple authorities to comply in some respects with provisions of the recommendatory, good practice, code. The code mentions at the outset that it in no way detracts from the section 2 offence of the Act. Purdah in local government ends on the close of polls which, for ordinary elections, is usually on the first Thursday in May. National Health Service Although NHS staff are not generally regarded as civil servants, purdah is increasingly enforced on NHS bodies. In 2017 it was decided that the financial result of the NHS provider sector, normally published in May each year, should be postponed until after the General Election. This was controversial, and was seen by many as an attempt by the government of the day to gag NHS bodies from publishing information it saw as a threat to its general election campaign.  Referendum on elected mayors  In the 2012 referendum on elected mayors for the core cities of Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, and Wakefield an extra purdah restriction was introduced, namely that from 6 April councils were not be able to promote in an opinionated manner the referendum by publishing articles or issuing press releases. However, public information in the form of questions and answers was still permitted to be on the council's website, and press officers were able to respond to enquiries from the media.  Social media  In the 2010 United Kingdom general election, specific guidance was issued to executive departments about their use of social media, as opposed to that of political representatives, for example \\"Use of Twitter may continue for publishing factual information only in line with guidance on news media\\". Civil servants are urged not to post anything political on social media. In the 2015 United Kingdom general election, general guidance about use of websites, blogs and social media was provided.

It is sponsored by the Johannesburg-based infotech firm Dimension Data and named after parent company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.  History = Foundation  The team was founded in 2007, becoming a Continental Team in 2008. The team remained as a UCI Continental Team until the end of the 2012 season, with the team registering its interest for a Professional Continental licence for 2013 under the name MTN-Qhubeka. In November 2012, the team were registered as a Professional Continental team ‚Äì Africa's first ‚Äì by the Union Cycliste Internationale, for the 2013 season. The team achieved their first major win in 2013 when Gerald Ciolek won Milan-San Remo, one of the 5 Monuments of cycling. The team received their first Grand Tour wildcard for the 2014 Vuelta a Espa√±a. In July 2014, the team announced that for the 2015 season they would be using Cerv√©lo bikes with Brian Smith being appointed interim general manager. In August 2014, the team confirmed the signing of Edvald Boasson Hagen on a 2-year contract. In September 2014 the team announced they had signed Tyler Farrar and Matthew Goss for the 2015 season.  First African Team in Tour de France  On 14 January 2015, the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) announced the 22 teams that would participate in the 2015 Tour de France, with MTN-Qhubeka making history as the first African registered team to take part. Steve Cummings brought the team their first stage win of the Tour, stage 14 on Mandela Day. The team's second Grand Tour stage victory came the following month at the 2015 Vuelta a Espa√±a, where Kristian Sbaragli won a reduced bunch sprint on stage 10. Daniel Teklehaimanot made history in the 2015 Tour de France when he spent four days in the race‚Äôs polka-dot jersey, becoming not only the first Eritrean but the first African to wear that jersey. The success brought him to the attention of the wider cycling world.  Dimension Data as new sponsor  In July 2015, MTN announced they would end their sponsorship of the team. Two months later, Dimension Data was announced as the team's new primary sponsor. The new team name would be \\"Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka\\"; the change in name was intended to demonstrate that the team supported the Qhubeka bicycle charity rather than receiving sponsorship for them. The change came at the same time as rumours were circulating that Mark Cavendish and his lead-out man Mark Renshaw were about to sign with the team for the 2016 season. Days later the team announced Deloitte had agreed to become a major sponsor of the team; the very next day the signing of Cavendish and Renshaw ‚Äì along with their former teammate Bernhard Eisel ‚Äì was confirmed. In November 2015, the team announced that Rolf Aldag had been appointed as the team's Performance Manager with immediate effect, following Cavendish and Renshaw from . Later that month Roger Hammond announced that he would join the team as a sports director for 2016, combining the role with his current position as manager of the squad, and it was confirmed that the team had been granted a UCI World Tour licence for the 2016 season, becoming the first African team to enter cycling's top division.

By the time Foster was stopped, police discovered his scheme, originally called KF Concept but later renamed to Phase 9, had taken money from 8,500 investors, mainly drawn in through his series of flamboyant roadshows across the UK. In 2010, Foster was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, though that was reduced to 9 years on appeal after several convictions were overturned.  Trial and conviction  On 9 March 2010, Kevin Foster was convicted at Harrow Crown Court in northwest London, following a seven-week trial which began on 18 January 2010.Serious Fraud Office - KF Concept ¬£34 million Ponzi scheme organiser convicted BBC - Gambler warned he faces jail over ¬£34m pyramid schemeHerald Sun - Man guilty of $56m pyramid scams Foster faced 8 charges under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and 8 offences under the Theft Act 1968. The jury found him guilty on 14 of the charges, but acquitted him of one theft charge in relation to ¬£220,000 of cash found at his home, and failed to reach a verdict on another relating to a Ferrari Spyder he owned. On 16 April 2010 Foster was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, Judge Nick Madge described the fraud as being \\"a substantial and deliberate course of conduct that was sophisticated and elaborate\\".

From there, he expanded his scheme, named it KF Concept in 2002, and launched a series of roadshows in England, Wales and Scotland.Business Week - U.K. Soccer-Betting Ponzi Schemer Convicted of Fraud The roadshows were flamboyant, with Foster appearing on stage backed by music, often ABBA's Money, Money, Money, presenting himself as a gambling expert who could deliver great profits to his investors from betting on soccer and horse racing. Foster claimed that for every ¬£1 invested, he was earning ¬£28.50, that he had already recruited 50,000 members, and that the scheme held assets of ¬£203m.The Telegraph - Former taxi driver who conned millions in Ponzi scheme convicted The highlight of Foster's presentations came when previous investors' names were drawn by lottery, with the lucky winners being paid their promised returns early, in front of the crowd. Further prizes included cars, and even the loan of Foster's Ferrari. This show of money satisfied the doubts of many investors, who weren't aware that, in classic Ponzi style, it was being paid out of new investors' deposits rather than from any profits from the scheme. At least 8,000 people were drawn in, investing a minimum of ¬£1,000, with an estimated average of ¬£4,200 each. In 2003, Foster dropped the name KF Concept after negative publicity, renaming the scheme Phase 9.  Investigation  In January 2004, the Kent Police, together with the Financial Services Authority, investigated Foster's investment affairs, and the following month halted his activities, discovering that by that time he had collected a total of ¬£34m from more than 8,500 investors. The money that Foster had claimed his scheme controlled was not there, and he had made no profits from any gambling activities. A freezing order was obtained, and Foster was declared bankrupt, with his investors losing everything. The case was referred to the Serious Fraud Office, who, after investigations, charged Foster in May 2007, leading to 2010's trial and conviction. During the course of the investigation, it was found that ¬£12m of the money raised had been channeled into an illegal pyramid investing scheme, Planline, thought to be based in the Cayman Islands, of which only ¬£1,703 was ever recovered.Times - Former cab driver convicted of ¬£34m fraudCayman Net News - Fraudster convicted over Cayman-run Ponzi scheme It was also discovered that Foster had used large sums from the scheme to fund an extravagant lifestyle, buying a ¬£600,000 farmhouse near Sittingbourne, Kent, which he stocked with exotic animals and where he installed Koi carp ponds. A further ¬£700,000 was spent on cars, and it was estimated that Foster had withdrawn ¬£3m in cash.  Victims  Foster mainly targeted low-income people in small, close-knit, communities, many of which were in the valleys of South Wales.

He was the only German judge who attempted to stop the Action T4 euthanasia program, an intervention that cost him his job. After the Second World War, he was again offered a judgeship, but declined. Later, he became an advocate of German reconciliation and founded the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace and the German development aid non-government organization, Action for World Solidarity.  Biography = Early years  Lothar Ernst Paul Kreyssig was born in Fl√∂ha, Saxony, the son of a businessman and grain merchant. After elementary school, he attended a gymnasium in Chemnitz. He set aside his education and enlisted in the army in 1916, during the First World War. Two years of service in the war took him to France, the Baltics and Serbia. After the war, between 1919 and 1922, he studied law in Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1923. In 1926, he went to work at the district court in Chemnitz and two years later became a judge there. In 1933, Kreyssig was pressured to join the Nazi party, but refused, citing his need for judicial independence. However, in 1934, he joined the Confessing Church and in 1935, was elected Praeses at the synod of the Confessing Church in Saxony. He was still able to work in his profession and in 1937, he was transferred to Brandenburg an der Havel to the lower district court.Anton Legerer. \\"Preparing the Ground for Constitutionalization through Reconciliation Work\\" German Law Journal excerpt.

He bought an estate in nearby Havelsee, where he practiced biodynamic farming. A preliminary investigation prompted by Kreyssig's church activities was made against him, but no action was taken. After the number of death certificates of his wards began to accumulate on his desk, he began to suspect the deaths were connected to the \\"mercy killing\\" that had begun.Document signed by Hitler authorizing Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler to begin the mercy killings. Harvard Law School Library, Nuremberg Trials Project. Retrieved March 14, 2010. He reported his suspicions in a letter to Minister of Justice Franz G√ºrtner, dated July 8, 1940. He pilloried the Nazis' Action T4 euthanasia program. He also addressed the disenfranchisement of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps, making all his arguments on firm legal grounds.Ernst Klee. The Encyclopedia of the Third Persons Reich. Fischer Taschenbuch (2005) p. 340 Kreyssig then filed a charge against Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler for murder. He filed an injunction against the institutions in which he had housed his wards, prohibiting them from transferring the wards without his consent.Law's Heroes University of Missouri at Kansas City, Law Department, faculty projects. Retrieved March 15, 2010 On 13 November 1940 Kreyssig was summoned by G√ºrtner, who laid before Kreyssig Hitler's personal letter that had started the euthanasia program and which constituted the sole legal basis for it. Kreyssig replied, \\"The F√ºhrer's word does not create a right,\\" clearly signifying that he did not recognize this as a legal right. G√ºrtner then told Kreyssig, \\"If you cannot recognise the will of the F√ºhrer as a source of law, then you cannot remain a judge.\\" In December 1940, Kreyssig was suspended. Efforts by the Gestapo to send him to a concentration camp failed. Two years later, in March 1942, Hitler forced Kreyssig to retire. Kreyssig then devoted himself to organic farming and church work. He also hid two Jewish women on his property until the end of the war.  After 1945  After the end of National Socialism, Kreyssig came to be appreciated as a Widerstandsk√§mpfer. However, in the Soviet occupation zone after the war, as an alleged Prussian Junker he lost part of his estate. Feeling that the rule of law in the Soviet occupation zone was insufficient, Kreyssig decided against resuming his career as a judge. Instead, he accepted an offer from Bishop Otto Dibelius and in 1945, became the consistorial president of the Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony in Magdeburg. In 1947, he became Praeses of the Synod of the church province, an office he held until 1964. In December 1950 the general synod of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union elected him its praeses, an office he held until 1970. In 1952, he briefly headed the church chancellery of that Church. Between 1949 and 1961, he was a council member of the Evangelical Church in Germany, the Protestant umbrella in Germany, and from 1949 to 1958, he was also eastern vice president of the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag. Spiritually, he was at home in the Evangelische Michaelsbruderschaft. Kreyssig's views were controversial. He espoused an ecumenism of Christians, but one that would also include Judaism. Kreyssig turned against the Wiederbewaffnung and rejected the division of Germany into two countries. Kreyssig established church institutions and programs, such as the Protestant Academy of the Church Province of Saxony, and a hotline. He founded the Aktionsgemeinschaft f√ºr die Hungernden, a communal action to combat hunger, which was a precursor of the NGO Action for World Solidarity. His most significant work, however, was the founding of the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace. Kreyssig called for the founding of this action in 1958, saying that young Germans should go to former enemy countries and to Israel to ask for forgiveness and show, by volunteering to do good deeds to atone for the bombing and crimes of World War II, to show signs of atonement, to work toward reconciliation, and for peace. Today, thousands of Germans have volunteered in numerous countries through this organization.Ruth Rovner. \\"Emissaries of Good Will ‚Äî Young Germans Participate in a Unique Project\\" \\"German Life\\" Retrieved March 15, 2010 The first projects were in Norway, the Netherlands, Great Britain, France and Greece. With the construction of the Berlin Wall, Kreyssig was cut off from the international activities of his organization. As a result, he gave up running the organization and devoted himself to building a version of the organization in the German Democratic Republic. One of the first projects of this initiative was to rebuild two destroyed churches in Magdeburg. In 1971, Kreyssig and his wife moved to West Berlin. He lived in a nursing home from 1977 in Bergisch Gladbach until his death in 1986.  Legacy and memorials  To this day, Kreyssig is known as the only judge who tried to stop the systematic murders conducted under the Nazis' T4 program. The cities of Fl√∂ha, Brandenburg an der Havel, Magdeburg, Karlsruhe and Bergisch Gladbach each have a street named after him. In Fl√∂ha, there is a F√∂rderschule and in Lehnin, a senior care center that bear his name. The Lothar Kreyssig Peace Prize has been awarded every two years since 1999 by the Lothar Kreyssig Foundation in Magdeburg. On the anniversary of his 100th birthday, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the Oberlandesgericht (Superior Regional Court) in Brandenburg an der Havel. The former lower district court site, now the location of the Brandenburg Generalstaatsanwaltschaft (Attorney General), outside, has two memorial stelae and inside, a plaque with an inscription by Kreyssig's biographer, Konrad Wei√ü. The Brandenburg Association of Jurists donated the plaque on 5 May 2008 to commemorate Kreyssig's Appeal to found the Action for Reconciliation on the 50th anniversary of its introduction. On 22 October 2006 the Federal Ministry of Justice held a memorial, sponsored by Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Kreyssig's death. On 5 July 2008 a memorial was unveiled at Hohenferchesar, his residence from 1937 to 1972. Lothar and Johanna Kreyssig were recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 2016.

The memoir relates how Riley and his crew were captured in Africa after being shipwrecked in 1815. Riley was the Captain of the American merchant ship . He led his crew through the Sahara Desert after they were shipwrecked off the coast of Western Sahara in August 1815. The book was published in 1817 and was originally titled Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig Commerce by the \\"Late Master and Supercargo\\" James Riley, modernly republished as Sufferings in Africa, and comes down to us today as a startling switch on the usual master- slave relationship. This true story describes how they came to be shipwrecked, and their travails in the Sahara Desert. Lost in this unknown world, Captain Riley felt responsible for his crew and their safety. He told of the events leading to their capture by marauding Sahrawi natives who kept them as slaves. Horribly mistreated, they were beaten, sun-burnt, starved, and forced to drink their own and camel urine. A slave would be worked until close to death, and then either traded or killed. Plot summary Upon landing in the ship's leaky boat, Riley and his crew began to make repairs to return to the ship, rather than face a desert rescue. The repairs were incomplete when a native armed with a spear arrived and helped himself to their meager supplies. After filling up his arms with what he could carry off, he left and returned with two others also carrying spears. Riley stayed back to distract the Arabs and give his men a chance to escape in the loaded and unfinished boat. They made it, but without Riley, who offered his captors money in exchange for his life. With their agreement, crew member Antonio Michele swam to shore to pay them, at which point Riley ran out into the water to join his men. After Riley was safe in the boat, all he could do was watch while an Arab stabbed Michele in the stomach and dragged his body away, which caused Riley tremendous feelings of guilt. As the ship, still aground, was unusable, unable to reach what are now the islands of Cape Verde, the crew decided to sail to the South while hoping for rescue, which did not come. After nine days, out of food and water, they returned to the shore at an isolated beach further south, with the realization that they would probably be killed just as quickly as Michele. They reached the shore, which was surrounded by high cliffs. Riley told his men to begin digging for water. He climbed to the top of the cliffs and found himself staring at the edge of a vast expanse of flat desert. His crew joined him, and together they started to walk inland hoping for rescue by a friendly tribe. But soon they were without hope, enduring heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. Out of food and water, Riley resolved that they should either accept death or offer themselves as slaves to the first tribe they encountered, which is exactly what happened. A large gathering of men and camels appeared on the horizon, and the crew approached them. The tribe started to fight among themselves, to determine who would become the slave-owners. Riley's crew became separated when they were taken as slaves by different groups, which then went their own ways. Riley recounts in his memoirs the terrifying days spent in servitude. After a while, he learned some of the language and was able to communicate in a rudimentary way. One day during his captivity some Arabs arrived seeking a trade with his master. Riley asked two of them, Sidi Hamet and his brother, if they would buy him and his fellow shipmates and bring them to the closest city - which was Mogador (now Essaouira) - hundreds of miles away to the north. Hamet was moved by Riley's desire to save his friends and agreed to buy them if Riley would pay him with cash and a gun when they arrived at the city. Riley promised that he had a friend there who would pay him upon their safe arrival, which was totally untrue, for Riley knew nobody. Hamet promised to slit his throat if he were lying. When the time came for Riley to write the note, he was terrified. How could he write a note to a perfect stranger, begging him for several hundred dollars? He had no choice. In the note he explained who he was and described his situation. Traveling through the desert caused all to suffer - master and slave alike. There was little food for the already starving American men, and little water for everyone. Amazingly, they traveled the distance to the city - several hundred miles, constantly in fear of marauding hunter tribes. They were especially in fear of a father-in-law of one of the brothers, who was out to settle a dispute. Eventually they arrived at the outskirts, and Hamet took the note, which was addressed to the town's consul, into town. Hamet met a young man in the city, who, it turns out, worked as an assistant to a British merchant who also acted as a kind of consul and agent. Hamet told this man about his \\"friend\\" and gave him the note. This consul, William Willshire, impressed by the sincerity of the note, agreed to pay. Willshire rode out in a group to meet the men as they waited outside the city, and Willshire greeted Riley with hugs and tears. Riley sent his remaining men home to America but stayed behind for just a few days. Seti Hamet, his former master, promised to return to the desert to look for Riley's missing crew members. Riley went back to America and was reunited with his wife and their five children in Connecticut. Two of the missing men were later returned to the States, and Riley heard of two Arabs who were stoned to death out in the desert by marauders. He was convinced they were his former master, trying to keep his word, together with his brother. Reception Abraham Lincoln, who later became president of the United States, listed Sufferings in Africa, as one of the three most influential works that shaped his political ideology, particularly his views on slavery. The others were the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Sequel In 1851, eleven years after James Riley's death at sea, G. Brewster published the Sequel to Riley's Narrative: Being a Sketch of Interesting Incidents in the Life, Voyages and Travels of Capt. James Riley, from the Period of His Return to His Native Land, After His Shipwreck, Captivity and Sufferings Among the Arabs of the Desert, as Related in His Narrative, Until His Death.

They traditionally lived in the Lemhi River Valley and along the upper Salmon River in Idaho. Bands were very fluid and nomadic, and they often interacted with and intermarried other bands of Shoshone and other tribes, such as the Bannock.Murphy and Murphy, 288 Today most of them are enrolled in the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho. Traditional culture The Akaitikka are Numic speakers, speaking the Shoshone language.Murphy and Murphy, 287 Fishing is an important source of food, and salmon, and trout were staples. Gooseberries and camas root, Camassia quamash are traditional vegetable foods for the Lemhi Shoshone.Murphy and Murphy, 285 In the 19th century, buffalo hunting provided meat, furs, hides, and other materials.Murphy and Murphy, 286 History During the 19th century, the Lemhi Shoshone were allied with the Flatheads and enemies of the Blackfeet. The Lewis and Clark Expedition encountered the Lemhi at the Three Forks of the Missouri River in 1805. In the 1860s, Indian agents estimated the Lemhi population, which included Shoshone, Bannock, and Tukudeka (Sheepeaters), to be 1,200.Murphy and Murphy, 289 Tendoy was a prominent Lemhi chief in the mid-19th century. He was half-Shoshone and half-Bannock. He became the Lemhi's leading chief in 1863 after Tio-van-du-ah was killed in Bannock County, Idaho. The Lemhi Reservation, located along the Lemhi River, west of the Bitterroot Range and north of the Lemhi Range was created in 1875 and terminated in 1907. Most of the residents were moved to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. Others remain near Salmon, Idaho.

The following season, he switched codes, joining professional rugby league club Huddersfield, before ending his league career with Halifax (Heritage ‚Ññ 601). Rugby union Reid came to note as a rugby player when he represented Garryowen in the 1940s; playing his first game against University College, Galway. In 1947 he won his first international cap, when he was selected to face Australia on their 1947‚Äì48 tour. The Irish team started the match with eight new caps, and Reid was partnered with Kevin Joseph Quinn at centre, the only player with any past international experience in the three-quarter positions. Australia were far too strong for Ireland, beating them 16‚Äì3. Despite the loss, the Irish selectors kept faith with Reid and he returned into the Ireland team for the opening game of the 1948 Five Nations Championship. After the defeat by Australia there was little to suggest the Irish would have a successful season, though the campaign started well with a victory over France in Paris. It was a good game for Reid, as he also scored his first and only international points, running the ball under the posts after a tactical line-out. The following game saw Karl Mullen appointed Ireland team captain, and the tactical changes he brought to the team turned the squad into a far superior unit. Although Ireland did not possess the talent of other teams, as a unit they began to play a more defensive and tight game, taking their chances wisely. The new tactical play gave Ireland victory over England in a close game at Twickenham. The last two games of the Championship were both played at home, the first a victory over Scotland at Lansdowne Road, for which Reid was omitted. The Scottish victory gave Ireland the Championship title, but the team had not won a Triple Crown title since 1899. A victory over Wales would give Ireland the Triple Crown. Reid was reinstated back into the team for the Wales encounter, this time played at Ravenhill.

Early life  Htein Lin was born in Mezaligon, Sagaing Region in Burma. From 1985, he studied for a Bachelor of Law (LLB) degree at Yangon University. Together with other students, he was expelled in 1988 for protesting about the lack of investigation into the death of another student. Following involvement with protests, Htein Lin, together with other activists, withdrew to camps on the border with India. Here he became a member of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), opposed to the Burmese military regime. During this period, he studied with the artist Sitt Nyein Aye from Mandalay, learning about western artists such as Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. He used his skills to add illustrations the publications of the ABSDF. He was involved with internal conflicts within the ABSDF in 1991 and was imprisoned. In 1993, Htein Lin continued his law degree, which he completed in 1994.  Artistic career Instead of working in the legal profession, Htein Lin became an artist and also an actor in comic films (as \\"Htein Htein\\") in the mid 1990s. He led the way with modern Burmese performance art. His artistic performances included The Little Worm in the Ear, in Yangon, and Guitarist in 1996. Htein Lin spent 6¬Ω years as a political prisoner in Burma from 1998-2004.Htein Lin , Free Zarganar. He continued to perform for fellow inmates in prison. Officially, he was not permitted to paint while imprisoned. However, he managed to produce several hundred paintings secretly, using white cotton prison uniforms, as well as about a thousand drawings. He bribed the prison guards to smuggle paint to him, but it was too dangerous to have a paintbrush in his cell. Instead, he used various objects that were available to him, including cigarette lighters, pieces of glass, plates, nets, razor blades, syringes, or simply his fingers and hands. He used a monoprint technique. After his release from prison in 2004, he returned to art and performance. His May 2005 Rangoon street performance entitled Mobile Art Gallery/Mobile Market meant he was interrogated by the authorities again. He was introduced in 2005 to the British Ambassador in Yangon, Victoria Bowman, who took receipt of his prison paintings and ensured their preservation by loaning them to the Burma Archives Project at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.Htein Lin Papers, International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1988‚Äì2006. He later married Victoria Bowman and they moved to live in London for seven years. During his time in the UK, Htein Lin undertook performance art in Trafalgar Square, central London, on 1 June 2008.Htein Lin's performance in Trafalgar Sq 1/6/08, Flickr. He also had exhibitions and performed in Finland, France, Norway, Thailand, Czech Republic and the United States of America. In addition, he has performed at the 2007 Venice Biennale and at festivals in Finland, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. His performances draw on his artistic life as well as aiming to raise awareness of the Burmese political situation. Htein Lin has continued to use the monoprint technique in his subsequent paintings. These draw on his Theravada Buddhist faith, Burmese symbols and traditions, his early experience as a comedian in \\"anyeint\\" satirical performances, and events such as Cyclone Nargis and the Saffron Revolution. In 2013, Htein Lin returned to live in Rangoon, and commenced his project A Show of Hands Project.. In 2014 he returned one week in prison to train prisoners to Vipassana meditation and monoprint painting techniques .

Established in the 16th century in part of a former monastery and cottage in the centre of Old Shoreham, opposite the village's former tollbridge, it was extended in the 19th century and became central to life in the old village. Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Rizpah is based on events at the inn in the 19th century which resulted in the capture and execution of some robbers. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Old Shoreham developed on the east bank of the River Adur, just north of the estuary on the English Channel in the Saxon period; longstanding claims that it was the site (Cymenshore) of the first King of the South Saxons √Ülle's arrival in 477 have been disproved. The village was successful: a large church, dedicated to St Nicolas, was founded in about 900 and extended in 1140, and there were 76 residents at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086. A tollbridge to the west bank of the Adur at Lancing was built in 1782. This, and the diversion of the road eastwards to the seaside resort of Brighton, caused the focus of the village to move westwards, towards the river and the west end of the old village street. A cottage, apparently part of a former monastery, stood on the old road near the tollbridge. It was converted into an inn under the sign of the Red Lion. The building was extended and lengthened to the north and south later in the 18th century and in the 19th century. It developed trade as a coaching inn serving the roads towards Brighton (eastwards) and Steyning (northwards, along the bank of the river). In the 1920s, the main road to Brighton was realigned again: thereafter it ran immediately south of the inn. The inn was central to a locally famous tragedy which gained wider recognition when Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote a poem, Rizpah, based on it. On 1 November 1792, the driver of the local mail coach had to deliver a letter containing half a sovereign (approximate value ¬£ as of ) on his usual route between Brighton and Shoreham. At Hove he was robbed by two Shoreham men, one of whom went on to the Red Lion to meet drinking companions. He was heard discussing the crime by Phoebe Hessel, a well-known Brighton resident who frequented the inn. She reported him to the local parish constable, who arrested both men. The robbery had involved no violence, but the men were sentenced to death at Horsham Assizes: they were tied to horses and sent there accompanied by a military and police escort. On 26 April 1793 a large crowd watched as they were hanged at the place where they robbed the mail coach; their bodies were dressed and left to rot on the gibbet. The younger man's mother was so distraught that she travelled every night to Hove to collect the decaying bones and flesh, and eventually interred them in the graveyard at St Nicolas' Church. Another bizarre event involving a dead robber occurred at the inn in the 1850s. A man burgled several houses in Shoreham, but when he broke into Buckingham House (an 18th-century mansion with a history dating back to the mid-17th century or earlier) he was shot dead. Nobody could identify him, so his body was placed in a glass-topped coffin and left at the inn in case any visitors recognised his face. Hundreds of people travelled to Shoreham to inspect the coffin, but the man was eventually identified by his dog, which appeared at the inn, saw the man's face and sat by the body, refusing to leave it. The robber was identified as John O'Hara and was buried at St Nicolas' Church. A tradition called \\"The Bushel\\"‚Äîa drinking custom held on New Year's Day‚Äîlasted for much of the 19th century at the Red Lion: it was last documented in 1883. A bushel of beer was covered with greenery and flowers so that when the beer was poured in, the head erupted in a cauliflower shape. The beer was then doled out to all comers, and the \\"chairman\\" in charge of the festivities was then allowed to drink from the bushel. The Red Lion Inn was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 29 September 1972. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 119 Grade II listed buildings, and 106 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Adur. Architecture The building is mostly 18th-century, although 16th-century origins have been claimed. It is a low- set, long building in three parts: the central section is the original cottage, and 18th- and 19th-century additions stand to the left (north) and right (south). The exterior walls are plaster-coated, and the roofs are laid with tiles of Horsham stone. The building is roughly L-shaped, with a projecting wing at the north end. Only the centre section is higher than one storey, and even it does not reach a full two-storey height. Furthermore, the building is now set below the level of the road, which has been raised since its origins as a village track. The centre section has a three casement window range, and there are three sashes elsewhere (two on the fa√ßade of the southward extension and one in the cross-wing to the north). The substantial entrance door is set in a timbered porch; both were added in the 20th century.

They are nicknamed Los Colibr√≠es (Hummingbirds). Their colors were a variation of blue and white. Their uniform color was a blue and white shirt that is split down the middle. Their greatest achievements were in the early 2000s when they played in the top division. The club was founded in 2002 when Atl√©tico Celaya was moved to Morelos where they changed the club's colors and badge. There were problems with the club from the beginning when club Zacatepec protested with the city claiming that they did not want another club in the city that played in a higher division than they did. Zacatepec at the time played in the second division. Soon after, there were problems with their stadium, which was built between a brook a rocky area. Because of this, the federation implied that fans might use the rocks as weapons, but FIFA approved the use of the stadium almost at the ultimate hour. The club's first matches were surprisingly good, winning the first 3 out of 4 matches; including a 3-0 home victory against Tecos UAG and a 1-3 away victory at Pumas UNAM, but soon after, controversy arose with high attrition when players and coaches alike claimed that their monthly paycheques had no funds/bounce. In 2003 their stadium was finally approved by the federation and played there from 2002's preseason to 2003. Financial problems arose after they'd found out that their fundless checks wouldn't cover the cost of training, which led to an immediate decline in onfield performance. Such was the issue that training sessions were often held in the backyard of Claudio Pinto da Silva, who was the team's top goalscorer. After a string of poor results, head coach/manager Sergio Rubio, who had been there since week one, was released from his contract, placing Croat national Zlatko Petricevic as the interim coach/manager. One notable game, against America, on week 15 at the Estadio Azteca in front of what was basically an empty stadium, was memorable in that during the team photo, they had revealed white shirts under their uniforms with the words 'basta de mentiras' (which is English for 'stop the lies'), calling out Jorge Rodriguez Marie on their financial problems. They would go on to lose 2-0 in the Estadio Azteca. This would be Sergio Rubio's last match in charge of the squad, after getting re-hired to replace Zlatko Petricevic. Relegation fight With a poor tournament, the club found itself fighting neck and neck with Chiapas which was also playing its first year in the Primera Divisi√≥n de M√©xico. On week 17, the final week of regular season, Colibries had a chance to avoid relegation with a victory over Cruz Azul but unfortunately, the club walked away with a 0‚Äì0 result, and Chiapas' last minute win over Tecos sealed their fate. After the Spring/Clausura 2003 season, they were relegated, placing them in Primera A the following season. Soon after, the club was seized by FMF and the assets were sold to the city of Tijuana.

Life William Little Lee was born February 25, 1821 in Sandy Hill, New York. His father was Colonel Stephen Lee (1773‚Äì1856) and mother was Mary Little (1795‚Äì1881). He graduated from Norwich University in 1842. He taught in a military school established by Alden Partridge in Portsmouth, Virginia, for one year, and then graduated from Harvard Law School. One of his teachers at Harvard was Joseph Story, who was sitting on the Supreme Court of the United States at the time. He practiced law in Troy, New York, but convinced his boyhood friend Charles Reed Bishop to travel with him to the Oregon Territory in February 1846 on the ship Henry. The ship was damaged while passing around Cape Horn, and needed to stop at the Hawaiian Islands for provisions and repairs on October 12. Lee was only the second person in Hawaii with any western-style law training. John Ricord had arrived just two years earlier, and was acting as Attorney General. Ricord convinced Lee to stay, and Bishop was given the job of sorting out the defunct Ladd & Co. which was also the center of a long-lasting legal dispute. A related land dispute by Richard Charlton had caused a British military occupation a few years earlier called the Paulet Affair which was still being sorted out. On December 1, 1846 he was appointed judge of the island of Oahu, and served on the Privy Council of King Kamehameha III for the rest of his life. Ricord left in 1847 and Lee had to finish drafting legislation to formalize the court system. Called the \\"third organic act\\" or \\"act to Organize the Judiciary Department\\" it was passed September 7, 1847 activated January 10, 1848. Starting in 1847 he became a member of a commission to quiet land titles that led to legislation known as the Great Mahele which formalized fee simple ownership of real estate. On January 16, 1848 he was named Chief Justice of the Superior Court. On March 11, 1849 he married Catherine Newton (c. 1819‚Äì1894), and became a boarder in Washington Place with John Owen Dominis and Dominis' mother. Lee had proposed by letter, and they were married aboard the Leland by Rev. Samuel C. Damon. Lee on left, with Charles Reed Bishop in 1846 On August 12, 1849, French admiral Louis Tromelin staged a French Invasion of Honolulu. On August 28 Lee and chief government minister Gerrit P. Judd went aboard the French ship for an attempted peace conference. However, Tromelin continued to sack the city before sailing off with the king's yacht and other plunder. Judd and two young princes were sent to Europe to negotiate treaties, stopping in the United States on the way. Judd advocated annexation by the United States to protect against further actions by British and French. Lee was more in favor of a simple treaty of Reciprocity. Former Scottish physician, now Foreign Minister Robert Crichton Wyllie agreed, and former Hawaiian newspaper publisher James Jackson Jarves negotiated a treaty with John M. Clayton signed on December 20, 1849. In 1851 Lee was elected to the House of Representatives in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Lee helped draft the 1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii and a judiciary bill to implement its provisions. Lorrin Andrews and John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ became associate justices and Lee chief justice of what was now called the Supreme Court. On December 15, 1854 Kamehameha III died; his nephew took the throne as Kamehameha IV. On January 15, 1855 Lee was named Chancellor, and in March 1855 to 1856 served as an envoy to the United States where he traveled for medical advice. Lee and his wife first went to San Francisco where he met with California's first Senator William M. Gwin. On July 10, 1855 they arrived in Washington, D.C. and he met wirh William L. Marcy and then President Franklin Pierce. Marcy and Lee agreed on terms on July 20, 1855. He also met with representatives of other governments, but could not get them to sign on to a multi-party treaty. In September he returned to Hawaii. However, the treaty never went into effect, because it was never ratified by the Senate. His health declined, and he returned to Honolulu. He had probably been suffering from tuberculosis. After his death May 28, 1857 fellow American Elisha Hunt Allen became Chief Justice, who would also try to push the treaty through. His widow Catherine Newton traveled back to New York and in 1861 married Edward L. Youmans, the founder of Popular Science. She used income from the sugarcane plantation to help support the magazine in its early years.

The history of Durham University spans over 180 years since it was founded by Act of Parliament. King William IV granted Royal Assent to the Act on 4 July 1832, and granted the university a Royal Charter on 1 June 1837, incorporating it and confirming its constitution. The university awarded its first degrees on 8 June 1837. It claims to be the third-oldest university in England (a claim also made by UCL and the University of London) and is, according to the European University Association's A History of the University in Europe, one of the oldest hundred universities in continuous operation in Europe. ‚Äì By the chronological list on pp 673‚Äì691, Durham was the eighth of these new foundations. Durham University owns (as of 2006) a 227.8-hectare (563 acres) estate which includes a UNESCO world heritage site, one ancient monument (the Maiden Castle earthworks), five grade-one listed buildings and 68 Grade II listed buildings along with 44.9 ha (111 acres) of woodland. The university has, since 1992, been divided into two campuses: Durham City and Queen's Campus, Stockton-on-Tees. Origins Durham Castle houses University College, making it the oldest inhabited university building in the world.Castle JCR King William IV who granted Durham University its Royal Charter in 1837 The direct involvement of Durham Cathedral with higher education dates back to the foundation c. 1286 of Durham Hall at Oxford, where the monks of Durham Abbey could go to study at the University of Oxford. This was endowed by Bishop Thomas Hatfield of Durham c. 1380 to become Durham College, Oxford, consisting of eight monks (one of whom served as Warden) and eight secular scholars. This college remained a cell of Durham Abbey rather than becoming an independent foundation. At the Reformation in 1540 it was dissolved and its revenues passed to the new dean and chapter of the reformed Durham Cathedral. In 1541, Henry VIII proposed founding a northern University in Durham, but the plans were scaled down from a college with a provost and professors of divinity, Greek, Hebrew and medicine to a grammar school with a headmaster and an assistant master paid from Cathedral funds. There was a brief attempt to continue the college in Oxford as a secular foundation, but this lasted less than a year. The site was sold to Sir Thomas Pope in 1555 and used to found Trinity College, Oxford. The next attempt to establish a university in Durham was under Oliver Cromwell. In 1649 the cathedrals of England were dissolved by Act of Parliament, leaving Durham Castle (the Bishop's palace), the cathedral and the college (the cathedral close) unoccupied. A number of petitions were presented to Cromwell, who in 1657 issued letters patent incorporating Durham College. Philip Hunton was nominated as the provost, along with two preachers, four professors, four tutors, and four schoolmasters. The college was granted an endowment of lands formerly belonging to the cathedral, along with the buildings of the college and the cathedral library. However, the letters patent of 1657 did not give the college the powers of a university. A further petition was made to Cromwell in 1658, but nothing was done before he died. Oxford and Cambridge then petitioned his successor, Richard Cromwell, in 1659 against any grant of university powers to the Durham college. The college was also opposed by George Fox and other Quakers as being an institute designed to prepare ministers. According to Fowler, \\"on April 22 [Richard Cromwell] directed that a grant which had been drawn up to make the College a University should not be sealed until further order\\". The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 saw the cathedral chapter re-established and Durham College closed. However, the cause of education was not wholly forgotten, for Bishop John Cosin established his library on Palace Green a few years later, in 1669. In the first half of the 19th century, many elements came together. There was increasing interest in the theological training of the clergy, leading to the establishment of the private St Bees Theological College in west Cumberland in 1816 and St David's College, Lampeter in Wales in 1822 by Bishop Thomas Burgess, who was a prebendary of Durham. Burgess was succeeded as Bishop of St David's in 1825 by John Banks Jenkinson, who became Dean of Durham (in addition to his bishopric) in 1827. The secular University College London (UCL) was established in 1826: it was then operating under the name of London University, which had led to the foundation of the Anglican King's College London in 1829. In 1831 UCL had, like Cromwell's Durham College, had its attempt to gain University status blocked by Oxford and Cambridge, on the grounds that it wanted to offer degrees to people who were not members of the established church. A church university could not be opposed on these grounds, and schemes were drawn up in the late 1820s and 1830s for universities in York and Bath, both of which failed for lack of money. There were also threats that the Whig government elected in 1830 would seek to remove some of the wealth of the Church of England ‚Äì of which Durham was one of the richest cathedrals ‚Äì and that a UCL-like secular college would be established in Newcastle, as proposed by Thomas Greenhow in 1831 (this led to the foundation of the Newcastle upon Tyne School of Medicine and Surgery in 1834). In summer 1831 the idea of founding a university at Durham was revived by Charles Thorp, a prebendary of Durham and domestic chaplain to Earl Grey, the prime minister (and from December 1831 Archdeacon of Durham). On 28 September the Chapter passed an Act officially founding \\"an academical institution\\" and by the end of the year this was being advertised as the University of Durham. In 1832 William van Mildert, the Bishop of Durham, introduced a bill in Parliament entitled \\"an Act to enable the Dean and Chapter of Durham to appropriate part of the property of their church to the establishment of a University in connection therewith\\". The two main effects of this bill were: (1) to establish a university as an eleemosynary (charitable) trust under the control of the Dean and Chapter of Durham as governors and trustees, and the Bishop of Durham as Visitor; (2) to allow part of the property of the cathedral to be used to support this university. The bill was passed with the support of Earl Grey's government, and received Royal Assent on 4 July 1832, which is taken as the date of the university's foundation.  Early years, 1832‚Äì1846=The opening of the university The university was intended from the start to be collegiate, and the foundation college was University College. This was originally accommodated in the former Archdeacon's Inn, renamed University House (now Cosin's Hall). After the passing of the Act, a year was spent setting up the university and recruiting staff. The library was established in January 1833 by a donation of 160 volumes from Van Mildert, with the Bishop's librarian, Rev. Patrick George, being named the university's first librarian. The library was housed in a gallery of Cosin's Library on Palace Green. On 20 July the opening of the university in Michaelmas Term 1833 was announced, along with an almost complete list of staff. The university opened on 28 October 1833 with 19 \\"scholars\\" and 18 \\"students\\" on the Bachelor of Arts course and 5 students on the theology licence course. The university was the first in England to introduce matriculation examinations, although these had been in use at the University of St Andrews and Marischal College, Aberdeen since the 1820s; the first student to be matriculated was John Cundill. Shortly after the first students arrived, the \\"first calendar\\" was published, advertising the institution as the \\"University of Durham founded by Act of Chapter with the Consent of the Bishop of Durham 28 September 1831. Constituted a University by Act of Parliament 2nd and 3rd William IV., Sess. 1831-2.\\" The university had three professors (all Anglican clergymen) at its opening: Hugh James Rose (Divinity and Ecclesiastical History), Henry Jenkyns (Greek and Classical Literature) and John Carr (Mathematics). This reflected the two BA honours courses in classics and mathematics (following Oxford and Cambridge) and the course in theology, leading to the Licence in Theology (LTh). There were also readers in law (William Gray), medicine (William Cooke), history (Thomas Greenwood), natural philosophy (Charles Thomas Whitley) and moral philosophy (J. Miller), and lecturers in Modern languages (James Hamilton), and chemistry and mineralogy (James Finlay Weir Johnston, FRSE). Unlike at Oxford and Cambridge, where the teaching was carried out by the colleges, the professors at Durham were expected to \\"have the charge of the studies in their respective departments and work as at Glasgow and the foreign Universities, and as they did at Oxford in old times\\". Unfortunately, Carr died suddenly on 30 October, only two days after the university opened. The university went into mourning for fourteen days. George, the librarian, died on 13 January 1834, Whitley taking over that role in addition to his readership. Rose was also plagued by ill health and left in March. He became the second principal of King's College London in 1836 but again only lasted around six months before ill health forced him from the post; he died in 1838 aged 43. After he left Durham, his brother, Henry John Rose, filled in for the rest of the academic year, before returning to his fellowship at Cambridge. Jenkyns took over as acting professor of divinity, while remaining professor of Greek until 1839, when he was appointed professor of Greek permanently and made a canon of the cathedral. Temple Chevallier came to Durham in 1834 to assist Jenkyns with the teaching of theology and Hebrew, and was appointed professor of mathematics, reader in Hebrew and Registrar to the university in 1835. In early 1834, Thorp wrote to the bishops of the Church of England asking if they would accept holders of Durham degrees for ordination alongside those from Oxford and Cambridge. The answers were mostly positive, with only two bishops refusing: George Murray (bishop of Rochester) and Henry Phillpotts (bishop of Exeter and a canon of Durham Cathedral). At the end of the 1833‚Äì34 academic year, George Selby Thomson became the first recipient of the LTh, which was available with only one year's study for those with degrees from Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin or Durham (as opposed to three years' study for non- graduates). Thomson had gained his BA at Jesus College, Cambridge and took his MA in June 1834. There was originally an intention to offer a medical course similar to those at the London colleges, leading to the Licence of the Society of Apothecaries. However, there was insufficient demand to sustain the course, particularly after the opening of the medical school in Newcastle (1834), and lectures in medicine stopped after 1836. In March 1834, Thorp received a letter from John Burder, the Bishop's London secretary, checking whether the proceedings regarding the university in Chapter were in writing under their common seal and with the Bishop's signature, Following this, an Act of Chapter on 4 April 1834 resolved \\"that the College established by Act of Chapter, 28th September 1831, be constituted a University\\". On 9 May 1835 the university took legal advice on the extent of its powers under the 1832 act, and in particular whether it could grant degrees. It was then announced on 13 June 1835 that the university would confer degrees and that a fundamental statute would be drawn up for the university. This fundamental statute was passed by the dean and chapter on 20 June 1835; it established the University Senate and Convocation, explicitly allowed the university to grant degrees (stating \\"that the degrees in the various faculties shall be conferred by the Warden in Convocation\\"), limited degrees to members of the established church, and gave the Senate (subject to the approval of Convocation) the right to make further regulations. The statement that the university would grant degrees and the publication of the statutes led to a letter to the York Herald accusing the university of deceit in claiming the right to offer degrees without actually possessing that right, and claiming that students had been transferred to Oxford because \\"when the time for degrees grew near, not a degree could the Durhamites confer\\". A response in the Durham Advertiser from \\"Dunelmensis\\" pointed out that \\"[t]he time for conferring degrees has not yet arrived\\" and that therefore the supposed lack of any right to confer degrees was purely the opinion of the writer of the original letter, without any evidence to back it up. The first Convocation was held on 4 March 1836 to approve the regulations for the university, a second meeting the following week approved the appointment of examiners. The 1836 Convocation consisted of 84 graduates (doctors or MAs) of Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin who had become members of the University of Durham, including John Keble and John Henry Newman. The first final degree examinations were held in Easter term, 1836, although following the practice of Oxford at the time the students would not receive their degrees for another year. The examinations in 1836 saw Durham introduce the use of external examiners to ensure comparability of its degrees with those of Oxford and Cambridge. This marked the start of the system of external examination that spread throughout British higher education and is still used today. John Cundill became the first Durham student to gain first class honours, in mathematics, although he missed out on a double first, taking second class honours in classics. On 21 February 1836, Van Mildert died. The funding for the university was not yet fully established ‚Äì Van Mildert had been supporting it with ¬£2,000 a year from his own income and had been working to get prebendal stalls attached to the professorships of divinity and classics and to the wardenship, but this was in the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and not yet decided. He had also allowed the university the use of Durham Castle, but this again was not yet settled. Thirdly, the Royal Charter to incorporate the university was not yet granted. There was also a fear that the Whig government, now under Lord Melbourne, would appoint a liberal bishop who might not support the idea of the exclusively Anglican University. The new bishop was named as Edward Maltby, a liberal and supporter of UCL who had read the prayer at the laying of its foundation stone (and, from its foundation in November 1836, a senator of the University of London). Before he was installed, the petition for the Royal Charter was submitted. On the legal advice of Sir Charles Wetherell, it contained no explicit mention of degree awarding powers, only incorporation and the right to hold property. However, the charter was delayed by Lord Russell, the home secretary, after the fee had been paid for sealing the charter, due to Durham degrees not being open to non-Anglicans. With the time set for the conferring of degrees approaching, there were fears that, while the university believed it had the power to grant degrees under the 1832 act, objections would be made and the public perception of the degrees would be affected. Nevertheless, the intention was to grant degrees whether or not the charter was sealed in time. The Royal Charter In the event, Maltby \\"heartily entered into the scheme for the Durham University\\", and with his support the university's Royal Charter was granted on 1 June 1837 by William IV, incorporating \\"The Warden, Masters and Scholars of the University of Durham\\". While, following Wetherell's advice, this did not include explicit degree awarding powers, it stated that the fundamental statute passed by the dean and chapter (as governors of the university) in 1835 was \\"by virtue, and in pursuance of the trusts and powers in the said Act of Parliament, and of every other power enabling them in that behalf\\" and also that the university \\"shall have and enjoy all the property, rights, and privileges which are assured by the said Act [the University of Durham Act 1832] to the university therein contemplated and authorised; or are incident to a University established by our Royal Charter\\". The charter did not create a new institution but rather confirmed Durham's status as a university. The first students graduated a week after the grant of the charter, on 8 June 1837. At the same congregation the charter was accepted and the original seal of the university adopted (a St Cuthbert's cross in a circle, the coat of arms not then having been granted). The first honorary degree was awarded the Earl Grey in 1838. The examination period of 1837 saw the first examinations for the MA. This was a break with the tradition of the ancient universities, where the Oxbridge MA had come to be awarded on payment of a fee to all BAs of the required standing. Durham, by contrast, required a further year of study and the passing of an examination. On 19 July 1837, Queen Victoria, by an order of the Queen-in-Council, granted the use of Durham Castle, previously a palace of the Bishop of Durham, to the university. University College moved into the castle, however the keep was ruinous and needed substantial reconstruction before it could be occupied. In the course of this renovation, the skeleton of a whale was discovered in the castle ruins, and a report on this made at the 1839 meeting of the British Association. It was originally claimed that these were the remains of a whale cast up on the shore of Co. Durham in 1661 and acquired by Bishop Cosin. It was later admitted that the letter on which this claim was based was a forgery. 1837 also saw the university found the first course in engineering at any university institution in England, which opened in January 1838, led by Chevallier and Johnston. While it was initially popular, with admissions exceeding those for Arts or Theology in 1839/40, this did not last. The course was too expensive for students and although leading industrialists supported it, employers did not give any credit for it; it closed a few years later due to falling student numbers, the last students being admitted in 1851. /> Johnston was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 15 June 1837. His sponsors included Charles Wheatstone and Michael Faraday. On 30 May 1839, Thorp was also elected a Fellow, his sponsors including Bishop Maltby (signing E. Dunelm, as Bishop of Durham), as well as William Tooke, one of the founders of UCL, and Leonard Horner, UCL's first Warden. In 1839 the Durham University Observatory was established. This opened in 1842 with an 8-foot (2.44 m) focal length equatorial-mount refractor with a 6.5 inch (17 mm) primary, built by H. Fraunhofer. This was used, in particular, for sunspot observations through the 19th century, as well as for observations of minor planets and comets. 1839 also saw Thorp involved in establishing a diocesan teacher training college for men (later to be St Bede's College, now the College of St Hild and St Bede), with the first Master being John Cundill. This was originally proposed to be part of the university, and the dean and chapter approved a scheme in 1836, but this did not prove practical. The college opened in Framwellgate Moor in 1841 before moving to Leazes Road in 1847. On 4 June 1841 a further Order in Council transferred further estates to the university and attached canonries to the professorships of Divinity and Greek, while the professor of mathematics (Chevallier) was made the professor of mathematics and astronomy. The wardenship of the university was (after the term of the current Warden, Charles Thorp) to be held ex officio by the Dean of Durham, the revenues freed up to be used to establish a professorship in Hebrew. Three weeks after this order was made, John Edwards was appointed professor of Greek, the office having been vacant since Jenkyns' appointment as professor of Divinity in 1839. On 18 May 1843 the university received a grant of arms: These are alternatively described (bringing out the origin of the various elements) as \\"Argent S. Cuthbert's cross (form√©e quadrate) gules; on a canton the arms of Bishop Hatfield: Azure, a chevron or, between three lions rampant argent\\". It is interesting that Bishop Hatfield, the founder of Durham College, Oxford, is commemorated in the arms rather than Bishop Van Mildert. This was not the only attempt to draw a link between the college and the university. In an undated letter to \\"Mr Grey\\" (not the Earl), Thorp wrote: Early university calendars also contained a note setting out the link between the college and the university. It is worth noting also that the head of the mediaeval Durham College was its Warden, the same title assumed by Thorp as head of the new University. Sports and societies 1834 saw the foundation of the Durham Regatta, the second oldest in the country. The university was one of the founding members of the Regatta, along with Durham School and Durham Boat Club. The university was represented by a crew from University College Boat Club in the six-oared Sylph, losing to W. L. Wharton's Velocity in the first race of the Regatta, on 17 June. The first debating society in Durham was founded in 1835. However, this appears to have closed by 1839. In 1842, the Durham University Union debating society was established. It was later revived in 1872‚Äì73, when it took the name of the Durham Union Society and moved to Palace Green. The university played its earliest recorded cricket match away at Sunderland on 17 June 1842, the result being a 58 run victory for the university. The first home cricket match at the Racecourse was played in 1843, again against Sunderland. The oldest recorded scorecard at the Racecourse, from 2 June 1843, is for a drawn two-innings one-day match against Bishopwearmouth. As Bishopwearmouth is part of Sunderland, this may have been the same match. Growth, crisis and revival: 1846‚Äì1909=New colleges in Durham In 1846, Bishop Hatfield's Hall (later to become Hatfield College) was founded with the idea of providing more economical accommodation for students. While University College had followed the system of the Oxbridge colleges, where students were expected to furnish their own rooms, employ their own servants, and buy their own food, David Melville, the first Master of Hatfield, proposed a \\"model college\\" based on three principles: * All rooms were let furnished, with shared servants * All meals were taken in Hall, communally provided * Commons were to be fixed at a reasonable rate, known in advance. This system was discussed by the Royal Commission on the University of Oxford in 1852, who rejected it on the grounds that cheaper halls would provide worse tuition. The idea was, however, taken up by Keble College, Oxford on its foundation in 1870, and has since spread throughout the world. Hatfield's original building had been a coaching inn (the Red Lyon) in the 17th and 18th centuries. The college soon outgrew this and a new building (now the Melville building) was built in 1849 and a chapel was added in 1853. 1851 saw the addition of a third College, Bishop Cosin's Hall, occupying University House on Palace Green (the old Archdeacon's Inn) where University College had first been based. The new colleges and University College were all owned by the university, rather than (like the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge) being independent corporations. This has since been held up as an easier template for new collegiate foundations to follow than Oxbridge, and was the model used in establishing York, Lancaster and Kent as collegiate universities and in establishing residential colleges at US universities. Until the founding of Hatfield, the university and university college had been coextensive. This now changed, making it explicit that the teaching in Durham was carried out by the university, not (as in Oxford, Cambridge and London) partly by the colleges. This was not an innovation as such ‚Äì it had been the older system at Oxford and Cambridge, who had been attacked around the time of Durham's foundation for abandoning it. The University Cricket Club was established in 1846, making it clear that it represented the whole University, but Hatfield established its own Boat Club ‚Äì which claims to have existed from 1846, although the first intercollegiate race was not held until 1854. In 1858, a diocesan teacher training college for women (later St Hild's College) opened on the Leazes Road site, next to the men's college. Academic dress In the 1850s the academic hoods were recorded as being: * LTh: Black stuff trimmed with velvet * BA: Black silk or bombazine, lined with white wool or fur * MA: Black, lined with Palatinate purple or lilac silk * LLD: Scarlet cloth lined with white silk * MB: Purple cloth bound with white fur * MD: Purple cloth with scarlet silk lining * MusD: Purple cloth lined with white silk * BD: Entirely black, corded silk * DD: Scarlet, lined with Palatinate purple. The medical college In June 1851 the Newcastle upon Tyne School of Medicine and Surgery, which had opened on 1 October 1834, split into two following internal disagreements: the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Surgery (supported by the majority of staff), and the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Practical Science. Discussions between the university and the School of Medicine and Surgery had been in progress at the time of the split, and were renewed in October with the College of Medicine and Surgery, against vigorous opposition from the College of Medicine and Practical Science. On 17 December 1851, the College of Medicine and Surgery became the \\"Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine, in connection with the University of Durham\\", this being approved by Convocation on 27 January 1853. The statutes of the university were amended on 20 November 1854 to remove religious tests from degrees, except those in arts and divinity, thus allowing degrees in medicine to be granted without religious distinction, although a religious test was still imposed on members of Convocation. Medical connections were not made only with Newcastle. The medical schools of two Anglican colleges, King's College London and Queen's College, Birmingham, were also affiliated to the university, allowing their students to obtain Durham degrees. The first Licences in Medicine were granted in 1856. In 1857 the College of Medicine and Practical Science merged back into the College of Medicine, and in 1858 the first University examinations for the Bachelor of Medicine degree were held, with external examiners from Oxford and London. Durham was included in the Medical Act 1858 with the same status as the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London. The Commission of 1861 The number of students in the university had peaked at 130 in the early 1850s and by 1861 had fallen to 46. The university was in crisis, and a commission was set up by Act of Parliament in 1861 to look into it. Modern analysis has shown that much of this crisis was due to a stagnation in demand for higher education between the 1820s and the 1860s which, coupled with growth at Oxford and Cambridge, affected all of the newer institutions. One problem identified by the commission was Thorp, who ran the university as his private fiefdom. Melville, who had been dismissed as master of Hatfield in 1851, told the commission that: The commission reported back in June 1862, recommending that the government of the university be removed from the dean and chapter and transferred to the senate, that a school of science be created, in which degrees in science would be awarded (the first science degrees in Britain having been awarded just two years earlier in 1860 by the University of London), that the BA course be shortened to two years, and that arts degrees be opened to non-Anglicans. This was opposed by the dean and chapter, and the Privy Council rejected the recommendations. Thorp, now quite elderly, offered to retire, although he died in October 1862 before this could come into effect. Thorp had been warden since 1831 and master of University College since its opening. On his death, the Dean of Durham, as specified by the 1841 Order in Council, became warden ex officio. The sub-warden, which had been a rotating position, became permanent and eventually evolved into the vice-chancellor. University College gained a separate master. Despite rejecting the commission's recommendations, the dean and chapter proceeded to implement virtually all of them ‚Äì except for their giving up control. New statutes in 1865 removed religious tests from all qualifications except licences and degrees in theology, although membership of Convocation remained closed to non-Anglicans until after the Universities Tests Act 1871. The residence required for the BA degree was reduced to two years ‚Äì although a \\"Student's Guide to the University of Durham\\" in 1880 recommended that, although it was possible to gain a pass degree in two years, \\"Candidates for honours should, if possible, allow themselves three years for the whole course\\". The length of the academic year was also increased from 6 months to 8. Bishop Cosin's Hall closed as a separate College in 1864, being merged into University College. In order to give graduates of the university a voice, the Durham University Society (now the Dunelm Society) was formed in London as an independent alumni association. It held its first meeting on 31 May 1866. The College of Physical Sciences An attempt was made to establish a school of sciences at Durham in 1865, but this came to nothing. In 1870 the Newcastle College of Medicine became a college of the university as the Durham University College of Medicine. It gained representation on the senate, and residence in the college now counted as residence in the university ‚Äì so it was no longer necessary to live in Durham for a period to gain a degree. In 1871 the university and the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, led by Nicholas Wood, established the College of Physical Sciences in Newcastle upon Tyne. ¬£20,000 was raised by public subscription, and the university made an annual grant of ¬£1,000, covering the salaries of professors in mathematics and physics. It originally granted the non-degree title of Associate in Science. The college was formally incorporated into the university in 1874, gaining the right to award the BSc and have representation in the Senate. The MSc (granting membership of Convocation) was added in 1878, and the DSc in 1882. The College of Physical Sciences was the second provincial university college to be established, after Owens College in Manchester. From the start in 1871, the lecture and laboratory courses of the college were open to women, who were able to take the non-degree ASc but could not (at that time) proceed to degrees. However, the first women did not actually enter until 1880, when Isabel Aldis won an exhibition at the college. In 1883 the College of Physical Sciences was incorporated as a company under the name of the Durham College of Science. In 1886 land was acquired in Lax's Gardens for new buildings; construction started in 1887 with Sir W. G. Armstrong (later Lord Armstrong) laying the foundation stone and the college moving to the new site in 1888. In 1889, the College of Science was one of 11 university colleges to be awarded funding through the \\"Grant to University Colleges in Great Britain\\". 1886 also saw the college establish the first chair of mining in England, filled by John Herman Merivale who had been the college's first student 15 years earlier. The curriculum was also expanded, with the School of Art merging into the college and the introduction of humanities subjects leading to the BLitt and DLitt from 1895 (the BA remaining limited to those studying at the Durham colleges). At the College of Medicine degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Hygiene (BHy and DHy) were introduced in 1891 and a diploma in public health in 1894. Unlike the Durham colleges, the two colleges in Newcastle were engaged in teaching and employed their own professors. In 1904 the Durham College of Science was renamed Armstrong College in honour of Lord Armstrong, whose friends and admirers raised ¬£50,000 for the college after his death, to be used to complete the buildings, on condition that the name be changed. Growth in Durham Back in Durham, \\"unattached\\" mature students were admitted from 1870: these were non-resident students who were not associated with a college. In 1888 the unattached students founded St Cuthbert's Society. The men's teacher training college (named St Bede's College from 1886) was affiliated to the university from 1892, while the women's teacher training college was affiliated from 1896, in which year it was also renamed St Hild's College. The university also formed overseas links with two Anglican institutions: Codrington College in Barbados in 1875 and Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone in 1876. Via the latter of these, Durham awarded what was probably the first BA in Africa to Nathaniel Davis in 1878. The Times said \\"it would not be much longer before the University of Durham was affiliated to the Zoo\\", and although Durham was proud of what it was doing, the reaction in Sierra Leone was more mixed: Also in 1876 the university passed regulations allowing the affiliation of theological colleges, allowing students who obtained their licences to proceed to a Durham BA with only 1 year of residence and only sitting the final examination. Affiliated colleges in 1882 were: St Aidan's College, Birkenhead, St Augustine's College, Canterbury, St Bees Theological College, Chichester Theological College, Cumbrae Theological College, Edinburgh Theological College, Gloucester Theological College, Highbury Theological College, Lichfield Theological College, Lincoln Theological College, St Boniface Missionary College, Warminster, and the theological departments of King's College London and Queen's College, Birmingham. In 1882, the university celebrated its golden jubilee with the award of forty honorary degrees, including a DD for John Cundill, the installation of a stained glass window designed by C E. Kempe in the great hall of the castle, a concert, and services in the cathedral, where Bishop Lightfoot preached. Women students The university had originally voted to admit women in 1881, only three years after London had done so. However, implementation was delayed by disputes over who would pay for a women's college ‚Äì the university did not have the money, and (unlike at Oxford and Cambridge) private backers were not forthcoming. A further blow was dealt in 1886 when the university sought a legal opinion and discovered it did not have the right under its current charter to grant degrees to women. Women were, however, allowed to study at the College of Science from its opening in 1871, although the first women did not enter until 1880, and it had over thirty women students by 1893. The situation was allowed to rest for a while, until in 1892 Ella Bryant passed the BSc examination with second class honours in physics. In June 1893 she tried to pay the fee for the BSc degree, but was refused. The university applied for a supplemental charter \\"almost immediately\\" after this, allowing it to grant degrees to women in all subjects but divinity, and it was granted in 1895. Bryant received her BSc on 24 June 1895, becoming the first woman to receive a degree from Durham. The first women to matriculate in Durham itself were three women from St Hild's College and two \\"Home Students\\" (later to be organised as St Aidan's Society, now St Aidan's College). The Hild students were the first to gain degrees, graduating with BLitts in 1898. The first BA followed in 1899, being awarded to a \\"Miss Thomas\\", a member of staff at St Hild's, who also went on to become the first woman MA in 1902, although women were not admitted to Convocation until 1913. In 1899 the Women's Hostel (now St Mary's College) was founded on Claypath, moving to the Abbey House on Palace Green in 1901. Once it had the supplemental charter, Durham went further than other universities in opening up courses not only in Arts and Science but also in medicine, the College of Medicine becoming the first mixed medical school in England. In 1900 women could study medicine in England at Durham or the London School of Medicine for Women. By 1901, the London School of Medicine for Women was affiliated to Durham, enabling students there to take Durham degrees. New colleges Durham graduate Thomas Wilkinson became Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle in 1889 and president of the Catholic seminary, Ushaw College, near Durham, in 1890. Ushaw had been affiliated to the University of London since 1840, but in 1900 became affiliated to Durham for a decade, before reverting to London following Wilkinson's death. St Chad's College, one of the two independent colleges At the start of the 20th century, the university thus consisted of a college, a hall and a women's hostel in Durham, all owned by the university, along with non-collegiate men in St Cuthbert's Society and \\"home\\" women students, all taught centrally by the university; two affiliated teacher training colleges in Durham sending students to University lectures; a medical college in Newcastle; and a government-funded university college in Newcastle. In 1904 an independent Anglican foundation, St Chad's Hall (now St Chad's College), was established in Durham and licensed as a hall of residence. This was linked to St Chad's Hostel, established in Doncaster in 1902 in the Anglo-Catholic tradition to prepare students to enter theological colleges. In 1909 this was joined by another Anglican foundation, St John's Hall (now St John's College), established by St John's Theological College in Highbury, in the Evangelical tradition. Constitutional stresses The first Student Representative Council (SRC) in the university was formed in the late 19th century in the College of Medicine. The Durham Colleges SRC was formed around 1900 using the College of Medicine SRC as a model. The Durham University SRC, with equal representation for the Durham Colleges, Armstrong College and the College of Medicine, was formed in 1907. The constitutional arrangements were put under severe strain by the growth of the Newcastle colleges, which outnumbered the Durham colleges three to one, and the movement of the other provincial university colleges to independent university status from 1900. A new arrangement was proposed by Armstrong's principal, Sir Isambard Owen, in 1907. This would have made the Newcastle colleges self-governing; transferred the government from the dean and chapter to the Senate (as had been proposed in 1862), replaced the warden by a chancellor appointed by the Senate; given Durham and Newcastle equal representation in the Senate; stripped Convocation of its veto; and opened the possibility of transferring the seat of the university to Newcastle. The last two items, in particular, proved contentious, and the necessary bill was blocked in parliament until a compromise could be reached. This was that the graduates gained increased representation on the Senate, Convocation (rather than Senate) would appoint the chancellor, and the seat of the university was fixed in Durham. The Durham University Act, enabling new statutes to be drawn up, received Royal Assent in April 1908, and the new statutes themselves were finally agreed and approved by the Privy Council in November 1909, transforming Durham into a federal university. The federal university 1910‚Äì63=The new constitution After the new statues were approved, George William Kitchin, dean of Durham and formerly the warden, became the first chancellor of the university, and the sub-warden (Frank Byron Jevons, also principal of Hatfield) became the first vice-chancellor. The university property in Durham was passed to the newly formed Council of Durham Colleges ‚Äì representing only University College, Hatfield Hall, and the Women's Hostel. The first president of the Council of Durham Colleges was George Nickson, then suffragan Bishop of Jarrow and later Bishop of Bristol, who served 1910‚Äì1911. He was succeeded by John Stapylton Grey Pemberton, who served until the changes of the university's constitution in 1937 and was also vice-chancellor 1918‚Äì1919. New regulations allowed students at Armstrong College to take a \\"Modern B.A.\\", while Durham division students whose BA included Latin and Greek could add \\"in litteris antiquis\\" after their degree. Provision was also made for the affiliation of Sunderland Technical College (now Sunderland University) once it reached a sufficient standard, and any other college in the counties of Durham, Northumbria, Cumberland and Westmoreland. In 1913, women were admitted to Convocation. The First World War saw 2,500 students and staff serve, and 325 killed. Many buildings were requisitioned in both Durham and Newcastle, and the number of students dropped so low that the university had to deny it was closing. The finances of both the Durham Colleges and Armstrong College were, however, perilously low, leading to an appeal to the government for assistance. Post-World War One expansion In 1919, Bishop Hatfield's Hall became Hatfield College, St Bede's was licensed as a hall of residence, and St Chad's and St John's both adopted the style of independent colleges. In 1920 the Women's Hostel became St Mary's College and moved into a former prebendal house in the college (now home to the Choristers School). St John's and St Chad's were both formally made \\"constituent colleges\\" of the university in 1923, and St Hild's was licensed as a Hall of Residence. In 1921 Durham County Council established Neville's Cross College as a women's teacher training college. It became a licensed hall of the university in 1924. In 1920 the university had 900 students in Newcastle but only 200 in Durham. The University Grants Committee told the university in 1921 that it must produce ambitious expansion plans if it was to receive funding. This led to the establishment of a school of education and, in 1924, a faculty of pure science on what became known as the Science Site (now the Mountjoy site) on Elvet Hill. The Botanic Gardens were established on the Science Site in 1925. Important appointments at this time included Arthur Holmes, pioneer of geochronology and plate tectonics, as professor of geology and climatologist Gordon Manley, who established the Durham temperature series (based on meteorological observations at Durham Observatory and other sources) back to 1801 and the Central England temperature series dating back to 1659, as head of Geography. By 1935 numbers in Durham had more than doubled in 15 years to 475 (including 103 women), while Newcastle had grown to 1155 students. During the 1920s and 30s, Durham Castle, home to University College, was found to be in danger of collapsing into the Wear. The issue was discussed in the House of Lords, with the government sympathising but saying there was nothing they could do to help ‚Äì only ancient monuments were eligible for financial assistance, and these could not be occupied buildings. It was pointed out by Lord Gainford that this meant the government could help with the ruin once the Castle fell into the River, but could not act to prevent the castle being ruined. By 1927 the Great Hall was too dangerous to use, with degree convocations being moved to the cathedral's Chapter House. The Durham Castle Preservation Fund raised around ¬£100,000 in a nationwide campaign, with the government providing ¬£10,000 in 1937. By 1934 underpinning had ensured the castle wouldn't collapse and convocations for degrees returned in December1936, but it wasn't until early 1939 that the castle was completely stabilisedd and could be fully returned to use. The university's centenary should have been celebrated in 1932, but with the northeast still in the grip of the Great Depression the celebrations were postponed until the centenary of the Royal Charter in 1937. 1932 did see the publication of a centenary history of the university, The University of Durham 1832 ‚Äì 1932 by Charles Whiting, professor of history at the university, who also edited a small volume for the 1937 celebrations Constitutional crisis In the 1930s, the federal University was plunged into a constitutional crisis by arguments between the two Newcastle colleges. Austerity was imposed on the College of Medicine by the Registrar and the treasurer in 1931, who also demanded the resignation of the principal without going through the Senate. This was compounded by their termination of an agreement with Armstrong College for medical students to receive teaching in physics, chemistry and biology there. The head of the UGC demanded action, and a Royal Commission was established by Act of Parliament in 1935 to look into the matter. The commission recommended changes to the university's constitution, of which the most visible was the merger of the two Newcastle colleges to form King's College (originally to be called University College, Newcastle until the Durham colleges objected). The two divisions also gained permanent heads: the rector of King's College and the warden of the Durham Colleges, with the vice-chancellorship alternated between them (the legacy of this lives on, in that the executive head of the university is still called \\"the vice-chancellor and warden\\"). Convocation's veto was abolished and a University Court established, and academic appointments were made the responsibility of the central University. The Senate was made responsible for granting degrees, which had previously been a function of Convocation. As a result, the ceremony at which degrees are conferred at Durham was separated from the meeting of Convocation and become known as Congregation. The new University Court set about fundraising for an expansion of the Durham division, with plans for new buildings for St Mary's College, the Student Union and the science laboratories. The importance of this expansion was emphasised by a fall in the number of students to the low 400s in 1939 due to cutbacks in teacher training, although Newcastle grew to 1500. In early 1939, permission was given to start work on the science site and the union, but this was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War. By the end of 1940, the number of students in Durham had fallen to only 270, forcing Hatfield and University colleges to temporarily merge. But 1941 saw RAF cadets sent to Durham to study science ‚Äì primarily maths, physics and mechanics ‚Äì raising student numbers back to healthier levels. Newcastle, with its much larger student population, was much less affected than the Durham Colleges. Expansion after World War Two After the war, the Durham division expanded rapidly ‚Äì the Warden, Sir James Duff, believing not only that growth was essential but that more accommodation was the necessary first step to growing the division. Durham had to be a residential university ‚Äì it didn't have the local population to thrive otherwise. He planned to double the number of students in Durham to over 1000 in a decade. Under pressure from the UGC, this target was raised to 2000 in 1946. Newcastle was also constrained ‚Äì at 1700 students it had reached what was felt to be the local capacity, and (like the other civic universities) would have to start looking further afield to attract students in order to reach its target of 3000. 1947 saw progress towards this goal. St Aidan's Society (St Aidan's College from 1965) was founded as the female counterpart to St Cuthbert's Society, catering for the non-resident \\"home student\\" women, and moved onto Shincliffe Hall; the foundation stone for the new St. Mary's College building on Elvet Hill was laid by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II); and plans for a new men's college (to become Grey College) were approved by the Council of the Durham Colleges. In the same year, the College of the Venerable Bede (as St Bede's College had been renamed in 1935) became a constituent college of the university. Lumley Castle was also leased from 1945 to house students from University College. By 1948 the Durham division hit 1100 students ‚Äì the growth in numbers outstripping the residential capacity of the university and leaving a third of students without College accommodation ‚Äì while Newcastle had over 3200. St Mary's took five years to build, the new site finally opening in 1952. In the same year final approval was given to the establishment of a new men's college south of the river, linked with the expansion of the science site. However, although the UGC approved the plan, funds were not immediately available, however, and it was 1956 before financial approval was given and 1957 before building work began. The new college opened in 1959 as Grey College ‚Äì the name being chosen over Cromwell College by a single vote ‚Äì but the main block was not completed until 1961. Expansion also continued in other parts of the university. The West Building, for the departments of geography and mathematics, opened in 1952. Work on a new central admissions system, replacing the system whereby students applied to individual colleges, began in 1958. In the same year St John's College was formally divided into two closely linked parts: St John's Hall for University students and Cranmer Hall for those preparing for ordination. 1960 saw the opening of the department of applied science. In 1961, St Aidan's Society moved into its new building and became St Aidan's College. Work on Dunelm House and Kingsgate Bridge started in 1962. In 1960 the council set a target of 3,000 students by the early 1970s, and in 1962 a target of 4,500 students by the early 1980s. Two more men's colleges (to become Van Mildert College and Collingwood College) and a third women's college (to become Trevelyan College) were planned. In 1946 the University College of the West Indies was established, affiliated to the University of London. In 1955 this became the University of the West Indies (UWI) and Codrington College stopped offering degrees except in theology. In 1965, Coddington became affiliated to the UWI and no longer offered undergraduate Durham degrees. Codrington's affiliation to Durham was finally removed from the University Statutes on 13 July 2011. Tensions between the Newcastle and Durham divisions In 1947, tensions had surfaced again over the Durham-Newcastle divide, with the growth in numbers meaning \\"the two divisions were acting as de facto universities\\". Lord Percy, rector of King's College, proposed that the university change its name to the 'University of Durham and Newcastle', with the divisions becoming 'Durham University' and 'Newcastle University'. This idea was defeated in Convocation (the assembly of members of the university) by 135 votes to 129. By the late 1950s, Durham had over 1,500 students and Newcastle 3,500. The academic board of the Newcastle division passed a resolution on 29 January 1960 calling for Newcastle to become an independent university: On 23 February 1960 the academic board of the Durham division gave their agreement and by June the Council of King's College and the Council of the Durham Colleges had both approved. The government and the UGC approved the plan on 21 July, and by May 1961 statutes had been drafted. The Universities of Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne Act received Royal assent on 10 July 1963, and on 1 August 1963 King's College became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, leaving Durham University once more based solely in its home city. Modern university 1963‚Äì99 The university's new statutes abolished the court but maintained the title of Warden of the Durham Colleges, with the executive head of the university being the vice-chancellor and warden. In 1963, the university consisted of five council colleges (now styled maintained colleges), with a further three planned, St Cuthbert's Society, the three independent constituent colleges (now styled recognised colleges), and the two licensed halls (the women's teacher training colleges: St Hild's and Neville's Cross). Expansion continued, with Grey College's third building opening in 1963. In 1964 the centralised admissions system went into operation. Van Mildert College, the School of Engineering, the Durham Business School, the Graduate Society (now Ustinov College), the Maiden Castle sports ground and a number of other academic departments all opened in 1965; and in the same year the BEd degree was introduced for students at the teacher training colleges. Trevelyan College and the new buildings for St Aidan's College opened in 1966. The botanic garden moved to its current site in 1970. Construction of new residences for University College in Durham also meant Lumley Castle could finally be given up in 1970. Sierra Leone had gained its independence in 1961, and in 1967 the government established the University of Sierra Leone. Fourah Bay College joined Njala University College to form the new University and ended its affiliation with Durham. In 1963, Neville's Cross College became mixed, and in 1966 Cranmer Hall in St John's College became the first Anglican theological college in the world to train women for ordination. The Roman Catholic seminary of Ushaw College, which had been located in Ushaw Moor near Durham since 1808, was licensed as a hall of residence in 1968. St Chad's Hall stopped training for the Anglican priesthood in 1972, and in 1976 changed its name to St Chad's College. In 1965 the sports hall at Maiden Castle opened and in 1966 Dunelm House was finally completed, providing centralised student facilities and a home for the Student Representative Council and the Athletics Union moved in. In 1969 the Statutes were amended to give the president of the Student Representative Council a seat on the University Council. In 1970 the Student Representative Council became Durham Student Union. In the 1970s the reorganisation of teacher training by the government threatened the existence of the three teacher training colleges. In 1975 St Hild's College and the College of the Venerable Bede merged to form the College of St Hild and St Bede, remaining a Recognised College and teaching a university-validated BEd. This lasted until 1979 when it surrendered its autonomy to become a Maintained College of the university, with all teacher training being transferred to the university's School of Education. Neville's Cross College merged with Durham Technical College in 1977, leaving the university and forming New College Durham. Following the lowering of the age of majority from 21 to 18 in 1970, meaning universities were no longer in loco parentis, Van Mildert became the first maintained college to go mixed in 1971, with some students transferring in from other colleges that year followed by a full intake in 1972. This was followed in 1972 by the opening of Collingwood College as the first purpose- built mixed college, and the first university residence in the UK to have men's and women's rooms in the same blocks. In 1973 St John's College went fully mixed, admitting women to St John's Hall. St Aidan's decided to become mixed in 1978, with the first men entering in 1981 ‚Äì the first of the Women's colleges to do so. This was followed by Grey JCR voting to go mixed in 1983, and the college governing board ratifying the decision. Some women students who had not won places at other colleges were admitted in 1984 and the first full intake was in 1985. Decisions by college governing boards and the University Council in 1986 led to the final three men's colleges going mixed, in some cases against the wishes of the students: University College in 1987, and Hatfield and St Chad's in 1988. In October 1987, Trevelyan's governing body voted to go mixed despite the JCR voting to remain women-only. The first men were admitted in 1990. In 1986 Durham Castle and Cathedral were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the first group of sites recognised in the UK. This was extended in 2008 to cover Palace Green and the surrounding buildings. In 1987 the perception still existed that the university was too small. The student population was limited to 5000 (4936 in 1987), and had only grown by 200 over the previous 5 years. The Senate noted in May 1988 that expansion was desirable, but that it would be more cost effective, and less risky to do this by making \\"more intensive use ‚Ä¶ of the present facilities\\" rather than establishing a new College. By 1990 numbers had reached 5,908 and by 1995, 9,717 in Durham City or 10,436 including Stockton (see below) ‚Äì doubling the population in under ten years. In 1988 the Wesley Study Centre opened within St John's College as a training centre for Methodist ministers, forming a unique ecumenical partnership with Cranmer Hall to train Anglican and Methodist ministers alongside each other. In 1989 the university started its fund-raising and alumni office, with a virtual community for alumnihttp://www.dunelm.org.uk dunelm.org.uk and several large gifts made to the university, including for the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies, the Department of Physics and the Wolfson Research Institute. 1990 saw the opening of the Teikyo University of Japan in Durham, an overseas campus of Teikyo University in Japan, by Katharine, Duchess of Kent. From 1993 to 1997 the university attempted unsuccessfully to raise funds for a new college at Howlands Farm. In 1997 the decision was made to instead build postgraduate accommodation on the site under the management of the existing Graduate Society. In 1994, Durham was one of the founder members of the 1994 Group of smaller research-intensive universities, set up in response to the establishment of the Russell Group. Development in Stockton The idea of Durham University establishing a presence on Teesside was first floated in 1987 and planning began in earnest in 1988 for a \\"Birkbeck of the North\\" with around 1,000 students. Teesside was, at that time, the largest conurbation in Europe without a university, and the Teesside Development Corporation had recently been established to try to regenerate the area. In April 1989 a formal announcement was made that Teesside Polytechnic and Durham University were working together \\"in planning a major development in Higher Education in Cleveland and its adjacent areas\\". Stresses in the partnership arise in December 1989, when Durham approved plans for a new Institute of Health Studies without discussions with the Polytechnic. This led in January 1990 to a formula establishing the development as a Joint University College between Durham and Teesside rather than (as originally conceived) a Durham college with backing from Teesside. This was approved by Senate in mid February and the initiative was launched publicly three days later. The initial bid to the funding councils (the Universities Funding Council ‚Äì UFC; and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council ‚Äì PCFC) was for 280 students initially, rising to 840 after three years. In 1991 the UFC and PCFC agreed to fund 100 places each initially, rising to 225 each ‚Äì only half of what had been hoped for. Nevertheless, plans went ahead and a site opposite Stockton-on-Tees on the south bank of the river was chosen. The Joint University College on Teesside (JUCOT) was formally launched on 3 September 1991 by Michael Fallon, Schools Minister and MP for Darlington. On 1 January 1992, Robert Parfitt was appointed as the first principal of the college. Later that year Durham's statutes were modified to allow it grant joint degrees, regulations for the degrees to be awarded by JUCOT were established, and JUCOT was formally incorporated as a Limited Company established under a joint venture agreement between Durham and Teesside. The name did not, however, prove acceptable to the various government departments, nor was the alternative of Queen's College (there were too many already), but the name of University College, Stockton was approved just before opening on 12 October 1992 with an initial enrolment of 190 students. Near the end of is first year of operation, the college was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 18 May 1993. The 1993 academic year saw student numbers grow to 430 with the addition of teacher training. In 1994, at the suggestion of the UCS board, Durham assumed administrative and financial responsibility for the college. At the same time, approval was given to build student residences at Stockton, and the Privy Council approved changes to Durham's statutes making UCS a residential and teaching college of the university. Parfitt retired in April 1994 and was replaced as principal by John Hayward. Integration with Durham began, with the departments being established as Boards of Studies, and the company being wound up ‚Äì its board of directors becoming (like Durham colleges) a board of governors, still including Teesside but with increased representation from Durham. In 1996 it was agreed that students at Stockton would take degrees of Durham from 1998, rather than the joint degrees that had been awarded previously. With Durham taking on sole responsibility in 1998, the campus was renamed the University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC), separating teaching responsibilities from UCS. 21st century In 2000 the new Graduate Society accommodation and offices at the Howlands Farm site were opened. The Graduate Society became Ustinov College in 2003. By 2000 student numbers at University College, Stockton had reached 1,350, with plans to grow to 2,000 by 2003. It was bigger than any other Durham college, and set to keep growing. It was therefore decided to split UCS into two colleges that would be similar to the colleges in Durham City. The colleges were established as \\"shadow colleges\\" in October 2000. The two new colleges, named John Snow and Stephenson (originally George Stephenson) after the physician and the engineer, were formally established in September 2001, replacing UCS. Also in 2001 the new medical school at UDSC (operating in association with the University of Newcastle upon Tyne) took in its first students ‚Äì the first medics to join Durham since 1963 ‚Äì and the Wolfson Research Institute opened. In 2002, her golden jubilee year, the Queen granted UDSC the title of \\"Queen's Campus\\". 2002 saw the location for degree congregations moved from Durham Castle and Stockton Parish Church to Durham Cathedral, reducing the number of ceremonies from 24 (3 in Stockton) to a more manageable 12. By 2003, 10 years after Stockton's opening, the university had 11,021 undergraduates, 17% of them on the Queen's Campus, and 2843 postgraduates. By 2013 this had increased to 12550 undergraduates, still with 17% in Stockton, and 4538 postgraduates. In 2003 the last single-sex college, St. Mary's, which was receiving fewer than 200 direct applications each year, voted to go mixed. The first undergraduate men entered in 2005. In 2004 the university started the building of a new college next to Ustinov on the Howlands Farm site, as well as the construction of more accommodation for Ustinov. This opened in 2006 as Josephine Butler College, the first completely new college to open in Durham itself since the 1970s, and the only purpose- built self-catering college within Durham. 2003 also saw the announcement of a controversial Strategic Improvement Plan. This included the closure of the departments of East Asian Studies and European Studies, the transfer if Linguistics to Newcastle (receiving their department of Religious Studies in return) and the movement of Middle East and Islamic Studies to become postgraduate-only, losing is undergraduate intake. The closures were expected to free up ¬£8.7M for re-investment in more popular courses. The closure, particularly of East Asian Studies, meet with opposition from the Foreign Office, Durham City Council and the Japan Foundation. The cuts formed part of a tend in UK higher education at the time for small departments to be closed or merged, linked by The Guardian to \\"a combination of market forces and a strict funding regime\\". A 2003 article by John Crace, also written for The Guardian, suggested the reforms were driven by Durham not having 'high numbers of overseas or postgraduate students to augment the balance sheet', which influenced the selection of departments to be shut down ‚Äì East Asian Studies students being comparatively more expensive to teach and limited in number, while the business school was apparently saved (despite then having one of the worst research ratings in the university) because it was one of the few parts of the university to attract any great number of overseas students. In 2004 Durham was shortlisted for the Sunday Times University of the Year. In 2005 it was shortlisted again and won the award. In 2005, the university unveiled a new logo (consisting of a stylised monochrome version of the coat of arms in palatinate purple) and logotype, and adopted the trading name of \\"Durham University\\". The new branding caused much discussion, and Van Mildert JCR voted not to use the new name and logo. The official name of the institution remains the University of Durham and no change was made to the actual coat of arms. The Charities Act 2006 necessitated a number of changes to the structure of the university's student bodies that went into effect in 2011. Previously exempt charities, Student Unions were now to be regulated by the Charity Commission for England and Wales. The College JCRs were forced to decide whether to remain independent and become registered charities or to become part of the university. The university set up the \\"Durham Student Organisations Framework\\" for those JCRs (from the Maintained Colleges) becoming part of the university. Most eligible JCRs, along with Team Durham (previously the Durham University Athletics Union) and some other University- wide student bodies, chose to join this framework. Durham Students Union, the JCRs of Grey, St Cuthbert's and Trevelyan, and the Ustinov GCR, became independent charities on 1 August 2011. Trevelyan JCR has since joined the framework (on 1 January 2014) and ceased to be an independent charity. St John's JCR also chose to become an independent charity rather than be merged with the college. The Act also removed exempt charity status from the colleges and halls in the universities of Cambridge and Durham and the colleges in the University of Oxford. This forced the St John's College, St Chad's College, and Ushaw College to become registered charities (the Maintained Colleges, being legally incorporated into the university and thus not having separate charitable status, were not affected). In 2007 the campus cafeteria, \\"The Waterside Room\\", was renovated and now serves as the campus student bar. In addition to this facility both colleges at the campus benefit from their own college bars, managed centrally, however, and not by their JCRs. In 2007 the university announced that it had acquired an option on of land in the 56-acre Northshore development on the north bank of the Tees, opposite the existing Queen's Campus site, along with plans to develop the academic structure at Queen's and the possibility of a new college. In 2012 it was announced that after a four-year delay due to the state of the economy, the Northshore development was proceeding, including plans from the university for academic facilities and a 500-bed residential development. The Queen's Campus cafeteria, was reopened after renovation in February 2008 to serve as a dining room, the Waterside Restaurant, used two days a week by each of the two Queen's Campus colleges, and their joint college bar, the Waterside Bar. On 14 May 2009 the Infinity Bridge was opened, linking the Queen's Campus and the Teasdale business park to the Northshore development. In November 2015 it was announced that the university would not be renewing its option on development of the Northshore site and would be holding a \\"wide and robust consultation process\\" on the future of the Queen's Campus. In Durham City, development was concentrated in the Elvet Hill area, leading to fears that Durham was moving away from the city centre and becoming a \\"campus university\\". The Calman Learning Centre on the Mountjoy Site opened in 2007. This was followed by Anthropology moving to Mountjoy and Economics moving to the Business School. In 2012 the new Palatine Centre was opened on the Mountjoy Site, housing the Law school and the university administration and an extension to the Bill Bryson library on the Mountjoy Site was opened. However, the university also spent ¬£10 million on the refurbishment of the Palace Green Library between 2009 and 2014, creating new galleries and a special exhibitions space. In 2006 the university partnered with Manchester and Edinburgh to create the Centre for Advanced Study of the Arab World with funding from the UK government. In 2008 the university created the Sharjah Chair in Islamic Law and Finance with an endowment from Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, Emir of Sharjah. This followed an earlier donation in 1999 by the Emir, which funded the construction of the Al Qasimi building (opened in 2003). The decision to accept funding from Al-Qasimi was criticised as spreading \\"extremist ideas\\" by Anthony Glees, director of Brunel University's Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies, who had previously claimed a number of British universities had been infiltrated by Islamic extremists. In 2008 Durham launched the Centre for Catholic Studies in collaboration with the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, including the Bede Professor of Catholic Theology, the first chair in Catholic theology at a secular University in the UK. As the Bede Professor serves as theological advisor to the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, the post is (following legal advice) restricted to practising Catholics, but the holder is not required to obtain the mandatum. However, in 2011 Ushaw College closed as a Catholic seminary. It remains (as of 2015) a Licensed Hall of Residence in the university's statutes. Parts of Ushaw are currently used by Durham University Business School and Josephine Butler College, as well as the Centre for Catholic Studies. The Ushaw library has been integrated with the Durham University library, and the university is investigating the possibility of Ushaw becoming home to a new university college. In 2014 a ¬£2M endowment was secured to establish the St Hilda Chair in Catholic Social Thought and Practice. In October 2015 the Catholic National Library moved to Durham University. The university's Department of Theology is partly housed in buildings on Dun Cow Lane In July 2009, Tony Blair, the former British Prime Minister, announced a strategic partnership with Durham University, following Yale University and the National University of Singapore, to create a global network of twelve leading research universities for delivering his Faith and Globalization Initiative in association with Tony Blair Faith Foundation. Between 2010 and 2012, Durham was criticised for accepting a number of donations from controversial sources. On 28 January 2010, Durham hosted a seminar sponsored by the government of Iran, which attracted protests and coverage in the national press. In February 2011, the Durham Student newspaper Palatinate broke the story that a WikiLeaks cable revealed that a series of Iranian seminars at Durham had been funded by the US State Department as \\"political cover\\" for contacts with Iran. Vice-Chancellor Chris Higgins claimed in an interview with Palatinate that the funding had not been deliberately hidden and would have been revealed if anyone had asked, but accepted that more should have been done to let participants know the source of the funding. In March 2011, Conservative MP Robert Halfon accused Durham of accepting \\"blood money\\" from the Iranian government and launched an Early Day Motion (which attracted no other signatories) calling for a Government enquiry. Later that month it was revealed that the university had accepted a ¬£2.5M donation from the prime minister of Kuwait, Sheikh Nasser Al-Sabah, to endow the Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad Al-Sabah Chair and a related research programme in global security, leading to further criticism. This was overshadowed a few weeks later by the news that Durham had accepted ¬£125,000 from British American Tobacco towards an appeal for scholarships for Afghan women from Kabul University. The university claimed that \\"The BAT donation was accepted following careful consideration by the University Executive Committee (UEC) in line with its Gift Acceptance Policy\\". However, Cancer Research UK claimed that \\"The death and disease caused by BAT's products dwarf this small award\\" and accused Durham of breaching the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In July 2012, it was reported by WikiLeaks that an aide to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to receive a PhD from Durham. Halfon again attacked the university, which responded with a statement saying that students were admitted and awarded degrees solely on merit and denying \\"any formal or active links with the Syrian government\\". In September the al-Sabah programme was officially launched in the presence of Sheikh Nasser al-Sabah. However, since pledging his donation the Sheikh had been forced to resign as prime minister of Kuwait in late 2011 over allegations his government had misappropriated state funds. Despite his being cleared of the allegations by a judicial tribunal in May 2012, this drew further protests from Halfon and links were drawn by the Daily Telegraph between this and the acceptance by the London School of Economics of donations from Saif al-Islam, son of Libyan leader Colonel Ghadaffi. In November 2012 it was revealed by the Times Higher Education that the university's senior management had overruled the Ethics Committee to accept the donation from British American Tobacco. It was also revealed that the university and British American Tobacco had agreed not to publicise the donation for fear of attracting criticism and that the executive committee had been split over accepting the money. The Times Higher Education revealed there had been resignations from the university's council over the issue and asked if the resignation of the university's registrar in June 2012 was also linked. In 2012 Durham, along with three other universities, accepted an invitation to join the Russell Group and left the 1994 Group. In July 2012, Council endorsed a \\"residential accommodation strategy\\" for 2012‚Äì2020. This sets a target of 50‚Äì70% of students housed in University accommodation and predicted growth in student numbers to 14,000 in Durham City and 2,500 at the Queen's Campus by 2015/16 and to 15,300 in Durham City and 3,400 at the Queen's Campus by 2019/20. With 5,700 beds in Durham and 900 in Stockton for 2012/13, meeting the accommodation targets would require (in Durham) 1,250 new beds by 2015 and 1,950 by 2019 and (in Stockton) 730 new beds by 2015 and 1,150 by 2019. In the same year Council approved plans for a new 500 room college, with the preferred site being the former golf course at Mount Oswald. In 2014 the university acquired the land on Mount Oswald and entered into a contract with the developers to build accommodation for 1000 students. Also in 2012, the Church of England announced that Durham had been chosen as the partner university for the Common Award for ministerial training. This scheme provides for a common suite of awards, validated by Durham, for all ordinands in the Church of England and its partner churches from September 2014. The Methodist Connexion decided in 2012 that our would be centralising ministerial training in two centres, meaning the withdrawal of ministerial trainees from the Wesley Study Centre, with the last ministerial candidates graduating in 2014. It was announced in 2014 that the centre would be remaining open as a research and postgraduate education centre. In 2013, the Michael Ramsey Chair in Anglican Studies (not to be confused with Kent's Michael Ramsey Chair in Modern Theology) was established in partnership with Durham Cathedral. This, like the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity is a canon professorship, with the holder being a non-residentiary canon of the cathedral. The holder is not (unlike the Van Mildert Professor, who is a residentiary canon) required to be ordained but is required, as a member of the college of canons, to be \\"a communicant member of the Church of England or the Anglican Communion, or of any other member church of Churches Together in Britain and Ireland (which includes most Christian denominations), or of a church in communion with such a church\\". The first Ramsey Professor, Michael Snape, was appointed in 2015. In 2014 Durham established the UNESCO Chair in Archaeological Ethics and Practice in Cultural Heritage, the first UNESCO chair in Durham and the thirteenth in the UK. In 2014 Durham won the Times and Sunday Times Sports University of the Year 2015, and in 2015 it was shortlisted for the third time for the Times and Sunday Times University of the Year 2016. In November 2015 it was announced that the university would not be renewing its option on development of the site on the north bank of the Tees and would be holding a consultation on the future of the Queen's Campus. In February 2016 it was announced that the university's working group had recommended moving the colleges and academic activities currently at the Queen's Campus to Durham City from September 2017. This decision was confirmed in May 2016, with the School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health being transferred to Newcastle University on 1 August 2017. The Queen's Campus is to remain part of the university and will be repurposed as an International Study Centre, to be run by Study Group.

Styles=Beginning of 20th century The Art Nouveau style was introduced in Italy by figures such as Giuseppe Sommaruga and Ernesto Basile (the former designed the Palazzo Castiglioni and the latter expanded the Palazzo Montecitorio in Rome). The principles of this new style were published in 1914 in the Manifesto dell'Architettura Futurista (Manifesto of Futurist Architecture) by Antonio Sant'Elia. The Italian group of architects Gruppo 7 (1926) embraced Rationalism and Modernism principles. After the dissolution of the group, its distinguished figures Giuseppe Terragni (Casa del Fascio, Como), Adalberto Libera (Villa Malaparte in Capri) and Giovanni Michelucci (Santa Maria Novella Station in Florence, in collaboration) emerged. During the Fascist period, the so-called \\"Novecento movement\\" flourished, with figures such as Gio Ponti, Peter Aschieri, Giovanni Muzio. This movement was based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome. Marcello Piacentini, who was responsible for the urban transformations of several cities in Italy, and remembered for the disputed Via della Conciliazione in Rome, devised a form of \\"simplified Neoclassicism\\". Fascism The period of time following the end of World War II was marked by several architectural talents, such as Luigi Moretti, Carlo Scarpa, Franco Albini, Gi√≤ Ponti, and Tomaso Buzzi, amongst others, who however lacked a single direction. Pier Luigi Nervi, for example, designed bold and concrete structures, and acquired an international reputation: his work influenced Riccardo Morandi and Sergio Musmeci. In a series of interesting debates, brought forward by critics such as Bruno Zevi, Rationalism prevailed, of which the Rome Termini Station can be said to be a paradigmatic work. The neorealism of Giovanni Michelucci (designer of numerous churches in Tuscany), Charles Aymonino, Mario Ridolfi and others (INA-Casa neighbourhoods) was followed by the Neoliberty style (seen in earlier works of Vittorio Gregotti) and Brutalist architecture (Torre Velasca in Milan group BBPR, a residential building via Piagentina in Florence, Leonardo Savioli and works by Giancarlo De Carlo). Modernism Carlo Scarpa executed many modernist projects throughout the Veneto region and particularly in Venice. Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright did not build anything in Italy, as opposed to Alvar Aalto (Santa Maria Assunta (Riola) Church of the Assumption in Riola, Vergato), Kenzo Tange (towers of Bologna Fair, the floor of Naples central business district (CDN)) and Oscar Niemeyer (home of Mondadori in Segrate). The Postmodern style in architecture, anticipated by Paolo Portoghesi around 1960, can be seen in the \\"Teatro del Mondo\\" (Theatre of the World) built by Aldo Rossi for the Venice Biennale of 1980. Rationalism also influenced Modernism in Italian architecture. Particularly, this design ethos reconciled the modern aesthetic ideals with religion, since this particular motif was not inimical to the priorities of the modern Italian architects. It gave rise to the so-called \\"secular- spirituality\\" ‚Äì an element in Italian modernism ‚Äì that focuses on the concept of enlightened rationalism. Another aspect of Italian modernism involves the diversity of interpretations with respect to how modernity is experienced. For example, the northern regions interpreted unornamented design as a rejection of culture and style. Post-modernism Parco della Musica in Rome, designed by Renzo Piano, 2016 Among the principal architects working in Italy between the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries were Renzo Piano (Stadio San Nicola in Bari, restructuring the Old Port of Genoa, Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, Padre Pio in San Giovanni Rotondo), Massimiliano Fuksas (skyscraper in the Piedmont region, Convention Center in the EUR), Gae Aulenti (the Railway Museum (Naples metro) of Naples underground), the Swiss Mario Botta (Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto, renovation of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan), Zaha Hadid (National Museum of the 21st Century Arts in Rome, skyscraper \\"Lo Storto\\" in Milan), Richard Meier (Church of God Merciful Father and the casket of the Ara Pacis, in Rome), Norman Foster (Campus Luigi Einaudi in Turin, and the Belfiore station in Florence), Daniel Libeskind (skyscraper \\"Il Curvo\\" in Milan) and Arata Isozaki (Palasport Olimpico in Turin, with Pier Paolo Maggiora and Marco Brizio, \\"Il Dritto\\" skyscraper in Milan). One of the prominent features of the postmodernist architecture in Italy can be identified as a reaction to modernism and to the fascist regime, which appropriated classical architectural forms and modernity. After these periods, there was an identifiable attempt to search for new design directions. Emergent works began to demonstrate atmospheres of nostalgia and memory. A group of young architects such as those who formed the group \\"La Tendenza\\" (e.g. Carlo Aymonino, Giorgio Grassi and Aldo Rossi) began to explore the question of memory and the glory of the Italian past, integrating their motifs in their works as physical presence and poetic content. They endeavored to expose the weaknesses of modernism, such as their critique of urbanism.

The indirect oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an aldehyde hydrate (R-CH(OH)2) by reaction with water. The oxidation of a primary alcohol at the aldehyde level is possible by performing the reaction in absence of water, so that no aldehyde hydrate can be formed. Oxidation to aldehydes Oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones Oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is partial oxidation; aldehydes are further oxidized to carboxylic acids. Conditions required for making aldehydes are heat and distillation. In aldehyde formation, the temperature of the reaction should be kept above the boiling point of the aldehyde and below the boiling point of the alcohol. Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones. These include: *Chromium-based reagents, such as Collins reagent (CrO3¬∑Py2), PDC or PCC. *Sulfonium species known as \\"activated DMSO\\" which can result from reaction of DMSO with electrophiles, such as oxalyl chloride (Swern oxidation), a carbodiimide (Pfitzner-Moffatt oxidation) or the complex SO3¬∑Py (Parikh-Doering oxidation). *Hypervalent iodine compounds, such as Dess-Martin periodinane or 2-Iodoxybenzoic acid. *Catalytic TPAP in presence of excess of NMO (Ley oxidation). *Catalytic TEMPO in presence of excess bleach (NaOCl) (Oxoammonium-catalyzed oxidation). *Catalytic Redox-active copper complex in the presence of oxygen at room temperature. Allylic and benzylic alcohols can be oxidized in presence of other alcohols using certain selective oxidants such as manganese dioxide (MnO2). Oxidation to ketones Reagents useful for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones, but normally inefficient for oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes, include chromium trioxide (CrO3) in a mixture of sulfuric acid and acetone (Jones oxidation) and certain ketones, such as cyclohexanone, in the presence of aluminium isopropoxide (Oppenauer oxidation). Another method is oxoammonium-catalyzed oxidation. Additionally, sodium hypochlorite (or household bleach) in acetone has been reported for efficient conversion of secondary alcohols in the presence of primary alcohols (Stevens oxidation). Oxidation to carboxylic acids Oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using *Potassium permanganate (KMnO4); *Jones oxidation; *PDC in DMF; *Heyns oxidation; *Ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4); *or TEMPO. Diol oxidation Oxidative breakage of carbon-carbon bond in 1,2-diols Alcohols possessing two hydroxy groups located on adjacent carbons ‚Äîthat is, 1,2-diols‚Äî suffer oxidative breakage at a carbon-carbon bond with some oxidants such as sodium periodate (NaIO4) or lead tetraacetate (Pb(OAc)4), resulting in generation of two carbonyl groups.

It is located in the city's west end, just west of Lansdowne Avenue. The area is a triangle surrounded on all three sides by railway lines: the CNR/CPR mainline to the west, Metrolinx GO Transit Barrie line to the east, and the CPR east-west railway lines to the north. Bloor Street cuts across the middle of the neighbourhood, Dupont Street runs close to the northern edge, and Dundas Street is close to the southern boundary. By some accounts, the recent residential developments of Davenport Village and Foundry Lofts, built on former factory lands north of the CP Rail line, west of Lansdowne, south of Davenport and east of the GO Transit Bradford/Newmarket/Barrie line, also belong in this neighbourhood. Name For a long time there was no agreed upon name for the area, generically referred to as West Toronto, others considered parts Bloordale Village, north of Dupont west of present-day Campbell had old factories considered within boundaries of The Junction and West Toronto Junction, yet other parts of area remained officially unnamed. In 2009, an effort was launched by locals in the community to find a name. \\"Junction Triangle\\" had been used by the city for the area since the 1970s. For demographics purposes the area is part of the Dovercourt-Wallace-Emerson-Junction district. A local residents association was called the South Junction Triangle Residents Association. One issue is that it is based on the nearby and much better known neighbourhood The Junction, and leads to frequent confusion. The area was also never part of the historic town of West Toronto Junction, but was called the Town of West Toronto, before annexation.\\"It's all in the name for this gritty 'hood; Choosing a moniker a 'fun way' to define west-end community\\". Mary Ormsby, Toronto Star, Feb 27, 2010. pg. GT.3 The Fuzzy Boundaries project was created to try to find a new name. A vote was held in March 2010. Some 230 options were submitted originally, and after a narrowing process the vote was between ten options. The final vote was: *Junction Triangle - 46.6% *Perth Park (after the park at the centre of the area) - 27.6% *Black Oak Triangle (after the Eastern Black oaks that covered the area before settlers arrived) - 26.0% *East Junction - 25.8% *The Wedge - 25.5% *The Triangle - 25.2% *Railtown - 23.7% *Railpath (after the West Toronto Railpath) - 23.4% *Rail District - 23.0% *South Junction Triangle - 22.7% History Historically the area was a centre for industry. The thin wedge of the triangle south of Bloor Street was almost entirely industrial lands, and industrial areas also lined the railway tracks that surround the neighbourhood. Factories made paint, ceramics, and chemicals in the area. The Ontario Stock Yards were also nearby. The area became home to the workers in the factories; by the 1950s this was a multicultural group of mainly Italian, Polish, and Macedonian immigrants. Later, the area became predominantly Portuguese with mass immigration from the Azores and the exodus of better-off Italian families to the northern suburbs of Woodbridge and Vaughan. Warehouses next to Bloor GO Station in Junction Triangle. The area was historically an industrial area. Beginning in the 1970s, local residents became concerned by pollution in the area. The proximity of homes and schools to heavy industry led to a long battle between residents and factory owners. The fumes from the plants were clearly detectable, and studies found elevated levels of a number of organic chemicals in the area's air. In July 1988 an explosion at a glue factory showered the neighbourhood with a yellow chemical rain.\\"Junction group leaves meeting: Residents want old factories moved.\\" Lile Sarick. The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ont.: Jul 29, 1988. pg. A.13 Residents blamed a series of ailments on the pollution, though studies found that cancer rates were normal.\\"Study belies fear in Junction Triangle.\\" Paul Taylor. The Globe and Mail. Oct 8, 1986. pg. A.14 Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, located in a re-purposed textile factory. Junction Triangle saw a number of factories move from the area in the 1990s. In response, the city and other levels of government began fining firms that violated environmental regulations, and zoning restrictions were put in place to prevent factories from expanding. Beginning in the 1990s these policies, combined with the general deindustrialization of North America, saw many of the factories in the area close, especially the most polluting ones. Former plants have been converted to lofts, and others have been demolished, leaving large brownfields. Some major factories do remain, notably the Nestl√© factory at 72 Sterling Road (second largest Smarties production facility outside of Germany) that some days gives a strong chocolate smell to the area. The character of the neighbourhood has also started to change, as increasingly young downtown professionals taking full advantage of the area's multitude of public-transit and other social amenities (cycling paths) are replacing the retired factory workers of previous years. However, Portuguese community influence remains strong, and to a lesser extent Italian. The character of the area is gaining in popularity as more young families discover this neighbourhood tucked between more well-known areas as Roncesvalles and Brockton. The area is attracting a lot of attention as a hidden gem with artists and other creative types, young professionals and first time buyers looking for a family-friendly area, close to the subway and other rapid- transit and within walking distance to other more established shopping areas. It's been considered 'Junction Triange the next Liberty Village' but concluded it's much more family friendly with a large portion of family homes to balance the future brownfield developments that are rapidly coming, the area residents are very actively involved with the planning processes to ensure the charm of area remains with the influx of development. Demographics Census tract 0098.00 of the 2006 Canadian census overlaps exactly with the residential portion of Junction Triangle. According to that census, the neighbourhood has 6,666 residents. Average income is 28,067, a good deal below the Toronto average. The ten most common language spoken at home are: *English - 65.0% *Portuguese - 13.0% *Spanish - 4.8% *Vietnamese - 3.5% *Cantonese - 2.5% *Italian - 2.1% *Greek - 0.9% *French - 0.7% *Gujarati - 0.7% *Polish - 0.5% Recreation The West Toronto Railpath is a multi-use asphalt trail that runs through the western edge of Junction Triangle. Ward 18 contains Campbell Park and Campbell Rink located just west of Lansdowne, north of Wallace at 255 Campbell Avenue. The Rink has a single pad, and is one of several outdoor compressor-cooled rinks in Toronto, with programming provided through Toronto's Parks and Recreation department. There is a clubhouse with a community kitchen, pay-what-you-can snack bar run by city staff, a skating lending program. In spring the park has community events including community campfires run by staff during the skating season, and in the summer local children can use the wading pool with qualified staff providing first aid. The West Toronto Railpath presently runs through the Junction Triangle and GO Transit is about to start the construction of a MobilityHub at Bloor St and the western border of neighbourhood. Toronto Life magazine has named this extended area one BuyNow neighbourhood due to its price affordability and proximity to downtown & transit.\\"Junction area residents fret as housing replaces factories;\\" Paul Moloney Toronto Star.

Ardeer was a small town now officially incorporated into Stevenston on the Ardeer peninsula, in the parish of Stevenston, North Ayrshire, originally an island and later its extensive sand dune system became the site of Nobel Explosives, a dominant global supplier of explosives to the mining and quarrying industries and a major player in the design and development of products for the chemical and defence industries during the 20th century. The peninsula is now part of North Ayrshire's most important area for Biodiversity. Geography=Ardeer Island Ardeer was once an island with a sea channel running along to exit in the vicinity of Auchenharvie Academy. Blaeu's map of 1654, based on Timothy Ponts map of circa 1600 clearly shows a small island with the settlements of Ardeer, Dubbs, Bogend, Longford, Snodgrass, Lugton Mill and Bartonholm all being on or near the coastline. The island was small and extended no further than Bartonholm, nowhere near the size of the present-day Ardeer peninsula.

It was at around this time that the old harbour at Seagatefoot was finally abandoned a new harbour built at Fullarton in 1665Close, Page 55 and the extreme sand movements recorded in relation to the old harbour may have also choked the sea channel that had made Ardeer an island. A map of 1872 shows a sizeable island at the tip of the Ardeer peninsula that included the site of the present day Big Idea complex. This island is not recorded on the later Ordnance Survey maps and was therefore of a transient nature due to the shifting sands, storm derived blow outs, etc. typical of large sand dune and estuary systems.Facebook Article Retrieved: 3013-09-27 As late as 1902 it was recorded that \\"Within recent years a number of little lochs, or dubbs, existed between Kilwinning and Stevenston, the memory of which, at least, has been preserved in the name of Dubbs Farm.\\"Wallace, Page 3 Ardeer House, Castlehill, Bartonholm, and Bogside were on the coast.

The one time owner of the Ardeer estate, Patrick Warner, had picked up skills in land reclamation during his exile in Holland and in the late 17th century his first act was to drain the line of bogs or dubs by cutting the Master Gott or ditch,Clements, Page 41 and this drainage system was later partly incorporated into the Stevenston Canal that ran up to Dubbs.Clements, Page 27Photobucket Retrieved : 2013-04-23 The Peninsula houses the remains of The Big Idea, a museum which operated from 2000 to 2003 celebrating Scottish Inventions and inventors. It has remained abandoned since its closure in summer 2003. History=Legends A legend tells of Saint Winning sending his monks to fish in the River Garnock, however no matter how hard they tried or how long they persevered they could catch nothing. Saint Winning in response to the river's perversity placed a curse on the river, preventing it from ever having fish in its waters; the river responded by changing course and thereby avoiding the curse. It is clear that the river has substantially changed its course in recorded history, previously having entered the sea at Stevenston.Billings, Page 1 Robin Campbell tells a story of the murder of the Earl of Eglinton's wife on Ardeer by Nigellus, the Abbott of Kilwinning Abbey in the 16th century. Pilgrims came to Kilwinning Abbey partly because of the miracles that were performed there and the Earl of Eglinton, a follower of John Knox, strongly voiced his disbelief and also stated that he would stop paying tithes to the monks. In revenge the abbott arranged for the Countess of Eglinton to be waylaid on her customary journey to Ardrossan by way of Ardeer. The monks took her to a ruined bothy, below which was a stone lined cellar; she was imprisoned here and starved to death. The earl was never able to find her, although her drowned servant was discovered on the beach and tales of the screams of a woman's voice hidden in the crashing of the waves at Ardeer and of a distressed woman who vanished when approached began to spread. After the earl had died the last monk of Kilwinning Abbey is said to have confessed to his part in this awful crime and thereby revealed the truth behind the unexplained disappearance of the Countess of Eglinton. Archaeology ;Pre-history A number of artifacts have been recovered from the Ardeer peninsula, including 54 flint arrowheads; 167 scrapers; 24 knives; a Late Bronze Age socketed gouge; part of a Bronze Age bead; a flat bead of dark blue glass; shale rings, armlets etc.; 2 Romano- British Brooches; a bronze pin and the head of a second; an early 10th- century, 'Whitby' type Anglo-Saxon bronze strap end; a probably 14th-century bronze ring brooch.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2012-08-16 In 1906, drifting of sand revealed a small oval cairn about in size and high in the centre, composed of about eighty water-rolled boulders. This covered at least sixteen cinerary urns, mainly bucket-shaped. The site was destroyed by building works at the Nobel site.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2012-08-16 A crannog site is located between Todhills Farm and the site of Bogend Farm.OS Map Retrieved : 2012-08-16 An area known as 'Snap Green', flooded at high spring tides, is shown near the tip of the peninsula in 1856. Extensive areas of saltings are shown to have existed at Misk in the 19th century. The movement of the sands onto the island of Ardeer must have been relatively rapid as records show that quarrying and mining at Misk Colliery exposed rich alluvial soil at Ardeer with clear signs of ploughing and artifacts such as earthenware and even a tobacco pipe that dates the ploughing to no earlier than the mid-16th century when tobacco was first introduced.Paterson, Page 557 ;The Castle Hill Timothy Pont refers to the sand dunes as Knoppes and he states that at one time a substantial castle was located here upon a large dune or mole of earth, still known in his time as Castle Hill. It is debated whether or not he was actually referring to the well known Castle Hill that lies inland.Dobie, page 53 Robin Campbell tells a tale of the House of Ardeer that was situated on the Ardeer sands and was built by the 'Picts', carrying the stones across from the 'mainland.' The buildings are said to have been destroyed by a huge storm, brought down upon the sands by the wife of the farmer at Misk when he was drowned in the nearby bog. By the 18th century only the remains of a dovecot and a few windblown trees are said to have survived.Service, Pages 249-256 Ardeer House This property, previously Dovecothall, was located at Stevenston, close to the site of the old Piperheugh hamlet. One of the most distinguished owners was the covenanter Patrick Warner, a minister who was forced to escape to Holland after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge.Paterson, Page 573Paterson, Page 571 It once stood on the coast and is said to have been a favourite anchorage ground, anchors having been found at various points inland. A sea-washed cave is located a little behind the house. The Stevenston Ironworks In 1849 the Glengarnock Iron Company built five blast furnaces on the foreshore of the Ardeer sands to smelt pig-iron. The iron ore was imported through Ardrossan harbour and to reduce costs Merry and Cunningham Ltd., successors to the Glengarnock company, started to build a quay by dumping slag into the sea. After 300 yards of these works had been completed it became obvious that no ship could safely dock here given the force of winter storms. The quay was abandoned and to this day it is known as the 'old pier' or 'slag point'. The works closed in 1931 and were demolished in 1935.Clements, Page 83 Coal Pits The West Field coal pits largely lay within the present-day Ardeer Park. In circa 1800 the pits were named Raise, Dip, First East, Crank, Stair, Second East, Old Engine, Bowbridge, and Bridge Shank. These were served by the Stevenston Canal, many with their own dedicated branches.Graham, Page 9 Nobel Explosives plant The Ardeer peninsula was the site of a massive dynamite manufacturing plant built by Alfred Bernhard Nobel. Having scoured the country for a remote location to establish his explosive factory, Nobel finally acquired from the Earl of Eglinton, and established the British Dynamite Factory in 1871, and went on to create what was described then as the largest explosives factory in the world. The factory had its own jetty on the River Garnock in Irvine Harbour serving ships disposing of time expired explosives or importing materials for the works. At its peak, the site employed almost 13,000 workers in a fairly remote location and had its own railway station. The station was used solely for workers and those special visitors with business in the ICI plant, and was never a regular passenger stop. Until the mid-1960s, there were two trains per day to transport workers. Although the line no longer exists, the abandoned platform remains, hidden beneath dense undergrowth. Its first Manager was George McRoberts FRSE and other notable staff included Edwin Mervyn Patterson who was Manager from 1954 to 1982. Transport=Canals The Master Gott (drain) from the Ardeer Roadbridge The Stevenston Canal of 1772 was the first commercial canal in Scotland. The canal was just over two miles long, had no locks, was twelve feet wide and had a depth of four feet, with much of its cut following the old course of the River Garnock, a relic of the days when Ardeer was an island. The Master Gott or drain is thought to be the last remaining vestige. Coal was carried on barges and the waste was dumped along the route to act as a wind break, blown sand being a recurring problem.Clements, Page 15 The water supply came from a dam on the Stevenston Burn. The Ardeer Quarry that produced Stevenston Stone exported to Ireland from Saltcoats Harbour almost certainly used the canal for transporting its stone output. A 1798 plan of the Stevenston Coaliery shows a Misk Canal of around a mile long running west and then north into the Misk Coalfield from the River Garnock. Railways In 1840 a station opened at Ardeer, named Stevenston, on the line travelling from Ardrossan to Glasgow. A railway station, Ardeer Platform, was also built, just south of the town, serving the large numbers of Nobel factory workers; it closed in 1966. By 1836 a horse-drawn wagon way had been built from Saltcoats down to the Bowbridge Pit and others in the area that is now the Ardeer Park.Graham, Page 31 Sport=Ardeer Golf Club The ICI land used to be home to Ardeer golf club. The original course was 9 holes in the Sandyhills area of Stevenston. Although the course has since long gone the original red sandstone clubhouse remains. The club then relocated to the Ardeer area of Stevenston, with the new course opening on 8 April 1905. This course was a true seaside links laid out in the stretch of dunes between the town and the sea on land owned by the Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI). ICI was where the club drew most of its membership, including Hamilton McInally, the Scottish Amateur champion of 1937, 1939 & 1947\\\\. Jackie Cannon was a member prior to winning the Scottish amateur championship in 1969 at the age of 52, the oldest winner ever. During the Second World War three of the holes were taken over by ICI for war duty and became a barrage balloon station. The three holes were restored after the war ensuring that the course was as good a test as it ever was. This was not to be the resting place of the Ardeer course because in the early sixties the membership were dealt a major blow when officials of the club were called to the headquarters of the Nobel Division of ICI. The clubhouse and the land which contained the golf course were required for the construction of a new factory for the manufacture of salts for use in the nylon industry. The club had no option on the matter as ICI owned the land. After several general meetings, it was decided that Lochend was where Ardeer Golf Course was to be reborn. Continual improvements have been ongoing in the last 38 years to take the course to what it is today by the strenuous efforts of both the members and green staff. Drainage has been improved over the years ensuring all year-round golf. There is a combination of mature and young trees of all varieties lining the fairways and full use has been made of the two burns which meander through the course. Ongoing improvements to teeing areas, greens and course in general means that the history is still in the making. Other sports The 1895 25 inch OS map shows a rifle range on the peninsula with targets set at 100-yard intervals and a magazine. In 1908 a cricket ground and pavilion are shown in the old golf course area.6 inch OS Map Retrieved: 2012-08-16 Education=Schools Ardeer Primary School was opened in August 1982. The school is located in the Ardeer Area of Stevenston in Clark Crescent and serves ages 5 to 11 in a primary school and a nursery class. The Old Ardeer Primary School sat on Garven Road, before closing in late 1981. Culture=Parish church In the heart of Ardeer is the Shore Road Ardeer Parish which was officially opened on Friday, 14 June 1895, the dedicatory service being conducted by the Rev. Alexander Robertson McEwan. Rev Andrew Morris Moodie‚Äôs first sermon in the new church was to the children, significantly enough, on the afternoon of Sunday, 16 June 1895. It is early 20th-century red sandstone Gothic building in the perpendicular style, designed by John Bennie Wilson. Perpendicular Gothic, it has an octagonal two-stage tower, with corbelled shafts at the angles to the upper stage flanking bipartite belfrey louvred lights; the parapet has battlements and truncated pinnacles are located at the angles. Ardeer church currently has 2 ministers; Rev John Lafferty and Rev David Hebenton who are shared between Ardeer and their linked church, Livingstone Parish Church, just a short distance away. Nudist beach Ardeer is also home to the only official naturist beach (located at ) on the south west Scottish mainland.  Wildlife on Ardeer peninsula.  Before industrialisation began in the late 19th Century the peninsula consisted mainly of one very large mobile dune system bordered by a sandy beach on the west and salt marsh and mud flats beside the R. Garnock on the east.. An early reference to \\"Ardeer Hills\\" in 1775 suggests the large size of many of the dunes. Although the development of Nobel's (and later ICI) explosives factory led to the stabilisation and re-contouring of extensive areas, the demands of the business (requiring distancing of units for safety reasons) allowed the general nature of the area to be retained. In recent decades, sand extraction has resulted in the loss of 20ha of dunes but the southern half of the peninsula still retains much of its original character. When the peninsula was surveyed for North Ayrshire Council in 2015 it was found to be the best biodiversity site in North Ayrshire. Part of the peninsula is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (Bogside Flats). The peninsula also occupies an important position within an area that includes two nature reserves (Garnock Floods managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Bogside Reserve managed by the RSPB).  Habitats  The seaward side of the peninsula is constrained by a concrete sea wall built in 1926-1929. This has greatly reduced the mobility of the dunes but is breaking up in places, which could allow more mobility again. The sand dunes make up the bulk of the peninsula and remain semi-natural throughout most of the southern half. Most of this peninsula area is dominated by acid dune grassland with extensive areas of dune heath and Dune slack. On the East side of the peninsula lie the Salt marsh and Mudflats of the River Garnock estuary which form part of the Bogside Flats SSSI. Parts of the northern half of the peninsula were planted with conifers, mainly Corsican Pine (Pinus nigra) in the middle of the 20th Century. These plantations have been left largely untouched. The resulting over-mature pine forest is a rare habitat in southern Scotland and is particularly noteworthy in terms of its large quantities of dead wood. There has also been a significant amount of natural woodland regeneration in various places, consisting of birches (Betula spp.), willows (Salix spp.), Alder (Alnus glutinosa) and Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus).  Biodiversity  About 1500 species have been recorded at Ardeer of which two thirds are invertebrates, making it one of the most important sites for insects in Scotland. Of these the bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) are particularly noteworthy. Ardeer is thought to be the best site in Scotland for solitary bees and wasps, owing to the sandy substrate and profusion of wildflowers. Among the notable species are the Northern colletes (Colletes floralis) which has a mainly Hebridean distribution in Scotland and several species, such as the Hairy-saddled Colletes (Colletes fodiens) and Pale-jawed Spiny Digger Wasp (Oxybellus mandibularis) which are mainly southern in Britain and are found in few other sites in Scotland. Surveys of beetles at Ardeer have identified 341 species of which 22 are Nationally rare or scarce (Red Data Book, Nationally Rare/Scarce or Nationally Notable). Among these are the ground beetles Harpalus neglectus which was a first record for Scotland and Stenolophus mixtus which is a second Scottish record, plus the clown beetle Hypocaccus rugiceps for which Ardeer is the most northern recent record for Britain. Ardeer is also home to the impressive Minotaur Beetle,Typhaeus typhoeus, which has its Scottish stronghold in the dunes of Ardeer and Irvine. Ardeer holds Ayrshire's largest populations of Dark green fritillary and Grayling butterflies and a number of Nationally Scarce moths, including sand dune rarities such as Coast dart and Shore wainscot. Over 100 species of spider have been recorded at Ardeer with Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) being particularly prominent, with half of the species on the Scottish list present. Among these the Nationally Scarce dune specialist Xerolycosa miniata is particularly noteworthy, being mainly a southern species. Among the 122 species of birds recorded the Lesser Whitethroat is particularly noteworthy, as it is right at the NW extremity of its European distribution and Ardeer and the neighbouring East Garnock area holds the largest breeding population in Ayrshire. Other notable species recorded at the site include Hen harrier, Long-eared owl, Osprey and Snow bunting. During migration and winter the Garnock mudflats and estuary hold regionally important numbers of Wigeon, Greenshank and other wildfowl and waders.  Threats to wildlife  In the past the safety precautions associated with the explosives industry protected the habitats on the peninsula. However the area is now under threat from two sources. Firstly, a Special Development Order for the Ardeer area was granted by the UK government in 1953. This still allows developments to take place without the normal planning scrutiny which would be required elsewhere in Scotland. Secondly, government money has been granted under the Ayrshire Growth Deal which could lead to commercial, housing and recreational develpments around the Irvine/Garnock estuaries. This could result in very significant loss of habitats and hence many of the highly specialised species in them. References ;Notes ;Sources # Billings, Robert William (1901).

Smith, USN (Ret.), in command. The floating dry dock completed outfitting at Oakland and training at Tiburon, CA, between mid-June and late August. On 3 September, she was taken in tow for the voyage west. En route to the Marianas, the dry dock made layovers of ten and seven days respectively at Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok. She arrived at Guam on 24 October and reported for duty with Service Squadron 11 (ServRon 11). Not long thereafter, however, she was assigned temporarily to ServRon 10\\\\. During her more than eight months at Guam, ARD-26 repaired warships damaged in the Leyte, Luzon, and Okinawa campaigns. While carrying out that mission, she reported to several different organizational entities, including ServRon 12, ServRon 10, and Naval Operating Base (NOB), Guam. In the second week in July 1945, the floating dry dock was towed to the Ryukyus where she transported equipment between various locations around Okinawa and docked warships for repairs. Her duty at Okinawa lasted until mid-August at which time she headed back to the Marianas. ARD-26 resumed her repair duties at Guam on 22 August 1945 and remained so employed for the next 17 years. In the latter part of 1962, the dry dock was towed back to the west coast of the United States. She was placed out of service in October 1962 and was berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. ARD-26 did not remain inactive for long. Towed to the east coast in 1964, she underwent conversion to a medium auxiliary repair dry dock at Baltimore, Maryland by the Bethlehem Steel Corp. ARD-26 was named Alamogordo on 22 March 1965 and simultaneously redesignated ARDM-2. She was placed in service again on 3 August 1965. Alamogordo then moved south to Charleston, SC., where she became a support unit for Submarine Squadron 18 (SubRon 18). She continued to provide repair services to the boats of SubRon 18 at Charleston for more than two decades. After being taken out of service, Alamogordo was laid up at Fort Eustis, Virginia in the James River division of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 November 1993. On 18 December 2000, ex-Alamogordo was transferred to Ecuador under the Security Assistance Program.

The short form of the name Boyan used in Bulgaria is Bobi or Bobby (Bulgarian: –ë–æ–±–∏). Its female equivalent is Boyana (Bulgarian: –ë–æ—è–Ω–∞). In present days it is used as a given name in Bulgaria written as Boyan (Bulgarian: –ë–æ—è–Ω), and also in all countries of former Yugoslavia, mainly written as Bojan (Serbian and Macedonian: –ë–æ—ò–∞–Ω)/(Slovenian/Croatian: Bojan). The name is recorded in historical sources among the Bulgarians, Serbs, Macedonians, Czechs, Poles, and Russians.  Etymology  There is some discussion as to where the name Boyan comes from. It is generally accepted that it is derived from the word –±–æ–π- (boy-), which means \\"battle\\", and the suffix -–∞–Ω (-an) which is common in Bulgarian and Slavic names. Together, Boyan (–ë–æ—è–Ω) means \\"warrior\\" or \\"fighter\\". It is also considered as a possibility from the Turkic-Mongol word \\"Bayan\\" () meaning rich, wealth, of the khagan of Avars Bayan I (562-602), and of the Bulgars Batbayan (665‚Äì668); from the name of Bohemia, the area of modern Czech Republic, in Serbian as Bojka (White Serbia), where lived the Celtic tribe Boii; from the Celtic Bryan or Brian which shares spelling and meaning similarity. Therefore, according to the Celtic origin of the name Bryan or Brian, the Bulgarian and Slavic name Boyan or Bojan could have the meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"noble\\".

Resistance to Alexander the Great Some time before the Battle of Issus Sabaces left Egypt with his army to join Darius III in Syria and support him in his fight against Alexander the Great. When the Battle of Issus took place (November 333 BC) Alexander and his horsemen fought their way through the enemy troops until they came in close vicinity to Darius III, whose life was therefore threatened. Darius III was protected by the most noble Persians, among them also Sabaces, who was killed:Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri 2.11.8; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 17.34.5; Quintus Curtius Rufus, Historiae Alexandri Magni 3.11.10 and 4.1.28 The Persian king fled because he feared for his life; therefore the Macedonians won the battle. Successor Mazaces was probably the successor of Sabaces in Egypt, but because Sabaces had taken with him nearly all occupying forces, Mazaces was not able to organize military resistance against the Macedonians.

Before that, on 20 June 2005, Nokia published ScriptArts' two-player-capable adaptation of the game for the Nokia N-Gage. The game is a spin-off of the 1985 action role-playing game Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu. A worldwide release of the Microsoft Windows version was published by XSEED Games on 3 November 2016.  Story  N-Gage: *The player character is a hunter who has been hired by a small town named Marion Berck to find a missing girl named Momo who disappeared after King-Dragon attacked. Since King-Dragon's attack, the villagers have been plagued by mysterious deaths, dying crops, and monster attacks, which you must help with along journey to find Momo. PC version: *The player character is a dishonored knight hired by a scholar named Charlotte L. Wells to investigate the ruins of Harlech Island on her behalf. Almost as soon as he begins, however, he is mortally wounded by a mysterious warrior named Dvorak and must undergo a life- saving process which binds him to Harlech. He will now die if he ever leaves ‚Äì unless he can find the fabled Dragon Slayer sword, which is the only item capable of severing his ties with Harlech and giving him his life back.  Gameplay  N-Gage: * The gameplay was compared to other similar games like Diablo, The Legend of Zelda, and to an extent, Final Fantasy.Xanadu Next (Translation), MeriStation Players seek out enemies, and then rapidly press the attack button to attack them. Spells could also be cast with varying strengths by holding down the spell button, allowing you to cast more powerful spells, but allow the enemies to close in on you. *One unique quality the game had was allowing players to switch between two different classes per level, using \\"Guardians\\". On each level up, players were able to pick between playing as a spell-casting character, or a melee-fighting character. This was an interesting feature, but generally useless ‚Äì if you play as the melee character, you would gain points in Strength, which is useless to you as a spell-casting character, and if you play as a spell caster, you gain points in Magic, which is useless as a melee fighter. *Players were encouraged to play for long periods of time. Each group of enemies you cleared raised the experience point bonus from the next group by 1%. The longer a person played, the more experience they would get with each enemy killed. Reception The N-Gage version got mixed reviews, but the PC version got generally favourable reviews.

The RabbitMQ server program is written in the Erlang programming language and is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover. Client libraries to interface with the broker are available for all major programming languages. History Rabbit Technologies Ltd. originally developed RabbitMQ. Rabbit Technologies started as a joint venture between LShift and CohesiveFT in 2007, and was acquired in April 2010 by SpringSource, a division of VMware. The project became part of Pivotal Software in May 2013. The source code is released under the Mozilla Public License.

History MCTI was founded in 1944 by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation which leased the facilities to the State of Michigan in order to rehabilitate returning World War II veterans and other Michigan citizens. The property and facilities was deeded to the state of Michigan in 1947. In 1952, the Michigan Board of Education established as a state institution and named Michigan Veteran's Vocational School. The name changed in 1959 to Michigan Rehabilitation Institute and a 350-bed dormitory was constructed in 1964. The name was changed again in 1968 to State Technical Institute and Rehabilitation Center (STIRC) and, in 1971, the first female student was enrolled. 1974 saw the addition of a health and recreation complex, which features a library, gymnasium, Olympic-sized indoor swimming pool, weight room, archery range, and even a bowling alley. In 1995, the name was changed once again to Michigan Career and Technical Institute (MCTI), what it is known as today. The Pine Lake Family Center was built in 1999 providing housing and daycare for those with families attending MCTI. Academics The school is accredited by the North Central Association on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI), as well as the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). MCTI is operated under the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Campus The campus consists of one main building which contains the student dormitories, the majority of the classrooms, as well as the cafeteria and indoor leisure activities; and several smaller peripheral buildings which include the Grounds Maintenance classroom and the Pine Lake Apartments. The surrounding grounds features lakeside frontage, a baseball diamond, basketball court, tennis court and other outdoor fun time areas. Student life The students are represented by a student government consisting of the Student Council (representatives from each course), the Hall Senate (representatives from each residence hall, who also act in a role of Resident Advisors in other colleges), and the Student Court (which acts as a court of second instance). The Veterans League, though not a part of the Student Government, per se, is also very influential in student life. Approximately 500 students attend MCTI at any given time.

The case The appellee, Aldo Mario Bellei, was born in Italy to an Italian father and an American mother. He acquired U.S. citizenship by virtue of section 1993 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, which conferred citizenship upon any child born outside the United States of only one American parent (known as jus sanguinis). Bellei received several warnings from government officials that failure to fulfill the five- year residency requirement before age 28 could result in loss of his U.S. citizenship. In 1964, he received a letter informing him that his citizenship had been revoked under ¬ß 301(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Bellei challenged the constitutionality of this act. The three-judge District Court held the section unconstitutional, citing Afroyim v. Rusk, and Schneider v. Rusk. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, ruling against Bellei.

Service history ARD-29 was placed in service at San Diego, California on 1 July 1944 and was employed by the Navy at the Naval Repair Base at San Diego during the latter part of 1944 and the beginning of 1945. Early in 1945, the drydock began to receive modifications at the Kaiser Cargo yard at Richmond, California, in preparation for assignment to advanced bases in the Pacific. She was placed in commission on 23 June 1945, Lt. Hector Phillips, USNR, in command. ARD-29 visited Everett, Washington, for about a month before getting underway for the Central Pacific on 22 July. She stopped en route at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands to change tugs and then continued on to the Marianas on 24 August under tow by . The floating drydock arrived at Guam on 2 September and operated there and later at Okinawa until late in 1946 when she was transferred to Pearl Harbor. ARD-29 provided repair services to Pacific Fleet ships at Pearl Harbor until the beginning of 1959. At that time, she was towed back to Guam where she served out the last 12 years of her Navy career.

These symptoms, however, are not sufficient to be a major depressive episode or a hypomanic episode. Symptoms must last for more than one year in children and two years in adults. The cause of cyclothymia is unknown. Risk factors include a family history of bipolar disorder. Cyclothymia differs from bipolar in that major depression, mania, or hypomania have never occurred. Treatment is generally with counseling and mood stabilizers such as lithium. It is estimated that 0.4-1% of people have cyclothymia at some point in their life. Onset is typically in late childhood to early adulthood. Males and females are affected equally often.  Symptoms  People with cyclothymia experience both depressive phases and hypomanic phases (which are less severe than a full hypomanic episode). The depressive and manic symptoms in cyclothymia last for variable amounts of time due to the unstable and reactive nature of the disorder. The depressive phases are similar to major depressive disorder and are characterized by dulled thoughts and sensations and the lack of motivation for intellectual or social activities. Most people with cyclothymia are generally fatigued and tend to sleep frequently and for long periods of time. However, other people experience insomnia. Other symptoms of cyclothymic depression include indifference toward people or activities that used to be extremely important. Cyclothymic depression also leads to difficulty making decisions. In addition, people with this condition tend to be critical and complain easily. Suicidal thoughts are common, even in mild forms of cyclothymia. In the depressive state, people with cyclothymia also experience physical complaints including frequent headaches, tightness in the head and chest, an empty sensation in the head, weakness, weight loss, and hair loss. The distinguishing factor between typical depression and cyclothymic depression is that in cyclothymic depression, there are instances of hypomania. People with cyclothymia can switch from the depressive state to the hypomanic state without warning to them or others. The duration and frequency of phases is unpredictable. In the hypomanic state, people's thoughts become faster and they become more sociable and talkative. They may engage in spending sprees, spontaneous actions, have heightened self-esteem, and greater vanity. In contrast to a regular manic state that would be associated with bipolar I, symptoms in the hypomanic phase generally occur in a less severe form. Comorbidities Cyclothymia commonly occurs in conjunction with other disorders. Between 20-50 percent of people with depression, anxiety, and related disorders also have cyclothymia. When people with cyclothymia seek mental health resources it tends to be for symptoms of their comorbid condition rather than for their symptoms of cyclothymia. In children and adolescents, the most common comorbidities with cyclothymia are anxiety disorders, impulse control issues, eating disorders, and ADHD. In adults, cyclothymia also tends to be comorbid with impulse control issues. Sensation-seeking behaviors occur in hypomanic states. These often include gambling and compulsive sexuality in men, or compulsive buying and binge eating in women. In addition to sensation-related disorders, cyclothymia has also been associated with atypical depression. In one study, a connection was found between interpersonal sensitivity, mood reactivity (i.e., responding to actual or potential positive events with brighter mood), and cyclothymic mood swings, all of which are symptoms of atypical depression. Cyclothymia also tends to occur in conjunction with separation anxiety, where a person has anxiety as a result of separation from a caregiver, friend, or loved one. Other issues that tend to co-occur with cyclothymia include social anxiety, fear of rejection and a tendency toward hostility to those connected with past pain and rejection. People with cyclothymia tend to seek intense interpersonal relationships when in a hypomanic state and isolation when in a depressed state. This generally leads to short, tumultuous relationships.  Causes  The cause is unknown. Risk factors include a family history of bipolar disorder. First-degree relatives of people with cyclothymia have major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder more often than the general population. Substance-related disorders also may be at a higher risk within the family. First-degree relatives of a bipolar I individuals may have a higher risk of cyclothymic disorder than the general population. Diagnosis Cyclothymia is classified in DSM-5 as a subtype of bipolar disorder. The criteria are: # Periods of elevated mood and depressive symptoms for at least half the time during the last two years for adults and one year for children and teenagers. # Periods of stable moods last only two months at most. # Symptoms create significant problems in one or more areas of life. # Symptoms do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder, major depression, or another mental disorder. # Symptoms are not caused by substance use or a medical condition. The DSM-5 criteria for cyclothymia are restrictive according to some researchers. This affects the diagnosis of cyclothymia because fewer people get diagnosed than potentially could. This means that a person who has some symptoms of the disorder might not be able to get treatment because they do not meet all of the necessary criteria described in DSM-5. Furthermore, it also leads to more attention being placed on depression and other bipolar-spectrum disorders because if a person does not meet all the criteria for cyclothymia they are often given a depression or bipolar spectrum diagnosis. Improper diagnosis may lead some people with cyclothymia to be treated for a comorbid disorder rather than having their cyclothymic tendencies addressed. Cyclothymia is often not recognized by the affected individual or medical professionals due to its ostensibly mild symptoms. In addition, it is difficult to identify and classify. Due to disagreement and misconceptions among health and mental health professionals, cyclothymia is often diagnosed as \\"bipolar not otherwise specified\\". Cyclothymia is also often confused with borderline personality disorder due to their similar symptoms,Kaplan & Sadock‚Äôs Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry (2017), 13.1 Mood Disorders: Historical Introduction and Conceptual Overview => Dysthymia and Cyclothymia. \\"It is not always easy to demarcate full-blown syndromal episodes of depression and mania from their subthreshold counterparts commonly observed during the interepisodic periods. The subthreshold conditions appear to be fertile terrain for interpersonal conflicts and postaffective pathological character developments that may ravage the lives of patients and their families. In North America and some Western European countries many such patients end up being labeled with borderline personality disorder, which, unfortunately, often tends to obscure the affective origin of the presenting psychopathology.\\" especially in older adolescents and young adults. Most people with the disorder present in a depressive state, not realizing that their hypomanic states are abnormal. Mild manic episodes tend to be interpreted as part of the person's personality or simply a heightened mood. In addition, the disorder often manifests during childhood or adolescence, making it even more difficult for the person to distinguish between symptoms of the disorder and their personality. For example, people may think that they just suffer from mood swings and not realize that these are a result of a psychiatric condition. Management Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered potentially effective for people diagnosed with cyclothymia. Medication can be used in addition to behavioral approaches. However, mood stabilizers should be used before antidepressants, and if antidepressants are used they should be used with caution. Antidepressants are a concern due to the possibility of inducing hypomanic switches or rapid cycling. History In 1883, Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum identified a disorder characterized by recurring mood cycles. The disorder contained both melancholic and manic episodes that occurred in a milder form than in bipolar disorder.Commentary on Hecker and his work: New translation of Hecker's 1898 paper: This condition was coined \\"cyclothymia\\" by Kahlbaum and his student Ewald Hecker. Kahlbaum developed his theory of cyclothymia through his work with people presenting with these symptoms at the Kahlbaum Sanitarium in Goerlitz, Silesia (Germany). He was recognized as a leading hypnotherapist and psychotherapist of his day. He was a progressive in the field of mental health, believing that mental illness should not carry a stigma and that people dealing with mental health issues should be treated humanely. Kalhbaum was the first to recognize that people with cyclothymia often do not seek help for the disorder due to its mild symptoms. Cyclothymia has been conceptualized in a variety of ways, including as a subtype of bipolar disorder, a temperament, a personality trait, and a personality disorder. There is also an argument that cyclothymia should be considered a neurodevelopmental disorder. The two defining features of the disorder, according to DSM-5, are the presence of depressive and hypomanic symptoms, not meeting the threshold for a depressive or hypomanic episode. Cyclothymia is also classified as a subtype of bipolar disorder in DSM-5, but some researchers disagree with this classification and argue that it should be primarily defined as an exaggeration of mood and emotional instability. In the past, cyclothymia has been conceptualized to include other characteristics in addition to the flux between depression and hypomania, such as mood reactivity, impulsivity, and anxiety. Epidemiology Cyclothymia, known today as cyclothymic disorder, tends to be underdiagnosed due to its low intensity. The exact rates for cyclothymia have not been widely studied. Some studies estimate that between 5 and 8% are affected at some point in their life whereas other studies suggest a rate ranging from 0.4 to 2.5%. Males appear to be affected equally often, though women are more likely to receive treatment. Cyclothymia is diagnosed in around fifty percent of people with depression who are evaluated in psychiatric outpatient settings.  Etymology  Cyclothymia is derived from the Greek word Œ∫œÖŒ∫ŒªŒøŒ∏œÖŒºŒØŒ± (from Œ∫·ø¶Œ∫ŒªŒøœÇ kyklos, \\"circle\\"Œ∫œçŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and Œ∏œÖŒºœåœÇ thymos, \\"mood, emotion\\").Œ∏œÖŒºœåœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Therefore, it means \\"to cycle or circle between moods or emotions\\". Research Whether subtypes of bipolar disorder, such as cyclothymia, truly represent separate disorders or are part of a unique bipolar spectrum is debated in research. Cyclothymia is typically not described in research studies or diagnosed in clinical settings, making it less recognizable and less understood by professionals. This absence of cyclothymia in research and clinical settings suggests that cyclothymia is either being diagnosed as another mood disorder or as a non-affective psychiatric disorder or not coming to scientific or clinical attention due to a lack of diagnostic clarity or because the nature of cyclothymia is still highly contested. Additionally, the current diagnostic criterion for cyclothymia emphasizes that symptoms are persistent, which suggests that they are enduring traits rather than a psychological state, thus, it has been argued that it should be diagnosed as a personality disorder. Since the symptoms tend to overlap with personality disorders, the validity and distinction between these two diagnostic categories has been debated. Lastly, the tendency of cyclothymia to be comorbid with other mental disorders makes diagnosis difficult. These issues prevent consensus on the definition of cyclothymia and its relationship with other mental disorders among researchers and clinicians. This lack of consensus on an operational definition and symptom presentation is especially pronounced with children and adolescents because the diagnostic criteria have not been adequately adapted to take into account their developmental level. Society and culture Actor Stephen Fry has spoken about his experience with cyclothymia, which was depicted in the documentary Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive. Singer Charlene Soraia had cyclothymia and wrote a song about her experiences with the disorder.

Much of his activity centred on the farm Boschendal, which has given its name to the current Boschendal Estate. To this day it is a major source of employment for the local community. Location Close to Cape Town, between Stellenbosch, Pniel, Franschhoek and Paarl, Boschendal stretches between the foot of the Groot Drakenstein mountains to the Simonsberg mountains, with views of the mountain, vineyards and valley below.

The Western Cape wine farms had been devastated by a phylloxera epidemic in the 1880s & 1890s. Diseased vineyards were ploughed up and gradually replanted with vines grafted onto resistant American rootstock. In the meantime, farmers needed alternative forms of agriculture and the lucrative fruit industry in California provided a suitable model for the Cape. Pioneering work was done by fruit farmers in Wellington and the Hex River Valley. In 1892, shipping magnate Percy Molteno developed and introduced refrigerated cargo space on Union-Castle shipping lines, between the Cape and the largest consumer markets in Europe, which revolutionised the industry and made the export of fresh fruit an attractive proposition.Boschendal 2007.

Stander: Tree of Life, The Story of Cape Fruit. Cape Town: Saayman & Weber Ltd. 1983. Rhodes & Pickstone Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience growing fruit in California, landed in the Cape in 1892. He convinced Rhodes that a commercial nursery was needed to propagate new varieties of fruit trees for the industry. Rhodes financed his first venture, the Pioneer Fruit Growing Company. After retiring from politics in 1896 Rhodes decided to invest further in fruit farming. Pickstone advised him to buy old wine farms in the Groot Drakenstein, Wellington and Stellenbosch areas. In March 1897 Rhodes secured the first of more than 20 farms, including Boschendal and Rhone. Twelve young managers from South Africa, Britain and AmericaThe estate that Rhodes built, by Eric Lloyd Williams, published by Anglo American Corporation were appointed; many of them had been trained in California. Under Pickstone's tutelage they transformed the farms, introducing modern methods of pruning, grafting and irrigation, and training farm workers in the new skills. They planted 200,000 deciduous fruit trees ‚Äì pears, apricots, plums and peaches. This rapid expansion and Rhodes' use of his fortune to buy out smaller farmers led to some opposition. He was condemned for a \\"monopolistic\\" policy but rode out the storm.The estate that Rhodes built, by Eric Lloyd Williams, published by Anglo American Corporation Pickstone set up offices at Lekkerwijn where Rhodes, Kipling and others were visitors. Rhodes was keen to have his own retreat and commissioned Sir Herbert Baker to build him a simple cottage. Baker also designed two churches in the area and a village for workers at Languedoc. Anglo-Boer War Relations between Britain and the Boer republics deteriorated and led to the outbreak of war in 1899. Rhodes immediately left for Kimberley, the centre of his diamond interests and remained there during the four-month siege. He continued to attend to fruit farming matters and persuaded the mining magnate, Alfred Beit and De Beers to become shareholders, to ensure continuing financial strength for the project.The estate that Rhodes built, by Eric Lloyd Williams, published by Anglo American Corporation Rhodes's health deteriorated and on his return to the Cape he withdrew to his cottage in Muizenberg. In February 1902, as Rhodes was dying, a new company, Rhodes Fruit Farms Ltd, was born. The day before Rhodes died, Pickstone was appointed technical director to the company and resident director at Groot Drakenstein.The estate that Rhodes built, by Eric Lloyd Williams, published by Anglo American Corporation The De Beers era De Beers, Sir Alfred Beit and the Rhodes Estate became joint share-holders of Rhodes Fruit Farms with Dr Leander Starr Jameson (of Jameson Raid fame) was chairman. Pickstone ran the company for another two years before returning to his nursery business. By then the railway was extended to Groot Drakenstein and trains were fitted with refrigeration cars for the distribution of fruit. Rhodes Fruit Farms became the industry leader and a major source of employment locally. It opened a cannery in 1903 and a jam factory in 1906. After Sir Alfred Beit's death in 1906, De Beers bought Beit and Rhodes's shares. Returns were never high and in 1927 De Beers ordered an investigation into its fruit-farming operations. They appointed one of the consultants, Alfred Appleyard from the University of Bristol, as general manager. He held the position for 22 years and consolidated the company's holdings: selling off the Wellington farms and acquiring Excelsior and Bien Donn√© in Groot Drakenstein. Sir Abe Bailey In 1937 De Beers decided to sell Rhodes Fruit Farms and it was bought by Sir Abe Bailey, three years before his death. He was an old associate of Rhodes with gold-mining interests and had been involved in the Jameson Raid. During Bailey‚Äôs short interlude as owner, Appleyard remained in charge of the fruit farms and lived at Goede Hoop. Syndicate In 1941, a syndicate of businessmen bought Rhodes Fruit Farms from Bailey's estate. They were A.B. McDonald, E.J. Crean, S.T. Richards, G.H. Starck, and later Frank Robb. The Directors and their families spent many holidays at Rhodes Cottage. John Manning, the new general manager, built a new cannery in 1951, a sawmill in 1953 and purchased the farm, Bethlehem, in Groot Drakenstein. Rhodes Fruit Farms retained only one farm in Stellenbosch, namely Vredenburg. This was sold in the late 1960s and is now a suburb called Die Boord (Afrikaans : the orchard). Anglo-American Corporation In 1969, Frank Robb persuaded Anglo-American, De Beers and Rand Selection Corporation Ltd to become majority shareholders in Rhodes Fruit Farms. The company decided to restore Boschendal and revive wine farming under the Boschendal brand name. The complex was restored by the architect, Gawie Fagan, and opened to the public in 1976. The company changed its name to Anglo-American Farms. Anglo American started divesting itself of the cannery, dairy, piggeries and its fruit interests in the late 1990s, eventually selling off all the lands along the Berg and Dwars Rivers. Boschendal Ltd In 2004 a private consortium, under the leadership of property developer Clive Venning, bought Boschendal. The 600 hectare, 17th Century Boschendal Estate is sectioned into 18 Founders‚Äô Estates between 21 and 44 hectares each. The Goede Hoop Homestead, built by Pieter Hendrik de Villiers in 1821 graces ‚Äì Estate 17. On Estate 19 stands the historic Rhodes Cottage, designed and constructed in 1902 as a country retreat for mining magnate and empire builder by Sir Herbert Baker, the dominant force in South African architecture for two decades. Boschendal The Estate continues to be a major source of employment for local communities and the development of Boschendal will generate R 100 million for investment in the local community projects such as nutrition and health, education and skills development, agricultural, heritage and environmental support. The consortium has donated 270 hectares of land to the community trust.Boschendal 2007.

The gene that encodes the cereblon protein is found on the human chromosome 3, on the short arm at position p26.3 from base pair 3,190,676 to base pair 3,221,394. CRBN orthologs are highly conserved from plants to humans.  Clinical significance = Birth defects  The drug thalidomide binds to cereblon and changes which substrates can be degraded by it, which leads to an antiproliferative effect on myeloma cells and possibly the teratogenic effect on fetal development. Thalidomide was used as a treatment for morning sickness from 1957 until 1961 but was withdrawn from the market after it was discovered that it caused birth defects. It is estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 children were affected. However, the idea that cereblon modulation is responsible for the teratogenic activity of thalidomide in the chick and zebrafish was cast into doubt due to a 2013 report that pomalidomide (a more potent thalidomide analog) does not cause teratogenic effects in these same model systems even though it binds with cereblon more strongly than thalidomide. Intellectual disability Mutations in the CRBN gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability, possibly as a result of dysregulation of calcium-activated potassium channels in the brain (see below) during development.  Function = Ubiquitination and role in development  Cereblon forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), Cullin-4A (CUL4A), and regulator of cullins 1 (ROC1). This complex ubiquitinates a number of other proteins. Through a mechanism which has not been completely elucidated, this ubiquitination results in reduced levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). FGF8 in turn regulates a number of developmental processes, such as limb and auditory vesicle formation. The net result is that this ubiquitin ligase complex is important for limb outgrowth in embryos. In the absence of cereblon, DDB1 forms a complex with DDB2 that functions as a DNA damage- binding protein. Furthermore, cereblon and DDB2 bind to DDB1 in a competitive manner.  Regulation of potassium channels  Cereblon binds to the large- conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (KCNMA1) and regulates its activity. Moreover, mice lacking this channel develop neurological disorders.

The committee noted: 46\\\\. It became clear in the course of our inquiry into EU-Russia relations that the current confrontation is driven both by Russian domestic and political considerations and the geopolitical ambitions of the current Russian administration. Even a settlement in Ukraine will not guarantee that the Union will be able return to harmonious relations with Russia. Therefore, the future of EU-Russia relations, the security of neighbours such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, as well as the long-term alignment of countries such as Azerbaijan and Armenia‚Äîneither of which, in the words of Professor Elena Korosteleva, Mr Igor Merheim-Eyre, Ms Eske Van Gils and Ms Irena Mnatsakanyan, Global Europe Centre, University of Kent, ‚Äúenjoys very close relations with the EU‚Äù‚Äîremain in the balance. Widening the European dialogue in Moldova Korosteleva was commissioned by the Slovak Atlantic Commission as principal investigators to undertake a nationwide representative survey in Moldova between 19 October and 7 November 2013 aimed at measuring public knowledge, perceptions and preferences in relation to the EU and its policies. The key findings suggest public support of the EU and its policies has slightly eroded, which is reflected in the respondents' perceptions, levels of interest, attitudes and behavioural preferences. The EU remains attractive for Moldova ‚Äì but is not a default option yet. It requires continuous reinforcement: the fear of uncertainty and negative anticipations of change currently prevail in public perceptions of the EU, causing a loss of trust, and reciprocity in EU-Moldova relations. The Eurasian Customs Union (ECU), on the contrary, tends to be seen as a model which may potentially offer a quick- fix solution for stability, prosperity and security Belarus and Eastern Partnership: National and European values Korosteleva was commissioned by the Office for Democratic Belarus as principal investigators to undertake a nationwide representative survey in Belarus between 20 May and 4 June 2013 focusing on the country's relations with the EU and the (Eurasian) Customs Union (ECU); as well as public perceptions, values, and attitudes towards the afore-mentioned entities. Three particular trends are observable in Belarus's public relations: * Comparative trends demonstrate a positive and substantive shift in public attitudes towards the EU; reflected in higher levels of awareness, more knowledge about EU structures and policies, more interest in EU affairs, more perceivable commonalities with the EU as a polity, more appreciation of EU support, and most importantly, identity-based preferences developing in relation to the latter. * At the same time, normative underpinnings of public behaviour remain firmly rooted in cultural traditions and historical legacies of the past. * Levels of awareness about the (Eurasian) Customs Union (ECU) are relatively high (90%). Importantly, the majority of respondents see the ECU as more relevant in addressing immediate economic and energy security concerns. European External Action Service (EEAS) Korosteleva's evidence, submitted to the United Kingdom House of Lords European Union Committee was cited in the report on the European External Action Service.House of Lords, European Union Committee, The EU's External Action Service Report, The Stationery Office Limited, 19 March 2013, 52‚Äì59. The committee noted: 52\\\\. Professor Elena Korosteleva (University of Kent) has studied Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, three of the Eastern Partnership countries. She had observed that the EEAS could be beneficial both as a global force and for overcoming divisions in government and institutions, but thought that a number of management problems needed to be addressed to achieve coherence and continuity in competences at the lower levels of the EEAS, especially in delegations. She also advocated a clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities in relation to Member States and efforts to engage with host countries. Structural reform was needed to replace divided structures, loyalties and competences by \\"collective service to the common good.\\" European Neighbourhood Policy Research and Eastern Partnership Initiative Research (ENP\\\\EaP Research) Korosteleva's primary research focus is on the conceptual and methodological limitations of the Eastern Partnership initiative, especially concerning the notion of partnership, as the focal point of the initiative. Through a major ESRC research project she examines the EU's relations with Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova in contrast to the international relations approach adopted by Russia. She notes that the top- down EU-centric governance approach (based on EU rule and norm transfer) clashes with the notion of partnership, which is based on reciprocal exchange and co-operation on issues of mutual interest. Korosteleva's research of the existing EU practices in Eastern Europe has so far revealed two-level tensions. First, from the examination of official documents, elite interviews and public surveys across the EU border, it has transpired that conceptually the EU has limited uniform awareness of what it is trying to promote in its eastern neighbourhood under the aegis of 'shared values', 'collective norms' and 'joint ownership'. Not only is there a discrepancy in the EU's own rhetoric ‚Äì juxtaposing its 'universalist' values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law (Europeanisation), with its 'realist' security 'needs' to protect its borders and safeguard its own citizenry (securitisation); there is also an evident clash of the EU's vision of good governance with what the neighbours perceive to be such, stemming from their own unique historical experiences and cultural traditions. Second, empirically, the EU seems to favour a 'top-down' governance approach (based on rule/norm transfer and conditionality) in its relations with outsiders, which is clearly at odds with a voluntary idea of 'partnership', and explicitly limits the input of 'the other' in the process of reform. In the absence of a workable notion of partnership, external governance (unintentionally) circumscribes the EU's actions to the EU-centred vision of governance, without necessarily connecting it to the 'visions' and 'needs' of the partner states. Consequently, without the substantive knowledge of its partners, the EU encounters protraction even from the most 'enthusiastic' neighbours, such as Moldova and Ukraine; and resistance from those who are not sufficiently motivated by the 'universal' appeal of EU governance. Research outputs Korosteleva's The European Union and its Eastern Neighbours: Towards a more ambitious partnership? (2012) explores the EU's relations with its eastern neighbours. Based on the extensive original research ‚Äì including surveys, focus-groups, a study of school essays and in-depth interviews with key people in Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Russia and in Brussels ‚Äì it assesses why the EU's initiatives have received limited legitimacy in the neighbourhood has been so poorly received. The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) of 2004, and the subsequent Eastern Partnership (EaP) of 2009 heralded a new form of relations with the EU's neighbours ‚Äì partnership based on joint ownership and shared values ‚Äì which would complement if not entirely replace the EU's traditional governance framework used for enlargement. These initiatives, however, have received a mixed response from the EU's eastern neighbours. It shows how the key elements of \\"partnership\\" have been forged mainly by the EU, rather than jointly, and examines the idea and application of external governance, and how this has been over-prescriptive and confusing. Korosteleva's second major publication from this research is an edited volume entitled Eastern Partnership: A New Opportunity for the Neighbours? (2011). This book, written in partnership with in country experts, offers a collective assessment of the development and impact of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership Initiative on its eastern neighbours ‚Äì Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova in particular, with Russia's added perspective. The volume uniquely bridges the perspectives of all parties across the EU's eastern border, in an attempt to understand advantages and problems related to the effective implementation of the EU policies in the eastern region. The undertaken research points to the prevalence of the top-down and conditional governance approach in EU treatment of the outsiders, which is not only Eurocentric and prescriptive in nature, but also falls short of the declared partnership principles. Without the understanding of partners' internal dilemmas and needs, which could only be achieved through the equivalence and reciprocity of partnership, the EU would struggle to make the policy effective and legitimate in the region, and to buttress its reputation as a 'credible force for good' on the international arena. 'The Quality of Democracy' Korosteleva working with Derek Hutcheson (eds) explore how the countries of the former Eastern Bloc and Soviet Union have exhibited remarkable diversity in their post-communist regime paths in The Quality of Democracy in Post-Communist Europe (2005). They argue that whereas some states have become demonstrably more democratic and have moved in the space of fifteen years from the periphery to the centre of European politics, in others the political and economic climates seem hardly to be better, and their societies no more free, than in the final years of the Cold War. Assessing progress towards democracy in the former Eastern Bloc ‚Äì or the lack of it ‚Äì requires a qualitative examination of post-communist polities. This research brings together a number of perspectives, both macro and micro- analytical, on the 'quality' of democracy in post-communist Europe. Belarusian politics Korosteleva with Colin Lawson and Rosalind Marsh (eds) argue in Contemporary Belarus between Democracy and Dictatorship (2003) that Belarus is unique among the states of the former Soviet bloc, in that after a decade of transition', the country remains stalled' and backward-oriented. Political and economic changes are characterised by half-measures, and recently a new suppression of dissent has been introduced; the country balances between the prospect of democracy and a retreat to authoritarianism. These developments contrast starkly with the many democratic changes in neighbouring states and suggest a possible alternative path for future development in Eastern Europe. Korosteleva provides a thorough overview of current developments in Belarus. It looks at historical, political, economic and social changes, and at international relations, especially relations with Russia and the European Union, considering all these factors both in their domestic and international contexts and defines the type of democracy, if any, which exists in Belarus, exploring the prospects for further democratisation. Korosteleva with Stephen White and John Lowenhardt (eds) continue the analysis of Belarusian politics in Post Communist Belarus (2005). They note that Belarus is one of the least studied European states to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In fact, few Western specialists paid much attention to its affairs during the Soviet era. Nevertheless, Belarus constitutes an important and sensitive border region between Russia and the western part of the continent. In Postcommunist Belarus, a stellar group of contributors examines the issues and the search for identity that Belarus has confronted in the period leading up to and following independence. The country is run in an authoritarian fashion by President Alexander Lukashenko and many observers, both inside and outside Belarus, would use the term \\"dictatorship\\" to describe his rule. Belarusian authorities prefer to emphasise the strong support of the people for the president and his cautious approach to economic reform. It seems unlikely that the country can hold out permanently against the wider pressures of democratisation and economic reform that are transforming its neighbours. The country's situation offers political scientists many facets for comparison with established models. Belarus is grappling with challenges that are conceptual and psychological as much as they are political, economic, and social.

Southern East Florida is not shown. The Baton Rouge and Mobile Districts of Spanish West Florida (red), claimed by the United States, spanned parts of three later states. The Spanish province also included part of the present state of Florida. Under Spanish rule, Florida was divided by the natural separation of the Suwannee River into West Florida and East Florida. (map: Carey & Lea, 1822) The Floridas was a region of the southeastern United States comprising the historical colonies of East Florida and West Florida. The borders of East and West Florida varied. In 1783, when Spain acquired West Florida and re- acquired East Florida from Great Britain through the Peace of Paris (1783), the eastern British boundary of West Florida was the Apalachicola River, but Spain in 1785 moved it eastward to the Suwannee River. The purpose was to transfer the military post at San Marcos (now St. Mark's) and the district of Apalachee from East Florida to West Florida. From 1810 to 1813, the United States extended piecemeal control over the part of West Florida that comprised the modern-day Gulf coasts of Alabama and Mississippi and the Florida Parishes of Louisiana. After the ratification of the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1821 the United States combined East Florida and what had been the remaining Spanish- controlled rump of West Florida into the territory that comprised modern-day Florida.

Best known for manufacturing vintage-style Filter‚Äôtron pickups. TV Jones pickups attempt to recreate the sound of vintage Gretsch guitars by using American- made materials and a manufacturing process similar to what was used in the late 1950s and 1960s by Gretsch. The company was founded in 1993 by guitarist and luthier Thomas V. Jones in Whittier, California. History Prior to the focus on guitar pickups TV Jones was mainly in the business of guitar repairs and custom guitar making. Jones had a long list of famous clients, from working several years at a repair shop in Long Beach, California called the World of Strings. Clients included Brian Setzer, Michael Anthony and others. After his stint at World of Strings, Jones opened his own shop and launched the TV Jones company where he continued to attract star clients like Joe Walsh and John Fogerty simply through word-of-mouth. In the early 1990s interest turned to electronics and Jones began to examine pickups and the magnets used in various vintage models. Around this time he was asked to repair a number of guitars for Stray Cats / BSO guitarist Brian Setzer, whose guitar sound relied heavily on vintage Gretsch guitars. When the Gretsch Guitar Company was in the process of creating a Brian Setzer signature model, Brian conducted a ‚Äúblind sound test‚Äù of various pickup models that were to be considered for use in these guitars. Tom's Hotrod pickup design was chosen because of its sound being the most faithful to the original. (At this point, the pickups Gretsch was using in their guitars were made of overseas parts and ceramic magnets). Notoriety Word soon spread that TV Jones was making ‚Äútrue-to-the-original‚Äù Filter‚Äôtron pickups and many famous players demanded their guitars be outfitted with TV Jones pickups. The guitar playing public (especially Gretsch aficionados) became aware of TV Jones pickups and the popularity grew as the company expanded its product line into the Magna‚ÄôTron, Power‚ÄôTron, Super‚ÄôTron and Thunder‚ÄôTron models. As of 2010 TV Jones has 8 different pickup models and is sold around the world.  Users *Jim Heath (TV Classics) *Brian Setzer (TV Classics) *Billy F.

Platted in the early 1890s as a residential area for Harriman's upper and professional classes, the neighborhood contains over 100 buildings added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as a historic district for their architectural and historical significance. The neighborhood is named for the home of Harriman founder Frederick Gates, which once stood near the eastern end of the district. Harriman was envisioned as a large-scale industrial center where the application of late 19th-century social reform principles, namely prohibition, would create an ideal living environment. The East Tennessee Land Company, led by Gates, designed the city in late 1889, including in the design several larger, more expensive lots in what is now Cornstalk Heights. Most of the district's earliest houses cost over $3,000 apiece, with some as high as $10,000-- enormous sums for the period. Throughout the 1890s and early 1900s, Harriman's affluent residents built dozens of Victorian homes, most of which are still standing. In 1990, the Cornstalk Heights Historical Community Organization was formed to prevent the district's Killeffer Park from being converted into a housing development. Location Cornstalk Heights is situated atop a low-rising ridge in the original section of Harriman, which is bordered by an oxbow bend in the Emory River on the north, east, and south, and by Walden Ridge on the west. The heights rise to a maximum of about above the rest of the city. The district is located along Cumberland, Clinton, and Trenton streets, which run north-to- south, and Walden, Crescent, Queen, and Virginia avenues, which run east-to- west. A narrow alleyway runs along the crest of the ridge between Clinton and Cumberland streets. The district consists of blocks 413-806 Clinton Street, 409-829 Cumberland Street, 502-702 Trenton Street, 418-503 Queen Avenue, 319 Virginia Avenue, and 330, 402-417, and 424-506 Walden Avenue. The neighborhood contains 110 houses, 100 of which are contributing properties in the National Register listing. Killeffer Park, located along Cumberland Street, is also a contributing property. Two churches in the district-- the First Presbyterian Church and the Open Bible Baptist Church-- were built in 1956 and 1985, respectively, and are non-contributing buildings due to age. The district's lone contributing commercial building is located at the corner of Walden Avenue and Clinton Street. History Eastlake-style Russell-Jackson House (525 Cumberland St.), believed to be the oldest house in Cornstalk Heights Before 1890, what is now Cornstalk Heights (and much of Harriman) was part of a large farm owned by Robert K. Byrd. That year, the East Tennessee Land Company, formed by northern Temperance activists led by Frederick Gates and General Clinton B. Fisk, purchased the land from Byrd's widow for $26,000. The company hoped to establish a large industrial center that would attract businesses, while at the same time demonstrate the benefits of barring the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages. On Christmas Day, 1889, the East Tennessee Land Company platted a section of Harriman that included most of what is now Cornstalk Heights. These lots were sold in late February 1890 at an auction attended by over 4,000 prospective buyers from across the country. In the Cornstalk Heights section, lots along Cumberland Street and the section of Walden Avenue between Cumberland and Clinton streets typically sold for over $2,000. Lots along Clinton Street typically sold for over $1,000.John Benhart, Appalachian Aspirations: The Geography of Urbanization and Development in the Upper Tennessee River Valley, 1865-1900 (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2007), pp. 63-70, 86, 91-98, 115-116. The deeds to these lots required that lot owners construct frame or brick houses with at least six rooms. Over the next two years, fourteen contractors began building homes in Cornstalk Heights, using primarily materials from new industries that had been established across town along the Emory River. The homes of Gates and Gates' successor as the East Tennessee Land Company's general manager, William H. Russell (1857-1911), were probably the earliest homes built in Cornstalk Heights. Gates' house was demolished in the 1950s, but Russell's house still stands at 525 Cumberland Street. Tudor Revival-style house built of native Crab Orchard stone in 1927 Although the East Tennessee Land Company went bankrupt in the wake of the Panic of 1893, it had succeeded in attracting enough new industry to help Harriman survive. Many of the heads of these new companies built homes in Cornstalk Heights. Henry Winslow, manager of the Harriman Land Company and Harriman's primary developer after the departure of the East Tennessee Land Company, built his house at 802 Clinton Street. David Gibson, owner of Gibson Agricultural Works, built at 403 Walden Avenue. V. G. Farnham, manager of the Harriman Tack Company, built at 813 Cumberland Street. S. K. Paige, owner of a lumber company, built the house now known as \\"Bushrod Hall\\" at 422 Cumberland Street. In the 1920s, Tom Tarwater-- manager of the Roane Hosiery Company-- built at 709 Cumberland Street. The Reverend Alexander Killeffer, a photographer for the East Tennessee Land Company, founded Harriman's St. Andrews Episcopal Church in the early 1890s, and helped build its original meeting house at 630 Trenton Street, where the Open Bible Baptist Church now stands. The original design of Harriman included a park along Cumberland Street, originally named Fisk Park, but eventually renamed \\"Killeffer Park\\" after Killeffer's son, Louis, a long-time resident of Cornstalk Heights. The site along Clinton Street now occupied by the First Presbyterian Church was originally the site of a school, which operated from 1891 to 1917. Designs Dutch Colonial Revival-style house built in 1924 The earliest (1890-1895) houses in Cornstalk Heights were mostly Victorian homes designed in Queen Anne, Eastlake, and Folk Victorian styles. Colonial Revival and Bungalow/Craftsman styles were more common for houses built after 1900. Other architectural styles represented in the district include Dutch Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Neoclassical Revival, American Foursquare, and Minimal Traditional. Houses in the district range from one to three stories, and typically follow irregular floor plans. Most have gabled roofs, aluminum, brick, or stone siding, and limestone or brick foundations. The district has 33 contributing outbuildings, mainly carriagehouses, servants' quarters, and garages. To compensate for abrupt changes in elevation, limestone retaining walls surround the perimeters of several housing lots, as well as Killeffer Park. The district's sidewalks still consist of the original bricks laid out in the 1890s, some of which bear the stamp of the Robbins Brick Company of Scott County, Tennessee.

It was developed for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The game is based on Rupert Bear, the British cartoon and comics strip character created in 1920 by the British artist Mary Tourtel. In this platform arcade game the player takes the role of Rupert the Bear and the mission is to get to a party in the Toymaker's castle, to meet his friends. According to the story line of this adventure, Rupert has made himself late for the party and must go through the castle collecting all the party invitations his friends have left behind for him. Gameplay The game is divided into seven levels, each being four screens long and consisting of three floors connected by stairways that Rupert uses to go up and down. In each level there are toys and birds who are annoyed because they have not been invited to the party and now are trying to stop Rupert from going too. Each level features different kind and number of enemies like marching toy soldiers, toy trains, Jack-out-of-the-boxes and evil birds. The level of difficulty increases with each level. If Rupert touches any of the toys he loses one of his available energy lives. There are also some allies that will help Rupert on his way to the party. For instance, Rupert can jump on the white-birds and planes and they will transport him to inaccessible platforms of the castle. Once Rupert has collected all the party invitations in a certain level, a door to the next level will open. He must complete all seven levels before making it to the party. If all the lives or chances are lost, Rupert simply gives up and leaves the castle. Reception Magazine reviews of the time praised the game for its graphics and sound effects, including the size of the sprites, the details and colors of the background, capturing the flavour of the original book illustrations, and the music and sound effects.

However, she resumed her research duties at New York in 1884 and served there until she was placed out of commission in 1885 and berthed at New York. The records are unclear, but Alarm probably remained out of commission from that time forward. In 1890 and 1891, she was undergoing conversion to a gunnery training ship. From 1892 to 1894, she remained at the New York Navy Yard. In 1895, she was listed as \\"in ordinary;\\" and, in 1897, her name was struck from the Navy list. She was sold on 23 February 1898.

The site has been pinpointed as the location of a fort and palace of Omurtag, ruler (kanasybigi) of the First Bulgarian Empire in 815‚Äì831, as mentioned in the Chatalar Inscription of 822. Earlier structures in the vicinity of the fortress have been identified as the Arian episcopal see of a Gothic bishop. Gothic episcopal see Ruins of the Arian Gothic basilica The earliest ruins at the Palace of Omurtag site include four churches, two of which built on top of each other; a bath; and fortified walls, all dating to Late Antiquity (roughly 250‚Äì650 CE). Three of the churches and the bath lie outside the medieval fortification, while one of the churches and the traces of ancient walls have been excavated within its limits. Archaeologists and scholars link the ancient ruins to the settlement of Arian Gothic foederati in the area, and specifically to the 4th-century Gothic bishop Ulfilas (Wulfila). He was known to have moved to modern northern Bulgaria with his followers, and he translated the Bible into the Gothic language in Nicopolis ad Istrum. It is thought that the four Gothic churches were destroyed during successive Hunnic raids. A small church unearthed in 1976 has been identified by excavation consultant Todor Balabanov as being a personal church of a high-ranking Goth, possibly Ulfilas. The scarcely preserved layer of Christian frescoes in the church is thought to be the oldest in Bulgaria. Next to this church was built a larger basilica regarded as an Arian episcopal see.Curta, p. 195. The basilica, a nearly square building measuring , features three naves and a two-winged apse. On top of the basilica's ruins lay an octagonal building, with an apse in the northern part. Balabanov claims this is a mausoleum and likens it to the Mausoleum of Theodoric in Ravenna. In the 2000s, researchers unearthed several Gothic graves. Artifacts included medical kits, a chain mail, and characteristic Germanic jewellery, including belt buckles and fibulae (brooches) decorated with gold, gemstones and zoomorphic motifs. In one of the graves, researchers found the remains of a woman with the artificial cranial deformation typical for noble persons among the Goths, Sarmatians and Bulgars. Bulgarian fort and palace=History and excavation Excavated Bulgarian fortifications The Chatalar Inscription, a Bulgarian epigraph written on a column in medieval Greek, was unearthed in 1905 in the village of Han Krum (then known as Chatalar). The inscription's text indicates that kanasybigi Omurtag built an aulƒì with four columns topped by two lion sculptures near the Ticha River.Henning, p. 433. Earlier scholars linked that passage with Preslav, the city that would succeed Omurtag's capital Pliska as the ruling centre of the Bulgarian Empire in the end of the 9th century. In modern times, however, Omurtag's aulƒì has been conclusively proven to be the site at Han Krum, which is much closer to where the epigraph was excavated.Curta, pp. 193‚Äì194. While it remains unclear whether the word aulƒì should be interpreted as the Greek Œ±œçŒªŒÆ (\\"palace, court\\") or the steppe nomadic aul, a fortified ruling centre, the ruins at Han Krum suitably match the medieval description.Henning, p. 433. Archaeological research has established that the medieval site at Han Krum was inhabited for more than 150 years, from 822 until the late 10th century, when the fort was razed. This was not the permanent end of its habitation, as new buildings were constructed on top of the ruins. Excavations of the Palace of Omurtag began in 1957, though they were never fully completed. Since 2000, the site has been extensively excavated by Bulgarian and German archaeologists.Henning, p. 435. Architecture Plan of the Palace of Omurtag The main feature of the archaeological site is the early-9th-century Bulgarian fortified rampart with Omurtag's palace within its limits. While much smaller than the fortifications of nearby Pliska, the fort at Han Krum resembles closely the defensive walls of the capital. The fortress, known to the locals as Hisar Kale (from Turkish, both words meaning \\"castle, fortress\\"), measures and has an area of . Several structures of the same age lay inside the fort; these included an inner fortification in size and stone buildings of varying complexity, such as a three-roomed bath. The inner fort had its main entrance located in the eastern part. The buildings within the enclosure are thought to have served as a noble dwelling, i.e. a palace, though it is archaeologically uncertain whether they date to Omurtag's reign or to a later period. Balabanov theorizes that the fort accommodated a garrison commander and barracks. Fragments of a lion sculpture that was originally in height have been discovered inside the fort, prompting researchers to identify it with one of the two lions mentioned in the Chatalar Inscription.Curta, pp. 195‚Äì196. There are indications that a pagan sanctuary, where animal sacrifice was practiced, was also located at the site. Buried carcasses of rabbits and dogs, medieval vessels, and a plastered stone with rims and furrows allowing blood to flow to a pit all testify to that use. A fifth church at Han Krum, discovered by archaeologist Kremena Stoeva in 2009, is thought to date to the 10th century, the time after the Christianization of Bulgaria. It has three naves and three apses. It has been conclusively dated to that period based on the surrounding pottery, as well as its architecture.

Hastings Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1995. Before the demand for tailored suits waned, the conglomerate operated approximately 200 stores. Wallach's also sold women's apparel. Locations and growth In 1938 Wallachs' Manhattan and Bronx stores were located at Fifth Avenue at Forty- Fifth Street; 253 Broadway near New York City Hall; 53 Broadway near Wall Street; and Fordham Road near the corner of Marion Avenue. Additionally Wallach's had two stores in Brooklyn. One store was located on Court Street and the other in Kings Plaza on Flatbush Avenue. A store measuring was leased by Wallachs and became the largest of its stores in October 1954. It was in a nineteen-story office building at 555 Fifth Avenue. In 1966 Wallachs was a fifteen unit chain of stores. Price fixing lawsuit In February 1956 a $3,000,000 antitrust lawsuit was filed against Wallachs and R.H. Macy & Company by Alexander's. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants were engaging in unlawful restraints and monopolies in trade. Alexander's contended that from 1935 to 1955 it purchased more than $1,000,000 in merchandise from clothing manufacturers David D. Doniger & Company and Laurelton Sportswear. For several years prior to 1955 both Wallachs and R.H. Macy & Company bought merchandise from the same manufacturers. Alexander's maintained that the prices for which it retailed the clothing was about 17% less than those offered by the competitors it was instigating legal action against. The complaint stated that since 1953 the defendants had conspired to eliminate Alexander's as a competitor by price fixing of products. Consumer friendly In the mid 1970s, Wallachs held classes to instruct on how to tie a scarf. At one time Wallachs' customers and passersby were asked to come inside to have loose buttons sewn on or missing buttons replaced at no cost. Shoe laces, collar stays, hat bags, and feathers for hats were provided to shoppers who requested them. Additional free extras given out at retail counters included clothes brushes and identification tags which buttoned inside raincoats.

The band consists of vocalist Jack Delany; guitarists Tim George, Tom Hollings and Matthew Pugh; and drummer Sam Brennan. There have been numerous line-up changes within the band, mainly due to members wishing to pursue education. According to the band, its name derives from a conversation the band members had whilst watching the Star Wars saga. They have released two extended plays, and two full-length studio albums. Their debut EP By Sunset was released in November 2007 after writing and recording it earlier that year. In 2007, they signed with Listenable Records and then released their debut album, A Clear Perception, on the record label in 2009. Their second studio album, Breathless, was released in July 2010 after featuring a different line-up, maintaining only the vocalist and drummer of the band as original members. In 2011, they independently released and distributed a second EP, The Disease EP, through live shows.

A year after their formation, they parted ways with their bassist, Ian Cubbon, due to musical differences. Releasing their first extended play, By Sunset on the underground English label Thirty Days of Night Records led to them touring across the country. Their first tour was a seven- day UK tour in support of the Italian blackened-death-metal band Godless Crusade. In the winter of 2007, the band did a headline tour with the death- metal band Aortic Dissection, leading to them being acknowledged by Listenable Records. This subsequently led to the signing of a three-album deal with the label. Guitarist David McCretton left the band at this time to further his education and was replaced by Pugh, an old friend of the band. In conjunction with their release of the A Clear Perception album produced by Ed Sokolowski at EAS Studios in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire Video (uploaded 3 June 2008). \\"The Eyes of a Traitor Studio Video 2nd June Guitars\\".

Shortly after, the band embarked on a seven-day headline tour with the English melodic death metal band Ignominious Incarceration, as well as the bands Argent Dawn and Many Things Untold. This was the start of an extensive tour schedule which was to occupy them for the remainder of the year. On 1 September 2009, the band released a digital single, \\"Nothing to Offer\\". This was later re-recorded for their second album, Breathless. On 18 January 2010, Paul Waudby announced that he would be leaving the band in pursuit of a career outside of the music industry. With the band due to go into the studio two weeks later, Jack Moulsdale both a close friend and technical support of the band stood in to become their new bassist. In anticipation of the release of Breathless in July 2010, the band toured across the UK and Continental Europe extensively, joining the American mathcore band The Chariot's European headline tour with the American metal band Iwrestledabearonce starting 9 April and extending until 9 May 2010. On 27 June 2010, they appeared at Ghostfest 2010 on the Monster Energy Stage alongside other groups, including Gallows, Devil Sold His Soul and Lower Than Atlantis. On 18 September 2010, the band revealed on their Facebook module that they would release an EP consisting of four re-recorded tracks from their debut album: \\"Under Siege\\", \\"Escape These Walls\\", \\"Like Clockwork\\" and \\"The Impact of Two Hearts\\". The EP was originally announced to be released around Christmas, but was delayed indefinitely. Justin Lowe, the guitarist of the American metalcore band After the Burial, mixed the tracks while Sokolowski produced them. The EP's completion was hindered because After the Burial was touring with the American band As I Lay Dying. The Disease and proposed third studio album (since 2011) Between 16 September and 23 September 2011, the band toured the UK with the British melodic hardcore band Heart in Hand and deathcore band Martyr Defiled. As part of the tour they had a promotion of their new four-track EP, The Disease EP, limited to 200 copies and sold only at concerts. In conjunction, the title track \\"Disease\\" became available to stream from the band's Facebook module. On 9 November 2011, the EP was made free by the band via Front magazine. On 20 November 2011, the band revealed, via their Facebook module, that they were taking a break as a band. Brennan joined Heart in Hand, while Delany started two new metalcore bands, Rivers and Brave the Moment. Upon Delany joining Brave The Moment he helped write his first song with the band False Prophet and made his first live performance with the band at Stay Rad Festival 2012 with Heart of a Coward and Polar.Delany then joined Manchester metalcore band Empires Fade The band did only two one-off shows in 2012, initially in Madrid, Spain, with the German metalcore band Caliban, on 4 May 2012, but then they were confirmed to play at Ghostfest 2012 on Sunday 1 July. The band replaced Rivers, one of the bands that developed out of The Eyes of a Traitor that had to pull out of the festival. Hollings and Alex Green, formerly of English mathcore-technical- metal band The Arusha Accord, performed with the band at Ghostfest, with Hollings becoming the band's new bassist and Green performing clean vocals. Since announcing their hiatus, they have been writing their third album. Musical style and influences Whitworth, when asked how he would describe the band's sound, said that they \\"combine technicality with melodic sensibilities, metal and occasional sprinklings from other genres.\\" The band have been described by critics as metalcore, melodic death metal, melodic metalcore, experimental thrash and progressive metal. They have been described by critics as \\"math metal\\", which shows their music's close proximity to mathcore but retaining more metallic elements rather than hardcore. Many critics have credited them for their accelerated progression through the British metal scene considering the age of the band members. By the time their first EP was released, the average age of the members was 17. Members of the band have said they are influenced by the metalcore band Textures as well as a heavy amount of technical death metal bands, including Gojira and Necrophagist. Other influences include Children of Bodom, In Flames, Misery Signals, Mesuggah, Slipknot and Thrice.

It is situated 20 km south-east of the capital, in the heart of the Natural Park of Maremma. This area includes the surrounding rural territories which begin with the first foot-hills of the hinterland and end with the sea, crossing the northern peaks of the Uccellina Mountains. History Even during prehistory some ancient caves were inhabited, such as the one of the Scoglietto, which conserves traces of even more recent life (Bronze Age, Roman period), Etruscan (Poggio Raso) and Roman (Santa Francesca, Le Frasche) remains are present mainly towards Talamone and along Via Aurelia. The modern rural residence area, dominated by the imposing mass of the Villa Granducale, was developed in the last two centuries, thanks to the freehold Reform and to the allocation of the territories to farmers, most coming from Veneto and Northern Italy. Environment In spite of the presence of man, the natural surrounding havens, with their heritage of game reserves and large flower expanses, have been saved. At present, the body of the Natural Park of Maremma and a series of regional laws allow to safeguard conservation and the lasting of these beauties. Herds of wild horses and Maremmana cows still scamper among the wide fields while deer and wild boars live undisturbed within the dense forests of the Uccellina Mountains. Within the Park there is not only uncontaminated nature but numerous and sometimes evident are the signs of man's presence in various periods. In every season the exterminated country-side becomes alive again with the colours of nature; ochre in autumn and in winter, green in spring and yellow in summer. This is the time when expanses of sunflowers are alternated to fields of wheat. In the sunny summer days it is not uncommon to run into the phenomenon of the Fata Morgana crossing bare-foot the long and straight nearby roads. Climate The climate of the locality and of the Alberese area presents characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, more marked along the coastal area and lightly attenuated in the plain area in which the centre stands. This is due to the presence, from west, of the Uccellina Mountains which create a limited barrier effect from the mitigation action of the sea. The medium temperatures in January are testified at around +7 ¬∞C, while in July temperatures exceed 22 ¬∞C. On average the values are a bit inferior, mainly in the summer season, to those registered at the two weather stations in Grosseto. In comparison to the capital, average annual precipitations result to be inferior, both in quantity (600 mm per year) and in frequency (62 days per year with at least 1 mm). Rain results to be very scarce during the three-month summer season (on average about 60 mm in just 7 days).

In 2005, Brevard is first in Florida in the number of \\"A\\"-rated schools in the 10 largest districts. AARP ranked the school district No. 8 on the 2005 list of Best Employers for Workers Over 50. It was the only public-school system and the highest-ranked Florida employer on the national list. In 2005, Brevard led the state in science in fifth and 11th grade assessments. In 2006, Brevard students took almost a third of all prizes at the state science fair, including the most first-place awards. This occurred in 2007, as well.

Origins and education  Crato von Krafftheim was born Johannes Krafft. He was the son of the artisan and council leader Christoph Krafft and a student at the Breslau/Wroclaw Gymnasium of St. Elisabeth and Mary Magdalene. On account of his prodigious academic talent, the city council of Breslau bestowed a 20 Gulden fellowship upon Crato, with further benefactions of the Breslau patrician families, to continue his studies at the university level.Gerhard Eis, in NDB 3:402.J. F. A. Gillet (1860) Crato von Crafftheim und seine Freunde pp. 52-66.  Studies and residency in Wittenberg  Crato's house, 17 Judenstrasse in Wittenberg Luther's house and college rooms in Wittenberg From 1535 onwards, Crato studied theology and lived six years in the household of Martin Luther in the University of Wittenberg. He also lived for some time at 17 Burgermeisterstrasse.Plaque to Crato at 17 Burgermeisterstrasse in Wittenberg He also became acquainted with Philipp Melanchthon there and under his influence engaged in an in depth study of classical languages. Crato took his M.A. in 1542., Kindle edition location 1424-31, \\"Rheticus's other graduation speech, in April 1542, accompanied the awarding of only ten new M.A. degrees, compared with twenty-two in February. However the recipients included the illustrious Johannes Crato, who would prove himself a loyal friend to Rheticus and who went on to become the personal physician to three successive emperors.\\" He kept a diary during his time in Wittenberg which was used as a source for Johannes Aurifaber's influential edition of Luther's Table Talk (Colloquia oder Tischreden Doctor Martini Lutheri). On Luther's suggestion, who did not think Crato well suited for a theological career, Crato decided to study medicine. He served briefly in this time as the tutor to the Counts of Wertheim in Leipzig. Also in this era, he developed a close relationship with Joachim Camerarius the Younger.  Medical studies and residency in Italy  With the support of the Breslau city council and the recommendation of Philipp Melanchthon and Joachim Camerarius the elder, Crato studied medicine at the University of Padua from 1546. He was a student of the famous medical professor Johannes Baptista Montanus, who exercised a decisive influence on Crato's first works. Crato completed his medical studies by taking his doctorate and undertook a tour of Italy with his friends Johann Baptist Hainzel und Paul Hainzel. He briefly practiced medicine in Verona.  Medical practice and later life In 1550 Crato returned to his hometown Breslau where he was named the second town physician. That year he married the daughter of the city secretary Johannes Scharf von Werd and began his family. The marriage produced one son and two daughters. Crato proved his value to the city during his service in the Plague epidemic of 1554, as he had previously composed a \\"Pestordnung\\" in 1553. The city compensated him with a yearly salary of 100 Thalers as a reward for his sacrificial service. He was charged with the treatment of public servants and poor students. Although his fame as a physician was spreading almost across Germany, the reigning city council leader Hans Morenberger removed him from his post as physician to the poor because Crato was suspected of being a Calvinist. His prior conversion from Catholicism to the Protestant faith had increased suspicions in Crato's beliefs. In 1560 Crato was called to the imperial court in Vienna to become personal physician to Emperor Ferdinand I. As the emperor's health declined, Crato resettled to Vienna; however, he and his family returned to Breslau after Emperor Ferdinand died in 1564. In the next year, however, he was named principal personal physician of Emperor Maximilian II, whom he served for 11 years. In 1567 Maximilian II, who paid Crato exorbitantly and lavished honors upon him, ennobled Crato and a year later raised him to the rank of \\"Count Palatine.\\" In his position as an imperial count palatine, Crato bestowed patents of nobility on: *Johann Woyssel, Vienna, 1 May 1569 *Martin Weinrich, 1583; Professor at the Elisabeth-Gymnasium in Breslau *Lorenz Scholz von Rosenau, 1585 The emperor placed great trust in him, which Crato in turn used on behalf of the Calvinists and the Bohemian Brethren/Unitas Fratrum. On this account the court Jesuits were not able to secure Maximilian's support for the active suppression of Protestantism. As a representative of an irenic Melanchthonian-Calvinist orientation, Crato struggled against the Gnesio- Lutheran followers of Matthias Flacius Illyricus As a prominent representative of Humanist \\"school\\" medicine, Crato suffered a severe professional embarrassment when an unlearned female practitioner was called in to serve at the death bed of the emperor. After Maximilian's death, Crato was released - like all the Protestants - from imperial service, and he returned to Breslau. However, already in 1577 Crato was called to the court again to serve as physician to the sickly Emperor Rudolph II. Although he was himself ill, he moved to Prague again in 1578 to be near the emperor. He soon suffered under the growing influence of the Jesuits, and he endeavored to secure his release from court. He secured his release in the fall of 1581, and he retired to his estate R√ºckers in the County of Glatz, then an integral dominion of the Bohemian crown, which he had acquired in 1567. He founded a Reformed Protestant community there with a church and a pastor. He intended to spend the remainder of his life there and had his library shipped in from Prague. Crato befriended some of the leading intellectuals of his time including Camerarius, Volcher Coiter, Henri Estienne, Thomas Erastus, Konrad Gessner, Paulo Aldo Manutio II., Johannes Sambucus, Piero Vettori, and Theodor Zwinger, Georg Joachim Rheticus among others. His Silesian prot√©g√©s included Zacharias Ursinus, Jakob Monau, Peter Monau, and Lorenz Scholz von Rosenau.J. F. A. Gillet (1860) Crato von Crafftheim und seine Freunde, passim. Desiring the stimulation of the scholarly life, he returned to Breslau in 1583 and handed his manor over to his son. Despite his age and illness, he worked again in Breslau as a plague physician for the common townsfolk. His wife died of the pestilence. He followed her on 19 October 1585. His son Johann Baptist von Krafftheim inherited his R√ºckers manor. He was married to Anna von Heugel, who received the estate upon Johann Baptist's death.  The first known written autopsy  Crato and court surgeon Peter Suma, performed the first autopsy documented in writing on October 13, 1576 in Regensburg on the deceased Emperor Maximilian II. The autopsy report was signed by the Regensburg physician Fabricius and authenticated by the notary Linda. The internal organs of the emperor were placed in a gold-plated copper pot that was buried on the left side of the high altar in the Regensburg Cathedral. Today there is a memorial stone inscribed with the imperial crown of Maximilian and the monogram of the year 1576 at this spot. The heart of the emperor was placed in a precious box put back in his body inside the coffin. Whether this was an autopsy in a scientific and anatomical sense is questionable. The practice was used mainly for preparing the body for the religious purposes in order to leave a part of the body remaining in the place in which one possessed a special relationship.Leopold Senfelder, (1898) ‚ÄúKaiser Maximilian‚Äôs II. letzte Lebensjahre und Tod,‚Äù Bl√§tter des Vereines f√ºr Landeskunde von Nieder√∂sterreich, Neue Folge 22: 47-75  Works  * Idea doctrinae Hippocraticae. 1554 * Methodus therapeutica ex Galeni et J.

Directed by Bernard Rose, Mr Nice is in part a biopic, a loose film adaptation of Mr Nice, the 1997 cult autobiography by Howard Marks. The film features an ensemble cast starring Rhys Ifans as Howard Marks, along with David Thewlis, Omid Djalili, Jack Huston, Crispin Glover and Chlo√´ Sevigny. Ifans portrays Marks, a Welsh marijuana smuggler who ran one of the biggest global cannabis smuggling operations from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, mostly while on the run. Marks associated with some of the more colourful characters of the era, allegedly even cutting deals with the FBI, the Mafia, the IRA and MI6. After serving time in Terre Haute, one of the \\"toughest\\" prisons in the United States, Marks stopped smuggling and dealing in cannabis (although he still openly used the drug himself) and gained wider fame as a pro-cannabis campaigner, stand-up comedian, actor (at least in cameos), lads' mag columnist, television show panelist, music producer, motivational speaker, and even prospective Member of Parliament. Like Marks's autobiography on which it is based, the film has polarised critics. Plot The film begins in 2010, with 65-year-old Howard Marks going onto a stage in front of a packed theatre to great applause. Marks asks if there are any plainclothes policemen in the audience, to which the reply is negative. Then, while lighting up a joint, Marks asks, \\"Who here is a dope (marijuana) smoker?\\", to even greater applause. The film then diverts to Marks's internal monologue as he recounts his life. Born in the Welsh valleys in 1945, young Howard Marks (Rhys Ifans), later nicknamed Mr Nice, excels academically beyond the national standard of the United Kingdom. This remarkable aptitude earns him a scholarship to Oxford University at age nineteen, where he reads philosophy and physics. But Marks's destiny changes one night while he is dutifully studying alone in his dorm. A beautiful, rebellious and hedonistic foreign exchange student from Latvia, Ilze Kadegis (Elsa Pataky), breaks into Marks's room, looking for a secret passageway within. Marks follows Kadegis through the secret passageway and into a forgotten storage space used by one of the school's top marijuana dealers, Graham Plinson (Jack Huston). Kadegis seduces Marks and introduces him to cannabis for the first time. For the next few years, Marks becomes an enthusiastic customer of Plinson's, and continues his love affairs with both Kadegis and cannabis. The group enjoy a series of wilder and wilder nights, with their academic lives suffering as a result. Circumstances change for the worse when Plinson introduces the group to LSD. When rich heir Joshua Macmillan, a friend of Marks's, dies of an overdose and Marks impales his foot on a spike, Marks vows to never touch drugs again - or at least the harder variety of drugs. The trio of Marks, Kadegis and Plinson promise each other to turn over a new leaf, and they pass their scholarships through some intense last-minute revision and a little cheating. They then all move on to teacher training courses at the University of London in 1967, where Marks hastily marries Kadegis. Fractures begin appearing early in their marriage, with Marks becoming despondent, apathetic and suspecting Kadegis of having an affair. Marks also gets into trouble at the university for \\"having long hair and flashy suits\\". When plans to bring a large cache of hashish into England via Germany go wrong and Plinson is arrested, Marks steps in to help, figuring that he has nothing left to lose anyway. Marks goes to Germany and drives a car holding the stash of drugs across the borders himself, simply driving through customs. The customs officers are on the lookout for Plinson's crew, but do not know Marks, who sails through without incident. Marks says that the thrill of getting away with it was like a \\"religious flash and an asexual orgasm\\". After Marks sells the hashish back in London to an Arab oil sheik named Saleem Malik (Omid Djalili), he makes a fortune and swiftly becomes addicted to this new but dangerous lifestyle as a big league marijuana trafficker, eventually running a large percentage of the world's cannabis trade. It is a path that will lead Marks face-to-face with terrorists, government agents, and lose him his freedom to one of the toughest prisons in the United States in 1988, through to the present day as a media personality and cult hero.

In development hell for over a decade, the production of the film was an eventual collaboration between a number of smaller studios, including Independent Productions, Kanzaman Productions S.L., S√©ville Pictures, Prescience, Lipsync Productions LLP and the Wales Creative IP Fund. Marks himself was the main consultant for the film and for Ifans. The DVD includes a commentary by Howard Marks as well as a featurette with Rhys Ifans joining Marks on one of his stand-up shows and impersonating him to the delight of the crowd, with both getting intoxicated to the point of incoherence. Mr Nice was filmed in 2009 in Benidorm, Spain. The film features a 1960s pop-inspired soundtrack by Philip Glass, with original songs reflective of the era such as the works of Deep Purple, Fraternity of Man and John Lennon.

Critical reception Mr Nice polarized critics. , the film holds a 53% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 45 reviews with an average rating of 5.53 out of 10. Dan Jolin of the film magazine Empire gave Mr Nice three out of five stars, writing \\"A solid, often entertaining life-of-crimer which benefits from some stylistic touches and a faithful, convincing central performance.\\" Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling the Philip Glass soundtrack \\"pulsating\\" and writing: \\"Though the film takes a while to cast its spell, writer-director-cinematographer Bernard Rose's close observation of Marks and those around him becomes increasingly involving and allows Rose to comment on the widespread failure of the War on Drugs.\\" Time Out London gave the film four out of five stars, although it noted that the film was not without flaws: \\"The film adaptation of Howard Marks' autobiography ‚Äì a student staple throughout the land ‚Äì struggles to capture the sheer breadth of Marks' life.\\" Benjamin Mercer of The Village Voice also gave a polarized review, awarding the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, yet also claiming that the film gave him the impression of glorifying cannabis use, or at the very least, being a vehicle for the advocation of legalizing cannabis - \\"Though told here with appealing drollness, Marks' story makes an odd vessel for the filmmakers' casually advanced legalization arguments, what with its mischief making on the grandest scale possible.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2010 films Category:2010 biographical drama films Category:2010 crime drama films Category:Biographical films about drug traffickers Category:British biographical drama films Category:British crime drama films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Bernard Rose (director) Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Oxford Category:Films set in prison Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in the 1960s Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Spanish biographical drama films Category:Spanish crime drama films Category:Spanish films Category:Stoner crime films Category:Films with screenplays by Bernard Rose (director) Category:2010 drama films ","title":"Mr Nice"},{"id":"26518863","text":"The Rockerz were an American rock band originally from Atlanta, Georgia, United States, that experienced popularity in the Southeastern United States during the 1990s-2000s.

It is a satire about a jaded Nobel- winning physicist whose dysfunctional personal life and cynical ambition see him pursuing a solar-energy based solution for climate change. Plot summary Michael Beard is an eminent, Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist whose own life is chaotic and complicated. The novel takes the reader chronologically through three significant periods in Beard's life: 2000, 2005 and 2009, interspersed with some recollections of his student days in Oxford. 2000 Middle-aged, balding and slightly overweight womanizer Beard falls into a depression after learning that his fifth wife, Patrice, has begun an affair with their builder, a man called Tarpin. Despite being a Nobel award-winning physicist Beard realizes all his best work was done as a young man and now coasts on his reputation heading a research centre in Reading that seeks to harness wind energy. One of the younger researchers at the centre, Tom Aldous, tries to speak to Beard about the potential of solar energy but Beard shuts him down. After seeing Patrice with a bruise on her face Beard goes to confront Tarpin, but finds himself no match for the man and leaves after causing a scene in front of Tarpin's neighbours. Depressed over his marriage Beard accepts an invitation to go to the Arctic as part of a retreat on climate change. While there he realizes he is the only scientist among groups of artists who believe passionately in climate change (which he remains skeptical of) though they treat him with respect, believing his research in wind-based energy constitutes concrete steps towards combatting global warming. Beard returns home from his trip deciding to divorce Patrice. Arriving early however he encounters Tom Aldous in his bathrobe. After Beard tells him he will ruin his career Aldous begs him not to imploring him that his research into photosynthesis and solar energy is more important than the feud between the two of them. While pleading for his career Aldous trips on a rug and strikes his head against a coffee table. Beard realizes that if he calls the police he could be blamed for Aldous's death and instead plants evidence of Tarpin's presence. Tarpin is indeed arrested and convicted of Aldous's murder and Beard is painted in the media as a sympathetic figure who had been cuckolded by his wife. Aldous's research on solar energy is given to Beard as it had been labelled with his name. 2005 By 2005 Beard is experiencing a career resurgence due to his research into solar energy which in actuality was the research of Tom Aldous. Beard no longer works for the government having been fired after giving a press conference in which he stated that the lack of women in science was due to the natural limitations of their gender. The ensuing anger into his comments caused a media storm and resulted in his womanizing past being scrutinized in the press. He has a sexual relationship with a younger woman named Melissa who owns a string of dance supply shops whom he deliberately refuses to marry despite her desire for a child. Returning home from a trip Melissa informs Beard that she is currently pregnant having stopped taking birth control pills. Beard is angry and tries to think of ways to convince Melissa to have an abortion. 2009 Beard is now a father, and sixty-two years old. He is not in the best of health, and is worried about a suspicious-looking lesion on his wrist. His solar power plant is in the final stages of construction in Lordsburg, New Mexico, where he has acquired another girlfriend, Darlene, a waitress. Darlene wants to marry him, but he has a very comfortable set-up with Melissa and his three-year-old daughter, Catriona. All his problems culminate on the eve of the opening ceremony for his solar power plant. Tarpin is out of jail and turns up looking for work, Melissa flies to New Mexico with his daughter to try and win him over from Darlene, a patent lawyer arrives with proof that he stole his ideas from the now-dead Aldous, his doctor confirms the lesion on his hand is cancerous, his business partner abandons him to multimillion- dollar debts, and then he learns that somebody (presumably Tarpin) has sabotaged his power plant by smashing the solar panels. In the final scene Beard gets an \\"unfamiliar, swelling sensation\\" in his heart which he interprets as love for his daughter, but may well be the onset of a heart attack. Background The novel is primarily a work of fiction but draws heavily on references to real science and modern history. Michael Beard's trip to the Norwegian Arctic island of Spitsbergen is based on a 2005 trip McEwan made with art and climate change organisation, Cape Farewell. The group of artists and scientists that McEwan travelled with included Antony Gormley and Rachel Whiteread.http://www.capefarewell.com/expeditions/2005.html Accessed 20 April 2011 He later said of the trip: Reception In 2010, Solar was awarded the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize, a British literary award for comic writing.https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/apr/13/leith-knight- wodehouse-book-prize External links *Review by RealClimate *Review by Publishers Weekly *Audiobook review by Publishers Weekly * Review by The Independent *Review by The Guardian *Review by The Telegraph *Review by Time (magazine) * Ian McEwan presents \\"Solar\\" in Barcelona, Canal-L References Category:2010 British novels Category:Novels by Ian McEwan Category:Novels set in the Arctic Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:Novels set in Berkshire Category:Fiction set in 2000 Category:Fiction set in 2005 Category:Fiction set in 2009 Category:Novels set in New Mexico ","title":"Solar (novel)"},{"id":"26518873","text":"The Albatros C.II was a 1910s German military pusher reconnaissance biplane designed and built by Albatros Flugzeugwerke.

Synopsis The film follows five British schoolteachers from Birmingham, England in their journey to Pakistan as part of a British Council Pakistan project, commonly known as Connecting Classrooms. The plethora of inter-cultural dialogue that ensues as the two cultures disclose both tradition and practice under the umbrella of education, transforms a simple visit to Bhit Shah, Sindh into a mutually beneficent exchange. The Film Rebecca Bailey is a schoolteacher at the Hill West Primary School. Kamal Hanif and Ian Healey are the Head and Assistant Head teachers respectively at the Waverley School, West Midlands. Heather Hepworth and Sheila Holden are Assistant Head and Deputy Head teachers respectively at the Calthorpe Special School. The film records the experiences and the change in perception of these five schoolteachers that have come to Pakistan as part of Connecting Classrooms ‚Äì a British Council Pakistan project that facilitates inter-cultural dialogue, and especially, an understanding of the different teaching styles employed in the UK and that of other countries. Not knowing what to expect, the British schoolteachers are at first most excited about learning from and working with each other, as under no other circumstances would the three schools be able to come together and exchange ideas. Finding the same hustle bustle at 4 in the morning at the Jinnah International Airport as the plane lands in Karachi that they would at 8 pm in Birmingham kick- starts the series of experiences and discoveries that this documentary explores. The traditions and customs of Sindh serve as the contextual framework to what they learn about education in Pakistan, how they interact with its peoples, and the many ways in which they embrace its culture. Following an introductory meeting with the Office of District Government Matiari, the British schoolteachers visit several public schools in the vicinity, including one for children with mental disabilities. They discover that teaching styles are more direct in Pakistan, with an ‚ÄòI talk, you listen‚Äô approach as opposed to ‚Äòlet us do it together‚Äô that is used in the UK. One look at the children‚Äôs report cards, however, ascertains the effectiveness of this approach in the results that appear to be just as good. An emphasis on discipline surfaces as a common feature in all the individual opinions expressed, when inquired about the school visits. The documentary segregates the experiences of these teachers into two major categories. The first category can be characterized as the material artifacts such as ceramic wares, Ajrak ‚Äì a special kind of blockprinted shawl that serves as a symbol, woodwork, and bangles that represent Sindh‚Äôs outer surface. This also includes rides on a Bullock cart, an Auto rikshaw, and the public bus which is world- famous for ornamental art on the outside as well as the inside. Rebecca Bailey volunteers to try everything from making and painting intricate pottery to taking a ride on a public bus that is crowded enough to burst at the seams. The second category can be characterized as general culture and the value system that exhibits the land‚Äôs deep-rooted core. Generosity - especially the manner in which gifts are exchanged, a sense of community found almost everywhere, the significance of keeping tradition alive, being one with nature, a fusion of both Hindu and Muslim religions ‚Äì illustrated in the shrine at Dera Lal, marketplaces that never sleep are just some of the aspects highlighted upon by the British schoolteachers. There is greater substance in this film than just a cultural exchange. When Brummies Met Sindhis taps into the human being‚Äôs ability to connect with another human being, irrespective of race, creed, religion, profession, or location even. Background=The British Council Pakistan The British Council Pakistan's primary objective is to facilitate educational and cultural relations between the UK and Pakistan. Established in 1948, the Council has services available in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Faisalabad, Multan, and Quetta. Its efforts have borne fruit at the individual level, in the form of building relationships between both people and institutions, as well as at state level by improving the relationship between the two countries. Learning, professional networking, and youth-based special activities are just some of the ways in which this is achieved. Connecting Classrooms Connecting Classrooms is one such endeavour. Under this global program, partner schools in the UK and Pakistan collaborate on curriculum tasks. Their school leaders and teachers are given professional development. These schools are also eligible to undertake measures that will provide them with an International School Award accreditation. Teachers can participate in global networking with other teachers through online communities. Sindh A traditional home to the Sindhis in Pakistan, today the province of Sindh it also has large number of Urdu-speaking population. The independence of Pakistan gave way to the Muslim culture into this land, as the Muslim refugees started to settle here. Celebrated for giving rise to the Indus Valley Civilization, Sindh has a rich cultural heritage encompassing varied eras of influence by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander the Great, the Seleucid rule, the Mauryan Empire, the Shunga Dynasty, the Greek rule, the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Scythian tribes, the Tocharian Kushan Empire, the Sassanid Empire of Persia, Kidarites, the Hephthalite tribes, the Rai Dynasty, the Umayyad Caliphate, the Soomra Dynasty, the Samma Dynasty, the Mughal Empire, and finally, the British Raj. All these empires have left their mark somewhere in Sindhi traditions and customs. Reception As a multiple, first-person narrative the film received positive review by renowned Pakistani journalist and writer Bina Shah in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, where Shah called it \\"a fantastic documentary\\".

It was part of the Marian civil war in which the Clan Forbes supported the King James VI and the Clan Gordon supported Mary, Queen of Scots. So called due to its proximity to Craibstone Croft, the battle was won by the Gordons who forced the Forbes into retreat in approximately one hour with the loss of sixty men. According to news of the battle sent to John Lesley, the secretary of Mary, Queen of Scots, the number of casualties was three-score, 60 men, on each side, and the son of Lord Forbes, Alexander Master of Forbes, was imprisoned at Huntly Castle. According to the chronicle Diurnal of Occurrents, the Master of Forbes accompanied by Captains Chisholm and Wedderburn marched from Cowie to Aberdeen on 20 November 1571. Chisholm and Wedderburn, the Regent's men, commanded two bands of musketeers called \\"hagbutters.\\" Their whole strength was about 800 men. Adam Gordon of Auchindoun and Captain Ker had 900 men in the town. The Forbes came over the bridge of Aberdeen, and fought with Adam's men for an hour at Craibstone. The Forbes retreated, Chisholm and 300 men were killed, and the Master of Forbes and 200 men were captured. Two hundred Gordons were killed. Richard Bannatyne mentions that some cavalry commanded by Alexander Campbell fought with the Forbes. Bannatyne says that the Forbes and the Regent's troops came to Aberdeen because they were short of food. Adam Gordon was reluctant to fight because he was outgunned, but saw his chance after the troops \\"foolishly\\" wasted their ammunition. The Forbes bowmen or archers fled, Bannatyne wrote they \\"gave backis, and did no guid.\\" The Historie of King James Sext says there were 600 cavalrymen. The pursuit of the fleeing Forbes covered four miles. The Historie of James Sext (which is biased against the Regents of Scotland), says that the Gordons had only 30 casualties and the Forbes 300, although all the other sources make the number more evenly matched.

Hawkins had never secured a winning season during his tenure at Colorado, finishing with a record of 19-39 and in the midst of a 17-game road losing streak. Bohn promoted Associate Head Coach Brian Cabral to fill in as interim Head Coach for the remainder of the 2010 season, as the University prepared for national search to replace Hawkins.

There are, in fact, two distinct Kagzi communities, with their own customs, traditions and origin myths, one found in Gujarat and the other in Maharashtra The Gujarat Kagzi claim to have come to Ahmedabad have from Bukhara in Central Asia, at the invitation of Sultan Ahmad Shah. The community have always been associated with the manufacture of paper, and many still reside in the Shahpur area of Ahmedabad their original settlement in Gujarat. Numerous Kagzi families also live in Kagziwaad, Rajaji's Pole and Munshi ka dehla localities in Shahpur, part of the old city. They are typically fair skinned and light eyed. In Maharashtra, the Kagzi claim to be descended from soldiers of the Tughlaq armies that invaded the Deccan. They are now found mainly in the districts of Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Pune, Akola and Nasik. The Maharashtra Kagzi speak the Dakhani dialect of Urdu, although most can understand Marathi.  Present circumstances  The Gujarat Kagzi are divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Mehtar, Pathan, Raddiwala, Khanzada, Munshi and Mirza. Their traditional occupation has been greatly affected by the growth of paper mills, and many Kagzis have abandoned their paper manufacturing. Many are now involved in petty trade, or have taken to farming. The Ahmadabad Kagzi Jamaat is their caste association, and deals with the various problems of the community. The Maharashtra Kagzi are divided into a number of territorial groupings, such as the Yawalwale, Badwale and Kalekhwale. Each of these territorial groupings has a caste association, known as a jamaat. Although marriages are permitted within these groupings, they are rare. The Kaghzi have seen a complete decline in their traditional occupation, and most are now either businessmen or involved in other occupations. They are one of the more successful Muslim community in Maharashtra, and have a fairly active caste association, the Kagzi Jamaat, which deals with issues of community welfare.

It is located in a valley at the foot of the Helderberg Escarpment along New York State Route 85. A local fair and car show is held every year in this small hamlet. It is also home to the town of New Scotland's community center and museum. History The area of New Salem was first settled as farmland around 1770 and soon the Beaverdam Road was established through the future hamlet. Legend has it that the original name of the hamlet, Punkintown, was because a sow and her litter were able to live inside a \\"punkin\\" (pumpkin) since the pumpkins grown in the area grew so large. When the post office was established here in 1830 the name New Salem was used. Map of New Salem in 1866 In 1806, the Beaverdam Road was moved to follow the contour of the mountains and from this time the progress of New Salem began with the building of several houses and a church. In 1850 the Albany, Rensselaerville, and Schoharie Plank Road Company was established by the state to construct a plank road from Albany through New Salem, to Gallupville in Schoharie County. The section from New Salem north and east to Albany was graded and planked but the section from New Salem west to Berne was not improved. In 1854, the state authorized the company to abandon or sell portions and to turn other sections into a turnpike and charge tolls, the section from New Salem east to the hamlet of New Scotland subsequently had its planks removed. In 1947, DeWitt Carl moved his service station to New Salem from Albany naming the New Salem Garage, and in 1961 he transformed it into an auto dealership dealing exclusively with Saabs. New Salem Garage Inc., even though no longer in New Salem continues to use the name, and remains the seventh oldest Saab dealership in the United States and the oldest continually family-owned and operated Saab dealership in the Northeastern US. In the early 1990s, the New Salem Garage moved four miles east to a Slingerlands address and the location in New Salem (with the same owners and still named the New Salem Garage, just as the car dealership) became a lawn and garden center specializing in Cub Cadet lawn tractors, mowers, and snowblowers. The New Salem Schoolhouse, a former one-room rural schoolhouse, was used by the New Salem Historical Society and the New Scotland town senior citizens group when in 1988 the town decided to enlarge and renovate the building in order to make it the town's first community center. In 1997, the New Scotland Historical Society opened a museum of the town's history in the community center's Spaulding Room. Geography New Salem is located in the western section of the town of New Scotland, west of the hamlet of that name and southwest of the village of Voorheesville. The hamlet sits in a valley formed by the Helderberg Escarpment to the west and some hills to the east. The core of the hamlet is situated at the intersection of New Scotland Road (New York State Route 85) and the western terminus of New York State Route 85A (New Salem Road). Location=Culture New Salem is home to the Wyman Osterhout Community Center, a former one-room school house. The community center is home to the New Scotland Historical Society (NSHS), the senior citizen center, and the NSHS's town history museum. Since 1942 the town has hosted a Punkintown Fair originally meant to raise money for cigarettes and other goods for soldiers overseas in World War II, since 1946 it has been sponsored by the volunteer fire department to raise money for new equipment. A classic car show is held the weekend prior to the fair. Education New Salem is a part of the Voorheesville Central School District (VCS) and the children attend Voorheesville Elementary School for kindergarten through fifth grade, Voorheesville Middle School for grades six to eight and Clayton A.

She is portrayed by Britt Robertson. The result of a teenage pregnancy, her mother gave her up for adoption. However, she has a heart problem, meaning that she was never adopted and was entered into the foster care system, unknown to Cate who was told that her baby would be adopted. Lux was reunited with her birth parents whilst applying for emancipation. Storylines Lux Cassidy was born in Summer of 1993 as the result of a one-night stand between her parents, Cate Cassidy and Nate Bazile during their winter formal when they were teenagers. After she was born, Cate put her up for adoption on the advice of her mother, with Nate believing Cate had an abortion. Lux was born with a congenital heart defect and spent the first few years of her life in hospital due to various surgeries she needed. She received her name from a nurse during one of her stays in hospital, Lux being the Latin word for Light. By the time she was proclaimed healthy at the age of three, Lux was never adopted and was placed in foster care. For several years thereafter, she was either fostered out (with the people only doing it for the state check, none of them caring for Lux at all) or living in a place called Sunnyvale. In season one, Lux is introduced as fifteen, nearly sixteen, years old. She tracks down her birth parents Cate Cassidy and Nate Bazzle in order to get them to relinquish their legal rights so she can get emancipated from foster care. Sadly, Lux is refused emancipation by the court and is instead placed into the custody of Nate (Baze) and Cate temporarily. She moves into Cate's home because she has the more suitable home and job. Cate and her fianc√©, Ryan Thomas, who worked with her as morning drive time radio disk jockeys, make up their attic to become her bedroom. Despite signing the papers relinquishing his parental rights, Baze instantly bonds with the daughter he had never known he had; while Cate is reluctant to commit to her (due to her own ongoing issues with her estranged parents). Ryan also bonds with Lux and is also sometimes able to get to the heart of his issues better than her own parents, due to the similarities of their issues (although at times, Lux saw him as a threat to the idea of a happy family she dreams of.) During a family dinner, Lux meets her paternal grandparent. It took time for her to bond with Jack, but she does end up calling him \\"Gramps\\". Eventually, Baze and Cate are granted permanent custody, thanks to the aid of Lux's social worker. Cate decides to marry Ryan after withhold due to mixed feelings about marriage and Baze. (the marriage is later annulled in the second season, upon discovering that Ryan had cheated on Cate with his ex-girlfriend, Julia, who he has a son with) Lux is transferred out of Longfellow High, the school she had been attending, and is transferred to Westmonte High School, where her parents attended (and where her dad's friend, Math works as a teacher). In the beginning of season one, Cate pulled Lux out of Longfellow due to a gang fight that had occurred there. Lux, nonetheless, gets used to the school and makes new friends. Baze owns a bar in season one until it burns down in the season two premiere. Nate aka Baze later starts to work at his father's company and ends up meeting a woman named Emma. They started to date, knowing about the company's policy against dating co-workers. Baze soon finds out that she has a son from a previous marriage, leaving things more complicated then expected. During Thanksgiving, Baze's dad, also the owner of the company, finds out about Baze dating Emma and forces him to choose between Emma his job. Later in the episode, we find out that Emma had slept with Nate's father in the past. Baze lives with his roommate, Math, who was his childhood best friend. Math retains a place in Lux and Baze's life when he later marries Lux's mom's best friend, Alice, who produces the radio show that Cate and Ryan host. In season two, Bug asks Lux to marry him, but she turns him down. Bug then angrily breaks up with her and leaves Portland for good. (Upon Lux telling Baze what happened, he consoles his daughter. Lux then begins a secret relationship with Eric Daniels, a man she meets at the Open Bar, which her father operates and later owns, who is later revealed to be a teacher at Westmonte). Lux is diagnosed with dysgraphia, due to a stroke she suffered when she was a preteen, due to her heart issues. Her past was also shown that she had been sexually and physically abused by a former foster father. His wife, Valerie, lied about it to protect him and not Lux. This revelation angers Baze and his dad, who assaults Trey, the abuser. Eventually, Lux's relationship with Eric is revealed by Emma's son, Sam (Sam had been blackmailing Lux to hopefully get a higher grade in English). He is ordered to quit his job as a teacher and is told to immediately leave Portland on Cate and Baze's orders, punctuating their order by saying they would have him arrested if he tried to contact their daughter ever again. Cate later wants to know what happened between them and why Eric was so important to Lux. Baze finds out that Cate had miscarried her baby with Ryan, discovering that Lux will be the only child that Cate will ever have. This news finally allows Cate and Lux (who had been distant up to that time) to establish a true mother-daughter bond, and she realizes that Cate loves her dearly and will not allow her to be hurt or lonely. Lux also gets her drivers license and shares that joy with her father, Baze and also with Ryan, Math and Jamie. At this moment Lux thanks her dad for a lot of good things that happen in her life since she met him and apologises for telling him about Emma. Baze replies that he could lose anyone in this world except her where they hug. The final scene of the series takes place two years in the future and shows Lux giving the valedictorian speech at her graduation. She and Jones, who loved her from the first time she set foot at Westmonte High are dating. She graduates with her best friend, Tasha Siviac, whom she has known since they were kids in the foster care system. She has a close bond with her paternal grandparents who attend her graduation. Jamie, Fern, Math, and Alice are also in attendance. They are finally the happy family that they and Lux wanted to be. Conception and casting Creator Liz Tigelaar came across the name Lux while reading the novel The Virgin Suicides. Tigelaar used the name in a pilot she wrote which did not get picked up. She then decided to use the name for Life Unexpected. Britt Robertson was cast as Lux in December 2008.

He is best known for featuring on Channel 4 show The Secret Millionaire. He is the Vice- president of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Early life Pearl was born in Luton in October 1945. In the late 1940s his family moved to London's Stamford Hill, where his father Harry worked in a millinery factory. Pearl's family struggled financially; in later life Pearl has referred to this through vignettes, such as his mother keeping gifts to re-gift on other occasions. Pearl left school at the age of 15, with no qualifications, to work as a packer for a clothing company and a part-time casino croupier. Ventures ;Pearl & Coutts In 1965, at the age of 19, he set up Pearl and Coutts, a property management and letting agency. with a partner, beginning by managing other owners' properties. Within three years, Pearl had gone solo and began to buy property to let. The first property had an interest-free mortgage at ¬£7 a week, and was let for ¬£10. For the third property, banks were unwilling to help and his mother provided collateral using her own home. In the early years, Pearl and Coutts operations were characterised by Pearl personally bidding for properties at auctions. Pearl continued personally acquiring and letting properties for ten years from offices in Clarence Road, in London's East End borough of Hackney. Initial properties were residential properties in London's Hackney and Islington, followed by diversification into commercial property in London's central zones and the West End. In 1978 Pearl & Coutts engaged its first permanent employee, Pat Colvin, who had previously worked for NatWest. ;Structadene Ltd In late 1978, Pearl set up a limited company, Structadene Limited, encompassing Pearl & Coutts. Structadene traded throughout the recession at the beginning of the 1980s making some sporadic purchases. During the recession the acquisitions strategy included purchasing properties in areas of London not considered of focal interest for property investment. In 1980, Structadene acquired the Jesus Hospital Estate in east London's Bethnal Green, with 350 houses purchased for ¬£1.2m. Similar acquisitions included various properties on the North side of London's famous central shopping street, Oxford Street, as well as many on the South side. Local property values increased over time and the area became known as Noho in property circles, encompassing the desirable areas of Fitzrovia and many listed buildings. Notable purchases included many buildings along Great Portland Street and Great Titchfield Street. Much of the groups approach has since consisted of joint venture companies. In 2010, there were a reported 200 joint venture style \\"entities\\" comprising the Structadene Group. Gross assets under management have been reported at ¬£2bn \\"at its peak\\", although it is not clear which date this relates to. In 2006, Structadene was ranked no. 65 in The Sunday Times 'Profit Track' list of top 100 companies, with an estimated increase in profits during the period from 2001 to 2004 of 63%. The increase was reported as due to diversifying risk across commercial sectors and spending on IT systems to improve management operations. By late 2007, Structadene's annual report listed 68% portfolio value located in London, with a further 12% in the South East of England. The company had continued to buy properties in London's City areas (EC1, EC2, EC4), Camden and Westminster. Whilst some of the portfolio included buildings for leisure and residential property, the majority was office spaces (40%) and retail units (24%). Properties outside London were geographically diverse across the UK (South West, Midlands, East Anglia, & the North in England; Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Structadene's annual report to September 2008 listed financing with 20 banks/building societies. The Group and share of joint venture turnover was reported at ¬£102,519,735 with Net Assets at ¬£152,020,063 and Reserves of ¬£102,329,048. ;Restructuring In February 2010, Pearl was interviewed by Property Week magazine, due to selling some of the group's properties, a move which went against a longstanding reputation of retaining rather than reselling. Pearl is noted for retaining some of the original properties purchased in the later 1960s. Between October 2009 and February 2010, Structadene sold a reported ¬£50m worth of its portfolio at auction, with a further sale planned that month for 15 more properties. The sales were depicted as part of a strategy to reduce the size of Structadene Ltd by as much as one quarter to one third gradually over five years. The exact level of gearing was not disclosed, with debts estimated at ¬£800m. Auctions were apparently chosen for the method of selling to maximise the sales value. Pearl had not purchased property for over 2 years by January 2010. Business style Pearl's personal approach to business has been documented in various media as keeping as much as possible in-house and a hands-on approach to acquiring property. An interview in The Lawyer in 2003 painted Pearl as an \\"old school\\" businessman favouring a \\"gentleman‚Äôs agreement\\" over routine legal outsourcing. ‚Äò\\"I have 27 joint venture partners and I don't have [legal] joint venture agreements with any of them,\\" he says. \\"We buy properties together. We shake hands, do a deal and that's the way it is\\"‚Äô. Property industry auctioneer Duncan Moir has stated Pearl operates by buying property he genuinely likes, \\"as though he were a collector, rather than an investor\\". Most press coverage of Pearl appears within the property industry media. Notably, Pearl's choice of business attire has been described as \\"perennially dressed down\\", favouring trainers, rugby-style shirts and baggy trousers. A 2006 magazine make-over feature made capital of this, claiming he was \\"famously scruffy\\", spent around ¬£91 a year on clothing and needed the featured sprucing up to attend a charity event at Buckingham Palace. Personal wealth According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Pearl is worth ¬£456 million, an increase of ¬£57 million from 2018. Controversies: legal action and acquisition from local councils In 2007, Structadene Ltd placed a bid for a portfolio of 277 properties with a North London, Islington Council. The properties included many commercial units, such as shops and premises for trades-people providing services. Islington's local press reported that the original value of ¬£45m had been increased by the Structadene bid to ¬£70m, establishing the right to buy 159 of the properties. Many of the traders were worried their businesses may be in jeopardy. Traders were reported to be in fear of rent increases which they felt may put their business at risk, forcing them to either borrow larger sums of money to outbid Structadene to buy or to simply risk losing everything by continuing to rent. There were also complaints that at least 2 traders lost the right to buy as they were unable to meet the deadlines by 2 hours, losing their right to buy due to the need to raise extra finance. Structadene responded with characteristic caution, with a quote from Daniel Parnes, a Structadene director for the local press that \\"for properties where tenants are paying below market rents, we will discuss that with each tenant - we plan to keep the unique nature of the borough\\". In November 2000, Structadene controversially sued inner London local council Hackney Council under the Local Government Act 1972 (123,128). A high court judge found the council had acted illegally in the sale of 12 commercial industrial units to existing tenants at ¬£40,000. Pearl's involvement centred on legal arguments that the council's sale followed refusal to accept an offer of ¬£100,000 from Structadene and thereby contravened the authority's duty to sell to the highest bidder. Mr Justice Elias found in favour and declared the sale void. Pearl was quoted in the national press as \\"furious\\" at the council's failure to accept the higher bid, against a reported background of ¬£40m debt on the part of the local council. Television appearances Pearl appeared in an installment of Channel Four's Secret Millionaire, aired on 12 December 2007. The series featured millionaire-level business people going incognito as volunteers in community organisations within deprived areas, living on very limited budgets. The subterfuge involved pretending to be making a 'regular' documentary within the chosen organisation. At the end of filming, typically one week or so, the millionaire involved gave away tens of thousands of pounds to individuals or organisations they had encountered in their role. The series places an emphasis on both the emotionally compelling stories of the recipients and the psychological impact on the millionaire. Pearl successfully posed as a newly retired volunteer at Portsmouth‚Äôs Queen Alexandra Hospital, which was served by approximately 700 such volunteers. The episode culminated in personal donations totalling ¬£50,000. One recipient was a 'fellow volunteer', to pay for her honeymoon. Others included stroke rehabilitation and cancer care organisations. The subterfuge was probably successful in part due to Pearl's typical dress style, in avoiding arousing suspicions of his actual means. Leisure interests Pearl is Vice-President of premier league football club Tottenham Hotspur. The club was ranked 8th in the premier league 2008‚Äì2009. References * Estelle Maxwell (14 June 2006).
