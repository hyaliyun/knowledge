On August's death in 1819, Alexander was educated in the Cadet Corps in St Petersburg, leaving it in 1834 as a Gardeleutnant. However, four years later, in 1838, he moved to an artistic career and began his artistic training at the St Petersburg Academy under Alexander Sauerweid. He spent six years at the St Petersburg Academy and at the end of them, in 1844, exhibited his first painting, The Storming of Warsaw, in St Petersburg. He then went to continue his studies in Paris in 1846 and to Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany in 1848, before finally settling in Munich. There he became imperial professor of Russian and an honorary member of the Academy of Fine Arts Munich. He painted several large-scale works for the Russian tsar of Russian battles in the Seven Years' War and the campaigns of Alexander Suvorov.

He also led the restoration to working order of several of Britain's steam locomotives after they were replaced by diesel locomotion in the 1960s. Early life Patrick Bruce Whitehouse was born in Warwick, the son of Cecil Whitehouse who was the co-owner of the family construction firm B. Whitehouse and Sons based in Birmingham, West Midlands and his wife Phyllis (n√©e Bucknell), who was a descendant of the founding family of the shipping line that became the Ellerman & Bucknell Steamship Company. Career=RAF: 1939‚Äì1945 Educated at Warwick School, on graduation he was due to join the family firm, but the outbreak of World War II meant that he tried to follow his ambition of becoming a pilot. With less than perfect eyesight, the Royal Air Force approved his training as a navigator, which he completed in Canada under the Empire Air Training Scheme. Returning to the UK he was posted to No. 15 Squadron RAF, completing three tours each of 30 flights over Nazi Germany and occupied western-Europe. Assigned to RAF Transport Command, he was then posted by them to what was consider the less stressful Middle East. Shot down over the Mediterranean, he was the sole survivor of a crew of four, picked up four days later from his RAF issue rubber dinghy by a Greek freighter. By the time of his demobilisation in 1946, he had reached the rank of Squadron Leader. Construction: 1946‚Äì1970 Post-WW2, Whitehouse returned to the family firm, initially becoming number three behind his father and uncle. He succeeded his uncle as Chairman, but sold the business in 1964 to Holland Hannen & Cubbits Ltd. This allowed him to serve on their board until 1971, being appointed OBE in the 1960s for his campaign for safety regulations on building sites.The Times, 17 August 1993 Railway preservation Whitehouse was a member of what later became chronicled as the \\"Birmingham Railway Mafia\\", a group centred around a core of steam railway enthusiasts who were members of both the Birmingham Locomotive Club and West Midlands branch of the Stephenson Locomotive Society. Newly married, Whitehouse bought a Rolleiflex camera, and began chronicling the demise of steam and the railways in some of his favourite railway locations in the West Midlands. These were supplemented by photographs from SLS tours organised by the Birmingham Mafia, including one Whitehouse co-arranged on the Ashover Light Railway, Derbyshire. Inspired by H Fayle's book Narrow Gauge Railways of Ireland, Whitehouse and his wife toured Ireland in the summers of the early 1950s, in 1952 accompanied by fellow publisher Ian Allan, with the group especially enjoying chasing trains along the Tralee and Dingle Railway. These tours are also where Whitehouse met fellow enthusiasts who would later play a key role in preservation of the UK's steam railway heritage, including Ivo Peters, Henry S Orbach and Peter Allen, later knighted for his chairmanship of Imperial Chemical Industries. With a good volume and sufficient personal confidence in his own photographic ability, in the mid-1950s Whitehouse submitted a selected portfolio to the Royal Photographic Society, and in 1958 co-authored with John Powell published a book on the Tralee & Dingle. Talyllyn Railway In 1950, the Talyllyn Railway, a narrow gauge slate railway in mid-Wales, was on the brink of closure following the death of its owner Sir Henry Haydn Jones. A number of railway enthusiasts from Birmingham (known as the \\"Birmingham Railway Mafia\\"), formed a group in an attempt to save the railway. On 11 October 1950, Whitehouse's friend Tom Rolt called a meeting at the Imperial Hotel, Birmingham which led to the formation of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society (TRPS), the world's first railway preservation society. Whitehouse attended the founding meeting and accepted the position of Secretary of the preservation society. He later became vice-president of the society, using his knowledge of civil engineering to help preserve and develop the permanent way, and became a skilled steam locomotive fireman on the line. In the id-1950s, a number of Whitehouse's Talyllyn friends formed a group to attempt a revival of the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales, and Whitehouse contributed to this preservation effort as well. In 1968, a group of business people, including Whitehouse, made an offer to BR to purchase the Vale of Rheidol Railway, which was turned down by the Labour Party government.The Railway Preservation Revolution: A History of Britain's Heritage Railways by Jonathan Brown, p. 52 4555 and the Dart Valley Railway In 1962/3, B Whitehouse & Sons Ltd had been commissioned to rebuild a bridge and walls at Walsall railway station. With the oncoming introduction of diesel and electric services to the area, and subsequent rationalisation and simplification of the required infrastructure, the BR specification changed on numerous occasions resulting in large cost rises. At a subsequent meeting between Whitehouse and the regional manager Stanley Raymond (who as Sir Stanley Raymond, succeeded Dr Richard Beeching as Chairman of the Board of British Railways), the cost issues were resolved, and Raymond asked if he could help Whitehouse with anything else? Whitehouse responded that he wanted to buy a steam locomotive, which after within the room discussions with his staff, Raymond agreed to. Whitehouse and fellow Talyllyn member Pat Garland secured Great Western Railway 4500 Class Small Prairie Tank No.4555 for ¬£750, which included a light overhaul at Swindon Works, a spare boiler, a wagon load of spares and free delivery to Tyseley TMD. Subsequently utilised lightly by BR around the Birmingham area, Whitehouse and his friends wanted to run the locomotive on a GWR branch line. Having originally focused on the already closed GWR Kingswear branch in Devon, with track already being removed they then focused on the Dart Valley Railway from Buckfastleigh to Ashburton. Operated from the outset ‚Äì as had the Talyllyn and the Ffestiniog ‚Äì as a commercial railway, in the first year the Dart Valley carried 60,000 passengers at a profit. Clun Castle and Tyseley In 1965, an agreement was made to purchase Castle Class No.7029 Clun Castle from BR for its scrap price of ¬£2,400. In January 1966 Whitehouse and John Evans donated the remaining amount the fund to allow the transaction to be completed. Clun Castle was purchased by the Standard Gauge Steam Trust. Whitehouse helped secure a lease from BR on part of GWR Tyseley roundhouse which was due to be demolished. The site leased included the coaling stage, ash shelter and watering tower. Dr. Beeching refused permission for the Trust to run their locomotives on the BR mainline so they were limited to the leased motive power depot. The roundhouse later became part of the Birmingham Railway Museum (BRM), a site equipped to preserve and maintain main line steam locomotives. Whitehouse led the team which restored the LMS Jubilee Class No.5593 Kolhapur at the BRM. By the 1970s the BRM housed up to 15 locomotives, and from that time on leased engines to preservation lines throughout Britain. It is now home to the Shakespeare Express which runs on the main line from Birmingham to Stratford. Photographer, writer and publisher In 1952, with Tom Rolt undertaking the writing and Whitehouse contributing the photographs and research, Whitehouse co-authored his first book \\"Lines of Character\\". Five years later he wrote his first solo book \\"Narrow Gauge Album\\", published by Ian Allan Publishing. Whitehouse became the author or co-author of 53 books on railways, and built up a collection of more than a quarter of a million photographs of British and foreign railways. In the 1980s, his travels in China led to a long-standing friendship with the China Railway Publishing House in Beijing, and a treaty of friendship between Birmingham and the north-eastern city of Changchun, Manchuria. Published under the title Millbrook House, the publishers collection of over 250,000 photographs ‚Äì from both those taken by Whitehouse, and the collections he purchased ‚Äì became known as the Millbrook House collection. After his death, the majority of the photographs that he took himself known as the Whitehouse Collection was donated to the nation, acquired by the National Railway Museum. Whitehouse had inherited a Kodak film camera, on which he chronicled his excursions across the UK, Ireland and mainland Europe. In 1956, he produced his first commercial film with John Adams, about the railways of the Isle of Man. Showing the production at a local film club in Birmingham, they met BBC Children's producer Peggy Bacon, who commissioned the pair to present and produce some full-length railway programmes for Children. Whitehouse and John Adams subsequently filmed, produced and co-presented the BBC1 Children's programme Railway Roundabout. Although the films exist still to this day, the programme commentaries and links were live to air and hence not recorded. Film archivist John Huntley estimates the pair were responsible for 137 films, of which around 100 were shown on Railway Roundabout.  Family  His book, China By Rail was co-authored by his daughter Maggy Whitehouse. His son Michael Whitehouse is a lawyer specialising in rail transport, and non- executive director of the Rail Freight Group.

In 1918 he made his debut as an opera singer, under the stage name of Lionello Cecil, performing in the Storchi Theatre of Modena as Duca di Mantova (Verdi's Rigoletto). After his great success, he made a lot of operatic debuts in the other Italian opera theatres and became a leading tenor of the Italian Provincial Houses. In London, while he was on a concert tour, he married Argia Armanda Giustina Mattioni, a ballerina from Trieste, Italy.  Career  Over many years Cecil gave hundreds of performances in opera theatres all over Italy. He also sang outside Italy, in 1926 in South America, and in 1927 in various European countries. He sang leading roles in the first complete microphone recording of Verdi's La Traviata (Alfredo, 1928), and in Puccini's Madama Butterfly (Pinkerton, 1929‚Äì30). He returned to Australia in 1932 to tour with the J.C. Williamson Opera Company, and later took part in a six-month contract with ABC performing live opera.  Later life  Cecil worked for ABC until 1942, in addition to touring, then began teaching. In July 1944 he made his last performance at the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music where he played Canio in Pagliacci. He died on 13 November 1957, in St. Leonards, Sydney.

It used a front engine front wheel drive layout with a two-stroke two-cylinder engine derived from a German DKW design,A to Z of sports cars, 1945-1990 By Mike Lawrence and a conventional metal body.

When General Peron was overthrown in 1955, the project was abandoned leading to the gradual disappearance of the Justicialista. It was later briefly revived as the short lived Wartburg powered Graciela. Overall, the line was sparingly produced and had few sales but was considered important because of its symbolic value to Argentina. Pre-production Peronist Party. Through a decree dated 30 November 1949 and signed by the President of the Argentine Nation, Juan Domingo Per√≥n, took charge of the factory processing of IAME Navy aircraft. In 1953, Brigadier Juan Ignacio San Martin, head of the Aviation Industry and State Mechanical IAME, proposed to President Juan Domingo Per√≥n automobile manufacturing. This metalworking facilities to take advantage of IAME. In order to shorten development times, a rural DKW was imported and its technology was adapted. The original DKW two-cylinder engine had low power and was insufficient for the sedan. Then Magellan Ra√∫l proposed a two-stroke engine but with a \\"V\\" type engine, the solution used in their Austrian factory Puch engines of 125 and 250 cc displacement. Magellan's engine was completely original but with four cylinders, two combustion chambers and a displacement of 800 cc, it was called the M-800. The bodywork was inspired by the 51 Chevrolet and the IAME aeronautical designers gave their particular image. For sports cars, a brand-new technology was applied. Reinforced plastic (polyester) fiber glass, to lower the weight. After several prototypes were developed, a hardtop version 2+2 was released, of which 167 units were manufactured before ending production. Like other domestically produced cars, the Justicialista was made available to the middle and working class. Its production took place in the IAME's complex in the city of Cordoba. The assembly lines were manned by workers who had military in addition to technical training. The managers, themselves, employed military management approach, which rendered the factories as extensions of the barracks.

End of Production In the nearly two years of manufacture, 2300 cars were produced between the Chatito, the vans, and the sedans. It is difficult to identify the breakdown of this figure. However, there are sources that were able to determine the number of manufactured vehicles for some models. For example, it was found that the 1954 IAME Justicialista had a production run of 200 cars and they were built in 1954 until 1955. The new leadership imposed by the de facto national government gave the assembly plant to the national car distributor Porsche and was renamed Teramo.

She founded the Fairfield Methodist Schools, and also Methodist Girls' School in Singapore. She was the first woman missionary sent by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church to Singapore. She also set up a boarding home for girls, supported the early Methodist Straits Chinese Christian work, published a Christian periodical in Baba Malay and is closely associated with the founding of Kampong Kapor Methodist Church. Early life Born 100 miles off Sydney, Australia, Blackmore came from a devout Christian family from London who had migrated south in the 1850s. Her mother's family had had associations with missionary greats such as Robert Morrison, Robert Moffat and David Livingstone while her father was an established solicitor in New South Wales. She was one of eight children. Missionary Work in Singapore=Journey to Singapore Influenced by Isabella Leonard, a visiting American missionary, Blackmore left for India on 10 December 1886 with her mind set on serving China. She was sent under the auspices of the Women's Foreign Missionary Society (WFMS) of the American Methodist Episcopal Church as single women serving as missionaries were unusual and Blackmore's Australian church did not support such a venture. However, Blackmore found no permanent position when she arrived in India. Then in Madras, she met Reverend William Oldham who had gone to India for a conference. This chance meeting opened the doors for Blackmore to contribute to the growing missionary field in Malaya. To prepare for her move, Blackmore took Malay lessons from a family in Moradabad. The couple had previously resided in Singapore. It was also in Moradabad that Blackmore was officiated into the Methodist Episcopal Church.Sophia Blackmore Infopedia Education On her arrival in Singapore on 16 July 1887, Blackmore was encouraged by the Oldhams' work which included the local Methodist Episcopal Church and the Anglo-Chinese School at Coleman Street. Within a month, Blackmore helped open a school for Tamil girls on 15 August 1887, with the support of the Reverend Oldham, several members of the Indian community and a teacher named Alexander Hagedorn (Mrs Alexander Fox). Known originally as the Tamil Girls' School, the school was later renamed the Methodist Girls' School. The school started in a small shophouse on Short Street. By 1925 the school was overcrowded, which precipitated a move to Mount Sophia, where it remained there until 1992 before being moved to its current location.Methodist Girls' School Visiting homes by horse-carriage in the estates bounded by Telok Ayer and Neil Road, she was led to the establishment of a second school for girls. Tan Keong Saik, along with other influential Chinese families, had persuaded her to teach their daughters - an uncommon request as girls were not a priority for education amongst the Chinese then. A widow, Nonya Boon, later offered Blackmore her home along Cross Street to start a school for girls. Beginning with just eight girls, the Anglo-Chinese Girls' School began in August 1888. Under the leadership of Emma Ferris, who was principal from 1892‚Äì1894, the school grew and eventually became the Fairfield Methodist Girls' School. In 1983, the school went co-educational and the school was renamed as the Fairfield Methodist Secondary School. Entrusted with the care of a young girl when she first arrived in Singapore, Blackmore saw the need for a home for girls. Thus on 1 May 1890, a boarding home was set up for girls. First located at Sophia Road, the home moved several times along locations up the hill until its move to a bungalow at No. 4 Sophia Road. The house stood at the pinnacle of the hillock with a bird's eye view of the city. It was known initially as the Deaconess Home because it also housed many single lady missionaries and teachers. It is now more familiarly known as Nind Home (1912) after Mary C. Nind. The home served as a residence to many of the school-going girls and several runaways, mui tsais, abandoned girls and orphans. The Blackmore's girls, as they became known, were nurtured in the Christian faith and became suitable mates for Christian boys from similar homes in Malacca and Singapore. Churchwork To help her in her work, a certain Inche Ismail taught the young Blackmore High Malay. However, a form of market Malay was used as the lingua franca by the various races that poured into Singapore at the turn of the 20th century. Blackmore had therefore to adapt her knowledge of Malay in her work with the Indians, Malays and the Straits Chinese. She became proficient enough in local street Malay to translate hymns, and published the Baba Malay periodical, Sahabat using William Shellabear's printing press. The paper was originally meant for women, but it became so popular that its distribution eventually went beyond Penang. In 1894, Blackmore's home became the base for a Straits Chinese church headed by Goh Hood Keng, beginning with just six members and 16 probationers. Prior to this, Blackmore had already been preaching regularly in Malay on Sundays to girls from the Nind Home, Epworth boys' home and workers from the Missionary Press. Blackmore would accompany Reverend Goh and Dr Benjamin F. West to preach in the open-air at Telok Ayer. By 1901, the blossoming Straits Chinese church had grown large enough to move to the Christian Institute at Middle Road, and eventually moving to Kampong Kapor, when it was renamed the Straits Chinese Methodist Church, and eventually Kampong Kapor Methodist Church. The Kampong Kapor Methodist Church thus traces beginnings to Blackmore's early preaching work in the 1890s. The Bible Women's Training School was organised to train local women to carry on the duties of Christian social work that had already been established. Blackmore was the first to head it between 1901 and 1903. The School trained Eurasian ladies and gradually Chinese women from various parts of Malaya, in home visitation. The Bible Women's Training School was considered ahead of its time in developing local, self-supporting work. Blackmore retired to Australia in 1927 though she did make several visits to Singapore prior to the outbreak of World War II. ReferencesBibliography * Doraisamy, T. R. (Ed.). (1987).

Its strapline is \\"Your Local Station\\". It originally started broadcasting to the South Gloucestershire area on 19 April 2010. It was an extension of Thornbury FM, a smaller station broadcasting to just Thornbury which had started on 19 November 2005. In November 2009, the station relocated its transmitter which increased its coverage area. After an open competition GLOSS FM was chosen as the station's new name in order to be more relevant to all listeners. GLOSS FM legally broadcast under the terms of Ofcom's Restricted Service Licence regime until the spring of 2011. This restricted the station to a maximum of two 28-day broadcasts per year in addition to its webcasts which were broadcast continually. In this year the station closed after an unsuccessful licence bid for a permanent FM frequency which was rejected by Ofcom due to \\"no suitable FM frequency available\\" in the area - an assertion which they have since indicated is not correct. After a 6 year break and several attempts to restart it, the station re-launched on 29 July 2017. About the station GLOSS FM is owned by Thornbury Media CIC, a community interest company, which is similar to a UK limited company except that a profit may not be extracted and all assets are locked within the company for use in the interests of the local community. GLOSS FM's aim is to be \\"Your Local Station\\" For Thornbury and district, South Gloucestershire, providing a community focus for Thornbury and District. This target area is smaller than the original GLOSS FM target area which also encompassed Yate - mainly due to the strong community identity of Thornbury and the fact that its population is increasing. Programming GLOSS FM provides a range of programmes including news, sport, interviews, and music. It broadcasts 24 hours a day on the internet at www.GLOSSFM.co.uk. Technical=FM transmission (Restricted Service Licence) The past RSL transmissions on 87.7 MHz FM were with a comparatively low power of 25 watts ERP. The transmission site was moved in the Summer of 2009 from a low site in Thornbury town centre to a high site overlooking the Severn Vale and across to the Cotswold Way. The resulting coverage area was approximately doubled with this move, meaning that the station covered a potential audience of over 100,000 people in South Gloucestershire from Bradley Stoke in the south, to Berkeley in the north, and from Yate in the East to Chepstow in Wales. These temporary transmissions ceased in 2011 when Ofcom decided there was \\"no suitable FM frequency available\\" for permanent broadcasts. The station re- started discussions with Ofcom in January 2017 about securing a permanent FM frequency. Most of their original technical issues have been cleared, but some remaining regulatory hurdles remain, and the issue is being escalated to the highest levels in Ofcom and Government. It is hoped in 2018 an alternative route to radio broadcasting will become available through Ofcom's \\"Small Scale DAB\\" initiative. This should give an affordable route for small stations to broadcast on DAB which is currently dominated by Arqiva and is excessively expensive. Webstream GLOSS FM streams its output continuously on the Internet. The website has a listen now feature with advanced functionality including album art display, now playing, just played and song voting.

Amber Soja, NIA Senior Research Scientist based at NASA‚Äôs Langley Researcher Center, conducted research that has shown that these more destructive fires have started to impair the growth of pine-dominated forests after fires and are causing some pine forest areas to transition to steppe that stores far less carbon from the atmosphere. Likewise, the research shows that the burns cause more destruction when they occur. According to Soja, in other areas where precipitation is limited to begin with, such as the savannas of Australia, longer droughts might actually reduce the number of wildfires because less vegetation would be available to burn.

The manuscript contains also the lectionary markings at the margin, and numerous pictures (among them portraits of the Evangelists).  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden classified it as Iota text. Kurt Aland placed it in Category V. According to the Claremont Profile Method it belongs to the textual group 22a. It belongs to subgroup 35. It is close textually to the codices: Tischendorfianus IV, Guelferbytanus A, Guelferbytanus B, Nitriensis, 047, 0130, 4, 251, 273, 440, 472, 485, 495, 716, 1047, 1093, 1170, 1229, 1242, 1295, 1355, 1365, 1396, 1515, 1604. Hermann von Soden designated this group by I'.  History  Scrivener dated it to the 11th or 12th century, Gregory to the 11th century. Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 12th century. The manuscript was bought in Constantinople in 1882. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener in the third edition of his A Plain Introduction... in 1883. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1887. Currently the manuscript is housed at the Berlin State Library (Graec. quarto 66), in Berlin.

He was President of the High Court for two days in 1994 before resigning over the Brendan Smyth affair. Attorney general Taoiseach Charles Haughey appointed Whelehan Attorney General of Ireland in the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìPD coalition on 26 September 1991,Oireachtas Sub Committee (1995) p.13 replacing John L. Murray, who had been nominated to the European Court of Justice. Whelehan was retained by Albert Reynolds after Haughey's resignation, and reappointed by the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìLabour coalition after the 1992 general election. X Case In 1992, Whelehan was the Attorney General in the extremely controversial \\"X Case\\", in which he sought an injunction to prevent \\"Miss X\\", a teenager pregnant from a sexual assault, travelling abroad for an abortion to the United Kingdom. This was a test case of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which guarantees the \\"right to life of the unborn\\". In a 2010 documentary, government press secretary Se√°n Duignan said some ministers felt Whelehan should have turned a blind eye to the case. Whelehan expressed regret for \\"the upset, the sadness and the trauma which was visited on everybody involved\\", but felt he had a duty to uphold the Constitution, and that only he had locus standi for the fetus involved. Beef tribunal Whelehan intervened in the Beef Tribunal to prevent Minister Ray Burke being questioned about cabinet discussions on the beef industry. His argument that cabinet confidentiality was paramount was controversially accepted by the Supreme Court. The Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland passed in 1997 loosened this restriction. Brendan Smyth  In March 1993, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) requested the extradition of Brendan Smyth, a priest arrested for child sex abuse. Eight months later, in November 1993, the request was still at the Office of the Attorney General, when the RUC informed the Office that Smyth had voluntarily given himself up in Northern Ireland. In October 1994, a UTV documentary on Smyth suggested the delay in processing the request was deliberate. Whelehan stated he had not known of its existence. The delay was variously blamed on short staffing in the office and the complexity of the case, which might fall under a previously unused provision of the law on extradition.Oireachtas Sub Committee (1995) pp.21‚Äì23 Reynolds later won a libel suit against The Times of London over an article on the affair. Whelehan prepared a memorandum on the Smyth case for the Taoiseach, which was delivered on 15 November 1994. This claimed the case was the first one to involve section 50 of the Extradition Act 1965 (inserted by section 2(1)(b) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act 1987).Whelehan 1994, ¬ß7; High Court appointment and resignation Thomas Finlay retired as Chief Justice of Ireland in September 1994, and Liam Hamilton was promoted from President of the High Court to replace him. In early 1994, when the government was considering forthcoming judicial appointments, Whelehan expressed an interest in becoming President of the High Court and a Judge of the High Court.Oireachtas Sub Committee (1995) pp.13‚Äì14 This was opposed by T√°naiste Dick Spring, leader of the Labour Party, Reynolds' coalition partner; negotiations on a quid pro quo were held in October 1994. On 11 November 1994, while the Brendan Smyth controversy was still in the news, Reynolds appointed Whelehan to the vacancy, at a cabinet meeting from which Labour ministers were absent. Mary Robinson, the President of Ireland, confirmed his appointment the same day, and he took his oath of office from the Chief Justice on 15 November.Oireachtas Sub Committee (1995) pp.14‚Äì15 Over the next two days he heard one case and part of another. In the D√°il on 15 November 1994, Reynolds summarised the report he had received from Whelehan. It was then alleged that an extradition case involving another paedophile cleric, John Anthony Duggan, had been resolved promptly in 1992 after considering section 50 of the Extradition Act.Daniel 2012, pp.109‚Äì114 Whelehan argued that, although section 50 had been considered in the Duggan case, it had not in fact been applied. Reynolds stated he regretted having appointed Whelehan, and The Irish Times reported that Whelehan's successor as Attorney General, Eoghan Fitzsimons, had tried to persuade Whelehan to resign his judgeship. Whelehan rebuffed Fitzsimons, but resigned on 17 November to \\"keep the judiciary out of politics\\". Reynolds ordered Fitzsimons to report on his predecessor's conduct of the Smyth case. The political damage caused the Labour Party to leave the coalition, though without forcing an election; instead it formed another coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. Controversy over Reynolds' unilateral appointment of Whelehan led to the establishment of an independent Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to make recommendations for the government. Later career The rules of the Bar Council of Ireland normally prohibit former judges from working in a court of a level the same as or lower than the court on which they sat.Daniel 2012, p.115 In Whelehan's case, this would have meant he could not work in any court, as the President of the High Court is ex officio a member of the Supreme Court. The Bar Council voted in favour of making an exception to the rule for his case. The Irish Independent in 2007 reported that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board's recommendation of Whelehan for a judgeship had been rejected by Fianna F√°il governments.

Also known as Unit 212 or Sayeret Maglan) is an Israeli sayeret (reconnaissance) unit, which specializes in operating behind enemy lines and deep in enemy territory using advanced technologies and weaponry. Though Maglan is part of the IDF's Commando Brigade, its operators undergo basic training with the Paratroopers Brigade. The unit's name means \\"Ibis\\" (In Hebrew: Maglan). According to one officer, \\"Maglan is a bird that knows how to adapt in every situation.\\" A relatively new unit, Maglan was founded in 1986, but its existence was only declassified in 2006. History Very little is known about the unit, only that the force performs top secret operations behind enemy lines, deep within hostile territory. The IDF keeps Maglan's designated missions a secret and gives no information about it or the operations in which the unit takes part. The secretive unit has clocked-up countless hours of high-risk operations conducted well behind enemy lines‚Äîmost of which have never been declassified. Like Sayeret Matkal, although the operators in the unit wear a red beret, brown combat boots and conduct basic training at one of the paratroopers' bases, they are not part of the Paratroop Brigade. Much like Sayeret Matkal, Maglan reports to the IDF's General Staff and not to one of its regional commands. The unit was active in southern Lebanon during the South Lebanon conflict, and carried out numerous successful missions against Hezbollah. It took part in hundreds of missions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada, particularly in carrying out arrests of terror suspects. During the 2006 Lebanon War, the unit took part in many operations and achieved great success. On 19 July a force from the unit seized a fortified Hezbollah dugout adjacent to the Shaked post; two IDF soldiers and five Hezbollah operatives were killed in the battle.Gal Perl Finkel, The IDF vs subterranean warfare, The Jerusalem Post, 16 August 2016. Operation Beach Boys, later on in the war, saw the unit embedded along the western coastal strip of Lebanon where they destroyed 150 Hezbollah targets, forty of which were rocket launchers.Gal Perl Finkel, Don‚Äôt throw out the baby with the bath water, The Jerusalem Post, 9 August 2018. Maglan oversaw the destruction of command sites, trucks, caches of ammunition and infrastructure. Their activities reduced rocket fire on Israel's northern towns by about 40%. During Operation Protective Edge, the unit took part in combat in the Gaza Strip. On 30 July 2014, three Maglan soldiers, St.-Sgt. Matan Gotlib (21), St.-Sgt. Omer Hay (21) and St.-Sgt. Guy Algranati (20) were killed and 15 others wounded by explosions in a booby-trapped tunnel shaft dug by Hamas.

Training Maglan commandos training in the desert Recruits train extensively for 18 months in what is considered to be one of the most challenging training courses in the IDF. The trainees have 6 months of basic training and advanced training within the Paratroopers Brigade, including a parachuting course. The soldiers then must complete a 60 km (37 mi) beret march (Hebrew: Masa Kumta) to Maglan's base to continue their training. The recruits go through courses in navigation, camouflage, observation, specialized warfare, and special operational devices.

Early life Piantanida was born August 15, 1932, and grew up in Union City, New Jersey. He had a younger brother, Vern. When Piantanida was 10 years old, he experimented with homemade parachutes, harnessing a stray neighborhood cat to one in a test drop off the five-story apartment building where they lived. When a neighbor informed Piantanida's parents of this, Piantanida tested the next parachute himself, jumping off a lower roof and breaking his arm. As he grew older, he took up skydiving with a \\"dogged determination\\", according to his brother. As a young man, Piantanida played basketball in East Coast leagues. This article mistakenly gives Piantanida's date of death as August 25, 1966. After high school, he joined the U.S. Army Reserve and shortly thereafter, the U.S. Army for two years, where he earned the rank of corporal. After his military service, Piantanida and his climbing partner, Walt Tomashoff, became the first people to climb a route on the north side of Auyantepui, the plateau in Venezuela from which Angel Falls drops from a cleft near the summit. For this accomplishment he was interviewed on the Today Show. After his return to the United States, Piantanida worked in an embroidery factory, played basketball at various colleges, and worked as an ironworker on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Skydiving career Strato Jump III gondola at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum In 1963, Piantanida was living in Brick Township, New Jersey, and had a business selling pets when he discovered skydiving. One day after watching jumps at the then new Lakewood Sport Parachuting Center near Lakewood, he began taking lessons and jumping regularly. After making hundreds of jumps and earning a class D expert license, he learned of the jump from a balloon by Yevgeni Andreyev that gave the official world record for the highest parachute jump to the Soviet Union, and determined to bring the world record back to the United States. (The unofficial record, which Piantanida was also trying to break, was held by Joseph Kittinger of the U.S.) Piantanida took a job driving trucks in order to give him time to train on weekends. He earnestly studied meteorology, balloon technology and survival systems. As author Craig Ryan put it, he \\"transformed himself into the director of a one-man aeronautical research program.\\" He obtained money from sponsors, and, after lobbying by a United States Senator, the United States Air Force gave him access to training facilities and David Clark Company loaned him a pressure suit. He assembled a team of volunteers for an attempt at the world free-fall record. On October 22, 1965, Piantanida made his first attempt at the record in his balloon named Strato Jump I. The attempt ended when a wind shear tore off the top of his balloon, ending the flight at just and forcing Piantanida to parachute into the Saint Paul, Minnesota city dump. On February 2, 1966, in his second attempt, Piantanida launched in Strato Jump II from Joe Foss Field near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and reached an unprecedented altitude of . From that height he had planned to parachute from the balloon to set a world record for the highest parachute jump, but was unable to disconnect himself from his oxygen line. He aborted the jump and detached the gondola from the balloon, returning to earth in the gondola without the balloon. Because he did not return to earth with his balloon, his unprecedented altitude is not recognized by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale as a balloon altitude world record, and because he did not jump from the balloon's gondola at 123,500 feet, he earned no parachute altitude record. His third attempt occurred on the morning of May 1, 1966. Piantanida donned a bright orange suit and parachute harness. Secured inside a styrofoam-insulated gondola about the size of a portable toilet, he began his ascent for a planned super-sonic free fall from over 120,000 feet. However, ground controllers listening to the communications link with the Strato Jump III were startled by the sound of a whoosh of rushing air and a sudden, cut-off call over the radio to abort. Piantanida's suit had depressurized at about the 57,000-foot mark. Ground controllers immediately jettisoned the balloon at close to ‚Äì higher than the cruising altitude for commercial jets ‚Äì and for 25 minutes Piantanida's gondola parachuted to the ground. He barely survived the descent, having suffered massive tissue damage due to ebullism. The lack of oxygen left him brain damaged and in a coma from which he never recovered. Piantanida died four months later at the Veterans Hospital in Philadelphia, on August 29. This headline mistakenly says Piantanida was 33 years old. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey. The gondola of the Strato Jump III is preserved and displayed in the Boeing Aviation Hangar at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. Personal life Piantanida was Roman Catholic. He married Janice McDowell in 1963, and they had three daughters: Donna, Diane, and Debbie. A film based on his life, entitled Angry Sky, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 22, 2015, and on ESPN as part of the 30 for 30 series on July 30, 2015.

It belongs to the Atikamekw of Manawan band of the Atikamekw Nation.Indian and Northern Affairs Canada - Aboriginal Community profile: Manawan First Nation The 5-kilometre (3 mile) by 2-kilometre (1¬º mile) reserve is an enclave within the Baie-Atibenne unorganized territory, approximately north of Saint-Michel-des-Saints. It is accessible by gravel road. The reserve takes its name from the Manouane River that has its source nearby. The standardized writing of the Atikamekw language spells it as Manawan, and this form was adopted on January 8, 1991. It means \\"place where they gather eggs\\". Toponymy \\"Manawan\\" means \\"place where we gather eggs\\" in Atikamekw language. The real name of the place where is located the village of Manawan is \\"Metapeckeka\\"\\" which mean \\"where swamps emerge\\" or \\"savannath that emerge from a bay\\". Geography The Indian Reserve of Manawan is an enclave within the Baie-Atibenne unorganized territory in Lanaudi√®re, Quebec. It is located at northeast of Mont-Laurier and it covers an area of . It is linked by a gravel road to Saint-Michel-des-Saints to the south which is the closest service centre. The main city the closest to the village is Montreal. History Atikamekw of Manawan circa 1900 At least since 1850 and probably earlier, the shores of Lake M√©tabesk√©ga were a gathering place for Atikamekw families from Wemotaci. This location, near their winter hunting grounds, was known in the 19th century as Metapeckeka, meaning \\"swamp coming from a bay\\" (from the fact that the lake is often dotted with floating plant debris that winds blew of the banks). Around 1870, logging companies moved into the area, prompting several families to permanently settle on the site. A year later, the Hudson's Bay Company opened its post. But damming of Kempt, Manawan, and Ch√¢teauvert Lakes in the early 1900s inundated the old village. A new village formed downstream at the current site. Establishing a reserve for themselves proved difficult for the Atikamekw. The repeated requests of Chief Louis N√©washish for this portion of their territory were rebuffed by the Canadian Government, saying that the Maniwaki reserve, created in 1850, was reserved for them. The Atikamekw refused to go and live there. The federal government still declined to establish a reserve, arguing that Wemotaci was also for them. After years of correspondence followed by numerous trips in birch-bark canoe to Ottawa and lengthy negotiations for federal services, the government agreed. On August 29, 1906, the Manouane Reserve was officially founded with of land and having some 50 inhabitants.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Manawan The Hudson's Bay Company general store closed circa 1941. The village experienced further growth in the 1950s when more families settled down as a result of growing forest exploitation and the construction of large dams. In 1973, Manawan was connected by road to Saint-Michel-des-Saints.

She is a prominent human rights activist, widely known for her roles in co-founding War Child Netherlands, the European Council on Foreign Relations, Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage, and for having served as the first Chief Executive Officer of The Elders, a grouping founded by Nelson Mandela and chaired by Kofi Annan. In 2005, the World Economic Forum recognised her as a Young Global Leader. Van Oranje is an advisor to several non-profits, including the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, the Malala Fund, Crisis Action and the Open Society Foundations. Early life She was born Mabel Martine Los in Pijnacker, the Netherlands. Her parents were Hendrik Cornelis \\"Henk\\" Los (27 April 1944 ‚Äì 18 February 1978) and his wife Florence Malde Gijsberdina \\"Flos\\" Kooman (b. 1944) (the daughter of Anthonie Kooman (15 June 1915 ‚Äì 8 November 1979) and his wife Antoinette Petronella van Woerkom). After Mabel's father died, when she was 9 years old, her mother married in 1984 Peter Wisse Smit (15 October 1939 ‚Äì 11 November 2000), a Rabobank executive, and Mabel and her sister took their stepfather's surname. Princess Mabel has two younger sisters, Nicoline Los, later Nicoline Wisse Smit (b. 1970) and Eveline Wisse Smit (b. 1982). She grew up in Het Gooi in the central Netherlands. She studied economics and political science at the University of Amsterdam, graduating summa cum laude in 1993. During her studies she also completed internships at the United Nations, Shell, ABN AMRO and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition to Dutch, she speaks fluent English, Spanish and French. During her university years, she showed special interest in human rights situations around the world, and later specialised in Balkan diplomacy and international relations. In 1995 she was present at the peace conference in Dayton, Ohio. Work and activism Wisse Smit was co-founder of the European Action Council for Peace in the Balkans in 1994, which was a non- governmental organisation that strove for peace, democracy and stability in the Balkans, and had Margaret Thatcher, Simon Wiesenthal and Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing among its members. In 1995 she was one of the co-founders of War Child Netherlands, she was on the Trustee Board until 1999. In 1997, she was appointed director of EU affairs of the Open Society Institute in Brussels, one of the foundations of Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros. From 2002 to 2008, Princess Mabel worked in the London branch of the Open Society Institute where she was the International Advocacy Director, to help coordinate all international OSI advocacy activities aimed at international policy change. The World Economic Forum in Switzerland counted her as one of the hundred \\"Global Leaders for Tomorrow\\". She is a member of the worldwide Forum of Young Global Leaders, a thinktank and lobby group that aims to tackle global issues. She is one of the founding members of the European thinktank European Council on Foreign Relations. She is also a member of the Interpeace Governing Council.Interpeace \\"Governing Council\\" Retrieved on 7 February 2012 From July 2008 till May 2012 she was the first Chief Executive Officer of The Elders, a group of eminent individuals convened by Nelson Mandela to use their wisdom, independent leadership and experience to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. She oversaw the day-to-day operations for the Elders. In May 2012, Mabel van Oranje resigned as CEO of The Elders, following the February 2012 accident in which her husband, Prince Friso, was caught in an avalanche and remained hospitalised until his death on 12 August 2013. She continues to be involved with The Elders as a member of its Advisory Council, which she sits on in her capacity as Advisory Committee Chair of Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage. In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation. Controversy After announcing the engagement of Prince Friso with Mabel in June 2003, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende wrote in a letter to parliament that Mabel Wisse Smit had given \\"incomplete and incorrect information\\" about the duration and extent of her contacts with known drug lord, Klaas Bruinsma, and that because of this, the government had decided not to seek permission for the marriage from parliament. In a letter to the Prime Minister dated 9 October, Prince Friso stated that the couple had given some incomplete information, but had not given any incorrect information nor did they lie. The couple admitted that the sailing friendship with Bruinsma was indeed closer than had been mentioned, but denied a love or sexual relationship. This was later repeated by Wisse Smit in a number of interviews. According to Dutch law, the government had to submit the couple's marriage request to parliament for its approval, a prerequisite for succession to the throne. Prince Johan Friso said he would marry Smit regardless, and as a result lost his right to become king. He had been second in the order of succession, after his older brother, Willem-Alexander, the Prince of Orange. In a report later issued by the Stichting Nederlandse Nieuwsmonitor (Dutch News Monitor Foundation),Press statement Stichting Nederlandse Nieuwsmonitor about Mabel Wisse Smit 'Tegen onwaarheid is geen kruid gewassen' it was alleged that the Dutch media had contributed to blowing things out of proportion after the prime minister made 'unnuanced' comments during two news conferences. In this period Wisse Smit also received negative publicity by revelations about her affair, which started circa 1993, with married Bosnian UN Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey. Marriage and children Prince Friso with his wife Mabel and daughters in 2010 Mabel Wisse Smit and Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau married in Delft on 24 April 2004. The couple has two daughters: *Countess Emma Luana Ninette Sophie of Orange-Nassau, Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg, born 26 March 2005 in London, her godparents are Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands (paternal uncle), Eveline Wisse Smit (maternal half-aunt) Baroness Sophie von der Recke (paternal first cousin once removed) and Emma Bonino (parent's friend) *Countess Joanna Zaria Nicoline Milou of Orange-Nassau, Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg, born 18 June 2006 in London, her godparents are Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (paternal uncle); Prince Jaime, Count of Bardi (her father's maternal first cousin) Nicoline Wisse Smit (maternal aunt); Ruben Amerling and Maria Luz Luano (friends of her parents) Because he did not ask the Dutch parliament for permission to marry, Prince Friso ceased being a member of the royal house and forfeited his and his future children's succession rights. Therefore, neither Princess Mabel nor their daughters are members of the royal house. Prince Friso died in 2013. Titles, style, and names Since her marriage, Mabel has used the style of Royal Highness and the courtesy titles of Princess of Orange-Nassau, Countess of Orange-Nassau, Lady van Amsberg. She was not legally created a princess, but it is customary for wives and widows of members of the royal family to take the titles of their husbands. It was decided that their children each would receive the titles of count or countess of Orange-Nassau and jonkheer or jonkvrouw van Amsberg.

The library's principal aim is to make the Swiss cultural heritage more widely available and to assist researchers, who would otherwise have to consult the rare works in situ. Collection The library's initial focus is on prints of the 16th century. That century is considered the golden age of Swiss book printing on account of the many notable bibles, ceremonial prints, research treatises and writings related to the Reformation printed in Switzerland at that time, including works by such luminaries as Vesalius, Paracelsus, Zwingli and Calvin. Exceptional works from that era include the first full Latin translation of the Qur'an (1543). Works from other eras, notably incunables (pre-1501 prints) and 17th century prints, are scheduled to be digitized and added to the library at a later time.

The present church is situated at the East end of the town near the Low Port (entrance to the town). It is located beside the banks of Linlithgow loch and close to the old palace where Mary Queen of Scots was born. Next to the palace is the Parish Church of St Michael's the original seat of the Catholic Church prior to the reformation. This brief history chronicles the Catholic Church in Linlithgow from inception to the present day  History = Introduction  St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church is situated in the historic town of Linlithgow. The present church is situated at the East end of the town near the Low Port (entrance to the town). It is located beside the banks of Linlithgow loch and close to the old palace where Mary Queen of Scots was born. Next to the palace is the Parish Church of St Michael's the original seat of the Catholic Church prior to the reformation. This brief history chronicles the Catholic Church in Linlithgow from inception to the present day.  Early years  The historic town of Linlithgow has a long association with Catholicism in Scotland. Although the present church has been in its current position by the side of Linlithgow Loch for a few years more than a century, St Michael has been associated with Linlithgow since the 13th century. St Michael's Parish church, in the centre of the town next to the remains of Linlithgow Palace, had a long association with the Stuart Kings and Scotland's most famous Queen; Mary Queen of Scots. Mary Queen of Scot's was born in Linlithgow Palace towards the end of 1542 and was baptised in St Michael's Church. Records of the charter of David 11, in which he donated not only the church but also \\"‚Ä¶its chapels and lands, and all other rights belonging thereto‚Ä¶\\", indicate that even in 1138 St. Michael's Church of Linlithgow was of considerable size and influence. Indeed, long before 1242 when David de Bernham, Bishop of St. Andrews, officially St Michaels dedicated this beautiful medieval church it was known as a mother church. Located atop the mound and beside Linlithgow Palace the building stands testimony to the power and influence of pre-Reformation Roman Catholicism. The hierarchy of the Church of St. Michael's Linlithgow did without doubt exert great influence on the daily lives of the population of Scotland although much of this influence was secularised through its links with the Establishment. However, it must not be forgotten that the church was built by local people as a permanent dedication to the greater glory of God. By the 16th century the Church was beset on all sides with calls for reform of various degrees of severity. Moderates, justifiably, wanted internal reform to rid the Church of much that was corrupt. One such was Linlithgow priest Ninian Winzet, who courageously stood up to more militant reformers who wished to see an end to Roman influence. Others were much more militant, for example, John Knox \\"‚Ä¶whose \\"rascally multitude\\" desecrated the church of St. Michael's Linlithgow, among others‚Ä¶\\". To put it mildly, feelings were running high and the outcome was the radical reformation of worship throughout the land. Roman Catholic worship at St. Michael's ended in 1561 when Patrick Frenche, who had been instated in 1559, was replaced by the Protestant minister Patrick Kinloquhy. It is thought that Patrick Frenche fled the country along with his fellow believer Ninian Winzet who was \\"‚Ä¶expelled, banished, and shut out of my kindly toun of Linlithgow and my tender friends‚Ä¶\\". The post-Reformation era saw Roman Catholicism in disarray and the 1567 Act of Parliament criminalising the saying or hearing of Mass means that there is little record of how the faithful met for worship. It is known that there were travelling priests who must have visited the town but little is recorded until much later when the arrival of large numbers of Irish families highlighted the dearth of religious care in Linlithgow. Interior of the church Details of Catholicism in the area remain scarce until around the middle of the 19th century when, as a consequence of the famine in Ireland, there was a large influx of Irish Catholics to Scotland. Many worked in the farms in and around the Royal Burgh during the spring and summer months. However the development of the Shale Oil industry in West Lothian heralded the development of a permanent Catholic population in the town.  The Church on Blackness Road  Designed by Peter Paul Pugin, of the distinguished Victorian firm of architects Pugin and Pugin, the present day building is in the Gothic Revival style. Officially dedicated in 1893, such was the fervor of the then Roman Catholic population of Linlithgow for a permanent place of worship that Mass was first celebrated in the partially completed building on St. Valentine's Day 1888. Although the building and the parish community it represents are now only 108 years old St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church Linlithgow has a long and chequered history. In the late 19th century the many Irish workers attracted to Linlithgow by the promise of jobs in the area's expanding oil shale industry wanted a permanent place to worship. As a result of their petition to the Archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh the first resident priest for around 300 years was appointed. Father Andrew Smith quickly took up their cause and gained permission for Mass to be celebrated on Sundays in the premises of Spence's Tannery located in one of the riggs off the High Street. Soon more suitable premises were found but the Baird Hall, although welcome, was not what the new parishioners wanted for their regular place of worship. Acutely aware of the high cost of building a new church and of how little they could spare from their small incomes they were nonetheless actively engaged in saving for their own premises when their prayers were heard and answered. The appointment of Fr John M. Murphy was very fortuitous indeed since he had trained as a stonemason before being called to the priesthood. A good pastor he quickly associated himself with the needs of his parishioners and \\"‚Ä¶advertised in the 'Glasgow Observer' that he intended holding a grand bazaar, 'to raise funds for the erection of a church dedicated to Queen Mary'.\\" Less than one year after his arrival and with the willing help of the young men of the parish he set about building the church himself. The foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop in 1887. (Indeed, lodged in the archives is the ceremonial trowel beautifully inscribed - \\"Presented to His Grace Archbishop Smith by the Members of the Catholic Congregation, Linlithgow on the occasion of his laying the foundation stone of the Mary Queen of Scots Memorial Church. 14th June 1887\\".) It would appear from reports in the local paper that it was on this occasion that the decision was taken to change the name of the parish from St. Joseph's to St. Michael's and to dedicate the church to St. Michael though still in memory of Mary Queen of Scots, the only church in Scotland so Dedicated. The enthusiasm of the workers and the determination of the parishioners to have their own place of worship can be gauged by the fact that it was just a few short months later that the building was officially opened. Meanwhile, the unfinished parts were bricked up and left until such times as sufficient funds were available. Nothing breeds success like success and filled with enthusiasm at the result of their endeavors and increasingly aware of the needs of their children the congregation capitalised on the spirit of cooperation and community and set out to build a school. Located on a site next to the church St. Joseph's school was opened on 1 July 1889 and served the children of the parish until 1964 when new premises were occupied at Preston Road. Although during this time Fr Easson had replaced Fr Murphy as parish priest there was no change of emphasis and all the parish energies were engaged in the effort to complete the church building programme. Plans to double the size of the church were submitted and it is worth noting that the cost of this enlargement was the princely sum of ¬£1,100. The hopes and dreams of parishioners came to fruition when the Archbishop celebrated a Pontifical High Mass in June 1894.  20th century  St Michael's continued to grow in the early part of the 20th century despite the very hard times brought on the families of St Michaelsthe parish. The Great War and the Depression had a marked effect on a number of the families in the Linlithgow area. The demand for Shale Oil dried up during the depression and many families found themselves with little or no earnings. In 1938 the parish celebrated the 50th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone of the church. Soon after this the Second World War started and many of the men folk left to join the forces. In 1946 the church celebrated the consecration of the high altar. In 1940 Father Michael McGovern became parish priest at St. Michael's. Father McGovern was an untiring priest in his work for the parish and achieved many great things during his 40 years as parish priest. These included the development of the tennis courts and the Queen Margaret Hall. Another memorable development of Father McGovern is the Laetare International Youth Centre which he opened in 1942 (originally a small two bedroomed cottage). During the war the area covered by Laetare served to house Polish Soldiers. During their Stay in Linlithgow they erected a Shrine to the Blessed Virgin. This still stands in the grounds of the church. The church population continued to grow during the later years of the century with the increasing development of Linlithgow as a commuter town for both Glasgow and Edinburgh and with the development of the new industries in and around West Lothian. During the latter part of the 20th century, the parish was served by the late Canon Hugh Gordon and Father James Ferrari. Father Ferrari was parish priest when the church celebrated its centenary. On his retiral Father Ferrari was succeeded by Father Pat Boylan who was succeeded in turn by Fr. Paul Kelly in June 2009  Catholic education  In line with the need to provide Catholic Services in Linlithgow and the surrounding areas, there was a requirement to provide the children with Catholic Education. Initially this was the task of the Sisters of Mercy. In the 19th century the parish was dedicated to St Joseph and so the school took St. Joeseph's as its name. This is still the case today. The church was built in 1242. Classes were originally held in the Baird Hall and Catholic pupils came from other villages close to Linlithgow, many travelling on foot each day. In the 1880s the provision of education was handed over to teachers. Originally there were two teachers for 150 pupils. The first St Joseph‚Äôs school building was completed in 1892 and was situated in the grounds of the Church. The provision of education to the children of Linlithgow was difficult due to the fact that children were often required to work on farms. The health conditions in and around the town often caused further problems for the teachers and on several occasions the school had to be closed temporarily due to infectious diseases. Prior to the end of World War 1, St Joseph's (like other Catholic schools) had not been part of the State School System. This position was changed by the Education Act of 1918. Throughout the early 20th century the School continued to flourish. By 1949 the school roll had grown so much that there was not enough room in the school for all the pupils. Some classes were held in different buildings across the town. At this time the school housed both primary and junior secondary pupils. The more academically gifted pupils attended St Mary‚Äôs in Bathgate. In 1955 the Junior Secondary School moved to new premises in Bo'ness. However this did not alleviate all the accommodation problems and the authorities agreed to build a new St Joseph's Primary School. In 1963 the present St. Joseph‚Äôs on Preston Road was opened and, with the benefit of some welcome enhancements in the 1990s, it thrives there today. With the arrival of the Regional Councils and the introduction of Comprehensive Education the ties with Bo'ness as provide of the junior secondary education ended in the late 1970s. All secondary pupils went to St. Mary's Bathgate. In the mid 1990s, with the closure of St. Mary's, to make way for the new Secondary School in Livingston, Linlithgow pupils changed to St. Kentigern's Blackburn. Today, the teachers of both St. Joseph's and St. Kentigern's work in close partnership with our local Priest and the parents of the parish to provide a thriving Catholic Education for the children.

Nouvel studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and was a founding member of Mars 1976 and Syndicat de l'Architecture. He has obtained a number of prestigious distinctions over the course of his career, including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (technically, the prize was awarded for the Institut du Monde Arabe which Nouvel designed), the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2005 and the Pritzker Prize in 2008. A number of museums and architectural centres have presented retrospectives of his work.  Family and education  Nouvel was born on 12 August 1945 in Fumel, France. He is the son of Ren√©e and Roger Nouvel who were teachers. His family moved often when his father became the county's chief school superintendent. His parents encouraged Nouvel to study mathematics and language, but when he was 16 years old he was captivated by art when a teacher taught him drawing. Although he later said he thought that his parents were guiding him to pursue a career in education or engineering, the family reached a compromise that he could study architecture which they thought was less risky than art. When Nouvel failed an entrance examination at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts of Bordeaux, he moved to Paris where he won first prize in a national competition to attend the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. From 1967 to 1970, Nouvel earned his income as an assistant to architects Claude Parent and Paul Virilio, who after only one year, made him a project manager in charge of building a large apartment complex. Nouvel and filmmaker Odile Fillion married and have two sons, Bertrand, who is a post-doctorate computer scientist working at Mindstorm Multitouch in London, and Pierre, who is a theater producer and designer at his company, Factoid. With his second wife Catherine Richard, Nouvel has a daughter, Sarah. He lives now with Mia H√§gg, who is a Swedish architect working at her practice Habiter Autrement (HA) in Paris.  Practice  Torre Aig√ºes de Barcelona (Agbar), Barcelona By age 25, Nouvel completed school and entered into his own partnership with Fran√ßois Seigneur. Parents sent them work, and gave Nouvel a valuable recommendation to the chairperson of the seventh edition of the Biennale de Paris where for fifteen years, Nouvel designed exhibits and made contacts in the arts and theater. Early on in his career, Nouvel became a key participant in intellectual debates about architecture in France: he co-founded the Mars 1976 movement in 1976 and, a year later, the Syndicat de l'Architecture. Nouvel was one of the organizers of the competition for the rejuvenation of the Les Halles district (1977) and he founded the first Paris architecture biennale in 1980. In 1981, Nouvel, together with Architecture-Studio, won the design competition for the Institut du Monde Arabe (Arab World Institute) building in Paris, whose construction was completed in 1987 and brought Nouvel international fame. Mechanical lenses reminiscent of Arabic latticework in its south wall open and shut automatically, controlling interior lighting as the lenses' photoelectric cells respond to exterior light levels. Nouvel had three different partners between 1972 and 1984: Gilbert Lezenes, Jean-Fran√ßois Guyot, and Pierre Soria. In 1985, with his junior architects Emmanuel Blamont, Jean-Marc Ibos and Mirto Vitart, he founded Jean Nouvel et Associ√©s. Then, with Emmanuel Gattani, he formed JNEC in 1988. Ateliers Jean Nouvel, his present practice, was formed in 1994 with Michel P√©lissi√© and is one of the largest in France, with 140 people in the main office in Paris. Ateliers Jean Nouvel site offices are Rome, Geneva, Madrid and Barcelona. They are working on 30 active projects in 13 countries. Nouvel designed a flacon for L'Homme, an Yves Saint Laurent fragrance, in a limited edition launched in 2008.  Pritzker Prize  Culture and Convention Center (2000) in Lucerne Nouvel was awarded the Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2008, for his work on more than 200 projects, among them, in the words of The New York Times, the \\"exotically louvered\\" Arab World Institute, the bullet-shaped and \\"candy-colored\\" Torre Agbar in Barcelona, the \\"muscular\\" Guthrie Theater with its cantilevered bridge in Minneapolis, and in Paris, the \\"defiant, mysterious and wildly eccentric\\" Mus√©e du quai Branly (2006) and the Philharmonie de Paris (a \\"trip into the unknown\\" c. 2012). Pritzker points to several more major works: in Europe, the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art (1994), the Culture and Convention Center in Lucerne (2000), the Op√©ra Nouvel in Lyon (1993), Expo 2002 in Switzerland and, under construction, the Copenhagen Concert Hall and the courthouse in Nantes (2000); as well as two tall towers in planning in North America, Tour Verre in New York City and a cancelled condominium tower in Los Angeles, In its citation, the jury of the Pritzker prize noted: > Of the many phrases that might be used to describe the career of architect > Jean Nouvel, foremost are those that emphasize his courageous pursuit of new > ideas and his challenge of accepted norms in order to stretch the boundaries > of the field. [...] The jury acknowledged the 'persistence, imagination, > exuberance, and, above all, an insatiable urge for creative experimentation' > as qualities abundant in Nouvel's work.

Canada In Canada, Turner Classic Movies was debuted on November 1, 2005, on the Shaw Cable system and Shaw Direct satellite service. Rogers Cable started offering TCM on December 12, 2006 as a free preview channel for all digital customers, and added it to the \\"Ultimate TV\\" analogue package on or around February 1, 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian channel is generally the same as the US channel, some films are replaced for broadcast into Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Europe, the Middle East and Africa In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, TCM Movies was available as ten separate channels for Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, France/Switzerland/Belgium, Germany/Switzerland, Greece/Cyprus, Italy, Middle East, Nordic countries, Spain, the UK/Ireland/Malta, and a panregional channel with various feeds in different languages for the Nordic countries, Benelux and other countries. While in Poland it was introduced in 1998 until October 6, 2015 as part of the WizjaTV platform along with a local version of Cartoon Network, the European feed was launched in 1999 until January 1, 2014, when its predecessor, the international version of TNT dropped its film programming to become a general entertainment channel. Its penetration increased when it took over TNT's space on various platforms in 1999 and 2000. In Romania, Turner Classic Movies aired after Cartoon Network on the same channel from 10:00 PM, local time. In Britain, Turner Classic Movies 2 launched on May 2, 2006. The channel, which is a spin-off from the UK version of Turner Classic Movies, focuses mainly on the bigger films from the MGM and Warner film archives including Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, North by Northwest and Meet Me in St. Louis, among others. The channel closed on August 13, 2013 and was replaced with Turner Classic Movies +1. In December 2013, the pan-European channel closed in Portugal. In September 2013, Turner Broadcasting System revealed its plans to close down the pan-European channel for the Benelux market. The channel closed on 1 January 2014. On 1 June 2017, TCM Europe closed down in all of the Nordic countries. On August 2018, The MENA feed has dropped (Turner Classic Movies) tag and unveiled a new logo. The African TCM was rebranded to TNT in September 2018. In 2018, Greece has relaunched TCM again and was broadcasting on Cosmote, and broadcast in HD by 2019. On April 2019, TCM MENA became HD on beIN in the MENA Region. On 1st August 2019, Turner Classic Movies was rebranded to TCM Movies in United Kingdom. Currently, TCM is only available in the UK and Ireland, Spain, France, Switzerland and Belgium and the Middle East, North Africa, Greece, and Cyprus. Asia-Pacific In Asia-Pacific, TCM Classic Movies was available as one feed that serves more than 14 territories. It was available in India until March 2, 2009 exclusively on Dish TV along with Boomerang. It is available in India on Tata Sky from August 2009 (Channel No. 357). It closed in January 2019. Latin America TCM was also available in Latin America, but this version receives little attention unlike the US and Europe, Middle East and Africa counterparts. This version in Latin America was called TCM Classic Hollywood until mid-2009. Starting on April 1, 2009, TCM Latin America was renamed TCM Classic Entertainment and started airing most of the programming from the former channel Retro, also owned by Turner Broadcasting System, and which also aired classic series and movies.

Angelik Caruana is a resident of Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a in Malta who has reported a series of visions of the Virgin Mary since 21 April 2006, including a number of times at a hill in Borƒ° in-Nadur where he delivered monthly messages to the public. Caruana originally made headlines in 2006 when he claimed that a statue of the Virgin Mary in his home was weeping blood and oozing oil. The blood was later identified as Angelik's own and the oil as burnt cooking oil. The Borƒ° in-Nadur site sometimes received more than 200 visitors, and Caruana has a number of followers who circulate his messages through newsletters and the internet. In January 2016, the Catholic Church decreed that Caruana's messages were not divine in nature, and should not be promoted. The curia were particularly concerned over Caruana's \\"monetary gain\\" from the reported apparations, and two cases where Caruana had told cancer patients that their illness has been cured, only for them to die weeks later. History Cross, statue and tree on the top of Borƒ° in-Nadur Hill around the year 2018. In January and April 2006, Caruana reported that a statue of the Virgin Mary in his house in Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a was issuing tears of blood. Mrs. Caruana had felt so drawn towards the statue while it was on display in a Birzebbuga pet shop, that she immediately purchased it and placed it in a prominent place in her residence. Three days later, on the 23rd January, tears of a red liquid oozed from the statue.Conti, Alexia. \\"'Weeping' Virgin Mary statue bought from pet shop\\", Malta Media, April 23, 2006 In April that year he reported his first vision of the Virgin Mary in a local church, in which she referred to herself as the \\"Immaculate Conception and the Queen of Peace and the Family\\" and asked for the urgent conversion of Maltese families, and prayer for the conversion of the people of Iran, Russia, America, China and Australia. Apparitions began to occur more regularly, although without any pattern, and in June 2006, Caruana reported apparitions on the 19, 23 and 30. Father Hayden Williams was notified of the events and became Caruana's spiritual director under his own initiative, without the support of the church, accompanying him on many occasions during his apparitions. Starting in December 2006, Caruana was reporting weekly apparitions on a hill at Borƒ° in- Nadur, which he described as \\"the special place Mother Mary has chosen for the apparitions\\". These apparitions included conversations with the Virgin Mary, visions of souls in Purgatory, vision of the Archangel Uriel, Satanic attacks, mystic visions of Jesus on the Cross, the apparition of the Eucharist on Caruana's hands and his subsequent Holy Communion, and visions of other supernatural phenomena. During a vision on February 28, 2007 on Borg in-Nadur Hill, Angelik Caruana is reported to have said the Madonna told him she is appearing in Malta because she wants people to accept her son again.\\"More Madonna visions claimed at Borg in-Nadur\\", Malta Media, March 11, 2007 The public messages Caruana gives on Borƒ° in-Nadur Hill are now recorded live by the priests accompanying him, and are read out to an audience. All the messages are also posted to an official website. Lengthy messages start out with \\"My dear children\\" where Caruana greets the listeners as the Virgin Mary's children. Caruana's messages have directed the pilgrims present to meditate on the rosary daily as the means to acquire peace, and have said that Mass is more of a necessity than visiting the site of Borƒ° in-Nadur, although Caruana has said that he believed the Virgin Mary wanted the people to visit the site and pray as \\"it is a special place that she herself has chosen\\". In 2010, Caruana was directed by the Virgin Mary to travel to Gozo, Malta's sister island where he described further apparitions from her at a site in Xewkija. In 2011, Caruana travelled to the Vatican, where it was reported he climbed over a security barrier to interrupt a general audience with Pope Benedict XVI, in order to personally deliver a letter containing \\"devotional messages\\". Caruana was escorted from the venue by Vatican security.\\"Updated: Angelik Caruana in Vatican incident\\", Times of Malta, January 26, 2011  Other visions  Archangel Uriel is a guardian angel who Caruana describes as being visible only to him. Caruana has spoken of how the angel can transport his soul to different places. On a particular occasion, Caruana described how his soul was transported over five hundred miles to Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Uriel reportedly ministers the Eucharist to Caruana. Several witnesses have reported the Eucharist appearing out of nowhere, with Caruana receiving it in his hands and subsequent Holy Communion. Caruana talks of communing with souls from Purgatory, who ask for intercession so that they might be transferred to heaven. The visits from the souls in Purgatory include a re-visitation at the time of their entrance in heaven, when Caruana is able to witness them entering the pearly gates. Caruana considers it important to pray for the departed. St. Francis of Assisi has also appeared in Caruana's visions, and has spoken to him about the need to \\"radically change the Church from the inside\\". Caruana reports experiencing pain related to Jesus' sufferinƒ° Every Friday, he describes feeling the five wounds of Jesus during the Crucifixion, and occasionally the crown of thorns and the flagellation. Caruana believes that the Virgin Mary has told him that one day he will also demonstrate visible stigmata of these injuries. Caruana has described several demonic attacks on his person, and has experienced three visions of Hell. In the first vision, the Virgin Mary's hands emitted a blazing fire that extended between the cross and the bronze-age wall, passing through an assembled crowd of the damned, who Caruana saw to be blaspheming and fighting one another. Within the flames and among the people Caruana perceived many devils that had the shape of humans and animals, who began to mock the people while hovering above them. Fr. Hayden reported Caruana as asking \\"Why is it Lady that you are now showing me hell?\\" Caruana experienced a similar vision in July 2008, causing him to weep, and request a sign from the Virgin Mary. He reported her reply as a request that she would only issue such a sign following sufficient conversion.  Messages from the hill  Caruana and followers on Borƒ° in- Nadur Hill around the year 2010. Some of the messages recorded by Caruana take the form of teachings, on subjects such as the existence of Satan, the rejection of Halloween as an American \\"party\\" tradition, and the variety of sins which will condemn a soul to Hell, including abortion, divorce, euthanasia, pornography, drug abuse, child abuse and premarital sex. Modern attitudes to marriage have been singled out for particular concern, with Internet pornography and workplace sexual harassment being cited by Caruana as breaking up many thousands of families, and divorce being a source of \\"disorder and confusion\\", with children becoming \\"as though orphans\\". Speaking on behalf of the Virgin Mary, Caruana has expressed messages of support for Malta's anti-abortion perspective, saying that only \\"those who have cast aside Jesus Christ can regard abortion as a good thing\\". He has also spoken of the dangers of drug abuse, which cause those around the abuser to suffer, and which he describes as a means of \\"Satanic rule\\". The Virgin Mary's suffering in relation to mankind's wrongdoing is frequently mentioned in Caruana's messages. In 2010, Caruana began to speak on apocalyptic themes, quoting the Virgin Mary in saying that \\"the time of darkness and tribulation\\" was near, and that Malta was fortunate to have Caruana passing on messages from Jesus via Mary. Religious conversion is a recurring theme in the messages recorded by Caruana, who calls for an \\"urgent conversion\\" from all the countries of the world, particularly Iran, Russia, America, China and Australia. Caruana has given messages which predict future events relating to the apparitions. On the 5 of August 2009, Caruana reported that the Virgin Mary had promised that miraculous water would issue from the plant at by the foot of the cross at Borƒ° in-Nadur Hill, \\"for two whole years\\". In June 2010, Caruana reported another message about the promised miraculous stream of water from the plant and said that the time when this will happen was \\"not far off\\". Again on 4 August 2010, a year after the first prediction, Caruana reported a message from the apparition which said \\"the time is fast approaching! The time for which my Son Jesus has sent me is near. Indeed, my children, soon the flow of water up here will be created.\\" On 4 August 4, 2011, according to Caruana, the Virgin Mary was said to have promised a spring that would provide water that will heal the sick.\\"Birzebbugia mystic delivers Virgin‚Äôs message to ‚Äòserve and love‚Äô priests\\", Malta Today, August 19, 2011 Investigations Fr. Hayden Williams O.F.M. (Cap) accompanied Caruana in an unofficial capacity since the start of the alleged visions in 2006, to February 2013, when his were duties were passed to Fr. Anton Gouder. The Church has made it clear that Fr Williams was not assigned by the Archbishop but took up the position under his own initiative. In 2009, after Caruana had claimed to possess a statuette of the Madonna which wept blood and leaked oil on his kitchen table, a forensic investigator and a pathologist were commissioned by the Archbishop to investigate the claims. Tests on the substance showed it to be ordinary cooking oil, with the \\"blood\\" being a burnt form of the oil. The Archbishop's Curia investigated another case where Caruana reported blood on the face of a statue of the Madonna, and although the substance was shown to be human blood, an expensive forensic investigation identified it as Caruana's own. In October 2012 church authorities in Malta issued a directive that phenomena and messages such as those alleged to occur at Borg in-Nadur were no longer to be announced and interpreted in the public fora. ‚Äú...[I]n a spirit of discernment and evaluation of these alleged phenomena and messages, the authorities of the Church in Malta feel that the time is ripe to issue this directive‚Äù. Furthermore, the church said that, Angelik Caruana will only attend activities at Borg in Nadur on the 26th of every month.\\"Church issues directive on alleged 'phenomena and messages'\\", Times of Malta, October 12, 2012\\"Curia orders mystic to refrain from issuing messages from alleged apparitions\\", Malta Today, October 12, 2012 In 2016, the Archbishop's Curia issued a decree, signed by Archbishop Charles Scicluna, concluding that Caruana's messages were neither divine nor supernatural. The decision was reached following consultation with the College of Consultors and the Bishop of Gozo Mario Grech. The curia were concerned over Caruana receiving monetary gain from his reported apparations, as Vatican policy is that \\"genuine apparition cases should not be linked to some monetary gain\\". Concern was also raised over a number of cases of \\"false miracles\\" claimed by Caruana, with two instances where he had told cancer patients that their illness has been cured, only for them to die within a month. The decree advised that \\"Priests, male and female religious, Catechists and all the Christian faithful are to refrain from the promotion, in any way whatsoever, of the said alleged apparitions, the said alleged messages and the other alleged mystical phenomena related to this case.\\" ReferencesExternal links *The Apparitions of the Lady of Borg in-Nadur *Allegations of Fraud reported by Illum *Angelik gave cancer sufferers false hope with miracle cure, Church says, Malta Today Category:Living people Category:Maltese men Category:Maltese Roman Catholics Category:Marian visionaries Category:Angelic visionaries Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a ","title":"Angelik Caruana"},{"id":"26576942","text":"Strong House or Strong Hall may refer to a fortified house, or to houses named after owners called \\"Strong\\", including the following: *Strong House (Coventry, Connecticut), listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) *Strong-Davis-Rice-George House, Eatonton, Georgia, listed on the NRHP in Putnam County *Fernand-Strong House, Lawrence, Kansas, listed on the NRHP in Douglas County *Strong Hall (Lawrence, Kansas), NRHP-listed *Strong House (Amherst, Massachusetts), NRHP-listed *Strong's Block, Newton, Massachusetts, NRHP-listed *William Strong House (Preston, Minnesota), listed on the NRHP in Fillmore County *Rau/Strong House, St. Paul, Minnesota, NRHP-listed *William Strong House (Spring Valley, Minnesota), listed on the NRHP in Fillmore County *Richard Strong Cottage, Dublin, New Hampshire, NRHP-listed *Capt.

The ancient site lay on a spur from the hills that close the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, next to which towards its south being the tell, Khirbet Kerak or Bet Yerah,Conder, C.R.; et al.

The name Sinn en Nabra still exists, and is well known to the natives; it applies to a ruin situated on a spur from the hills that close the southern end of the Sea of Galilee; it formed, therefore, the defence against an invader from the Jordan plain, and blocked the great main road in the valley. Close beside it there is a large artificially-formed plateau, defended by a water-ditch on the south, communicating with Jordan, and by the Sea of Galilee on the north. This is called Kh. el Kerak, and is, I have not the slightest doubt, the remains of Vespasian's camp described by Josephus.\\" one of the largest in the Levant, spanning an area of over 50 acres.The Holy Land: An Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700, Jerome Murphy O'Connor, Oxford University Press, 1980, p.159 Bet Yerah was the Hellenistic era twin city of Sennabris (),Midrash HaGadol (Genesis Rabba 98:22)Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 1:1 (2b) as al- Sinnabra was known in Classical antiquity, and its remains are located at the same tell. The city or village was inhabited in the Hellenistic, Roman- Byzantine, and early Islamic periods. An Arab Islamic palatial complex or qasr located there was also known as al-Sinnabra and served as a winter resort to caliphs in Umayyad-era Palestine (c. 650-704 AD).Whitcomb in Schuzman, 2009, p. 241. By the Crusader period, the qasr of al-Sinnabra was in ruins. Though the date of destruction for the village itself is unknown, by the Ayyubid period descriptions of the area mention only the \\"Crusader Bridge of Sennabris\\", constructed over the Jordan river which at the time ran to the immediate north of the village. For decades, part of the palatial complex of al-Sinnabra was misidentified as a Byzantine era (c. 330-620 CE) synagogue because of a column base engraved with a seven-branched candelabrum. This thesis was questioned by Ronny Reich in 1993. Donald Whitcomb suggested the complex was the qasr of al-Sinnabra in 2002,Whitcomb in Schuzman, 2009, p. 246. and excavations carried out in 2010 showed his analysis to be correct. Constructed in the 7th century by Mu'awiya and one of his successors, Abdel Malik, who also commissioned the building of the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem, it likely represents the earliest Umayyad complex of this type yet to be discovered. Name In Greek (Hellenistic) sources the name is given as Sennabris, while in the Aramaic used in Talmudic sources it is referred to as Sinnabri, and is described as sitting alongside Bet Yerah. The Arabic rendering of the name is al-Sinnabra or Sinn-en-Nabra. Location Though described in the writings of early Arab historians, the precise location of al-Sinnabra had long been unknown. Josephus, the 1st-century Jewish historian, described Sennabris as the northernmost point of the Jordan valley, situating it some 30 stadia to the south of Tiberias.Josephus, Wars of the Jews (book iii, chapter ix, ¬ß 7 In Buldan, Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179‚Äì1229), the Syrian geographer, situated al-Sinnabra opposite 'aqabat Afiq (meaning \\"the Afeq pass\\"), from Tiberias.Gil, 1997, p. 78, footnote #5. Location of Sennabris on 1903 map Josef Schwarz, a rabbi who came to reside in Jerusalem in the 19th century, transliterated its name as it appears in the Talmud as Senabrai, and citing Josephus for its location, he noted that \\"Even at the present day there are found in this vicinity traces of ruins called by the Arabs Sinabri.\\" A map of the area produced by the Palestine Exploration Fund around this time depicted Khirbet Sinn en-Nabrah to the immediate northwest of Khirbet Kerak, in an area occupied in the present day by the settlement of Kinneret. Al-Sinnabra's location is now confirmed to have been off the main Ramla-Beisan-Damascus highway about south of Tabariyya (the Arabic name for Tiberias), a city that served as the capital of the el-Urdunn province under the Umayyad dynasty. It is situated on the tell of Khirbet Kerak (Arabic: Khirbet al-Karak, \\"the ruins of the castle\\") or Beth Yerah (, \\"House of the Moon (god)\\"), which lies where the Sea of Galilee empties into the Jordan river and rises 15 meters above sea level. The Jordan river runs to the south, although it previously (until the medieval period at the earliest) ran north and west of it. History=Hellenistic period In Hellenistic times, the city was known as Sennabris. Parts of the city walls from this period have been identified, and it is estimated that the wall (on the south and west of the tel) was at least 1600 meters long. The wall was built of piles of basalt, with bricks at the top and was strengthened by alternating rectangular and rounded towers with spiral staircases. Similar towers from this period have been found at Tel Zeror. A portion of the town discovered in the southern part of the mound included a street along which houses were built, one of which had a paved court around which were eleven rooms. Some of the houses facing the lake have survived to the height of the window sills. Roman-Byzantine period A depiction of the location of Sennabrin in the ancient Galilee, as recorded in The Historical Atlas (1923) by William R. Shepherd According to Josephus, Vespasian encamped with three Roman legions in Sennabris, in preparation for an assault on Tarichaea. He describes it as a \\"village,\\" but given the size of the Roman force stationed there, this seems to be an understatement. A fort was constructed at this time, probably by the builders of the Sixth Legion,Chancey, 2005, p. 67. as well as a road connecting Tiberias to Sennabris, via Bethsaida and Hippos. According to the Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 1:1 [2b]), both Sennabris and Bet Yerah once produced kinarƒ´m, a word explained by Talmudic exegete Moses Margolies to mean \\"reeds\\", but by Jastrow to mean \\"Christ's thorn jujube.\\"Marcus Jastrow (ed.), A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli, and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic literature (2nd edition), New York/China 2006, s.v. ◊õ◊†◊®◊ê (p. 651) . A large Byzantine era church was constructed in the village in 450 CE and underwent several renovations, the last of these dated to 529 CE. The church shows signs of renewed habitation in the early Islamic period, when it possibly served as a dar, or manor house. Early Islamic period The village gained importance under the rule of the Umayyad empire, A qasr (Arab Islamic palatial complex) located in al-Sinnabra and known by the same name, served as a winter resort to Mu'awiya, Marwan I, and other caliphs in Umayyad- era Palestine (c. 650-704 AD). Mu'awiya (602-680), the first caliph, settled in al-Sinnabra, dividing his time in Palestine between his residence there and Jerusalem.Gil, 1997, p. 78.Noted by Yaqut al-Hamawi, see le Strange, 1890, p. 531 Innovations he introduced to the palace structure at al-Sinnabra include the maq·π£ura, \\"a columned bay ... enclosed by a railing or screen\\" against which the caliph would lean to hear petitions from his subjects, and a mihrab associated with the apsidal form.Whitcomb in Schuzman, 2009, p. 245. According to Whitcomb, the qasr is likely the earliest Umayyad complex of this type yet to be discovered. It differs from other qusur (pl. of qasr) in that there are no buy≈´t (\\"houses\\") arranged around a central courtyard, suggesting either a more urban design, such as that found at 'Anjar, or a more palatial one, like that at Qasr ibn Wardan. It is similar to other qusur in that it exhibits characteristics associated with the pre-Islamic building techniques used by Arab chieftains of the Byzantine era. Later Umayyad caliphs also came to al- Sinnabra. Caliph Marwan I () twice held council there: the first was in 684, while on his way from Damascus to Egypt, to address complaints from his loyalists; the second was on his return trip in 685 to designate his eldest son, Abd al-Malik, as his chosen successor and the governor of Palestine. Marwan may have remained there until his death later that year. Abd al-Malik (), who emulated many of Mu'awiya's practices, resided part of the year in Damascus and Baalbek, and would spend the winter season in al-Sinnabra and in al-Jabiya in the Golan, making it one of the four early capitals of the ruling Marwanid house of the Umayyad dynasty. He died in al-Sinnabra in 705. An Umayyad prince and former governor of Khurasan until 698, Umayya ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, retired and died in al-Sinnabra during the reign of Abd al-Malik. In 744, an army headed by Sulayman ibn Hisham, a general of the Umayyad Caliphate sent by Caliph Yazid III to quell resistance to his rule, reached al-Sinnabra, where the tribes of Urdunn came to pledge their loyalty to the caliph before him.Gil, 1997, p. 86. The site was apparently still in use in the 10th century; in 979 a meeting between Abu Taghlib (Fadlallah b. al-Hasan) of the Hamdanid dynasty, and Fadl, son of Salih, a Jew who headed the Fatimid forces took place there.Gil, 1997, p. 355. Crusader period During the Crusades, the army of Baldwin I, one of the leaders of the First Crusade, was defeated there in the Battle of Al-Sannabra in 1113 by the armies of Mawdud, the atabeg of Mosul who had formed an alliance with forces from Damascus. In the lead up to the Battle of Hittin in 1187, Saladin and his forces passed through and set up camp near the village, before moving on to command the roads around Kafr Sabt. The Umayyad qasr was in ruins by this time. In the dried out river bed where the river used to flow at this time, the remains of the \\"Crusader bridge of Sennabris\\" were found. Ayyubid period The exact date of the village's destruction is unknown, but it is thought that it did not survive beyond the period of Ayyubid rule (c. late 12th-early 13th centuries) as references to al-Sinnabra from this time mention only the bridge of the same name, without recalling the village. Excavations and identification In 1946, in the northern quadrant of the tell, a fortified compound consisting of a series of large structures, including a bathhouse adjoined to a large apsidal hall decorated with colorful mosaics, was discovered just above the granary (AKA the Circles Building), an Early Bronze Age structure uncovered in previous excavations. Between 1950 and 1953,P. Bar-Adon, Beth Yerah (News and Notes), IEJ, vol. 3, pp. 132, 1953P. Bar-Adon, Beth Yerah (News and Notes), IEJ, vol. 4, pp. 128-129, 1954P. Bar- Adon, Beth Yerah (News and Notes), IEJ, vol. 5, pp. 273, 1955 P.L.O. Guy and Pesach Bar-Adon, two Israeli archaeologists excavated the compound, falsely identifying a building there as a 5th-6th century Palestinian synagogue, because of the presence of a column base engraved with a seven-branched candelabrum. The \\"synagogue\\" was incorporated into the Beth Yerah National Park which served as a popular tourist destination during the 1950s and 1960s, but has since been closed. Excavations by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in 1960 uncovered the Byzantine church (to the north of the compound). Questions were repeatedly raised about the identification of the structure to the south as a synagogue within a Roman era fort with attached bathhouse. Ronny Reich, a prominent Israeli archaeologist, disproved that thesis in 1993, without offering an alternate explanation as to its identity. Correct identification The compound, until 2002 identified as \\"Roman-Byzantine\\", was hypothesized to be the palace of al-Sinnabra by Donald S. Whitcomb of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, after re- examining the plan and architectural features provided in the descriptions made by Israeli excavators. Noting the similarities between the features of the complex and those of Khirbat al-Mafjar, another Islamic era palace near Jericho, he suggested the site was one of the so-called desert castles (sing. qasr; pl. qusur) of the early Islamic Levant. By comparing this information against the descriptions provided in historical geography texts, Whitcomb determined that the complex at Khirbet Kerak was indeed the Arab Islamic palace of al-Sinnabra. Dating Whitcomb's thesis was confirmed following research conducted by Taufik De'adle of the Hebrew University and excavations undertaken by Israeli archaeologists headed by Raphael Greenberg from Tel Aviv University's Institute of Archaeology in 2010. Coins found at the site and its foundations indicate that the central building was built no earlier than 650 CE and that the bathhouse attached to the outer wall dates to the end of the 7th century. The foundations of the compound are made up of thick wall-stubs over two meters deep and provide an idea of the layout of the palace, the bathhouse and the wall and towers that surrounded them. The remains of water conduits and ceramic pipes from the bathhouse attest to the existence of a sophisticated water-distribution system, fed by an aqueduct. Greenberg said that al-Sinnabra and other sites that are in the process of being similarly re-dated indicate an architectural continuity between the Roman and early Arab empires.

He made 15 appearances for Roma in the 1974‚Äì75 Serie A season, scoring twice, and played 71 times in Serie C for Messina and Cosenza. Life and career Curcio was born in 1953 in Sant'Angelo di Brolo, in the Province of Messina, Sicily. As a youngster, he played local football for Orlandina before joining Messina, where he made his senior debut on the opening day of the 1972‚Äì73 Serie C season in the starting eleven for a goalless draw away to Trani. Curcio finished the season with 13 appearances as his team were relegated, but the following season scored four goals from 23 appearances as Messina won their section of Serie D. His performances earned the 21-year-old Curcio a move to Roma of Serie A. Head coach Nils Liedholm gave him his debut as a second-half substitute on the opening day of the 1974‚Äì75 season in a 1‚Äì0 defeat away to Torino; his introduction livened up the attack, but made no difference to the score. He made two more appearances in 1974 and, after some muscle problems, made an unexpected return to the first team for the visit to Vicenza on 5 January 1975. Demonstrating pace, trickery and clean shooting, he scored both goals in a 2‚Äì0 win that extended Roma's winning run to five and earned him a run in the side. He finished the season with 15 appearances from a possible 30, but no more goals. Because of industrial action, the regular football highlights were not broadcast for the weekend of Curcio's goals against Vicenza. However, film still existed in the archives, and in 2011, Curcio was a guest on Rai 2's when his goals were aired for the first time. Curcio joined Alessandria at the start of the 1975‚Äì76 season, but in three months he played twice in the Coppa Italia Semiprofessionisti and not at all in Serie C. Interviewed some 40 years later, he recalled believing he was not good enough, and that Roma's reasoning for moving him on was that with him in the team, they finished third, but with someone better in his place, they could win the title. In November, he joined another Serie C side, Cosenza, where he played more regularly. He scored three goals from 58 appearances over 18 months in Serie C, and a further six goals from 21 appearances in Serie D in 1977‚Äì78, after which he returned to Sicily and completed his football career with Ragusa in Serie C2 and Trapani in Serie D. At 28, he retired from football and settled in Capo d'Orlando, Messina, where he took up coaching artistic gymnastics. Initially he taught his daughters, but then opened a gym where other young girls could train, and the ASD Gymnasium Ginnastica Artistica expanded into a training centre \\"looking more like a theme park than a gym\\" with 150 girls of all ages.

Erected between 1927 and 1935, it was built to be the most secure and modern prison in Europe. Both criminal and political prisoners were sent there, as well as people imprisoned for preventive detention or for interrogation and prisoners of war. Built with a capacity of 1,800, it sometimes held over 4,000 during the Nazi era.  History  A first Zuchthaus in Brandenburg was established on Neuendorfer Stra√üe in 1820. The old Brandenburg Prison was closed in 1931 because of its disastrous hygienic conditions, but later housed a Nazi concentration camp from August 1933 till February 1934. It later became the site of the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre, part of the Nazis' involuntary euthanasia program known later as Aktion T4, where from February to October 1940, some 10,000 disabled, mentally retarded or mentally ill people were gassed based on official numbers.\\"Denkmal zur Befreiung des Zuchthauses Brandenburg-G√∂rden\\" City of Brandenburg, official website. Retrieved March 17, 2010 Upon the Nazi Machtergreifung, the new prison in G√∂rden became an instrument of political repression and terror. It was a Zuchthaus for inmates with lengthy or life sentences at hard labor, as well as prisoners who had been sentenced to death. Initially, there weren't many political prisoners at the new prison, but during the war years, the share increased to about 60%. In 1940, Brandenburg-G√∂rden became one of the selected central execution sites established throughout Germany by the order of Adolf Hitler and Reich Minister of Justice Franz G√ºrtner. An execution chamber was installed, using what had previously been a garage, with a guillotine and a gallows. The total number of executions was 2,743 and took place between 1 August 1940 and 20 April 1945, most of them convicts sentenced to death by Sondergerichte courts of the notorious People's Court under President Roland Freisler. The youngest victim was a 15-year-old French boy. By the end of 1942, \\"preventive detention\\" prisoners, such as Jews, Roma, Sinti, Russians and Ukrainians were sent to concentration camps.Dokumentationsstelle Zuchthaus Brandenburg Archive for Zuchthaus Brandenburg.

By the end of the Nazi era, from 1933‚Äì1945, roughly 4,300 people had been imprisoned at Brandenburg-G√∂rden. A total of 1,722 people, who were sentenced for political reasons, were executed there. 652 other political prisoners died from disease and seven committed suicide. The Red Army liberated the prison during the Battle of Berlin on 27 April 1945, finding around 3,600 prisoners, including 180 awaiting execution. After the war, the Soviet Army imprisoned collaborators here until 1947, primarily members of the Russian Liberation Army. Until 1989, the German Democratic Republic also used the correctional facility for political prisoners. Since 1975, there has been a memorial room at the prison, which is today part of a Justizvollzugsanstalt complex.  The present  Today the prison is divided into three main sections, plus a social therapy wing and prison hospital. There is a jail for 88 adults, a medium security wing for 330 adult men and a minimum security wing for 100 adult men. In addition, there is a social therapy wing with 80 men and a prison hospital with 32 beds. There are another 36 beds in the transport wing for prisoners who are being moved from one location to another. The JVA Brandenburg is a men's prison and is supported by a total staff of 439, of whom 145 are women. Prisoners there have sentences from temporary detention to life, the most severe sentence in Germany. Life sentence does not, however, mean one is to spend the rest of one's life in prison, rather that it is for an undetermined, but long time with a minimum of 15 years.

The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and conservatism, detailing the influences on him that led to his conversion. The book is partly intended as a response to God Is Not Great, a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007. Peter Hitchens, with particular reference to events which occurred in the Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media. Background In May 2009 The Rage Against God was anticipated by Michael Gove, who wrote in The Times: Hitchens first referred to The Rage Against God in August 2009, in one of his weekly columns: \\"Above all, I seek to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding of the nature of the USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument\\". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: \\"...it is obvious much of what I say [in The Rage Against God] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him [Christopher Hitchens], it would be absurd to pretend that much of what I say here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...\\". Synopsis=Part One: A Personal Journey Through Atheism The Last Judgement played a significant part in his conversion to Christianity. In Chapter 1, Hitchens describes abandoning religion in his youth, and promoting \\"cruel revolutionary rubbish\\" as a Trotskyist activist. He claims his generation had become intellectually aloof from religion, rebellious and disillusioned and in Chapter 2 explores further reasons for this disillusion, including the Suez Crisis and the Profumo affair. In Chapter 3, Hitchens recounts how he embraced scientific inquiry and adopted liberal positions on issues such as marriage, abortion, homosexuality, and patriotism. Chapter 4 is a lament for the \\"noble austerity\\" of his childhood in Britain. Chapter 5 explores what Hitchens views as the pseudo-religion surrounding Churchill and World War II heroes ‚Äì a \\"great cult of noble, patriotic death\\" whose only equivalent, he claims, was in the Soviet Union. Hitchens then asserts that, \\"The Christian Church has been powerfully damaged by letting itself be confused with love of country and the making of great wars\\". In Chapter 6, Hitchens recalls being a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union and a trip to Mogadishu, and how these experiences convinced him that, \\"his own civilisation was infinitely precious and utterly vulnerable\\". In Chapter 7, Hitchens charts his return to Christianity, and makes particular reference to the experience of seeing the Rogier van der Weyden painting The Last Judgement: \\"I gaped, my mouth actually hanging open. These people did not appear remote or from the ancient past; they were my own generation ... I had absolutely no doubt I was among the damned\\". In Chapter 8, Hitchens examines the diminishing of Christianity in Britain and its potential causes. Part Two: Addressing Atheism: Three Failed Arguments In the book Hitchens cites atrocities committed under the Khmer Rouge as an example of crimes against humanity perpetrated by atheist states (skulls of victims shown). In Chapter 9, Hitchens contends that the claim that religion is a source of conflict is a \\"cruel factual misunderstanding\\", and that a number of conflicts, including The Troubles and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, were not motivated by religion but tribal in nature and disputes over territory. Chapter 10 discusses whether morality can be determined without the concept of God. Hitchens asserts that atheists \\"have a fundamental inability to concede that to be effectively absolute, a moral code needs to be beyond human power to alter\\". He also describes as flawed his brother's assertion in God is Not Great that \\"the order to love thy neighbour 'as thyself' is too extreme and too strenuous to be obeyed\\". Hitchens ends the chapter by stating, \\"in all my experience in life, I have seldom seen a more powerful argument for the fallen nature of man, and his inability to achieve perfection, than those countries in which man sets himself up to replace God with the State\\". Hitchens begins Chapter 11 by asserting, \\"those who reject God's absolute authority, preferring their own, are far more ready to persecute than Christians have been ... Each revolutionary generation reliably repeats the savagery\\". He cites as examples the French revolutionary terror; the Bolshevik revolution; the Holodomor and the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33; the barbarity surrounding Joseph Stalin's five- year plans, repeated in the Great Leap Forward in China; atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge; and human rights abuses in Cuba under Fidel Castro. Hitchens then quotes a number of prominent communist thinkers' pronouncements on morality, including George Lukacs stating, \\"Communist ethics make it the highest duty to accept the necessity of acting wickedly. This is the greatest sacrifice the revolution asks from us\\", and Leon Trotsky's claiming that \\"morality, more than any other form of ideology, has a class character\\".The New International, Volume IV No. 6, June 1938, pp. 163‚Äì73. (New International was a magazine of Marxist theory published by the Socialist Workers Party of the United States between 1934 and 1940) Part Three: The League of the Militant Godless Demolition of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. In the book Hitchens details various attempts by the Bolshevik regime to expunge religion from Soviet society. Hitchens writes \\"the biggest fake miracle staged in human history was the claim that the Soviet Union was a new civilisation of equality, peace, love, truth, science and progress. Everyone knows that it was a prison, a slum, a return to primitive barbarism, a kingdom of lies where scientists and doctors feared offending the secret police, and that its elite were corrupt and lived in secret luxury\\". He then cites Walter Duranty's denying the existence of the great Ukrainian famine, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb's acceptance that the 1937 Moscow show trials were \\"genuine criminal prosecutions\\". Hitchens then examines Lenin's suppression of religion in the Soviet Union, which included making the teaching of religion to children punishable by the death penalty and the creation of an antireligious organisation of Soviet workers. Hitchens begins Chapter 13 by quoting William Henry Chamberlin: \\"In Russia, the world is witnessing the first effort to destroy completely any belief in supernatural interpretation of life\\", and then examines some consequences of this, including intolerance of religion, terror, and the persecution of priests and bishops at the Solovetsky concentration camp. Hitchens asserts that in the Soviet Union \\"the regime's institutional loathing for the teaching of religion, and its desire to eradicate it, survived every doctrinal detour and swerve\\". In the final chapter, Hitchens analyses a number of his brother's arguments, and contends that \\"the coincidence in instinct, taste, and thought between my brother and the Bolsheviks and their sympathisers is striking and undeniable\\". He then records how his brother nominated the \\"apostle of revolutionary terror\\" Leon Trotsky for an edition of the BBC radio series Great Lives; praised Trotsky for his \\"moral courage\\"; and declared that one of Lenin's great achievements was \\"to create a secular Russia\\". Hitchens speculates that his brother remained sympathetic towards Bolshevism and is still hostile towards the things it extirpated, including monarchy, tradition, and faith. He ends the chapter by claiming a form of militant secularism is becoming established in Britain, and that \\"The Rage Against God is loose\\". Epilogue In the epilogue, Hitchens describes how after a 2008 debate with his brother Christopher that \\"the longest quarrel of my life seemed to be unexpectedly over\\" and that he held no hope of converting his brother, who had \\"bricked himself up high in his atheist tower, with slits instead of windows from which to shoot arrows at the faithful\\". Critical reception After its UK publication in March 2010 the book received a number of mostly favourable reviews in British newspapers. In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse concentrated on the moral arguments in the book, and agreed with Hitchens that \\"to determine what is right and what is wrong without God, is difficult\\". Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book \\"tries to do two things at once. One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover\\". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, \\"One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing that so-called \\"religious\\" wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion.\\" In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, \\"Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently\\", but \\"makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism\\". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that \\"atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'\\". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, \\"Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that \\"it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God\\"; and that \\"atheist states are not actually atheist\\". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as \\"a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture\\". Reviews of the book in North American publications subsequent to its stateside release were more mixed. In The New York Times, Mark Oppenheimer commented, \\"American readers will notice a lack of enthusiasm in Peter's Christian apologetics. He proceeds largely from historical, rather than personal, evidence: here are the fruits of Christianity, and here is what one finds in its absence\\". In a negative review in the Winnipeg Free Press, Ted St. Godard wrote, \\"What Hitchens can't seem to appreciate is that, even if 'Soviet Communism is organically linked to atheism, something his brother and others argue against (if somewhat feebly), and even if one accepts that Soviet tyranny was horrible, this says little about the existence of God\\". In a Washington Times review entitled \\"Cain and Abel: The sequel?\\", Jeremy Lott wrote, \\"Hitchens refuses to make a full-throated case for faith. He explains that 'those who choose to argue in prose... are unlikely to be receptive to a case that is most effectively couched in poetry' ... Peter does hope that Christopher might one day arrive at some sort of acceptance that belief in God is not necessarily a character fault‚Äîand that religion does not poison everything\\". One mix of the two audiences is the British writer, Theodore Dalrymple, reviewing The Rage Against God and Christopher Hitchens' Hitch-22 for the American journal First Things. Dalrymple writes, Peter Hitchens \\"has discovered that it is he, and not just the world, that was and is imperfect and that therefore humility is a virtue, even if one does not always live up to it. The first sentence of his first chapter reads, ‚ÄúI set fire to my Bible on the playing fields of my Cambridge boarding school one bright, windy spring afternoon in 1967.‚Äù One senses the deep‚Äîand, in my view, healthy‚Äîfeeling of self-disgust with which he wrote this, for indeed it describes an act of wickedness. Peter‚Äôs memoir...is more personally searching.\\"[] Release details The book was first published in the UK on 15 March 2010 by Continuum Publishing Corporation, and was released in the US in June 2010 by Zondervan, with the additional subtitle How Atheism Led Me to Faith.

Additionally, there were two covers commissioned for issue 218: the solicited one by Greg Lauren showing John Constantine being crucified, and the published one by Lee Bermejo showing Constantine lighting a cigarette in the wind.

Dorofei took over the title of First Pet from Vladimir Putin's black labrador Koni, when Medvedev was inaugurated on 7 May 2008. Early life Dorofei was born in 2004. The Neva Masquerade breed comes from Saint Petersburg, however Dorofei was bred by the Great Hunter breeding company in Moscow. Svetlana Medvedeva bought Dorofei from the breeders as a kitten, and took him back to Saint Petersburg. Neva Masquerades with a good pedigree can cost up to twenty thousand Russian rubles. Noviye Izvestiya reported that Dorofei once got into a fight with a cat belonging to Mikhail Gorbachev, who was Medvedev's neighbour. Dorofei lost the fight, and was put onto antibiotics for a month to help heal the injuries he sustained in the fight, and was also castrated to prevent a repeat incident. It was reported by Reuters that in the lead up to Medvedev's inauguration, the Russian media shied away from investigating his history, so they focused on Dorofei instead. In Kremlin Russian media reported that Dorofei was a rather tough character, being independent and not following protocol. In June 2008, Russia issued a new non-currency banknote to delegates at the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg, featuring Dorofei on one side and a famous local cat on the other side. The banknote, named Tishka, issued on the International Day of St. Petersburg‚Äôs Cats. In November 2008, when Medvedev met with Taro Aso at the APEC meeting in Peru, Medvedev gave the Japanese Prime Minister a radio- controlled flying Doraemon toy for his son. It was reported at the same time that in Tokyo the idea of a cartoon film featuring the joint adventures of Doraemon and Dorofei were being discussed, in what the Japanese called an important step of rapprochement between Japan and Russia. In July 2009, the US president Barack Obama and his wife met with Dorofei in Gorki during their visit to Russia.

He is the fourth of six children, all male. During his childhood and teens, Budi and his family lived in a number of different cities in Java, including Yogyakarta, Bandung and Semarang, due to the nature of his father's position in the postal service. His schooling reflected his family's nomadic existence. Budi's attended elementary school in Kudus, junior high in Salatiga, and high school in Semarang, graduating from there in 1957. He then studied at the English Literature Department, Faculy of Letters, University of Gadjah Mada. After graduating in 1963, Budi moved to Iowa for the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. In 1970, he received a scholarship from the East-West Center to study humanities at the University of Hawaii, before graduating with an MA from Indiana University Bloomington in 1976. Four years later, in 1980, he earned his Ph.D for his dissertation on \\"Character and Moral Judgment in Jane Austen's Novels\\", from the same university. His return to Indonesia was followed by a succession of notable appointments: between the years 1984-1987 he was appointed Dean of the English Department of the State University of Surabaya (formerly IKIP Surabaya), became a member of the Arts Council, and Rector of the Surabaya Teachers' Training College. Budi Darma continued lecturing at the English Department of the State University of Surabaya until his retirement, at the age of 70, in 2007. In 1983 Budi wrote the novel, Olenka. It was his first work, inspired by a woman he met while studying at Bloomington. The title was taken from a collection of short stories by Anton Chekov. Although set in America, the novel remains steadfastly Indonesian in its use of Javanese wordplay to tell the story of an amorous plight of a young man with Olenka, the female heroine. Budi has explained his reasons for his choice of style as being due to his firm belief that a writer will never lose his or her roots, no matter how distanced from their place of birth. The novel was published by Balai Pustaka and went on to win several awards including the Jakarta Art Institute Literary award and the S.E.A.

He was best known in medical circles for having discovered the eponymously-named Arias- Stella reaction. Education Arias Stella's undergraduate studies were done first at the San Marcos National University's School of Science in Peru from 1942 to 1944 and then at the Faculty of Medicine from 1945 to 1951, from which he earned his bachelor's in 1951. His doctorate was also earned from that faculty in 1959. Research=Arias-Stella reaction Arias Stella found that a reaction previously thought of as a cancer in the endometrium was rather a normal reaction of hormones from placental tissue. It can also refer to changes occurring in the cervix. Altitude changes in anatomy and histology Later in his life, he became involved in researching how altitude changes in the Andes affected anatomy and histology in human beings, men specifically. It had long been thought that the multiple cases of pulmonary hypertension in Andes men came from the altitude they lived in. Arias Stella's research showed that \\"hypoxia-induced thickening of the pulmonary arteriolar walls\\" was the main cause for the hypertension. Considering that the natives had no access to vasodilators, their cases of hypertension were found to be different from known cases of acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Career=Early career Arias Stella began teaching as an instructor in pathology by 1949 in the same university and faculty that he already was attending. Over time he became a senior lecturer in clinical pathology. In 1961, he co-founded the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, where he began as an associate professor of pathology. By 1969, he was the principal professor and then head of the pathology department by 1975. He became the consulting professor for the National University of Caracas in 1974 and then the same for the Central University of Venezuela in 1975. He continued to have various professional standings in many hospitals in both South America and the United States. He also traveled as a visiting professor to many universities in the United States. He was asked to join multiple medical societies, including the American Association of Pathologists and the International Academy of Pathologists then went on to found the International Society of Gynecological Pathology, the Latin American Society of Pathology, and the Peruvian Society of Pathology. Political career Arias Stella was public health minister in 1963‚Äì65 and 1967‚Äì68 and became the foreign minister of Peru from 1980 to 1983 because of his involvement in the Belaunde regime. Arias Stella was the foreign minister during the Paquisha War in 1981 with Ecuador. During the early skirmishes over an outpost in Paquisha, he was quoted in newspapers as stating that Peru would proceed to recapture the rest of the territory that Ecuadorian forces were encroaching on. In 1984 and 1985, Arias Stella served as the President of the United Nations Security Council. Personal life He married Nancy Castillo Arias Stella and had four children.

He was also an actor, author, university lecturer, Plaid Cymru activist and founder of the American CADW (Committee to Aid the Defence of Wales). An expert on middle eastern affairs, and advisor to the United Nations and policy think-tanks, he was also interested in the arts, anthropology and science: his broadcasts included comment on the Irish theatre, European witchcraft, Congo tribal customs, chemical pesticides, the Abominable Snowman and Vernon Watkins. Biography Colin Edwards was born in 1924, the son of Brinley and Doris Edwards. His father worked in the meat trade, was a member of the Welsh Cob Society, a dog breeder, show judge, and an amateur historian. His mother had won a scholarship to the Sorbonne, but had not taken it up and had gone into teaching. She was a member of the Swansea Writers' Circle. After her second marriage she was known as Doris Williams; as Doris Seys Pryce she published poetry in the Welsh Review and other periodicals. Much of Colin Edwards' early life was spent at the Kingsbridge Inn, Gorseinon, near Swansea. After attending local schools, he went to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. During World War II in 1942 he joined the Fleet Air Arm. He flew as an observer on the Russian convoy route, was shot down over the Atlantic and later rescued. After the war Edwards studied at St Catherine's College, Oxford, but left within a year to take up journalism at the UN headquarters in New York. In 1949 Edwards became a combat correspondent with the British army in Malaya, and then covered the wars in Burma, Indochina and Korea. Over the next thirty years he broadcast radio documentaries from around the world, the majority on middle eastern affairs. He also produced commentaries on the wars in Biafra, northern Ireland and Vietnam. More than two hundred of Edwards' documentaries and in-depth interviews were made available for distribution to universities and schools by the University of California at Berkeley. On 14 January 1968, Edwards covered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s final visit to northern California for Pacifica Radio.Martin Luther King at Santa Rita 1968, Pacifica Radio Archives. From the 1970s Edwards virtually gave up radio reporting to concentrate on freelance lecturing and writing, including working with Yehudi Menuhin's father, Moshe, on his autobiography, The Menuhin Saga (published by Sidgwick and Jackson in 1982, and translated into four languages). Colin Edwards died on 11 July 1994, in Oakland, California, where he and his wife, Mary, had lived for some thirty years. His ashes were brought to Swansea, and are interred at Oystermouth cemetery. Colin Edwards was singer and broadcaster Cerys Matthews's cousin, known to her as Uncle Colin. Contribution to Dylan Thomas studies Colin Edwards used to return to Wales almost every year. In 1958 his cousin Mrs Tilly Roberts, who had been friendly with Dylan Thomas when they were teenagers, put him in touch with Thomas's mother, Florence. Mrs Thomas and Edwards talked about Dylan as a boy and young man and thought it important that someone should \\"bring out the Dylan known to his friends and relatives in Wales, the Dylan of the years of growing up and maturing; the 'real Dylan'...before what happened towards the end.\\" Florence suggested that Edwards should do the interviewing, and by 1968 he was able to write that \\"I have interviewed one hundred and twenty-two other relations, close friends and literary colleagues of Dylan during five extended visits home to Britain, three trips to Czechoslovakia and two to Italy.\\" By the mid- seventies, he had interviewed one hundred and fifty-one people, adding France, Switzerland and Iran to the list of countries visited. Based on these interviews Edwards wrote an unpublished biography of Dylan, the first chapters of which - on Thomas's boyhood, school and time with the Little Theatre - are in the National Library of Wales. Edwards also made three documentaries for the Canadian Broadcasting Company, called The Real Dylan, Dylan as a Youth and My Son Dylan. On his death, Edwards's interviews were donated to the National Library of Wales. They have since been transcribed, edited and published.Dylan Remembered, 2 vols. 2003 and 2004 by D N Thomas, Seren The Colin Edwards collection was digitised, catalogued and made available during 2020 as part of the Unlocking Our Sound Heritage project.

Methodology  Most usually, linguistic validation refers to a process whereby translated text is actively tested with patients in the target population and target language group through cognitive debriefing interviews. For example, if the PRO instrument is intended to measure the symptoms of diabetes in a trial in Denmark, the linguistic validation interviews would be conducted with diabetic patients in Denmark, who speak Danish as their mother tongue. This interview exercise ensures that items are appropriate for use in the target population, are clearly expressed and understood.Gawlicki, Mary C.; Handa, Melissa; McKown, Shawn Corporate Translations, Inc. \\"The Linguistic Validation of the Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL) Questionnaire\\" 2009 The exercise is also an important tool for demonstrating content validity when compared with the source. During the interview, the respondents complete the questionnaire, and then answer a series of open-ended questions on its content and explain what they think each item means in their own words. The results of this cognitive debriefing exercise should therefore show the respondents' understanding of the translation, and alterations can be made after this stage if nuances of meaning in the source text have not been clearly expressed in the translation and understood by the respondents. The process also ensures multi-lingual harmonization of the translations, by making sure that the questionnaire is understood in the same way by target populations across all language groups, thus ensuring that the resulting quantitative data can be compared across language groups. An alternative method of conducting linguistic validation is to ask a clinician who specialises in working with the target population to review the text, to ensure that it is clearly understandable. The clinician's understanding and knowledge of the usual terminology and phrases used by the patient group can be utilised, thus ensuring that the wording used in the translation reflects that which would be used by the target patient group themselves. Some parties feel that this step is sufficient to validate a PRO translation. However, regulatory authorities consider it preferable to validate measures through the above-mentioned cognitive debriefing with the patients in the target population where possible, and clinician reviews are more usually reserved for clinician-reported measures, or for particular circumstances in which testing with patients in the target population is particularly problematic (Wild et al. 2005). Some companies use the term 'linguistic validation' to refer to the entire process for the translation of PRO measures as described in the 'Principles of Good Practice' (Wild et al. 2005),Wild, Grove, Martin, Eremenco, McElroy, Verjee-Lorenz, Erikson, \\"Principles of Good Practice for the Translation and Cultural Adaptation Process for Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO)Measures: Report of the ISPOR Task Force for Translation and Cultural Adaptation\\" Value In Health Vol 8(2) 2005 and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Task Force report (Wild et al. 2009),Wild, Eremenco, Mear, Martin, Houchin, Gawlicki, Hareendran, Wiklund, Chong, von Maltzahn, Cohen, Molsen, Multinational Trials‚ÄîRecommendations on the Translations Required, Approaches to Using the Same Language in Different Countries, and the Approaches to Support Pooling the Data: The ISPOR Patient-Reported Outcomes Translation and Linguistic Validation Good Research Practices Task Force Report Value in Health Vol 12(4) 2009 even if this process does not include patient interviews or a clinician review. The recommended methodology utilises double, independently created translations into the target language, which are then combined into a 'reconciled version' which uses the best of both forward translations. The reconciled version, or harmonization, is then back translated (back translation) by two individual blinded translators who have no previous knowledge of the original questionnaire. The back translations are used as a window into the translated version, so that the project manager can assess whether the translated version accurately assesses the concepts measured by the source questionnaire. This stage is described as the back translation review. Ideally, it would be followed by patient interviews or a clinician review. Please note however, PROs should not be confused with PCOs, or patient-centered outcomes. PCOs implies the use of a questionnaire covering issues and concerns that are specific to a patient. A comprehensive linguistic validation process including cognitive debriefing is vital to demonstrate content validity in translations for use in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submission.

Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture or Old Croatian Art is Pre-Romanesque art and architecture of Croats from their arrival at Balkans till the end of the 11th century when begins the dominance of Romanesque style in art; that was the time of Croatian rulers (Croatian dukes and Croatian Kingdom). Historical background Celestin Medoviƒá, Arrival of Croats, before 1920, Croatian History Institute, Zagreb. Croats have moved from northern Europe, together with other Slavs and Avars, to the area of former Roman provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia and Istria, where they live til the present day. There they founded several principalities: Pannonian Croatia in the north around the river Sava, and Dalmatian Croatia along the western and southern Adriatic coast. Together they were known as White Croatia, while to the east there were medieval principalities in southern Dalmatia which were at times collectively called Red Croatia. Croats have been developed to the stage of Iron Age, and they didn‚Äôt know how to enjoy the riches of Roman cities, so they inhabited not the city itself but its suburbs (like the river island on the delta of river Jadro next to city of Salona). Croats have assimilated Avars, accepted Christianity, and the ruling cast learned to speak and write Latin.Art of Early Medieval Croatia at culturenet.hr Croats have accepted Christianity from Franks to the west and from Byzantium from the east. Most of the principalities have turned to Christianity in the 9th century except Pagania which was true to old Slav mythology until the 13th century. Croatian interlace with the inscription of duke Branimir‚Äôs name from year 880. First Croatian ruler that was recognized by the pope was duke Branimir, who was called by pope John VIII dux Chroatorum in his letter in 879. First king of Kingdom of Croatia, Tomislav from the House of Trpimiroviƒá was crowned around year 925 as rex Chroatorum and he united Pannonian Principality and Littoral Croatian Duchy into respectable medieval country which peaked during the reign of Petar Kre≈°imir IV (1058-1074). During the time of Croatian rulers the country was rarely ruled from one place and royal court would move from town to town in which there was a royal castle. The most important royal cities were Nin, Biograd na Moru and Knin. Other bigger cities were Zadar, Split, Krk, Osor, Trogir, Ston and Dubrovnik, in which big number of original Roman population resided that was eventually croaticized. After the death of last ruler from the dynasty of Trpimiroviƒá in 1091 most of Croatian nobility has accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as a king of unified kingdom of Croatian and Hungary, stated by the deal Pacta Conventa from year 1102. In Hungarian Kingdom, in Croatia all art already has all characteristics of Romanesque style. Architecture Church of St. Donatus from the 9th century in Zadar During 7th and 8th century in Croatia there is a trend of building smaller buildings from the material and decorative elements of ruined older Roman buildings. During the 9th century, parallel with the establishment of Croatian principalities, new architecture of pre-Romanesque characteristics emerged. It was based on numerous influences of which the Frankish and Byzantine were the strongest. Slowly these inherited influences were degrading in favour of original architectural forms. Church of Three Saints in Split (9th-11th century) From this time, there are dozens of large ones and over a hundred small churches preserved across entire Croatian coastline and islands. They are all built out of roughly broken stones covered with thick layer of moulter inside and out, and with narrow decorative niches with arched top (like church of st. Peter in Priko near Omi≈° and St. Michael near Ston). Also, they often have stone vaults, apses and domes, as well as stone furniture (frames of doors and windows, perforated stone windows, and altar fences) columns, beams and portals. Instead of classical Roman forms where every part of the building was articulated and had its own recognizable form, new pre-Romanesque buildings have those parts united in unified mass. Therefore, the point where the wall turns to vault, or to drum of the dome is almost unnoticeable. Even though they were built roughly with unsophisticated materials they have excellent and often perfect understanding of architectural space. Radovan Ivanƒçeviƒá from Culturenet.hr Smaller churches are called ‚Äúchurches of free shapes‚ÄùLjubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art (Hr) as which the medieval architects wanted to explore all possibilities of shaping on the circular and rectangular base. Cube churches with dome are a bit simple (St. Pelegrin, Dugi otok), rectangular with elliptical base are a bit more complex (St. George, Ravanjska), as well as single nave churches with dome above middle section (St. Peter in Omi≈°) and cube based churches elongated with two apses (Church of St. Donatus on Krk) and the most complicated ones are those based on Greek cross with dome on the centre and large apse in eastern wing and two smaller apses in northern and southern wing (Church of Saint Cross in Nin).Culturenet.hr Church of St. Dunat on the island of Krk. The most original churches are churches based on a circle with multiple apses that are spread around in radial rhythm. Church of St. Three in Split has radial 6 apses, while Church in O≈°lje (Ston) is the ony one with 8 apses. The biggest church with circular base is Church of St. Donatus in Zadar from the 9th century. Around its circular base that has a dome there is a ring nave with gallery and three apses on the east. From that time in central Europe there is only Charlemagne‚Äôs Palatine Chapel in Aachen that can be compared with its size and beauty. Large churches often have one or three naves, like St. Saviour, Cetina from the 9th century which has rounded buttresses and a bell tower above the western portal (westwork). In the 10th century Croatian queen Jelena of Zadar, the wife of king Mihajlo Kre≈°imir II, built in Solin two churches: Church of St. Stephen of the Island which was used as a royal mausoleum, and Church of Our Lady of the Island, one of the biggest in Croatia which was used as crown basilica. Church of St. Stephen was built in Carolingian style with entrance hall above which was a gallery surrounded with two towers (westwork) from each sides of a narthexIn its ruins was found famous sepulchral tablet of queen Jelena (‚Ä† 976) in which was stated that she was \\"widow of king Michael, mother of Stephan the king\\". http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 which led to tree nave church with two rows of pillars and a square apse at the end of central nave. In the 11th century, next to older ‚ÄúChurch on the Hill‚Äù in Solin, Crown church of St. Peter and Moses (better known as ‚ÄúHollow church‚Äú) was built. The church was of unified Croatian pre-Romanesque forms and those Romanesque that appeared with the arrival of Benedictine monks in these parts. It has three naves, many thin niches inside and three apses of which middle is square and other are semicircular from inside and square outside. In this church the legate of Pope Gregory VII has crowned Croatian Dmitar Zvonimir. In northern Croatia there are only few fragments of interlace found in Sisak, the capital of Ljudevit Posavski. When the bishopric was founded in Zagreb (1090), Croatian culture at the coast has already flourished for 300 years and Croatia was at the end of its independence. Sculpture Croatian interlace with inscription of king Stjepan Dr≈æislav from the 10th century.Ba≈°ka tablet, the most famous glagolitic monument written with transversal type of glagolitic script from the 11th century. Pre-Romanesque Croatian churches are also the most important historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and ciboriums we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Ri≈æinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke Trpimir (PRO DVCE TREPIMERO), from around year 850, while on the inscription of duke Branimir from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: CRVATORVM. On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes Muncimir of Croatia, Dr≈æislav and Svetislav, all the way to king Zvonimir from the end of the 11th century. That inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in Croatian language, written in Glagolitic script (Ba≈°ka tablet). Double literacy and two scripts have been noticed in several monuments as Plomin tablet (Istria) and Valun tablet (Cres, 11th century) where we have Latin language and script as well as Croatian translation in Glagolitic script. Nevertheless, soon the Latin script replaced the Glagolitic which was the only way that Croats would be accepted into still Romanized Medieval Europe. However, Croats will use their native language and script all the way to the 16th century, especially in Istria, Kvarner and on the Croatian coast. Baptistery with figure of Croatian king from the 11th century; now in the Split Cathedral.Plomin tablet Altar fences and stone perforated windows were decorated with shallow interlace ornament which we call Croatian interlace. Motifs of this interlace are often of classical origin (waves, three string interlace, pentagrams, nets of rhomboids, etc.), but while in the Roman art it was used only as a frame, here they cover the entire surface. Sheer number, but also the quality of stonework, of these monuments tells us of rich masonry tradition of numerous masters and workshops on the east coast of Adriatic. Comparing to thousands of fragments found in Dalmatia, in the northern Croatia there are only two confirmed founds: one in Lobor and one in Ilok.Radovan Ivanƒçeviƒá, Umjetnost razdoblja ≈æivot I., Profil, Zagreb, 2001, pg. 190. Sometimes the interlace is replaced with figures of Gospels (like on the altar fence of Holy Sunday Church in Zadar), but those figures are flatten and their character lines are reduced to graphic lines in outmost linear stylization. The same is the relief from Crown Hollow church of king Zvonimir in Solin with the figure of (Croatian) king on the throne with Frankish crown, beside him is a page, and on the ground is a bowing subject. This relief is from the 15th century a front part of a baptistery in Split Cathedral. In church of St. Mary from the 11th century in Bishopric (Biskupija) near Knin the oldest figure of Holy Mary in Croatia was found.Josip Soldo: History of Church in Croatia, Zagreb-Frankfurt/M., 1976. Painting Croatian interlace was originally painted, usually every string would be coloured brightly yellow, red or blue. Since the wall paintings that are mentioned in several literal sources (like the portraits of Trpimiroviƒá dynasty in church of St. George in Putalj above Ka≈°tel Suƒáurac) are not preserved, they are only type of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting. Significant number of church codices were preserved. They were done on pergam with pre-Romanesque miniatures of high quality and technique. The oldest one is Split Breviary that was written and painted from the 8th to 11th centuries, based on famous Breviaries from pre- Carolingian era. In Zagreb there is a Liber psalmorum which was illuminated in Benedictine style by prior Majon for archbishop Paul of Split (c. 1015‚Äì1030). In Vatican there is a Breviary, also in monte-cassino Benedictine style (initials of intertwined leaves, interlace and animal heads) which originates from monastery of St. Nicola in Osor. The same style of illumination we can found in Breviars in Trogir, ≈†ibenik and Dubrovnik but there are many that were recorded (like 47 books in only one church in monastery of St. Peter in Seka) but not preserved.

Biography  Born to an era that saw the birth of radio, television and modern communications, Joshua Sieger, the founder of the gas detection brand J&S; Sieger (known today as Honeywell Analytics), was not only the father of modern gas detection but a pioneer of diverse communications technologies. He impacted on a variety of industries, helping to catalyse technological advancement in a number of fields including television, radar and gas detection.I was there - An Autobiography, by Joshua Sieger, published by the Poole Historical Trust, 2003  Childhood inspiration  Born on 5 January 1907 in Shepherd's Bush, London, England. Over the next few years, Sieger focused academically on science and engineering, supplementing his studies with trips to a large library situated near to the Latymer Foundation School he was attending in Hammersmith, London.  Wireless  When he was 10 years old, Sieger obtained a copy of a publication called Wireless World, which featured an advertisement for a supplier of glass tubes, iron filings, germanium and silicon crystals‚Äîthe raw constituents of a coherer. This type of device is sensitive to high-frequency currents, consisting of a glass tube, filled with iron filings and a contact at each end of the glass tube. High-frequency currents would make the iron filings adhere and therefore conduct electricity. Sieger made a number of these sets and sold some back to the supplier he had bought the components from in order to buy more parts. By the age of 13 Sieger had erected an aerial on his parents' house. The young boy waited tentatively for a signal, and received his first Morse Code transmission from Gibraltar on the device in 1920.  First innovation  Sieger's first notable innovation was the development of a single triode circuit for a three-valve radio set in 1923. His inspiration for the device came from an avant-garde belief that portable radios would be the future. To create such a device would require a lightweight system and an evolution of the current setup. His new invention featured enhanced clarity and was so impressive that one customer even offered to provide the money needed to obtain a patent for the device and manufacturing funds‚Äîon the condition that he could have his name in the application and share the sales. Towards the end of 1924, the 17-year-old Sieger had not only turned his bedroom into a laboratory of sorts for his portable radio project, but also planned to wire up local houses with devices so he could rent music to them. This activity coincided with him completing his studies, and Sieger took on a position working for Amateur Wireless, a popular radio enthusiasts' magazine. In his new role, he would work closely with the technical editor, producing two wireless devices per week and explaining their construction. In 1925, whilst working for the magazine, a patent for his innovative new portable radio was officially applied for and a company, Portadyne Radio, was formed to sell the set called the Olympus. Sieger had to apply for a license to sell radios, and obtained this from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), making him a founding licensee of this organisation. The work required by Amateur Wireless was very time-consuming, prompting Sieger to move away from becoming a manufacturer. In his autobiography, I Was There, Sieger talks of this decision and the impact it may potentially have had. \\"My work was so time consuming that I gave up the idea of being a manufacturer, although it was possible that this could have been one of the very first portable sets in the World\\".  Optical technology and impact in radar  In 1930 Sieger made the transition into another emerging communication medium: the use of optical technology to create visual platforms and projectors. He joined an organisation called Scophony, developing projection-based television systems. The outbreak of World War II halted development of the projection systems at Scophony, and the employees in their laboratories were seconded into developing secret signalling systems based on television techniques. Sieger moved to the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Worth Matravers in Dorset on the south coast of England and applied his optical knowledge to assist the AMRE (Air Ministry Research Establishment), in its development of technology capable of detecting German planes. It was during this period that Sieger was instrumental in the development of radar technology. In fact, the history of radar cites the two years research work conducted at Worth Matravers as the most valuable in radar development. During this time, Sieger applied his optical knowledge to design large-screen displays of radar signals, using an ultrasonic light cell and cylindrical lenses. These components were arranged in such a way to create a triangulation on the screen to pinpoint a target, and the principle was well received and used to successfully detect German bombers.  Consultancy  In the years following the war, Sieger worked in both the UK and US as a consultant for a number of companies in various industries. But upon returning to the UK in 1956, Sieger realised that his time would be better spent focusing on developing his own ideas and innovations, and selling them to companies with manufacturing capabilities. During his time on the south coast working on radar, Sieger had developed an interest in boating and had acquired a number of friends with yachts and vessels. It was this interest that would catalyse the next chapter in his life story. After introducing an Australian naval architect to a friend who had a 45-foot yacht requiring some modifications, a conversation arose around the lack of a reliable and sensitive gas detector designed for use on small boats. In fact there had been a number of fires and explosions on board small boats, because the detectors on the market were not reliable and were not always able to detect a leak if one occurred. The absence of such a device in the marketplace interested Sieger greatly and he decided to make the design of a suitable gas detection device his first consultancy project on his own behalf. Developing gas detection  After conducting some research into market potential for such a device, Sieger set about developing a new product. At the time, most gas detection seemed to be focused towards mining applications. It was decided that such a product should feature remote sensor mounting capabilities (so the sensing element could be placed in the most suitable area), with a supporting controller situated somewhere else for easy access. It would need to run on a low power supply and it would also need to be selective to flammable gas only, with no cross interference from factors such as humidity or temperature. During the early part of 1957, Sieger set up test rigs to fully evaluate the sensitivity of his new catalytic bead driven device. After 12 months of intensive testing, sufficient facts were available to apply for a patent for the device. It had always been Sieger's intention to disengage from this project once a designed model was finalised and ready for manufacture. After meeting with the Managing Director of a boat manufacturer in Portsmouth called Vosper Ltd, six initial devices were built. By the end of 1958 some notable interest and publicity had been generated for the new device, after a unit fitted on board a vessel moored in Poole successfully alarmed, detecting a dangerous leak. In total 100 boats based in Poole Harbour featured the new device, with many more expressing an interest in buying one. Fate stepped in once more for Joshua Sieger, when Vosper Ltd decided to halt their entry into the gas detection market, choosing to concentrate on building motor torpedo boats instead of the new device. Although it caused a setback for Sieger, it also allowed him the opportunity to look at the complicated design Vosper Ltd used, with a view to making a less expensive device that was more commercially viable.  Incorporation of IEC-Sieger  After refining the device in partnership with a new manufacturer, International Engineering Concessionaires (IEC), the new and improved device, called Mark 9, was ready to be marketed. On 31 July 1959, IEC-Sieger Ltd. was incorporated. IEC-Sieger Ltd would position itself as a global player very early on; it was decided from the outset that the new company would focus primarily on export markets rather than domestic opportunities, and local distributors were set up in major countries, using IEC's infrastructure. The success of Mark 9 was impressive, and the device's superior sensitivity impressed its purchasers, so much so that a senior director from Unilever, who had purchased a device for his own boat, asked whether a variant could be made to detect ammonia. This catalysed the company's transition into more sophisticated markets and industries that required Intrinsically Safe (IS) devices, with the release of Mark 7; a modified variant of Mark 9 designed to meet Unilever's specific requirements. By June 1961, a decision was made to manufacture in-house, and a new building was purchased in Poole, Dorset. IEC still carried out the sales and marketing of the products initially, but as the months passed, Sieger decided that the products being produced required more technical, engineering-based selling techniques to maximise market potential. With this in mind, Sieger informed IEC of his wish to undertake product sales and marketing in-house and disengaged from IEC after a deal was finally struck. A new company called J&S; Sieger was established towards the end of 1961. The Mark 9 marine unit, which had catalysed the emergence of what would later become one of the world's premier gas detection providers, was in fact the first in a long line of ground-breaking product innovations.

The development of dockyards on both sides of the river around the Isle of Dogs indicated that a river crossing of some kind was needed. A tunnel from Rotherhithe to Limehouse was suggested in about 1803 in which the NothumbrianSkempton, 'A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineering in Great Britain and Ireland, 2002, entry Vazie, Robert https://books.google.com/books?id=jeOMfpYMOtYC&pg;=PA737&lpg;=PA737&dq;=robert+vazie&source;=bl&ots;=aD8uUX2d1c&sig;=1hePUEeLs- LXVrYw4ie8KgS5H08&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=OFQkVMasOMS_ygPusIKQCw&ved;=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q;=robert%20vazie&f;=false engineer Robert Vazie became involved. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 12 July 1805 which enabled the Thames Archway Company to start construction. The idea was to bore a pilot tunnel or 'driftway' starting from a shaft to be sunk in Rotherhithe (i.e. from the south bank). The driftway was supposed to drain the surrounding bedrock and then be enlarged into a full, brick-arched tunnel which would accommodate two-way vehicular traffic. Unfortunately the firm strata anticipated were mostly sand and gravel with pockets of quicksand. After a year Vazie had only driven a shaft deep and money was running out.'EPCK', Engineering Timelines Social Network, Thames Driftway http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1187 In 1807 the directors of the company brought in Richard Trevithick who agreed to take the driftway across the river for a success fee of ¬£1,000. Employing Cornish miners to dig and a 30-horsepower steam engine to pump, he eventually succeeded in making the driftway from the Rotherhithe shaft: he had tunnelled under the Thames, albeit only beyond the low-water mark. This was the first time that anyone had made a tunnel pass underneath the actual water of any river. However, it remained to complete the excavation under the high-water mark, and this Trevithick was unable to do, owing to breakthroughs of quicksand.Richard Trevithick Jr, 'Life of Richard Trevithick, with an Account of His Inventions', vol 1, 249-284 The failure of the Thames Archway project led engineers to conclude that \\"an underground tunnel is impracticable\\".Nathan Aaseng, Construction: Building the Impossible, p. 28.

She also excelled in steer riding, bulldogging, and automobile jumping. In her riding career, McCarroll competed against such other women as Tad Lucas, Mabel Strickland, Fox Hastings, Dorothy Morrell (Robbins) and Florence Hughes. Early life McCarroll was born on a cattle ranch at High Valley, near Boise, Idaho, in 1897. In her early career, she won two cowgirl bronc riding championships at both Cheyenne Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the first rodeo hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In 1915, her first year of rodeo competition, McCarroll attracted national attention from a photograph taken of her being thrown from the horse named \\"Silver\\" at the Pendleton Round-Up. In her career, she performed before kings, queens, such dignitaries as U.S. President Calvin Coolidge, while he was vacationing in the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1927, and before countless rodeo fans worldwide. After her death, rodeo officials instituted safety regulations and eliminated bronc riding as a women's sport. Pendleton Round-Up  Bonnie McCarroll thrown from \\"Silver\\" at the September 1915 Pendleton Round-Up, photo by Walter S. Bowman The Pendleton Round-Up of September 1929 was to have been McCarroll's final competition, for she had planned to retire with her husband, Frank Leo McCarroll (September 5, 1892-March 8, 1954), a bulldogging performer, to their home in Boise. While giving a bronc riding exhibition, she was suddenly thrown from her mount, \\"Black Cat\\". The animal turned a somersault upon her. She was rushed to a hospital but died later of her spinal wounds and pneumonia.  Frank McCarroll Frank McCarroll (1919) Frank McCarroll was born on a farm in Morris, Minnesota. He left home at thirteen, having drifted to North Dakota, Montana, and Idaho, where he became a boxer and wrestler. He also took a business course in Butte, Montana. In 1911, while in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he wrestled his first steer and won a $1 bet. Soon in rodeo competition, he broke the world record for bulldogging in Boise in 1913, at which time he met the 16-year-old \\"Bonnie\\" Treadwell. Frank McCarroll won championships in steer wrestling at Pendleton twice, Chicago three times, Cheyenne once, Detroit once, St. Louis once, Fort Worth twice, and three times at Madison Square Garden. After Bonnie's death, he became involved as a stuntman and uncredited actor in such films as The Man from Hell and Romance Revier. He died at the age of sixty-one from an accidental fall at his home in Burbank, California. Frank referred to Bonnie, who weighed from 95 to 112 pounds, as \\"the best little cook in the world and some dressmaker, too.\\" Legacy In 2002, Bonnie McCarroll was posthumously inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Ann Ayres made a sculpture of McCarroll's 1915 horse-throwing accident at Pendleton. Many have mistaken her 1915 fall, photographed by Walter S.

She was the dedicatee of piano works by a number of famous composers. Early years Therese Jansen is believed to have been born in Aachen in Germany some time around 1770.New Grove, cited below Her father was a successful dancing master, who moved to London with his family.New Grove The family business of teaching dance to well-off customers was quite successful and was continued for some time by Therese and her younger brother Louis Jansen (1774‚Äì1840).Strunk (1934, 194) According to an anonymous biography of Jansen's daughter (see below), the business made over 2000 pounds per year.Strunk (1934, 194) Both Therese and Louis studied with the famous pianist Muzio Clementi.New Grove Therese particularly excelled, and by her young adulthood, she had become an outstanding performer. By 1791 she probably had a strong reputation, as Johann Peter Salomon gave her and her family free tickets to the first series of the famous concerts which Joseph Haydn gave in London under his auspices.This is known from the diary of Charlotte Papendieck; see Robbins Landon (1976, 52) Career Not long after, works were being dedicated to her by composers: Clementi, Haydn, and J. L. Dussek (see below).New Grove She was listed by a contemporary encyclopedist as one of Clementi's three most distinguished pupils, along with John Field and Johann Baptist Cramer.Strunk (1934, 194) Little evidence survives to document her career as a performer. Salwey mentions a performance of a Haydn sonata before the Anacreontic Society prior to 1791 and two other performances in 1806.Salwey (2004, 280) It is possible that Jansen's fame developed primarily from performances in private homes.The New Grove, contradicting Salwey, states that \\"Therese is not known to have played in public.\\" Therese Jansen was married on 16 May 1795 to Gaetano Bartolozzi (1757-1821), a son of the noted artist and engraver Francesco Bartolozzi.New Grove One of the witnesses at the ceremony was their friend Haydn.New Grove Gaetano Bartolozzi was primarily an art dealer who also branched out into the sale of other goods as well; his work often took him to Venice.Strunk (1934) Bartolozzi was successful in his business and had purchased an estate about fifty miles from Venice.Strunk (1934, 196) Like Therese, he was musical and was a fine violinist and violist.Robbins Landon (1976, 441) Following two miscarriages,Strunk (1934) Therese gave birth to a daughter Elizabetta Lucia, who grew up to be a famous actress and theatre manager, performing under her married name of Lucia Elizabeth Vestris, or Madame Vestris. Therese and Gaetano also had a second daughter Josephine.New Grove In 1798, Bartolozzi closed up his art business, auctioning off his stock at Christie's, and the family left for Europe: first Paris, then Vienna, and finally Venice.

It is believed that the cult was created by rice farmers in need of land and water, and at its peak was extremely popular.Ngoc, 976. The cult was mostly suppressed during the Communist Party of Vietnam's early reign, as worship was considered to be Taoist in nature, and was a tool of oppression.Taylor 2003, 4.Taylor 2004, 38&42.

Whitmore - Essays Into Vietnamese Pasts 1995- Page 47 \\"As she could not erase from her mind the memory of her passage on earth, she was allowed by the Emperor of Jade to return to the earthly world with the title of Princess Lieu-Hanh. Thereupon, she went down again to earth in the company of ...\\" In V√¢n C√°t Th·∫ßn N·ªØ truy·ªán Born as the thirteenth daughter of the Jade Emperor, Li·ªÖu H·∫°nh had always been the troublemaker of the family. A righteous man, Le Thai Cong, was knocked unconscious during his wife's pregnancy. While unconscious, Thai Cong arrived at the Heavenly Palace of the Jade Emperor and witnessed Lieu Hanh drop the emperor's favorite jade cup, for which the Emperor expelled Li·ªÖu H·∫°nh from heaven. When Thai Cong regained consciousness his wife had given birth to a girl, whom they named \\"Giang Tien\\"(Descending Fairy NGUY·ªÑN, 81.). After living a righteous life of 23 yearsSimon, 140. and giving birth to two children, Giang Tien died on the third day of the third month. When Giang Tien died she ascended to Heaven and was granted the title of Princess Li·ªÖu H·∫°nh, and was permitted to return to earth on the second anniversary of her death. On her return she visited her family and told her husband that they would reunite again, and disappeared leaving nothing behind but clouds in the sky. She wandered the world as either an old woman or a beautiful lady playing the flute, punishing those who teased her and blessing those who gave her offerings. Long after her family died, she visited a temple and met Phung Khac Khoan, a famous scholar, who attempted to compliment the princess. However she had disappeared before he had the chance, leaving a stick inscribed with her name. Years later Phung, who was now a high-ranking official, visited a tavern in West Lake which was owned by Lieu Hanh. After poetry and discussion, Phung left the tavern, but when he returned it had mysteriously disappeared. Leaving West Lake, the princess went to Ngh·ªá An where she met a young orphan student named Sinh whom she thought to be an incarnation of her husband. After leaving poetry for him, Sinh sought her out and confessed his love to her. They married and had a child, Sinh becoming a great scholar. Eventually it was time for Lieu Hanh to return to Heaven, and she sadly left her family to return to Heaven. On her second return to Heaven the princess again pleaded with the Emperor to return to earth, and this time returned with two other fairies ‚Äî Que and Thi. The princess blessed those who were good, and brought destruction on those who were not, so the people built a temple out of fear. The C·∫£nh Tr·ªã government heard she was an evil spirit and sent the military to burn down the temple. When her temple was burnt down, all the animals in the area died from a mysterious disease, so the villagers built a platform to send her offerings. The princess appeared on the platform, declaring she was from Heaven, and demanded that the government build a new temple for her to stop the epidemic. The government built the new temple in Pho Cat Mountain, and proclaimed her \\"Ma Hoang Cong Chua\\" (Golden Princess to Whom Sacrifices Are Made as to the God of War).Dror, 85-89.

The next to appear was the Tien Huong temple some time between 1643 and 1649, which would come to be the main center for Lieu Hanh's cult. Temples to Lieu Hanh are known to have many wooden sculptures, and the temples themselves have intricate designs carved into the framework.Ngoc, 201. Historical existence Whether or not Li·ªÖu H·∫°nh was a historical person is a subject of debate, as accounts for her life are difficult to match to a proper timeline. The earliest written account for her existence was in the 1880s by A. Landes, a French colonialist.Dror, 48. He places her appearance at sometime between 1428-1433. However the vast majority of stories claim her birth to be at the year 1557,Dror, 53. including ƒêo√†n Th·ªã ƒêi·ªÉm.

It was built by Germany next to the town of Illange in the early 20th century after the annexation of the Moselle following the Franco-Prussian War. The Fort d'Illange was part of the Moselstellung, a group of eleven fortresses surrounding Thionville and Metz to guard against the possibility of a French attack aimed at regaining Alsace and Lorraine, with construction taking place between 1905 and 1911. The fortification system incorporated new principles of defensive construction to deal with advances in artillery. Later forts, such as Illange, embodied innovative design concepts such as dispersal and concealment. These later forts were designed to support offensive operations, as an anchor for a pivoting move by German forces into France. The Feste Illangen, as Fort d'Illange was called by the Germans, with Fort de Guentrange and Fort de Koenigsmacker, assured the protection of Thionville against French attack. Positioned to the rear of the principal lines of combat in the First World War, the fort never saw combat in that war, but was captured by advancing American forces in the Lorraine Campaign of World War II. Description The Fort d'Illange is located about to the south of Thionville on a hilltop overlooking the Moselle. It was defended by a garrison of 1200 men. Like the Fort de Koenigsmacker, Illange features an armoured battery, originally armed with four short 100mm guns in single turrets. Four separate fortified barracks housed troop, with underground galleries connected the battery, barracks, and infantry positions. The dispersed, un-walled nature of the later Moselstellung was a significant innovation. Compared to the French S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system forts of the same era, later German fortifications such as Illange were scattered over a large area and enclosed chiefly by barbed wire. While certain individual elements presented imposing walls to an attacker, these walls were not continuous. The dispersed nature is evidenced by the official French name: the Groupe Fortifi√© d'Illange (Fortified Group of Illange). These arrangements were studied and improved upon by the French in the construction of the Maginot Line. Illange's fairly compact arrangement includes four dispersed fortified barracks built into a hillside so that their rears are shielded by earth, while the tops and fronts are protected by three of four metres of concrete, and are surmounted by parapets. The single battery is similarly constructed and linked to the barracks by tunnels at an average depth of 8 to 11 metres, about in length. The four 100mm guns in the battery were protected by Schumann turrets and controlled by two armored observation cupolas on top of the north and south barracks. The east and west barracks are also equipped with cupolas. The whole was surrounded by deep networks of barbed wire, which were swept by fire from small perimeter blockhouses, also linked via the tunnel system. The interior of the position was equipped with trenches for infantry. The barracks and batteries were further armoured with reinforced concrete and armored windows. A variety of blockhouses and infantry shelters were also built in the intervals between forts. The barracks and armored batteries featured central heating, while electricity was provided from a central utility plant equipped with five 45 hp diesel engines. Operational concept From 1899, the Germans viewed Metz as a secure position that could provide an anchor for a pivoting movement into France from the Low Countries. This strategy, which would become known as the Schlieffen Plan, required that the Moselstellung deter an advance by French forces into Lorraine while the German forces mobilized. History In 1905, Illange was completed in 1911 and saw no action during World War I, as Thionville remained well within German lines for the duration of the war. Feste Lillangen was the headquarters for the Thionville group of fortifications, under Generalleutnant von Lochow. With the Compi√®gne armistice of 1918, Lorraine was returned to France and the fort became French property. The three Thionville forts became known as the Fortified Group of Thionville. :See Fortified Sector of Thionville for a broader discussion of the Thionville sector of the Maginot Line. The Fort d'Illange was integrated into the Fortified Sector of Thionville of the Maginot Line in the 1930s, serving as the sector's command post and backing up the newer Maginot ouvrages that were built about halfway between Thionville and the border with Luxembourg. The short 105mm guns were replaced by 105mm long guns removed from the German fortifications of Metz. The artillery range was thus increased from to . During the Battle of France the Thionville area was bypassed and encircled by German forces, with the Maginot and earlier fortifications seeing little action. In 1944, as the Fort de Koenigsmacker was being subdued to the north, the U.S. 95th Infantry Division approached Illange on 11 November 1944.

History Subtitled \\"A Weekly Show of Political, Social and Literary Wares\\", it was founded by Thomas Gibson Bowles, who aimed to expose the contemporary vanities of Victorian society. The first issue appeared in London on 7 November 1868. It offered its readership articles on fashion, current events, the theatre, books, social events and the latest scandals, together with serial fiction, word games and other trivia. Bowles wrote much of the magazine himself under various pseudonyms, such as \\"Jehu Junior\\", but contributors included Lewis Carroll, Arthur Hervey, Willie Wilde, P. G. Wodehouse, Jessie Pope and Bertram Fletcher Robinson (who was editor from June 1904 to October 1906). Thomas Allinson bought the magazine in 1911 from Frank Harris, by which time it was failing financially. He failed to revive it and the final issue of Vanity Fair appeared on 5 February 1914, after which it was merged into Hearth and Home. Caricatures A full-page, colour lithograph of a contemporary celebrity or dignitary appeared in most issues, and it is for these caricatures that Vanity Fair is best known then and today. Subjects included artists, athletes, royalty, statesmen, scientists, authors, actors, soldiers, religious personalities, business people and scholars. More than two thousand of these images appeared, and they are considered the chief cultural legacy of the magazine, forming a pictorial record of the period. They were produced by an international group of artists, including Max Beerbohm, Sir Leslie Ward (who signed his work \\"Spy\\" and \\"Drawl\\"), the Italians Carlo Pellegrini (\\"Singe\\" and \\"Ape\\"), Melchiorre Delfico (\\"Delfico\\"), Liborio Prosperi (\\"Lib\\"), the Florentine artist and critic Adriano Cecioni, the French artists James Tissot (\\"Co√Ød√©\\"), Prosper d'√âpinay (\\"Nemo\\") and the American Thomas Nast.

Manegold was president of the Milwaukee-Waukesha Brewing Company, with plant at No. 155 South Water Street in Milwaukee, was born September 15, 1851, in the city which is still his home. His father, Charles Manegold, was a native of Braunschweig, Germany, and came to the United States in 1848. For a time he resided in Cincinnati, Ohio, and then removed to Milwaukee. He was a blacksmith by trade but in later life turned his attention to the ice business in this city and in 1868 built a flour mill on South Water street, which he continued to own and operate until his death in May 1879, his son Charles Jr., being associated with him in this undertaking. He was an active and progressive businessman and he enjoyed the respect and confidence of all. His father was Henry Manegold, who was likewise a blacksmith by trade. The mother of Charles Manegold Jr. bore the maiden name of Wilhelmina Notbohm, and she too was born in Braunschweig, Germany, while her death occurred in Milwaukee in 1909. Our subject has two brothers, Henry and William, who are yet regents of Milwaukee, the former now living retired. Two other brothers, Fred and Albert Manegold are deceased. Education and early career Manegold obtained a public school education in his native city, after which he learned the miller's trade in his father's mill, serving an apprenticeship to Eugene Hotchkiss, who had rented the mill. He thoroughly mastered the business in principle and detail and in 1871 was admitted to a partnership under the firm style of Hotchkiss & Manegold. Later in the same year, however, the firm went out of business. Manegold afterward operated the mill for his father and an uncle, August Manegold, for a period of three years. At the end of that time August Manegold died and Charles Manegold Jr. became an equal partner with his father in the business. He remained an active factor in the conduct of the enterprise until 1910. Mid-career In 1876, he had become a partner of Charles James Kershaw in the ownership of the Northwestern Marine elevator, and in 1878 he and his father purchased the Reliance Flour Mill at West Water street. He took an active part in the successful management and control of all three of these business enterprises and was actively associated with the milling business until 1910. In the meantime, he had become interested in the Milwaukee Malting Company in 1886 and was identified therewith until 1898, when the company sold out to the American Malting Company. Milwaukee Waukesha Brewing In 1899, Manegold became the owner of the business carried on under the name of the Milwaukee-Waukesha Brewing Company, of which he was the president. It has breweries in downtown Waukesha, Wisconsin, and nearby at Fox Head Springs, a business has been developed to substantial proportions and in its conduct Manegold displayed the same spirit of enterprise, determination and progressiveness which characterized him in his other industrial and commercial connections. Family life On 16 October 1875, Manegold was married to Miss Anna Kretschmar, a daughter of Robert Kretschmar, a native of Saxony, Germany, who conducted business as a butcher and meatpacker. The Manegolds had three daughters: Emily, who married A. S. Lindeman, of Milwaukee; Ella, the wife of Frank Boesel, a lawyer of the city; and Irma, who married Dr. Edwin Henes. of New York. Emily had two daughters, Alice and Charlotte, while Ella had three children, Charles, Frank and Marianna, and Irma had two children, Virginia and Edwin. Community service Manegold took a deep and helpful interest in public affairs. He was one of the first Milwaukee Park commissioners of the city, filling the office in 1889 when the park system was inaugurated. He gave much time to the project for a period of ten years and as a member of the first park board, he made the original purchase of what is now Lake Park, Washington Park, Kosciuszko Park and other parks of the city. His co-operation could at all times be counted upon to further any plans or measures for the general good. Politically, he maintained an independent course and never held or desired elective office. Social organizations He was identified with many social organizations and societies which had to do directly with the benefit and upbuilding of Milwaukee. He had membership in the Association of Commerce, the Milwaukee Athletic Club, the Wisconsin Club, the Calumet Club, the Blue Mound Country Club and also in the Milwaukee Art Institute. He greatly enjoyed bowling and fishing and turned to these for recreation when leisure permits. Travel He also benefited greatly by travel abroad and visited Spitsbergen, Egypt, the Holy Land, South America and other points of wide interest. He went to Alaska in 1898, the year gold was discovered there, but he did not learn of the discovery until he had returned to Seattle. He also visited the West Indies, saw the Panama Canal in the making and traveled throughout Mexico. He was always accompanied by his wife or other members of the family and he found his greatest happiness in promoting the welfare and happiness of the members of his own household. As a member of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce he served for twenty years as one of the committee on arbitration. He closely studied the questions which were vital to the welfare and progress of the city and state in which he made his home, and his support of any measure was an indication of his firm belief in its value as related to good government.

Annual assemblies gathering the representatives of several French-Canadian associations occurred around that time, but these involved no more than 30 people. In May 1963, MLA Jean-Jacques Bertrand presented a motion in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in which he asked for the setting up of \\"a special committee to prepare the convocation of the French-Canadian General Estates\\". However, this move was not followed and the initiative of convening the Estates General came from civil society instead of the Quebec Parliament. In April 1964, the proposal of the FSSJBQ regarding the Estates General was endorsed by various associations and intermediary bodies of Quebec's civil society.F√©d√©ration des Jeunes Chambres, F√©d√©ration des Commissions scolaires, F√©d√©rations des Coll√®ges classiques, F√©d√©ration des travailleurs du Qu√©bec, Conf√©d√©ration des syndicats nationaux, Union catholique des cultivateurs, Conseil de la vie fran√ßaise, Association d'√©ducation du Qu√©bec, Corporation des instituteurs et institutrices du Qu√©bec, Association canadienne des √©ducateurs de langue fran√ßaise, Conseil d'expansion √©conomique, etc.EGCF.

This is used as the memorial site. STEVEN MAYER, April 19: A day of solemn remembrance, The Bakersfield Californian, Thursday, Apr 19, 2007., from bakersfield.com, accessed September 22, 2015. However this site does not meet the required ten mile distance up river from Keyesville mentioned by the report, being only six miles from that ghost town following the Keyesville Road to the river and following the right bank up river according to the topographic map of the area. The ten mile distance brings the location to the west bank of the Kern above Lake Isabella just below Kernville near the present location of the Kern Valley Golf Course. This seems a likely site for a village, with water and wood, level ground along the river with its resources, and is about ten miles from Keysville, upon the right bank of Kern River.

Parker, the eighth in his Jesse Stone series. It was the last in the series to be published before his death in 2010. Plot summary Night and Day begins with the investigation of a middle school principal accused of molestation. Several girls accuse Principal Betsy Ingersoll of making them pull their dresses up so she can see their panties. The principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. She also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. She sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. Although there is no crime to charge her with, Jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls‚Äô civil rights were violated. He begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. Later one of the girls comes to see Jesse at his office. She tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. She and her little brother hate it and she asks Jesse if he can help. With swinging not illegal, Jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. He has Suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. Suit discovers that the girl‚Äôs mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. Jesse has Spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. The main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the Night Hawk. The Night Hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the Paradise police get several calls about him. Later the Night Hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. He then begins writing Jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. He writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret.‚Äù He also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. Jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the Night Hawk. Since the Night Hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. The women in the club all identify Seth Ralston. Ralston is a professor of English at a nearby university. He is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. Jesse discovers that Ralston's wife used to teach a Wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. He also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that Ralston‚Äôs wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full- time. Jesse questions Ralston‚Äôs wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the Night Hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the Night Hawk. She responds by belittling Jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. Meanwhile, Jesse continues to pressure Betsy Ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the Night Hawk. Soon after Jesse receives a nude photo of Betsy, however he and Molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. The local media request an interview concerning the attack, and Jesse uncharacteristically agrees. He gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the Night Hawk who demands that he never attacked Betsy Ingersoll. Jesse believes that the Night Hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. Jesse confronts Betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. She says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. She was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. Jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see Sunny Randall‚Äôs shrink, Dr. Silverman (the long-term love interest of another Parker character Spenser), which she does. A few days later Seth Ralston‚Äôs wife comes to Jesse to report that her husband is missing. They begin searching for him, and soon after Jesse receives another letter from the Night Hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. He writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman‚Äôs secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to Jesse. Jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be Betsy Ingersoll, but Jesse believes he is actually targeting Molly. They set a police unit in front of Betsy‚Äôs house as a decoy, but then stake out Molly‚Äôs house. Molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so Jesse can hear her. The Night Hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. Suit and Jesse then break in to arrest him. Surprised that they figured out he was after Molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but Molly, Suit, and Jesse all shoot and kill Seth Ralston, putting an end to the Night Hawk. Suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed Ralston, but since all three fired, Jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing Suit that it could have been any one of the three.Parker, Robert B. (2009). Night and Day. New York, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. Subplots The main subplot involves the further deterioration of Jesse‚Äôs relationship with Jenn. Jenn takes a job on a syndicated news program in New York, and moves in with the producer in Manhattan. Jesse takes the news hard and begins drinking heavily again. He finally comes to the realization that Jenn only uses him when she needs him. Jesse begins seeing Sunny Randall again. Sunny is single again as Richie returned to his wife after their son was born. Realizing that Richie will never leave his son, Sunny finally believes the relationship is over. The novel ends with Sunny at Jesse‚Äôs apartment having drinks when Jenn calls. She gets up to leave, but Jesse asks her to stay as he wants her to hear the conversation. Jenn tells Jesse that her show was canceled, and she broke up with the producer. She asks if she can move back in with Jesse and tells him that she needs him. He tells her no and hangs up. Jesse and Sunny toast each other as the novel ends.

The lyrics basically deal with a typical teen story of a first love and how one imagines it will last forever. At some point it all collapses and it feels that the world is breaking. The result is a \\"tragedy\\" and tears. The song is very energetic and has a fast tempo. It is also melodic, even though the guitar parts are a punk style. \\"Tragedy\\" was recorded at Park Studios outside Stockholm at the Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks recordings. \\"Caf√© Avenue\\" talks about Hanoi Rocks's individualist-attitude and how it doesn't matter how you look and who you are. The song also features a story told from the point of view of a character who lives a rough, young and wild life, but eventually has to turn to prostitution to earn money. The story is largely inspired by Hanoi Rocks's own life on the streets of Stockholm, where people thought the band were homosexual prostitutes because of their glam rock-look. This song was also recorded at Park Studios outside Stockholm at the Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks recordings. \\"Caf√© Avenue\\" wasn't released on an album until 1982's Self Destruction Blues. On the Japanese single, the song \\"Don't Never Leave Me\\" was used as the B-side. The song was later reworked in to a hit-version titled \\"Don't You Ever Leave Me\\", which is featured on the album Two Steps from the Move.

As Corsica Joe he teamed up with Jean Louis Roy, who was billed as \\"Corsica Jean\\" to form a very successful tag team known as \\"The Corsicans\\". The Corsicans held a number of tag team championships, especially in the southern National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territories of NWA Mid-America, Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Florida and Georgia Championship Wrestling. He was the brother of Felix Miquet who was also a wrestler, but worked primarily in the United Kingdom. He was married to female pro wrestler Sarah Lee, sometimes billed as \\"Sara Corsica\\". Professional wrestling career Miquet moved to the United States at some point before 1947 and made his professional wrestling debut in 1947, using his real name as his ring name. In 1948 he defeated Bob Lortie to win the Canadian Junior Heavyweight Championship, a championship he was said to have held for two years. Miquet spent most of 1953 wrestling in Germany where he used the name Billy Virag, possibly to avoid confusion with his brother Felix Miquet that was known in the wrestling circuits throughout Europe. In 1954 he worked as the masked ring character \\"Mr. M\\" in Germany before returning to the United States in mid-1954, once again billed under his birth name. After competing in the north eastern United States and Canada for several years Miquet began wrestling in the south east around 1957. In Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling he became known as \\"Corsica Joe\\", billing his as hailing from the French island of Corsica. A few months later wrestling promoters Nick Gulas and Roy Welch in the NWA Mid-America promotion teamed Miquet up with French-Canadian Jean Louis Roy, billing him as \\"Corsica Jean\\" to form a tag team known as \\"The Corsicans\\". The team became the first holders of the Mid-America version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship and over the next two of years the Corsicans held the championship on no less than seven occasions as well as the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship on three separate occasions. The Corsicans faced off against virtually every tag team in the NWA Mid-America promotion at the time, including The Fabulous Fargos (Jackie Fargo and Don Fargo), Mike and Doc Gallagher, Yvon Robert and Billy Wicks, Don and Luke Fields and The Heavenly Bodies (Don and Al Greene). In mid-1959 the Corsicans toured Texas, working for the Dallas, Texas based Southwest Sports, Inc.. In Texas the duo won the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship on one occasion as well as the local version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Miquet, as Corsica Joe also held the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship for a few weeks. By 1960 the Corsicans were back in the south west, holding different versions of the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship, including the Gulf Coast version twice, the Florida version once, the Georgia version twice, and the Mid-America version again. They also captured the Mid-America version of the World Tag Team Championship and Georgia Championship Wrestling's NWA International Tag Team Championship. After years as a tag team the Corsicans finally split up in 1966, leaving Miquet to team with Chin Lee for one last run with the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship. In 1969 he briefly worked for Central States Wrestling as the masked Mephisto #2, and would work as the masked \\"The Blitzer\\" for NWA Mid-America in 1972. Miquet retired from wrestling in 1973 at the age of 52 or 53. Although retired in 1973, Joe did make appearances for the NWA World Wide area, with Bert Prentice being the promoter. Joe did team up with his wife in a match, in Nashville, against Clarence Santini (as Spunkmeyer) and Shorty Taylor. this was Joe's last match. Personal life Francois Miquet was the brother of Felix Miquet who was also a wrestler, but who worked primarily in the United Kingdom so the two never worked together. Miquet was married to a female pro wrestler named Sarah Lee, sometimes billed as \\"Sara Corsica\\" or \\"Mrs. Corsica Joe\\", and they were together as husband and wife for almost 45 years of marriage until she died at the age of 76 in 2008. Miquet died on March 14, 2010 in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 90.

Early life Penzo was born in Chioggia, Venice, in Veneto; he is one of seven siblings. His father was a fisherman. When he was seven, Penzo moved to Baranzate with his family. After leaving school at the age of 14, he began working as a carpenter, and then as a mechanic at his brother in-law's auto-repair shop; he initially played football with his friends and for several local teams, before pursuing a professional career in football. Career A Varese youth product, Penzo began his footballing career at the age of 19, in Serie D, with Borgosesia in 1972, before moving to another Serie D side, Romulea for a season in 1973, where he made a name for himself as a promising striker, due to his eye for goal. In 1974, he was acquired by Roma, as a striker-partner for Pierino Prati; he struggled to gain playing time with the capital club, however, and only made 19 appearances during the 1974‚Äì75 season, scoring just one goal, which came in an away win over Fiorentina. In 1975, Penzo was transferred to newly promoted Serie B side Piacenza in a co-ownsership deal. He struggled to fit into manager Giovan Battista Fabbri's system, however, and after three months, having failed to score and having made only two appearances as a substitute for the club, he was transferred to Serie C side Benevento, where he scored 12 league goals in 27 appearances during the 1975‚Äì76 season. The following season, he moved to Serie C side Bari, helping the club obtain promotion to Serie B with his prolific goalscoring, totalling 27 goals across his two seasons in Serie C. After another season in Serie B with Monza, he was sold to Brescia in 1979, helping the club achieve promotion to Serie A with 12 goals; the following season however, he struggled to find the back of the net, scoring only 4 times in 27 appearances, as Brescia suffered relegation at the end of the season. Penzo joined Serie B side Verona in 1981; under manager Osvaldo Bagnoli, he became a key player for the club, and scored 14 goals in 31 appearances during the 1981‚Äì82 season, helping Verona obtain promotion to Serie A. His best individual season was in the 1982‚Äì83 season, when, playing as a lone striker, he scored 15 league goals with Verona to become the second- best scorer of the season in the Serie A, alongside Alessandro Altobelli, and behind only Michel Platini, who scored one more, and won the Capocannoniere title with 16 goals. Penzo also helped Verona reach the Coppa Italia final, scoring 7 times in 13 appearances, including the decisive goal against Milan in the quarter-finals, and a goal in Verona's 2‚Äì0 home win in the first leg of the final against Juventus; however, Verona lost out on aggregate following a 3‚Äì0 defeat in extra-time in the second leg. Penzo's performances prompted the Turin club, for whom Platini coincidentally played, to purchase him from Verona the following season at the age of 30, in exchange for the co-ownership of Giuseppe Galderisi and Massimo Storgato; Penzo was initially intended to be a replacement for the recently departed Roberto Bettega, who had left Juventus to play football in Canada. Penzo immediately won the Serie A title, in what was to be his only season with the club, as his performances did not convince the Juventus management to renew his contract. Although he gelled well with his strike partner Paolo Rossi, his spell with Juventus was less successful than his time at Verona from an individual standpoint, however, as he was less consistent and was ultimately unable to replicate his goalscoring form from the previous season with the Turin side, only managing 5 league goals in 25 appearances, and often starting from the bench. Despite his struggles in front of goal in the league throughout the season, he starred for the club in the 1983‚Äì84 European Cup Winners' Cup, as Juventus also went on to win the competition that season; during the tournament, he achieved a rare feat of scoring 4 goals in the same game, which he managed in a 7‚Äì0 first round home win against Lechia Gda≈Ñsk on 14 September 1983. In total, he scored 10 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions for Juventus. Penzo spent the next season with Napoli, where he initially played alongside Diego Maradona, although following the arrival of Bruno Giordano, he struggled both to score and break into the starting line-up, and ended his professional career at the end of the season in 1986. After being ruled out of the Napoli first team the following season, he joined Serie C1 side Trento for the 1987‚Äì88 season, and officially retired from football in 1988. In total, Penzo played 6 seasons (122 games, 27 goals) in the Italian Serie A, and made 136 appearances in Serie B, scoring 44 goals. After retirement Following his retirement, Penzo returned to live in Verona, where he worked as a sporting goods representative. He later also worked as a football pundit and commentator for local television stations in Verona. Style of play A tall, powerful, and physically strong centre-forward, with an eye for goal, Penzo excelled in the air, courtesy of his height and heading accuracy; due to his good technique, he was also known for his ability to make runs with the ball at speed and strike the ball powerfully on the run. An intelligent and hard-working forward, although he was capable of playing as a lone striker, he was also known for his ability to play off of other forwards, and usually performed at his best alongside a faster and more opportunistic striker, such as his Verona strike-partner Mauro Gibellini, and his Juventus strike-partner Paolo Rossi. Although he was regarded as a promising prospect in his youth, he was at times inconsistent at the top level in his later career.

The agency provides emergency shelter and meals, supportive housing, education, and vocational training, and specialized services for homeless families, seniors, and adults with disabilities. Beneficiary population 71% of ECS's 7,000 clients are currently or formerly homeless. 20% are African American, 21% Caucasian, 10% Latino, 30% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1% Native American, and 18% of mixed or other ethnicity. Over 60% of ECS clients live with disabilities, chronic illness, substance abuse disorders, cognitive impairments or other medical or behavioral health challenges. Emergency shelter Founded in 1983, Episcopal Community Services of San Francisco (ECS) operates two year-round shelters for homeless adult women and men in San Francisco. Along with hot meals, showers, laundry facilities, and clean, warm beds, ECS's The Sanctuary and Next Door shelters offer on-site health services, support groups, recreational activities, and access to programs to assist them in moving toward housing and increased stability. ECS also collaborates with The San Francisco Interfaith Council to provide 80-100 nightly shelter beds and meals from November to March. Coordinating with the Department of Public Health, ECS staffs an 11-person roving behavioral health team that serves residents with the most acute need in five San Francisco shelters. The staff includes mental health specialists, bilingual case managers, and substance abuse counselors. The shelters also partner with San Francisco State University School of Nursing to provide additional on-site health services. Supportive housing ECS provides supportive housing to over more than 1,300 formerly homeless men, women, and children. The eleven sites offer on-site support services such as case management, health education, employment counseling, food pantries, after school care, and community activities because the majority of tenants suffer from mental or health disabilities, HIV/AIDS, substance use issues, and literacy and/or vocational barriers.

It appears in the Udyoga Parva (book), and is composed of five chapters (AdyƒÅya 41‚Äì46).Buitenen (1978) identifies it as chapters 42‚Äì46, whereas M√ºller (p. 135, footnote 1) identifies it as chapters 41‚Äì46. One reason for the SƒÅnatsujƒÅtiya's importance is that it was commented upon by Adi Shankara,Johannes Buitenen (1978). The MahƒÅbhƒÅrata (vol. 3). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. the preeminent expositor of Advaita Vedanta, and one of the most important Hindu sages, philosophers, and mystics. Buitenen wrote that \\"The SƒÅnatsujƒÅtiya had a minor reputation as a philosophical classic.... The text certainly deserves more study than it has received\\" (p. 182). He also wrote that > The SƒÅnatsujƒÅtiya should probably be best approached as a brief, late- > upani·π£adic text that very early attracted to itself, by way of appendix, > commentary, and continuation, other texts that were considered to be of the > same inspiration....

It ends with a mystical hymn on the > manifestations of the Supreme... with the refrain: \\"The yogins behold the > sempiternal blessed Lord.\\" (p. 182) Synopsis of SƒÅnatsujƒÅtiya King Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra has been conversing with his half-brother Vidura, who has been responding to his requests for various kinds of counsel. :Ch. 41: King Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra asks for more information. Vidura replies that he, as born from a Shudra woman, must not speak of secret matters relating to Atman but one who has taken birth as a Brahmin, if he states these secret matters, is not censured by the devatas. Therefore these matters may be spoken by the eternal sage SanatsujƒÅta. Vidura then invokes SanatsujƒÅta by meditating on him. When SanatsujƒÅta appears, Vidura requests that he dispel Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra's doubts. :Ch. 42: Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra asks SanatsujƒÅta why he teaches that death does not exist. SanatsujƒÅta replies that distraction equals death, and elaborates. :Ch. 43: SanatsujƒÅta continues, explaining that Veda (scriptures) cannot save someone from evil, but can lead to better rebirth. There are many scriptures, but one truth, on which one should meditate, which gives knowledge of brahman. :Ch. 44: SanatsujƒÅta continues, explaining the need for brahmacarya (self-restrained behaviour) and a guru (spiritual teacher). :Ch. 45: SanatsujƒÅta describes the state of the yogin (realised person) in hymn-like language. A continuing refrain is \\"The yogins behold the sempiternal blessed Lord\\" (p. 292). Other affirmations in this chapter include \\"No one beholds him with his eye, but they who with wisdom, mind and heart gain knowledge of him have become immortal\\" (p. 292), and \\"If one sees oneself in all creatures yoked to their various tasks, why should he worry any more?\\" (p. 294), and ::\\"My soul is the place, my soul is the birth, ::I'm the ageless foundation the Vedas declare\\" :::(p. 294) Editions *Johannes Buitenen's (1978) translation of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata contains a summary (p. 285) and translation (pp. 285‚Äì294) of the SƒÅnatsujƒÅtiya (partly available online via Google book preview) *Kashinath Trimbak Telang (1882) translated the SƒÅnatsujƒÅtiya (freely/fully available online ‚Äì see External links), which appeared in volume 8 of the Sacred Books of the East series edited by Max M√ºller.

He was also a farmer in Otago, and his extended family included a number of political figures. Early life Humphreys was born in 1841 in Montgomeryshire, Wales. He was the second son of Erskine Humphrey, a barrister at law of Lincoln's Inn. He received his education at Harrow School, a boarding school in north- west London in the town of Harrow. He emigrated to New Zealand and settled in the Strath Taieri district for farming. He purchased several areas of land (Six Mile, Garthmyl and Gladbrook), which were part of runs 213 and 213A. He married Alice Humphreys (n√©e Hawdon), the second daughter of Hon. Joseph Hawdon MLC on 22 April 1869 at St John the Baptist Church in Christchurch. He thus became brother in law with Robert Campbell, who had married Hawdon's eldest daughter, Emma Josephine, on 2 December 1868 in Christchurch. Humphreys was also first cousin with Frederic Jones, who represented the Heathcote electorate from 1887 to 1890. Political involvement After having let his property, Humphreys retired to Christchurch in 1888. Although he was a squatter (i.e., a significant pastoral land holder), he had 'decidedly liberal' beliefs, and one of his best friends used to jokingly taunt him with being a 'beastly radical'. Member of Parliament The resignation of Sir Julius Vogel caused the 19 June 1889 by-election in the Christchurch North electorate, contested by three candidates. Humphreys, John Ollivier and Eden George received 403, 378 and 184 votes, respectively. Ollivier had prior political experience, representing Christchurch Country in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. Prior to that, he was the 2nd chairman of the Christchurch Town Council, a role that became that of Mayor of Christchurch a few years later. For Humphreys, who was relatively new to Christchurch, to beat such a well known person with political experience showed how well regarded he had become in a short period of time. The electorates in Christchurch were reorganised for the 5 December 1890 general election. Christchurch North was abolished, and City of Christchurch was set up as a three-member electorate. Humphreys decided to contest this electorate, and the six contenders received the following votes: William Pember Reeves (2774 ‚Äì elected), Westby Perceval (2721 ‚Äì elected), Richard Molesworth Taylor (2613 ‚Äì elected), J. Tippett Smith (1811), Humphreys (1668) and Eden George (119). Member of Christchurch City Council Charles Gray was elected as Mayor of Christchurch a few days prior to the general election, and his seat in the North-West ward of the Christchurch City Council became vacant. Humphreys declared his candidacy for the city council ward on 10 December. Whilst Humphreys and W. I. Ballinger were nominated on 15 December for the 30 December election, Ballinger withdrew and Humphreys took his seat at the 23 December 1890 council meeting. He retained his seat on the city council until he left for England in September 1891. Return to England Humphreys returned to England as he had cancer, and he was given the advice that better specialist medical knowledge was available in his old country. A leaving party was organised for him by the Cambrian Society on 1 September 1891, which had a large attendance. Humphreys died from cancer in London in April 1892. The Humphreys had no children. He was survived by his wife, who married again in England in 1896.

Timbuwarra figures are generally made of rattan and painted, and may serve several functions, although they are generally held to be associated with fertility rites and with the spirit world.Timbuwarra at about NSW Few are known to exist, and their purpose is generally poorly understood. Timbuwarra are flat, woven, and anthropomorphic. Usually they are made of rattan and painted with ochre pigments in earth tones;Timbuwarra at the Tomkins CollectionTimbuwarra Figures they may also be further decorated with cassowary feathers and beads. They may sometimes also take the form of animals.\\"Phantom Shields\\" from Artnet The figures are created by elders during times of disaster, such as disease, earthquake, or famine. The uses of the timbuwarra are varied; they are most often seen as guardian figures outside of ceremonial houses, which are constructed at some distance from the village. They would sometimes be used in mourning rituals, and have been described as representations of dead women to which respects may be paid by friends and relatives; the status of the women and their manner of death is not known. Sometimes, timbuwarra would also be used during male initiation rites to teach boys about sexual behavior. One collector has recorded: > One of these that I had had two holes down in the abdomen area ‚Äì one above > the other. I was told that this was used to teach the young men which hole > to aim for during sex to avoid pregnancy.Michael Hamson, quoted at the > Tomkins Collection website They were also sometimes carried or worn by village men during fertility rites; when worn, they were often attached to a ceremonial wig in a fashion known locally as \\"female pinned by a penis to the wig\\". Once timbuwarra have outlived their purpose, they are buried to refertilize the earth from which they were formed. A small number, however, have found their way into Western collections in more recent years; an example exists in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, while others are held privately. The practice of making them died out with the coming of Catholic missionaries in the 1950s, and few are made today.San Saeng No.20 Autumn/Winter 2007 Leaving Together Helping Each Other References Category:Papua New Guinean culture Category:Southern Highlands Province ","title":"Timbuwarra"},{"id":"26578975","text":"Nyasaye (also Nyasae or Nasaye) is the Luo and Gusii word for God. The same or similar words are also used by speakers of Luhya languages, but they refer to the same entity. for the Luo people, Nyasaye means the creator of the beginning, The Luo also called Nyasaye with different names such us Obongo NyaKalaga,Obong'o means one of a kind, while NyaKaldaga means the all powerful everlasting one.Luos are strictly monotheistic. Some researchers have argued that the word Nyasaye doesn't mean exactly the same how comes thing for the Luo people as the word God does in English as a supreme high power, and even if the Luo people understand the concept, it doesn't necessarily carry the same connotations. The fact that English language is used to study religion in this case doesn't help to understand the way that these African populations apprehend the notion of God. However, some of the expressions in Luo languages which are used as prayers to speak about God/Nyasaye are direct translations from the Bible, and they don't have any other equivalents in their language. For the Luhya people, the high god is called Wele or Were, and he is male- gendered, while other spirits and gods can be of both genders or not gendered. The Christian God, Nyasaye, is also considered to be male. Altered states of consciousness (ASCS) and Nyasaye Theologist Jim Harries affirms that the way that African people get in touch with Nyasaye is through altered states of consciousness, which are seen as completely natural. ASCS can cause people in Kenya to dance violently or to see visions. They also believe that worldly wealth and understanding of the world can also be achieved by contacting Nyasaye through these states.

The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. After the hoax was discovered and corrected in September of that year, the then-78-year-old Seigenthaler, a friend and aide to Robert Kennedy, wrote in USA Today that the article was \\"Internet character assassination\\". The incident raised questions about the reliability of Wikipedia and other websites with user-generated content that lack the legal accountability of traditional newspapers and published materials.\\"The State of the News Media 2006 .\\" The Project for Excellence in Journalism. Retrieved on September 14, 2009. In a December 13 interview, co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for Wikipedia policy allowing articles to be edited by unregistered users, describing the participation of editors in China and Iran in terms of privacy issues, but announced plans to roll back their article creation privileges as part of a vandalism-control strategy.  Hoax  The author of the hoax article was later identified as Brian Chase, an operations manager of Rush Delivery, a delivery service company in Nashville, Tennessee. On May 26, 2005, Chase created a biographical article about John Seigenthaler that contained, in its entirety, the following text: > John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy > in the early 1960s. For a short time, he was thought to have been directly > involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John, and his brother, Bobby. > Nothing was ever proven. John Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in > 1972, and returned to the United States in 1984. He started one of the > country's largest public relations firms shortly thereafter.  Detection and correction  In September, Victor S. Johnson, Jr., a friend of Seigenthaler's, discovered the article. After Johnson alerted him to the article, Seigenthaler emailed his friends and colleagues about it. On September 23, 2005, colleague Eric Newton copied Seigenthaler's official biography from the Freedom Forum web site into Wikipedia. The following day, this biography was removed by a Wikipedia editor due to copyright violation and was replaced with a short original biography.Archived version of the rewriting of the official biography. Newton informed Seigenthaler of his action when he ran into Seigenthaler in November in New York at the Committee to Protect Journalists dinner. In October 2005, Seigenthaler contacted the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, Jimmy Wales, who hid affected versions of the article history from public view in the Wikipedia version logs, in effect removing them from all but Wikipedia administrators' view.Two deletion log entries of the article. Some mirror websites not controlled by Wikipedia continued to display the older and inaccurate article for several weeks until the new version of the article was propagated to these other websites. In 2013, the hoax article was archived to . Anonymous editor identified On November 29, 2005, Seigenthaler described the incident in an op-ed in USA Today, of which he had been the founding editorial director. In the article, he included a verbatim reposting of the false statements and called Wikipedia a \\"flawed and irresponsible research tool.\\" An expanded version was published several days later in The Tennessean, a daily newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, where Seigenthaler had served in various capacities from beat reporter to chairman. In the article, Seigenthaler detailed his own failed attempts to identify the anonymous person who posted the inaccurate biography. He reported that he had asked the poster's Internet service provider, BellSouth, to identify its user from the user's IP address. BellSouth refused to identify the user without a court order, suggesting that Seigenthaler file a John Doe lawsuit against the user, which Seigenthaler declined to do. Daniel Brandt, a San Antonio activist who had started the anti-Wikipedia site \\"Wikipedia Watch\\" in response to objections he had to his eponymous article, looked up the IP address in Seigenthaler's article, and found that it related to \\"Rush Delivery\\", a company in Nashville. He contacted Seigenthaler and the media, and posted this information on his website. On December 9, Brian Chase admitted that he had posted the false biography because he believed Wikipedia to be \\"some sort of joke web site.\\" After confessing, Chase was fired from his job at Rush Delivery. He presented a letter of apology to Seigenthaler, who successfully interceded with Rush Delivery to reinstate Chase. Seigenthaler confirmed, as he had previously stated, that he would not file a lawsuit in relation to the incident. He commented, \\"I'm glad this aspect of it is over.\\" He stated that he was concerned that \\"every biography on Wikipedia is going to be hit by this stuff‚Äîthink what they'd do to Tom DeLay and Hillary Clinton, to mention two. My fear is that we're going to get government regulation of the Internet as a result.\\"  Reactions = Seigenthaler's public reaction  In his November 29, 2005 USA Today editorial, Seigenthaler criticized Congress for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects ISPs and web sites from being held legally responsible for content posted by their customers and users: On December 5, 2005, Seigenthaler and Wales appeared jointly on CNN to discuss the matter. On December 6, 2005, the two were interviewed on National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation radio program. Wales described a new policy that he had implemented in order to prevent unregistered users from creating new articles on the English-language Wikipedia, though their ability to edit existing articles was retained. In the CNN interview, Seigenthaler also raised the spectre of increased government regulation of the Web: In the December 6 joint NPR interview, Seigenthaler said that he did not want to have anything to do with Wikipedia because he disapproved of its basic assumptions. In an article Seigenthaler wrote for USA Today in late 2005, he said, \\"I am interested in letting many people know that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool.\\" He also pointed out that the false information had been online for over four months before he was aware of it, and that he had not been able to edit the article to correct it. After speaking with Wikipedia co-founder, Jimmy Wales, Seigenthaler said: \\"My 'biography' was posted May 26. On May 29, one of Wales' volunteers 'edited' it only by correcting the misspelling of the word 'early.' For four months, Wikipedia depicted me as a suspected assassin before I erased it from the website's history Oct. 5. The falsehoods remained on Answers.com and Reference.com for three more weeks.\\" Editing Wikipedia, he suggested, would lend it his sanction or approval, and he stated his belief that editing the article was not enough and instead he wanted to expose \\"incurable flaws\\" in the Wikipedia process and ethos. On December 9, Seigenthaler appeared on C-SPAN's Washington Journal with Brian Lamb hosting. He said he was concerned that other pranksters would try to spoof members of Congress or other powerful figures in government, which may then prompt a backlash and turn back First Amendment rights on the Web. In the June 2007 issue of Reason magazine, Seigenthaler also expressed concern about the lack of transparency underlined by Wales' removal of the hoax pages from the article's history page. He has also stated that many of the comments left by users in the edit summaries are things he would not want his nine-year-old grandson to see.  Wikimedia Foundation reaction  In an interview with BusinessWeek on December 13, 2005, Wales discussed the reasons the hoax had gone undetected and steps being taken to address them. He stated that one problem was that Wikipedia's use had grown faster than its self-monitoring system could comfortably handle, and that therefore new page creation would be restricted to account-holders, addressing one of Seigenthaler's main criticisms. He also gave his opinion that encyclopedias as a whole (whether print or online) were not usually appropriate for primary sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative (as some were doing), but that nonetheless Wikipedia was more reliable as \\"background reading\\" on subjects than most online sources. He stated that Wikipedia was a \\"work in progress\\". A variety of changes were also made to Wikipedia's software and working practices, to address some of the issues arising. A new policy, , was created on December 17, 2005; editorial restrictions, including reference requirements, were introduced on the creation of new Wikipedia articles; and new tracking categories for the biographies of living people were implemented.Restricted editing Wikipedia Signpost December 2005 The Foundation added a new level of \\"oversight\\" features to the MediaWiki software, accessible as of May 16, 2012, to around 37 experienced editors and Wikimedia staff members nominated by either Wales or the Arbitration Committee. This originally allowed for specific historical versions to be hidden from everyone (including Oversight editors), which then become unable to be viewed by anyone except developers via manual intervention, though the feature was later changed so that other Oversighters could view these revisions to monitor the tool's use. Currently such procedures are standardized by the 'Office actions' policy which states: \\"Sometimes the Wikimedia Foundation has to delete, protect or blank a page without going through the normal site/community process(es). These edits are temporary measures to prevent legal trouble or personal harm and should not be undone by any user.\\"  Other reactions  In reaction to the controversy, The New York Times business editor Larry Ingrassia sent out a memo to his entire staff commenting on the reliability of Wikipedia and writing, \\"We shouldn't be using it to check any information that goes into the newspaper.\\" Several other publications commented on the incident, often criticizing Wikipedia and its open editing model as unreliable, citing the Seigenthaler incident as evidence. The scientific journal Nature conducted a study comparing the accuracy of Wikipedia and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in 42 hard sciences related articles in December 2005. The Wikipedia articles studied were found to contain four serious errors and 162 factual errors, omissions or misleading statements, while the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica also contained four serious errors and 123 factual errors, omissions or misleading statements. Referring to the Seigenthaler incident and several other controversies, the authors wrote that the study \\"suggests that such high-profile examples are the exception rather than the rule.\\"  See also  * Bertrand Meyer ¬ß Wikipedia hoax  References = Notes  Other sources    , interview with John Seigenthaler and Jimmy Wales. * * , Talk of the Nation story summary and radio broadcast.

Milan, and U.S. Foggia, making 99 appearances, and scoring 25 goals in total during his time in the Italian top division. During his time with Napoli, he wore the number 11 shirt; under manager Luis Vinicio, Napoli were known for their exciting style of play and came close to winning the league title during the 1974‚Äì75 season, in which Braglia scored 12 goals. Braglia won the 1975‚Äì76 Coppa Italia with the club, scoring a goal in the victorious final; in total he made 80 appearances for Napoli during his three seasons with the team, scoring 24 goals. The following season, he joined Milan in exchange for Luciano Chiarugi, with whom he shared the nickname Cavallo Pazzo (\\"Crazy\\" or \\"Mad Horse\\", in Italian). During his first season with Milan, he won the 1976‚Äì77 Coppa Italia, and was also the top-scorer of the tournament, with 6 goals. Style of play Braglia was nicknamed Cavallo Pazzo (mad horse) by the Napoli fans, due to his energetic runs up and down the flank. His long hair and moustache made him a highly recognisable player. A talented player, he was capable of playing both as a midfielder and as a forward, and was known for his dribbling skills and eye for goal; however, he also earned a reputation throughout his career as a player who had a tendency to miss easy goalscoring chances, and for being tactically undisciplined.

Biography  Elena Palmer is the author of the biography ‚ÄûPeter III - The Prince of Holstein‚Äú (Sutton Publishing, Germany, 2005), herein she is expressing reasonable doubt towards the common portrayal of Russian emperor Peter III. In her work Palmer is referencing and questioning Peter III's wife Catherine the Great's memoirs. According to Palmer's research Catherine initiated Peter's murder and illegally succeeded his throne, while later characterizing him as an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù, ‚Äúdrunkard of Holstein‚Äù, ‚Äúgood-for-nothing‚Äù in order to improve her own bad reputation among the people of Russia. Elena Palmer says: \\"Peter III was neither a drunkard nor a moron. His plans for the dramatic transformation of society reveal a young Emperor's vision that was far ahead of his contemporaries. Peter took a position of ‚Äúenlightened absolutism‚Äù, which was very new and progressive for this period in Russian history. With his democratic approaches, Peter was in a position to lead Russia out of the impasse of feudalism and was able to create a new social order without bloodshed. He proved his fortitude with ambitious reforms and gave the country hope for economic and social advancements. There were no political reasons for Peter‚Äôs overthrow, as the people loved their Emperor and his supporters idolized him. Rather, the fate of Peter III was a family tragedy the likes of a Shakespeare drama. The queen‚Äôs lover killed her husband while she silently supported him in this treacherous act\\" Thanks to her knowledge of both old German and old Russian languages and after having spent months in Russian and German historical archives Palmer has found out a different truth about Peter III: a cultivated, open-minded emperor who tried to introduce various courageous, even democratic reforms in the 18th century Russia. Her work is considered unique in its unbiased and scientifically correct historical information.J.von Dube. Der Zar, der ein Kieler war. Kieler Nachrichten. 12.13.2003Slovo pravdy. Moscow, Nauka, 2006 In her book she called upon the German people to revise the account and to build a monument for Peter III. As a result, a fundraiser association has been established, and the monument has been built in Kiel by A. Taratynov. On 2018 another monument erected in Oranienbaum palace complex, Russia. Palmer earned her PhD in History from Eastern Illinois University in 2003. Her ongoing research on Russian-German history includes the entire reign of Romanov-Holstein-Gottorp's dynasty from its founder Peter III. to the last Russian emperor, Nicholas II.

Early life  A great- grandchild of the eminent scientist and Unitarian minister Joseph Priestley (1733‚Äì1804), Bessie Rayner Parkes was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England to loving, well-off parents, in a household interested in people and ideas.Ancestry.com. England & Wales, Christening Index, 1530-1980 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2008. Genealogical Society of Utah. British Isles Vital Records Index, 2nd Edition. Salt Lake City, Utah: Intellectual Reserve, copyright 2002. Used by permission. Her father was Joseph Parkes (1796‚Äì1865), a prosperous solicitor and a liberal with Radical sympathies. His support for his daughter's aspirations was moderate. Bessie's mother, Elizabeth Rayner Priestley (1797‚Äì1877), usually called Eliza, was a wife and mother, who always considered herself an American, having been born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. She remembered her grandfather with admiration and love. Although not in great sympathy with her daughter over Bessie's strong wish to make changes in the status of women, Elizabeth nevertheless loved her dearly and did not actively oppose her. Unusually for girls of her background, Bessie was sent to a progressive Unitarian boarding school at age 11, a period of her life which she enjoyed. Parkes' passion for writing stemmed from the cultured life she was exposed to as a child, as her parents were avid consumers of the arts. Self-taught poetry was Parkes's earliest passion, which later led her to use her talents in her activism.  Activism  Parkes became gradually aware of the unjust, contradictory, and even absurd situation of women in Great Britain, though there were many differences according to the social class they belonged to. The first endeavor that Parkes and her friend Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon took on was to try to change the restrictive property laws that applied to married women, see Married Women's Property Act 1870. In the 1831 England Census, Parkes is listed as visiting Barbara Leigh Smith and her family at their home, 9 Pelham Crescent, Hastings, Sussex.Class: HO107; Piece: 1635; Folio: 371; Page: 31; GSU roll: 193538.

Parkes also joined a group called the Committee for the Ladies' Address to their American Sisters on Slavery in 1853. The group of women worked to secure 576,000 signatures on their anti- slavery petition in the United States. Around the same time Parkes also was starting to advocate for the education of young women with her essay \\"Remarks on the Education of Girls\\". In this essay Parkes outlined her concern that women were limited to very few careers and criticised society regarding how little power women had compared to men. Parkes was also indignant about the distinction made between \\"ladies\\" and \\"women\\". \\"Ladies\\", that is to say middle-class women, lost social status if they earned money, the only acceptable exceptions being writing, painting, or teaching, which for the most part meant governessing. Due in part to her efforts, by the close of the century, it became acceptable for a middle-class woman to acquire a proper education and train to do paid work. Working-class women had always belonged to the work force, whether they wanted to or not. Parkes and her activist friends interacted with women in other countries of Europe and in the United States, adding a very considerable international dimension to their efforts. In the 1860s, Parkes belonged to the first women's group which set out to obtain voting rights.  Friendships  Bessie Rayner Parkes' wide circle of literary and political friends included George Eliot, Harriet Martineau, Anna Jameson, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, Elizabeth Blackwell, Lord Shaftesbury, Herbert Spencer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Elizabeth Gaskell, William Thackeray, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, John Ruskin, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Her most fruitful friendship was with Barbara Bodichon, for out of their joint efforts grew the first organized women's movement in Britain. The closest friendship Rayner forged was her friendship with fellow activist Barbara Leigh Smith. They met in 1846, and their friendship inspired much of Parkes' work. After a trip around Europe they both felt deeply inspired to pursue the activism they would carry out later on in their lives.  The English Woman's Journal  Parkes became the principal editor of the first feminist British periodical ‚Äì the English Woman's Journal ‚Äì published monthly in London between 1858 and 1864. Its closure was due both to financial reasons and to the conflicts that arose among its sponsors and chief contributors. Parkes was one of the founders of The English Woman's Journal and it later became the hub for those wanting to participate in the women's right movement. The offshoots that sprang from it were many and varied, such as the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women, the Victoria Printing Press (entirely staffed by women), the Law-Copying Office, and the Langham Place Group, where women gathered informally to discuss their lives or simply have a rest. The journal was a very important part of the community and the women's right movement in England as it provided many women with employment and an education that could never be taken away from them.  The Victoria Printing Press  The Victoria Printing Press was a business venture started by Parkes in 1860 to aid in her plan for the education of young women. As Parkes was a firm believer in all young women being trained in some skill, the printing press was a way for her to address that problem. Parkes herself did not know how to print when she purchased the printing press, so she hired a man to teach her and then instructed her staff how to print. The Victoria Printing Press became the sole printer of The English Woman's Journal from 1860 until it closed in 1864. The press also printed The Transactions of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science and other publications that were in line with the views of Parkes, Smith and their all female staff. Parkes is quoted to have said to the women she was employing in her printing press that learning such a trade was \\"One dream of my life\\".  Conversion to Roman Catholicism  Another important part of Parkes' life story was her path to the Roman Catholic Church, to which she converted in 1864. After growing up in a radical Unitarian household Parkes, was familiar with Scripture from a young age. As she grew older Parkes found herself becoming more and more devout in the Christian faith. Comparing her earlier poetry to her later works, there are many Biblical references appearing while she was still a Unitarian, which only became more prominent as Parkes reached older age. She kept up with events occurring in the Oxford Movement, but what impressed her was the social work carried out by Catholic nuns. She knew three English Cardinals personally, and recalled them in her writings.  Marriage and children  Aged 38, Bessie Rayner Parkes fell in love with a Frenchman of delicate health, named Louis Belloc, himself the son of a notable woman, Louise Swanton Belloc. She met her husband on a trip to La Celle St. Cloud with her friend Barbara Smith, now Bodichon. Louis had never been the healthiest of men when they had met, being diagnosed with unspecified brain inflammation. They were married on September 19, 1867 at St. James Catholic Church in London. Their five-year-long marriage, spent in France, was lovingly recounted by their daughter in her memoir, I Too Have Lived in Arcadia (the title is a reference to Et in Arcadia ego). They very quickly got pregnant and had two healthy children, but Parkes did have one miscarriage. The family lived through the Franco-Prussian War and was deeply affected by it on a material level. It appears that the family relocated to England prior to the death of her husband, at least temporarily. In the 1871 England Census, Parkes and her husband are misspelled as the \\"Bellor\\" family instead of the Bellocs; they resided with their two small children, Marie and Joseph, at 11 College Street, Westminster.Class: RG10; Piece: 118; Folio: 78; Page: 3; GSU roll: 838768.

Parkes' husband suddenly died of sunstroke in 1872. After the death of husband Parkes moved back to England where she never truly got over the death of her husband. Their children, Marie Belloc Lowndes (1868‚Äì1947) and Joseph Hilaire Belloc (1870‚Äì1953), went on to become renowned writers in their different ways. In 1902, Joseph, married and the father of three children, applied for naturalisation in Britain; he gave as his residence 104 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London and his occupation as a staff Lecturer of the University of Oxford extension scheme.The National Archives; Kew, Surrey, England; Duplicate Certificates of Naturalisation, Declarations of British Nationality, and Declarations of Alienage; Class: HO 334; Piece: 33.

The National Archives, Kew, England.  Later life  Parkes continued to write until late in life and remained a keen observer of politics and society. However, following her marriage and the death of her husband, her active involvement in the organized women's movements abated. She went to and traveled in the United States with her son in 1896 and continued writing. Parkes published five more works in the last 30 years of her life. Anguish over the stupidity of war and pride in her country colored her feelings during the First World War. Almost at its close, her eldest grandchild, a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, went missing. He was shot down and killed near Cambrai, in France. She died in 1925, aged 95. At her death Parkes left ¬£3,688 in her will, which is the equivalent to ¬£222,355, in 2019.  Published work  Bessie Rayner Parkes published fourteen books: poetry, essays, biography, memoirs, travel, and literature for children and adolescents, as well as a very effective booklet on women's rights and dozens of articles. Much of her literary work was well received during her lifetime and her poetry was admired by John Ruskin and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  Poems (London, John Chapman, 1852)  Poems was Parkes' first book to be published. It contained 66 poems, most of written upon the theme of nature. Much of this can be attributed to the inspiration Parkes drew from her trip around Europe with her lifelong friend Barbara Leigh Smith, in 1850. The injustices she saw as she traveled around Europe were also an inspiration for her work and also sparked her need to advocate for women's equal rights.

The French troops arrived by invitation in 1548 and left in 1560 after an English force arrived to attempt to assist in removing them from Scotland. The town was not taken by force and the French troops finally left peacefully under the terms of a treaty signed by Scotland, England and France.Knight, p. 120 Background James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, Regent of Scotland from 1542 to 1554 The Auld Alliance and Reformation of religion Scotland and France had long been allies under the \\"Auld Alliance\\", first established in the 13th century. However, during the 16th century, divisions appeared between a pro-French faction at Court and Protestant reformers. The Protestants saw the French as a Catholic influence and, when conflict broke out between the two factions, called on English Protestants for assistance in expelling the French from Scotland. In 1542, King James V of Scotland died, leaving only a week-old daughter who was proclaimed Mary, Queen of Scots.The Peerage ‚Äî James V, accessed March 2010 James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, was appointed Regent and agreed to the demand of King Henry VIII of England that the infant Queen should marry his son Edward. This policy was soon reversed, however, through the influence of Mary's mother Mary of Guise and Cardinal Beaton, and Regent Arran rejected the English marriage offer. He then successfully negotiated a marriage between the young Mary and Fran√ßois, Dauphin of France. War of the Rough Wooing Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland from 1554 to 1560 The English King Henry VIII, angered by the Scots reneging on the initial agreement, made war on Scotland in 1544‚Äì1549, a period which the writer Sir Walter Scott later christened the \\"Rough Wooing\\". In May 1544 an English army landed at Granton and captured Leith to land heavy artillery for an assault on Edinburgh Castle, but withdrew after burning the town and the Palace of Holyrood over three days. Three years later, following another English invasion and victory at Pinkie Cleugh in 1547, the English attempted to establish a \\"pale\\" within Scotland.Lynch, p.69 Leith was of prime strategic importance because of its vital role as Edinburgh's port, handling its foreign trade and essential supplies. The English arrived in Leith on 11 September 1547 and camped on Leith Links. The military engineer Richard Lee scouted around the town on 12 September looking to see if it could be made defensible. On 14 September the English began digging a trench on the south-east side of Leith near the Firth of Forth. William Patten wrote that the work was done as much for exercise as for defence, since the army only stayed for five days.Patten, William, The Expedition into Scotland of Edward Duke of Somerset (Richard Grafton, London, 1548), reprinted in Tudor Tracts, London (1903) pp.136-7, 141: see also Pollard, Tony, (2009), p.181-2. In response to the English invasion the Scottish Court looked to France for assistance, and on 16 June 1548 the first French troops arrived in Leith, soon to total 8,000 men commanded by Andr√© de Montalembert sieur d'Esse.Mowat, pp.114‚Äì115 The infant Queen Mary was removed to France the following month and the English cause was effectively lost. Most of their troops had left by the end of 1549. In the following years the French interest became dominant in Scotland with increasing numbers of French troops concentrated in Haddington, Broughty Castle, and Leith. From 1548 onwards work began fortifying the port of Leith initially with a bulwark at the Kirkgate and at the chapel by the harbour, perhaps designed by the Italian Migliorino Ubaldini.Henry Ellis, Original Letters Illustrative to British History, series 3 vol.3 (London, 1846), pp.299-300. The rest of the new fortifications were almost certainly designed by another Italian military engineer, Piero di Strozzi, and these represent the earliest use of the trace italienne style of artillery fortification in Britain.Harris, p.360 In August 1548 Strozzi directed the 300 Scottish workmen from a chair carried by four men because he had been shot in the leg at Haddington.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), 158. In 1554, Mary of Guise, the Catholic French widow of James V, was appointed Regent in place of the Earl of Arran, who had been made Duke of Ch√¢tellerault by Henry II of France. Guise continued the pro-French policy, appointing Frenchmen to key positions. In September 1559 she continued to improve the fortification at Leith with works which were probably designed by Lorenzo Pomarelli, an Italian architect and military engineer.Amadio Ronchini, 'Lorenzo Pomarelli' in Atti e memorie delle RR. Deputazioni di storia patria per le provincie Modenesi e Parmensi (Modena, 1868), pp. 264-5, 271: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 252-5. The Reformation crisis Head of the statue of John Knox, New College, Edinburgh Meanwhile, the Protestant Scots became increasingly restless, particularly after the marriage of Mary and Fran√ßois in 1558. A group of noblemen, styling themselves the Lords of the Congregation, appointed themselves leaders of the anti-French, Protestant party, aligning themselves with John Knox and other religious reformers. They raised 12,000 troops in an attempt to oust the French from Scotland. Arran changed sides, joining the Lords of the Congregation. Meanwhile, Henry II of France was accidentally killed in a jousting tournament and Mary's husband became King of France on 10 July 1559. During 1559 the Lords of the Congregation dominated most of central Scotland and entered Edinburgh, forcing Mary of Guise to retreat to Dunbar Castle. However, with the aid of 2,000 French troops, she regained control of the capital in July. A short-lived truce was made with the Articles of Leith on 25 July 1559. Guise received further military aid from France, thanks to the influence of Jacques de la Brosse and the Bishop of Amiens.Hayward, p.43 The Lords considered this assistance a breach of the Leith articles. Ch√¢tellerault wrote to summon other Scottish lords at the start of October 1559 to resolve their situation: > ...it is not unknawin how the Franchmen hes begun mair nor 20 dayis to > fortifie the toun of Leyth, tending thairthrow to expell the inhabitantis > thairoff and plant thame selffis, thair wyffis and bairnis thairintill > suppressing the libertie of this realme.Cameron, Annie I., Scottish > Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 428‚Äì9, > Ch√¢tellerault to Lord Semple, 6 October 1559. Mary of Guise responded by making a proclamation on 2 October and writing to Lord Seton, Provost of Edinburgh, that it was well known that Leith was fortified as a response to the Congregation's intent to come in arms to Edinburgh on 8 October 1559, rather than to accommodate French troops and their families. She wrote \\"we could do no less than provide ourselves with some sure retreat for ourselves and our company if we were pursued.\\" The French, she said, had not brought their families.Harvey, P., 'Three Scottish Documents', in British Museum Quarterly vol. 25 no. 3/4 (1962), pp. 80-82 (spelling modernized here): Guise's proclamation appears in Knox & Calderwood's histories. Landowners affected by the new fortification works were compensated, one merchant William Dawson was granted exemption from any future customs duties for the loss of his building in North Leith.Donaldson, Gordon, Register of the Great Seal, vol.6 (Edinburgh, 1963), p. 325 no. 325. The Lords of the Congregation suspended Guise's regency and appealed to the Protestant Queen Elizabeth for English military support.Hayward, p.44 In response to the situation, Elizabeth appointed the Duke of Norfolk to lead an expedition, and he travelled north to meet the Scots leaders at Berwick, and concluded the Treaty of Berwick. By this treaty England now recognised the Lords of the Congregation as a power in Scotland, and safeguards were agreed for an English military intervention against the French in Scotland with provisions for their withdrawal. The Siege=Preparations for the siege 19th century plan showing the French fortifications of 1560 The French army continued to strengthen the fortifications of Leith during late 1559. The defences included eight projecting bastions, including Ramsay's Fort protecting the harbour, \\"Little london\\" at the north-east, and the Citadel at the north-west.Harris, p.363 Within the walls was a raised platform for guns, called a \\"cavalier\\" by the anonymous French journalist of the siege.Dickinson, Gladys, 'A Journal of the Siege of Leith', in Two Missions of de la Brosse (SHS, Edinburgh, 1942). At the end of January 1560, an English fleet, under the command of William Wynter, arrived in the Firth of Forth, having sailed north from the naval base at Queenborough Castle in the Thames Estuary. English diplomats claimed Wynter's arrival in the Firth was accidental, and Norfolk told Wynter to act as if he was a maverick with no commission.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 293-5. The ships were sent by William Cecil under the authority of Queen Elizabeth. On 2 February, a proclamation was issued in the name of the Queen of Scots to summon the men of Selkirk and Jedburgh to be ready to mobilise against the \\"wicked doings of the English ships\\" in Scottish waters, and the intended invasion of the Merse and East Lothian.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 316 no. 649 (3). Portrait once thought to be Grey of Wilton, Scottish National Portrait Gallery After the Treaty of Berwick provided a framework for an English military incursion, the English made plans to bring the army and guns to Leith. Considering the weather and difficulties of the road into Scotland, on 8 February 1559 Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk and Lord Grey de Wilton wrote to the Lords of Congregation from Newcastle; \\"we find greate difficultie of the cariadge of the same by land at this tyme of the yere, as well by reason of the deepe and foule wayes between Barwick and Lythe, as also that for such a number of cariadges and draught horses as the same doth require can not be had in time, and therefore we suppose the same must of necessity be transported by sea, and the number of footmen also appointed for this journey to be set on land as near unto Lythe as may be convenientlie. And in that case, our horsemen to enter by land as soon as we have intelligence of the landing of our footmen.\\"Haynes, Collection of State Papers (London, 1740), pp. 237-8: Source, TNA SP52/2/42. In the event, an army of around 6,000 English soldiers, under Lord Grey de Wilton marched from Berwick, arriving in early April to join up with the Scottish Lords.Hayward, p.51‚Äì52 Passing through Dunglass and Lintonbriggs, the English army camped at Prestongrange on 4 April where the lighter artillery pieces for the siege were landed from ships at Aitchison's Haven.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp.340-346. Just before this English army arrived, the French raided Glasgow and Linlithgow.McCrie, Thomas, Life of John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1814), pp. 410‚Äì12, Appendix no. 18. The French garrison at Haddington had withdrawn to the prepared position at Leith, swelling the number of French troops there to an estimated 3,000. Meanwhile, Mary of Guise and her advisors stayed secure in Edinburgh Castle from 28 March 1560. The Keeper of the castle, John Erskine declared it neutral, and this was respected by both sides, and the castle played no part in the conflict. Before the English army arrived at Leith, the commander William Grey of Wilton considered that capturing the castle with the Queen Regent might be a better option. However, the Duke of Norfolk advised him against it, as their proper target was the French soldiery in Leith, not Erskine's Scottish garrison.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 346 no. 710, p. 340 no. 714. Battle of Restalrig When the Duke of Norfolk arrived at Berwick in January 1560, Mary of Guise's military advisor Jacques de la Brosse wrote to him saying he did not believe the rumour in Edinburgh that Norfolk was Elizabeth's lieutenant-general in Scotland, there to attack the French and favour the rebels, against the peace treaty between Scotland and England. However, that was exactly Norfolk's mission.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 288 no. 615 (1). Norfolk remained at Berwick, instructed that Grey of Wilton was to have charge of \\"martial affairs\\" in Scotland, as Grey himself wished, while Ralph Sadler, a long-serving diplomat, was to forward a peaceable settlement with Mary of Guise by diplomacy, liaising with the Duke of Ch√¢tellerault and his party. Elizabeth appointed James Croft to be Grey of Wilton's deputy. Ralph Sadler was given Grey's border administrative roles at Berwick upon Tweed.Clifford, Arthur, ed., Sadler State Papers, vol.1 (1809), pp. 708, 719-21. Grey of Wilton set his camp at Restalrig village on 6 April 1560 and twice offered to parley with Mary of Guise and the French military commander Henri Cleutin, Sieur d'Oysel et Villeparisis via the English Berwick Pursuivant.Hayward, p.53 This offer was refused, and the English herald Rouge Croix was sent to demand that the French withdraw from the field into Leith. Cleutin replied that his troops were on his master and mistress's ground. Soon after this exchange fighting broke out at Restalrig with casualties on both sides. Some French mounted arquebusiers who pursued an English detachment were killed on the slopes above Leith, or captured by the sea-shore. Over 100 French casualties were reported with 12 officers killed and a number of prisoners taken.Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (SHS, Edinburgh, 1942), pp. 99-101. George Buchanan and John Hayward's 17th century history make the point that the French were trying to secure the high-ground to the south of Leith: Hawkhill, the crag (at Lochend), and the chapel, which the French journalist of the siege called the \\"Magdalene Chapel\\". Hayward and Mary's secretary John Lesley mentioned that George Howard and James Croft were parleying with Mary of Guise at the spur blockhouse of Edinburgh Castle when the fighting started.Bruce, John, Annals of the first four years by John Hayward (1840), pp.52-53: Lesley, John, (Thomson ed.), History of Scotland(Edinburgh, 1827), p. 283: Buchanan, George, History of Scotland, Bk. 16, chp. LVII, Aikman trans., vol.2 (Glasgow, 1827), p. 423. Mount Pelham Grey of Wilton set up headquarters Norfolk reported that, \\"Restaricke Deanrie is so sweete, that our campe lyeth not within halfe a myle and more of our trenches.\\"CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 366. The English began constructing their siege-works against the town in mid-April. There were trenches on the Hawkhill ridge north of Restalrig and towards Lochend Castle. South of Leith Links, at the latter-day site of Hermitage House, below the Magdalen Chapel on the ridge,Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (SHS: 1942), pp. 115, 123, 131, 137. there was a fortlet, \\"Mount Pelham\\" named after the captain of the pioneers, William Pelham. The fort faced across the present-day Leith Links towards the eastern side of the town and South Leith Church. Mount Pelham was developed from a trench dug on the night of 12 April and finished 13 days later as a sconce with four corner bastions. An eyewitness, Humfrey Barwick later wrote that he suggested that Pelham should begin his fort \\"at the fwte of this hill and run straight to yonder hillocke,\\" presumably meaning by hillock the \\"Giant's Brae\\" and \\"Lady Fyfe's Brae\\" on Leith Links.Humfrey, Barwick, A breefe discourse, concerning the force and effect of all manuall weapons of fire, London (1592), pp.4-5. Captain Cuthbert Vaughan was the fortlet's commander with 240 men. Five years earlier, Vaughan and James Croft had been imprisoned as supporters of Lady Jane Grey, and they subsequently took part in Wyatt's Rebellion. Vaughan was killed in 1563, at the siege of Newhaven in France.Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (London, 1892), pp. 45, 91: Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 12 (London, 1949), Simon Renard to Charles V, 24 February 1554: HMC 6th Report: Frank (London, 1877), p. 455. Both Holinshed and George Buchanan mention the fort was too far from Leith for its cannon to have much effect on the town.Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (1942), pp. 114-5, 130-1: CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 2, (London, 1865), p. 586, no. 1073: Holinshed, Raphael, The Scottish Chronicle (London, 1805), p. 304: Buchanan, George, History of Scotland, Bk. 16, chp. LVIII, Aikman trans., vol. 2 (Glasgow, 1827), p. 423. While the English were at work in April the French also constructed and manned entrenchments outside of the main walls encircling the town.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 367, no. 759. The bombardment The English had brought some small cannon with them. Holinshed records that the carriages and shot for the large siege guns were landed on 10 April and the guns on the next day.Holinshed, Raphael, vol. 4 (London, 1808), p. 192. The Scottish chronicle, the Diurnal of Occurents, notes that 27 heavier English artillery pieces were shipped to \\"Figgate\\" at Portobello. On 12 April, the French heard a rumour that the English believed they were underequipped, and their response was to give a salvo from their 42 cannon, killing 16 in the English camp.Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (SHS, Edinburgh, 1942), p. 115. The large guns were ready on Sunday 14 April, Easter day, and the English bombardment began.Hayward, p.55: Holinshed, vol.4, (1808), p.192. The cannon were placed in batteries to the west and south of Leith. According to a later chronicle, the History of the Estate of Scotland, the besiegers' guns were placed at the same distance of \\"twoe fflight shott\\" from South Leith church as Mount Pelham. The chronicle calls the location \\"Clayhills\\".Wodrow Miscellany, vol.1 (1844), p.84. The English plan of Leith, dated 7 July 1560, marks the position of the \\"first battery\\" to the south west of the Church, lying in front of the later gun position called \\"Mount Somerset\\", at Pilrig. The French journal also mentions Pilrig as well as the entrenchment at Pelham, and a rumour that the newly arrived English great guns would be placed in the trenches on Hawkhill to the south.Steer, Francis, PSAS (1961-2), 282 no. 33: Dickinson, Two Missions (Edinburgh, 1942), pp. 114-5. The French returned fire from cannon on the steeple of St Anthony's church, Logan's Bulwark, and the Sea Bulwark. John Lesley, Bishop of Ross, wrote that despite the bombardment, the French commanders and Father Andrew Leich celebrated Easter mass in South Leith Parish Church. During the service a cannonball passed harmlessly in through a window and out of the church door, while outside the air was thick with broken stone and plaster. This story was omitted from the contemporary Scots Language manuscript of Lesley's History.De Origine Moribus & Rebus Gestis Scotorum (Rome, 1675), 523-4: Cody, ed., Dalrymple's Lesley, vol. 2 (SHS, Edinburgh, 1895), pp. 436-7. Mount Pelham overwhelmed The Giant's Brae on Leith Links, near the site of the 1560 siegework Mount Pelham The next day, 16 April, according to the French journal of the siege, 60 French cavalry and 1,200 foot soldiers overwhelmed the unfinished English position at Mount Pelham and spiked four cannons, killing 200 men and taking officers as prisoners. Arthur Grey, the son and biographer of Grey de Wilton, who was commander of a company of demi-lance horsemen, was shot twice, but was not in danger of losing his life. The French were repulsed and Norfolk reported 150 killed on both sides.Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (1942), p.117-119: HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol.1 (London, 1883), p. 211: CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p.366. Humfrey Barwick blamed Arthur Grey's injury on William Pelham not securing the position properly while the fortlet was under construction.Humfrey, Barwick, A breefe discourse, concerning the force and effect of all manuall weapons of fire, etc (London, 1592), pp.4-5. According to a poem by Thomas Churchyard, a Scotswoman initiated this attack by signalling an opportunity to the French. She came with Scottish victuallers to the English position and made her sign from a crag where a cannon had been placed. This story may refer to the existing mounds near the site of Mount Pelham called the \\"Giant's Brae\\" and \\"Lady Fyfe's Brae\\".Chalmers, George, ed., Churchyard's Chips concerning Scotland, pp.98-100. The Leith historian Alexander Campbell, writing in 1827, regarded the mounds as important monuments of the siege, writing that the eastern mound took its name from \\"Lady Fife's Well\\", and children called the larger mound by the Grammar School \\"the Giant's Brae\\".Campbell, Alexander, The History of Leith (1827), pp. 348-9. This was repeated by D.H. Robertson, and the 1852 Ordnance Survey map marked the Giant's Brae as (the remains of) Somerset's Battery with Lady Fyfe's Brae as (the remains of) Pelham's Battery. A more recent historian, Stuart Harris, dismissed the assertion that these mounds were siegeworks rather than natural hillocks, stating that the belief was a \\"spurious 'tradition\\".Harris, p.368 The Diurnal of Occurrents records another attack on the completed Mount Pelham on 18 June by 300 French soldiers who were chased back to Leith by 30 English cavalry. Forty French were killed, seven captured, and the English lost their trumpeter.Thomas Thomson, Diurnal of Occurrents (Edinburgh, 1833), p.59. Mount Somerset, Mount Falcon, and Byer's Mount Modern plaque at the site of the Mount Falcon battery At the end of April the siege works were extended westwards and a new emplacement built in the vicinity of the later Pilrig House, named \\"Mount Somerset\\" after Captain Francis Somerset, whom Thomas Churchyard identifies as the brother of the Earl of Worcester.Harris, p.364 Among the Scots recorded at the siege at this time, on 27 April 1560 with a tent (palzoun) at the Water of Leith, were Robert and John Haldane of Gleneagles.Protocol Book of Gilbert Grote (SRS, Edinburgh, 1914), p. 42 no. 191. The works were continued further west and north, across the Water of Leith to Bonnington, where a series of batteries were established. \\"Mount Falcon\\" was built after 7 May 1560 and, according to John Lesley, commanded the houses on the Shore quayside. The battery was placed west of a bend in the Water of Leith, near the intersection of South Fort Street and West Bowling Green Street. A position to the north with a single cannon is marked \\"Byere Mownt\\" on the Petworth map. Stuart Harris locates the gun's position near the intersection of the present-day Ferry Road and Dudley Avenue South.Lesley, John, Thomson ed., History of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1827), p.285: Harris (1991), p.365: Steer (1961-2), no.37. The completed emplacements stretched for approximately around the fortified town, with six gun sites at a distance of around from the Leith ramparts. Mounts Pelham and Somerset, named after their officers, were both large temporary forts with ramparts up to high. Apart from the foot soldiers, there were, on 25 May 145 English artillery-men, with 750 English and 300 Scottish pioneers or labourers working on the fortifications, and 468 men looking after work- horses.Samuel Haynes, State Papers (London, 1740), p.348, Valentine Browne's certificate. 7 May - an English defeat Elizabeth and her secretary William Cecil were exerting pressure on Norfolk for a result at Leith. To show that progress was being made, Norfolk started forwarding Grey's dispatches and apologising for his depute's \\"humour\\", asking that Elizabeth should send Grey a letter showing her thanks.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.388: Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth 1559‚Äì1560, Longman (1865), no.1050, 1078. Norfolk brought in expert military advisors, Sir Richard Lee and his own cousin Sir George Howard, who Norfolk believed would bring the siege to a rapid conclusion. Norfolk wrote to William Cecil on 27 April that it was a shame to have \\"to lie so long at a sand wall.\\"HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 1 (London, 1883), p. 215: Haynes, State Papers (London, 1740), p. 299. It was planned to storm the town before daybreak on 7 May. In early May cannon were deployed to make a substantial breach in the western ramparts.Harris, p.362 The assault was to be carried out in two waves, the first at 3.00 am by 3,000 men, the second by 2,240, with a further 2,400 holding back to keep the field. William Winter would wait for a signal to land 500 troops on the quayside of the Water of Leith at the Shore inside the town. As a diversion, Cuthbert Vaughan's 1,200 men with 500 Scotsmen were to attack from the south, crossing Leith Links from Mount Pelham. James Croft's men would assault from the north-west, presumably at low-tide. There was an accidental fire in Leith on 1 May which burnt in the south-west quarter. The next evening Grey planted his battery against the west walls and started firing before 9.00 am, writing to Norfolk that his gunners had not yet found their mark. The next day, Grey was worried that the French had effected repairs so the town appeared even stronger. He continued with the bombardment and ordered his captains to try small-scale assaults against the walls to gather intelligence. Cuthbert Vaughan measured the ditch and ramparts for making scaling ladders.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.363 Grey of Wilton's orders for the assault, 2 May 1560, pp. 395-6, p.400 no.778 (2) final order of the assault. The attempt was now scheduled for 4.00 am on Tuesday 7 May and by two hours past daylight the English were defeated. Although there were two breaches, the damage to the walls was insufficient. None of the flanking batteries were disabled, and the scaling ladders were too short. The result was heavy losses estimated at 1000 to 1500 Scots and English. A report by Peter Carew estimated a third of the dead were Scottish. However, Carew's total of six-score dead, which was followed by George Buchanan, is roughly a tenth of the other reports.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, (1883), p. 220, 227: Haynes (1740), pp. 310, 345, 347. The accountant and victualler of Berwick, Sir Valentine Browne noted there were 1,688 men unable to serve, still on the payroll, hurt at the assault or at various other times, and now sick or dead.Haynes (1740), p.348. The author of the Diurnal of Occurents put the total number slain at 400.Diurnal of Occurents, p.59. Humfrey Barwick was told the French collected the top-coats of the English who had reached and died on the walls, and 448 were counted.Humfrey, Barwick, A breefe discourse, concerning the force and effect of all manuall weapons of fire and the disability of the long bowe or archery, in respect of others of greater force now in vse (London, 1592), p.16. The French journal claims only 15 defenders were killed. John Knox and the French journal attributed some of the casualties to the women of Leith throwing stones from the ramparts. According to Knox, Mary of Guise surveyed her victory from the fore-wall of Edinburgh Castle with some pleasure, comparing the English dead laid on the walls of Leith to fair tapestry, laid out to air in the sun: > \\"The Frenche, prowd of the victorie, strypit naikit all the slayne, and laid > thair carcassis befoir the hot sune alang thair wall, quhair thay sufferit > thame to lye ma dayis nor ane, unto the quhilk, quhen the Quene Regent > luikit, for myrth sche happit and said, 'Yonder are the fairest tapestrie > that I ever saw, I wald that the haill feyldis that is betwix this place and > yon war strewit with the same stuiffe.'\\"Laing, David, ed., Works of John > Knox: History of the Reformation, vol. 2, Wodrow Society (1846), pp.67-8. Knox thought James Croft had not wholeheartedly played his part. Carew heard that Croft should have attacked a breach in the Pale: instead his men \\"ran up between the Church and the water.\\"Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (Edinburgh, 1942), 144‚Äì145: Haynes (1740) p. 346. Norfolk blamed Croft, who he believed colluded with Guise, later writing, \\"I thought a man could not have gone nigher a traitor than Sir James, I pray God make him a good man.\\"HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, vol. 1 (London, 1883), 219‚Äì220, 241. Richard Lee made a map of Leith, which Norfolk sent to London on 15 May. This map or \\"platte\\" was perhaps made as much for the enquiry into the 7 May events as for future works.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 1 (1883), 222, Norfolk to Cecil, 15 May 1560. Elizabeth read Carew and Valentine's reports and sent them to William Cecil with instructions to keep them safe and secret.Haynes (1740), p.344-5, Thomas Parry to Cecil, 3 July 1560. Mines and code Now diplomatic efforts for peace were re-doubled, but the siege was tightened. The English brought specialists from Newcastle upon Tyne to dig mines towards the fortifications. Mary of Guise, who was very ill by this time, wrote a letter to d'Oysel asking him to send her drugs from Leith. This letter was passed to Grey of Wilton who was suspicious because medicines could be easily found in Edinburgh. According to John Knox, he held the letter in the heat of a fire and discovered a message in invisible ink. Grey threw the letter on the fire.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, p.70. The French journal of the siege puts the story on 5 May, and says that Guise required ointment from one Baptiste in Leith, and the secret cipher on the back of the letter was \\"insert the notice of the English enterprise and other matters.\\" Grey spoilt the letter looking for the secret writing and could not return it to James Drummond, the trumpet messenger.Dickinson, Two Missions (SHS, Edinburgh, 1942), pp. 140-143. Coded letters were carried out of Leith by another soldier, a drummer messenger of the Lords of the Congregation. First, Captain Sarlabous got him to take a note to a lady-in-waiting of Mary of Guise which had a secret cipher on the back. On 9 May he took a message with a handkerchief containing information about the English mines.Dickinson, Two Missions (SHS, Edinburgh, 1942), pp.146-147. Mary of Guise sent letters to d'Oysel describing what her spies had found out about these works. On 19 May she wrote in code that the English were mining at the Citadel, St Anthony's Flanker, and the Mill Bulwark. The English were confident that their mines would be deeper than any French counter-mines. Guise now found it more difficult to send her letters into Leith, and this one was captured and deciphered.CSP Scotland, vol. 1, pp. 410-11 no. 797. The English ambassador in France, Nicholas Throckmorton, discovered that Mary of Guise had obtained details of the plans for the 7 May assault. She had also changed her ciphers. Throckmorton intercepted a letter meant for Jacques de la Brosse from Mary of Guise's brothers. He hoped to infiltrate his agent Ninian Cockburn into Leith posing as the messenger. He gave Ninian, a captain in the Garde √âcossaise, the alias \\"Beaumont\\".CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 3, pp. 70-74, no. 116, Amboise, 22 May 1560: Forbes, Full View of the Public Transcations of Queen Elizabeth, vol 1 (London, 1740), p.473. By 18 June 1560, after Mary of Guise had died, the French at Edinburgh Castle realised their cipher was in English hands, and they advised the Leith garrison to continue to use the code in letters that might be captured, to spread disinformation that would be advantageous in the ongoing peace negotiations. The coded advice letter itself was intercepted by the English and deciphered. It also suggested the use of fire signals to advertise how much longer they could last, as food was short, for the benefit of the French diplomats at Edinburgh Castle. Signal beacons were to be lit on St Anthony's Church or the Citadel or both, half an hour before midnight.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 426 no. 820. Hunger in Leith On 8 May, after the assault, Grey sent Francis Killinghale to London carrying a detailed analysis of the situation. Grey was worried about deserters \\"stealing\\" back into England, but he thought that with reinforcements he could take the town by storm, or enclose it and starve out the garrison, as there was already \\"great scarcity\\" within. Ralph Sadler also wrote of desertions and the weariness of the besiegers.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 400-1, 405. The French continued to make sallies from the town, despite their dwindling provisions. The besiegers, conversely, were supplied with more troops and provisions from England and Scotland.Hayward, p.65‚Äì67 Grey described his men killing 40 or 50 French soldiers and others who came out of the town to gather cockles and periwinkles on 13 May.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.407 The French journalist wrote of the same event, relating that some of the hungry townspeople went out to collect shell-fish and were attacked by the English. A little French boy taken on the shore was brought to Grey of Wilton. When asked if they had enough food for a fortnight, the boy said he had heard the captains say the English would not take the town by famine or force for four or five months yet.Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (1942), pp. 157-9, as 13 May, he wrote \\"garses et goujatz: cobbers & trollops,\\" meaning the ordinary people of the town. Raphael Holinshed puts this event on 4 July, saying that Grey first issued a warning to d'Oysel about the cockle-pickers. The 17th century writer John Hayward gave a description of famine in the town based on the account of an English prisoner in Leith called Scattergood. He said the inhabitants and troops were reduced to eating horses, dogs, cats and vermin, with leaves, weeds and grass, \\"seasoned with hunger\\". > \\"Hereupon they grewe very short in strength of men, and no lesse short in > provision of foode for those men which they had; the one happeninge to tress > for them by the force of their enimies, the other either by disabilitie or > negligence of their freinds; so, their old stoore beinge spent, they were > inforced to make use of every thinge out of which hunger was able to drawe > nourishement. The fleshe of horses was then more daintie then ever they > esteemed venison before; doggs, catts, and vermine of more vile nature were > highelie valued; vines were striped of their leaves and tender stalkes; > grasse and weedes were picked up, and, beinge well seasoned with hunger, > were reputed amonge (them) for dainties and dilicate dishes.\\"Bruce, John, > Annals of the First Four years of Elizabeth by John Hayward (1840), p. 67. Holinshed mentions Hayward's source, Scattergood, as a spy who entered Leith pretending to be a fugitive or deserter.Holinshed, Raphael, (1808), p. 199 Peter Carew reported on 28 May 1560 that the French had no meat or drink except water for three weeks. There was only bread and salted salmon. These were rationed with 126 ounces of bread for a man each day and a salmon between six men each week. There were 2,300 French soldiers in Leith and more than 2,000 others.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, (1740), p. 345. After Mary of Guise died, a week's truce was declared on Monday 17 June. On 20 June, French and English soldiers ate together on the beach. Captain Vaughan, Andrew Corbett, Edward Fitton and their men brought beef, bacon, poultry, wine and beer: the French brought cold roast capon, a horse pie and six roast rats.\\"CSP Foreign Elizabeth\\", vol.3, p.133 no.218: CSP Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.425 no.818, p.429 no.826 spelled \\"Filton\\" there, but see \\"Fytton\\" in muster p.438. Treaty of Edinburgh Mary of Guise tablet, Edinburgh Castle After the English defeat on 7 May, peace talks progressed with a dinner at Edinburgh Castle on 12 May for Mary of Guise and the Lords of the Congregation, but negotiations failed the next day when the French commanders in Leith were not permitted to come to the Castle and meet Guise to discuss the proposals.Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions (Edinburgh, 1942), pp.151-7. A fresh attempt at negotiations began in June. Commissioners, including the Count of Randon and the Bishop of Valence for the French, and William Cecil and Nicholas Wotton for the English, arrived in Edinburgh, only to find that Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland, had died at Edinburgh Castle on 11 June.Hayward, p.67‚Äì68 Her death demoralised the French, and the commissioners agreed a week's armistice on 17 June. This ended on 22 June, but the only further military action was a skirmish on 4 July.Hayward, p.68‚Äì69 Peace was agreed shortly after and proclaimed on 7 July in the names of Elizabeth, Queen of England, and Fran√ßois and Mary, King and Queen of France and Scotland. The peace became known as the Treaty of Leith or the Treaty of Edinburgh.Steer, p.280 It secured the withdrawal of both French and English troops from Scotland and effectively dissolved the Auld Alliance. By 17 July the foreign soldiers had left the city.Harris, p.359 The total number of French evacuated from Scotland to Calais under William Winter's supervision was 3,613 men, 267 women, and 315 children‚Äîin all 4,195 with Lord Seton and the Bishop of Glasgow. The terms of the treaty allowed 120 French soldiers to remain at Inchkeith and Dunbar, although the defences of Leith were to be immediately demolished. New outworks at Dunbar Castle, which were still being completed by an Italian military engineer in May, were scheduled for demolition.Haynes, Samuel, State Papers (London, 1740), p. 314: CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 448, 454. The defences of Leith were slighted by English soldiers on 15 July and some strong points or bulwarks undermined.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 449. A key term was that Fran√ßois and Mary should cease using the style and arms of the King and Queen of England. As Catholics, they regarded Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn, as illegitimate, leaving Mary herself as the rightful Queen. Their use of the English royal arms led the French to dub the campaign the \\"War of the Insignia\\".Fraser, p.129 Queen Mary never ratified the agreement, since by doing so she would have acknowledged Elizabeth as rightful Queen of England, and she did not wish to relinquish her own claim to the English throne. Edinburgh's town treasurer paid for the Shore of Leith to be cleaned after the evacuation, and a gun found in the ditches was taken to Edinburgh. A ship scuttled by the French to block the harbour of Newhaven was floated off in September 1560 over two successive high tides by men working from small boats.Adam, Robert, ed., Edinburgh Records, The Burgh Accounts (Edinburgh, 1899), pp.313-4. Two hundred Scottish workmen were working to remove the fortifications.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 498. Legacy=The School of War Crabbie's Warehouse in Great Junction Street follows the line of the French fortification As this was the first military conflict of the reign, Elizabethan writers called the siege the \\"School of War\\", a title used by Thomas Churchyard for his poem narrating the action of the siege.Thomas Churchyard, Churchyard's Chips concerning Scotland, Constable, London (1817), 88‚Äì115, : Goldwyn, Merril Harvey, 'Some Unpublished Manuscripts of Thomas Churchyard', in Studies in Philology, vol. 64 no. 2 (April 1967), p.149-151, citing British Library Cotton Caligula B.V. 74 fol.36-380, this manuscript claims Churchyard was present at the siege, and has two more stanzas praising the Duke of Norfolk which were omitted from the published text. The 17th- century playwright William Sampson set his The Vow-Breaker, or The Fayre Maid of Clifton around the soldiers recruited for Leith from Nottinghamshire under Captain Jervis Clifton. The Vow-Breaker, published in 1636, contains much historical detail. It is written as if it was performed at Nottingham Castle in September 1562 for a meeting between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots, which never took place.Sampson, William, The Vow-Breaker, or the Fayre Maid of Clifton (London, 1636): Sampson's collaborator Gervase Markham had links to Nottinghamshire and the Captain Markham at the siege. The 450th anniversary in 2010 saw a celebration of the end of the siege with performances in Leith of a new play telling the story. Archaeology and fortifications There is still significant evidence of the fortifications built by the French and batteries built by the English, and new examples were uncovered in 2001, 2002 and 2006. The site of the Mount Falcon battery near Byer's Mount is marked by a plaque, and the two mounds on Leith Links are scheduled monuments. The ramparts were ordered to be demolished at the conclusion of the siege by Edinburgh townsfolk on the orders of the Lords and Burgh council to, \\"make blockhouse and curtain equal with the ground.\\"Extracts of the Burgh Records of Edinburgh, 1557‚Äì1571, Edinburgh (1875), 69‚Äì70, 23 July 1560. However, some repairs to the walls were made in 1572 during the \\"War between Leith and Edinburgh\\" using turf.Accounts Treasurer Scotland vol. 12 (HMSO, Edinburgh, 1970), p. 304, \\"faill\\" is turf. In April 1594 supporters of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, rebels against James VI of Scotland, repaired the fortifications.Annie Isabella Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 305 no. 238. On 20 March 1639 Lord Newburgh reported on the activities of the Scottish Covenanters at Leith, where women were working on the walls; \\"they work hard at their new fortification at Leith, where the ladies and women of all sorts serve with wheelbarrows and baskets\\".Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland preserved at Belvoir castle, vol. 1 (London, 1905), p. 503. Women were rarely recorded in manual work on Scottish building sites, the other examples are at Dumbarton Castle (1620) and Inchkeith (1555). A part of the ramparts and the Citadel at the site of St Nicholas's Church at the north-west were reconstructed during the war of the Three Kingdoms in 1649. The master mason John Milne obtained stones from the demolition of houses that were adjacent to the walls of Edinburgh and from the Spur fortification at Edinburgh Castle.See plan circa 1681 in external links): Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh (1938), pp. 196-7, 250, 256, 260: A manuscript account of the 1649/50 reconstruction work is preserved in Edinburgh City Archives. The renewed fortifications were held for Charles II, as King of Scots. Leith and the Citadel were bombarded by Rear-Admiral Captain Hall on 29 July 1650 from the Liberty, the Heart frigate, the Garland and the Dolphin.A Large Relation of the Fight at Leith near Edenburgh (London, 1650), p. 3. In the 19th-century Great Junction Street and Constitution Street were laid along the line of the southern and eastern walls respectively.DH Robertson, The Sculptured Stones of Leith, fold-out map and see National Library of Scotland map website.

A baker from Germany, he was later the proprietor of the City Hotel. He was very active with a number of organisations, founded the German Benefit Association, and was the driving force behind the establishment of the German Church. Early life Johann George R√ºddenklau was born in Niedermeiser on 23 May 1829 and baptised two days later.Entry in the church book from Niedermeiser, held by the Protestant state church office in Kassel His birth name was later Anglicised by adopting John as his first name, and dropping the diaeresis from his surname. Niedermeiser is today a suburb of Liebenau in the district of Kassel, in Hesse, Germany. His parents were John Ruddenklau and his wife, Annie Gertrude Ruddenklau (n√©e Engelbrecht). The eldest of five children, he had two brothers and two sisters. John George Ruddenklau often signed documents and was referred to as J. G. Ruddenklau, but he was known by his middle name and he used George Ruddenklau in print when he needed to differentiate from his brother John. Ruddenklau was apprenticed as a baker. He moved to London in 1850 or 1851 where he continued to work in his profession. He was joined in London by his younger brother John Ruddenklau (Johannes R√ºddenklau; 30 August 1834 ‚Äì 16 May 1896), who worked there for some years before returning to Germany. John Ruddenklau, who had also trained as a baker, emigrated to New Zealand in 1856, and arrived in Lyttelton on the Joseph Fletcher in October 1856. He took up farming; first in Rangiora and then in Cust. In circa 1853, George Ruddenklau married Sarah Ann Workman in London. Their only child, Fanny Gertrude Ruddenklau, was born in 1854 in London. The family left London in 1857 to emigrate to Canterbury in New Zealand, following his brother. Historian George Macdonald has recorded that they arrived by the Bosworth, but the passenger list published by the Lyttelton Times on 23 December 1857 mentions his wife and daughter only. Life in New Zealand Original houses between High and Colombo Streets in the early 1860s: Ruddenklau, Eales Boarding House, Hopsack (grocer) and T. Thompkins (baker) Ruddenklau opened a bakery at the northern end of High Street, i.e. where it meets Colombo and Hereford Streets, on 7 May 1859; the premises were leased from William Wilson. In early 1861, he enlarged his premises and started selling cordials and other goods. In June 1861, he applied for a wine and beer licence. Ruddenklau gradually took over the four shops at the end of High Street facing the triangle that has since 2008 been known as Stewart Plaza and which for many decades held the Stewart Fountain. In August 1861, he opened the City Wine Vaults with his newly gained alcohol licence, and the bakery shifted around the corner into Colombo Street nearer to Cashel Street. At the same time, Ruddenklau entered into a partnership with James S. Hawley that lasted until July 1863. When the annual renewal of his alcohol licence was discussed in April 1863, Ruddenklau was told that he had to complete the building that he had shown the resident magistrates, or otherwise he could not expect a renewal the following year. Hansom cabs and carriages in front of the City Hotel in 1884 Exactly a year later, Ruddenklau opened the two-storey City Hotel on the site. Its frontage covered the whole length between Colombo and High Streets. Only two months later, a fire broke out in a building on the opposite side of Colombo Street and due to the night being very still, the fire could be contained by cutting a fire break through the block. In total, 14 houses were lost. At one point, the heat was so great that the fire ignited a building across the road, situated next to the City Hotel, but the fire service could quickly extinguish the flames. Yet another fire occurred in pretty much the same location in June 1867 and this time, the heat caused damage to Ruddenklau's building. In June 1864, Ruddenklau was elected president at the annual meeting of the Licensed Victuallers' Association. In December 1864, a gas network was installed in Christchurch, and the City Hotel was one of the first premises that made use of the new source of light. Only two months later, Ruddenklau had to defend a breach of the Public House Ordinance for failing to keep the entrance lamp of his hotel lit during the prescribed hours. On this occasion, the proprietor got cautioned by the resident magistrate Charles Bowen, but in September 1866, he was fined NZ¬£1 for the same offence. In August 1866, Ruddenklau enlarged the City Hotel premises. He engaged his fellow Christchurch city councillor, architect Samuel Farr, to design an adjacent brick building facing Colombo Street. Upstairs, a billiard room was fitted with a table acquired from John Thomas Peacock, one of the richest people in Christchurch. In 1867, Ruddenklau was one of the founders of the Canterbury Brewing, Malting and Distilling Company that was to be chaired and directed by George Oram, the eldest of five brothers working in the hotel industry. Ruddenklau retired from business in August 1869 and sold his hotel to John William Oram, a second-oldest of the Oram brothers (Matthew Oram, the son of their third brother, was their nephew). In late 1871, Ruddenklau was the founder of the German Benefit Association. The object of the association was for Germans to support each other during times of sickness or distress. With those objectives closely related to religion, is wasn't for long before it was proposed to build a church for German Protestants. Funds were raised by a committee presided by Ruddenklau, and in November 1872, the foundation stone of the German Church was laid. Ruddenklau travelled to Germany in February 1873 and among other duties, he found a pastor and arranged transport for the three bells that the church building committee had requested from the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. Ruddenklau returned with a pastor, Rev. L. Lohr, on the Rakaia in April 1874, and the church was formally opened on 14 May 1874. The bells arrived later that month, but a new bell tower had to be built, and it was not before Christmas Eve of 1874 that the bells were inaugurated. Political career Ruddenklau first stood for election for Christchurch City Council in January 1866; city councillors were elected for two-year terms at the time. Five people contested the four available positions, and Ruddenklau came fourth and was thus successful, just one vote ahead of the person who came last. 1866 proved to be one of the most difficult years for Christchurch City Council over its entire history. A ratepayer revolt nearly bankrupted the city council. Ruddenklau, during the 16 April weekly meeting, started the discussion on why the council was continuing to employ a labour force, and by the end of the meeting, councillors had resolved to lay of their labour staff. Later in the year, the city's drainage scheme was abandoned and the pipes, imported from London, sold off. As a consequence, Christchurch's reputation as the \\"most polluted and unhealthy city\\" in New Zealand was retained for another 20 years. In January 1868 when Ruddenklau's term came to an end, four positions on the city council had to be filled. Eight candidates stood for election, and the four retiring members were all re-elected. In addition, one councillor had resigned, and two candidates stood to replace him. On 15 January, a day after the nomination meeting, the poll was held between 10am and 4pm as one (i.e. covering both the retiring and the resigned positions). Ruddenklau came fourth and was thus successful. One of the defeated candidates was Michael Hart, who would later become mayor of Christchurch. A protest by one of the unsuccessful candidates that two separate polls should have been taken came to nothing. James Gapes announced on 25 November 1881 his candidacy for a third term as mayor, as he was not satisfied with the other two contenders for the position, the timber merchant Charles Benjamin Taylor, and Ruddenklau. However, on 28 November, Gapes advertised that he had withdrawn from the contest. The election was won by Ruddenklau on 30 November, possibly helped by the support of The Star just prior to the election. Ruddenklau was installed as the next mayor on 21 December 1881. The Ruddenklau family grave in Barbadoes Street Cemetery, with the headstone toppled in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake In September 1882, Ruddenklau received a deputation led by ex-mayor James Jameson, supported by ex-mayors Charles Thomas Ick and Fred Hobbs and many other influential citizens, urging him to stand for second term. Ruddenklau consented and two months later, he was returned elected unopposed. Ruddenklau decided to retire in 1883 after two terms as mayor. One of the last public duties carried out by Ruddenklau was to open the Armagh Street Bridge on 11 December 1883. Speeches at the opening were given by Mayor Ruddenklau, Mayor-elect Charles Hulbert, and senior councillor Aaron Ayers. Hulbert was installed as Ruddenklau's successor on 19 December 1883. The 1884 general election was contested by five candidates in the Stanmore electorate. The incumbent, Walter Pilliet, came a distant fourth place. Daniel Reese, Ruddenklau, Dorney, Pilliet and Wansey received 524, 435, 142, 43 and 19 votes, respectively. The majority for Reese was 89 votes. There was some protest about the election, but this came to nothing and the result stood as declared. Although his English was 'imperfect', Ruddenklau's speeches were described as \\"thoroughly good, pithy, and to the purpose.\\" He lacked \\"presence\\" at public occasions, but was a good and generous host. He was wealthy and did not have to run a business at the same time as fulfilling mayoral duties. Death and commemoration Ruddenklau's only child, Fanny Gertrude, died in October 1863 shortly before she turned nine. Ruddenklau died at his home in Addington on 15 December 1891, aged 62. He was buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. His wife died on 29 June 1918. As their only child died during childhood, there are no direct descendants. All Ruddenklaus in New Zealand are descended from his brother John. There is little that commemorates Ruddenklau today. Ruddenklau Lane in the Christchurch suburb of Bishopdale was created in a subdivision in the early 1980s and runs alongside the headwater of Dudley Creek. Ruddenklau's City Hotel was demolished in mid-1931, but the licence and the proprietor transferred to the New City Hotel further south on Colombo Street; this building is still standing and is a registered heritage structure. The German Church was confiscated in 1918 by the New Zealand Government and the church bells first ceremoniously smashed and then melted down in the aftermath of World War I when there were strong anti-German feelings in New Zealand. The church was demolished in 1933 and made way for a parish hall. The site of the Deutsche Kirche is today occupied by the Christchurch Art Gallery.

Their first performance was at the Hollybush Inn in Oxford on 21 October 2006, advertised as \\"Banjo Madness\\". By 2007 the band had begun to shift away from skiffle and more firmly towards blues and jazz. The instrumentation of the band began to reflect this change with the addition of bass and drums and a horn section. The band's repertoire is now made up exclusively of original compositions by Macbeth. In February 2009 the band played a gig at Oxford's Wheatsheaf pub which met with a favourable review in Oxford's Nightshift magazine. Oxford Music Scene described their performance at the OX4 Festival that summer as \\"completely brilliant\\" and \\"a breath of fresh air\\". They have played at Glastonbury Festival, The Royal Albert Hall, Ronnie Scotts, and the Royal Festival Hall and released a single on wax cylinder. One of the highlights of their schedule is their annual Christmas headline show at the O2 Academy in Oxford. Macbeth discussed the origin of the band's name in a 2009 interview: > \\"Many of our heroes, like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Louis Jordan, started > out with a black touring troupe called who used the Rabbit Foot in their > name. Spasm bands in New Orleans in the 1890s made music out of homemade > instruments, which is how we started out. The Original bit is just quite > funny, and a little homage to a whole host of early Jazz bands who stuck > that at the front of their name. Kid Creole had his Dr Buzzard's Original > Savannah Band as well, and he was about as original as we are.\\" The band released their first album Year of the Rabbit on 3 February 2011, which was described as \\"a damn addictive ride from start to finish...vivid, fun and full of life\\". Their second album Party Seven was released on 16 September 2013 on the Jump Steady label. As a warm up for the album the band kicked off 2013 by launching their own brand of cider.

Born in London and raised in San Diego, Ratajkowski first appeared on the cover of the March 2012 issue of the erotic magazine treats!, which led to her appearing in two music videos ‚Äì Robin Thicke‚Äôs \\"Blurred Lines\\" (the number-one song of 2013 in several countries) and Maroon 5's \\"Love Somebody\\". Ratajkowski appeared in the 2014 and 2015 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. She made her professional runway modeling debut for Marc Jacobs at New York Fashion Week in 2015 and has since walked on the Paris Fashion Week runway for Miu Miu and Milan Fashion Week for Bottega Veneta, Dolce & Gabbana, and Versace. Ratajkowski appeared in a Buick Super Bowl commercial during Super Bowl 50 (2016), and has become the spokesperson for brands such as DKNY, The Frye Company, Kerastase, Paco Rabanne, and DL1961. Ratajkowski began acting as a child in San Diego before she gained a recurring role on the Nickelodeon series iCarly (2009‚Äì2010). Her feature film debut was as the mistress of Ben Affleck's character in the 2014 film Gone Girl. Her other roles include the films Entourage (2015), We Are Your Friends (2015), I Feel Pretty (2018) and Welcome Home (2018), as well as the miniseries The Spoils Before Dying (2015) and the anthology series Easy (2016). Ratajkowski is an advocate for women's health issues as a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood. As a self-identified feminist, she has received both support and criticism for her views on sexual expression. Early life Emily O'Hara Ratajkowski was born on June 7, 1991, in Westminster, London, the only child of American parents, Kathleen Anne Balgley and John David \\"J.D.\\" Ratajkowski. Balgley, who earned her PhD from the University of California, San Diego, became a lecturer of English at the University of California, Los Angeles. She then taught American literature in Poland from September 1987 to July 1988, and again from September 1988 to July 1989, under the Fulbright Program. Balgley met Ratajkowski, a painter and art teacher, while they were both teaching at San Dieguito Academy in Encinitas, California. At the time of their daughter's birth, they were aged 39 and 45, respectively, and unmarried. Ratajkowski describes her mother as a \\"feminist and intellectual\\". The family lived in West Kensington and Bloomsbury before settling in San Diego, California, when Ratajkowski was five. She was raised primarily in nearby Encinitas. Balgley formerly taught at California Polytechnic State University, and , teaches at San Diego Jewish Academy. Ratajkowski is of English, Irish, Polish, German, and Jewish descent. Her father was raised Roman Catholic, whereas her mother was raised Jewish. Before Ratajkowski left London at the age of five, she was obsessed with theater. She began acting as a child, staging shows for her family. Her earliest role was as Elsa in the North Coast Repertory Theatre School's The Little Match Girl. In 2004, she played Harriet in the interactive Lyceum Theatre production of Harriet Potter and the Throne of Applewort. Ratajkowski tried soccer, acting, and ballet before modeling. Ratajkowski visited nude beaches in Europe with her family during her youth. Exposure to the nude female figure in photography and art during her formative years, including the work of her father, as well as the photography of Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts, prepared Ratajkowski for nude work. She has said, \\"We have this culture of men, especially, watching pornography, but then [they are] offended by a classic nude portrait or photograph, and I've never felt that way.\\" She was also influenced by third- wave feminism and works such as The Beauty Myth and Promiscuities by Naomi Wolf. Career alt=Black and white side-view photo of Caucasian brunette sitting completely nude with her knees tucked to her chest With encouragement from an acting coach, Ratajkowski met and signed with a talent agent who contacted Ford Models. That same day, she signed with Ford at age 14 and went on to do teen print catalog modeling for Kohl's and Nordstrom. At 15, Ratajkowski began auditioning for Disney and iCarly roles, but as she pursued acting she was often typecast as a bully or cheerleader, and decided to stop auditioning until she had garnered enough fame to be more selective about her roles. She attended San Dieguito Academy, a high school in San Diego, while modeling and acting in Los Angeles. After two nondescript movie roles, she appeared as Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009‚Äì2010). Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements until she could be more selective. Ratajkowski attended UCLA for one year in 2009, then decided to model full-time. She later said that she found the fine art education at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture arbitrary and in conflict with her artistic concepts, and that she did not enjoy socializing with fellow students. After campaigns and editorials with photographer Tony Duran, Ratajkowski began shooting more fashion editorials and posed for several early issues of the artistic erotica magazine treats!, including the cover of its third issue, in March 2012. She credits that cover for bringing her the two unsolicited, high-profile, music video roles. Ratajkowski later filmed commercials for Nikon and Carl's Jr., including multiple versions of a 2012 Carl's Jr. commercial with Sara Jean Underwood. She also did nude and clothed art modeling for magazines, including a May 2012 shoot with Jonathan Leder, as well as work for Frederick's of Hollywood; a 2012 holiday video and a 2011 Valentine's video in which Ratajkowski appeared for the company are among the most popular videos on the company's YouTube channel. Ratajkowski worked with photographer Tony Kelly for the March 2013 GQ Turkey cover. Music video performances Ratajkowski appeared in Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams's 2013 video, \\"Blurred Lines\\". Previously, Ratajkowski had been cast in two other music videos: \\"Fast Car\\" by Taio Cruz, which was released on November 5, 2012, and Maroon 5's \\"Love Somebody\\", which was released two months after \\"Blurred Lines\\". \\"Love Somebody\\", shot on January 16, and \\"Blurred Lines\\" were both produced in 2013. The video for \\"Love Somebody\\" was released on May 21, 2013. Directed by Rich Lee, it shows bare-chested Adam Levine using inverse green screen technology to rub paint onto Ratajkowski with his hands. As they touch, they reveal each other. Thicke had seen Ratajkowski's treats! cover that The New York Times Bee Shapiro described as \\"an artfully composed black-and-white photograph of Ms. Ratajkowski sitting completely nude with her knees tucked to her chest\\" and convinced director Diane Martel to cast her in the \\"Blurred Lines\\" music video. Martel felt that \\"she looked smart and stunningly beautiful\\" in the photo. Ratajkowski initially declined the role, fearing being classified as a music video model, but Martel persuaded her. The video was released on March 20, 2013. On March 28, Thicke posted an explicit version, with a topless Ratajkowski. \\"Blurred Lines\\" was controversial: its video was called sexist for its perceived degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape. Others disagreed, asserting that the lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: \\"it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing.\\" Ratajkowski did not think of the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, \\"took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting\\". She said that the song \\"gave me an opportunity to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture.\\" Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes. \\"Blurred Lines\\", and Ratajkowski's associated video performance, was prominent beyond the sociopolitical controversies. The song became the number-one song of 2013 on music charts in many countries, including Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Although second on the year-end US Billboard Hot 100 chart, the song's twelve consecutive weeks at number one made it the longest-running number-one song of the decade until \\"Uptown Funk\\" spent fourteen consecutive weeks at number one in 2015. The song also remained in the news due to a copyright infringement lawsuit and appeal. Breakthrough The \\"Blurred Lines\\" video garnered Ratajkowski notoriety, especially as a sex symbol. In October 2013, Esquire magazine named Ratajkowski \\"Woman of the Year\\", over online fan vote finalist Jennifer Lawrence. That December, Rolling Stone magazine listed her among its twenty hottest sex symbols. In February 2014, Sports Illustrated magazine named Ratajkowski as one of twelve 50th anniversary swimsuit issue rookies. In April, FHM ranked her the fourth sexiest woman in the world. Maxim magazine included Ratajkowski at number62 on its 2014 Hot 100 list. AskMen ranked her the third most desirable woman of 2014. Ratajkowski was on the July 2013 cover of CR Fashion Book, which included erotic scenes with Karlie Kloss and male models, photographed by Bruce Weber. On June 24, she appeared topless in the July 2014 American GQ cover story, photographed by Michael Thompson. A controversy ensued at retailer Lands' End, some of whose customers received the issue for free. Some customers objected to the racy images, forcing Lands' End CEO Edgar Huber to apologize. LOVE Advent 2014alt=Portrait of a brunette Caucasian with red lipstick from above Ratajkowski leveraged her sudden prominence into supporting roles in major films. Ratajkowski played Andie Fitzgerald, the mistress of Ben Affleck's character, in David Fincher's 2014 adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl. Affleck encouraged Fincher to consider Ratajkowski after seeing the \\"Blurred Lines\\" video. U-T San Diego described Ratajkowski's performance as \\"nuanced\\", while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon and Wesley Morris of Grantland wrote that her small role as a \\"duplicitous and manipulative former student\\" was critical. Reflecting on the performance in 2016, Wolf described Ratajkowski's portrayal as sympathetic and compassionate. Days after Gone Girl September 26, 2014, New York Film Festival premiere, Ratajkowski became the cover model for the November 2014 issue of Cosmopolitan. On October 30, 2014, she appeared with Taylor Kitsch in the Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare live-action trailer. Ratajkowski appeared on the February 2015 FHM cover, but she tweeted that her picture was used without her consent. FHM responded that \\"we liked the pictures so much we stuck one on our front cover\\". Ratajkowski co-starred in the 2015 film Entourage as a fictionalized version of herself, playing the love interest of Adrian Grenier's character, Vincent Chase. Her performance received critical commentary ranging from \\"less than compelling\\", by The Hollywood Reporter Sheri Linden, to \\"uncanny realism\\", by The Philadelphia Inquirer Steven Rea. Grantland Morris described her role and performance with scathing sarcasm. She was also cast in the 2015 miniseries The Spoils Before Dying as Agent Day, appearing late in the series. Her performance was favorably reviewed by Emily L. Stephens of The A.V. Club, while other critics commented that she was part of a solid supporting cast. Ratajkowski earned her first leading role, opposite Zac Efron, in We Are Your Friends, a musical drama released in August 2015, and was part of the film's promotional tour to Europe and North America. Starting with the August 11 London premiere, this tour marked her ascension as a style icon as she earned multiple best dressed citations from various sources. She played Stanford University dropout Sophie, the love interest of Efron's character and girlfriend/personal assistant of Wes Bentley's character. Her performance received mixed reviews. Alonso Duralde of TheWrap described the role as thin, as did Ty Burr of The Boston Globe. Burr said that Ratajkowski's performance was \\"surpassingly dull\\", while Nell Minow of Beliefnet stated that she \\"does more posing than acting\\". Kyle Smith of the New York Post described her performance as \\"quietly entrancing\\", and Jordan Hoffman of the Daily News described Ratajkowski's performance as \\"stunning and sweet\\". Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph and Grantland Morris noted Ratajkowski's rhythmic dancing skills and sex appeal, as previously seen in \\"Blurred Lines\\". Around the time of the release of We Are Your Friends, Ratajkowski appeared on the covers of Grazia France, British GQ, harper by Harper's Bazaar, InStyle UK, and InStyle Australia, as well as a role as a 2015 MTV Video Music Awards presenter. The British GQ cover story was photographed by Mario Testino, who produced a short film featuring Ratajkowski for the magazine's website. Soon after, on September 17, 2015, she made her runway debut for Marc Jacobs at the spring/summer 2016 New York Fashion Week finale. This appearance contributed to her number-one listing among Vogue 12 Breakout Beauty Stars of 2015. For fall/winter 2016 fashions, Ratajkowski walked the Paris Fashion Week runway for Miu Miu on March 9, 2016. She has expressed the desire to break barriers for shorter and more curvaceous models, commenting: \\"You don't have to be 5'9\\" and an A-cup to be a successful model.\\" Ratajkowski in 2016 A Buick Super Bowl ad for its Cascada convertible during Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016, featured Ratajkowski and Odell Beckham Jr. The ad, in which she made a wedding bouquet catch reminiscent of Beckham's catch from 2014, received average ratings, according to USA Today admeter. The ad was filmed with a stunt double making the catch. Los Angeles-based jewelry designer Jacquie Aiche featured Ratajkowski in a spring 2016 campaign wearing almost nothing but body chains, rings, bracelets, pendants, and chokers. In May, Ratajkowski appeared in the Russian-language music video \\"Inseparable\\" (sometimes translated as \\"Indivisible\\") with Russian entertainer Dima Bilan as a photographer and Ratajkowski as his muse. Ratajkowski was one of five models to appear on the August 2016 Vogue Germany alternate covers along with Stella Maxwell, Irina Shayk, Lily Aldridge, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Along with Joan Smalls and Kate Upton, Ratajkowski was one of three models for the October Glamour cover. The cover story, which was shot by Carter Smith and includes an essay by Ratajkowski, says she has become known as an activist who considers being both sexual and serious to be non-conflicting ambitions. She appeared in a season 1 episode of Joe Swanberg's Netflix series, Easy that was released on September 22, 2016. Her episode, in which she is a lifecasting selfie artist, met with mixed reviews. She was a guest judge on the October 20, Project Runway season 15 episode. By November 2016, Ratajkowski was attached to Lying and Stealing, which also starred Theo James. Ratajkowski began 2017 on the February Vogue Espa√±a cover shot by Miguel Reveriego. Ratajkowski also made cover appearances on the March issue of U.S. InStyle, and the May covers of American Marie Claire (with alternate covers by Janelle Mon√°e, Aja Naomi King, Zoey Deutch, Alexandra Daddario, et al.) and the French L'Officiel. In 2017, Ratajkowski promoted Fyre Festival on Instagram with Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and other actresses/models. Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model to use the hashtag #ad, but has since deleted the post. The Federal Trade Commission has said #ad only worked if at the beginning of paid posts, and that the hashtag alone was not a sufficient disclaimer. A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles was filed. The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud. On June 27. she was announced as the cover model for the August 2017 Australian Harper's Bazaar, which had different newsstand and subscriber covers photographed by Pamela Hanson. Bags designed by Ratajkowski for The Kooples on display at Bloomingdale's at 900 North Michigan In July 2017 after modelling for the French fashion brand The Kooples's Fall 2017 collection, Ratajkowski was enlisted to design a 38-piece bag collection for the company.

The bags are Italian-made and represent The Kooples' first foray into bags. Later that month she was announced as the feature of cover stories in the August issues of Allure and British Glamour as well as a nude Patrick Demarchelier photospread for Love magazine. Ratajkowski played Jessica Weintraub, the female lead opposite Spencer Boldman in the film Cruise, which was written and directed by Robert Siegel. She was hired as part of the cast of the film In Darkness, alongside Natalie Dormer, Ed Skrein, and Stacy Martin. Ratajkowski had a role opposite Aaron Paul in Welcome Home. On September 23, she walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Bottega Veneta. Later that month, Ratajkowski revealed that she was working with a dialogue coach to learn the French and Italian languages for Lying and Stealing. On November 1, Tyga posted an unofficial 60-second video teaser for \\"Tequilla Kisses\\", which featured Ratajkowski. As a result, Ratajkowski was noted as the starring performer in Tyga's \\"Tequilla Kisses\\" bonus track music video. However, on November 4, Tyga removed the full video from various points of internet access including his own Instagram account, following complaints from Ratajkowski that the video was from a lookbook Ratajkowski did with Phillip Lopez in 2013. On November 9, Harper's Bazaar UK published a story about Ratajkowski's impending release of her own swimwear brand after Emrata Holdings LLC acquired the trademark to Inamorata in August and she left a trail of breadcrumbs on social media. Ratajkowski retweeted the story. The bathing suit line, Inamorata, went live on November 16, 2017 with three bikini separates and three one-pieces. Ratajkowski co-starred alongside Amy Schumer in the 2018 comedy film I Feel Pretty.

On September 21, 2018, Ratajkowski walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Versace. That same weekend, she walked fashion week for Dolce & Gabbana. Media image Ratajkowski has been frequently named in lists and polls that rank beauty or fashion in the media. She was ranked in Maxim Hot 100 list in both 2014 (No. 62) and 2015 (No. 2). AskMen ranked her among its most desirable women of 2014 (No. 3) and 2016 (No. 14); while FHM ranked her among the sexiest in 2014 (No. 4), and 2015 (No. 18). She is also praised for her fashion sense: Ratajkowski made Vogue Italia's Best Dressed List of 2015, and Harper's Bazaar placed her atop its best dressed list at the February 2016 New York Fashion Week. In their respective reviews of We Are Your Friends, Richard Roeper and Wesley Morris said that Ratajkowski, again playing the attractive object of affection, again failed to demonstrate acting prowess. Ratajkowski described the pressure that she endured as a youth around her sexuality and her thoughts on female sexual empowerment, in Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter newsletter on February 16, 2016. Elle magazine, Esquire magazine, and Harper's Bazaar republished her letter. Critics, including Glamour magazine's Hayley Spencer, The Huffington Post Jenavieve Hatch, and Rachael Moon of the Daily Mirror, praised it. According to Cosmopolitan magazine's Nikki Kinstlinger and Georgia Simmonds of Marie Claire, Ratajkowski finds self-empowerment in defining and owning the expression of her sexuality and body. Salon Erin Coulehan described the essay's identification of a societal catch-22, in which showcasing female sexuality that may \\"offend, excite, or create envy\\" leads to criticism and body shaming. InStyle Isabella Silvers concurred that \\"female sexuality isn't always for the benefit of someone else\\". Charlotte Gill of The Independent admitted that she was in the minority in finding the letter \\"rambling\\" and \\"dull\\". Ratajkowski defended Kim Kardashian from criticism when Kardashian posted a controversial naked selfie on Instagram in March 2016, saying that women have the right to \\"express their sexuality and share their bodies however they choose\\". Then, Kardashian and Ratajkowski jointly advocated via social media for female sexual empowerment and against body shaming; nearly one million social media followers responded positively, and prominent global media outlets took notice. Following her letter and social media statement, the controversy about her feminism heightened. Piers Morgan stated that Ratajkowski's form of feminism was a misguided affront to true feminism, labeling it pseudo-feminist gibberish. After Morgan wrote that \\"feminism as it was intended is dead\\", the Chicago Tribune Heidi Stevens, as well as The Daily Telegraph Helen Pankhurst (Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter) said that Ratajkowski neither killed nor bolstered feminism. Women's Wear Daily Taylor Harris questioned the impact of Ratajkowski's feminism. The Independent Gill questioned Ratajkowski's feminism, saying that her professional activities \\"continued to advocate industries that treat us as pieces of meat\\". Heather Saul of The Independent wrote in support of Ratajkowski in an article subtitled \\"Ratajkowski is becoming an important feminist voice in the debate over female censorship and sexuality\\". New York Allie Jones called Ratajkowski \\"the best feminist celeb\\". In August 2016, Ratajkowski became the spokesperson for the Australian swimwear brand Amore + Sorvete. In March 2017, she became the face of DKNY intimates. In August she became the face of DL1961 jeans. In August 2017, Ratajkowski became the face of The Frye Company for its Fall 2017 ad campaign. That August, she became the face of the entire DKNY brand for its fall 2017 campaign. According to a November 26, 2016, story on Page Six of the New York Post, 71 photographs taken by Leder in May 2012 were being printed in a publication by Imperial Publishing and set for display in a New York art gallery in February 2017. On November 30, 2016, Ratajkowski tweeted that she was being featured in the photobook publication without her consent. New York noted that Ratajkowski had claimed that the pictures were intended for use in an artful magazine, while USA Today noted that she had hesitated to protest because she did not want to give Leder publicity. She elaborated on the circumstances of the 2012 photoshoot in an essay for New York in September 2020, reiterating that she never gave consent for the photographs to be used beyond their initial publication in Darius magazine, and alleging that Leder sexually assaulted her after the photoshoot. In September 2017, Ratajkowski took issue with image editing done for the cover of the Madame Figaro issue included in the Saturday September 16 issue Le Figaro. American Vogue ran a feature article the following month for her \\"stylistic excellence\\". In January 2018, Ratajkowski shot a fashion campaign with Inez and Vinoodh, as the new ambassador for K√©rastase. British Vogue noted that the K√©rastase endorsement was Ratajkowski's \\"first beauty campaign\\". Then in March 2018, she landed her first fragrance campaign as the face of Paco Rabanne Parfum's women's line. She also earned the University of Southern California Inspire Award in at their inaugural ceremony in March 2018. On April 8, 2018, Ratajkowski won the Model of the Year award from the Daily Front Row. Personal life In September 2014, Ratajkowski was a victim in a female celebrity hacking and internet posting wave of stolen nude iCloud photographs. In December 2014, Us Weekly confirmed she had begun dating musician Jeff Magid. By early 2018, they had reportedly broken up. On February 23, 2018, Ratajkowski announced on Instagram that she had married actor and producer Sebastian Bear-McClard, her boyfriend of several weeks, in a surprise New York City courthouse wedding. Ratajkowski has raised funds, done public service announcements, and committed to a short film promoting reproductive and sexual health for Planned Parenthood. Ratajkowski says she enjoys freedom of sexual expression \\"while still being a feminist\\", and is outspoken about using her celebrity to support the empowerment of women and women's sexuality. Amanda Hess of Slate questioned whether she is a feminist or an opportunist exploiting feminism. On the eve of the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski spoke at a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign. One of the main points of her speech, and her social media activity surrounding it, was to counter Gloria Steinem's statement that young female Sanders supporters were involved in the campaign to meet potential male romantic partners. In 2020, she endorsed Sanders once again for the Democratic nomination.

X-Moto is a free and open source 2D motocross platform game developed for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, where physics play an all important role in the gameplay. The basic gameplay clones that of Elasto Mania, but the simulated physics are subtly different.  Gameplay  In , a player selects a level and tries to collect the strawberries. Strawberries are required to complete a level, along with touching a flower. Obstacles to this goal are challenging terrain features and \\"wrecker\\" objects which should not be touched; in most levels there are no moving objects (only scripted or physics levels may have them). Also, these can be changed in some levels. The driver is not harmed directly by falling, only by hitting his head on rock or hitting any part of his body or the bike on a wrecker object. If this happens the level is lost (as of version 0.5.3 levels can feature check points). It is possible to save a replay, and to show a previous replay (\\"ghost driver\\") in parallel to gameplay. The game is extensible with over 2500 user-created custom levels that can be automatically downloaded. These are created using Inkscape with the Inksmoto extension.X-Moto Wiki: How to create smooth levels using Inkscape  Development  Level creation for X-Moto with Inkscape The project was started in 2005 on a sourceforge.net repository.According to the SourceForge project page (2005-05-26) The game was developed completely 2D, but utilizing 3D hardware acceleration (OpenGL) for faster rendering. An optional non-OpenGL ultra low requirements vector wireframe render mode is available that should run on any legacy platform. Graphics are kept simple, sound is sparse. The game features only engine sounds, level lost/won sounds, and a strawberry pickup sound, while the main menu features a single soundtrack. Levels can feature their own music. The game uses the Open Dynamics Engine for physical simulation. Moving objects, variable gravity and other features can be provided by scripting the levels using the Lua programming language. As of version 0.5.0, integration with the Chipmunk physics engine enables levels with multi-body dynamics.

Teeworlds is a free, open-source sidescrolling multiplayer shooting game originally created by Swedish developer Magnus Auvinen and now maintained by the community. It features simple cartoon-themed graphics and physics and relies heavily on classic shooter weaponry and gameplay. Currently there are official versions for Microsoft Windows, Linux, macOS and it has been available via digital distributor Steam since 2015. The source code is publicly available on github.  Gameplay  Teeworlds presents itself as a crossover between classic sprite-based shoot-em-up games of the arcade era and modern-day first-person shooters. It is played on two-dimensional, side-scrolling maps typical of the platformer genre, but uses FPS-style keyboard controls for moving, switching weapons and chatting. The game also sports a grappling hook and double jump mechanics for maneuvering. Grappling hooks can also be used to hook on other tees and pull them towards the player. Maps' landscape themes include: grass, cave, winter, desert, and jungle, which feature map elements such as spikes, pitfalls, and non-hook-able metal and rock in vanilla gametypes. Teeworlds works as a client-server system and the player can choose from a list of available game servers for multiplayer gaming. The player maneuvers a \\"Tee\\", a ball-shaped 2D character, using the keyboard and aims and shoots at other players or objects using the mouse. Health and shields (acting as armor) are spread out along the map, which can be collected by players when needed. The only powerup in the game is a katana, which gives the player a better damage dealing and quickness for a short period of time. It changes the player's character to a ninja, enabling other players to notice he picked up the powerup. There are weapons inspired by FPS games such as the Quake and Unreal series. Advanced weapons, such as the grenade-launcher, shotgun and laser, deal more damage than both the spawn weapons (Pistol) but only have limited ammunition. The grenade launcher is a powerful weapon with a quirk that allows players to shoot themselves up walls or higher in the air, enabling them to reach higher points in maps quicker, while harming the player himself.  Gametypes  Currently, the official vanilla gametypes are: * Deathmatch: The aim is to kill as many enemy players as possible, until a certain score is reached or the time runs out. * Team Deathmatch: The same gametype as Deathmatch, except that the players now fight in 2 teams and aim for a higher, combined kill score. * Capture The Flag: Two teams try to capture and score the enemy flag to reach a certain score (combined with team kills), or to have the higher score when the time runs out. There are also unofficial game types. * DDrace: Teams of tees complete maps, or races, together in order to climb up the leaderboard. * FNG: Tees use lasers to freeze other tees so they cannot move, then proceedingly kill the frozen tee by throwing it into spikes using the grappling hook and hammer. * infClass: Like the game \\"Infection\\", two \\"Tees\\" are selected to be zombies, and their objective is to infect all the remaining players, each with a special class, using their hammer and hook. (currently not active as of October 2020) There are many more unofficial gamemodes, but too many to list here. History  In December 2007, the source code was made available to the public under the terms of a Zlib like license. In March 2008 with the 0.4.0 release, the original name \\"Teewars\\" was changed to Teeworlds by the developers due to legal reasons.

Development  Because Teeworlds is open-source, a community actively develops it, using GitHub with the main developer known as Oy. Teeworlds is mainly programmed in the programming languages C and C++.  Code modifications  As Teeworlds source code is being public, many fan programmers can create their own versions of the game (\\"forks\\"), which generally has a strong influence on the game and its further development. Many players are attracted to the endless possibilities of changing the game to suit their own benefits. Slightly modified game servers are accepted by the official game, as long as they broadcast that they are. Most of the modified server versions feature new gametypes. Modified game clients are commonly used by the community.  User- created content  The game includes a map editor, which is a simple tool to create own maps with. Many user created maps include their own tilesets that are downloaded with the maps from the game server Teeworlds uses simple image files for most of the games's graphical content. As a result, this content may be modified and extended. Customized game character skins can be seen by other clients, as long as the skins have the same name. Teeworlds can take screenshots and record demos that can then be viewed in the game. This has led to many Teeworlds videos on web platforms, such as YouTube.

Background When the band's second album, Wake Up...It's Tomorrow, failed to recapture the huge success of 1967's Incense and Peppermints, the band's management decided to exert more control over the recordings for the third album.The World in a Sea Shell liner notes Richie Unterberger To this end, they pressured the band to record several compositions written by outsiders, including Carole King and \\"Incense and Peppermints\\" lyricists John Carter and Tim Gilbert. The band members bristled at this situation, but reluctantly agreed to it in the end. Thus, five of the album's 12 songs (including most of side 1 of the vinyl LP) were non-SAC songs. The new direction did not pay off commercially for the band. Many of the tracks on The World in a Sea Shell featured lush orchestration and a gentle, escapist feel that stood in stark contrast to the adventurous psychedelia of the band's past work. This sudden change in direction, seen as a gross miscalculation on their managers' part by the band members, helped seal Strawberry Alarm Clock's fate. This frustrated the band, as their own compositions for this album included some adventurous moments and sound collages that fans might have expected and that weren't too far removed from the style of the previous albums.

He served as the first pastor of St. Anthony's Church in Davenport, Iowa from 1839 to 1868. Early life and ministry Pelamourgues was born in the city of Graissac, in the Department of Aveyron, France. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Rodez. After Bishop Mathias Loras was consecrated as the first bishop of Dubuque in Mobile, Alabama in 1837 he set sail for Europe to recruit priests for his new diocese. While in France he recruited two priests, Joseph Cr√©tin and Pelamourgues, as well as four seminarians: Augustin Ravoux, Lucien Galtier, James Causse, and Remigius Petiot. They made a difficult voyage of 54 days across the Atlantic Ocean in the Autumn of 1838. They attributed their safe passage to the intercession of St. Cessianus, whose relics had been given to Loras by Pope Gregory XVI while he was in Rome. The priests had celebrated Mass at an altar constructed over the relics.Kempker, J.F. \\"Very Rev. J. A. M. Pelamourgues, Missionary priest and educator. Distinguished in the annals of the Roman Catholic Church of early Iowa\\" The Annals of Iowa, A Historical Quarterly. Vol. 6, 3rd series, Charles Aldrich, editor. (Des Moines: Historical Department of Iowa, 1903) 117 The saint's relics are now under the altar in St. Raphael's Cathedral in Dubuque. After they landed in New York, Pelamourgues and the seminarians went to St. Mary's Seminary at Baltimore to learn English, while Loras and Cr√©tin proceeded to St. Louis to wait out the winter. In the spring the Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP, the only priest serving the Dubuque Diocese, traveled to St. Louis and escorted Loras and the others to Dubuque. Pastor in Davenport Bishop Loras went to Davenport, Iowa to make a pastoral visit and to dedicate St. Anthony's Church on May 23, 1839. While he was there the parishioners pleaded with the bishop for a parish priest. In July of the same year the bishop made a pastoral visit to the area around Fort Snelling in present-day St. Paul, Minnesota. Father Pelamourgues accompanied him on the journey. On the way back to Dubuque they visited the villages of the Sioux tribes along the way. Pelamourgues stayed in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin for a month before he was recalled.Schmidt, 39 Undated photo of the original St. Anthony's Church built in 1838. In September 1839 Father Pelamourgues was assigned the first pastor of St. Anthony's Church in Davenport. Until 1846 he also regularly visited Muscatine, Burlington, Iowa City, Columbus Junction, DeWitt and Lyons, which is the north side of present-day Clinton. He also took pastoral responsibility for the people in Stephenson, Illinois, which was across the Mississippi River from Davenport. The town is now the city of Rock Island. Bishop Loras desired the conversion of the Native American peoples of his diocese to Christianity. He gave various priests the pastoral responsibility for a particular tribe. Father Pelamourgues was given the care of the Sac (or Sauk) and Fox tribes. Father Pelamourgues was not successful in this part of his mission. However, there is one story that illustrates that his failure was not from want of trying. When he was visiting Burlington, he was told of a Native American in Agency City. He immediately set out to attend the dying man but was stopped by a guard who informed him that if he entered the tribe's reservation he would be imprisoned. Father Pelamourgues determined that his responsibility was to the dying man and so he continued on. He was taken prisoner for two or three days until General Joseph M. Street returned. Davenport had a small French community and a larger, and growing, Irish community. Pelamourgues was aware that his ability to speak English was minimal at best, and so he studied so as to be able to both read and speak English fluently. When German immigrants started moving to Davenport he started to learn that language as well. He also taught English to other new priests to the diocese.Schmidt. 45 When Pelamourgues first arrived at St. Anthony's, the church building was used for various community functions as it was the largest structure in the small town. He resided in the gallery of the church, which was separated from the rest of the space by rough boards. Eventually a residence was created for him on the main floor of the building. As soon as Father Pelamourgues arrived in Davenport he started a school at St. Anthony's, and he served as its first teacher. It was the one of the first schools established in the small town.Schmidt, 54 Classes were taught in the church proper itself with a curtain pulled across the altar area. He had an addition built onto the building in 1843, and he convinced the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary to open a school in Davenport. Financial difficulties forced the sisters to leave after a year. They returned in 1855 to teach the girls at St. Anthony's. Immaculate Conception Academy opened four years later. Pelamourgues also desired brothers to teach the boys, but declined Bishop Loras' offer to send French Brothers. He said a French pastor was all an Irish community could handle.Schmidt, 56 He continued to teach the boys. He was known as a strict disciplinarian, and believed it was important to teach his students a trade. His most prominent pupil was John Forrest Dillon who would go to become the chief justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, and a United States District Court judge appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant. The stone church built by Fr. Pelamourgues in the 1850s. On the right through the trees can be seen the addition added in 1883. In 1850 Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of St. Paul, and Father Cr√©tin was appointed as its first bishop. Pelamourgues was assigned by Bishop Loras to replace Cr√©tin as vicar general of the Diocese of Dubuque. After Bishop Cr√©tin's death seven years later, Father Pelamourgues was chosen to succeed him in St. Paul. Pelamourgues was dismayed by the appointment and when he received his letter of appointment he responded to the Holy See with a letter declining the office. His reasons were accepted and Pelamourgues remained in Davenport. In 1865 when Loras' successor, Bishop Clement Smyth, died, Pelamourgues served as administrator of the Dubuque Diocese. He was on the list of names that was sent to the Holy See to replace Smyth.Schmidt, 96 Father Pelamourgues was also an early promoter of Davenport being named a see city when the question arose concerning the division of the Dubuque Diocese.Schmidt, 103. In 1850 plans were being drawn up to construct a new church at St. Anthony's. It was a simple structure built of stone in the Greek Revival style. The building was 84 by 44 feet and completed in 1853. St. Anthony's was never a wealthy community in the years that Pelamourgues was pastor,History of Davenport and Scott Co and so it took time to carry out the building project. Pelamourgues himself left Davenport and traveled to his native France in 1852 to visit his ailing father. As Davenport continued to grow so did St. Anthony's, and there were needs that Father Pelamourgues could not accomplish on his own. German immigrants began to settle in Davenport, and so he helped to establish St. Kunigunda parish to serve their pastoral needs in 1855. The following year he and Antoine LeClaire were instrumental in establishing St. Margaret's on the bluff to the east of downtown, and St. Anthony's lost its long-time parishioner and benefactor. While he helped establish St. Kunigunda he was opposed to a church that was only for German-speaking people. When the German pastor, Rev. Michael Flammang, refused to serve the needs of the Irish who settled in the west end, Pelamourgues threatened to build a new church under his nose. In 1867 Pelamourgues established St. Mary's parish on the Catholic cemetery property in the west end, two blocks from St. Kunigunda. He served both St. Anthony's and St. Mary's as pastor until a resident pastor was assigned to St. Mary's in 1868. Later life In 1868 Pelamourgues visited his native France, but circumstances arose that prevented his return to Davenport. He was involved in establishing one more institution in the city, however. In 1869 Mother Mary Borromeo Johnson of the Sisters of Mercy came to Davenport raising money for a new school in DeWitt. She saw the conditions at the county poorhouse, and was asked to take over care of the sick and poor. Through his attorney, Father Pelamourgues assisted Mother Borromeo in acquiring the property where the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary had initially established a girls' school at the end of Marquette Street for Mercy Hospital. Pelamourgues lived out his remaining days in Sainte-Genevi√®ve- sur-Argence and died there in 1875.

The school had an Honors program, and school musicals. The Physical Education program had racquetball, tennis, and basketball equipment & facilities, as well as a workout room, and video game systems with sports-related games (i.e., Wii Fit, Just Dance, and Dance Dance Revolution). Students could eat lunch inside the cafeteria or outside in a commons area, and students who buy school lunches had a range of \\"stations\\" to choose from (i.e., Pizza Station, Sub Station, Fiesta Station). At the start of the school year in 2016, Brockbank Jr. High became a part of Cyprus High School's campus; and 7th to 8th graders attended Matheson Jr. High. History On July 24, 1947, while most people in Magna were celebrating the 100 year anniversary of the arrival of the Latter-day Saint Pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley, some boys were playing with some firecrackers in a field near Cyprus High School. Sparks went astray, and before they knew it, the 7-8 grade wing of the high school caught fire. Fire crews fought hard, but they could not save that portion of the high school. District officials decided it was time to build a separate building for the junior high school students to attend, and thus construction began on a new building directly east of the high school. End of an era May 27, 2016 was a somber day for many students, staff members and alumni of Brockbank Junior High School. The end of the school year also meant the end of Brockbank as a junior high school. The buildings have been transformed and now serve as a ninth and tenth grade core subject extension of the Cyprus High School campus.

It was entered into the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival where Alberto Sordi won the Silver Bear for Best Actor award. Plot Roman surveyor Giuseppe Di Noi, who has lived in Sweden for many years and married a Swedish woman and respected professional, decides to take his family on holiday in Italy. At the Italian border he is stopped and arrested without any explanation. After three days in jail in Milan, he learns - through the efforts of a guard - that he has been charged with \\"manslaughter\\" of a German citizen. Giuseppe is deemed a \\"fugitive\\" and thus ineligible for house arrest; he is instead transferred from prison to prison until he reaches the imaginary town of Sagunto (near Salerno), where he gets placed in solitary confinement. Di Noi undergoes a genuine judicial ordeal, full of humiliations. He iss unwillingly involved in a riot, and as a result is transferred to a prison for inmates serving life sentences, and ultimately to a psychiatric facility. It takes the obstinacy of his wife, the passionate interest of his lawyer and the benevolence of the investigating magistrate otherwise on vacation, to arrive at a logical explanation. While recovered at the hospital, Di Noi's lawyer learns about a highway viaduct Battipaglia-Matera - built years before by an Italian firm where he was employed as a surveyor - which collapsed and caused the death of a German driver in transit. The protagonist had subsequently moved to Sweden. Lacking international communications, he could not be notified a subpoena, and therefore technically became a fugitive. Even after regaining his freedom, Di Noi remains irrevocably marked by the ordeal, both physically and psychologically.

As a child she acted in West End plays, and became a close friend, confidante, and collaborator of No√´l Coward. She left the stage in 1920 and wrote a series of novels. A growing interest in religious and moral matters led her into non-fiction and journalism, sometimes in partnership with the writer J. D. Beresford. Biography=Early years Dorothy Estelle Esm√© Innes Ripper was born in Stockwell, London, the only child of Harry Innes Ripper (1871‚Äì1956), a stockbroker, and Minnie Maude n√©e Pitt (1874‚Äì1940).Hoare, Philip. \\"Tyson, (Dorothy Estelle) Esm√© Wynne- (1898‚Äì1972)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 16 March 2010 (subscription site) Educated first by governesses, then at an English boarding school and at a Belgian convent, she became a child-actress, taking the stage name Esm√© Wynne in 1909.\\"Wynne-Tyson, Dorothy Estelle Esm√©\\". Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008, accessed 16 March 2010 (subscription site) She made her professional d√©but in Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird and was the original Rosamund in Where the Rainbow Ends in 1911. While in the latter play, she became friendly with the young No√´l Coward, who was in the production, and their friendship was for a time the most important in Coward's life. She began writing plays, sometimes alone and on other occasions in collaboration with Coward. Her first play, The Prince's Bride, was produced by Charles Hawtrey at the Savoy Theatre, London, when she was 13. Coward was in the cast. At the age of 19, she wrote a light comedy, Little Lovers, which was staged in London in 1922, drawing a dismissive review in The Times.The Times, 23 October 1922, p. 12. The ODNB states that Little Lovers was written jointly with Coward, but he was not credited in the Times notice or in Wynne-Tyson's Who's Who article. With Coward, she wrote a series of short plays, under the joint pen-name \\"Esnomel\\": The Last Chapter (staged 1917), To Have and to Hold (not staged), and Women and Whisky (staged 1918). Her last stage appearance was as Faith in Coward's comedy I'll Leave It to You, in 1920, to which she contributed lyrics for a song. Writing career In 1918 Wynne married Linden Charles Tyson, an officer in the Royal Air Force.Who's Who spells Tyson's first name as \\"Lynden\\", but the ODNB and The Times spell the name as given above. They combined their names as \\"Wynne- Tyson\\" the following year. There was one son of the marriage, Jon Wynne-Tyson, who became a writer and publisher. She became a convert to Christian Science and vegetarianism and was estranged from the worldly life of the theatre, though she remained friendly with Coward, who was amused at her attempts to improve his moral character. He teased her by professing \\"a selfless absorption in the well-being and achievement of No√´l Coward\\" and an \\"unregenerate spiritual attitude\\".Coward, p. 194 In the years after her marriage, Wynne-Tyson wrote a series of novels: Security, 1927; Quicksand, 1927; Momus, 1928; Melody, 1929; and Incense and Sweet Cane, 1930.\\"Esme Wynne- Tyson\\". Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2002, accessed 16 March 2010 (subscription site) All five of these novels were to some extent autobiographical, reflecting the deterioration of her marriage and her increasing attachment to religion. Her husband left her in 1930, and they were divorced in 1947. After the separation, she turned to non-fiction and journalism as well as fiction, often in collaboration with John Davys Beresford, who shared her interest in metaphysics and in a mutual gospel she later named \\"philosophy of compassion\\". They wrote ten novels together, although some were issued under Beresford's name, for contractual reasons. Their official collaborations were Strange Rival, 1940; Men in the Same Boat, 1943; The Riddle of the Tower, 1944; and The Gift, 1947. Wynne-Tyson's non- fiction works include Prelude to Peace: The World-Brotherhood Educational Movement, 1936; The Unity of Being, 1949; This Is Life Eternal: The Case for Immortality, 1951; (under the pseudonym Peter de Morny) The Best Years of Their Lives, 1955; Mithras, the Fellow in the Cap, 1958; The Philosophy of Compassion: The Return of the Goddess, 1962; and (as editor) Porphyry's Abstinence from Animal Food, 1965. Wynne-Tyson also wrote children's stories under the pen-name Amanda, and contributed philosophical articles, sometimes using the pen-name Diotima, to a wide range of publications including The Manchester Guardian and the Gandhian journal Gandhi Marg.Advertisement for October 1961 issue of Gandhi Marg lists Wynne-Tyson as one of the contributors. See New Politics magazine, March 1962, (p. 141). From 1961 to 1970 she edited the magazine World Forum, which focused on vegetarianism and humanitarian matters.\\"History of Vegetarianism\\". International Vegetarian Union, accessed 16 March 2010 Inspiration for stage characters Wynne- Tyson was the inspiration for several stage characters. Some critics have seen elements of her in Madame Arcati, the eccentric spiritualist in Coward's Blithe Spirit, though the chief source of the character is thought to be another of Coward's friends, the writer Clemence Dane.Hoare, p. 305 However, Carlotta in Coward's late play A Song at Twilight was based on Wynne-Tyson after she had briefly come back into Coward's life in 1952,Hoare, p. 394 and Amanda's cries of \\"sollocks\\" in Private Lives to restore peace at times of quarrel have their origins in Wynne-Tyson's youthful rules of engagement with Coward.Lesley, pp. 31‚Äì32 Her son Jon wrote a comedy, Marvellous Party, about a middle-age reunion of his mother and Coward.The play was published in 1989 () and broadcast by the BBC World Service in May 1994, with Stanley Baxter as Coward and Dorothy Tutin as Esm√©.

The following year, the couple moved to New York City where Floyd, dividing his time between advertising and magazine illustration, soon became the top man in both fields. Then, art editors had to compete with art directors of advertising agencies for his drawings.Watson, Ernest, Floyd Davis ‚Äì An American Illustrator of Great Originality, American Artist, January 1942, Vol. 6 Num 1, Published by Watson-Guptill Publications, PA, 1942 He became an accomplished illustrator for magazines like Woman's Home Companion, American Magazine, and a long run at the Saturday Evening Post. He did advertisements for most of the major ad firms with clients like Texaco, Johnnie Walker, Eveready, Desoto, Real Silk, Nabisco, Grape Nuts, Caterpillar Inc. and Hiram Walker. Floyd & Gladys moved to New York City and set up house-keeping in the old Sherwood Studios. On December 15, 1928 and February 1, 1930 respectively, Noel Montgomery Davis and Deborah Davis, their son and daughter made their appearance. In 1932 (at the height of the Great Depression), they decided to go abroad for a year to Cannes, France near a Renoir enclave.Davis, Gladys Rockmore, Gladys Rockmore Davis, Published by the American Artist Group Inc., New York, NY, 1945 ISBN B000H261KY In the thirties, Davis began to illustrate stories of humbler subjects. His pictures of southern rural and hill people for such authors as William Faulkner, Sigman Byrd, Glenn Allan, and MacKinlay Kantor became immensely popular. He loved these assignments and filled the pictures not only with a fascinating cast of individuals, but added the special Davis touches: a cat crouched in the corner ready to leap out at a rival, a fly on an old mans heat, a small lizard hiding behind a tree. None of these details intruded on the picture story itself they are there for the perceptive viewer to discover. Readers responded enthusiastically; his pictures were admired as much as the stories themselves.Reed, Walt & Roger, \\"The Illustrator in America, 1880‚Äì1980\\", A Century of Illustration, Published by Watson-Guptill Publications, PA, 2002 also American Art Archives, web site, http://www.americanartarchives.com/davis,floyd.htm The family moved in a social milieu which included luminaries in all the arts such as Ernest Hemingway, Dr. Thomas Mann, George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, and the puppeteer Bil Baird. They lived at 1 West 67th Street, known as the Hotel Des Artistes, later home of the famous Caf√© des Artistes, where other artists such as Stuart Davis, Leopold Seyffert and Leroy Neiman resided.Feigenbaum, Gail, Noel Rockmore ‚Äì Fantasies and Realities, Published by the New Orleans Museum of Art, 1998, World War II artist (1942‚Äì1945) At the start of 1942, Floyd Davis was featured in the January edition of American Artist. In 1942, Life Magazine sent Floyd Davis to Bermuda as a war correspondent to cover preparations for World War II. He completed nine paintings, one of which was used for the double page spread at the center of the magazine.Life Magazine, Bermuda ‚Äì Floyd Davis paints US forces on Hospitable Isle, Pg. 90, Published by Time Inc., Chicago, IL, Vol. 13, No. 12, September 21, 1942 In 1943, Life called Floyd Davis the \\"#1 illustrator in America\\".Life Magazine, Gladys Rockmore Davis, Pg. 44, Published by Time Inc., Chicago, IL, Vol. 14, No. 16, April 19, 1943 In 1942, Davis was sent by Life Magazine to England to cover the war. When he arrived at the American Eighth Air Force Bomber Command Post he found the troops engaged in preparations for a raid on Hamburg. The World War I veteran received permission from Life Magazine and the Defense Department to fly in the raid as a war correspondent. On the morning of July 25, 1943 Floyd Davis flew in the Raid on Hamburg and painted the raid from the sky. It became one of his most famous paintings.New York Times, October 27, 1966 Floyd Davis, obituary In 1943, Floyd Davis covered the War from England and was able to capture the English people as they lived throughout the siege. His most famous painting of Bob Hope entertaining the troops came from that assignment and still hangs at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.Life Magazine, England at War, Pg. 64‚Äì68, Published by Time Inc., Chicago, IL, Vol. 16, No. 14, April 3, 1944 Floyd Davis and his wife, Gladys Rockmore Davis were commissioned by Life Magazine to paint liberated Paris in 1944 and 1945 where Gladys narrowly escaped death in a German strafing of Metz. They were the first husband and wife correspondent team ever assigned to cover a War together. Floyd Davis concentrated on the wartime city with American soldiers, while she painted the familiar and nostalgic scenes. A show of their paintings was exhibited in the foyer of the Time-Life Building in 1945. During their time of covering the war, they became friends with the rest of the correspondents who hung out at The Hotel Scribe Barroom. Floyd depicted the entire group as part of a double page spread in the 1945 Life Magazine. His fellow correspondents included the following: Richard De‚ÄôRochemont, David Scherman, Will Lang, Charles Wertenbaker, Ralph Morse, Robert Capa, Janet Flanner, William Shirer, Noel Busch, H.V. Kaltenborn, and Ernest Hemingway.Life Magazine, Wertenbaker, Charles, Paris 1945, Pg. 46‚Äì55, Published by Time Inc., Chicago, IL, Vol. 19, No. 3, July 16, 1945 Artist and retired illustrator (1946‚Äì1956) In 1946, Floyd Davis was featured in a book titled 40 Illustrators and How They Work by Ernest W. Watson.Watson, Ernest, Floyd M. Davis, 40 Illustrators and How They Work, Published by Watson-Guptill Publications, PA, 1946 He continued to do some work for major publications like Saturday Evening Post but gradually slipped into retirement and illustrating or painting only for pleasure. During this time he enjoyed the company of his daughter Deborah Davis as they attended symphony and he took pride in the career of his son, Noel Davis, who became a rising star in the New York art world. Final chapter (1956‚Äì1966) Floyd Davis continued to paint during the final decade of his life. His works continued to appear in major print media as illustrations for stories and advertisements. His wife, Gladys Rockmore Davis, continued to exhibit and paint as well. In 1961, he was elected as the 5th inductee into The Illustrators Hall of Fame (external link).Reed, Walt & Roger, \\"The Illustrator in America, 1880‚Äì1980\\", A Century of Illustration, Published by Watson-Guptill Publications, PA, 2002 also American Art Archives, web site, http://www.americanartarchives.com/davis,floyd.htm Floyd MacMillan Davis died on October 25, 1966 at the Veterans Administration Hospital, First Avenue at 24th Street.

It was developed and published by Codemasters. It is considered a spiritual successor to the 2006 video game Black. Plot Bodycount revolves around Jackson, a former American soldier recruited by the enigmatic \\"Network\\", who has normally resolved conflicts between countries where even the UN could not. Over time, Jackson realises that wars are caused by some mysterious individuals. Gameplay The game is set in first-person. One of the main features is environment destructibility; nearly everything in the game is expected to be destructible. Environments and most of everything in them is destroyed realistically, creating a dynamically-changing playing environment. By scoring kills, the player can unlock deadly power-ups such as air strikes that further decimate the environment. There is a unique cover system where the player has near complete freedom while in cover. Multiplayer is available in competitive and cooperative modes. The former offers traditional deathmatch style sessions (individual or team-based) and the latter challenges two players to survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Reception Bodycount received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. As a result of very mixed reception Codemasters closed down their Guildford studio, laying off 70 employees and cutting down Codemasters' studio base by a third. The Guardian gave the Xbox 360 version a score of three stars out of five, saying that the game \\"isn't the future of first-person shooters. But it is great fun.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave the same version two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that it \\"professes to be a reaction to overblown, scripted rollercoaster FPSes, but never manages to bring a whole lot to the table for itself. Bodycount even makes a fuss over destructible cover, which was done better by Battlefield Bad Company. Bodycount is not a poor game, just a confused and unremarkable one, even if those instant restarts really are wonderful.\\" However, The Digital Fix gave the same version four out of ten, calling it \\"an ill conceived, poorly constructed, seemingly rushed mess which isn‚Äôt fun and in no way warrants its full price tag. It‚Äôs all been done before and a hell of a lot better, many times - keep your cash in your wallet (or purse).\\" 411Mania gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of three out of ten, saying that it \\"had a ton of potential. There are a few moments in the campaign that are quite fun and enjoyable but that isn‚Äôt enough to make this a great game by any means. Overall, it lacks in almost every area. It should have taken a note from Bulletstorm and focused on fun, over the top kills and details maps instead of trying to do everything perfect.

Playing career Born in Portugalete, Biscay, Aranguren joined Basque Country giants Athletic Bilbao's youth system at the age of 16, from neighbouring Sestao Sport Club. On 18 November 1962, one month shy of his 18th birthday, he made his first-team ‚Äì and La Liga ‚Äì debut, playing the entire 2‚Äì1 away win against C√≥rdoba CF, and finished his first season with 18 matches.

He is chair of the Pharmacology Department at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, as well as the founding director of the school's new Cancer Biology Institute. His area of research is signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation, which is important in many areas of cellular regulation, especially growth control and cancer. Schlessinger's work has led to an understanding of the mechanism of transmembrane signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases and how the resulting signals control cell growth and differentiation. Biography Josip Schlessinger was born in Topusko to Jewish parents. His father, Imre, was from Slatina; Imre's first wife and child had been deported to Auschwitz. Schlessinger's mother Rivka was from Bugojno; her first husband had been murdered by the Usta≈°e. Imre and Rivka met in a labor camp in 1943 on the Adriatic island of Rab and joined a group of Jewish Partisans. When Schlessinger was born on 26 March 1945 he was wrapped in a British military parachute. He was named for his grandfather. After World War II the family moved to Osijek, where another son, Darko David, was born. Imre Schlessinger once made a joke at the expense of Tito and was sentenced to several months in jail.Ha-Kol (Glasilo ≈Ωidovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Joseph Schlessinger odlikovan visokim Hrvatskim odliƒçjem; stranica 54; broj 111, listopad/rujan 2009. The family moved to Israel in 1948. Schlessinger served his compulsory military service with the Golani Brigade and was commissioned an officer. As part of his reserve duty he participated in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. Schlessinger received his BSc degree in Chemistry and Physics in 1968 (magna cum laude), and an M.Sc. degree in chemistry (also magna cum laude) in 1970 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He obtained his PhD degree in biophysics from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1974. From 1974‚Äì76, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Departments of Chemistry and Applied Physics at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, working with Watt W. Webb, among others. From 1977‚Äì78, he was a visiting fellow in the immunology branch of the National Cancer Institute. Personal life He is married to Irit Lax, an associate professor in the Pharmacology Department at Yale. They each have two children by previous marriages. In a 2009 interview with a Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji list, he said, \\"Basically I am atheist. I grew up Jewish and I truly belong to the Jewish culture, but I'm not a follower of any world religion. Religion does not interest me at all.\\" Academic career Schlessinger was a member of the faculty of the Weizmann Institute from 1978‚Äì1991 and was the Ruth and Leonard Simon Professor of Cancer Research in the Department of Immunology from 1985‚Äì1991. In addition, he was a Research Director for Rorer Biotechnology in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, from 1985‚Äì1990. In 1990, he was appointed as the Milton and Helen Kimmelman Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at the New York University School of Medicine. He served as Director of NYU Medical Center's Skirball Institute for Biomolecular Medicine, from 1998‚Äì2001. He has been the William H. Prusoff Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at Yale School of Medicine since 2001. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2000, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001, and to the Institute of Medicine in 2005. He is a member of the editorial boards of several journals, including Cell, Molecular Cell, the Journal of Cell Biology,J. Cell Biol. Masthead site and the Science magazine Science Signaling. Awards and recognition Schlessinger is the recipient of numerous prizes, including the Michael Landau Prize (1973), the Sara Leady Prize (1980), the Hestrin Prize (1983), the Levinson Prize (1984), a Ciba-Drew Award (1995), the Antoine Lacassagne Prize (1995), the Taylor Prize (2000),Taylor Prize announcement and the Dan David Prize (2006). In 2002, he was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa. He has lectured at many institutions, including the Harvey Society (in the 1993‚Äì1994 Harvey Lectures series) and the 2006 Keith R. Porter Lecture of the American Society for Cell Biology. In 2009, he was elected as a Member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 2012, the Hope Funds for Cancer Research selected Schlessinger to receive its Award of Excellence for Clinical Development. In 2009, Schlessinger was given an award by then-President of Croatia Stjepan Mesiƒá for outstanding service in promoting Croatia in the international scientific community and for the contribution within Croatian biomedical sciences. In September 2003, The Guardian listed him as number 14 in the \\"Giants of Science\\". He received, along with Charles Sawyers and Tony Hunter, the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Biomedicine category for \\"carving out the path that led to the development of a new class of successful cancer drugs.\\" Publications and research According to PubMed, Schlessinger has authored over 450 scientific original and review articles in the areas of pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology, mostly on tyrosine kinase signaling. Tyrosine kinase signaling plays a critical role in the control of many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, as well as cell survival and migration. Tyrosine kinases play a particularly important role in cancer, and several agents that block their activity are now used as anti-cancer drugs, such as Imatinib or Gleevec. Among his contributions are the findings that cell surface receptors with tyrosine kinase activity signal across membrane by forming dimers when they bind to their growth factor activators. He discovered this in studies of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). He was also instrumental in understanding how the SH2 domain controls tyrosine kinase signaling by binding to phosphorylated tyrosines in activated receptors. One of the seminal findings in this work was his laboratory's cloning of Grb2 and other Adaptor proteins. Another is the lab's cloning of FRS2, which is critical for signaling by the Fibroblast growth factor receptor. In 2001, he was ranked by the ISI Highly Cited as one of the world's top 30 most cited scientists (across all fields) in the 1990s. According to ISI, his papers have been cited a total of 76,699 times. Controversy In 2006, a sexual harassment lawsuit was initiated against Yale University by Schlessinger's former secretary, Mary Beth Garceau, who alleged numerous episodes of harassment during her employment at YaleUniversity of Hartford Media Watch (27 November - 4 December 2006), hartford.edu; accessed 28 February 2016.Yale ex-secretary sues for sex harassment From publication: \\"Women in Higher Education\\", accessmylibrary.com, 1 January 2007.\\"Harassment by Renowned Researcher Prompts Suit Against Yale\\", Chronicle of Higher Education], 2 December 2006. and claimed Yale University failed to act upon her frequent complaints, causing her to resign. The case was settled out of court in mid-2007 and the terms of the settlement were not publicly disclosed.\\"Another Lawsuit Against the University\\" , Yale Alumni Magazine, July 2007. SUGEN In 1991, Schlessinger co-founded (with Axel Ullrich and Steven Evans-Freke) the biotechnology company SUGEN to develop ATP-like molecules that would compete with ATP for binding to the catalytic site of receptor tyrosine kinases in cancer treatment. In 1999, Sugen was acquired by Pharmacia & Upjohn for $650 millionLos Angeles Times: \\"Pharmacia to Buy Sugen for $650 Million\\", 16 June 1999. and in 2003, Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer.Pfizer corporate website: \\"2003:Pfizer and Pharmacia Merger\\"; retrieved 29 September 2015. One of the pipeline products (SU11248) was ultimately developed by Pfizer as Sutent (Sunitinib), approved by the FDA for treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors and renal cell carcinoma. Plexxikon In 2001, Schlessinger co-founded Plexxikon with Sung-Hou Kim (University of California, Berkeley). Plexxikon, uses a pioneering structural biology-based platform for drug discovery.

Many of these factions are subgroups of parties, and groupings sometimes overlapped. Many factions (especially within the Moderate Party) were based on little more than political clientelism.Esdaile, p. 102 Carlists and Christinos When Isabella first became queen, she was only three years old.

The former supported absolute monarchism and the traditionalism of the Antiguo R√©gimen (\\"Old Regime\\"); they were uniformly close to the Roman Catholic Church, and generally clericalist. The latter were generally supporters of constitutional monarchy (although some, including Maria Christina herself, were more inclined toward enlightened absolutism); they were liberals of one stripe or another, ranging from liberal conservatives and those whose liberalism was strictly economic to social liberals.Esdaile, passim.

The latter two were the Democrats (dem√≥cratas, who established themselves as the Partido Progresista-Dem√≥crata in 1849)Esdaile, p. 389 and the Liberal Union (Uni√≥n Liberal, formally founded 1858).Esdaile, p. 112‚Äì113 In keeping with the Praetorianism that was such a factor in the Spanish politics of the time‚Äîcoups and coup attempts were routineEsdaile p. 76 et. seq.‚Äîthe Moderates, Progressives, and Liberal Union were each closely associated with a general, respectively Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez,Esdaile, especially p. 82‚Äì83 Baldomero Espartero,Esdaile, especially p. 79 and Leopoldo O'Donnell. Factions Within these parties were numerous factions; as remarked above, many of these were rather fluid (as, at times, were the parties themselves). To begin with, there were the docea√±istas, associated with the Cortes of C√°diz and the Constitution of 1812, and the veintea√±istas or exaltados, slightly younger, somewhat farther to the left, associated with the trienio liberal (1820‚Äì1823).Esdaile, p. 51‚Äì53 To a large extent, these corresponded to the Moderates and Progressives, respectively, though there were certainly exceptions.Joaqu√≠n Varela Suanzes, El pensamiento constitucional espa√±ol en el exilio : el abandono del modelo docea√±ista (1823-1833), Biblioteca Miguel de Cervantes. Retrieved 17 March 2010. Furthermore, there were the afrancesados (\\"Frenchified\\"), a term that could refer to anyone associated with the Enlightenment, but especially to those who had supported the regime of Joseph Bonaparte during the Peninsular War / War of Independence.Esdaile, p. 387‚Äì393 After the moderate Maria Christina was ousted as regent in September 1840, a division arose that crossed party lines, but importantly split the Progressives. Those who wanted a three-person council of regency were known as trinitarios (\\"Trinitarians\\"), those who wanted a single regent as unitarios (\\"Unitarians\\"). The Moderates were nearly all unitarios.Vilar, p. 191. The Moderates can generally be divided into puritanos and doctrinarios.Esdaile, p. 89 The former, headed by Joaqu√≠n Francisco Pacheco and Nicomedes Pastor D√≠az, favored strict constitutionalism according to the Constitution of 1837, even if it meant that the party was less likely to hold power continuously. The doctrinarios were more willing to use \\"illegality and subterfuge\\" to hold power for the party. The doctrinarios were further divided into fluid groups based on clientelism: narva√≠stas (around General Narv√°ez), monistas (around Alejandro Mon), pidalistas (followers of Pedro Pidal), and polacosEsdaile, passim., especially p. 89, 387‚Äì393 (around Luis Sartorius, and so named because of Sartorius's Polish ancestry.)Esdaile, p. 99 Also leagued with the Moderates were the vilumistas, led by the Marquess of Viluma, who wished to go back to the enlightened absolutism of the Royal Statute of 1834. The vilumistas, unlike most other Moderates, were open to a coalition with the Carlists. Among the Progressives, the divisions were more ideological. The right wing of the Progressives overlapped the Moderates politically.Esdaile, p. 79 et. seq. This included the isturizta personal faction around Francisco Javier Ist√∫riz, which at times allied with the Moderates against the rest of the Progressives.Esdaile, p. 72‚Äì73 et. seq. While some authors use exaltados almost interchangeably with progresistas, others view this as an anachronism.Ignacio Fern√°ndez Sarasola, Opini√≥n P√∫blica y ‚ÄúLibertades de Expresi√≥n‚Äù en el Constitucionalismo Espa√±ol (1726‚Äì1845) , Electronic Journal of Constitutional History, Number 7, September 2006, ISSN 1576-4729. Paragraph 31. Retrieved 17 March 2010. Left progresistas were also known as puros.Esdaile, p. 107 The Democrats also covered a wide range of views. Party leader Nicol√°s Rivero was a constitutional monarchist. Emilio Castellar and Francisco Pi y Margall were both republicans, but the former was more interested in winning the Progressives over to Republicanism and the latter with building a mass movement among the populacho. Sisto S√°enz de la C√°mara was socialist along lines similar to Louis Blanc in France; in 1855‚Äì1856, S√°enz advocated revolutionary terror, undermining the loose Progressive-Democrat alliance of the bienio progresista.Esdaile, p. 108 Finally, Leopoldo O'Donnell's Liberal Union, founded 1858, attempted to bridge nearly all of these groups. Its members included doctrinarios, puritanos, Progressives and even some Democrats.Esdaile, p. 112 Unsurprisingly, such a broad coalition eventually fragmented back into many separate pieces.Esdaile, p. 115‚Äì116 NotesReferences *Charles J.

The algorithm was designed for high performance backed by a formal analysis. VMAC is designed to have exceptional performance in software on 64-bit CPU architectures while still performing well on 32-bit architectures. Measured speeds are as fast as one-half CPU cycle per byte (cpb) on 64-bit architectures, under five cpb on desktop 32-bit processors, and around ten cpb on embedded 32-bit architectures. A closely related variant of VMAC that is optimized for 32-bit architectures is given by UMAC. Overview VMAC is a MAC in the style of Wegman and Carter. A fast \\"universal\\" hash function is used to hash an input message M into a short string. This short string is then combined by addition with a pseudorandom pad, resulting in the VMAC tag. Security depends on the sender and receiver sharing a randomly chosen secret hash function and pseudorandom pad. This is achieved by using keyed hash function H and pseudorandom function F. A tag is generated by performing the computation Tag = HK1(M) + FK2(Nonce) where K1 and K2 are secret random keys shared by sender and receiver, and Nonce is a value that changes with each generated tag. The receiver needs to know which nonce was used by the sender, so some method of synchronizing nonces needs to be used. This can be done by explicitly sending the nonce along with the message and tag, or agreeing upon the use of some other non-repeating value such as a sequence number. The nonce need not be kept secret, but care needs to be taken to ensure that, over the lifetime of a VMAC key, a different nonce is used with each message. VMAC uses a function, called VHASH (also specified in this document), as the keyed hash function H and uses a pseudorandom function F whose default implementation uses the AES block cipher. VMAC allows for tag lengths of any 64-bit multiple up to the block size of the block cipher in use. When using AES, this means VMAC can produce 64- or 128-bit tags. The theory of Wegman-Carter MACs and the analysis of VMAC show that if one \\"instantiates\\" VMAC with truly random keys and pads then the probability that an attacker (even a computationally unbounded one) produces a correct tag for messages of its choosing is less than 1/260 or 1/2120 when the tags are of length 64 or 128 bits, respectively. When an attacker makes N forgery attempts the probability of getting one or more tags right increases linearly to less than N/260 or N/2120. In an applied implementation of VMAC, using AES to produce keys and pads, these forgery probabilities increase by a small amount related to the security of AES. As long as AES is secure, this small additive term is insignificant for any practical attack. See specification for more details. Analysis of VMAC security has been carried out by authors Wei Dai and Ted Krovetz.

The five- story hotel had twenty-one rooms and eight baths. The hotel burned to the ground in 1917. Munyon also owned land in Palm Beach, Florida in an area known as the Styx. He rented out properties there mostly to African-Americans. He used sanitation as a cause to evict all of his 150 tenants in 1906 and later sold the land to Edward R.

While additions to the house have been added since the original structure was built, the main structure and its 1810 addition remain unchanged. The house contains almost all of its original hardware, molding and flooring. There are seven fireplaces in the home. The stone walls are nearly three feet thick. It is a two-story structure with a brick facade and Greek Revival details. It has a gambrel roof with wooden shingles. It has an L-shaped floor plan with tall ceilings (nine feet on the first floor). There is a pond on the property as well. The structure served as the Parsonage of the Dutch Reformed Church of Montville. Previously known as the Cornelius Doremus House, the Parsonage of the Montville Reformed Dutch Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The town of Montville recognized its significance by adding the home to its list of Historic Properties under Ord. No. 2012-17. The home was eligible for the National Register under Criterion C for architectural merit. It was part of a Multiple Property Documentation titled Dutch Stone Houses in Montville, N.J. submitted by Acroterion in September, 1990. Eight residences were included in the nomination, six of which were constructed between 1750 and 1790. Two had substantial additions/alterations ‚ÄîEffingham Low House, ca.1820 and Cornelius Doremus, 1840. Acroterion, on page 7 of their nominating documentation stated, ‚Äúit is also noteworthy that the last true ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù stone house was built in 1796.‚Äù By 1840, much of the original Doremus House had been subsumed by additions and alterations including the introduction of Greek Revival details on front facade. The 1840 renovations left the building a hybrid stylistically. It has a front (east) fa√ßade that is primarily Greek Revival, a side (south) facade that is a stone Dutch Colonial, and a rear (west) facade made of a mixture of stone, bricks and wood shingle siding. The Doremus House was one of two houses, of the eight nominated, that was not included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). HABS is administered by the National Park Service and is the nation's first federal preservation program, begun in 1933 to document America's architectural heritage. Buildings are typically selected for HABS documentation because of their historic and/or architectural importance. The fundamental intent of HABS documentation is to illustrate and explain this significance. To date, over 38,600 historical structures have been documented by the program. The house was deemed historically significant due to its visible progression and changes over time and the influence that the opening of Montville due to the Morris Canal had on the township.

Biography De Regibus was born in √âpalinges, a commune in the canton of Vaud, part of French-speaking Switzerland. His father, Pierre de Regibus, was a descendant of an Italian family originally from Bologna. In 1889, de Regibus moved to Yverdon-les-Bains with his mother. In that city, he worked as a locksmith at the Jura‚ÄìSimplon Railway carriage repair works while his mother earned money by selling chestnuts. In Yverdon, de Regibus got to be involved in various sports, most notably gymnastics, boxing and association football, and he soon received a federal gymnastics instructor's diploma.–ü–∞–π—Ç–∞—à–µ–≤.–°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω–æ–≤, p. 9. An acquaintance of de Regibus who played for Grasshoppers remembered him as a \\"quality goalkeeper\\". De Regibus' physique made him a suitable sportsman: of middle height, he had a very wide chest and appeared strong and thickset.–ë–æ–∂–∫–æ–≤. Georges de Regibus arrived in the Principality of Bulgaria in 1894. He came to that country along with nine other Swiss gymnastics teachers as part of a delegation of the Swiss Gymnastics Federation. The Swiss teachers had been invited during Bulgarian Minister of Education Georgi Zhivkov's visit to Lausanne in 1893 in order to familiarize Bulgarian people with formal physical education and organized sports. Other notable Swiss among these sports teachers were Charles Champaud, a teacher in Sofia regarded as the first person to represent Bulgaria at the Olympic Games (at the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics), and Louis-Emil Eyer (1865‚Äì1919), a Bulgarophile who died as a Bulgarian Army soldier in World War I.–°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω–æ–≤, pp. 11‚Äì12. De Regibus was appointed as a teacher by the Varna High School for Boys on 13 May 1894. Having brought his personal leather football to Varna, he introduced football to his pupils of several different grades, which marked the first time that sport was practised in the country. This happened in the high school yard over a few days near the end of the 1893‚Äì94 school year, i.e. in late spring or early summer of 1894. De Regibus established football as a regular extracurricular activity, which was met with enthusiastic support by the pupils.–°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω–æ–≤, pp. 6‚Äì7. The Swiss teacher would pick out groups of 10‚Äì12 strong runners from two school classes and organize a football game between them. In the memories of Economic Life magazine editor and pupil Nikola Konstantinov, the earliest matches were contested between the 6th and 7th grades of the high school. He recalled that the leader and captain of the 7th grade team was Vasil Kolarov from Shumen who went on to become one of Bulgaria's chief communist politicians and Prime Minister of Bulgaria (1949‚Äì1950).–ê–≤—Ä–∞–º–æ–≤. While the first matches took place in the high school yard, later games were organized at various places in the fields around Varna, including an improvised pitch by the Black Sea coast where the Sea Garden was built a few years later. De Regibus was normally the referee of these school matches, though according to pupil and later professor Petar Petkov he would often join the game doubling as a player.–°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω–æ–≤, p. 14. De Regibus remained in Bulgaria until 12 July 1896, when his two-year teacher's contract expired. Upon returning to Switzerland in 1896, he opened a caf√© in Treycovagnes and then another one in Yverdon. After that, he spent nearly two decades as a sports teacher in Egypt, though towards the end of World War I (1914‚Äì1918) he returned to Switzerland once more and settled in Lausanne. Georges de Regibus died in that city in late 1927; he was survived by his wife Louise who perished in 1941. The ashes of the two were placed in a common urn in the Lausanne crematory's chapel.–°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω–æ–≤, p. 10.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Anolis luciae, p. 162). Geographic range A. luciae is widespread on Saint Lucia and its offshore islets. Description The coloration and markings of A. luciae vary. Its dorsal ground color ranges from brown in drier habitats to bright green in wetter areas. Some populations have blue coloration on the sides, and the ventral surface may be white or yellowish. The area around the eye may be white, blue, or green. Males may be patternless or have reticulations or chevron patterns on the dorsal surface. Females are duller than males, and may have a mid-dorsal stripe or dark chevron markings. Reproduction A. luciae is oviparous. Invasive species A. luciae co- exists on Saint Lucia with two introduced anole species: A. extremus and A. wattsi. A. luciae appears to be resisting competition, and the two invasive species are restricted to areas around the capital, Castries.Malhotra, Anita; Thorpe, Roger S. (1999).

The first missionary, Reverend Thomas Thompson served the area from 1745-1751. He was assigned to Stafford Township by the \\"English Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.\\" A spirit of tolerance was evident in the early church, as it ministered to people of several Protestant faiths. In 1770, Captain Thomas Webb is reported to have visited the village, preached at the church, and formed a Baptist Society with nine members. In 1774, when the church called its first pastor, the Reverend H. Crossley, the congregation numbered 19. During the Revolutionary War, in the \\"Skirmish at Manahawken\\", between Captain Rueben Randolphs's Manahawkin Militia and John Beacon's \\"Band of Pine Pirates\\" or \\"Refugees\\", wounded members of the Manahawkin Militia were cared for in the church. Several veterans of the Revolution are buried in the cemetery surrounding the church along with local residents and shipwreck victims. Services were discontinued during the War and the Baptist Society was not reorganized until 1801. In 1805, the church baptized forty-four people and the membership increased to sixty-eight. On April 27, 1857, the church was incorporated under the laws of the state of New Jersey by the five trustees. By 1864, weakening walls prompted the appointment of a committee to start remodeling and rebuilding the structure. The rebuilt church with the original within it was completed under the leadership of Reverend A. H. Folwell. On July 10, 1867, during the pastorate of Reverend E.S. Browe, the dedication service was held. The cost of rebuilding and redecorating the church building cost 2,776 dollars. The records show that all but $200.00 had come from church members and interested friends. The centennial anniversary of the founding as a Baptist Society was held on August 25, 1870. The church building was the only school building in Stafford until after 1800 and the Bible was the only textbook. Reverend E.L. Stager became a pastor in February 1880 but died 2 years later at age 35. Following these events a series of ministers came and went, usually staying about a year. The first parsonage was built in 1882 near the church on Route 9. On January 12, 1884, Reverend W.W. Eldridge was unanimously called as pastor. The women of the church cleaned the parsonage each week, as Eldridge was a single man. In September 1885, Reverend Warren N. Walden was called as pastor and remained in the position until his death in December 1893. The pastoral call was then extended to the Reverend E.F. Partridge in February 1898. The congregation voted to pay him a yearly sum of $300. A new organ was purchased in 1898, and most likely was the one that remained in the church until a Hammond organ was purchased in 1948. In 1901, the pastoral call was offered to Herman Joorman, who eventually left the church to serve in the mission field. From 1901 until 1948, more pastors served the church, with several working only part-time. In 1916, small rooms and a baptistry were added to the original church structure. Sometime between 1920- 1925 the church spire was struck by lightning and the spire, roof, and bell were damaged. At that time the steeple was lowered to its present height. In 1938, church member Jim Shanklin and Jack Kilbert, a seminary student who had just moved to the area, led worship services. The practice continued until 1943 when Kilbert was killed by a mortar round that landed near his tent during the Battle of the Bulge. Reverend Lauren D Rhine was extended the call to begin the charge here in April 1948. The faithful of the church had just entirely redecorated the church. A new roof was installed and the building was painted inside and out. On Mothers Day 1948 bible school was started with 8 attendees. By 1952 the number had grown to 115. During the summer of 1949, the first daily vacation bible school was started with eight teachers and thirty- nine pupils. By 1950, vacation bible school enrollment had increased to twelve teachers and sixty-eight pupils. At the annual meeting in 1950, the church voted to become a charter church in fellowship with the Association. In the winter of 1952, a new parsonage was acquired on the corner of Main and Beach Streets in Manahawkin. Reverend and Mrs. Lauren Rhine were the first occupants. Beginner and primary school were held each week. The church membership totaled fifty-eight and the church supported two foreign missionaries. From 1952 to 1955, the congregation bought 100 feet of land on Route 9, across from the existing building and proposed to build a 32 feet by 60 feet Sunday school there. According to the plans, the building would have a basement and one floor. The building committee chose Bill Shinn, a church member, and a local builder, to oversee the construction, which was completed with volunteer labor. John Erwin was called to the pulpit on July 6, 1953. Pastor Erwin was the first full-time pastor, as he did not need another job to supplement the income provided by the church. IN 1955, according to the records from church treasurer Althea Fredrickson, $3500 of the church budget, which totaled, $4984, went to the pastor's salary. Reverend Earl Comfort was called to be a pastor in January 1959. The parsonage was sold for $7500 and a new parsonage was built next to the Sunday School building in June 1961. Between 1962 and 1965 two pieces of property were acquired on the north side of the original church. Both were used for parking. The congregation decided to build a new sanctuary perpendicular to the Sunday School building. The addition would have Sunday School rooms in the basement.

DM is a general paradigm alongside a specified framework that is suitable for computer processing and includes: holistic, coherent, volumetric modeling systems; symbolic languages that are able to handle infinite degrees of freedom and detail in a compact format; and the direct interaction and/or fabrication of any object at any spatial resolution without the need for ‚Äúlossy‚Äù or intermediate formats. DM systems possess the following attributes: * realistic - correct spatial mapping of matter to information * exact - exact language and/or methods for input from and output to matter * infinite - ability to operate at any scale and define infinite detail * symbolic - accessible to individuals for design, creation and modification Such an approach can not only be applied to tangible objects but can include the conversion of things such as light and sound to/from information and matter. Systems to digitally materialize light and sound already largely exist now (e.g. photo editing, audio mixing, etc.) and have been quite effective - but the representation, control and creation of tangible matter is poorly support by computational and digital systems. Commonplace computer-aided design and manufacturing systems currently represent real objects as \\"2.5 dimensional\\" shells. In contrast, DM proposes a deeper understanding and sophisticated manipulation of matter by directly using rigorous mathematics as complete volumetric descriptions of real objects. By utilizing technologies such as Function representation (FRep) it becomes possible to compactly describe and understand the surface and internal structures or properties of an object at an infinite resolution. Thus models can accurately represent matter across all scales making it possible to capture the complexity and quality of natural and real objects and ideally suited for digital fabrication and other kinds of real world interactions. DM surpasses the previous limitations of static disassociated languages and simple human-made objects, to propose systems that are heterogeneous, interacting directly and more naturally with the complex world.T. Vilbrandt, E. Malone, H. Lipson, A. Pasko, Universal Desktop Fabrication, in Heterogeneous Objects Modelling and Applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4889, Springer Verlag, 2008, pp. 259-284 Digital and computer-based languages and processes, unlike the analogue counterparts, can computationally and spatially describe and control matter in an exact, constructive and accessible manner.

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson. The cathedral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History By the middle of the 1820s, there were definite indications that the local Catholic population was expanding. Coupled with the tremendous growth of Paterson industries, there was an insistent demand for skilled millhands and other types of workers. By 1870, the U.S. Census reported that Irish immigrants constituted the dominant foreign-born population in the city. The majority of the Irish, along with other immigrant classes, lived in ramshackle tenement houses within almost walking distance of the great mills. Most conspicuously, the Irish clustered about Grand Street, and this area became known as the \\"Dublin\\" section of Paterson. It was there, among the Irish-Catholic immigrants, that Father William N. McNulty began his priestly duties. Two years after arriving in Paterson to take \\"...charge of the fortunes and spiritual welfare ....\\" of the rapidly growing Catholic population, Father McNulty entered into negotiations with the powerful industrial corporation, the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (\\"S.U.M.\\"), and in 1865 purchased from it sixteen lots on the corner of Grand and Main streets thus ensuring the future of a more larger St. John's Church (later Cathedral of St. John the Baptist). The new enterprise seemed to infuse new vigor into the members of the congregation, and the full amount of the purchase money of the real estate ($10,000) was raised in two months. Preparations were made for the construction of the new church, New York architect P. C. Keely was retained in order to develop plans \\"for an edifice ... unequaled in New Jersey.\\", and on September l0, 1865, the corner-stone was laid. The church was ready for use in the summer of 1870, and a final tabulation a number of years later revealed that approximately $200,000 had been spent in the course of construction. It was raised to cathedral status when the Diocese of Paterson was established in 1937.

Between 1952 and August 1960, she made 19 deployments to the Mediterranean Sea to replenish the ships of the Sixth Fleet. In addition to these voyages, the vessel made eight short cruises to the Caribbean for replenishment of bases and units there as well as for training and liberty. =Missiles support= Between August and November 1960, Alcor underwent two restricted availabilities at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard which altered the cargo ship to enable her to transport, monitor, and handle Polaris missiles and their parts. Alcor was designated resupply ship for fleet ballistic missile submarines and tenders deployed overseas. Tests of her new capability were successfully conducted with training missiles alongside anchored five miles off Charleston, South Carolina in November 1960 and with the actual weapons alongside Proteus and at New London, Connecticut, in February 1961. In March, Alcor got underway for her first of 15 resupply voyages to Holy Loch, Scotland, during the next four years in support of fleet ballistic missile operations. In 1962, her home port was changed to Charleston, South Carolina, to facilitate the loading of provisions and Polaris missiles for the tender deployed at Holy Loch. In April 1964, when the second overseas FBM resupply site was activated in Rota, Spain, she began operations replenishing the newly commissioned tender based there and made six round trips during the first year. From 1965 until 1968, Alcor continued to deploy to Rota and Holy Loch in support of the Polaris missile program. The cargo ship also delivered supplies where needed to units of the 2d and 6th Fleets and provided exercise and training services during Fleet operations in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Decommissioning and fate On 30 December 1968, Alcor was decommissioned at Charleston; and her name was struck from the Navy list on the following day. The cargo ship was sold to Lotti S.P.A. of Italy, in January 1970 and scrapped.

The library system has more than 2.4 million items of print and media materials, as well as extensive online journals and research databases. OCL is a member of the OhioLINK consortium which provides rapid access to an additional 50 million volumes from colleges and universities across Ohio. On October 6, 2018 the Main Library located in the Mudd Center, was renamed for Oberlin graduate Mary Church Terrell (class of 1884, 1888, and Hon. 1948), who is held in high esteem because she was one of the first African-American women to earn a college degree History Under the leadership of college librarian Azariah Smith Root (1887‚Äì1927), the Oberlin College Library grew by the end of his tenure to the sixteenth largest academic library in the nation. The former central library, which was funded by Andrew Carnegie, opened in 1908 and served both the college and the town of Oberlin for almost seven decades. The current main library in Mudd Center opened in 1974. The Oberlin College Library, under the direction of Library Director Eileen Thornton, was a founding member of OCLC and also the first independent college library to join the OhioLINK consortium. The library directors of the Oberlin Group, a national consortium of selective liberal arts college libraries, first met at Oberlin College in 1986.

In particular, a Pompeiu derivative is discontinuous at any point where it is not 0. Whether non-identically zero such functions may exist was a problem that arose in the context of early-1900s research on functional differentiability and integrability. The question was affirmatively answered by Dimitrie Pompeiu by constructing an explicit example; these functions are therefore named after him. Pompeiu's construction Pompeiu's construction is described here. Let denote the real cube root of the real number . Let be an enumeration of the rational numbers in the unit interval . Let be positive real numbers with . Define by :g(x): = a_0+\\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\,a_j \\\\sqrt[3]{x-q_j}. For any in , each term of the series is less than or equal to in absolute value, so the series uniformly converges to a continuous, strictly increasing function , by the Weierstrass -test. Moreover, it turns out that the function is differentiable, with :g^{\\\\prime}(x) := \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_j}{\\\\sqrt[3]{(x-q_j)^2}}>0, at any point where the sum is finite; also, at all other points, in particular, at any of the , one has . Since the image of is a closed bounded interval with left endpoint :g(0) = a_0-\\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\,a_j \\\\sqrt[3]{q_j}, up to the choice of , we can assume and up to the choice of a multiplicative factor we can assume that maps the interval onto itself. Since is strictly increasing it is injective, and hence a homeomorphism; and by the theorem of differentiation of the inverse function, its inverse has a finite derivative at any point, which vanishes at least at the points . These form a dense subset of (actually, it vanishes in many other points; see below). Properties * It is known that the zero-set of a derivative of any everywhere differentiable function is a subset of the real line. By definition, for any Pompeiu function this set is a dense set, therefore by the Baire category theorem it is a residual set. In particular, it possesses uncountably many points. * A linear combination of Pompeiu functions is a derivative, and vanishes on the set , which is a dense set by the Baire category theorem. Thus, Pompeiu functions form a vector space of functions. * A limit function of a uniformly convergent sequence of Pompeiu derivatives is a Pompeiu derivative. Indeed, it is a derivative, due to the theorem of limit under the sign of derivative. Moreover, it vanishes in the intersection of the zero sets of the functions of the sequence: since these are dense sets, the zero set of the limit function is also dense. * As a consequence, the class of all bounded Pompeiu derivatives on an interval is a closed linear subspace of the Banach space of all bounded functions under the uniform distance (hence, it is a Banach space). *Pompeiu's above construction of a positive function is a rather peculiar example of a Pompeiu's function: a theorem of Weil states that generically a Pompeiu derivative assumes both positive and negative values in dense sets, in the precise meaning that such functions constitute a residual set of the Banach space .

One of the earliest Methodist congregations organized in both New Jersey and the United States, Harmony Hill Methodist Church was established in 1802 along the Flanders Circuit, a large, nearly 400-mile circuit of several churches in northwestern New Jersey, Southern New York and Pennsylvania that was served by travelling ministers. The congregation met in its early members' barns and homes until the current structure, a wood-frame building, was erected in 1832-1833\\\\. Its founders were either previously members (including original founders) of the Stillwater Presbyterian Church when that church was affiliated as a joint Lutheran and German Reformed congregation (before 1822), or from descendants of those founders, as the population of Stillwater assimilated from its Palatine German roots to English-oriented American culture. Harmony Hill Methodist Church is listed on both the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 2002 for its significance in architecture, art, and music from 1892 to 1930. With  History  On April 18, 1853, St. Mary's Episcopal Church (which is now called Grace Church or Grace Episcopal Church) was established. Three months later, the cornerstone of the church edifice was laid at East Front Street between Richmond and Berckman Streets in Plainfield ‚Äì land the church had received as a gift ‚Äì and construction was completed by early autumn. Over the next decade the congregation outgrew the Church Building, and purchased the current site in the then-posh uptown neighborhood of Seventh Street and Sycamore Street (now Cleveland Avenue) and the original building was relocated. The removal and reconstruction of the old edifice was completed during the summer of 1876, and the congregation worshiped in the ‚Äúnew‚Äù church for the first time on October 15, 1876. As Plainfield grew, it became a populous commuter town, the decision to build a larger church suitable for the needs of the church and its community was made. They turned to renowned architect Robert W. Gibson, who was also responsible for several historic landmark New York City buildings, to design Grace Church as a stone Gothic- Revival structure with carved red sandstone trim and hints of the Romanesque.  Architecture  On May 5, 1891, the cornerstone of the new church was laid, and the first service in the new edifice was on April 17, 1892. In design and workmanship, Grace Church reflects late 19th century ecclesiastical architecture. The building is a two-story cruciform plan Gothic Revival style, characterized by the use of asymmetry, cruciform plan, pointed arched windows and arches, gothic style door carvings, and decorative sandstone trim around door and window openings. The church has a central nave flanked by narrow side aisles. Clerestory windows above the aisles illuminate the interior. The chapel in the South Transept of the Nave is a memorial to Walter C. Scott and dedicated in 1966 designated as the Chapel of Christ the King. The pulpit of white oak was dedicated on All Saints Day, 1964, in memory of Dorothy Fleming Waring. In niches between the several carved linen fold panels are the Four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which were carved in Italy. At the foot of each figure is a carved symbol of the four Gospels. The Parish House, constructed in 1905, has six classrooms, and two offices on the second level. The Lower level consists of five classrooms, a small gymnasium, Offices where Plainfield Community Outreach is located, Choirmaster's Office, and Choir room. The main floor houses All Saints Chapel, Vestry Meeting Room, and parlor which connects the Kitchen. At the end of the hallway, there is a large assembly hall named after Dr. Harry James Knickle, the 9th Rector. On the opposite end of the main floor leading into the church is the Church office, and Rectors Office.  Ackerman Memorial Garden  The Ackerman Memorial Garden was dedicated on Sunday, May 18, 1969. The garden was given by the Ackerman sons in memory of their father and mother, were lifelong, devoted and faithful members of Grace Church. The Building & Maintenance Commission oversees the planting and grounds keeping. Today, with the plantings of flowers that attract various butterflies, the garden has been called ‚Äúthe Butterfly Garden.‚Äù Parishioners may choose to have their cremains buried in the garden.

This building burned down in 1929. Wyntoon is the name of a private estate in rural Siskiyou County, California, owned by the Hearst Corporation. Architects Willis Polk, Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan all designed structures for Wyntoon, beginning in 1899. The land, sited at two sharp bends in the McCloud River, was named by financial adviser Edward Clark for the local Native American tribe of the Wintun people. Beginning as a humble fishing resort, the land was improved by a series of people, notably San Francisco attorney Charles Stetson Wheeler, his client Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and her son William Randolph Hearst who disputed with his cousin over ownership. Prominent structures, noted for their architecture, have been built on the land, some lost to fire, while other multimillion-dollar buildings were planned, but not built. Famous visitors to Wyntoon include Clark Gable, Charles Lindbergh, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and his son John F. Kennedy.  Justin Sisson's fishing resort  The earliest known inhabitants of the area of Wyntoon were the Winnemem Wintu tribe of Native Americans, a subgroup of the Wintun people. In the 1880s, outdoorsman, guide, hunter and trapper Justin Hinckley Sisson came to the area and established a hotel, restaurant and tavern at the foot of Mount Shasta. He advocated for a railroad line to be extended northward from Redding to his location, and was successful. Construction of the Central Pacific Railroad through the Siskiyou Trail began in the mid-1880s, and Sisson bought in its path. The railroad was completed in 1887 and brought miners, hunters, fishermen, loggers, naturalists and tourists. With his wife, the former Miss Lydia Field, Sisson operated the inn, and he led various groups of hunters, geologists and mountain climbers. With profits from his successful business, Sisson acquired large parcels of land including the tract which would become Wyntoon. He established the town of Sisson surrounding his inn, and he built a fishing resort a half-day's ride away on the McCloud River, at an elevation between , some distant. Popular with hunters and fishermen, it became known as \\"Sisson's-on-the-McCloud\\". Justin Sisson died in 1893. In 1924, the town of Sisson was renamed Mount Shasta, California.  Charles S. Wheeler's hunting lodge  Most of Willis Polk's 1899 structure \\"The Bend\\" was torn down in 1934 and rebuilt by Julia Morgan. In 1899, Sisson's widow sold the McCloud River fishing resort site to Charles Stetson Wheeler, a wealthy attorney from San Francisco. This parcel lay in the Cascade Range of mountains, south by southeast of Mount Shasta. Wheeler called this holding the Wheeler Ranch, and he built a hunting lodge on the river at Horseshoe Bend‚Äîits cornerstone was laid in 1899. The multi-wing lodge, dramatic with its stone walls and slate roof, was designed by San Francisco architect Willis Polk, and included an 800-book library with room for hundreds of Native American baskets. Wheeler directed Polk to give the lodge a \\"fish tower\\"‚Äîa high study with a view, and two windows which were aquariums containing local trout. A Latin inscription over the entrance indicated this room was a temple to fishing: piscatoribus sacrum. Polk's design was pictured in July 1899 in The American Architect and Building News which described it as a \\"California Mountain Home\\". Sir Banister Fletcher included the building in a list of Shingle Style architecture. The layout of the structure, a \\"rambling group of masses\\", snaked through the trees, curving to follow the bend in the river, the curve creating a courtyard with a circular drive and a central fountain. The dining room enjoyed a three-sided view of the river, and diners could take the air on a wraparound porch. The porch opened to the river in a flight of wooden steps leading down to an octagonal gazebo pierced and supported by a large tree, overhanging the tumbling waters. Massive fireplaces and heavy timbers gave the impression of a medieval estate interior. Polk's use of stone and wood on the exterior achieved a sense of compatibility with the land, celebrating the setting's primal beauty. From 1900 to 1934, Charles Stetson Wheeler's The Bend was downstream of Wyntoon. Afterward, the properties were combined. The Wheeler family stayed at the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst asked if she could purchase the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her. Wheeler retained the part of Wheeler Ranch that was not leased to Hearst, including The Bend. In 1911, Wheeler invited Austro-Hungarian artist and naturalist Edward Stuhl and his wife Rosie to live on the property; they made extensive studies of plant and animal life in the area, and collected many hundreds of specimens. Stuhl, an avid mountain climber, published Wildflowers of Mount Shasta from his base at Wheeler Ranch. After Wheeler's death in 1923, Stuhl served as custodian of the ranch. William Randolph Hearst bought Wyntoon outright from its 99-year lease in 1929, and in 1934 bought all of Wheeler Ranch and The Bend, a combined total of .  Phoebe Hearst's castle  Bernard Maybeck's Wyntoon project seen in 1906. It burned down in 1929. Phoebe Hearst, upon signing the 99-year lease, decided to build a very grand residence. She hired Bernard Maybeck to design one in the Gothic style of a Rhine River castle. The structure was mainly complete in 1902, and cost Hearst $100,000. Maybeck hired Julia Morgan to assist in the design. The castle's layout was fitted to the slope of the site, and to a semicircle of six tall conifers. Its footprint was ; an underground cellar was wide, high, and ran the length of the building, containing stores and a central heating furnace supplying steam throughout the building. The central tower made of stone reached to a height of . A plumbed room entered from the outside allowed fishermen and hunters to clean their catch and themselves. Six floors of sleeping rooms were contained in the central tower; each bedroom entered from landings along the main spiral staircase carved of stone. The exterior of the tower was thick load-bearing crowning wall topped with a steeply angled roof to hold the weight of snow, and to shed excess snow. Glazed Paris-green tile from the Netherlands surfaced the roof, providing \\"a misty color like the holes between the branches in the trees in the forest.\\" Bluish-gray basalt volcanic stone was quarried from local lava flows; it supplied the strength of the massive walls. 1906 living room interior The living room, , had at one end an alcove framing a stained glass window, a copy of the 13th century one in Lorenzkirche in Nuremberg, the reproduction fabricated in the Netherlands. The room's apex was 36 feet high‚Äîa meeting of steeply angled wooden beams resting on thick stone walls. A tall fireplace separated the alcove from the majority of the living room; a large man could stand in its opening. Another fireplace warmed the other end of the living room. Tapestries hung from the stone walls to add a medieval appearance. Frederick Meyer made furniture for this room, and for all Wyntoon, in European vernacular style. Exterior of the living room showing a stained glass window. The scale is deceptive: A man standing under the window ledge would not reach the bottom of the sill. Maybeck designed a dining hall much like the living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached to the top of the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery. Phoebe Hearst also built other structures including The Gables‚Äîa storybook dwelling for overflow guests‚Äîand a \\"Honeymoon Cottage\\". The castle was habitable in 1902, completely finished in 1904. It was featured in American Homes and Gardens in 1906, a three-page spread; the same space given the house in Architectural Review in 1904. The writer in Architectural Review criticized the quaint wooden carvings which gave the impression of \\"pastry and perfume\\", but praised the most important aspects of the structure: Wyntoon from across the McCloud River in 1906 Hearst summered at Wyntoon and raised her son's children there when he was not watching them. William Randolph Hearst and his wife Millicent produced five sons from 1904 to 1915‚Äîeach one spent summer months at Wyntoon with grandmother. The boys' father sent instructions about their upbringing, writing after the eldest boy George Randolph Hearst was nearly washed down the McCloud, that the boys needed \\"a severe warning about the river\\". Hearst occasionally entertained her society friends and acquaintances at Wyntoon, bringing selected guests up north from the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition of 1915. At her death in 1919, she willed Wyntoon to her niece Anne Apperson Flint, along with a Cadillac car and $250,000. Flint moved in with her husband, Joseph Marshall Flint, M.D, a former Yale professor of surgery. During this time, architect Julia Morgan designed four structures which were built at Wyntoon: a superintendent's residence and a separate servant's quarters in 1924, and in 1925, a stables building holding a caretaker's house erected near a \\"Swiss Chalet\\" which was built for higher-status domestic staff.  William Randolph Hearst's projects  From his mother's will, William Randolph Hearst received the bulk of the family inheritance, including the ranch in San Simeon, the Babicora Ranch in Mexico, a fruit orchard in Butte County, and various mining and industrial stocks, the whole worth around 5‚Äì10 million dollars. Wyntoon, however, was given to his cousin Anne Apperson Flint in his mother's will, and Hearst was angered over this. He refused to return to Flint any of the art objects from Wyntoon that had been loaned to the Palace of Fine Arts for an exhibit. In 1925 after years of acrimonious negotiation, he bought Wyntoon from Flint for $198,000, but he remained forever embittered toward his cousin. In the winter of 1929‚Äì1930, Maybeck's Wyntoon masterpiece burned down, possibly from a kitchen fire. Time magazine reported Hearst's losses at $300,000 to $500,000, including portions of his art collection. In early 1930, Hearst contracted to have Morgan design an even larger castle as replacement. Morgan was already working for Hearst on Hearst Castle in San Simeon and nearly finished with The Hacienda near King City. Morgan collaborated with her early mentor and teacher Maybeck on plans for an eight-story Bavarian Gothic-style castle with two great towers and more minor turrets, some 61 bedrooms proposed for Wyntoon's largest building project. Hearst instructed Arthur Byne, his art agent based in Madrid, to find likely buildings he could purchase for their stonework, to give Wyntoon an ancient air. In December 1930, Byne discovered Santa Maria de Ovila, a 700-year-old Cistercian monastery, and Hearst paid $97,000 for it. The monastery was taken apart and removed illegally, but the Spanish government was changing hands and was not effective in stopping Hearst's hired men. Some 10,000 stones were shipped to a warehouse in San Francisco at a total cost of about $1 million. Another old structure removed from Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory had been used by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities. In the spring of 1931, Morgan offered several designs for Hearst's consideration, all of them using the stones of the Spanish monastery on the ground floor, reinforced by steel girders to take the weight of the upper floors. Portions of the monastery were considered as a library, an \\"armory\\", and a living room. The final proposal from Morgan included an indoor swimming pool constructed from the monastery's old church. The long swimming pool featured changing rooms and lounges in the old side chapels, shallow water for wading in the apse, deep water in the central plunge, and a diving board where the altar had been. In July 1931, as a steam shovel was making ready to level enough land to accommodate the great castle, Hearst put a stop to all his construction plans. The Great Depression had greatly diminished his income, and he could not pay for his $50 million project at Wyntoon while at the same time indulging his expansion at San Simeon. Abandoning the massive castle idea, Hearst instead asked Morgan to design a \\"Bavarian Village\\" with multiple half-timbered buildings in the medieval style of Germany or Austria. Hearst sent Morgan to Europe to study suitable buildings; she brought fine artist Doris Day with her to investigate architectural inscriptions and painting styles. In 1932, Morgan put together a master plan for Wyntoon. It described a group of guesthouses with romantic names such as Cinderella House, Fairy House and Bear House, arranged not in a cramped medieval style but symmetrically around a common green in the Beaux-Arts style. These three-story structures with steeply gabled roofs were completed in 1933. Swiss artisan Jules Suppo and his assistants carved much of the German Gothic decorations. Day painted fine inscriptions and exterior decorative patterns. Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany painted exterior murals depicting Russian and Germanic fairy tales such as those from the Brothers Grimm, but Pogany's versions were bright, humorous and cheerful, not dark and grim. Downstream of the Bavarian Village, Morgan's plan called for a selection of leisure activities. A swimming pool with a pool house was to be near tennis courts and a croquet lawn, and a dining hall called \\"The Gables\\" would be equipped to show films. Though San Simeon could house perhaps 30 to 50 guests, the expanded Wyntoon plan could accommodate 100 for a weekend.Procter, 2007, p. 182 In 1934, Hearst bought all of Wheeler Ranch. Polk's structure \\"The Bend\\" was torn down except for one wing containing the master bedroom. This wing held the cornerstone engraved \\"The Bend ‚Äì 1899\\". The rest of the building was redesigned by Morgan in Gothic Revival style and rebuilt from 1935 to 1941 using many of its original stones. William Randolph Hearst walks amid buildings of the Bavarian Village, followed by his dachshund Gandhi. This image by Peter Stackpole was one of a series published by Life magazine in a 1935 article. On January 1, 1935, photographer Peter Stackpole's images of Wyntoon were published in Life magazine, showing Hearst relaxing at Wyntoon with friends. Hearst's communications office at Wyntoon was shown in the photos; it was built next to Bear House to keep him abreast of current events. This office was fitted into a shingle-covered bungalow built to house Joe Willicombe, Hearst's private secretary. The structure served as the \\"nerve center\\" of Hearst's publishing empire, with three round-the-clock operators minding the telegraph facilities and the telephone switchboard. In mid-1937, Hearst was forced by bankruptcy to sign over all of his holdings to a group of trustees called the Conservation Committee. Wyntoon was included, it was estimated the prior year to be worth $300,000. Headed by New York Judge Clarence J. Shearn, the trustees slashed Hearst's costs and halted the smaller side projects at San Simeon and Wyntoon which had kept so many contractors busy. Wyntoon was maintained only by a skeleton staff paid for by the Hearst Corporation. Hearst never hosted more than 14 guests at Wyntoon after the bankruptcy. From 1938 to 1940, Hearst's art collections were cataloged and sold, including items from Wyntoon. Hearst was made to pay rent out of his allowance when he stayed at any of his properties. After the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, blackout conditions were imposed on San Simeon because of its nearness to the ocean and associated likelihood of Japanese shelling, so before Christmas Hearst moved to Wyntoon with his lover, actress Marion Davies. There, the two lived in Bear House at the river's edge with their pet dachshunds. Davies' cherished dachshund named Gandhi, 15 years old, fell gravely ill during this time; a veterinarian was called and the animal put down by injection. Distraught, Davies raged through Bear House, later writing: \\"I broke everything I could lay my hands on.\\" Hearst's favorite dog Helen died in his arms at Wyntoon; he buried her on a hillside covered with flowers, the spot marked by a stone inscribed, \\"Here lies dearest Helen ‚Äì my devoted friend.\\" During the Wyntoon residency of Hearst and Davies, they received fewer visitors than they had at San Simeon, because it was more remote. They spent much time together, and Davies picked up sewing again after years of no practice. She sewed silk fabric into ties for Hearst. He wrote her a poem or a short note every night, which he slipped under her door for her to see in the morning. Over the 1943‚Äì1944 winter, with snow and ice transforming the outdoor scenery, Wyntoon hosted actor Clark Gable, film directors Louis B. Mayer and Raoul Walsh, columnist Louella Parsons, cartoonist Jimmy Swinnerton and his wife, aviator Charles Lindbergh and his family, the former president's daughter Anna Roosevelt and her husband John Boettiger (who worked for Hearst), and millionaire industrialist Joe Kennedy who brought his 26-year-old son \\"Jack\\", the future president. Jack surprised Hearst by swimming in the freezing McCloud.  Today  Hearst's trustees reorganized the Hearst Corporation in 1943, installing Richard E. Berlin as president. Under Berlin, Wyntoon was made to turn a profit‚Äîthe old 50,000-acre Wheeler Ranch holding and adjoining parcels adding up to were logged and replanted with more tree seedlings, the operation generating about $2 million annually by 1959. In the late 1980s, architects Blunk Demattei Associates (BDA) began working with the Hearst Corporation to complete the interior of \\"Angel House\\" whose construction had been halted in the late 1930s. BDA next began to remodel the one original bedroom wing of Polk's \\"The Bend\\". There, the second and main bedroom wing (finished in the 1950s in Tudor style) burned down on December 30, 1992, and BDA was contracted to rebuild it. Sensitive to the problem of recreating the ambiance, BDA used Sugar Pine paneling in keeping with other rooms on site, wrought iron from Poland and from local blacksmiths, stones quarried locally, and Renaissance-era fireplaces. Today, the estate is owned by the Hearst Corporation, and is not open to the public. Wyntoon is located at approximately . It is north of Lake McCloud, a man-made lake completed in 1965, and about due east of Dunsmuir, California. Energetic kayakers willing to endure dangerous rapids can view the estate from the Upper McCloud River during spring and summer snowmelt. The estate is grandfathered in the law as a \\"senior rights holder\\" to use an unlimited amount of water from the adjoining McCloud River.

Summary This film follows Sandra during one year as she travels across North America, working to break the silence about cancer and its environmental links. After a routine cancer screening, Sandra receives results that thrust her into a period of medical uncertainty. The film starts the audience on two journeys with Sandra: her private struggles with cancer and her public fight to bring attention to the human rights issue of cancer prevention. Living Downstream also follows the chemical carcinogens against which Sandra is fighting as they migrate throughout North America. The film documents interviews with scientists who believe these toxins may be working to cause cancer, and shows how chemicals enter the bodies of humans.Shipman, Shanna. \\"Documentary localizes environmental issues\\" Pekin Times, Pekin, 19 April 2010.

Because he signed a few paintings with 'Joh. Haensbergh Gorco fecit', which led some art historians to conclude he was from Gorinchem and others that he worked there for a while. Joannes van Haansbergen biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was a student of Cornelius van Poelenburgh, and though he was quite successful in imitating his master's style of landscape painting, he switched to portraits since he could make a comfortable living making flattering ladies portraits that made their skin look whiter. He became active as an art dealer, probably aided by his appointment as headman of the confrerie, where he also gave lessons, though only his son Willem Johan van Haensbergen (1680-1755), born after his second marriage to Sophia van der Snouck in 1679, is listed as his pupil.

He worked for Life magazine from 1952 to 1968, during which time 27 issues of Life carried cover photos by Shaw. Shaw's work also appeared in Esquire, Harper's Bazaar, Mademoiselle, and many other publications. He is best known for his photographs of John F. Kennedy, his wife Jacqueline Kennedy, and their children, Caroline and John F. Kennedy, Jr. In 1964, many of these images were published in the book The John F. Kennedys: A Family Album, which became a bestseller. Early life Shaw was born Mark Schlossman to working-class parents of Eastern European heritage in New York City and grew up on the Lower East Side. His mother Rebecca (or Reva) Silverstein (also Kanzer) (1895‚Äì1960) was a seamstress of Russian and Polish extraction; his father Joseph Charles Schlossman was a laborer and/or salesman of Austrian descent. They divorced while Mark was still a boy. Later he attended New York University, where he studied industrial design, and Pratt Institute, where he studied engineering and likely was exposed to photography as well. In December 1941, Shaw completed ROTC training with a lieutenant's commission. A month after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force as Mark Schlossman, recording his occupation at enlistment as \\"photographer\\". He served as a pilot throughout World War II, and was highly decorated, flying fighters with the British forces in the North African Campaign and later flying transports over The Hump from India to China. Due to his expertise with multiengine planes, he was then assigned to Russian General Georgy Zhukov as his personal pilot. Shaw also flew one of the escort planes accompanying General Douglas MacArthur on his way to Tokyo to accept the Japanese surrender. At some point during or soon after the war, Mark (and his mother) changed their surname (Schlossman) to \\"Shaw\\", probably in order to sound more \\"American\\", which was a common motivation for name changes at the time. Career After the war, Shaw began his professional photography career in New York City, managing the photographic studio at Harper's Bazaar, where he came under the influence and mentorship of art director Alexey Brodovitch. From 1946 to 1948, Shaw did fashion photography for Harper's Bazaar and began acquiring advertising clients as well. In 1949, Shaw married Geraldine \\"Geri\\" Trotta, who was a professional fashion and travel writer for several publications including Mademoiselle. The couple bought a brownstone on the East side of midtown Manhattan. Shaw established his photography studio in a carriage house behind their home. Starting in 1951, Shaw contributed fashion images to Mademoiselle. In 1952, Shaw became a freelance photographer for Life magazine and preferred freelancing throughout his career so that he could retain the rights to all of his work‚Äîa goal which he was able to achieve even with his most famous images. Trotta's connections further expanded Mark's access to celebrities and public figures, and his career flourished. Freelancing on over 100 assignments for Life, Shaw photographed many actresses, actors, politicians, and other celebrities, while also frequently working photo shoots in the fashion industry. He was the first photographer to portray the Paris fashion collections backstage in color. In 1953, probably because of his fashion experience, Shaw was assigned to photograph the young actress Audrey Hepburn during the filming of Paramount's Sabrina. Evasive at first, Hepburn became comfortable with Shaw's presence over a two-week period and allowed him to record many of her casual and private moments. This produced some of his best-known images, though most of the negatives were subsequently lost for many years. Life published several of these photos in the December 7, 1953 issue, which also carried a Shaw cover of Hepburn. Also during the 1950s, Shaw and fellow fashion and portrait photographer Richard Avedon contributed concurrently to a well-known, long-running ad campaign for Vanity Fair lingerie. Shaw won numerous Art Directors Club awards for his creative images in this campaign. By the late 1950s, Shaw's career was reaching its zenith. Among the famous figures he photographed were Brigitte Bardot, Cary Grant, Danny Kaye, Grace Kelly, Nico, Pablo Picasso, Yves St. Laurent, Elizabeth Taylor, and many others. For example, in 1957 Shaw portrayed fashion designer Coco Chanel, actress Jeanne Moreau, and model Suzy Parker during a single shoot in Chanel's Paris apartment and fashion house. Life published several of these photos with a story on Chanel that appeared in the issue of August 19, 1957 (which was also Chanel's birthday). In 1959, Life chose Shaw to photograph Jacqueline Kennedy while her husband, Senator John F. Kennedy, was running for president. This assignment was the beginning of an enduring working relationship and personal friendship with the Kennedys that would eventually lead to Shaw's acceptance as the Kennedys' de facto \\"family photographer\\". He visited them at the White House and at Hyannisport; during this time he produced his most famous photographs, portraying the couple and their children in both official and casual settings. In 1964, Shaw published a collection of these images in his book The John F. Kennedys: A Family Album, which was very successful. Late in his career Shaw also worked in film, directing numerous television commercials for major companies. Personal life In 1960, Shaw and his first wife Geri Trotta divorced. He and singer Pat Suzuki married on March 28, 1960. They had a son, David, two years later, and divorced in February 1965. Death On January 26, 1969, Shaw died at his New York City apartment. His death was initially reported as a heart attack. An autopsy later revealed that Shaw had died of \\"acute and chronic intravenous amphetamine poisoning\\". At the time of his death, Shaw was being treated by physician Dr. Max Jacobson. Nicknamed \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" and \\"Miracle Max\\", Jacobson administered \\"vitamin shots\\" that consisted of a mixture of multivitamins, steroids, animal organ cells, hormones, placenta, bone marrow, and high doses of amphetamine to a number of high-profile celebrity clients. Shaw's death drew attention to Jacobson's practice which was publicly exposed in the media in December 1972. Jacobson eventually lost his medical license in 1975. Legacy Following Shaw's death, his estate, including his large body of photographic work, passed to his ex-wives. In 1994, Shaw's son David Shaw and his wife Juliet Cuming took over management of Mark Shaw's photographic legacy and later purchased Geri Trotta's share of the collection. In 1999, they established the Mark Shaw Photographic Archive, in East Dummerston, Vermont, which is now the sole legal proprietor of Mark Shaw images. Prior to founding the Archive, David Shaw had a career as a film and music video cinematographer, and Juliet Cuming directed music videos (including White Zombie's \\"Thunder Kiss '65\\"). They have two children. The couple also operate a nonprofit, Earth Sweet Home, which promotes sustainable building and design techniques. The Archive itself is housed in an off-the-grid straw-bale structure which they built themselves following sustainable principles. The building is powered by wind and solar energy. In December 2005, a few months after Geri Trotta's death, the long-lost negatives from 60 rolls of film Mark Shaw had shot on his 1953 Audrey Hepburn assignment were found in Trotta's residence. Selections from these rediscovered images were published in 2009 in the book Charmed by Audrey: Life on the Set of Sabrina.

It depicts nineteen rusalki, who, according to Slavic mythology, were river or lake spirits who appeared at night in the form of young women. Some versions of the myths describe them as spirits who had died unbaptised or unmarried, or had drowned themselves following an unrequited love. They would emerge from the water at night, to sing and dance.

Hans Makart, Gifts of the Sea, 1870. The painting is set at night and is almost entirely without colour. The women occupy the centre mid-ground of the painting and are lit from high above the left hand of the canvas, presumably by the moon. The source of light throws shadow inconsistently. Most of the women are huddled together in a row, while some are at the edge of the bank or alone to the right seemingly lost in their own thoughts. In the left foreground the last of Kramskoi's rusalki is emerging from among the reeds, while in the background one of the women wrings out the water from her hair. The water bank is at the foot of a steep hill and surrounded by deep forest to the right. At the top of the small hill and to the right background is a small, seemingly unoccupied cabin. The subject matter and composition is likely to have been influenced by the work of the Hungarian painter and designer Hans Makart.

It flourished in the 1950s and 1960s and lasted till the early 1980s. Muslim socials are divided into two categories: \\"classic Muslim socials\\" that explore nawabi culture and focus on upper class or elite Muslim families, and \\"new wave Muslim socials\\" that portray middle class Muslim families who experience economic problems, discrimination and communal violence. Muslim socials often include ghazals, qawwalis, Urdu poetry and expressions, and musical forms commonly associated with Islamic culture. However, lately the label has also been criticized for cultural ghettoization of minority cinema. Director M.S. Sathyu who made Garam Hava (1973), called it \\"a skewed way to look at cinema. When there is no Hindu social or Christian social, how can there be a Muslim social\\". History The earliest Muslim socials were made in the 1930s after the advent of sound and continued to be popular until the 1980s. The genre's popularity was partly due to the financial success of Mehboob Khan's Najma (1943), which became the blueprint for Muslim socials that followed, which too delved on social issues around Muslim families, no matter what the setting, giving the genre its title. Based on the life of Mughal Emperor, Jahangir, Pukar (1939) made by Sohrab Modi, known for his historicals, is the first notable film in this genre. Soon Hindi cinema based in Mumbai became the hub for Muslim socials, and it employed a large number of Muslim producers, director, screenwriters, music directors, lyricists and actors, most notably Mehboob Khan, K. A. Abbas, Kamal Amrohi, Abrar Alvi, Abdul Rashid Kardar, Saadat Hassan Manto, Ismat Chugtai, Ghulam Haider, Khayyam, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Shakeel Badayuni, Mohammed Rafi, Talat Mahmood, Shamshad Begum. Numerous films were made about the Mughals, including Humayun (1945) by Mehboob Khan, Shahjehan (1946) by Abdul Rashid Kardar, Taj Mahal (1963) by M. Sadiq, and Jahan Ara (1964), however the pinnacle of this royalty theme was Mughal-e-Azam (1960) by K. Asif, about Akbar, his son Prince Salim (later known as Jahangir), and the courtesan Anarkali, who itself became the theme of other films, like Anarkali (1953).Ruthven, 189 Another popular theme of the period was centered on the nawabi culture, especially the culture of Awadh, present day Lucknow, it produced films marked by elaborate production, music and highlighting the sophistication of language and lifestyle, like Mirza Ghalib (1954), Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960), Mere Mehboob (1963), Dil Hi To Hai (1963) and Pakeezah (1972) by Kamal Amrohi, starring Meena Kumari, which spent over a decade in making. Thereafter the films in this genre shifted from regal that of fading Nawabi culture - Bahu Begum (1967). After experiencing its height in the 1970s, the genre descended to being a mere stereotypical and kitschy representation complete a kotha of a courtesan or a nawab stricken with poverty. One exception was Umrao Jaan (1981) directed by Muzaffar Ali based on 1905 historical novel Umrao Jaan Ada by Mirza Hadi Ruswa. Musical romances were also prepared in this genre which included H. S. Rawail's Mere Mehboob (1963), Mehboob Ki Mehndi (1971) and Laila Majnu (1976). More over reflecting on the changing times, themes shifted regal to middle class North Indian Muslims, and from mainstream Bollywood to parallel cinema or the new wave cinema, starting with Dastak (1970), Garm Hava (1973), Bazaar (1982) and Nikaah (1982). Besides that Ali made Anjuman (1986), and Saeed Akhtar Mirza made Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro (1989) and Naseem (1995). Gradually the genre lost both nuanced depiction of its hey days was imitated by the cinema many Muslim countries, and audiences as well, and few notable additions were made to this genre, and too sporadic. The genre resurfaced in works of the screenwriter Khalid Mohammed, Mammo (1994), Sardari Begum (1996), Fiza (2000) and Zubeidaa (2001), Mohammed directed Fiza, while the rest were directed by art film master Shyam Benegal, Benegal had previously directed, and Junoon (1978) set in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, stories with marked political content. Among recent movies, it is often wondered , should Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) be added to this glorious list of \\"Muslim Social\\" Genre, which may also be considered reflective of the current politico-social milieu of Muslims in India.

SSI organizations  The SSI consists of three major schools: Adjutant General, Financial Management, and the Recruiting and Retention Schools. It also includes the Noncommissioned Officer Academy, the 369th Adjutant General Battalion, and the Training Support Battalion. The Adjutant General and Financial Management Schools are ‚Äúhome‚Äù to their respective Army branches, the Adjutant General's Corps and the Finance Corps. The two branch schools offer the Basic Officer Leadership Course for newly commissioned lieutenants and the Captain's Career Course for first lieutenants and captains in their third or fourth year of commissioned service. The School Commandants are the proponents for their branches and oversee the development of Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Leader Development, Materiel, and Personnel within their corps (Active and Reserve Components). The Soldier Support Institute's Concepts Development & Integration Directorate and Training Development Directorate assist the Commandants with these tasks. Both schools frequently assemble Mobile Training Teams (MTTs) to go to specific geographical regions to train soldiers. The Adjutant General School also includes the Bands Program, and The Army School of Music (see United States Armed Forces School of Music) currently located at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story (JEBLCFS,) Virginia. The Interservice Postal School is also an element of the Adjutant General School which trains enlisted Soldiers and noncommissioned officers from all of America‚Äôs military services in modern postal operations. The Adjutant General School also conducts Basic Warrant Officer and Advanced Warrant Officer courses within human resources management. The Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) is located in Mabry Hall. The NCOA provides enlisted leadership training for Soldiers holding military occupational specialties in the human resource management, financial management, recruiting and retention, and religious support areas of Army operations. The 369th Adjutant General Battalion conducts Advanced Individual Training (AIT) for the Army's Human Resources Specialists and Financial Management Technicians. The Training Support Battalion consists of all Soldiers assigned to the SSI (except the 369th and NCO Academy). This organization also runs the Warrior Training Area which hosts the culminating exercise for all schools (except RRS) to apply classroom learning in a simulated operational environment. The Training Support Battalion also includes the International Student Office, which oversees the attendance of International Students to courses offered on Fort Jackson.

The clearest one is in the act of firing into another, which has lost its masts. In the foreground, a boat and wreckage float on choppy waters. Knell was born in 1801 at Carisbrooke on the Isle of Wight. By 1825 had already exhibited his works at the Royal Academy. He soon built up a successful practice as a painter of maritime and particularly naval subjects, exhibiting regularly at the Royal Academy, British Institution and the Society of British Artists. He was particularly praised in 1847 for The Battle off Cape St. Vincent, 14 February 1797, shown at Westminster Hall in 1847. It was purchased for the nation for ¬£200 and is now part of the Parliamentary Art Collection. Reviewing Knell's Destruction of Toulon, shown in the same exhibition, The Athen√¶um said: \\"It is more conspicuous in chiaroscuro treatment than most of the pictures here of its class ... a little less whiteness in the more intense portions of the fire would have given greater brilliancy. The handling is as vigorous and sketchy as the effect is powerful. Knell was twice commissioned by Queen Victoria for paintings. His picture The Arrival of Prince Albert, 6 February 1840 was bought by the prince himself and remains in the Royal Collection. It shows the packet steamer Ariel, on board which Albert came to Britain for his wedding, approaching the crowded quay at Dover in a storm. The returns of the 1861 Census record the family as living in St Pancras, London. William Adolphus, then aged 58 was married to Susan; his son William Calcott, aged 32 (b.c. 1829), was married to Maria and another son, Adolphus (b.c. 1849) was aged 12. Both William Calcott Knell and Adolphus Knell also became successful painters. He died on 9 July 1875 at his home in Kentish Town and was buried at Abney Park Cemetery. Both WA Knell and Adolphus painted a significant number of small picture of boats at dusk and in the moonlight. Many of these smaller pictures are on panel rather than on canvas which has the advantage that the harder surface allows for higher detail.

The papacy underwent important changes from 1517 to 1585 during the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation. History=Reformation Pope depicted as the Antichrist, signing and selling indulgences, from Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist The institution of the papacy underwent attacks by many Protestant reformers, including Martin Luther. Luther, who had spent time in Rome, said that Leo had vetoed a measure that cardinals should restrict the number of boys they kept for their pleasure, \\"otherwise it would have been spread throughout the world how openly and shamelessly the pope and the cardinals in Rome practice sodomy;\\" encouraging Germans not to spend time fighting fellow countrymen in defense of the papacy.; This allegation (made in the pamphlet Warnunge D. Martini Luther/ An seine lieben Deudschen, Wittenberg, 1531) is in stark contrast to Luther's earlier praise of Leo's \\"blameless life\\" in a conciliatory letter of his to the pope dated 6 September 1520 and published as a preface to his Freedom of a Christian. See on this, . Along with Luther, John Calvin, Thomas Cranmer and John Knox identified the Roman Papacy as the Antichrist. The Centuriators of Magdeburg, a group of Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg headed by Matthias Flacius, wrote the 12-volume \\"Magdeburg Centuries\\" to discredit the papacy and identify the pope as the Antichrist. The fifth round of talks in the Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue notes, :In calling the pope the \\"antichrist,\\" the early Lutherans stood in a tradition that reached back into the eleventh century. Not only dissidents and heretics but even saints had called the bishop of Rome the \\"antichrist\\" when they wished to castigate his abuse of power.See Building Unity, edited by Burgess and Gross The four most important traditions to emerge directly from the reformation were the Lutheran tradition, the Reformed/Calvinist/Presbyterian tradition, the Anabaptist tradition, and the Anglican tradition. Subsequent Protestant traditions generally trace their roots back to these initial four schools of the Reformation. It also led to the Catholic or Counter Reformation within the Roman Catholic Church. Lutherans, Reformed, Anabaptists, and Methodists all included references to the Papacy as the Antichrist in their confessions of faith: Smalcald Articles, Article four (1537) : ...the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ because he will not permit Christians to be saved without his power, which, nevertheless, is nothing, and is neither ordained nor commanded by God. This is, properly speaking to exalt himself above all that is called God as Paul says, 2 Thess. 2, 4. Even the Turks or the Tartars, great enemies of Christians as they are, do not do this, but they allow whoever wishes to believe in Christ, and take bodily tribute and obedience from Christians... Therefore, just as little as we can worship the devil himself as Lord and God, we can endure his apostle, the Pope, or Antichrist, in his rule as head or lord. For to lie and to kill, and to destroy body and soul eternally, that is wherein his papal government really consists... The Pope, however, prohibits this faith, saying that to be saved a person must obey him. This we are unwilling to do, even though on this account we must die in God's name. This all proceeds from the fact that the Pope has wished to be called the supreme head of the Christian Church by divine right. Accordingly he had to make himself equal and superior to Christ, and had to cause himself to be proclaimed the head and then the lord of the Church, and finally of the whole world, and simply God on earth, until he has dared to issue commands even to the angels in heaven...Smalcald Articles, Article 4 in the Triglot translation of the Book of Concord Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope (1537) : ...Now, it is manifest that the Roman pontiffs, with their adherents, defend [and practice] godless doctrines and godless services. And the marks [all the vices] of Antichrist plainly agree with the kingdom of the Pope and his adherents. For Paul, in describing Antichrist to the Thessalonians, calls him 2 Thess. 2, 3: an adversary of Christ, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God. He speaks therefore of one ruling in the Church, not of heathen kings, and he calls this one the adversary of Christ, because he will devise doctrine conflicting with the Gospel, and will assume to himself divine authority...Treatise on the Power and in the Triglot translation of the Book of Concord Westminster Confession (1646) : 25.6. There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ: nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is that Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition, that exalts himself in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God.; ; ; Counter-Reformation The Catholic Church did not mount an organized and deliberate response to the Protestant Reformation until the election (1534) of Pope Paul III, who placed the papacy itself at the head of a movement for churchwide reform. Pope Paul III established a reform commission, appointed several leading reformers to the College of Cardinals, initiated reform of the central administrative apparatus at Rome, authorized the founding of the Jesuits, the order that was later to prove so loyal to the papacy, and convoked the Council of Trent, which met intermittently from 1545 to 1563. The council succeeded in initiating a number of far-ranging moral and administrative reforms, including reform of the papacy itself, that was destined to define the shape and set the tone of Roman Catholicism into the mid-20th century. Such reforms included the foundation of seminaries for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life to returning orders to their spiritual foundations, and new spiritual movements focus on the devotional life and a personal relationship with Christ, including the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality. The Council of Trent Pope Paul III (1534‚Äì1549) initiated the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), a commission of cardinals tasked with institutional reform, to address contentious issues such as corrupt bishops and priests, indulgences, and other financial abuses. The Council clearly rejected specific Protestant positions and upheld the basic structure of the Medieval Church, its sacramental system, religious orders, and doctrine. It rejected all compromise with the Protestants, restating basic tenets of the Catholic faith. The Council clearly upheld the dogma of salvation appropriated by Christ lived out by faith and works. Transubstantiation, during which the consecrated bread and wine were held to become (substantially) the body and blood of Christ, was upheld, along with the Seven Sacraments. Other practices that drew the ire of Protestant reformers, such as indulgences, pilgrimages, the veneration of saints and relics, and the veneration of the Virgin Mary were strongly reaffirmed as spiritually vital as well. But while the basic structure of the Church was reaffirmed, there were noticeable changes to answer complaints that the Counter Reformers tacitly were willing to admit were legitimate. Among the conditions to be corrected by Catholic reformers was the growing divide between the priests and the flock; many members of the clergy in the rural parishes, after all, had been poorly educated. Often, these rural priests did not know Latin and lacked opportunities for proper theological training (addressing the education of priests had been a fundamental focus of the humanist reformers in the past). Parish priests now became better educated, while Papal authorities sought to eliminate the distractions of the monastic churches. Notebooks and handbooks thus became common, describing how to be good priests and confessors. Thus, the Council of Trent was dedicated to improving the discipline and administration of the Church. The worldly excesses of the secular Renaissance church, epitomized by the era of Alexander VI (1492‚Äì1503), exploded in the Reformation under Pope Leo X (1513‚Äì1521), whose campaign to raise funds in the German states to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica by supporting sale of indulgences was a key impetus for Martin Luther's 95 Theses. But the Catholic Church would respond to these problems by a vigorous campaign of reform, inspired by earlier Catholic reform movements that predated the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1417): humanism, devotionalism, legalist and the observatine tradition. The Council, by virtue of its actions, repudiated the pluralism of the Secular Renaissance Church: the organization of religious institutions was tightened, discipline was improved, and the parish was emphasized. The appointment of Bishops for political reasons was no longer tolerated. In the past, the large landholdings forced many bishops to be \\"absent bishops\\" who at times were property managers trained in administration. Thus, the Council of Trent combated \\"absenteeism,\\" which was the practice of bishops living in Rome or on landed estates rather than in their dioceses. The Council of Trent also gave bishops greater power to supervise all aspects of religious life. Zealous prelates such as Milan's Archbishop Carlo Borromeo (1538‚Äì1584), later canonized as a saint, set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards. At the parish level, the seminary-trained clergy who took over in most places during the course of the seventeenth century were overwhelmingly faithful to the church's rule of celibacy. The reign of Pope Paul IV (1555‚Äì1559) is associated with efforts of Catholic renewal. Paul IV is sometimes deemed the first of the Counter-Reformation popes for his resolute determination to eliminate all \\"heresies\\" - and the institutional practices of the Church that contributed to its appeal. Two of his key strategies were the Inquisition and censorship of prohibited books. The Inquisition, reorganized under Paul III, developed under Paul IV into an awesome instrument, even accused for Catholic cardinals Jacopo Sadoleto, Reginald Pole and Giovanni Morone, who spent several years in inquisition jail. In Calabria a bloody persecution of Waldensians was carried out. In Rome, Ignatius of Loyola was openly afraid of Paul IV. The Inquisition was most severe in Spanish controlled areas. There existed a huge difference between the Spanish inquisition and the Papal inquisition, the latter being milder and even sought after, to avoid the Spanish alternative. In this sense, his aggressive and autocratic efforts of renewal greatly reflected the strategies of earlier reform movements, especially the legalist and observantine sides: burning heretics and strict emphasis on Canon law. It also reflected the rapid pace toward absolutism that characterized the sixteenth century. While the aggressive authoritarian approach was arguably destructive of personal religious experience, a new wave of reforms and orders conveyed a strong devotional side. Devotionalism, not subversive mysticism would provide a strong individual outlet for religious experience, especially through meditation such as the reciting of the Rosary. The devotional side of the Counter-Reformation combined two strategies of Catholic Renewal. For one, the emphasis of God as an unknowable absolute ruler - a God to be feared - coincided well with the aggressive absolutism of the papacy under Paul IV. But it also opened up new paths toward popular piety and individual religious experience. The Papacy of St. Pius V (1566‚Äì1572) represented a strong effort not only to crack down against heretics and worldly abuses within the Church, but also to improve popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius V was trained in a solid and austere piety by the Dominicans. It is thus no surprise that he began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals rather than focusing on patronage. As pontiff, he practiced the virtues of a monk. Known for consoling the poor and sick, St. Pius V sought to improve the public morality of the Church, promote the Jesuits, support the Inquisition. He enforced the observance of the discipline of the Council of Trent, and supported the missions of the New World. The Spanish Inquisition, brought under the direction of the absolutist Spanish state since Ferdinand and Isabella, stemmed the growth of Protestantism in Spain before it could spread. Aftermath The pontificate of Pope Sixtus V (1585‚Äì1590) opened up the final stage of the Catholic Reformation characteristic of the Baroque age of the early seventeenth century, shifting away from compelling to attracting. His reign focused on rebuilding Rome as a great European capital and Baroque city, a visual symbol for the Catholic Church.

His two most famous books, Jewish labor in U.S.A. and The Jew and communism are considered standard works.  Early life  Epstein was born in Ruzhany, Grodno Guberniya, Imperial Russia (now in Belarus). His family was unsure of his exact birth date, but assigned him March 15, 1889, the second day of Purim.Epstein, Melech Pages from a colorful life Bloch Publishing Company 1971 pp.1-2 During his teenage years he became active in the Jewish territorialist movement. Beginning shortly before the 1905 revolution he was a cadre in the Zionist Socialist Workers Party in Bia≈Çystok, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Warsaw, Kiev and Odessa. His activities included writing for party journals, organizing unions and Jewish cultural societies and, in Bia≈Çystok manning an armed guard of the Jewish neighborhood during a pogrom. He served three intermittent periods in the Czarist prisons. Becoming dissatisfied with the ultimate aims of the territorialists he emigrated to America in 1913. He arrived at Ellis island on December 24, 1913.Epstein Pages op. cit. pp.13-48 In New York, Epstein settled in Brownsville, Brooklyn and became involved in the local Jewish radical scene. In 1915 became labor reporter for a new Yiddish daily The Day. Soon he became labor editor, which was an ideal place to observe the burgeoning Jewish labor and radical movements.Epstein Pages op. cit. pp.49, 60-63 After The Day came out in favor of foreign intervention against the Bolsheviks Epstein left the paper and joined the staff of Zeit, a Labor Zionist paper edited by David Pinsky. While working for Zeit he exposed financial improprieties involving Lucy Lang, the Forward and the United Hebrew Trades. As a result, the UHT forced his expulsion from its affiliate, the Yiddish Writers Union, which Epstein had helped to found in 1917. Despairing of mainstream union bureaucracy, he left the Socialist party in 1921, as part of the Workers Council of the United States. When this group merged with the communists to form the Workers Party of America Epstein was offered a place as labor editor on the communists' new Yiddish daily, Morgen Freiheit.Epstein Pages op. cit. pp.68-70  In the Communist Party  After a factional skirmish Epstein was made acting editor in 1923 and official editor in 1925. As editor he tried to steer the Freiheit into a more broad left direction and resisted pressures to make its content dogmatically communist. A member of the Lovestone faction within the party he resigned the editorship in spring 1929 during intense factional warfare within the party.Epstein Pages op. cit. pp.71-72 In August 1929 both Epstein and Moissaye Joseph Olgin, the new Freiheit editor were censured by the party for taking a pro-Yishuv stand in reporting on the out break of violence in Palestine. Under party pressure the paper changed its analysis reporting the revolt as a national liberation movement against the British and their Zionist collaborators. That fall Epstein was relieved of all other party offices and was sent to the Soviet Union to \\"improve his communist morale\\".Epstein Pages op. cit. p.73 He returned in 1931. No longer on the staff of Freiheit, he became educational director of the TUUL Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union and editor of its weekly Needle Worker.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.102 He was allowed to return to the Freiheit during the transition to the popular front period in the mid-1930s.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.104 In 1936 he was sent to Palestine, officially as a Freiheit correspondent, but actually as an emissary to the Palestine Communist Party. The out break of yet another revolt strained relations between the CPUSA and American Jewry. The Comintern was silent on what stance to take, so they decided to send a personal envoy to the sister party to co-ordinate strategy. Epstein learned that the party was being rapidly \\"Arabized\\" and was taking a more and militant stand against the Zionists and the Yishuv in general.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.107-117 While in Palestine Epstein learned of the out break of the Spanish Civil War. Without waiting for word from the party or Freiheit he sailed to Barcelona and became one of the first American journalists on the scene. He stayed in Spain for three months sending dispatches back to Freiheitfrom the front lines.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.118-128  Post-communist years  Melech Epstein broke with the party in August, 1939 after the Nazi-Soviet pact. This was the final event which sealed his disillusionment with the party, though he had been having misgivings for a decade since the beginning of the Third Period and then the show trials in the late 1930s.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.135-137 He went off to Mexico where he visited Leon Trotsky and Diego Riviera.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.140-143 When he came back to America he briefly joined the staff of The Forward, but was fired soon after because he wouldn't go before the Dies committee or write sensationalistic material about the Communist Party. In 1943 he was hired by the Jewish Labor Committee to go on fund raising tours for the underground Jewish resistance movement in Poland. Finally, in 1945 he became public relations director of the Cloakmakers Joint Board of ILGWU.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.148-150 In the fall of 1947 he settled in Florida.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.151 There he wrote his two major books Jewish labor in U.S.A. and The Jew and communism, independently published through a \\"Trade Union Sponsoring Committee\\" which was partly funded by ILGWU.Epstein Pages op. cit. p.165  References External links * Melech Epstein Papers at Stuart A.

This class of variables are defined as \\"helium supergiant Bp stars with weak hydrogen lines and enhanced lines of He and C\\". That is, the hydrogen spectral lines of these stars are weaker than normal for a star of stellar class B, while the lines of helium and carbon are stronger. The prototype for this category is HD 168476, also known as PV Telescopii, which undergoes small but complex luminosity variations and radial velocity fluctuations. The PV Tel stars are extremely hydrogen-deficient compared to other B-class stars and vary in luminosity on time scales ranging from a few hours to several years. As of 2008, there are twelve confirmed PV Tel variables in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. PV Telescopii variables are subdivided into three distinct types on the basis of spectral type: type I represents late B and A stars, type II represents O and early B, and type III represents F and G stars. The type III stars are always carbon-rich and hydrogen-deficient, while the type I and II stars do not necessarily have an excess of carbon. The hotter types pulsate more quickly than the cooler types. List The following list contains selected PV Telescopii variable that are of interest to amateur or professional astronomy.

The cards are intended to be used for adding a wide range of capabilities, such as A/D, D/A, digital I/O, counter/timers, serial I/O, wired or wireless networking, image processing, GPS, etc. to their host systems. FeaturePak cards plug into edgecard sockets, parallel to the mainboard, similarly to how SO-DIMM memory modules install in laptop or desktop PCs. Socket Interface The FeaturePak socket consists of a 230-pin \\"MXM\\" connector, which provides all connections to the FeaturePak card, including the host interface, external I/O signals, and power. (Note, however, that the FeaturePak specification's use of the MXM connector differs from that of Nvidia's MXM specification. ) Host interface connections include: *PCI Express -- up to two PCI Express x1 lanes *USB -- up to two USB 1.1 or 2.0 channels *Serial‚Äîone logic-level UART interface *SMBus *JTAG *PCI Express Reset *Several auxiliary signals *3V and 5V power and ground *Reserved lines (for future enhancements) The balance of the 230-pin FeaturePak socket is allocated to I/O, in two groups: *Primary I/O‚Äî50 general purpose I/O lines, of which 34 pairs have enhanced isolation *Secondary I/O‚Äî50 general purpose I/O lines The FeaturePak socket's MXM connector is claimed capable of 2.5 Gbit/s bandwidth on each pin, thereby supporting high-speed interfaces such as PCI Express, gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0, among others. Enhanced I/O signal isolation within the Primary I/O group is accomplished by leaving alternate pins on the MXM connector interface unused. FeaturePak cards are powered by 3.3V and use standard 3.3V logic levels. The socket also provides a 5V input option, for cards that require the additional voltage to power auxiliary functions. Other than the provision of extra isolation for 34 signal pairs, there is no defined allocation of the signals within the Primary I/O and Secondary I/O groups, leaving each FeaturePak to define its own utilization of the I/O signals. Consequently, there is little limitation as to what can be implemented on a FeaturePak card. Card size FeaturePak Module Dimensions Overall FeaturePak horizontal dimensions are 1.75 x 2.55 inches (43 x 65 mm). There are two options for topside component thickness: \\"tall\\" FeaturePak modules may have topside components of up to 0.4 inch (10 mm) thick; \\"standard\\" modules are limited to 0.19 inch (4.8 mm) topside component thickness. History The FeaturePak standard was launched by the FeaturePak Initiative at Embedded World 2010 in Nuremberg, Germany, in March 2010. At launch, the Initiative consisted of FeaturePak originator Diamond Systems, plus FeaturePak Initiative charter members Arbor Technology, Cogent Computer Systems, congatec, Connect Tech, Douglas Electronics, Hectronic, and IXXAT Automation. The FeaturePak Initiative subsequently was superseded by a California nonprofit corporation known as the FeaturePak Trade Association (FPTA), which assumed ownership of the FeaturePak specification and other IP (intellectual property) and became responsible for maintaining, extending, and promoting the FeaturePak standard and established restrictions and guidelines pertaining to the use of the FeaturePak trademark and logos.

Nottinghamshire. Nikolaus Pevsner They were called \\"Black Canons\\" because they wore Black Cassocks, Black Capes and Hoods. History It is thought that a priory was built at Thurgarton for its location in circa 1119. It was in a sheltered valley and had a stream and natural spring very near. It also had a good supply of wood and stone for building. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Valor Ecclesiasticus gave the clear income of ¬£259 9s. 4d. (), making it one of richer monasteries of the time. King Henry VIII granted the manor partly to Trinity College, Cambridge, and partly to William Cooper. It was lived in by the Cooper family until at the end of the 17th century the estate passed to John Gilbert, who changed name to Cooper as a condition of William Cooper's will.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1735 (9 Geo. 2). c. 27 At the end of the 18th century the owner demolished the old priory, so that nothing of it was left but the cellars, and one aisle of the old church, plus the tower, which make up the present church. The original building would have rivalled nearby Southwell Minster, having two western towers and a nave of seven bays, cloister and a large chancel, plus the monastic houses. The church was restored in 1853 by Thomas Chambers Hine. Parish registers exist from 1721; earlier records were lost in 1780. The house that replaced the Priory was used as the Bishop of Southwell's palace whilst a new one was being built next to the Cathedral in Southwell.

The line opened on 1 September 1864 with stations at Worsley, Ellenbrook, Tyldesley, Leigh and Pennington before joining the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at Kenyon Junction. Construction The London and North Western Railway Bill received Royal Assent in July 1861 and the first sod was cut at Worsley by the Earl of Ellesmere in the September. During construction, a Roman road was uncovered at Worsley. The railway was just over 16 miles long with 88 bridges, a sandstone cutting at Parr Brow, Tyldesley and a 22-arch viaduct which took the railway through Leigh and over the Bridgewater Canal. The work was expected to have been completed by May 1863 but lasted until the summer of 1864. Development Stations between Tyldesley and Wigan at Chowbent, Hindley Green and Platt Bridge opened on the same day. A branch line leaving the Tyldesley to Eccles line at Roe Green Junction with stations at Walkden, Little Hulton and Plodder Lane was authorised in 1865 and opened in 1870. The line was extended to Great Moor Street in Bolton in 1874. Monton Green station between Eccles station and Worsley station opened in 1877 to serve new housing. In 1876 Bedford Leigh was renamed Leigh & Bedford and in 1914 was again renamed to Leigh. Chowbent was renamed Howe Bridge in 1901. Stations on the line became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, and the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. Collieries Coal, and the many collieries that were being developed in the area, was the chief motivation for building a railway in the area and the railway's supporters included many local colliery owners and industrialists. These included the Earl of Ellesmere owner of the Bridgewater Collieries, the Fletchers of Fletcher, Burrows and Company and millowner Caleb Wright. Collieries linked to the railway include Astley and Tyldesley Collieries' St George's, Nook and Gin Pit Collieries which were connected at Jackson's sidings, Bedford Colliery in Leigh was connected at Speakman's sidings on the Pennington branch and the Shakerley, Yew Tree and Cleworth Hall Collieries belonging to the Tyldesley Coal Company had a connection at Green's Sidings to the east of Tyldesley station and Ramsden's Shakerley Collieries had its own sidings. Mosley Common Colliery was connected at Ellenbrook and mines connected to the Bridgewater Collieries system including Sandhole Colliery joined the line between Roe Green and Worsley at Sanderson's Sidings. Closure The Tyldesley Loopline closed following the Beeching cuts on 5 May 1969 and Leigh, Tyldesley, Monton Green and Worsley stations were closed. The former trackbed which passes through the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan area was reserved in the Unitary Development Plan in case the rail route could be reinstated. A guided bus route running along the former trackbed to Ellenbrook was proposed but was not universally popular. Salford City Council used the railway trackbed outside the Wigan boundary for recreational purposes turning it into a rail trail. The Leigh-Salford-Manchester Bus Rapid Transit opened in April 2016. Its 4.5-mile guided busway section from Leigh via Tyldesley to Ellenbrook operates along the old rail alignment. Of Transport for Greater Manchester‚Äôs (TfGM) ¬£122m overall spending on the bus route to Manchester Central Hospitals via the city centre, ¬£68m was spent on the guided busway track and associated infrastructure.
