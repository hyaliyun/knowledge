This is the only living species of the genus Hemiphlebia and the family Hemiphlebiidae. The oldest representative of the family is Enteropia mongolica from the Late Jurassic (Tithonian) Shar Teeg Beds of Mongolia. Distribution and habitat The ancient greenling has been recorded from a small number of scattered sites, including on King Island and in Mount William, Tasmania; in Wilsons Promontory National Park and near Yea, Victoria; and in Piccaninnie Ponds Conservation Park in south-eastern South Australia. Its recorded habitat includes permanent freshwater ponds, riverine lagoons and swamps that may dry out seasonally. A favoured site discovered in 2008, Long Swamp in the Discovery Bay Coastal Park of south-western Victoria, contains extensive areas of twig-rush (Baumea sp.) which is seasonally flooded but dries out by late summer Conservation The greenling's conservation status was raised from Vulnerable to Endangered in 2008 because of the limited area of habitat occupied, as well as the small and scattered character of the populations, at least some of which were in decline.

However, at the time there already existed a genus of beetle also named Ictinus described by Fran√ßois Laporte in 1834. In 1934, John Cowley, an English entomologist, renamed this species to Ictinogomphus in deference to Rambur's original name. Cowley is now regarded as the authority, and this genus can be formally written as: Ictinogomphus . The Australian Faunal Directory considers the genus Ictinogomphus to belong to the family Lindeniidae. The World Odonata List at Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound considers the genus Ictinogomphus to belong to the family Gomphidae.

Plot One night in Lankhmar, the Gray Mouser and Fafhrd are summoned by their patron wizards, Ningauble of the Seven Eyes and Sheelba of the Eyeless Face, who have joined forces, to carry out a mission. They are required to enter the Plaza of Dark Delights and obliterate a bazaar that has been established there by the Devourers, alien merchants who magically mesmerize customers into buying high priced merchandise which is actually worthless junk. However, Mouser arrives before him and is enticed into the bazaar. Fafhrd, aided only by the Blindfold of True Seeing and the Cloak of Invisibility, given to him by the wizards, must perform the mission alone. This he does, battling not only an entranced Mouser, but reanimated skeletons and living statues, against which his weapons are all but useless. But he manages to escape and rescue Mouser, still mesmerized into thinking that the junk he sees is really valuable, including books of ancient spells.

Early life Le Noir was born in Bryan, Texas but spent his early years in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, part of the New Orleans metropolitan area. As a teenager, Le Noir's family returned to Texas, settling in Arlington. Le Noir graduated with a Bachelor of Science in criminal justice from the University of Texas at Arlington. Le Noir himself credits his career in the law enforcement field to his father. Aside from serving in the military, Le Noir's father was a heavyweight professional boxer who was a natural \\"protector\\" of not only his family and friends, but of anyone he felt was being abused or mistreated. Police career Le Noir joined the Arlington Police Department in 1980 in the patrol division and in two years earned a spot in the narcotics division and focused on undercover work. Three years later, Le Noir was selected to join the homicide division and was responsible for securing numerous capital convictions. During his distinguished law enforcement career, Le Noir has earned 75 commendations, 11 departmental awards, his Master Police Officer State Certification and the honor of \\"Officer of the Year.\\" A black belt in martial arts since 1975, Le Noir pioneered the Arlington Police Academy's now required program in defensive tactics. He is also a certified instructor in basic and advanced courses in homicide investigation to outside police agencies at the North Texas Regional Police Academy and lectures extensively at colleges, high schools, civic groups and events and citizen police academies throughout the state. Several of Le Noir's homicide cases have earned national media attention ‚Äì having been featured on A&E;'s Cold Case Files, Dick Wolf's Arrest & Trial and Court TV's Forensic Files among others. One of Le Noir's most famous cases was that of serial killer Jack Reeves, which has been featured in eight different documentary programs including HBO's America Undercover: Autopsy series and the subject of the book Mail Order Murder by true crime author Patricia Springer. Presently, Le Noir continues to investigate homicides in the Cold Case Homicide Unit. He is often called on to teach homicide investigation at the regional police academy, and lecture at universities while pursuing a second career in the entertainment venue. He has served in a consulting capacity on such shows as Rescue 911, and as the host for Murder, a Bunim-Murray Production that premiered on Spike TV in 2007.

They are used for custody or fiscal transfer. It also audits changes that have been made to any of the parameters required to turn the raw flow meter data into volumes. It records events and alarms related to the flow meter (for example, loss of flow, loss of required electrical signals from measurement transducers, or transition of these electrical signals near their upper or lower range). It keeps a running tally of the volume for each flow meter it monitors and creates a record of this volume on an hourly, daily, batch or monthly basis. The flow data is made available externally through an electronic interface so that other computers can download the information for supervision, accounting and auditing. See also API MPMS Chapter 21‚ÄîChapters 21.1 - Electronic Gas Systems, and Chapter 21.2 - Liquid Electronic Systems address the ability to audit and verify the information produced by a flow computer, and defines the data which a flow computer should retain, the items which should be audited if modified, the reports which the system will be capable of producing and the methodologies to follow. Algorithms one can expect to see implemented in a typical gas flow computer are AGA Report No. 3, AGA Report No. 7, AGA Report No. 8 in the U.S. market. Internationally, ISO 5167-1:2003 and other ISO gas standard equivalents are in widespread use. Additional to natural gas, some flow computers offer an array of density calculations for steam, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and ethylene. Complex algorithms and Equations of State for wide ranges of hydrocarbon fluids and petrochemicals can also be found in liquid flow computers. API MPMS Chapter 11.1 (2004), NIST 1045 and IUPAC for ethylene measurement, GPA TP-27 for LPGs and NGLs are amongst an array of calculations performed by liquid flow computers. Other corrections specific to particular types or manufacturers of flow meters may also be implemented. Flow computers can include meter viscosity linearization functions for various meter types such as helical turbine meters, and interface serially with ultrasonic meters to obtain flow and diagnostic data. Flow computers are available as completely programmable devices using a variety of software tools or as configurable devices using manufacturer's specific configuration software packages to set up interfaces to gas chromatographs, gas ultrasonic meters, liquid provers, flow control valves, PLC, DCS, SCADA and industry-recognized HMI supervisory systems. Modbus/TCP is a standard offering via Ethernet interfaces from some flow computers, although other communications protocols, such as OLE are supported by some flow computers. Security issues are very significant in SCADA system development using flow computers. A key component in custody transfer systems, flow computers can be approved to metrological and quality standards such as OIML R117-1 for liquids, EN12405 for gas, WELMEC 7.2 for software development, and ISO 9001:2008. These are considered key selection criteria for flow computers that are installed in Europe, Middle East, Asia and also Latin America.

Biology This damselfly is about 2.5 centimeters long. The male is mostly black with blue sides on the thorax and blue dots toward the tip of the abdomen. The female has dull green coloration on the sides of the thorax. This species is similar to Ischnura denticollis, and can be distinguished by the shape of the male genital appendages. The two species are thought to hybridize. This damselfly is active between March and November, and adults are known to live over 30 days, a relatively long adult life for damselflies. This species occurs in coastal regions of the Bay Area; it is thought that its long life and long flight season are adaptations to the foggy climate of the region.Garrison, R. W. and Hafernik, J. E. (1981). Population structure of the rare damselfly, Ischnura gemina (Kennedy) (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). Oecologia 48(3) 377-84. The natural habitat of the species is the various wetland ecosystems of the San Francisco Bay Area, including seepages and ponds. It can tolerate some disturbance, such as channelization of waterways, as long as there is marshy vegetation cover. The larvae develop in the cover of aquatic plants and the adults feed on other wetland arthropods. Ecology Populations of this damselfly have been extirpated due to the destruction and degradation of habitat in the heavily urbanized area where it occurs. It lived in wetland habitat in Glen Canyon Park in the city of San Francisco until these moist spots were fragmented too extensively to support populations. After patches of wetland in the park were restored, the damselfly was reintroduced and persisted for a short while before disappearing once more. Though the reintroduction failed, it provided data about the habitat requirements for the insect.Hannon, E. R. and Hafernik, J. E. (2007). Reintroduction of the rare damselfly Ischnura gemina (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) into an urban California park. Journal of Insect Conservation 11(2) 141-49. This had been designated an endangered species on the IUCN Red List because of its very small range, small populations within that range, and extensive destruction of its habitat. It has been downgraded to vulnerable status because it has been located at a few more sites, it has good dispersal ability, and it is relatively resistant to some of the forms of habitat degradation that it faces, such as pollution.

He was the co-creator (with Michael G. Moye) of the American television show Married... with Children. The show's 259 episodes over 11 seasons made it the second-longest lasting sitcom on the Fox network. Life and career Raised in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, Leavitt began his television career in the 1970s writing episodes for the comedies Bustin' Loose, Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Bad News Bears (for which he garnered an NAACP award). In the early 1980s, in addition to writing and producing The Jeffersons (for which he won a People's Choice Award and a second NAACP award), Leavitt co-wrote the pilot for Silver Spoons and co- created and executive produced the Jason Bateman sitcom It's Your Move. In the late 1980s, Leavitt co-created Married... with Children, which, with its debut on the Fox network in 1987, broke many of the established rules and mores of television. He served as executive producer and wrote or co-wrote close to 150 episodes. Its longevity over 11 seasons made Married... with Children the second-longest running sitcom on Fox, just behind The Simpsons. Among its industry honors, Married... with Children earned seven Emmy nominations and an equal number of Golden Globe nominations, including Best TV Series. The show became a springboard for Leavitt to create a number of spin-offs, initially Top of the Heap, starring Matt LeBlanc and Joseph Bologna, and Vinnie & Bobby, starring Matt LeBlanc and Robert Torti. He subsequently co-created, executive produced, and wrote Unhappily Ever After. In more recent years, Leavitt created and wrote several episodes of the WB's The Help. Other achievements outside television include recognition by the State of California as Citizen Hero of the Year in 2001, and the equally notable accomplishment of out-eating wrestler King Kong Bundy in a cheesesteak sandwich-eating contest at Dominick's Kitchen while Bundy was guest-starring on Married... with Children. He had two children, Matt and Samantha. He also had long-time partner, Jessica Hahn. He died on February 10, 2008, from lung cancer.

Much of the route is built to expressway or freeway standards. Route description First reassurance marker in Minnesota north of the Iowa state line Saint Peter Minnetonka, looking north U.S. 169 enters Minnesota near Elmore as a two-lane, undivided highway, continuing as such through the majority of Blue Earth. Near the northern outskirts of the town, it expands to a four-lane, divided highway, subsequently crossing Interstate Highway 90. Soon after, it reverts to its original two-lane size. Roughly 5 miles southwest of Mankato, U.S. 169 and State Highway 60 merge to a single expressway through Mankato. In North Mankato, Highway 60 moves from a concurrency with U.S. 169 to another one with U.S. 14. In Mankato and North Mankato, U.S. 169 functions as an arterial highway, passing directly through the cities' downtown area. From Mankato north to Shakopee, the route remains an expressway, except for the section passing through Saint Peter, where U.S. 169 is the main street through town. of U.S. 169 from Saint Peter to I-494 in Bloomington is officially designated the John A. Johnson Memorial Highway. This includes the Bloomington Ferry Bridge between Shakopee and Bloomington. This designation is marked as \\"Johnson Memorial Drive\\" on some maps, but not marked as such on directional signs, nor commonly known by this name. In the Twin Cities area, the route is constructed to freeway standards between County Road 69 in Shakopee and State Highway 610 in Brooklyn Park. The freeway between Interstate 494 and Interstate 694 was originally built by Hennepin County as County Road 18. In 1988, County Road 18 was transferred to the state of Minnesota and became the new alignment for Highway 169 in the Minneapolis area. In exchange, Hennepin County took over maintenance of two other highways that were formerly state routes. In the Minneapolis area, U.S. 169 is often congested, but the freeway passes close to residential neighborhoods in many locations, so any expansion of the freeway would disrupt housing stock in the surrounding area. North of MN 610, 169 remains an expressway until Anoka, where it becomes a street. It then joins U.S. 10 west to Elk River. Those highways diverge at Babcock Wayside on the Mississippi River. North of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, U.S. 169 continues as an expressway to Mille Lacs Lake, an important resort area. The highway skirts the western shore of the lake. of U.S. 169 from Elk River to Garrison is officially designated the POW / MIA Memorial Highway. From Mille Lacs Lake, U.S. 169 continues northward to its junction with U.S. 2 at Grand Rapids. Here, 169 turns northeasterly to reach the cities of the Mesabi Iron Range. At the eastern end of Grand Rapids, U.S. 169 becomes an expressway and remains such for 8 miles. An additional 1.5 miles, from Taconite to Itasca County Road 7; will be complete in 2016. It passes through the cities of Hibbing, Chisholm, and Mountain Iron before reaching U.S. 53 at the city of Virginia. This four-lane stretch of 169 is also known as the Highway 169 Cross Range Expressway. The northern terminus of U.S. 169 is at the city of Virginia. State Highway 169 begins immediately north of Virginia in Wuori Township; and continues northeast for to the cities of Tower, Ely, and Winton. State Highway 169 is numbered as an extension of U.S. 169. U.S. 169 is one of three Minnesota U.S. marked highways to carry the same number as an existing state marked highway within the state. The others being Highways 61 and 65. Legally, the Minnesota section of U.S. 169 is defined as all or part of Routes 5, 7, 383, 3, 18, and 35 in the Minnesota Statutes ¬ß¬ß 161.114(2) and 161.117(4)., The route is not marked with those numbers. History Exit numbers started appearing in Shakopee in 2016 U.S. 169 was extended into Minnesota circa 1931. The route in Minnesota was paved by 1940. U.S. 169, between the junction with State Highway 60 (south of Mankato) and the Twin Cities, was upgraded to at least expressway status over several stages. The freeway section around Mankato and the adjoining expressway sections were completed in the early 1960s, along with bypasses of Le Sueur, Jordan and Belle Plaine. The U.S. 169 freeway bypass around Shakopee was built in the mid-1990s along a new alignment, which included the newly constructed Bloomington Ferry Bridge. Prior to this realignment, U.S. 169 crossed the Minnesota River from downtown Shakopee where it had been co-signed with State Highway 101. North of the river crossing, U.S. 169 had previously been co-signed with what was then U.S. 212 (Flying Cloud Drive) through Eden Prairie until 1996. A new U.S. 169 interchange with State Highway 19, near Henderson, was completed in 2002. An expressway section of Highway 169 through southern Hennepin County was converted to full freeway in 2006, with new interchanges constructed at Pioneer Trail and Anderson Lakes Parkway. At-grade intersections with traffic signals have been removed at the recently constructed Interstate 494 interchange, which was previously a point of frequent congestion. North of the Twin Cities, Highway 169 has been upgraded to an expressway between Elk River and the southern end of Mille Lacs Lake, with bypasses of Princeton and Milaca built in the late 1980s. U.S. 169 between Hill City and Grand Rapids has been built to super-2 standards. The expressway section between Pengilly and the city of Virginia was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 2008, construction began on a new Highway 169 interchange with County Road 81 and 85th Avenue North in Brooklyn Park. This interchange is also known as The Devil's Triangle, or simply as \\"The Triangle\\", because of the major traffic congestion during rush hour, especially in the afternoon. Construction was completed on August 11, 2011. During the flooding of September 2010, flood waters destroyed a 150-foot section of the northbound lanes of Highway 169 between St. Peter and Le Sueur. MnDOT believes, \\"when the flood waters rose up it found a weak spot in the slope or the dirt bank and got under the grass and started mining under the pavement. Finally, it just sucked all the dirt out and the pavement just dropped into a hole.\\" Traffic was detoured to the southbound lanes of 169 for a month, resulting in a temporary two lane expressway, until the northbound section was repaired. In November 2010, construction began on a completely redesigned Highway 169 interchange at Interstate 494, where three traffic signals had existed. The new interchange features six roundabouts, new flyover bridges, and two new bridges over I-494 that will carry West 78th Street and Washington Avenue. Major construction began in March 2011. Construction continued in spring 2012 with the completion of reconstructing surrounding roads and remaining ramps. MnDOT completed the entire project in November 2012. The 2010 cost of the construction project was $140 million.http://www.ci.bloomington.mn.us/cityhall/dept/pubworks/engineer/streets/curr_proj/th169/th169.htm http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/projects/169/ In 2016, exit numbers have started appearing on the Shakopee portion of the freeway section in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metro area. Future A study to convert U.S. 169 to a freeway between U.S. 10 in Elk River to 277th Avenue north of Zimmerman was completed in late 2009. A complete review of the project by MnDOT will occur in 2011. A complete construction schedule and timeline will then by released by MnDOT. Allocation of funds for the project is currently underway and the only thing holding back from starting the project. The project is expected to cost around $178 Million. In the meantime, the 14 miles between U.S. 10 in Elk River to 277th Avenue north of Zimmerman will be resurfaced during the 2012 construction season. The construction will begin in May 2012.http://projects.dot.state.mn.us/srf/169elkriver/index.html Major intersectionsSee also * * References 69-1 Minnesota Category:Transportation in Faribault County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Blue Earth County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Nicollet County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Sibley County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Le Sueur County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Scott County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Hennepin County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Anoka County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Sherburne County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Mille Lacs County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Aitkin County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Crow Wing County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Itasca County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in St. Louis County, Minnesota ","title":"U.S. Route 169 in Minnesota"},{"id":"12702925","text":"Uyunqimg or Oyunchimeg (; born December 1942) is a retired Chinese politician of Mongolian ethnicity.

A tattoo cover-up is the act of tattooing over a previously unwanted tattoo with a new tattoo. It is usually seen as being one of two options of removing an unwanted tattoo; the other option being laser removal. Covering up an unwanted tattoo is generally cheaper than tattoo removal. Poorly applied, faded, or light tattoos are the easiest to cover and can only be covered up using the same or darker ink. White ink may sometimes be applied to lighten the old tattoo before proceeding with the cover-up. Cover-ups could completely hide the old tattoo with a new design, or the cover-up could incorporate elements or the whole of the existing tattoo. The new ink being deposited over the old ink is combining together to create a new color which is why it is easier to use black ink for most cover-ups. The focus is on the color of the existing tattoo and how to incorporate the new color and best conceal the tattoo. Cover-up designs will always be bigger in size compared the to previous design as it helps to hide the design completely. A cover-up is not a new tattoo as some of the previous tattoo is still visible. Find an experienced tattoo artist is highly suggested because the cover-up process is time-consuming and requires effort. Invest time and do your research to find an artist best at concealing. Remember, some tattoo artists refuse to do a cover-up as well as they want do not want to tattoo their art on previously inked skin. There are a few tricks that tattoo artists have learned along the way in quick and effective cover-ups. For example, keeping the cover-up design close to the old design, fading a tattoo by removing excess ink, and strengthening weak lines are just a few tricks. When researching tattoo artists take a look at their portfolio and previous tattoo work which can be accessed directly from the artist at their shop or on their own social media platforms. Some artists will directly let you know when you reach out to them if they do cover-up tattoos or not. Also, take a look at the type of style of each artist as there are many different types such as new school, traditional, watercolor, portrait and realism which are only a few examples. White-Out Technique Nowadays, it is possible to cover a dark tattoo with white ink. Artists use a technique known as the white-out technique. In this technique, white ink is used over the dark-colored tattoo to lighten it up. This technique is now commonly used by utilizing the best quality white inks to cover up the previous tattoo. The combination of white and black tattoo inks shouldn‚Äôt be ignored when trying out this technique.

Improvisation Advisor  The philosophy of Impro-Visor is to provide a tool to help musicians construct jazz solos over chord progressions. It includes a database capability for creating, saving, and recalling licks, as well as a lick generation capability based on a user-modifiable grammar. More recent versions of Impro-Visor include auto-generated playback accompaniment in various styles, and a style extraction (from MIDI) capability. Most musical knowledge, including lick generation, database, lead sheets, styles, and other information, is represented as text files, permitting the tool to be customized.  Leadsheet Notation  Rendering Leadsheet Notation Impro-Visor saves lead sheets in a textual notation, and lead sheets may be created from that notation as well as by point-and-click. The notation was designed to be friendly to the jazz musician, by resembling directly what appears on the lead sheet staff. For example, the lead sheet fragment to the right, similar to that in article lead sheet, can be created by the following text: > \` C C7  F  > c+2 bb2 bb8 a8 f2. \` The reading of this text is: Chords C and C7 equally spaced in the first bar, and F in the second bar. A melody of c (the + means an octave above middle C, the 2 means a half-note), bb2, meaning a B-flat half-note, bb8, meaning a B-flat eighth-note, f2., meaning an F dotted half-note. Other meta-data can be supplied, such as for style specification, but is not required.  Tone Categorization  Using colors for tone categories Impro-Visor categorizes tones that can be played over any chord into one of four categories. This serves two purposes: (i) as visual feedback to the user, where each category is rendered as a different color, and (ii) as a basis for lick generation. The categories are: * Chord tones: tones that are in the chord, and which are thus the most consonant with it (shown as black on the right) * Color tones: tones that are not in the chord, but which are also consonant with it (shown as green on the right) * Approach tones: tones that are neither of the above, but which approach one of the above chromatically (shown as blue on the right) * Other tones: none of the above (shown as red on the right) The idea is that, aided by visual clues, the musician can learn to appreciate the degree to which a melody will be sonorous over a chord progression prior to hearing it.  Grammatical Lick Generation  Lick generated using grammar to produce notes Categories of notes discussed above are one of the key ingredients in automating the generation of melodies, which can be used by the musician in constructing solos. The other key ingredient is a context-free grammar having terminal symbols for each of the four categories, along with a few other terminal symbols for convenience. The grammar defines ways in which the melody space can be filled probabilistically by tones of various durations. By associating a probability with each grammar rule, the distribution of generated melodies can be controlled, for example to create melodies that are simple or complex, relatively consonant or dissonant, etc. The user indicates the chord progression, and the grammar drives the melody generation over that progression. The figure at the right demonstrates an example generated lick. This particular grammar is constructed so as not to produce any discordant notes (notes in the \\"other\\" category above), thus no red notes appear in the figure.  Grammar Learning  Version 4 added a feature for learning a grammar from a corpus of transcribed solos. The learned grammar loosely approximates the playing style of the soloist by creating abstract melodies from the solos, which can be re-instantiated into similar melodies through the grammar. Connections between learned abstract melodic fragments are represented as a Markov chain, which is encoded into the stochastic context- free grammar.  Auto-Accompaniment  Impro-Visor automatically creates accompaniment, such as piano, bass, and drums, from the chord sequence on a leadsheet (a capability similar to, but currently not as full-featured as that of Band-in-a-Box). The style of accompaniment is derived from a set of pattern specifications using a textual notation similar to that for melodies. For example, a ride cymbal pattern common to swing jazz would be notated as > \` x4 x8 x8 x4 x8 x8 \` with x4 signifying a quarter-note hit and x8 an eighth-note hit. The swung note aspect, wherein eighth-notes on the beat get approximately twice the value of the beat, is rendered automatically by a numeric swing parameter, such as .67, which indicates that the beat is divided as .67 + .33 = 1. A similar pattern notation is used for chord comping and bassline patterns. In the latter type of pattern, a note category coding scheme similar to that for the grammatical notation is used to provide probabilistic creation of basslines.  Roadmaps and Analysis of Chord Progressions  Roadmap produced by Impro-Visor Impro-Visor analyzes jazz lead sheets to produce a roadmap of the tune. A roadmap is a sequence of bricks that represent harmonic idioms. The nomenclature for this approach is derived from that of Conrad Cork and John Elliott.

Positive displacement (PD) flow meters measure the volumetric flow rate of a moving fluid or gas by dividing the media into fixed, metered volumes (finite increments or volumes of the fluid). A basic analogy would be holding a bucket below a tap, filling it to a set level, then quickly replacing it with another bucket and timing the rate at which the buckets are filled (or the total number of buckets for the ‚Äútotalized‚Äù flow). With appropriate pressure and temperature compensation, the mass flow rate can be accurately determined. A positive displacement flowmeter of the oval gear type. Fluid forces the meshed gears to rotate; each rotation corresponds to a fixed volume of fluid. Counting the revolutions totalizes volume, and the rate is proportional to flow. These devices consist of a chamber(s) that obstructs the media flow and a rotating or reciprocating mechanism that allows the passage of fixed-volume amounts. The number of parcels that pass through the chamber determines the media volume. The rate of revolution or reciprocation determines the flow rate. There are two basic types of positive displacement flow meters. Sensor- only systems or transducers are switch-like devices that provide electronic outputs for processors, controllers, or data acquisition systems. Complete sensor systems provide additional capabilities such as an integral display and/or user interface. For both types of positive displacement flow meters, performance specifications include the minimum and maximum measurable flow rate, operating pressure, temperature range, maximum allowable material viscosity, connection size, and percent accuracy (typically as a percentage of actual reading, not full scale). Suppliers indicate whether devices are designed to measure fluid or gas.

Each stroke represents a finite measurement of the fluid (can be a single or multi-piston device). Gear Gear flow meters rely on internal gears rotating as fluid passes through them. There are various types of gear meters named mostly for the shape of the internal components ; Oval gear: Two rotating oval gears with synchronized teeth ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù a finite amount of fluid through the meter for each revolution. With oval gear flow meters, two oval gears or rotors are mounted inside a cylinder. As the fluid flows through the cylinder, the pressure of the fluid causes the rotors to rotate. As flow rate increases, so does the rotational speed of the rotors. ; Helical gear: Helical gear flow meters get their name from the shape of their gears or rotors. These rotors resemble the shape of a helix, which is a spiral-shaped structure. As the fluid flows through the meter, it enters the compartments in the rotors, causing the rotors to rotate. Flowrate is calculated from the speed of rotation. Nutating disk A disk mounted on a sphere is ‚Äúwobbled‚Äù about an axis by the fluid flow and each rotation represents a finite amount of fluid transferred. A nutating disc flow meter has a round disc mounted on a spindle in a cylindrical chamber. By tracking the movements of the spindle, the flow meter determines the number of times the chamber traps and empties fluid. This information is used to determine flow rate. Rotary vane A rotating impeller containing two or more vanes divides the spaces between the vanes into discrete volumes and each rotation (or vane passing) is counted. : Flow = volume of measuring chamber √ó RPM √ó 4 Diaphragm Fluid is drawn into the inlet side of an oscillating diaphragm and then dispelled to the outlet. The diaphragm oscillating cycles are counted to determine the flow rate. Advantages and considerations Positive displacement flowmeters are very accurate and have high turndown. They can be used in very viscous, dirty and corrosive fluids and essentially require no straight runs of pipe for fluid flow stream conditioning though pressure drop can be an issue. They are widely used in the custody transfer of oils and liquid fluids (gasoline) and are applied on residential home natural gas and water metering. A diaphragm meter, with which most homes are equipped, is an example of a positive displacement meter. This type of meter is appealing in certain custody transfer flow applications where it is critical that the metering be functional in order for any flow to take place. Positive displacement flowmeters, with internal wiping seals, produce the highest differential pressure (and subsequently greatest pressure drop head loss) of all the flowmeter types. Meters that rely on a liquid seal create a relatively low pressure drop. Positive-displacement (PD) meters can measure both liquids and gases. Like turbine meters, PD flow meters work best with clean, non-corrosive, and non-erosive liquids and gases, although some models will tolerate some impurities. Because of their high accuracy, PD meters are widely used at residences to measure the amount of gas or water used. Other applications include: chemical injection, fuel measurement, precision test stands, high pressure, hydraulic testing, and similar precision applications.http://www.maxmachinery.com/flow-measurement- industries Some designs require that only lubricating fluid be measured, because the rotors are exposed to the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they handle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe.David W. Spitzer, Industrial Flow Measurement (3rd Edition) ISA, (2005) Chapter 15. Positive displacement flow meters can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type flow meters. However, a positive displacement meter can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, magnetic or vortex flow meters.

The animal is found in several regions of California, including the Central Coast, Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, and southern Sierra Nevada foothills. The southeastern Sacramento Valley contains about 15% of the remaining vernal pool grassland habitat in the state, and it has about 35% of the known occurrences of L. packardi. 28% of all occurrences are in Sacramento County, California. Other areas with occurrences include the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, several preserves in Tehama County, and the vicinity of the cities of Chico, Redding, and Red Bluff. It has been noted at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Travis Air Force Base, and the Jepson Prairie Preserve. In the San Joaquin Valley it has been noted at the Merced and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges. There are occurrences in the Sierra foothills region in Tulare, Fresno, Merced, and Stanislaus Counties.USFWS. Lepidurus packardi Five-year Review. September 2007. It occurs outside California in the Agate Desert of Oregon. Description Lepidurus packardi is about long. It has a shield-like carapace up to long. It has compound eyes, up to 48 pairs of phyllopods (swimming appendages), and two cercopods, pincer- like appendages at the end of its telson, or tail segment. It is similar to,Lepidurus packardi. The Nature Conservancy. but distinct from, the related species Lepidurus couesii. The sexes can be distinguished by noting the egg sacs attached to the eleventh phyllopods of the female. The adult is omnivorous, collecting food items with its phyllopods as it swims, climbs on vegetation, or digs in sediment. It is an ecosystem engineer in that it causes bioturbation, producing so much turbidity when it digs through the sediment that it may alter the ecology of its pool habitat by reducing plant cover. Reproduction occurs when temporary pools fill with water. Larger females have higher fecundity, the clutch size ranging from eight to 61 eggs. The eggs can withstand a period of desiccation when the pool is dry; they will then hatch within three weeks of the pool refilling, often much more quickly. Desiccation is not required for hatching, however. The larva hatches as a metanauplius. It undergoes ecdysis, or molting, several times, growing more phyllopods each time. L. packardi takes about 38 days to mature, reproduces around its 54th day of life, and lives about 144 days. It is sexually mature when it is in carapace length. Fecundity is much reduced in individuals which are infested with a parasitic echinostome fluke. Conservation Lepidurus packardi is a federally listed endangered species of California and the United States and on the IUCN RedList in . IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (ver 2.3): Lepidurus packardi . accessed 27 April 2017. Threats to L. packardi include anything that destroys, degrades, or fragments its ephemeral pool habitat. Nine percent of historical vernal pool habitat remains today, and it is fragmented and isolated. Expanding urban development is the cause of habitat destruction in many areas. Agricultural development is another cause. The construction of the University of California, Merced, campus was scheduled to alter the habitat in the area, but it also included plans for protection of over . Habitat can also be degraded when the local hydrology is altered, making the land too dry or permanently wet. There are many local conservation projects tailored to the needs of each region.

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters. The 21st Division was again renamed the 21st Infantry Division and its initial wartime organization was as follows:Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle *41. Infanterie-Brigade: **1.

During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, the engineer contingent was increased, and a divisional signals command was created. The 21st Infantry Division's order of battle on April 28, 1918, was as follows: *42. Infanterie-Brigade: **F√ºsilier-Regiment von Gerdsdorff (1.

The college is a further and higher education college in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. History=Origins The origin and identity of Doncaster College can be traced back to the early history of technical education in the area. From about 1870, further education was delivered at a variety of small locations within the town. It all started through two evening classes in Great Northern Science and Art, taught by Mr L H Branston, who was a school master by day and artist by night. These classes were held in the St James‚Äô School (or the great Northern Railway School). The first subjects taught were freehand and perspective drawing and machine construction. The Science and Art department at South Kensington ran the courses until education responsibility was taken over by West Riding County Council in 1887. Doncaster Technical College Following national legislation, changed technical education arrangements culminated in the appointment of the first Principal of Doncaster Technical College, George Grace. At the time he said: \\"To the man with scientific knowledge and tastes the world grows more beautiful day by day: as his knowledge gets deeper and deeper. Nature offers ever-increasing sources of delight.\\" Doncaster Technical College began the development of a centre dedicated to Science, Art and Technology, which would open in 1915 as Church View, a building erected next to St George's Minster. Doncaster College of Education In 1947, around 4,850 students were enrolled on 985 classes and the College was running out of room and needed expansion. Church view was expanded yet again but it was obvious more needed to be done. The house and gardens at High Melton were converted to a Teacher Training Centre, known as Doncaster College of Education. It was founded by the County Borough of Doncaster Education Authority and was a constituent college of the Sheffield University Institute of Education. It had been the residence of an 18th- century Dean of York, John Fountayne, who is buried in the church there. Much of the building dates from this period, and was owned by the Montagu family. The campus came complete with on-site halls of residence for students and 126 acres of idyllic countryside. Doncaster LEA bought the land for ¬£10,300. The High Melton campus was officially opened in 1952. Waterdale campus Post- war demands on the College were so great the Church View could no longer cope by itself. Work started on an ambitious development at Waterdale in the centre of town. Some 6,300 students enrolled at various sites. Waterdale opened and became the headquarters of Doncaster Technical College in 1961. Church View remained as the specialist Arts Centre of the College. The estimated cost of development was ¬£1.3million. Developments=The Hub campus After three years of extensive planning, College managers were given the go-ahead by Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council to build a new, state-of-the-art campus on the town‚Äôs waterfront. The College released details of the new building ‚Äì it was to be the flagship building for Doncaster‚Äôs waterfront regeneration area and cover 33,500 sq ft. The Hub, located on Chappell Drive in Doncaster, officially opened in September 2006. At the same time, the Church View and Waterdale campuses were closed to the public. University Centre Doncaster 2004 saw Doncaster College establish its University Centre at the High Melton campus in partnership with the University of Hull. This is regarded as the first step toward a University of Doncaster. A planned \\"Review of College Higher Education\\" was conducted by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) on 30 April‚Äì2 May 2013. The QAA review team formed the following judgements about the higher education provision at Doncaster College. * The academic standards of the awards the College offers on behalf of its awarding bodies meet UK expectations for threshold standards. * The quality of student learning opportunities at the College meets UK expectations. * The quality of information produced by the College about its learning opportunities meets UK expectations. * The enhancement of student learning opportunities at the College meets UK expectations. The QAA review team identified the following features of good practice at Doncaster College: * The way in which the College has developed a distinct identity and ethos for its higher education provision, including the emphasis on staff scholarship and research. * The high quality of the placement handbook for the BA (Hons) Early Childhood Studies and the Relate Institute Code of Practice on Placement Learning. In 2017, the High Melton campus closure was announced with most services and delivery relocated to The Hub campus. DN Colleges Group On 1 November 2017, Doncaster College merged with Scunthorpe-based North Lindsey College, creating the DN Colleges Group. Staff and students The College employs around 760 staff and accommodates around 6,390 part and full-time students aged 16+. Academics In the latest Ofsted report, published in April 2016, the college was judged to be \\"Good\\" in all judgement aspects. Campus The main Doncaster College building, known as The Hub  The Hub  Situated in Doncaster's town centre, the ¬£65-million Waterfront campus opened in September 2006, giving students access to some of the best educational facilities in the country. The Hub offers a wide variety of both higher and further education courses at the campus. Principals Anne Tyrrell was appointed Interim Joint Chief Executive in 2017, overseeing the merger with Scunthorpe-based North Lindsey College to create the DN Colleges Group.

This includes the transferring of raw and refined petroleum between tanks and tankers; tankers and ships and other transactions. Custody transfer in fluid measurement is defined as a metering point (location) where the fluid is being measured for sale from one party to another. During custody transfer, accuracy is of great importance to both the company delivering the material and the eventual recipient, when transferring a material. The term \\"fiscal metering\\" is often interchanged with custody transfer, and refers to metering that is a point of a commercial transaction such as when a change in ownership takes place. Custody transfer takes place any time fluids are passed from the possession of one party to another. Custody transfer generally involves: * Industry standards; * National metrology standards; * Contractual agreements between custody transfer parties; and * Government regulation and taxation. Due to the high level of accuracy required during custody transfer applications, the flowmeters which are used to perform this are subject to approval by an organization such as the American Petroleum Institute (API). Custody transfer operations can occur at a number of points along the way; these may include operations, transactions or transferring of oil from an oil production platform to a ship, barge, railcar, truck and also to the final destination point, such as a refinery. Metering methods Custody transfer is one of the most important applications for flow measurement. Many flow measurement technologies are used for custody transfer applications; these include differential pressure (DP) flowmeters, turbine flowmeters, positive displacement flowmeters, Coriolis flowmeters and ultrasonic flowmeters. Differential pressure flowmeters Differential pressure (DP) flowmeters are used for the custody transfer of liquid and gas to measure the flow of liquid, gas, and steam. The DP flowmeter consist of a differential pressure transmitter and a primary element. The primary element places a constriction in a flow stream, while the DP transmitter measures the difference in pressure upstream and downstream of the constriction. In many cases, pressure transmitters and primary elements are bought by the end-users from different suppliers. However, several vendors have integrated the pressure transmitter with the primary element to form a complete flowmeter. The advantage of this is that they can be calibrated with the primary element and DP transmitter already in place. Standards and criteria for the use of DP flowmeters for custody transfer applications are specified by the American Gas Association (AGA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). An advantage of using a DP flowmeters is that they are the most studied and best understood type of flowmeter. A disadvantage of using a DP flowmeters is that they introduce a pressure drop into the flowmeter line. This is a necessary result of the constriction in the line that is required to make the DP flow measurement. One important development in the use of DP flowmeters for custody transfer applications has been the development of single and dual chamber orifice fittings. Turbine flowmeters The first turbine flowmeter was invented by Reinhard Woltman, a German engineer in 1790. Turbine flowmeters consist of a rotor with propeller-like blades that spins as water or some other fluid passes over it. The rotor spins in proportion to flow rate (see turbine meters) . There are many types of turbine meters, but many of those used for gas flow are called axial meters. The turbine flowmeter is most useful when measuring clean, steady, high-speed flow of low-viscosity fluids. In comparison to other flowmeters, the turbine flowmeter has a significant cost advantage over ultrasonic flowmeters, especially in the larger line sizes, and it also has a favourable price compared to the prices of DP flowmeters, especially in cases where one turbine meter can replace several DP meters. The disadvantage of turbine flowmeters is that they have moving parts that are subject to wear. To prevent wear and inaccuracy, durable materials are used, including ceramic ball bearings. Positive displacement flowmeters Positive displacement (PD) flowmeters are highly accurate meters that are widely used for custody transfer of commercial and industrial water, as well as for custody transfer of many other liquids. PD flowmeters have the advantage that they have been approved by a number of regulatory bodies for this purpose, and they have not yet been displaced by other applications. PD meters excel at measuring low flows, and also at measuring highly viscous flows, because PD meters captures the flow in a container of known volume. Speed of flow doesn‚Äôt matter when using a PD meter. Coriolis flowmeters Coriolis flowmeters have been around for more than 30 years and are preferred in process industries such as chemical and food and beverage. Coriolis technology offers accuracy and reliability in measuring material flow, and is often hailed as among the best flow measurement technologies due to direct mass flow, fluid density, temperature, and precise calculated volume flow rates. Coriolis meters do not have any moving parts and provide long term stability, repeatability, and reliability. Because they are direct mass flow measurement devices, Coriolis meters can handle the widest range of fluids from gases to heavy liquids and are not impacted by viscosity or density changes that often effect velocity based technologies (PD, Turbine, Ultrasonic). With the widest flow range capability of any flow technology, Coriolis can be sized for low pressure drop. This combined with the fact that they are not flow profile dependent helps eliminate the need for straight runs and flow conditioning which enables custody transfer systems to be designed with minimal pressure drop. It has to be mentioned that any measurement instrument that relies on one measurement principle only will show a higher measurement uncertainty under two-phase flow conditions. Conventional measurement principles, like positive displacement, turbine meters, orifice plates will seemingly continue to measure, but will not be able to inform the user about the occurrence of two-phase flow. Yet modern principles based on the Coriolis effect or ultrasonic flow measurement will inform the user by means of diagnostic functions. Flow is measured using Coriolis meters by analyzing the changes in the Coriolis force of a flowing substance. The force is generated in a mass moving within a rotating frame of reference. An angular, outward acceleration, which is factored with linear velocity is produced due to the rotation. With a fluid mass, the Coriolis force is proportional to the mass flow rate of that fluid. A Coriolis meter has two main components: an oscillating flow tube equipped with sensors and drivers, and an electronic transmitter that controls the oscillations, analyzes the results, and transmits the information. The Coriolis principle for flow measurement requires the oscillating section of a rotating pipe to be exploited. Oscillation produces the Coriolis force, which traditionally is sensed and analyzed to determine the rate of flow. Modern coriolis meters utilize the phase difference measured at each end of the oscillating pipe. Ultrasonic flowmeters Ultrasonic flowmeters were first introduced into industrial markets in 1963 by Tokyo Keiki (now Tokimec) in Japan. Custody transfer measurements have been around for a long time, and over the past ten years, Coriolis and ultrasonic meters have become the flowmeters of choice for custody transfer in the oil and gas industry. Ultrasonic meters provide volumetric flow rate. They typically use the transit-time method, where sounds waves transmitted in the direction of fluid flow travel faster than those travelling upstream. The transit time difference is proportional to fluid velocity. Ultrasonic flow meters have negligible pressure drop if recommended installation is followed, have high turndown capability, and can handle a wide range of applications. Crude oil production, transportation, and processing are typical applications for this technology. The use of ultrasonic flowmeters is continuing to grow for custody transfer. Unlike PD and turbine meters, ultrasonic flowmeters do not have moving parts. Pressure drop is much reduced with an ultrasonic meter when compared to PD, turbine, and DP meters. Installation of ultrasonic meters is relatively straightforward, and maintenance requirements are low. In June 1998, The American Gas Association published a standard called AGA-9. This standard lays out the criteria for the use of Ultrasonic flowmeters for Custody Transfer of Natural Gas. Components Custody transfer requires an entire metering system that is designed and engineered for the application, not just flowmeters. Components of a custody transfer system typically include: * Multiple meters/meter runs; * Flow computers; * Quality systems (gas chromatographs to measure energy content of natural gas and sampling systems for liquid); * Calibration using in-place or mobile provers for liquid, or master-meter for liquid or gas; and * Supporting automation. A typical liquid custody transfer skid includes multiple flowmeters and meter provers. Provers are used to calibrate meters in-situ and are performed frequently; typically before, during, and after a batch transfer for metering assurance. A good example of this is a Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) unit in a crude oil production facility. Accuracy In the ISO 5725-1 standard accuracy for measuring instruments is defined as ‚Äúthe closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference value‚Äù. This term ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù includes both the systematic error and the bias component. Each device has its manufacturer stated accuracy specification and its tested accuracy. Uncertainty takes all the metering system factors that impact measurement accuracy into account. The accuracy of flowmeters could be used in two different metering systems that ultimately have different calculated uncertainties due to other factors in the system that affect flow calculations. Uncertainty even includes such factors as the flow computer's A/D converter accuracy. The quest for accuracy in a custody transfer system requires meticulous attention to detail. Custody transfer requirements Custody transfer metering systems must meet requirements set by industry bodies such as AGA, API, or ISO, and national metrology standards such as OIML (International), NIST (U.S.), PTB (Germany), CMC (China), and GOST (Russia), among others. These requirements can be of two types: Legal and Contract. Legal The national Weights & Measures codes and regulations control the wholesale and retail trade requirements to facilitate fair trade. The regulations and accuracy requirements vary widely between countries and commodities, but they all have one common characteristic - ‚Äútraceability‚Äù. There is always a procedure that defines the validation process where the duty meter is compared to a standard that is traceable to the legal metrology agency of the respective region. Contract A contract is a written agreement between buyers and sellers that defines the measurement requirements. These are large-volume sales between operating companies where refined products and crude oils are transported by marine, pipeline or rail. Custody transfer measurement must be at the highest level of accuracy possible because a small error in measurement can amount to a large financial difference. Due to these critical natures of measurements, petroleum companies around the world have developed and adopted standards to meet the industry's needs. In Canada, for instance, all measurement of a custody transfer nature falls under the purview of Measurement Canada. In the USA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) controls the standards which must be met for interstate trade. Liquid custody transfer Custody transfer of liquid flow measurement follow guidelines set by the ISO. By industrial consensus, liquid flow measurement is defined as having an overall uncertainty of ¬±0.25% or better. The overall uncertainty is derived from an appropriate statistical combination of the component uncertainties in the measurement system. Mode of measurementVolume or mass measurement= Liquid flow measurements are usually in volumetric or mass unit. Volume is normally used for stand- alone field tanker loading operations, while mass is used for multi-field pipeline or offshore pipeline with an allocation requirement. Mass measurement and reporting are achieved by * Measurement of volume flow rate (for example, by turbine or ultrasonic meter) and fluid density * Direct mass measurement by Coriolis meter =Sampling system= An automatic flow-proportional sampling system is used in flow measurement to determine the average water content, average density and for analysis purposes. Sampling systems should be broadly in accordance with ISO 3171. The sampling system is a critical section during flow measurement. Any errors introduced through sampling error will generally have a direct, linear effect on the overall measurement. =Temperature and pressure measurement= Temperature and pressure measurement are important factors to consider when taking flow measurements of liquids. Temperature and pressure measurement points should be situated as close to the meter as possible, in reference to their conditions at the meter inlet. Temperature measurements that affect the accuracy of the metering system should have an overall loop accuracy of 0.5 ¬∞C or better, and the corresponding readout should have a resolution of 0.2 ¬∞C or better. Temperature checks are performed by certified thermometers with the aid of Thermowells Pressure measurements that affect the accuracy of the metering system should have an overall loop accuracy of 0.5 bar or better and the corresponding readout should have a resolution of 0.1 bar or better. Gaseous custody transfer Custody transfer of gaseous flow measurement follow guidelines set by the international bodies. By industrial consensus, gaseous flow measurement is defined as mass flow measurement with an overall uncertainty of ¬±1.0% or better. The overall uncertainty is derived from an appropriate statistical combination of the component uncertainties in the measurement system. Mode of measurementVolume or mass unit= All gaseous flow measurement must be made on single-phase gas streams, having measurements in either volumetric or mass units. =Sampling= Sampling is an important aspect, as they help to ascertain accuracy. Apt facilities should be provided for the purpose of obtaining representative samples. The type of instrumentation and the measuring system may influence this requirement. =Gas density= Gas density at the meter may be determined either by: * Continuous direct measurement, by on-line densitometer * Calculation, using a recognised equation of state together with measurements of the gas temperature, pressure and composition. Most industries prefer to use the continuous measurement of gas density. However, both methods may be used simultaneously, and the comparison of their respective results may provide additional confidence in the accuracy of each method. Best practices In any custody transfer application, a true random uncertainty has an equal chance of favouring either party, the net impact should be zero to both parties, and measurement accuracy and repeatability should not be valued. Measurement accuracy and repeatability are of high value to most seller because many users install check meters. The first step in designing any custody transfer system is to determine the mutual measurement performance expectations of the supplier and the user over the range of flow rates. This determination of mutual performance expectations should be made by individuals who have a clear understanding of all of the costs of measurement disputes caused by poor repeatability. The second step is to quantify the operating conditions which are not controllable. For a flow measurement, these can include: * Expected ambient temperature variation; * Maximum static line pressure; * Static line pressure and temperature variation; * Maximum allowable permanent pressure loss; * Flow turndown; and * Expected frequency of flow variation and/or pulsation. The third and final step is to select hardware, installation and maintenance procedures which will ensure that the measurement provides the required installed performance under the expected (uncontrollable) operating conditions. For example, the user can: * Select a static and/or differential pressure transmitter which has better or worse performance under the given real-world operating conditions. * Calibrate the transmitter(s) frequently or infrequently. * In the case of a DP flowmeter, size the primary element for a higher or lower differential pressure (higher DP's provide higher accuracy, at the expense of higher pressure loss). * Select a flowmeter and pressure transmitter with faster or slower response. * Use long or short interconnection (impulse) lines, or direct connect for fastest response. While the first and second steps involve gathering data, the third step may require calculations and/or testing. General formula for calculating energy transferred (LNG) The formula for calculating the LNG transferred depends on the contractual sales conditions. These can relate to three types of sale contract as defined by Incoterms 2000: an FOB sale, a CIF sale or a DES sale. In the case of an FOB (Free On Board) sale, the determination of the energy transferred and invoiced for will be made in the loading port. In the case of a CIF (Cost Insurance & Freight) or a DES (Delivered Ex Ship) sale, the energy transferred and invoiced for will be determined in the unloading port. In FOB contracts, the buyer is responsible to provide and maintain the custody transfer measurement systems on board the vessel for volume, temperature and pressure determination and the seller is responsible to provide and maintain the custody transfer measurement systems at the loading terminal such as the sampling and gas analysis. For CIF and DES contracts the responsibility is reversed. Both buyer and seller have the right to verify the accuracy of each system that is provided, maintained and operated by the other party. The determination of the transferred energy usually happens in the presence of one or more surveyors, the ship‚Äôs cargo officer and a representative of the LNG terminal operator. A representative of the buyer can also be present. In all cases, the transferred energy can be calculated with the following formula: E =(VLNG √ó DLNG √ó GVCLNG) - Egas displaced ¬± Egas to ER (if applicable) Where: E = the total net energy transferred from the loading facilities to the LNG carrier, or from the LNG carrier to the unloading facilities. VLNG= the volume of LNG loaded or unloaded in m3. DLNG = the density of LNG loaded or unloaded in kg/m3. GCVLNG = the gross calorific value of the LNG loaded or unloaded in million BTU/kg E gas displaced = The net energy of the displaced gas, also in million BTU, which is either: sent back onshore by the LNG carrier when loading (volume of gas in cargo tanks displaced by same volume of loaded LNG), Or, gas received by the LNG carrier in its cargo tanks when unloading in replacement of the volume of discharged LNG. E(gas to ER) = If applicable, the energy of the gas consumed in the LNG carrier‚Äôs engine room during the time between opening and closing custody transfer surveys, i.e. used by the vessel at the port, which is: \\\\+ For an LNG loading transfer or \\\\- For an LNG unloading transfer ReferencesExternal links * Measurement Canada. * CMC * Tokyo KEIKI * API * Flow Research * GUIDANCE NOTES FOR PETROLEUM MEASUREMENT (Highly recommended) * ISO Category:Fluid mechanics ","title":"Custody transfer"},{"id":"12703263","text":"Lestinogomphus angustus (spined fairytail or common fairytail) is a species of dragonfly in the family Gomphidae.

The hospital was organized in 1946 as a memorial to local soldiers who died in World War II, and the present Court Drive facility opened in 1973. In 2013, the name was changed to CaroMont Regional Medical Center. History Gaston Memorial Hospital was established in 1945 on North Highland Street, Gastonia. In the late 1960s, the hospital acquired 74 acres located between Cox Road and New Hope Road, which was adjacent to 112 acres owned by Gaston County. The hospital sold this land to Gaston County for $1, and the County built a new hospital facility. In 1970 Gaston Memorial Hospital also sold the county the original land and buildings located on North Highland, valued at $3 million, again for $1. The BirthPlace In 1973 Gaston Memorial Hospital began operating the hospital facility on Court Drive. Later that decade the hospital secured the funds for and built the Gaston Lincoln Mental Health Center, located adjacent to the Hospital, and transferred the building to Gaston County. In 1984 Gaston Health Care and Gaston County entered into the current lease arrangement; Gaston Health Care paid off the remaining 11 years of outstanding bonds which had been incurred to construct the facility. The next year the county conveyed all equipment, machinery and instruments owned by the County and located at the Hospital to Gaston Health Care. In 1993 92.62 acres of property then being leased by the Hospital were released from the lease and returned to the County for no consideration. In 1997 Gaston Memorial Hospital completed construction on the Gaston Professional Center and Gaston Ambulatory Surgery at a cost of $20 million. The next year CaroMont Heart Center was formed to deliver Heart By- Pass Surgery in Gaston County. The New Birth Place opened in October 2004.

He left home at an early age and went to Chile where he graduated from secondary school, and later attended the Universidad de Santiago de Chile. He traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to further his education. His art studies began while in Santiago. Eventually he traveled to Brazil where he studied art at the Escola de Belas Artes, in Rio de Janeiro. Restrepo-Pel√°ez accepted an offer to represent his country as Vice-Consul in Paris, France. After three years, he traveled to Florence, Italy to become a pupil of Giovanni Colacicchi at the Accademia di Belle Arti during an extended period. After a decade of travel throughout Europe he went to live in Mexico City and Los Angeles, California. He studied restoration and conservation at Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, in Madrid, Spain, interning later at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. He has written extensively on art as well as on political and historical subjects. His column appeared regularly in El Tiempo, Colombia's principal news publication.

It is under threat by rapid loss of the ponds and other small water bodies it uses as habitat, and is currently classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. Description The bekko tombo is a golden to rusty-brown dragonfly, with a dark stripe down the centre of the abdomen and a distinctive pattern of dark markings on its wings. Like other members of the family Libellulidae, this dragonfly has a relatively short, broad abdomen, and its body is distinctly shorter than its wingspan. Distribution and habitat The bekko tombo occurs in central and northern China, Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and offshore islands) and Korea. It inhabits old and stable ponds with moderate plant growth in lowland hill areas. It requires clear, open water in which the nymphs crawl around in the bottom sediments. Ecology The bekko tombo is univoltine. It has a larval period of one year. Eggs hatch from May to June, and adults emerge the following spring. There is often fierce competition between males for access to reproductive females. Females typically begin to lay eggs in water immediately after copulation, often guarded by their mate. However, females of some species can store live sperm in their body for a number of days. Threats and Conservation The bekko tombo has experienced drastic declines in recent decades, mostly driven by the continuing disappearance of its required breeding habitats, old and stable ponds with vegetated borders. Introduced predators such as the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) have also had an impact. The species has been protected in Japan since 1993, and efforts by various NGOs are ongoing to preserve and reconstitute suitable breeding habitats. Current population is estimated at less than 5,000 individuals, and the species has been classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.

For example, a device with a maximum output of 10 units and a minimum output of 2 units has a turndown ratio of 5. The term is commonly used with measurement devices and combustion plant like boilers and gasifiers. Flow meters In flow measurement, the turndown ratio indicates the range of flow that a flow meter is able to measure with acceptable accuracy. It is also known as rangeability. It is important when choosing a flow meter technology for a specific application. If a gas flow to be measured is expected to vary between 100,000 m¬≥ per day and 1,000,000 m¬≥ per day, the specific application has a turndown ratio of at least 10:1. Therefore the meter requires a turndown ratio of at least 10:1. For example: if the meter had an advertised maximum flow of 2,000,000 m¬≥ per day then the required turndown ratio would be 20:1. The turndown ratio of each type of meter is limited by theoretical considerations and by practical considerations. For example, orifice meters create a pressure drop in the measured fluid proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore the range of differential pressure can become too large and compromise accuracy. It can also create process problems such as hydrate formation, and in the case of measuring the discharge of a compressor, there is a limit to how much pressure loss is acceptable.  Typical turndown ratio of various meter types  The examples are here for gas flow, but the same meter types can be used on liquids as well, with similar turndown ratios. Note that meter manufacturers state their products' turndown ratios‚Äîa specific product may have a turndown ratio that varies from the list below. A Thermal Mass Flow Meter has a turndown ratio of 1000:1. An orifice plate meter has a practical turndown ratio of 3:1. A Turbine Meter has a turndown ratio of 10:1. Rotary positive displacement meters have a turndown ratio of between 10:1 and 80:1, depending on the manufacturer and the application. Diaphragm meters are considered to have a turndown ratio of 80:1. Multipath ultrasonic meters often have a stated turndown ratio of 50:1. Boilers Boiler turndown ratio is the ratio of maximum heat output to the minimum level of heat output at which the boiler will operate efficiently or controllably. Many boilers are designed to operate at a variety of output levels. As the desired temperature/pressure point is approached, the heat source is progressively turned down. If pressure/temperature falls, the heat source is progressively turned up. If a boiler application requires it to operate at a low proportion of its maximum output, a high turndown ratio is required. Conversely, in applications where the operational conditions are not expected to vary significantly (for example, a large power plant), a low turndown ratio will be sufficient. If the heating plant is only working at a small fraction of its maximum and the turndown ratio is too low, at some point the burner will still need to be shut off when the desired pressure/temperature is achieved. This in turn leads to a rapid reduction in temperature/pressure, requiring the boiler to restart. Cycling frequency can be as high as 12 times per hour. This is undesirable, as flue gases are purged during both the shut-down and start-up phases, leading to energy losses and therefore inefficiency. Additionally, typical startup times for boilers are in the order of one to two minutes, leading to an inability to respond to sudden load demands.  Typical turndown ratios for various boiler types  Electricity As there are no combustion losses associated with electricity, nor delays in system startup, is it unusual to have any means of modulating down the energy supply (i.e., turndown ratio is 1). Gas Gas boilers can be designed for turndown ratios of 10-12 with little to no loss in combustion efficiency, while some gas burners may achieve a ratio of 35. However, typical turndown ratio is 5. In the search for increased efficiency, even very small gas boilers have modulating burners these days. In practice only boilers with fan assisted fuel/air circulation will have the modulating feature. The fan also mixes gas and air more thoroughly, so achieving more efficient combustion. If the boiler is of the high efficiency condensing type, high turndown ratios are feasible and the higher the turndown ratio, the more efficient it will be. Every time a gas/oil boiler stops, it has to be \\"purged\\" with cold air to remove any combustible gases that may have accumulated in the boiler before restarting. (This to prevent possible explosion.) This cold air takes heat from the boiler every time this happens. Higher turndown ratios mean fewer stops and starts and hence fewer losses. Oil Oil burning boilers can achieve turndown ratios as high as 20, but typically only 2 to 4 with conventional burner designs. Small domestic \\"vaporising\\" (i.e. burning kerosene or 28 second oil) burners do not modulate at all and are relatively inefficient. Boilers using the pressure jet type of burner, i.e. with a fan, (usually with 35 second oil) can achieve a turndown ratio of 2, while the rotary cup type burner can achieve 4. Condensing oil boilers are fairly unusual; the condensate from the combustion of oil is far more aggressive than gas, mainly due to sulphur content. These days oil companies are reducing sulphur content of oil on environmental grounds, so this may change. However due to problem of mixing the oil and air, turndown ratios of greater than four are uncommon. Coal These days mechanised coal boilers only occur in large industrial plant due to the convenience and easy availability of gas. Theoretically coal burning plant can have quite a high turndown ratio, and in the days of hand firing coal boilers this was common. On systems where coal is burned on a grate, turndown ratio must be greater than 1 due to the fact that a sudden reduction/cessation of the load can leave many tons of burning fuel on the grate.

It was bound for Tahiti's Fa'a'ƒÅ International Airport on a regular 7-minute service, one of the shortest on earth, scheduled a day. The crash resulted from loss of control due to failure of the airplane's elevator cable. Frequent takeoff and landing are believed to have been a major factor in the crash, because of wear and tear on the elevator cables, inspected only at fixed time intervals, regardless of usage. Another factor may have been jet-blast from large planes pushing back from the ramp at Fa'a'ƒÅ International. Flight and crash The aircraft, reg. F-OIQI was a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter built-in 1979. The airframe had been flying in more than 55,000 cycles in 30,800 hours before the crash. It was 28 years old at the time of the accident. The pilot was 53-year-old French Polynesian Michel Santeurenne. Air Moorea flights generally required only a single pilot, and on 9 August Santeurenne was flying the short hop without any other crewmembers. He had completed over 3,500 hours of flight time, including 110 hours for Air Moorea since 14 May 2007. He had worked for Air Moorea for three months at the time of the accident. The oft-traveled Moorea to Tahiti route is one of the shortest in the world ‚Äì only a 7-minute flight on average ‚Äì and is flown 40 to 50 times a day. On 9 August 2007, F-OIQI was the aircraft operating the short route. The aircraft took off without incident just past noon, and was climbing through 400 feet when, according to eyewitnesses, it suddenly nosed down without warning and dove into the ocean, killing all 20 onboard ‚Äì 19 passengers and the pilot, Santeurenne. Investigation As the islands are French territory, the accident was investigated by the Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA). Following analysis of the recovered CVR and parts of airplane wreckage from a depth of , as well as metallurgical testing of the cable, the BEA concluded: \\"The accident was caused by the loss of airplane pitch control following the failure, at a low height, of the elevator pitch-up control cable at the time the flaps were retracted. Factors contributing to the cable's failure were wear and tear due to frequent takeoff and landing cycles, and inspection of the cables only at fixed time intervals regardless of usage. Other factors may have been jet- blast from large planes pushing back from the ramp at Fa'a'ƒÅ International and the salt air environment.

For most of its history, the Signal's editorial stance was one of vigorous anti-Mormonism and the advancement of the policies of the Whig Party. Names and incarnations The newspaper was founded as the Western World, with its first edition published on May 13, 1840. In its May 12, 1841 edition, noting that Western World was a title that was \\"too extensive in its signification\\", the paper, which had been purchased by Thomas C. Sharp, changed its name to Warsaw Signal. On January 7, 1843, the name was changed to Warsaw Message after Sharp sold the newspaper, but on February 14, 1844 the name reverted to Warsaw Signal when it was repurchased by Sharp. In 1850, it was purchased by James McKee who renamed it Warsaw Commercial Journal. In 1855, McKee merged the Commercial Journal with the Journal of the People to create the Warsaw Express and Journal, which published until the late 1850s. In 1975, a new paper began publishing under the name Warsaw Signal, but its existence was short-lived. Anti-Mormonism The Signal was vigorously anti-Mormon in its editorial stance. During the two separate periods of time when it bore the name Warsaw Signal, the owner and editor of the newspaper was Thomas C. Sharp, a leader in opposing Joseph Smith and the Latter Day Saint presence in Illinois. Upon hearing news of the city- ordered destruction of neighboring, Mormon-critical press Nauvoo Expositor with assistance from an armed pro-Mormon mob, Sharp editorialized: > War and extermination is inevitable! Citizens ARISE, ONE and ALL!!!‚ÄîCan you > stand by, and suffer such INFERNAL DEVILS! To ROB men of their property and > RIGHTS, without avenging them. We have no time for comment, every man will > make his own. LET IT BE MADE WITH POWDER AND BALL!!!Warsaw Signal, June 11, > 1844. In a June 14, 1844 extra edition, the Signal published the minutes of a meeting of Warsaw residents organized by Sharp whereby those in attendance condemned Smith's destruction of the printing press of the Nauvoo Expositor and resolved that \\"the Prophet [Smith] and his miscreant adherents, should ... be demanded at their [the Latter Day Saints'] hands, and if not surrendered, a war of extermination should be waged to the entire destruction, if necessary for our protection, of his adherents.\\"Warsaw Signal, June 14, 1844. After Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob on June 27, Sharp editorialized in the July 10 edition: > Joe and Hiram [sic] Smith, at the time their lives were taken, were in the > custody of the officers of the law; and it is asked by those who condemn the > act, why the law was not first allowed to take its course before violence > was resorted to? We answer that the course of law in the case of these > wretches would have been a mere mockery; and such was the conviction of > every sensible man.Warsaw Signal, July 10, 1844. After the majority of the Latter Day Saints left Illinois under the leadership of Brigham Young, the Signal continued to report on the Mormons and their progression west and remained editorially opposed to the presence of Latter Day Saints in Illinois and surrounding states, particularly those who chose to follow James Strang. Mark Twain connection Some literary historians have suggested that Mark Twain, then known by his birth name Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was a type-setter and contributor to the Warsaw Signal for a few weeks in late 1855 or early 1856. In a January 1856 edition of the newspaper, an article attributed to \\"Thomas Jefferson Sole\\" entitled \\"Learning Grammar\\" appeared on the fourth page of the publication. Historians have noted that the article resembles much of Twain's later writings and that Twain would later use the pseudonyms \\"Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass\\" and \\"Soleather\\" before settling on \\"Mark Twain\\".

Sharp Thomas Coke Sharp (September 25, 1818 ‚Äì April 9, 1894) was a prominent opponent of Joseph Smith and the Latter Day Saints in Illinois in the 1840s. Sharp promoted his anti-Mormon views largely through the Warsaw Signal newspaper, of which he was the owner, editor, and publisher. Sharp was one of five defendants tried and acquitted of the murders of Smith and his brother Hyrum. Early life Sharp was born in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey, the son of prominent Methodist preacher Solomon Sharp.Staff. Biographical review of Hancock County, Illinois, p. 109. Hobart Publishing Co., 1907. Accessed February 28, 2011. He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and was admitted to the legal bar of Cumberland County, Illinois, in April 1840. However, Sharp was partially deaf, which made it difficult for him to function in courtrooms. He gave up his Illinois legal practice after a few months. Warsaw Signal and anti-Mormonism thumb Sharp moved to Warsaw, Illinois, in September 1840. Approximately 18 months earlier, Latter Day Saints had begun to arrive in the same county and settle in the town of Commerce, which by 1840 had been renamed Nauvoo. In November, Sharp and a business partner purchased a Warsaw newspaper entitled Western World, which they renamed Warsaw Signal in 1841. Sharp used the paper to promote his opposition to the Mormon presence in Hancock County. Within a few months, \\"Old Tom Sharp,\\" as he was called, had become a strong opponent of the Latter Day Saints. Sharp and some associates formed the Anti-Mormon Party to oppose Mormon influences in Hancock County. In 1841, Joseph Smith noted in his journal that Sharp \\"devoted his entire time to slandering, to lying against and misrepresenting the Latter-day Saints.\\"Joseph Smith, B.H. Roberts (ed.). History of the Church. 4:489. Sharp also opposed non-Mormons who assisted or were sympathetic to the Latter Day Saints, dubbing them \\"Jack Mormons\\".Illinois State Register, 1844-11-01; also reproduced in Nauvoo Neighbor, 1844-11-13. Due to financial losses, Sharp was forced to sell the Signal to its original owner in 1842. In 1842, Sharp ran as a candidate for the Hancock County seat in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative of the Whig Party. His principal opponent was William Smith, a Mormon apostle who ran for the Democratic Party. Smith won the election easily as a result of overwhelming support from Mormon voters in Nauvoo.James B. Allen and Glen E. Leonard (1976). The Story of the Latter-day Saints. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book ) p. 177. In February 1844, Sharp resumed ownership of the Warsaw Signal. The Signal was vigorously anti-Mormon in its editorial stance. In a June 11, 1844 editorial, Sharp wrote: > War and extermination is inevitable! Citizens ARISE, ONE and ALL!!!‚ÄîCan you > stand by, and suffer such INFERNAL DEVILS! to ROB men of their property and > RIGHTS, without avenging them.

Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were arrested and jailed on charges of destruction of the presses of the Nauvoo Expositor. They were killed at the jail by a mob on June 27, 1844. Sharp editorialized in the July 10 edition: > Joe and Hiram [sic] Smith, at the time their lives were taken, were in the > custody of the officers of the law; and it is asked by those who condemn the > act, why the law was not first allowed to take its course before violence > was resorted to?

Arrest and trial On September 25, 1844, a deputy sheriff attempted to arrest Sharp as a suspect in the murders of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Sharp refused to go with the sheriff, arguing that his fellow citizens of Warsaw would not want him to surrender. Two days later, Illinois governor Thomas Ford issued a proclamation offering a reward of two hundred dollars for the arrest of Sharp. Soon afterward, Sharp crossed the Mississippi River and went into hiding in Alexandria, Missouri. By October 1, Sharp agreed to surrender on condition that he would be tried at Quincy, Illinois as opposed to Nauvoo, and that the governor would instruct the courts to release Sharp on bail pending his trial. The next day, Sharp was indicted for the murders and released on $2000 bail. At trial, Sharp and four other accused personsMark Aldrich, Jacob C. Davis, William N. Grover and Levi Williams. were acquitted by a jury of the murders of the Smiths. Later life Sharp gave up ownership and editorship of the Warsaw Signal in 1846. He was an elected delegate to the Illinois state constitutional convention in 1847 and was elected to three successive terms as the mayor of Warsaw beginning in 1853. He ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for an Illinois seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1856. In 1865, Sharp was elected as a judge in Hancock County. Later, he served as a school principal and eventually returned to the newspaper publishing business with ownership of the Carthage Gazette. He died in Carthage, Illinois, at the age of 75.

It was established in 1713 by Palatine German refugees from the Rhineland-Palatinate who were transported from England in 1710 and settled on the site of the present city of Newburgh. The cemetery is within a section of the city known as the Glebe, a 500-acre (2 km¬≤) grant made by Queen Anne to provide for a schoolmaster and clergyman for these German families. A church built by the Palatines was located on the western edge of the site, on what is now Liberty Street. As the Old Town Cemetery and Palatine Church Site, it was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is also a contributing element in the larger Montgomery-Grand-Liberty Streets Historic District. See also: There are an estimated 1,700 burials in the cemetery, although there may at one time have been 2,500. Thirteen hundred headstones survive today; the earliest date of death still legible is 1759. Among the noteworthy persons are congressmen Jonathan Fisk and Thomas McKissock. Robinson Mausoleum The mausoleum of ship Capt. Henry Robinson, his wife Ann Buchan Robinson, and their two daughters, Sarah Robinson and Mary Robinson Benkard is architecturally distinctive. It was built in 1853, possibly by Alexander Jackson Davis, whose most notable work in Newburgh, the Dutch Reformed Church, stands a few blocks away. It is believed to be the only Egyptian Revival tomb to feature both a mastaba and a pyramid. It was overgrown and fell into disrepair until a 1999 restoration. An interesting memorial marker here is the one for Archibald Wiseman and two of his young children by his wife, Susan Clyde, located at gravesite 1-140. Somewhat of a mystery is the inscription on the marker that reports that he died at sea on May 9, 1853. His widow Susan remarried in 1860 to a James McCord, a leather tanner and apparently unrelated to the McCord family of brush manufacturers in Newburgh, and she and McCord are last recorded in the 1880 Census at the home of her son, David Clyde Wiseman (who suffered from 'consumption') and his daughter Mary, who married in about 1869. Mary was the only daughter of James McCord by an earlier marriage. Susan and James' later fate after 1880 is unknown as of June 2011. In 1803 New York amended the law governing the Glebe, and later an Old Town Cemetery Commission was created by the city. It consists of five members, three of them serving ex officio: the city's mayor, the local superintendent of schools and the pastor of Calvary Presbyterian Church. The other two members are appointed by the city council. Currently those are John McCormick and Gerardo Sanchez, whose company restored the Robinson Mausoleum..

Sarnoff (April 5, 1917 - May 23, 1990) was an American doctor who produced over 200 papers and 60 patents during his long career. His work included the development of such widely used devices as the \\"auto-injector,\\" which included the AtroPen, which was filled with Atropine Hydrochloride as an anti-nerve-gas antidote for military use; the LidoPen, which was filled with Lidocaine hydrochloride, for cardiac patients, the EpiPen, containing Epinephrine, for people whose allergies cause anaphylaxis, and the 24-hour cardiac monitor. In addition to his own work, he was devoted to philanthropy and, though the creation of The Stanley J Sarnoff Endowment for Cardiovascular Science, he has helped to inspire medical students and cardiology fellows from around the country to pursue cardiovascular research. Early life A graduate of the Peddie School, Sarnoff received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University (1938) and his medical degree form Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (1942). Although he was interested in research as a medical student, Sarnoff was strongly encouraged to become a cardiac surgeon by his father, Jacob Sarnoff, who was a prominent surgeon of the time. While Sarnoff was assisting his father in the operating room, he made observations which challenged conventional thoughts on cardiac physiology. The observations he made on that day became the foundation of his bench research and changed the way cardiology was practiced. After his residency, Sarnoff completed post graduate training at Bellevue Hospital (New York), Beth Israel Hospital (Boston), Mount Sinai Hospital (New York), and Harvard Medical School. Early career After his training, Sarnoff spent a dozen years at the Harvard School of Public Health (1948‚Äì1960) as an assistant professor of physiology and he became chief of the cardiovascular physiology laboratory at the National Heart Institute (1954). At the NIH, Sarnoff published some of his most renowned papers in cardiac physiology. Sarnoff's first paper on ventricular function, published with Erik Berglund, was \\"Starling's Law of the Heart.\\" After becoming chief of the cardiovascular physiology lab at NIH, he initiated a number of studies on valvular heart disease. A succession of prominent cardiac investigators work in Sarnoff's lab, including Eugene Braunwald, Joseph Gilmore, Jere Mitchell, William John Powell Jr, Edmund Sonnenblick, Andrew Wallace and Myron Weisfeldt. Sarnoff's experience mentoring Myron Weisfeldt, who was then a young medical student from Johns Hopkins, spurred him to begin his philanthropic efforts toward medical students. After suffering a serious heart attack himself, Sarnoff left the NIH. He and his wife LoLo began Rodana Research Corporation followed by Survival Technology Inc (STI), a publicly traded company registered with NASDAQ. Survival Technology manufactured his auto-injectors. Although the auto-injectors were first developed for military use to administer a nerve gas antidote, Sarnoff used them to immediately treat heart attacks so that the patient could survive until a medical team could arrive. Founding the Sarnoff Fellowship Program As STI prospered financially, Sarnoff was inspired to encourage young medical students to pursue cardiovascular research. He believed that a medical student could conduct his own research, defend his findings and participate in the work of the lab as a full-time scientist thereby allowing the student to yield great benefit from the lab environment. After discussions with Ellis Rolett, the chair of cardiology at Dartmouth, in 1979 Sarnoff agreed to meet four young medical students. He was so impressed by their enthusiasm that within one month Sarnoff writes a $10,000 check to Dartmouth to fund the first fellow. It was a revolutionary action. At that time, there were no other well known fellowships for medical students. In fact, the Sarnoff fellowship would form the basis for programs such as the AHA Student Research Scholarship program and the Howard Hughes NIH Research Scholars program, or cloisters program, which would not begin until 1984. For Sarnoff, what began with a single medical student fellow in 1979 spread to hundreds more. Based on his experience with Weisfeldt, Sarnoff established a set of simple rules for the fellowship: the medical student would leave school for one year, work in the laboratory of a prominent cardiovascular scientist conducting his own research and participate as if he were an independent researcher. At the conclusion of his year, the student would report his findings to his mentors. As the fellowship grew, students would attend a yearly meeting and present their findings to their peers and to the Sarnoff Cardiovascular research community of mentors, advisors and past fellows. A major emphasis of these meetings was on Dr Sarnoff's question, \\"Did you have fun?\\" Sarnoff wanted the fellows to be caught up in the joys of scientific research and discovery. The year was intended to expose students to the rewards of scientific research but it was more than that; it was a way to encourage the students to examine other ways of thinking, other career paths. No project was a failure if the experiment failed because failure opened the way to other findings. If the student learned something about himself and his choices than he had succeeded. Alan Kono, the first Sarnoff Fellow, began a year study with Weisfeldt, who was one of Sarnoff's first students, at Johns Hopkins thus bringing the fellowship full circle. Growth of the Fellowship Program As the fellowship grew, scientists with whom Stanley had collaborated suggested promising candidates and they were selected as Fellows. Early meetings were small gatherings at his home and at nearby hotels. The weekends were filled with students' presentations but also were informal gatherings and finished up with an afternoon of tennis at Stanley's home. The program was formalized in 1981 with the formation of The Stanley J. Sarnoff Endowment for Cardiovascular Science, Inc., a public charity. Many of the sponsors of the early Fellows were invited to serve on the Endowment's Board of Directors. Over the next 10 years, endowment developed the existing research guidelines and practices. Through the remaining years of his life, Sarnoff and sponsors from a handful of medical schools reviewed and selected fellowship recipients. The endowment established a scientific board consisting of sponsors (researchers who submit students for the fellowship), preceptors (researchers who accept students into their lab), current and former students, and supporters of the Endowments mission from the academic community. Its primary charge is to select Fellows and to oversee the Fellow's year in the lab. A scholarship program was established to fund the post-doctoral research careers of MD cardiovascular scientists. Over 300 fellows and 30 scholars have completed the program, many of whom choose to pursue academic research or to pursue their research within industry or business. Many who practice medicine, point to their days as a Sarnoff Fellow as their most rewarding years in training and the alumni organization exists \\"with sincere thanks to Stanley Sarnoff for his unconditional gift.\\" Final years Sarnoff died in 1990, awaiting a heart transplant. He was survived by his wife LoLo. At the last Annual Meeting during his lifetime, which was a few weeks prior to his death, many of the Fellows and their mentors gathered by the telephone to speak a few words to him and to thank him for the influence he had on their lives. His will named The Sarnoff Foundation the principal beneficiary of his Estate, valued shortly after his death at nearly $30 million. The endowment continues to this day. Each year hundreds of people attend the Sarnoff Annual Meeting where a new set of young cardiovascular researchers is presented.

Never published in its historical period, the play existed only in a manuscript, which is now MS. V.a.128 in the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. A play titled The Fairy Knight was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 11 June 1624. In his records, Herbert attributed the play to John Ford and Thomas Dekker. Scholars and critics have widely rejected any application of this assignment of authorship to the extant text; in the words of Gerald Eades Bentley, \\"nothing in the manuscript sounds like Ford or Dekker....\\"Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 224. Many doubt that the play licensed by Herbert in 1624 is the same as the manuscript play; the critical literature often describes the Ford/Dekker Fairy Knight as a lost work. Fredson Bowers advanced a hypothesis that Thomas Randolph wrote the existing Fairy Knight.Fredson Bowers, \\"Ben Jonson, Thomas Randolph, and The Drinking Academy.\\" Notes and Queries Vol. 173 (1937), pp. 166-8. Bowers developed his hypothesis in his modern edition of the play, published in 1942;Fredson Thayer Bowers, ed., \\"The fary knight; or, Oberon the Second,\\" a manuscript play attributed to Thomas Randolph, Chapel Hill, NC, University of North Carolina Press, 1942. (Bowers employed the archaic spelling of \\"fary\\" for \\"fairy.\\") he argued that Randolph wrote the play for a performance at Westminster School around 1623 or 1624. Other commentators, however, have generally been unconvinced by Bowers' assignment of the play to Randolph. Some have seen signs of the influence of James Shirley in the play, noting resemblances to Shirley's The Traitor (1631) and The Young Admiral (1633), and have concluded that The Fairy Knight must post-date those plays. Since the MS. includes a 1658 epitaph (on the \\"virtuous lady Frances Monson\\"), critics tend to place the authorship of the play sometime between the mid-1630s and 1658Logan and Smith, p. 223. -- generally too late for Randolph, who died in 1635. Critics have also noted borrowings from Jonson's The Alchemist in The Fairy Knight. The play draws upon the fairy lore of the folktales and legends of the British Isles, and so can be classed with similar works like Drayton's Nymphidia. In the play, Loswello is the name of the fairy knight, while a silly politician called Politico is the pretender king of the fairies.

There is a thick black oblique stripe on the posterior half of mesepimeron and postero-lateral suture. Wings are transparent, tinted with amber-yellow at base. Abdomen is blood-red, marked with black. Segment 1 is narrowly bordered with ochreous yellow. Segments 2 and 3 are ochreous laterally. All segments have very narrow black borders. Segments 3 to 9 has a narrow mid-dorsal black stripe, faded in adults. Segment 10 is entirely black. Anal appendages are dark reddish-brown. Female is similar to the male; but its thorax is coppery-brown and segments 3 to 8 with mid-dorsal carina rather broadly black. File:Lyriothemis tricolor 2 by Manoj P.jpgMale; dorsal view File:Lyriothemis tricolor by Manoj P.jpgMale; side view File:Lyriothemis tricolor Ris, 1919.jpgFemale Habitat water collected in tree holes. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. Unlike other dragonflies and damselflies this species breeds in water collected inside the tree holes of evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Physicochemical parameters of water collected from the tree holes show that the water is generally acidic with high levels of total dissolved solids, phosphates, sulphates and nitrates. The pH varied from extremely acidic to (pH 3.56) to near neutral (pH 6.48). A diverse community of invertebrates and vertebrates coexist with L. tricolor larvae. It is not known how the different taxa interact in the community. However, the presence of predatory larvae of L. tricolor may significantly influence the community structure of tree holes.

In Eastern and Western Europe the art of puppetry is alive and well-respected and often nationally funded as it is part of national identity, similar to opera and ballet with which puppetry has crossed-over many times. As essentially a form of sculpture, puppet design has not suffered the fate of many nearly extinct crafts, however there are fewer puppet designers than puppeteers, especially as many puppets are mass-produced and sold in stores. However, there are a few modern day workshops who solely specialise in puppet design, for instance in London, Puppets Magic Studio operates a workshop dedicated to producing hand made puppets. In the United States, puppetry is primarily perceived as children's entertainment, though a few puppet designers have made the art form accessible to adult audiences. Popular American puppet designers include Bill Baird, Jim Henson, and Julie Taymor. Stan Winston of Stan Winston Studios considers many of his character creations to be puppets and for motion pictures his operating crews join the Screen Actors Guild because they are essentially performing directly through an inanimate, if sometimes robotic object. As they are operated directly by people and not pre-programmed, Stan Winston creations can be considered puppets rather than robots.

He served as a politician on the municipal and provincial levels of government in Alberta. He served on the city council of Wetaskiwin in various posts between 1906 and 1929. He also served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1914 to 1921 and again from 1930 to 1935 as a member of the Liberal Party in both government and opposition. Early life Hugh John Montgomery was born in Bedeque, Prince Edward Island on July 31, 1878. He grew up on the island and attended Charlottetown Business College He moved west in 1898 after graduating and settled in Wetaskiwin when it was still in the Northwest Territories. Montgomery became a merchandiser and owned part of a large grain and livestock ranch. He became involved in municipal politics soon after settling in the community. Political career=Municipal Montgomery served as an Alderman in Wetaskiwin from 1906 to 1909. He ran successfully for mayor of the city in 1910. In 1922 he was elected Chief Magistrate of the city and held that position until 1929. Provincial Montgomery first ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in a by-election on November 17, 1914 in the electoral district of Wetaskiwin. The by-election was called after the death of incumbent Charles Olin. Montgomery was elected by a wide margin over Conservative candidate Finlay Watson, who thus lost his deposit. In the 1917 general election he was re-elected in a landslide over Conservative candidate R.M. Angus. In the 1921 general election he was defeated by Evert Sparks of the United Farmers of Alberta. Montgomery and Sparks faced each other again in the 1926 general election, Sparks beat Montgomery by less than two hundred votes on the second vote count. The Conservative candidate's second-choice ballots were distributed after being dropped out in the first round, and most of them went to the UFA candidate, instead of to Montgomery.A Report on Alberta Elections, 1905-1982 Montgomery ran against Sparks for the third time in the 1930 general election and defeated him in a closely contested two-way, thus returning to office nine years after his defeat. Montgomery was defeated again in the 1935 general election, this time by John Wingblade of the Social Credit League. He finished a distant second in the field of five candidates. Montgomery attempted another comeback as an independent in the 1944 general election. He was once again defeated by Wingblade, finishing a very distant third place in the field of four candidates.

It is endemic to North America. It has a 17-year lifecycle but is otherwise indistinguishable from the 13-year periodical cicada Magicicada tredecassini. The two species are usually discussed together as \\"cassini periodical cicadas\\" or \\"cassini-type periodical cicadas.\\" Unlike other periodical cicadas, cassini-type males may synchronize their courting behavior so that tens of thousands of males sing and fly in unison. The specific name cassinii was in honour of John Cassin, an American ornithologist. Description The adult M. cassinii is very similar in appearance to other periodical cicadas. It is between long, measured from the front of the head to the tip of the wings folded over the abdomen. The head is black, the eyes are large and red, the pronotum is black apart from a narrow orange band at the edge of the sternites, and the abdomen is black. The legs are orange and the wings are translucent, with orange veins and dusky markings near the tips. Distribution and habitat Magicicada cassinii is endemic to North America, its range extending across the northern belt of the United States and the southern part of Canada. Life cycle These cicadas are true bugs and after having emerged from underground, the adults feed on sap sucked from trees and shrubs. Males amass in great numbers and sing in unison to attract females. The call lasts for two to four seconds and is a series of ticks followed by a drawn-out buzz which rises and falls in pitch. At the end of a chorus, males move to a new perch before starting the song again. After mating, the females insert their ovipositors into shoots and lay their eggs. These hatch about two months later and the first instar nymphs drop to the ground where they move underground and suck xylem sap from small rootlets. This sap is very low in nutritive value and the nymphs grow very slowly. They will moult five times, moving on to larger roots deep in the soil as they grow over a period of seventeen years. Finally, they all tunnel up through the soil and emerge into the open air, before climbing up the vegetation and shedding their skins for a final time to become adults. Although each population has a seventeen-year life cycle and emerges in synchrony, past environmental events have occasionally disrupted this pattern and there are several different broods in existence in various parts of the insect's range which emerge in different calendar years. In fact, their life cycle can range from thirteen to twenty- one years. The different broods have been numbered, and the next emergence of Brood X is due to occur in Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia in May and June 2021. Many broods have a sub-brood that emerge a few years before the regular brood. The Brood XIII sub-brood in the Chicago area emerged 4 years early in 2020.

The female cuts a slit in a twig in which to insert her eggs and this often causes the shoot to droop and defoliate. In larger twigs it may allow entry of disease organisms. The burden of feeding of the nymphs is also considerable. However, it has been shown that there is little long-term harm to mature trees. Alleged reward for blue eyed cicadas A popular reoccurring urban legend purports to say that rare blue (or white) eyed cicadas will fetch rewards of up to one million dollars. According to the legend, biological laboratories, particularly at Vanderbilt University, will pay a reward to any who catch such a specimen. And while it is true that blue eyed cicadas are extremely rare, occurring in only about one in every million insects, no laboratories currently offer any such reward. However, Roy Troutman, an American entomologist and cicada researcher, did in fact offer rewards for living blue eyed cicadas for cicada research in 2008. He is no longer offering rewards.

When reporting the event in a paper that a Swedish academic journal published in 1756, Kalm wrote: > The general opinion is that these insects appear in these fantastic numbers > in every seventeenth year. Meanwhile, except for an occasional one which may > appear in the summer, they remain underground. > There is considerable evidence that these insects appear every seventeenth > year in Pennsylvania. Kalm then described documents (including one that he had obtained from Benjamin Franklin) that had recorded in Pennsylvania the emergence from the ground of large numbers of cicadas during May 1715 and May 1732. He noted that the people who had prepared these documents had made no such reports in other years. Kalm further noted that others had informed him that they had seen cicadas only occasionally before the insects appeared in large swarms during 1749. He additionally stated that he had not heard any cicadas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1750 in the same months and areas in which he had heard many in 1749. The 1715 and 1732 reports, when coupled with his own 1749 and 1750 observations, supported the previous \\"general opinion\\" that he had cited. Kalm summarized his findings in a paper translated into English in 1771, stating: > There are a kind of Locusts which about every seventeen years come hither in > incredible numbers .... In the interval between the years when they are so > numerous, they are only seen or heard single in the woods. Based on Kalm's account and a specimen that Kalm had provided, Carl Linnaeus gave to the insect the Latin name of Cicada septendecim in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, which was published in Stockholm in 1758. In 1766, Moses Bartram described in his Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years the next appearance of the brood that Kalm had observed in 1749. Bartram noted that upon hatching from eggs deposited in the twigs of trees, the young insects ran down to the earth and \\"entered the first opening that they could find\\". He reported that he had been able to discover them below the surface, but that others had reportedly found them deep. In 1775, Thomas Jefferson recorded in his \\"Garden Book\\" the insect's 17-year periodicity, writing that an acquaintance remembered \\"great locust years\\" in 1724 and 1741, that he and others recalled another such year in 1754 and that the insects had again emerged from the ground at Monticello in 1775. He noted that the females lay their eggs in the small twigs of trees while above ground. In April 1800, Benjamin Banneker, who lived near Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, wrote in his record book that he recalled a \\"great locust year\\" in 1749, a second in 1766 during which the insects appeared to be \\"full as numerous as the first\\", and a third in 1783. He predicted that the insects \\"may be expected again in the year 1800, which is seventeen years since their third appearance to me\\".(1) (2) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Taphurini Category:Hemiptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Magicicada septendecim"},{"id":"12703823","text":"Magicicada septendecula is a species of insect in family Cicadidae.

Similar to the structure and authority of municipal police departments in British Columbia, OCABC is an independent policing agency. The specific mandate of OCABC is to facilitate the disruption and suppression of organized crime which impacts all British Columbians. The Organized Crime Agency of BC (OCABC) was created in direct response to the recommendations of the report of the Organized Crime Independent Review Committee, chaired by Stephen Owen (‚ÄúThe Owen Report,‚Äù September 15, 1998). The Agency was incorporated as a Society in March 1999 under the BC Police Act to replace its forerunner, the Coordinated Law Enforcement Unit (CLEU). The Owen Report found CLEU to be ‚Äú‚Ä¶ not sufficiently equipped, mandated or able to cope with the growing sophistication and diversity of organized crime‚Äù. OCABC became fully operational in February 2000, similar in structure and authority to other municipal police departments in British Columbia. As a designated Police Agency in the province of British Columbia, the Organized Crime Agency of BC has its own contingent of sworn law enforcement officers and civilian personnel, and is responsible for: ‚ÄúProviding designated Policing and designated Law Enforcement to reduce and eliminate organized crime and other significant criminal activity in British Columbia‚Äù. OCABC derives its powers from Section 4.1 (2) (c) and 18.1 (d) of the Police Act. Structure During Hon. Rich Coleman‚Äôs term as Solicitor General, the province increased its move toward more integration in policing as both a cost-saving measure by reducing duplication of efforts, and in order to solidify the Agency‚Äôs impact as an aggressive organized crime fighting unit. In 2004, this restructuring aligned OCABC with its law enforcement partners into the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit ‚Äì British Columbia (‚ÄúCFSEU-BC‚Äù). It is under this agency name that organized crime projects are investigated and prosecuted. CFSEU-BC integrated 14 law enforcement agencies, including OCABC and the RCMP, under one single command structure with oversight provided by a Chief Superintendent. The intent was to integrate the Organized Crime Agency of British Columbia, municipal police and the RCMP into one combined unit to coordinate the province‚Äôs response to the growing threat of organized crime and gang violence. Operations In 2002-2003, the agency participated in Project Blizzard with Alberta and U.S. authorities in investigating drug trafficking. This project had 689,000 pseudoephedrine tablets, 64.7 kilograms of cocaine, 3,353 pounds of marijuana, and $4 million seized. The 5-month Project Longhaul in 2003 investigated distribution and transportation of marijuana, ecstasy, and ephedrine from British Columbia to Ontario and the U.S. and resulted in 3,872 pounds of marijuana, 20,000 tablets of ecstasy, and 218.2 kilograms of ephedrine being seized. Project Longhaul II specifically focused on BC Bud and had 1,595 pounds of marijuana, and 461 marijuana plant clones seized.OCA 2003/2004, 8-9.

Stanley Sarnoff established the fellowship for medical students in 1979 and it would serve as a prototype for later programs such as the American Heart Association Student Research Scholarship program and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute NIH Research Scholars program, or cloisters program, which would not begin until 1984. Stanley Sarnoff Dr. Sarnoff, a graduate of Princeton University and The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, was a scientist, entrepreneur and scholar who early in his career served as Assistant Professor of Physiology at the Harvard University School of Public Health. For a decade he was Chief of the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology at the National Heart Institute. He later founded Rodana Research Corporation and its successor, Survival Technology, Inc., a company today known as Meridian Medical Technologies, which manufactures medical devices. At Dr. Sarnoff's death in 1990, his will named The Sarnoff Foundation the principal beneficiary of his Estate, valued shortly after his death at nearly $30 million.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/25/obituaries/stanley-j- sarnoff-72-cardiologist-and-inventor.html Goals of the fellowship Sarnoff based the program on his experience with Myron Weisfeldt, a young medical student in his lab, from which he established a set of simple rules for the fellowship: the medical student would leave school for one year, work in the laboratory of a prominent cardiovascular scientist conducting his own research and participate as if he were an independent researcher. At the conclusion of his year, the student would report his findings to his mentors. As the fellowship grew, students would attend a yearly meeting and present their findings to their peers and to the Sarnoff Cardiovascular research community of mentors, advisors and past fellows. A major emphasis of these meetings was on Dr Sarnoff's question, \\"Did you have fun?\\" Sarnoff wanted the fellows to be caught up in the joys of scientific research and discovery. The year was intended to expose students to the rewards of scientific research but it was more than that; it was a way to encourage the students to examine other ways of thinking, other career paths. No project was a failure if the experiment failed because failure opened the way to other findings. If the student learned something about himself and his choices then he had succeeded. How the fellowship works As a junior fellow, the student is given funding to conduct a year of cardiovascular research at a laboratory outside their home institution (which should be a medical school in the United States). This includes a stipend as well as funds for traveling to interview with laboratories across the country, for moving expenses, for health insurance and computer equipment, and for financial support to attend meetings and conferences. The organization gives each junior fellow an established cardiovascular researcher to be their mentor. Mentors help students select and integrate into an appropriate lab; they will also monitor the student‚Äôs research experience during the fellowship year. After completion of the research year, the student becomes a Senior Fellow and is funded to attend the Annual Scientific Meeting for the duration of their life. Career guidance and research mentorship continues to be available from the student‚Äôs Sarnoff mentor, the Sarnoff scientific board and the greater Sarnoff Community. Additional research funding through the Scholars Program is available to Senior Fellows. Awardee Profile Sarnoff Fellowships are awarded based upon the student‚Äôs research interests and research proposal. Although many applicants have had a wide array of research experiences, the fellowship program is also interested in fostering students who have had none but who are interested in cardiovascular research. Over 300 fellows and 30 scholars have completed the program, many of whom choose to pursue academic research or to pursue their research within industry or business. It remains a small and tight knit community linked by the members' interest in cardiovascular research. Of those fellows who choose to practice medicine, the majority refer to their time as a Sarnoff Fellow as some of the most rewarding of their training and the alumni organization exists \\"with sincere thanks to Stanley Sarnoff for his unconditional gift.\\" Some Notable Alumni * Myron Weisfeldt, MD (medical student who trained with Dr. Sarnoff;http://www.sarnoffendowment.org/about/history.cfm basis for establishment of Fellowship), Chair of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Medicine/admin/welcome.html * John McVicar, MD (1980-81 Sarnoff Fellow), Director of Liver Transplantation, University of California, Davis Medical Center. * Richard D.

It was the first design for Chantiers A√©ro-Maritimes de la Seine (CAMS) by the company's new head designer, Maurice Hurel. The prototype was displayed at the 1926 Salon de l'A√©ronautique in Paris. The prototype first flew in 1926, and after testing was ordered into service before the end of the year. It was a conventional biplane flying boat very similar to previous CAMS designs, being driven by a pusher propeller whose engine was mounted on struts in the interplane gap. The first production version was the amphibious CAMS 37A that was bought by the French Navy, the Portuguese Navy and the aeroclub of Martinique.

Some of the type's most significant moments were trials conducted by Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique on the SS √éle de France to evaluate the feasibility of catapult-launched mailplanes for their transatlantic liners using two specially-built 37/10s. Another famous use of the aircraft was on Ren√© Guilbaud's long-range flight through Africa and the Mediterranean between 12 October 1927 and 9 March 1927, venturing as far as Madagascar before returning to Marseille. In the course of the flight, he covered in 38 stages without incident. The CAMS 37 was gradually phased out of operational service in the mid-to-late 1930s, and by the time World War II started in September 1939, the aircraft had been relegated to training and communication roles. On mobilisation, however, CAMS 37/11 trainers were used by two units for coastal patrol, with one unit, Escadrille 2S2 continuing in service until August 1940. Outside mainland France, CAMS 37/11 trainers continued in use with a Free French unit in Tahiti until 15 January 1941, and with a Vichy France unit in Indochina until 1942 Variants CAMS 37 photo from Annuaire de L'A√©ronautique 1931 ;37:Flying boat prototype, (one built). ;37A:amphibious version (185 built). ;37/2:pure flying boat version incorporating refinements from 37A amphibian (45 built). ;37 A/3:reinforced hull (two built). ;37 A/6:enclosed cabin admiral's barge for A√©ronavale (three built). ;37A/7:(or 37Lia) liaison amphibian (36 built). ;37A/9:metal-hulled officer transport for French Navy (4 built). ;37/10:version for catapult trials (two built). ;37/11:Four-seat liaison / trainer wooden-hulled version (110 built). ;37/12:civil version with enclosed four-seat cabin (one built). ;37/13:(or 37bis) metal-hulled version for catapult launching from ships. ;37GRCAMS 37GR photo from L'A√©rophile December,1926:(GR ‚Äì Grand Raids) A single long-range aircraft converted for the 37C prototype, flown by Lieutenant de Vaisseau Guilbaud, from l'Etang de Berre, in the company of Lior√©-Olivier LeO H-194 on 12 October 1926, for a proving flight to Madagascar.

The species was first found by G. F. Matthew and described in 1876 by Selys-Longchamps. Classified as an endemic species, the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly can only be found in the forests of the Hawaiian Islands. Derived from a freshwater ancestor, the genus Megalarion consists of very diversified groups of damselflies that can grow between the lengths of 33 to 37 millimeters. Megalagrion xanthomelas are commonly found in calm water sources throughout Hawaii including streams and ponds and is threatened by habitat loss. . Anchialine ponds are a common habitat for Megalagrion xanthomelas to live in which requires the species to adapt to mechanisms of osmoregulation, which helps maintain their internal fluids when the surrounding salinity of the water fluctuates. Osmoregulation resulted in the species adapting behaviorally to finding habitats that have lower salinity levels. Osmoregulation leads to an increase in diversity within the species causing western coast populations to adapt and be less sensitive to higher salinity habitats, creating a salinity tolerance, while eastern coast populations lack a high salinity tolerance.  Diversity  Since the genus Megalagrion is native to the Hawaiian Islands, the species has been exposed to adaptive radiation causing varieties within the species especially in color. Due to adaptive radiation within Hawaiian Megalagrion damselflies, species exhibit a variety of colors ranging from blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Megalagrion xanthomelas have red males and brown females which results in the species being named the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly. Megalagrion xanthomelas is classified as a sexually dimorphic species since male and female damselflies are different colors. There is an exception to this dimorphic characteristic which is when the species is located at a higher elevation than normal causing both males and females to be red. This kind of natural selection was created because the red pigmentation now found in both males and females protects the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselflies from ultraviolet damage.  Populations declining  Around the early 1900s, Megalagrion xanthomelas was one of the most common species found on the Hawaiian Islands. After World War II, Megalagrion xanthomelas showed an extremely fast decline in population numbers, resulting in many Hawaiian Islands no longer being the home for any populations since the 1990s. In 1994, the species Megalagrion xanthomelas was placed on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Federal Register and protected under the Endangered Species Act. Later in 1996, Megalagrion xanthomelas would be listed as a vulnerable species and this was the last time the species was assessed by the IUCN. The last time the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly was assessed was on January 18, 2019 and the species was listed as an endangered species.  Habitat  An image of the multiple islands that make up the state Hawaii.  Common habitats  Megalagrion xanthomelas is commonly found near the coastal wetlands of the Hawaiian Islands. The species is also found in wetlands fed by basal springs and different levels of elevation throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Megalagrion xanthomelas is usually found between the range of 60 to 610 meters above sea level, with some populations recorded as high as 1000 meters above sea level. Megalagrion xanthomelas thrive in habitats that have tall Guinea grass lining the perimeter of the water source. Females will use the tall leaves of the Guinea grass to lay their eggs onto when mating while males perch on top of the leaves waiting to chase out intruder males. The inlet of Pearl Harbor used to be a common habitat for the species Megalagrion xanthomelas. After World War II, Megalagrion xanthomelas declined in numbers over the years and is no longer present within the inlet of Pearl Harbor. The decrease in numbers is thanks to civilian and military airport traffic and housing that was constructed within the inlet creating a military base.  Anchialine ponds  An example of an anchialine pond where many Megalagrion species, including Megalagrion xanthomelas, inhabits. Anchialine ponds are the most common habitat for Megalagrion xanthomelas since this type of water source is found in low-lying areas within the Hawaiian Islands. Anchialine ponds are created when a water source is contaminated with groundwater and has no direct connection with a larger body of water, like an ocean or a sea. Anchialine ponds are known for their salinity levels which can be caused by the mixing of groundwater with the original water source. Anchialine ponds have fluctuating salinity and temperature levels since these types of ponds are commonly found when there is a mixture of cold freshwater and warm saltwater. Temperature and salinity are two major components that factor how well a population will survive and flourish within their environment.  Salinity levels  Salinity is the most powerful component out of the two since freshwater recharge, like precipitation, and evaporation can change the level of salinity causing it to fluctuate. The average annual rainfall within the Hawaiian Islands is about 300 centimeters which could impact the salinity levels within anchialine ponds. The average salinity of east coast anchialine ponds is held around 3.5 ppt while west coast anchialine ponds have a salinity held at about 7.0 ppt. With varying levels of salinity and the possibility of salinity levels fluctuating, populations within the species Megalagrion xanthomelas have adapted to live within different levels of salinity.Megalagrion xanthomelas perching on a maple leaf.  Introduction of other species  Megalagrion xanthomelas live within the same habitat shared by already existing species of dragonflies and damselflies along with other introduced species on the Hawaiian Islands. ‚ÄúOther species of dragonflies and damselflies that the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly shares a habitat with are Ischnura posita, Tramea abdominalis, and Paniala flavescens‚Äù. All three of these dragonfly and damselfly species do not affect the survival rate of the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly. Over the past century, different species of fish have been added to water sources within the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly's habitat. The appearances of these fish species have resulted in the decline of population numbers within these Hawaiian Island habitats.  Life cycle  A comparison between the different colors of a male and female Megalagrion xanthomelas. The red male is located above the brown female. The life cycle of Megalagrion xanthomelas is done fully within water sources that have a salinity level lower than 8 ppt (Tango). The order Odonata, including Megalagrion xanthomelas, undergo incomplete metamorphosis within their life cycles. The life cycle of the Megalagrion xanthomelas contains four stages. The first stage of the life cycle is the egg stage which lasts about 21 days before the larva emerges. Next, is the pre-larva which takes anywhere between 11 and 17 days to complete. The third stage is the naiad, naiads can develop from a range of 103 to 111 days. The last stage is the adult, which is the only stage that doesn't require water to be completed. When females lay their eggs, they lay their eggs fully submerged within aquatic plants. When the eggs are laid, they are covered by an outer shell called a chorion. The chorion provides a structure that allows for the intake of oxygen while preventing any level of salinity from entering and killing the baby organism inside. After the life cycle is completed, the adult stage of Megalagrion xanthomelas can decide on looking for another habitat to reproduce in or staying near the water source itself emerged from.  Environmental problems = Urbanization  Megalagrion xanthomelas is a species particularly vulnerable to any type of habitat degradation or alteration. Habitat degradation can be caused by urbanization resulting in Megalagrion xanthomelas being forced into smaller habitat areas. Megalagrion xanthomelas used to be so abundant back in the 1800s, that fields and any shallow water source would be swarmed with Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselflies. During the 20th century, urbanization would start taking over the natural habitats supplied by the Hawaiian Islands. Water sources were channelized, filled, or turned into mangroves which led to a decrease in water quality for many species, including Megalagrion xanthomelas. One event that led to the decline of Megalagrion xanthomelas population numbers was the attack on Pearl Harbor. The inlet of Pearl Harbor used to be shallow and housed many species, but by the end of World War II, the inlet turned into a civilian and military airport and community. Later, further degradation would occur in the area when the Veterans Administration would order for the construction of the Pearl Harbor Memorial. The resulting impact of all this construction would lead to the elimination of any remaining populations of Megalagrion xanthomelas and an increase in the salinity level within the inlet.  Invasive species  Xiphophorus helleri is an invasive predator species of the Megalagrion xanthomelas. The introduction of invasive species has been a major threat to most aquatic habitats within the Hawaiian Islands and has been the main cause of the decline in population numbers for Megalagrion xanthomelas. Invasive fish species that are introduced to the Hawaiian Island habitats have increased the vulnerability of many Odonata species, including Megalagrion xanthomelas. ‚ÄúSome of these invasive fish species include Xiphophorus helleri, Poecilia mexicana, Poecilia reticulata, and Gambusia‚Äù. Populations of Megalagrion xanthomelas are higher in areas without any introduction of invasive fish species compared to areas that have invasive fish species. Megalagrion xanthomelas can survive with the presence of some invasive species including carp and apple snails. The introduction of invasive species doesn't only introduce predators into the environment, it also introduces new diseases and parasites that native species, like Megalagrion xanthomelas, can not survive from.  Weather  The species Megalagrion xanthomelas is extremely sensitive to increased salinity levels and any fluctuation outside the normal range of salinity which can lead to a decline in population numbers. Anchialine ponds, which are the most common habitat for Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselflies, are very susceptible to increased groundwater withdrawals leading to an increase in the salinity level. An increase in salinity level results in an increase in osmolarity creating a higher demand for osmoregulation. With an increase in osmoregulation, the survival of naiads starts to decrease since this stage of the life cycle no longer has a chorion or the ability to osmoregulate. If naiads are not surviving, then whole populations have the potential to be wiped out before the adults have a chance to breed again.  Conservation methods = Research studies  There has been a very little amount of studies, research, and experiments completed on the species Megalagrion xanthomelas. This results in an insufficient amount of information being available on the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly, making it very hard to learn how the species behaves, functions within its habitat, and how to better protect this endangered species from becoming extinct. To help protect the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly from extinction, baseline research needs to be conducted and completed so conservation biologists, or anyone who wants to help protect this species, has the right information. Comparative studies between the responses of younger and older life stages to the salinity level of the water source can help determine what information is needed to increase their survival rate within their habitat. Focus primarily on the naiad since that stage of the life cycle is completed in the water and has no way to osmoregulate or protect itself from the high salinity levels that might occur within its habitat.  Habitat stability  The habitat for Megalagrion xanthomelas is commonly anchialine ponds that are very susceptible to pollution, degradation, alteration, and the introduction of invasive species. The habitat for Megalagrion xanthomelas could be contaminated by pollutants due to sediment being pushed into water sources around construction sites and roads. Pollution and sediment results in poor water quality for the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly to live in and reproduce. There should be strong conservation methods on anchialine pond water quality and quantity which ensures their habitat is sufficient enough to reproduce and create more anchialine populations. Degradation of the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly is caused by urbanization like constructing developments or roads into their habitats. Urbanization causes habitat alteration by decreasing the habitat size resulting in populations of Megalagrion xanthomelas being confined into small areas not suitable for their species or number. Confining them within a smaller habitat area makes them more susceptible to predators and invasive species. If there are too many different types of invasive species within the original habitat for Megalagrion xanthomelas, the best conservation method is to relocate the populations since invasive species are hard to maintain and eradicate once they are established. Whether the Orangeblack Hawaiian Damselfly is relocated to another natural anchialine pond or an artificially made one, the species will flourish and reestablish without the influence of invasive species.

It is native to Panama. M. symmetochus was discovered by William M. Wheeler in late July 1924 in the fungus gardens of the attine Sericomyrmex amabilis of Barro Colorado Island. Description head of worker and male, thorax + pedicel of worker, forewing of female Workers are 3 to 3.5 mm long, with small, feebly convex eyes, that are probably adapted to living within the dark fungal gardens of their host. Very small ocelli are only sometimes present. Workers are yellowish red, with mandibles, funiculi, the posterior half of the first segment of the gaster and the sutures of the thorax and pedicels brown. The tip of the gaster is yellowish. The female is almost 4 mm long. She has larger eyes than the workers and distinct ocelli. Otherwise, they look very similar to workers. Each ocellus has a black margin internally. The wings are yellowish hyaline and iridescent, with veins and pterostigma pale yellow. The membranes of the wings are distinctly pubescent. Males are almost 3 mm long. They bear very large eyes and ocelli. Their body form is very similar to that of workers and females, but with smooth sides of the thorax. The wings have longer pubescence that in the female. Males are brownish yellow, with a little darker gaster and slightly paler antennae and legs. The eyes and a spot along the inner border of each ocellus are black.  Behavior  M. Symmetochus often live among and take from the gardens of fungus-growing ants, sometimes usurping the gardens. In some populations they coexist with fungus-growing hosts >80% of the time. They number their hosts as much as 1:3. Young queens stealthily invade fungus-growing colonies and start their own lineage in the fungus garden. Then, they clip the wings of the hosts' virgin queens, but not the males. When their hosts live near predators who destroy the nests and destroy their gardens, M. Symmetochus serves as protection of their host colonies. Hundreds of worker ants live throughout the nest of the host, and when invaders attack, individuals recruit the others inside to defend the nest. Also, these ants have been observed projecting their stings, leaving two isomers of 3-butyl-5-hexylpyrrolizidine, marking the nest with the scent of its toxin. It seems that some species avoid nests with their marked scent. When there are no invaders, M. Symmetochus commonly have aggressive conflict with their hosts. Therefore, it seems that when M. Symmetochus lives with a host with no outside danger, they serve as parasites, but when the hosts live near other threats, they have a mutualistic relationship with their hosts.

The genus is known only from the Neotropics, where some of the species are specialized parasites or predators of Attini. Description It is difficult to characterize morphologically. Bolton (2003) placed it in the tribe Solenopsidini, but with multiple exceptions to the diagnostic characters for the tribe. The tribal characters include a bicarinate clypeus and a median clypeal seta. Most Megalomyrmex species have a smoothly convex clypeus with no trace of the bicarinate condition, and most have abundant clypeal setae with no distinct or differentiated median seta. In Bolton's (1994) key to genera, Megalomyrmex keys in multiple places because of variability in mandibular dentition. Nevertheless, the genus has a distinctive habitus: the antenna is 12-segmented with a 3-segmented club; the general integument is smooth and shiny without coarse sculpture or dull areas; the promesonotum is evenly arched, without promesonotal groove; the propodeum is usually smoothly curved between dorsal and posterior faces, at most with blunt, broad-based tubercles, and never with spines; and the hind tibial spur is simple. In short, the workers look like a Solenopsis with Pheidole antennae. The mandibular dentition varies from a simple set of 5 similar teeth on the masticatory margin, gradually diminishing in size basally, to a condition with 2 large apical teeth followed by up to 12 small denticles. Some species have unusual alkaloids. The hypothesis that alkaloids act at a distance converges with what is known for the genera Solenopsis, Monomorium and Megalomyrmex when workers release volatile venom alkaloids by waving their stingers (i.e., gaster flagging) during interspecific encounters causing their enemies to flee. It is close to Monomorium and should possibly be included in the latter. Distribution and habitat Although widespread in the Neotropics, from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, Megalomyrmex species are never abundant. They occur in low to middle elevation wet to dry forest habitats. Some species are free-living with large diffuse nests in the soil (e.g. Megalomyrmex modestus) or small nests in dead wood (e.g. Megalomyrmex drifti). Others are specialized social parasites or predators of Attini (e.g. Megalomyrmex adamsae, Megalomyrmex mondabora, Megalomyrmex symmetochus, Megalomyrmex wettereri).

In 31 games for the Royals, he averaged 3.2 points and 3.1 rebounds in eight minutes per game. Then, on February 1, 1968, he was part of a big trade which sent him and Happy Hairston to the Detroit Pistons for Tom Van Arsdale and John Tresvant. His playing time increased to over 15 minutes per game in 24 games for the Pistons, and he averaged 4.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. The following season, 1968‚Äì69, Fox again was part of a midseason trade. In 25 games for the Pistons, he averaged 5.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game before being traded on December 17, 1968, along with a third-round draft pick to the Phoenix Suns for McCoy McLemore. He found success with the Suns‚Äîhe became a starter, averaging over 38 minutes per game and career-high 13.8 points and 13.3 rebounds along with 2.8 assists per game. In 1969‚Äì70, he played the entire season for the Suns. Averaging 25 minutes per game in 81 games, he averaged 12.9 points and 7.0 rebounds per game with a career-best .524 field goal percentage. Just after the completion of the 1969‚Äì70 season, on April 23, 1970, Fox was again traded, this time along with a second-round draft pick to the Chicago Bulls for Clem Haskins. For the 1970‚Äì21 season with the Bulls, Fox played in all 82 games, averaging 9.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. In 1971‚Äì72, Fox played in 10 games for the Bulls before being traded again, this time along with a second- round draft pick back to the Cincinnati Royals for Norm Van Lier and a third- round pick. For the season, in 81 games, he averaged 11.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. On October 9, 1972, Fox was on the move yet again. The Kansas City-Omaha Kings (formerly the Cincinnati Royals) traded him along with Dick Gibbs to the Seattle SuperSonics for a second-round pick. In the 1972‚Äì73 season, he averaged 11.4 points and a career second-best 11.2 rebounds per game. In 1973‚Äì74 he had another fine season with the Sonics, averaging 11.3 points and 9.2 rebounds along with a career-best 2.9 assists per game.

Northwest hip hop music mixes elements from various genres of music to form a sound different from its southern neighbor, West Coast hip hop. For many years the scene existed mainly as an underground genre, but recently Northwest hip-hop has seen more and more mainstream acceptance, with artists such as Macklemore gaining nationwide attention. History= Pre-1993  During the late 1970s, high school kids from the Rainier Beach, Rainier Valley, and Central District areas in Seattle started to perfect early hip hop forms of dancing in the northwest defined as bopping. Many of the local underage clubs and high schools in south Seattle held formal contests called bop-offs where dancers would compete against one another. In the early 1980s, soldiers positioned at Tacoma's military bases provided the foundation for a growing hip-hop fan base in the Northwest. This increased demand for hip-hop coincided with some of the first hip-hop dances in Seattle, which were held at public-housing recreation centers and featured the Emerald Street Boys and Anthony \\"Sir Mix-A-Lot\\" Ray. Simultaneously, \\"Nasty Nes\\" Rodriguez launched the West Coast's first all-rap radio program, \\"Fresh Tracks,\\" and soon Nasty Nes began airing self-produced tracks by Sir Mix-A-Lot, as well as the Emerald Street Boys, MC LeRap, PDQ, and Andy Hamlin. Fresh Tracks was a two hour show that played on Sunday nights on KKFX 1250 (\\"KFOX\\" and formerly KKDZ), and consisted of a mix of new songs and a mastermix created by Nasty Nes. These mixes were made up of songs by The World's Famous Supreme Team, Malcolm McLaren, Run-D.M.C. and many others. Due to the show's popularity, the station's producer allowed Nes to expand it to a Monday through Friday, 9pm to midnight show called NightBeat that featured prominent R&B; songs as well as intermixed rap songs. As Seattle's music scene evolved, so did the Seattle breakdance and graffiti crews, including B-Boy groups like Silver Chain Gang, Circuit Breakers, and Breaking Mechanism, and graffiti writers such as Spaide, Streak, DadOne, and Spraycan. At this time the Northwest was considered an empty canvas, which lagged behind other regions in creating a unique identity that was associated with hip hop. With this space there was room for an eclectic group of identities to form, however none were successful in formulating a Seattle identity.Murray Forman (2000). ‚ÄòRepresent‚Äô: race, space and place in rap music. Popular Music, 19, pp 65-90. In 1986, the first radio show in Spokane to play rap and hip hop on commercial radio was ‚ÄúThe Power Switch‚Äù on POWER 104 FM (KXVO). Hosted by TJ Collins, Collins also featured local rappers and began airing mixes by GrandMixer GMS (who was a young teenager at the time). (PROP$ Magazine article, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 12, Dec. 1993). In 1985 Nastymix Records, the Northwest's first hip-hop label was founded with the local release of Sir Mix-A-Lot's \\"Square Dance Rap\\", which sold approximately 75,000 copies. Nastymix Records gained national recognition with Sir Mix-A-Lot's 1988 \\"Posse on Broadway\\", and reached its peak in 1993 with Mix's Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for \\"Baby Got Back.\\" Unfortunately this award came after Nastymix's last release, Criminal Nation's 1992 album Trouble in the Hood. 1993 to 2002 Seattle hip-hop culture was confined to the only venues that would play hip-hop, all of which were in Seattle's traditionally African-American neighborhood, the Central District (referred to in Seattle as \\"The CD\\".) In 1993, Jonathon \\"Wordsayer\\" Moore of Source of Labor approached Caroline Davenport of Tasty Shows, who was responsible for booking a popular Seattle venue called RCKCNDY. In 1996 a venue called the Power Plant, 825 Western Ave, Seattle (now a Dania Furniture store 2015)became a popular venue on Saturday nights with a hip hop group called The High Children. Home for B-Boys, break-dance battles and hosted the legendary Invisible Scratch Pickles versus X-men} The alternative/grunge music scene soon dominated the Northwest's musical image, and in both Seattle and Portland this contributed to the troubled adolescence of local hip-hop. The Teen Dance Ordinance, which had been in effect since 1985, made it almost impossible for most Seattle venues to book all-ages shows. The social turmoil of Seattle during the late 1990s (The World Trade Organization Protest), the city's outspoken political opposition to President George W. Bush, and the despised Teen Dance Ordinance characterized the socially conscious style that defined Northwest hip-hop after 1993, a style that was continually strengthened as the hip-hop culture was attacked and labeled as violent and disruptive. However, production companies grew in NW like Winetime productions producing in the 1990s for national artist like The Click, Celly cell, E40 and more. Winetime took then midwest/local Artist Tony-O and climbed the billboard charts in 1998 and 99 peaking at #14 in Rap Singles with a song called PHD (Playa hata degree). Rap artist Tony-O is the only NW artist other than Mix A Lot until Macklemore to top the billboard charts in hip-hop at that time. In 2002 the Teen Dance Ordinance was lifted and replaced by the less draconian All-ages Dance Ordinance and hip-hop began its Northwest resurgence. 2002 to present The departure of the Teen Dance Ordinance in 2002 meant small Seattle venues could afford to host local hip-hop shows. Currently, the Northwest maintains a self-perpetuating underground hip-hop movement, a culture that is maintained almost entirely by word of mouth, local interest, and internet exposure. The Minneapolis-based Rhymesayers Entertainment, a quickly growing record label, has signed multiple artists from Seattle such as Boom Bap Project, Grayskul, Grieves, Jake One, and Vitamin D, which also contributes to its growth. Blue Scholars and their label Massline Media are also beginning to receive national attention. Macklemore is a hip hop artist from the Pacific Northwest who received much national and international attention. At the 56th Annual Grammy Award, Macklemore received seven Grammy award nominations, and won four of those, including the awards for Best New Artist, Best Rap Album (The Heist), Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance (Thrift Shop). However, Macklemore's success has been met with frustration from many local PNW hip hop artists who feel that Macklemore's status as a white, middle class male has led him to his popular position and feel disheartened that the underground artists are not better able to represent their city and region. http://www.greeneyedmedia.com/portfolio-item/the-blank- canvas-hip-hops-struggle-for-representation-in-seattle/ Ryan Lewis and Macklemore went on to self produce their first full-length album, \\"The Heist,\\" released in October 2012, and earned a 2014 Grammy for Best Rap Song for their national hit, Thrift Shop, and MTV Video Music Awards for Best Hip Hop Video, Best Video with a Social Message, and Best Cinematography, for Can't Hold Us, Same Love, and Can't Hold Us, respectively. In 2019, DJ Nasty Nes revived his classic radio show, KFOX Nightbeat, featuring songs he originally played on Fresh Tracks and Nightbeat, as well as exclusive new music (like he did on Fresh Tracks), and mastermixes by Spokane‚Äôs GrandMixer GMS. Keeping with the Sunday night tradition, KFOX Nightbeat is heard worldwide on both the TuneIn Radio and Rainier Avenue Radio apps every Sunday night from 9-11 (PST).  Hip hop dance  The hip hop dance crew Massive Monkees operate a community-based center for learning and positive change. Based in the International District in Seattle, the Beacon offers various arts programs in dance and music, as well as a free after-school program for youths as an alternative to street life. The Beacon strives to create a safe place for the community.  The Legacy of Seattle Hip-Hop at MOHAI  Seattle's Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) curated and showcased an exhibit called The Legacy of Seattle Hip Hop from September 19, 2015 through May 1, 2016. This exhibit was curated by Jazmyn Scott of The Town Entertainment and Aaron Walker-Loud of Big World Breaks. Items on display included Macklemore's fur jacket and scooter from his and Ryan Lewis' iconic \\"Thrift Shop\\" music video as well as Nasty Nes‚Äô NASTYMIX bomber jacket. There were several different sections of the exhibit focusing on different elements of Hip Hop culture. One section was devoted to music production. It featured two mixing stations that played tracks by Vitamin D and Jake One, as well as letting visitors interact with the tracks by using the mixing boards. Another section was dedicated to breakdancing, highlighting some of the early b-boys and b-girls in the Seattle scene as well as well-known groups like the Massive Monkees. In the middle of the floor was a raised dancing platform (Seattle Met article) and on the walls were items like a Boom Squad jersey from the group that used to perform during halftime at Seattle SuperSonics games.

Because the various species of Mesocyclops are known to prey on mosquito larvae, it is used as a nontoxic and inexpensive form of biological mosquito control. Biological control Individuals of Mesocyclops can be easily harvested, bred and released into freshwater containers where the Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae (the vector of Dengue fever) live. A big advantage of the Mesocyclops is that it is possible to teach schoolchildren how to recognize and collect them so that communities are able to perform sustainable mosquito control without much professional or governmental assistance. A field trial in Vietnam has shown that large-scale elimination of Aedes aegypti larvae is possible. Because Mesocyclops is a host for the parasitic round worm Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis, the causative agent of dracunculiasis), this method is potentially hazardous in the small number of countries where the Guinea worm still occurs.

Background Ali Kushayb's father was a member of the Ta‚Äôisha tribe while his mother was from the Dangaoni tribe from the southern part of Sudan. Ali Kushayb was an aqid al-ogada, a colonel of colonels, for the Wadi Salih area in Darfur.International Criminal Court. Warrant of Arrest For Ali Kushayb. (17) (27 April 2007). He was one of the senior leaders of the tribal hierarchy in the Wadi Salih locality, and was a member of the Popular Defence Forces (PDF), as well as a commander of a government backed militia in Darfur from August 2003 until March 2004. He served as a liaison between the government and the Janjaweed, while simultaneously participating in attacks against targeted groups.

Her husband was the first to be killed, and while she tried to run away she was caught by militia soldiers, and, at the command of Kushayb, was forced at knifepoint to confess she was \\"tora-bora,\\" or a rebel. After she arrived in Chad, other victims told similar stories of the horrors they underwent by the militia under the command of Kushayb: sixteen women were murdered, from which six were elderly women, children were thrown into a fire, houses were burned, countless were tortured and wounded, a dozen others were killed.

Warrant of Arrest For Ali Kushayb. (5) (27 April 2007). Kushayb was reported to be working for Ahmed Haroun. Eyewitnesses have reported meetings between Kushayb and Haroun. In one instance in August 2003, for example, Kushayb and Haroun supposedly met in the town of Mukluk, where Haroun provided money and arms to Kushayb for the militia. After their meeting Kushayb led the militia in an attack on the town of Bindisi. The attack lasted five days, during which more than 100 people were killed including 30 children. In December 2003 in the town of Arawala, a witness reported Kushayb inspecting her and other women who had been tied to a tree naked to be raped repeatedly by Janjaweed militia soldiers.\\"Prosecutor Opening Remarks.\\" International Criminal Court. 27 Feb. 2007. According to the ICC, Kushayb directly participated in the murder of 32 men in the town of Mukjar. Fifteen minutes after Kushayb and his soldiers took the men from the village, gunshots were heard and 32 dead bodies were found the next day. In another attack led by Kushayb near Mukjar, a man was arrested and told what he witnessed: \\"[The] men were restrained in different ways. Some of them ‚Ä¶ had been tied and suspended in the air‚Ä¶ His arms were held wide apart and tied to a plank of wood on the ceiling, while his legs were also held wide apart and tied to objects on either side ‚Ä¶ a stove was left burning between his legs‚Ä¶. All the men had whip marks on their bodies and their clothes were torn and blood- stained‚Ä¶ He had been repeatedly beaten, called \\"Tora Bora\\" and deprived of food‚Ä¶.

An ICC arrest warrant was issued for him and Ahmed Haroun, his co-defendant, on 27 April 2007. In April 2008, he was released from Sudanese custody. In October 2008, the Sudanese authorities re- arrested Kushayb. Kushayb appeared before the International Criminal Court on June 15, 2020. Fugitive status and arrest In April 2013, Kushayb, as commander of the Central Reserve Forces (Abu Tira) in Rahad el-Berdi in South Darfur, carried out a military attack with support from military intelligence forces after a peace treaty between the Salamat and al-Taaysha tribes had been signed. On 7 July 2013, Kushayb, his bodyguards, and a tea-seller standing nearby were injured by a gunman in Nyala. Kushayb was bleeding from his shoulders and admitted to the Nyala Police Hospital with two bullet wounds in his shoulder. One of the bodyguards died. Kushayb was transferred to a hospital in Khartoum. In December 2017, Kushayb was accused by leaders of the Salamat tribe of trying to kill Ali Osman Obeid, a cattle merchant, in Rahad el-Berdi. In June 2019, Kushayb remained a fugitive. Kushayb voluntarily surrendered himself for arrest in the Central African Republic (CAR) in June 2020 and was in ICC custody on 9 June 2020. According to local media, Kushayb had moved from Sudan to the CAR in February 2020, being worried about arrest by Sudanese authorities during the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy.

Original rescue buoys, also called can buoys. A rescue buoy or rescue tube or torpedo buoy is a piece of lifesaving equipment used in water rescue. This flotation device can help support the victim's and rescuer's weight to make a rescue easier. It is an essential part of the equipment that must be carried by lifeguards. It further can act as a mark of identification, identifying an individual as a lifeguard. Description A rescue buoy, also called a Burnside buoy, or can. The rescue tube is usually made of vinyl, and is buoyant enough to support the full weight of a rescuer and several victims. The tube has a long leash that the lifeguard wears around the body to tow the tube along while swimming a long distance. The rescue tube is usually red, but can come of a variety of colors. Rescue tubes often have the words \\"Guard\\" or \\"Lifeguard\\" printed on them. The tube may also have clips, so that it may be wrapped around a person. The rescue buoy is a hollow plastic rescue flotation device. It is referred to also as a Torpedo Buoy, because of its shape; and is often called a \\"Torp\\" for short by lifeguards. Because of its rigidity, it is slightly more hazardous in surf conditions. However, the rescue buoy generally has more buoyancy than a rescue tube, allowing the rescuer to assist multiple victims. There are several colors and sizes available commercially. The rails, or sides, or the buoy have handles allowing victims to grab on. Like the tube, the buoy is connect by a rope to a strap the rescuer wears. This allows them to swim while towing the buoy and victim. The buoy may also be connected to a landline device, which allows individuals onshore to pull the rescuer and victims back to shore. Early versions were constructed of aluminum, wood, cork, and fiberglass, with rope rails. History Walters with first Torpedo Buoy  Landline  A lifeguard would swim out the victim while attached to the line, clutch the victim, and would be rapidly pulled back to shore by others. This was inefficient as the line produced drag for the lifeguard and was at risk of becoming tangled. Another disadvantage was the need for two or more persons for operation; it was also inadequate in cases with multiple rescues simultaneously occurring at different locations.  Rescue Can  First created by Captain Henry Sheffield in 1897, the first \\"rescue can\\" was made of sheet metal and pointed at both ends. It caused little drag but occasionally produced harm to the lifeguard and the victim. As the design was switched from metal to aluminum with rounded ends, injuries would still occur. Walters Torpedo Buoy The Walters Torpedo Buoy was invented in 1919 by Henry Walters of the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Savings Corps.  Peterson Tube  Created in 1935, Pete Peterson produced an inflatable rescue tube with snap hooks molded onto one end and a 14-inch strap on the other. The design was further improved upon in the late 1960s with the production of closed-cell foam rubber. World War II rescue buoy See: Rescue buoy (Luftwaffe) During World War II, at the instigation of German Generaloberst Ernst Udet, large buoys were deployed in the English Channel for downed Luftwaffe flyers. Each included a enclosed cabin and a radio transmitter. One can be seen in the British films One of Our Aircraft is Missing (1942) and We Dive at Dawn (1943).  Burnside Buoy  Lt. Burnside coordinated with Professor Ron Rezek for the development of a plastic rescue buoy. A wood prototype was approved by the Board of Directors of the National Surf Line Saving Association in 1968.  Robotic rescue buoy  EMILY (Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard) is a robotic rescue buoy made by Hydronalix.EMILY  Usage  While approaching the victim, the lifeguard should allow the rescue buoy to trail behind. Once the lifeguard makes contact with the victim, they should hand over the rescue buoy to the victim and bring them ashore. The buoyancy of the rescue buoy, along with the reassuring talk, should comfort and calm the victim.  Water Entry  The three major components of a rescue floatation device (RFD) are the lanyard, float, and harness. The lanyard and harness can trip up the lifeguard during the entry run, so care must be taken upon handling the RFD. The lifeguard must carry the rescue buoy until the beach visitors are not at risk of getting hurt.  Removal from Water  If surf conditions are rough, the lifeguard may want to carry the rescue buoy completely out of the water. An unsecured rescue buoy could potentially wash up with force against the lifeguard or victim.  Fouling  Fouling occurs when the lanyard wraps around an object jeopardizing the lifeguard. The attachment between the lanyard and lifeguard must allow for quick release in case of emergencies.  Lanyard Length  The length of the lanyard is crucial, as it must help concise an efficient rescue. It must be long enough for the lifeguard to kick without the buoy in the way, and it must be short enough to avoid fouling.

To ensure accuracy, it is important to refer to base conditions when measuring the volume of a sample of liquid or gas. This applies to both static measurement and flow measurement. Pressure and temperature The density of both gases and liquids depends on the pressure and temperature of the fluid. Thus volumes measured in cold conditions or in pressurised conditions will be lower than the same mass of fluid at warmer or depressurised conditions. This fact gives rise to the necessity of choosing a benchmark pressure and temperature in which all 'net' volumes will be expressed. Ideal gas law The density of a gas at a specific pressure can be estimated by using the ideal gas law. Doubling absolute pressure doubles the density of a gas, and doubling absolute temperature halves the density. The number of molecules in a given gas volume depends on the pressure and temperature. This is why the pressure and temperature must be stated in order for a volume measurement to mean anything. Density correction Density correction is also performed on liquids under measurement. For instance, the sticker on gasoline pumps that states that the volume is corrected to 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F, or 60 ¬∞F in the U.S.) means that the measured volume has been compensated for thermal expansion. One would otherwise get a larger mass of gasoline in a tank filled in cold weather (which is unfair to the business) and less when it is warm (which is unfair to the consumer). UPDATE Gas at a filling station is stored underground and is therefore at a constant temperature. The outside temperature has no bearing on this constant ground temperature and therefore the pumped fuel will always be at that temperature and needs not be corrected to 15 degrees but measured at the ground temperature. Ground gets warmer and cooler with varying temperatures. You'd have to dig down pretty deep to keep it constant. Legal definitions Legal regulations usually require that sales to end customers be compensated to the legally defined base conditions. Where regulations do not require the use of a specific set of base conditions, contractual partners may be free to choose their own base conditions. Base conditions are often defined jurisdictionally. For example: Canada Pressure 101.325 kPa absolute, temperature 15 ¬∞C Electricity and Gas Inspection Regulations, SOR/86-131, sec. 2, Government of Canada, 1986 USA Pressure 14.696 psi absolute, temperature 60 ¬∞F Mexico Pressure 1 kgf/cm¬≤ (equivalent to 98.1 kPa absolute), temperature 20 ¬∞C Scientific definitionsFlow computers Flow computers generally need the base conditions for each flow meter to be configured.

Career He was called up on August 10, , to become the fifth starting pitcher in the Florida Marlins rotation, filling the empty spot after Florida sent Byung-hyun Kim to the Arizona Diamondbacks on waivers. He went to the bullpen when the Diamondbacks released Kim, and the Marlins picked him back up. Barone became a free agent at the end of the season.

He pitched to a 2‚Äì8 record with a 6.55 earned run average in 17 games that year between two teams in the A's minor league system and retired after the season. Barone joined the Kansas City T-Bones of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball and played for them during the 2014 season. High school life During high school Daniel Barone attended San Benito High School in Hollister, California. He was a stand-out pitcher for the Balers. On top of this he was also the shortstop at the high school, but would get designated hit for when it was his turn to bat. Though he was still able to hit as he does have a batting average as a major league pitcher. He hit .111 in his career. He had 11 plate appearances, 9 at bats, 1 hit, no base on balls or hit by pitch, 2 sacrifice bunts, and 1 run scored. After high school he had several scholarships, but took the one from Sonoma State.

It is placed in its own family, Mictocarididae, and is sometimes considered the only member of the order Mictacea. Mictocaris is endemic to anchialine caves in Bermuda, and grows up to long. Its biology is poorly known. Taxonomy Mictocaris halope is the only species in the genus Mictocaris, and in the family Mictocarididae. When the family Hirsutiidae is treated as the separate order Bochusacea, Mictocaris halope is the only species that remains in the order Mictacea. Description Mictocaris is long and is reflective. It is native to four anchialine limestone caves in Bermuda: it was first discovered by divers in Crystal Cave, and then further populations were found in Green Bay Cave (South Harrington Sound Passage and North Shore Passage), Roadside Cave and Tucker's Town Cave. Ecology Mictocaris is rarely encountered because it lives only in deep waters in the interior sections of the caves. It avoids sunlight and remains in isolated parts of the cave. It is usually seen swimming, but on rare occasions can be found resting or walking on a rock. When relocated into an aquarium, they prefer the walls and surfaces of the glass. It is unknown what Mictocaris eats, but it has developed powerful molar and mandible muscles which allows them to chew productively. When originally found, the divers collected 56 specimens of Mictocaris, which can now be found in the National Museum of Natural History. Conservation Mictocaris is critically endangered due to population fragmentation, a decline in subpopulations, and only inhabiting a single location. The population is only extant in five locations, some of which are likely experiencing habitat destruction.

The Qauqaut () was a Taiwanese aboriginal people who lived primarily in the town of Su-ao in Yilan County. They spoke the Basay language, which is a Kavalanic language. According to Japanese anthropologist In≈ç Kanori, the Qauqaut people had been assimilated by the Kavalan people by early 20th century. The Qauqaut people are not recognised by the government of Taiwan. According to oral tradition from various Atayal villages, the Qauqaut originally settled in the middle portion of the Takiri River (Chinese pinyin: Liwuhsi). In the mid-1700s, following pressure from Atayals, they moved to the east coast down the Takiri. Later, some moved north to Langsu in Nan'ao County. Early modern Chinese documents on the Kavalan territories reported that the Qauqaut were linguistically and culturally distinct from the other Formosan ethnic groups and that they did not intermarry with the other communities. Taiwanese linguist Paul Jen-kuei Li hypothesised that, in about 200 BCE, the Qauqaut migrated from Southeast Asia to the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands and in around 1000 AD arrived on the east coast of Taiwan, based on his linguistic comparison with the nearby Taroko (Seediq) language of Taiwan, which he said varies greatly from the Qauqaut. This contrasts with the rest of the Taiwanese aborigines, who are said to have arrived on the island much earlier. The Qauqaut bury the dead in a sitting position, like those of neighbouring villages in southern Kavalan territory.

As of 2013 it contains about 396 species.Monomorium. AntWeb. v5.1.17. It is distributed around the world, with many species native to the Old World tropics.Aldawood, A. S. and M. R. Sharaf. (2011). Monomorium dryhimi sp. n., a new ant species (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) of the M. monomorium group from Saudi Arabia, with a key to the Arabian Monomorium monomorium-group. ZooKeys 106, 47-54. It is considered to be \\"one of the more important groups of ants,\\" considering its widespread distribution, its diversity, and its variety of morphological and biological characteristics.Heterick, B. E. (2003). Two new Australian Monomorium Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), including a highly distinctive species. Australian Journal of Entomology 42(3), 249-53. It also includes several familiar pest species, such as the pharaoh ant (M. pharaonis) and the flower ant (M. floricola). Description This genus is very diverse in morphology, with species of many shapes and sizes that \\"do not necessarily even remotely resemble one another\\" at first glance. While the worker caste is monomorphic in some species, in others it is polymorphic. In some species the workers are minute, in others they are rather large. Large, multifaceted eyes are common, but M. inusuale has much reduced eyes, as do some species from Africa. The sting is always functional.Fern√°ndez, F. (2007). Two new South American species of Monomorium Mayr with taxonomic notes on the genus. In: Snelling, R. R., et al. (eds). Advances in ant systematics (Hymenoptera: Formicidae): homage to E. O. Wilson ‚Äì 50 years of contributions. Memoirs of the American Entomological Institute 80, 128-45. Taxonomy This large genus was further expanded in 2007, when the genera Nothidris, Epelysidris, and Phacota were synonymized with Monomorium. The small genera Anillomyrma, Megalomyrmex, and perhaps Bondroita should possibly also be included in Monomorium. The exact boundaries of the genus are yet to be determined. It has no distinct morphological trait that sets it apart from other genera in the tribe Solenopsidini. If cladistics were strictly applied, all Solenopsidini would be grouped in the single genus Solenopsis, but the tribe lacks a strong synapomorphy. Monomorium as it currently stands is paraphyletic, but it is used as a provisional group. Similar problems are found in the genera Camponotus and Leptothorax.Heterick, B. (2006). A revision of the Malagasy ants belonging to Genus Monomorium Mayr, 1855 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences 57(3), 69-202. Biology Most ants of this genus nest in rotting wood, under rocks, or in the soil. Some species are scavengers, while others are seed collectors.Mashaly, A. M. A., et al. (2010). Source, optimal dose concentration and longevity of trail pheromone in two Monomorium ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera). Journal of King Saud University-Science 22(1), 57-60. Many species have venom containing alkaloids, which they use as a defense from predators.Jones, T. H., et al. (2003). The venom alkaloids from some African Monomorium species. Journal of Chemical Ecology 29(12), 2721-27. Besides its morphological variation, the genus is also variable in chromosome number, with 2n of 16 to 70 recorded.Lorite, P., et al. (2002).

A sequel to the game, based on Mega Man 3, was released for DOS in 1992, skipping the second entry. The game has been heavily panned, with many calling it one of the worst PC games ever. Gameplay Gameplay of Mega Man Compared to the six \\"Robot Masters\\" from the original 1987 game, Mega Man has three \\"Masters\\" that can be selected: Dyna Man, Sonic Man, and Volt Man. In each level, the player- character, Mega Man, fights through various enemies and obstacles before facing the level's \\"Robot Master\\" boss at the level's end. Development Mega Man was developed by Stephen Rozner under his company Rozner Labs. Rozner had previous experience working with a Capcom intellectual property, having done a Commodore 64 port of Street Fighter. After Capcom U.S.A., Inc. purchased Riggs International, a small video game development company consisting of Rozner \\"an artist and the boss\\". Capcom intended to use Riggs International as an internal development studio but those plans never came to fruition. Rozner was then tasked with managing external developers. During this time, Rozner began work on Mega Man himself. During development, Rozner left Capcom U.S.A who agreed to allow Rozner to release the game once it was finished. Unable to access Capcom's asset files and assembly code, Rozner decided to start from scratch and make \\"whatever he wanted\\" since he was a fan of the original NES Mega Man games. It was released for DOS in 1990. Reception The game has been heavily panned, with many calling it one of the worst PC games of all time. PC Gamer put it on its list of the worst PC ports ever, calling it a \\"monstrous conversion\\" and a \\"terrible port\\". The game also made USGamer's list of the worst games on the Internet Archive, calling the level designs \\"uninspired\\" and the lack of music \\"the worst part\\". 1UP.coms Nadia Oxford listed it as one of the worst games in the Mega Man franchise. Jeremy Parish for Polygon ranked it as the worst game in the main series, calling it \\"a half-baked, unbalanced, hideous-looking game\\". Christian Nutt and Justin Speer for GameSpot called the game's controls and graphics \\"abysmal\\". Neil Foster of Hardcore Gaming 101 gave the game a negative write- up, while he found the addition of EGA visuals to be a plus, he found the graphics overall to be lacking in imagination when compared to the NES Mega Man games. He also panned the gameplay, which he considered \\"dull\\" and \\"cheap\\" with the level design making it \\"drag\\" and stating that \\"everything hits too hard and there‚Äôs little mercy invincibility in-between\\" leading to quick deaths. and said that it had enemies that are too short to shoot and narrow passages with low ceilings that made it difficult to make jumps. Foster also went on to pan the controls, saying that they make the game harder than it needs to be. Foster noted that some of the game's art assets were stolen and used in Duke Nukem. In his book \\"The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers\\", John Szczepaniak was less negative towards the game, considering it not to be as bad as fans of the series made it out to be.

These ants are large, measuring . During the time of its discovery, Douglas and Brown announced M. inquilina as the first social parasite among the primitive subfamilies, and today it is one of the two known Myrmecia species to have no worker caste. Two host species are known, Myrmecia nigriceps and Myrmecia vindex. Aggression between M. inquilina and its host species does not occur, and colonies may only produce M. inquilina brood months after the inquiline queens begin to lay their eggs. Queens eat the colony brood or trophic eggs, and other Myrmecia species may kill M. inquilina queens if they reject them. Due to its restricted distribution and threats to its habitat, the ant is \\"vulnerable\\" according to the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy Location of Wagin Before the discovery of M. inquilina, scientists believed that parasitic ants did not exist in the primitive ant subfamilies and were only known in Dolichoderinae, Formicinae and Myrmicinae; many authors believed that primitive ants lacked a certain trait that would prevent parasitic ants from forming, but the discovery of M. inquilina now hints possible parasitic lifeforms in Ponerinae and some army ants. Brown collected the first specimens in 1955 from large fallen trees in Western Australia, and it was officially announced as the first parasitic ant among the primitive subfamilies in 1956. In 1959, Australian naturalist Athol Douglas and American entomologist William Brown Jr. provided the first description of the ant in an Insectes Sociaux journal article. Its specific epithet inquilina derives from the word inquilinus, meaning \\"tenant\\". This name references the parasitic nature of the species, living inside a colony as a \\"guest\\" of another species. Brown discovered the holotype female from an M. vindex nest on 23 March 1955 northwest from Wagin at Badjanning Rocks, Western Australia. The specimen is currently housed in the Western Australian Museum in Perth. Two dealated paratype females were also collected with the holotype, looking very similar to each other except for the mandibles and colouration. The mandibular dentition varies among the three, and one of the paratypes is darker than the holotype. In 1991, a published journal reviewing the species groups assigned M. inquilina to the M. cephalotes species group. However, entomologists placed it in the M. gulosa species group one month after placing it in the M. cephalotes species group. Description M. inquilina is a large species, though it is smaller than its host. The body length of the ant is , the head including the clypeus is , the antennal scape and the diameter of the eyes are . The mandibles are slender with four to five acutely shaped teeth. The antennae are morphologically similar to M. vindex, but it is smaller in comparison; the petiole node is also longer and wider. The postpetiole is subtriangular and more narrow than those seen on M. vindex queens. The clypeus, legs and antennae are covered in punctulates (spots), and the postpetiole and gaster have less punctulates. M. inquilina can be distinguished from other ants due to its lack of pilose (long soft hairs); only small erect setae are mostly found on the mandibles and gastric apex, but short hair can be found on the legs, and on the dorsum, thorax and cervix. The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) finer and more abundant than M. vindex. The pubescence is greyish in colour, and it is shorter and more noticeable on the clypeus and appendages while it is conspicuous on the postpetiole and gaster. The colour of the head and gaster are black, shading into reddish brown on the clypeus and around the frontal carinae. The mesosoma (alitrunk), node, and legs are brownish-red and light, with the legs becoming yellowish in certain areas. The antennae and mandibles are brownish yellow, and the teeth have black edges. Overall, M. inquilina can be distinguished from others by its black head and its almost hairless body. Its colour is similar to M. nigriceps, but M. nigriceps is larger and covered in hair, along with a head more rounded than other species. M. inquilina does not have a worker caste, making it a workerless parasite. Five males collected from an M. vindex nest are presumed to be M. inquilina, but the similarities between the two species cannot confirm if the males are M. inquilina. While the males collected are morphologically similar to M. vindex males, the head and gaster are darker, and two specimens show a reddish-brown colour at the base of the first gastric segment, a characteristic that does not occur in M. vindex males. The genitalia is similar, but a more detailed study can distinguish these features among the two ants. Distribution and habitat M. inquilina is only found in the south-west of Western Australia, with the holotype collected 225 kilometres (140 miles) from Perth. M. inquilina occurs in colonies with M. vindex and M. nigriceps, found in soil, under logs and flat rocks in woodland. They are commonly found in granite outcrops and wooded areas, with trees such as Corymbia calophylla, Acacia acuminata and a large unidentified species of Allocasuarina (possibly Allocasuarina huegeliana) present. The type locality was in an area cleared for agricultural purposes, but some areas were still wooded; many fallen large trees were present. M. inquilina is typically found deep inside the nests, around 25 centimetres (10 inches) and can be found next to the queen. Behaviour and ecology M. inquilina is one of the two known Myrmecia species to not have a worker caste, and it is an inquiline to M. nigriceps and M. vindex colonies. M. inquilina is a polygynous species; colonies can house between two and several dozen queens, but some of them nesting in the colony are originally from there. Due to this, some M. inquilina females are ergatoid ants that lose their wings after eclosing in their cocoons. The parasitic queen(s) may only coexist indefinitely, but M. inquilina queens replace all host brood with their own eggs several months after infiltrating the nest. This only occurs if M. inquilina queens eat or destroy the brood laid by their host, and workers will even tend to the brood and protect it from potential invaders. M. inquilina queens tend to nest near the host queen and her brood, attended by worker ants without any form of aggression. Observations suggest that parasitic queens feed on trophic eggs laid by workers. Predatory threats only include other Myrmecia species; they are rejected by a potential host colony. For example, M. regularis workers immediately seize M. inquilina queens and kill it as soon as the two species come into contact. Aerial dispersion is important in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly after half an hour of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring. Status M. inquilina is the only species in its genus to be listed as \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN Red List. This, however, needs updating. Habitat loss may be responsible for the ant to be potentially endangered; Douglas and Brown note that a contamination of dieldrin spray to control the argentine ant destroyed many nests housing M. inquilina, and burn- offs are also a threat to colonies housing M. inquilina.

It was not discovered until after its extinction. Description The Antioch Dunes shield-back katydid is an orthopteran within the family Tettigoniidae (katydids and long-horned grasshoppers). It is considered large for a katydid species. Like all orthopterans, it has powerful hind legs that it uses for jumping and that help it to evade or confuse predators. Both the fore and hind legs are covered in small spines. The pronotum covers only the first tergite of the abdominal region. Connected at the base of the head, the pronotum lifts slightly off the body, hence the \\"shield-back\\". The abdomen has ten tergites or sections. They are light brown, with black mottling on the legs and antennae. Discovery There is no record of when the initial specimen was found. Neduba extincta was captured but never fully discovered. In the 1960s, Dave Rentz found an example of the species in a specimen drawer, however it was not identified or detailed. Rentz noted the unique morphology of its genitalia and the size of the specimen. In his research, he traveled to the Antioch Sand Dunes in California, where the specimen was originally collected, but he found no other living specimens. It took several years of researching until he was finally able to identify the species as Neduba extincta. The Antioch Sand Dunes, the original environment of the Antioch Dunes shield-back katydid, once bordered the Mojave Desert. It is said that in prehistorical times climate alterations separated the dunes from the Mojave, thus isolating species living on the dunes. For this reason, these species' survival was contingent on the uninterrupted ecology of the dunes. As the development of the Western United States began, the dune dwellers such as Neduba extincta declined in population and in this specific case were driven to extinction.Insect Extinctions and Insect Survival (by Michael J. Samways) Location The Antioch Dunes shield-back katydid was found in Antioch, California. It is described in the Antioch Sand Dunes, which formerly occupied a considerable acreage along the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers, but which are now restricted to a small, highly disturbed area under the threat of complete destruction.Piotr. \\"Extinct Shieldback (Neduba extincta). \\"Singing Insects of North America.

Extinction The extinction of the Antioch Dunes shield-back katydid was due to the industrialization of California. When Europeans started moving into California, Neduba extincta were driven to the Antioch Dunes where they resided until their extinction, recorded to have been in 1996. There were approximately eight different species of insects that were endemic to the Antioch Dunes, three of which are now extinct. The other five are on the list of endangered species.

Lawson, 461 U.S. 352 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning the constitutionality of vague laws that allow police to demand that \\"loiterers\\" and \\"wanderers\\" provide ‚Äúcredible and reliable‚Äù identification.  Background  Edward Lawson was a law-abiding black man with suitable knowledge of the U.S. Constitution. Lawson was frequently subjected to police questioning and harassment in San Diego County, California, where he lived when as a pedestrian he walked in so-called \\"white neighborhoods.\\" He was detained or arrested approximately 15 times by the San Diego Police within 18 months, was prosecuted twice, and was convicted once (the second charge was dismissed). Lawson challenged California Penal Code ¬ß 647(e), California Penal Code ¬ß 647(e) read, in relevant part, :\\"Every person who commits any of the following acts is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor: . . . (e) who loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business and who refuses to identify himself and to account for his presence when requested by any peace officer so to do, if the surrounding circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification.\\" California later removed this section because of this lawsuit, replacing it with what used to be ¬ß 647(f). which required persons who loiter or wander on the streets to identify themselves and account for their presence when requested by a peace officer to do so. A California appellate court, in People v. Solomon (1973), 33 Cal. App.3d 429, had construed the law to require \\"credible and reliable\\" identification that carries a \\"reasonable assurance\\" of its authenticity. In People v. Solomon (1973), the Court construed ¬ß 647(e) as requiring that a person detained under that statute‚Äôs authority produce \\"credible and reliable identification carrying reasonable assurance that the identification is authentic and providing means for later getting in touch with the person who has identified himself.\\" (33 Cal.App.3d 429, 439). The California Supreme Court denied review. Both the Ninth Circuit (658 F.2d 1362, 1364‚Äì1365, n. 3) and the U.S. Supreme Court (461 U.S. 352, 356, n. 4) used this construction in voiding ¬ß 647(e) for vagueness. William Kolender was an appellant who was acting in his capacity as Chief of Police of San Diego, as was John Duffy who was acting in his capacity as Sheriff of San Diego County.  Prior history  The Ninth Circuit, in Lawson v. Kolender, 658 F.2d 1362 (1981), had additionally held that Penal Code ¬ß647(e) violated the Fourth Amendment‚Äôs prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures because it \\"subverts the probable cause requirement\\" by authorizing arrest for conduct that is no more than suspicious. \\"Vagrancy statutes cannot turn otherwise innocent conduct into a crime.\\" Id. at 1367. The Ninth Circuit also noted that \\"police knowledge of the identity of an individual they have deemed ‚Äòsuspicious‚Äô grants the police unfettered discretion to initiate or continue the investigation of the person long after the detention has ended. Information concerning the stop, the arrest and the individual's identity may become part of a large scale data bank.\\" Id. at 1368. Lawson represented himself up through the conclusion of the Federal Ninth Circuit Court appeal. He was told he could not represent himself before the Supreme Court without a law degree, so he had an ACLU lawyer represent him before the Court.  Conclusion  Using the construction of the California appellate court in Solomon, the Court held that the law was unconstitutionally vague because it gave excessive discretion to the police (in the absence of probable cause to arrest) whether to stop and interrogate a suspect or leave him alone. Justice O‚ÄôConnor, writing for the Court, noted that the law :\\"... provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply with [the law]\\", conferring on police \\"virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation.\\" The Court hinted that the California statute compromised the constitutional right to freedom of movement. Because the U.S. Supreme Court was able to resolve Kolender on the issue of vagueness, they did not decide the Fourth Amendment issue. Subsequent history Kolender was cited in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, , as an example of a \\"stop and identify\\" statute the Court had voided on vagueness grounds. In Hiibel, the Court held that a Nevada law Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) ¬ß171.123(3) provides that: requiring persons detained upon reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime to state their name to a peace officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Unlike California Penal Code ¬ß647(e) as construed in Solomon, the Nevada statute was apparently interpreted by the Nevada Supreme Court as requiring only that persons detained upon involvement in a crime to state their name. See Hiibel v. Dist. Ct., 118 Nev. 868, at 875. Hiibel does not provide a means of arresting someone for failing or refusing to identify himself.Writing for the Court in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, Justice Kennedy stated, :Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise. The statute in Kolender had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer \\"credible and reliable\\" identification. In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted NRS ¬ß171.123(3) to require only that a suspect disclose his name. Justice Kennedy continued, :As we understand it, the statute does not require a suspect to give the officer a drivers license or any other document. Provided that the suspect either states his name or communicates it to the officer by other means‚Äîa choice, we assume, that the suspect may make‚Äîthe statute is satisfied and no violation occurs. Writing for the Nevada Supreme Court in Hiibel v. Dist. Ct., Chief Justice Young said, :The suspect is not required to provide private details about his background, but merely to state his name to an officer when reasonable suspicion exists. http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf [See People v. Fernandez, 2011 IL App (2d) 100473] California Penal Code ¬ß647(e) was repealed in 2008 at the request of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. California Penal Code ¬ß647(e) was repealed by Ch. 302, Stats. 2007 (SB 425, Margett), at the request of the Los Angeles County Sheriff‚Äôs Department.

Statement The theorem, proven by Tits, is stated as follows. :Let G be a finitely generated linear group over a field. Then two following possibilities occur: :*either G is virtually solvable (i.e. has a solvable subgroup of finite index) :*or it contains a nonabelian free group (i.e. it has a subgroup isomorphic to the free group on two generators). Consequences A linear group is not amenable if and only if it contains a non-abelian free group (thus the von Neumann conjecture, while not true in general, holds for linear groups). The Tits alternative is an important ingredient in the proof of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth. In fact the alternative essentially establishes the result for linear groups (it reduces it to the case of solvable groups, which can be dealt with by elementary means). Generalizations In geometric group theory, a group G is said to satisfy the Tits alternative if for every subgroup H of G either H is virtually solvable or H contains a nonabelian free subgroup (in some versions of the definition this condition is only required to be satisfied for all finitely generated subgroups of G). Examples of groups satisfying the Tits alternative which are either not linear, or at least not known to be linear, are: *Hyperbolic groups *Mapping class groups; *Out(Fn); *Certain groups of birational transformations of algebraic surfaces. Examples of groups not satisfying the Tits alternative are: *the Grigorchuk group; *Thompson's group F. Proof The proof of the original Tits alternative is by looking at the Zariski closure of G in \\\\mathrm{GL}_n(k). If it is solvable then the group is solvable. Otherwise one looks at the image of G in the Levi component. If it is noncompact then a ping-pong argument finishes the proof. If it is compact then either all eigenvalues of elements in the image of G are roots of unity and then the image is finite, or one can find an embedding of k in which one can apply the ping-pong strategy. Note that the proof of all generalisations above also rests on a ping-pong argument.

The group was formed in 1990 when Vengeance Rising members Larry Farkas, Doug Thieme, Glen Mancaruso, and Roger Dale Martin split the band, citing unrest with that band's front man and vocalist, Roger Martinez. They hired Robyn Kyle Basauri, formerly of Jaguar, as a vocalist and he officially joined the band after the release of their eponymous debut. At the time of their first album the band was seen as \\"Vengeance Rising with a new Vocalist\\". For their second release, however, their sound changed to more of a hard, classic rock sound. Lyrically, the band was socially focused. Songs dealt with issues such as Magic Johnson and HIV- AIDS (\\"Real\\") and American Indian massacres (\\"Painted Truth\\"). Related Projects Following the demise of Die Happy, Robyn Kyle Basauri and bassist Greg Chaisson formed the band Red Sea. Hiring Chris Howell on guitar and Jeff Martin on drums, the band released one album, Blood, on Rugged Records in 1994. They were initially scheduled for a support tour with Ken Tamplin, but were dropped in favor of Greg X. Volz. Musically, they were compared to the English band Deep Purple. Larry Farkas, Glen Mancaruso, Roger Dale Martin, and Doug Thieme had reformed under the new name Once Dead with the addition of Ultimatum vocalist Scott Waters. Originally planning to be a reunion, Martinez owned the original rights to the name. Instead of fighting for the rights to \\"Vengeance Rising,\\" they instead used the name \\"Once Dead\\". Once Dead has released one album so far, Visions of Hell. The line up for this release included Jim Chaffin (The Crucified, The Blamed, Facedown, Deliverance) on drums and Devin Schaeffer (Fasedown) on vocals. A follow up album has been delayed due to a vocal condition of Schaeffer's.

The son of former Liverpool player Geoff Twentyman, Geoff Jr. began his career as a trainee at his father's club, but after failing to make the grade there he played for Formby before being sold on to Chorley for around ¬£1,000 and from there to Preston North End. After making 98 league appearances for Preston, scoring four goals, he was released by the Lancashire club, and was signed by Bristol Rovers. He was taken to Rovers by Bobby Gould, and was later managed by Gerry Francis, playing a total of 252 league games, scoring six goals, and made a Wembley appearance in the final of the Associate Members' Cup in 1990. Twentyman began coaching youth football with Brimsham Green F.C. in Yate shortly after moving to Bristol, and is now the club's honorary president. When Francis left Rovers in 1991, Twentyman applied for the vacant manager's job, but was not appointed. After the end of his playing career he studied at Bristol Polytechnic and then joined Radio Bristol as a sports journalist. In 1993, he became the sports editor of Radio Bristol. When Ian Holloway became the manager of Bristol Rovers in 1996, Twentyman joined him as assistant manager. The job wasn't to his liking and he returned to his previous job in 1997. On 22 June 2008 he played for Bristol Rovers in the inaugural Western Masters, where the team finished third of the four teams competing.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Structure Sonnet 118 is a typical English or Shakespearean sonnet. It consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet, with the characteristic rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 13th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / But thence I learn, and find the lesson true, (118.13) Lines 5, 6, 7, and 8 each have a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding; (118.6) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Line 4 features the rightward movement of the second ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / √ó / We sicken to shun sickness when we purge; (118.4) The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: line 5's \\"even\\" and \\"being\\" each function as one syllable. Line 9 requires an unusual (to modern ears) contraction, \\"t'anticipate\\". Sonnet 118's first two quatrains feature typical Shakespearean parallel construction with each pair of lines introduced with \\"Like as to\\", \\"As to\\", \\"Even so\\", and \\"And\\". Reminiscent of the Petrarchan sonnet, there is a volta, or shift, in the poem's subject matter beginning with the third quatrain. Analysis Traditionally the administering of emetics, the trope worked in Sonnet 118, had three purposes: to renew the palate, to forestall the onset of sickness, and to counteract poison. The sonnet also picks up the motif of \\"palate\\", \\"cup\\", and \\"poison\\", left off at the end of Sonnet 114. The first pair of lines describes how \\"we our pallat urge\\"; \\"urge\\" means to 'intensify' or 'sharpen' the taste, but the word was used also of distillations which are 'urged' to a degree that a compound is yielded. \\"Appetites\\" are sharpened or made more acute (\\"more keen\\") with \\"eager compounds\\". A 'compound' is a medicinal concoction, in this case one that is sharp or \\"biting\\" like 'vin-egar', a wine that is made 'eager' or sharp. The second pair of lines explores emetics that are taken (\\"we purge\\") to \\"prevent\\" illnesses yet to come (\\"maladies unseen\\"). Emetics make us sick through vomit (\\"sicken\\"), so that we might avoid ailments (\\"shun sickness\\"). The second quatrain applies the principles of the first: \\"being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, / To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;\\" \\"ne'er\\" firstly means never, as in the poet is never sated by the youth's sweetness. But \\"nere\\" meaning 'near' or 'almost' can't be ignored: the poet's palate is \\"full\\" of the friend's sweetness, that is nearly rich enough to cause gagging (\\"cloying\\"). To refresh his palate the poet has designed his diet to include \\"bitter sauces\\". Bitter digestifs typically contain carminative herbs, which are thought to aid digestion. As a consequence, the poet has found himself inoculated against future ailments. He has been made \\"sick of welfare\\" but finds it appropriate (\\"a kind of meetness\\", with echoes of 'meat') that he has become ill (\\"To be diseased\\"), before there was any cause to be so (\\"ere that there was true needing\\"). The sestet applies the emetical trope to love: a \\"policy\\" is a course of prudent action. Love, to be prudent and to forestall future ailings (\\"to anticipate / The ills that were, not\\"), acquainted itself early with transgressions (\\"grew to faults assured\\") that operate like a curative vomit. In so doing, love submitted to medicine (\\"brought to medicine\\") \\"a healthful state\\", a state reeking of goodness (\\"rank of goodness\\"). The \\"healthful state\\", with its goodness, \\"would by ill be cured\\", would as if by an initial, induced sickness be cured. The moral the poet has learnt and has proved by bitter experience is that potions (\\"Drugs\\", in this case transgressions), rather than acting as an antidote to the disease of love, only act to poison love.

Mushezib-Marduk the Chaldean prince chosen as King of Babylon led the Babylonian populace in revolt against Assyria and King Sennacherib.  Rebellion forces  Achaemenes recruited a new army to help the Babylonians against the Assyrians, under the leadership of Mushezib-Marduk. As well as the Babylonians, the Aramaic tribes, the Chaldeans and King Khumban-umena III of the Elamites, and all the Zagros Iranians (Persia, Anzan, Ellipi, etc.) joined in rebellion against the Assyrians. The nucleus of the army consisted of Elamite, Median and Persian charioteers, infantry, and cavalrymen.  Result  Sennacherib during his Babylonian war The battle was indecisive, or at least both sides claimed the victory in their annals and all rulers remained on their thrones.The Encyclopedia of World History Mushezib-Marduk lost his ally when the Elamite king Humban-nimena suffered a stroke later that same year, an opportunity King Sennacherib quickly seized by attacking Babylon, and eventually capturing it after a nine-month siege. Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib. The Persians and Medes were then subjugated. There was further fighting between Elam and Assyria over the next 40 years until Elam was destroyed by Ashurbanipal.

Hesselyn's first 12 victories were claimed during the defence of Malta in 1942. He later collaborated in the writing of Spitfires over Malta, a book about his experiences on the island, before he was shot down and taken a prisoner of war in October 1943. Liberated in 1945, he transferred to the Royal Air Force in 1947 and attained the rank of squadron leader before his death in 1963, aged 42. Early life Hesselyn was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 13 March 1921. In civilian life, he was a machinist. Second World War Hesselyn joined the New Zealand Territorial Force in 1939, transferring to the Royal New Zealand Air Force the following year. After training, he was posted to Britain in September 1941, joining first No. 61 Operational Training Unit (OTU), then No. 234 Squadron RAF as a flight sergeant. In February 1942, Hesselyn was posted to Malta, flying a Spitfire Mk V from the deck of the aircraft carrier , to the island and joining No. 249 Squadron RAF on 9 March 1942. On April Fools' Day 1942, Hesselyn recorded his first two kills, a Bf 109 of JG 53 and a Ju 87 of StG 3. Later that month, he shot down another Bf 109 and Ju 87, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The citation for the award, promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 22 May 1942, read: May proved to be just as productive, with Hesselyn claiming four 109s and a Ju 88 of KGruppe 806 over a four-day period. For this he received a Bar to his DFM, and was commissioned as a pilot officer. Before returning to England, he downed one more 109, for a total of 12 claimed victories. During a spell at No. 61 OTU, Hesselyn and fellow No. 249 Squadron pilot, Flight Lieutenant Virgil \\"Paul\\" Brennan, collaborated with journalist Henry Bateson on writing Spitfires over Malta, an award-winning book based on Brennan and Hesselyn's experiences on Malta. In early 1943 Hesselyn joined No. 501 Squadron RAF, before going on to No. 222 Squadron RAF as a flight commander later in the year. He shot down two 109s of JG 3 on 17 August 1943, and received the Distinguished Flying Cross in October for his \\"great skill, courage and keenness\\" in downing 17 aircraft. His luck finally ran out on 3 October 1943.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 328 dunams of land from the Palestinian town of 'Anata in order to construct Alon.'Anata Town Profile Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem. 21 July 2004. Named after Yigal Allon, it was founded in 1990 by a number of area residents under the aegis of the Amana settlement organisation, it was originally considered to be part of the nearby Kfar Adumim so as to minimise opposition in an atmosphere in which the question of settlement was becoming increasingly controversial. Children study in a mixed secular/observant public-religious school in nearby Kfar Adumim, and attend highschool in Jerusalem. Alon was one of a number of settlements linked by a road secretly built by settlers in 1995. The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number of secretly built roads under construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if told by the Israel Defense Forces. He also said \\"What are they going to do, tell us to take the road away?

Thorndike served in World War I and was a 1919 graduate of Harvard College and a 1921 graduate of Harvard Medical School. He pioneered many advancements in sports medicine, including the rules that a physician must be present at every sports event and that a doctor must decide if an injured athlete should play. He also designed advanced equipment for football players and was the first to insist that hockey players wear helmets. Thorndike began working at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1921 as a general surgeon before also offering his medical services to the Harvard University Athletic Department in 1926. It was based upon his experiences working with athletes during this period that he determined there to be a specific need to improve medical care for athletes and later that specialization in the field was necessary. In 1938, Thorndike wrote America's first book on athletic injuries.Harvard Medical embraces NBA sports science He wrote two books, \\"Athletic Injuries\\" and \\"Manual of Bandaging, Strapping and Splinting\\".Dr. Augustus Thorndike, Specialist in Sports Medicine, Dead at 89 One of the principal reasons for which Dr. Thorndike is regarded as a \\"pioneer\\" in the industry was his insistence that only a physician was qualified to determine whether an athlete was healthy enough to compete or play their sport and that this decision should not be left to coaches. He was the first to insist that hockey players wear helmets, introduced the idea of taping, and to design improved protective gear for football players. Serving twenty-two months in the Pacific during World War II, he was chief of surgical services and commanding officer of the Harvard Unit, 105th General Hospital, the largest army hospital overseas. In 1945, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on behalf of veterans. Thorndike also directed a program for the rehabilitation of the wounded after the war.

The cathedral was replaced by a new Cathedral of the Holy Cross located in the South End. History of the Catholic presence in Boston Prior to the erection of Holy Cross, Boston‚Äôs several hundred mostly French and Irish Roman Catholics met in a small, dilapidated former Huguenot meetinghouse made of brick and located on the south side of School Street, a few doors up from Washington Street.O‚ÄôConnor, Thomas H. Bibles, Brahmins, and Bosses, p. 144. Boston: Trustees of the Boston Public Library of the City of Boston, 1991. As this arrangement proved inadequate and the lease on the chapel was about to expire, in March 1799 a committee was appointed and charged with raising funds for the purchase of a building site and the procurement of plans for a proper church. A site was chosen at the southern end of the Tontine Crescent at what is today 214 Devonshire Street. Acquisition and Building The property belonged to the Boston Theatre proprietors and Bulfinch, who was a member of the corporation, obtained the land at what Father Fran√ßois Matignon termed \\"the moderate price of 2500 Dols.\\"Lord, Robert, Sexton, John E., and Harrington, Edward T., History of the Archdiocese of Boston, vol. I, p. 556. New York, 1944. Bulfinch then submitted plans for the church to his friend Father John Cheverus without fee. Ground was broken on March 17, 1800, and the building dedicated on September 29, 1803. The minutes of the building committee report \\"the thanks of the whole Society were voted and desired to be offered to Mr. James Bulfinch, Esq., for his kindness to the Congregation in having supplied us with a very elegant plan for our new Church, and such as united decency and ornament with economy and having shown himself a friend and Patron to us.\\"Lord, Sexton, Harrington, p. 556. In recognition for his charity, the Catholic faithful presented him with a fine silver tea-urn, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.Whitehill, Walter Muir and Kennedy, Lawrence W. Boston: A Topographical History, p. 68. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 2000. Bulfinch also pleased Boston‚Äôs Catholics by assisting in the subscription taken to provide a building fund and his personal supervision of each stage of construction. About $17,000 was collected, more than one- fifth donated by Boston Protestants, who generally seemed in agreement with Shubael Bell, senior warden of Christ Church, that \\"no circumstance has contributed more to the peace and good order of the town, than the establishment of a Catholic church.\\"Bell, Shubael. An Account of the Town of Boston Written in 1817, Bostonian Society Publications, vol. III (1919), p. 39. President John Adams headed the list of non-Catholic donors, which included such Bulfinch patrons as Joseph Coolidge, Jonathan Mason, Stephen Higginson, Harrison Gray Otis, and Elias Hasket Derby of Salem. Bulfinch‚Äôs concern for the interior decorations sparked the interest of the painter Henry Sargent, who designed an altarpiece representing the Crucifixion. Architectural Significance Holy Cross was the second church Bulfinch designed in Boston. It represented certain visual advances over his Hollis Street Church (dem.) in its more proportionally balanced facade. Its specifications, as given in the architect‚Äôs handwriting, called for a building approximately 75‚Äô x 58‚Äô with a 30‚Äô height; the square-headed windows in the ground story measured 4‚Äô x 7‚Äô and those above 4‚Äô x 9‚Äô. The choir was placed in the gallery directly over the entrance on Franklin Street. Contemporary sources describe the church as being in the \\"Italian Renaissance\\" style, a designation prompted by placement of the cupola on a line with the front elevation and the use of a pair of Baroque consoles to conceal the pitch of the roof.Columbian Centinel, October 1, 1803.Shaw, Charles. A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston (Boston, 1817), p. 256.Bostonian Society Publications, II (1905), pp. 31ff. It is uncertain whether the design of Holy Cross derived from London examples such as St Martin, Ludgate, or came directly from the architect‚Äôs memory of Roman churches he had seen, and possibly sketched, in 1786: Santo Spirito in Sassia and Santa Maria Vallicella. Such use of Renaissance forms was less common in New England at the time. It was employed by Bulfinch with a na√Øve charm that he repeated only once, on New North Church, designed a year after Holy Cross was consecrated. Elevation to Cathedral Status and Replacement A side-by-side comparison of the new Holy Cross Cathedral in the South End (left) and the old Holy Cross on Franklin Street (right). In 1808, when Pope Pius VII created the Diocese of Boston and Cheverus became its first bishop, the church became a cathedral. Enlarged in 1825, the building nonetheless proved too small for the city‚Äôs fast-growing Catholic population. Furthermore, the area had become commercial and the dilapidated cathedral was surrounded by business blocks. The last Mass, at which Bishop Fitzpatrick was reportedly too overcome with sadness to speak, was celebrated there on September 16, 1860Patrick E.

In 1950, an engraved tablet was placed adjacent to the St. Thomas More Oratory entrance at 49 Franklin Street. It reads: \\"Near this site stood THE CATHEDRAL OF THE HOLY CROSS, established 1803 by Jean Lefebvre de Cheverus, First Catholic Bishop of Boston; Missionary to the Penobscot Indians; Friend of President John Adams; Advisor to our State Legislature; One of America‚Äôs noblest priests. He stood by the bedside of Catholic and Protestant alike. This tablet placed by a group of Protestant Businessmen, 1950.\\"O‚ÄôConnor. NotesReferences *Kirker, Harold.

Background and education Lowther was the elder son of Anthony Lowther, Viscount Lowther, and Muriel Frances Farrar, daughter of Sir George Herbert Farrar, a South African Randlord. Lowther was educated at Eton, he then attended Cambridge University in October 1940 to read Mechanical Engineering but abandoned his course after three months and joined the Army in 1941.Eton, Oxbridge, the military and industry equipped the Earl to transform his estate, 2 June 2006 Cumberland News. Public life The Army sent Lowther to Oxford University, where he completed a degree in Electricity and Magnetism in just six months, and he was commissioned into the Royal Armoured Corps in September 1942. As a Regimental Technical Adjutant with the rank of Captain in the East Riding Yeomanry, he was responsible for the upkeep of fifty-two tanks, two hundred soft vehicles and fifty soldiers, and helped put the first tanks ashore on the Normandy beaches on D-Day. He was later wounded at Caen following the landings, but subsequently returned to the front. After being demobilised in 1946 he managed a steel erection and sheeting company in Newcastle until his father died somewhat prematurely in 1949. He accepted the invitation of his grandfather, Lancelot Lowther, 6th Earl of Lonsdale, to take over the running of the family estates which he subsequently inherited four years later after his grandfather's death in 1953. By this time the Lowther Estates, which comprised some in Westmorland and Cumberland, were largely run down and burdened by debt, and the Inland Revenue was demanding the payment of death duties amounting to some ¬£2 million. Much of the estate's property in Whitehaven, a town largely built by earlier generations of Lowthers, was disposed of as part of his rescue plan, as indeed was the sale of acres of timber on the estates, felled to raise ready cash, although in this case the Earl replanted half as many trees again. He also established a string of new businesses, Lowther Construction, Lowther Forestry Group, Lowther Park Farms and the Lowther Wildlife Park which helped restore the family's fortunes, but was however unable to find any alternative use for the ancestral pile at Lowther Castle, and he reluctantly decided in 1957 to remove the roof, buttress the walls and leave it as a romantic ruin. He also established the annual Lowther Horse Driving Trials and Country Fair which has attracted thousands of visitors to Cumbria each year, including amongst their number Prince Philip, a regular competitor at the former and the royal couple often stayed with Lonsdale and his family at Lowther in Askham Hall during the trials.A champion of the countryside whose Lowther legacy lives on, 26 May 2006 Cumberland News Thereafter regarded as the saviour of his family estates, he resisted inclusion in the Sunday Times Rich List on the grounds that he was virtually penniless. However, after many years prevarication, he was eventually forced to admit his wealth and appeared in the 2006 Rich list with an estimated net worth of ¬£80 million and later admitted that he anticipated that his death would result in the payment of \\"somewhere between ¬£3 million and ¬£5 million to the Treasury because it's high time society had its chunk\\". He briefly came to public prominence in 1962 when Manchester Corporation proposed turning Ullswater into a reservoir to serve the people of Manchester. Having made a speech against the proposal in the House of Lords, the Earl became a leading figure in the Ullswater Preservation Society which campaigned against the scheme and eventually forced the Corporation to adopt a drastically revised scheme. He thereafter became passionately concerned with the issue of the conservation of the Lake District and an opponent of the modern notion of building wind turbines. When one of his sons struck a deal to place wind turbines on part of the estates that he controlled, the Earl opposed the construction at the subsequent public inquiry. Lonsdale was a founder director of Border Television, and was chairman of that company from 1985 to 1990. He also served as a chairman of the Northern Sports Council and a member of the UK Sports Council, spent six years on the Northern Economic Planning Council and was a member of the English Tourist Board. In addition he was president of Grasmere Sports, the Patterdale Dog Day, and the Cumberland and Westmorland Playing Fields Association, and served on a number of bodies such as the Hill Farming Advisory Committee, Westmorland Agricultural Committee, Northern Arts and the Rosehill Theatre at Whitehaven. He eventually retired as head of the Lowther estate in 1993, having reached the age of seventy, and handed the business over to his second son. In later life he developed an interest in horse racing and was a part-owner of Motivator, the 2005 Derby winner.

Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management (known as simply Hilton College) is one of 13 academic colleges at the University of Houston. The college offers two degree programs: a Bachelor of Science in Hotel & Restaurant Management and a Master of Science in Hospitality Management. History Hilton College was founded in 1969, when James C. Taylor, who would become the first dean, presented Eric and Barron Hilton‚Äîsons of Conrad Hilton‚Äîwith plans to build a hospitality school at the University of Houston. When they presented the plans to their father, Conrad Hilton contributed $1.5 million for the completion of the project. Classes began at Hilton College on Sept. 16, 1969, with 39 students and three professors. Taylor was named the first dean. The first class‚Äîconsisting of eight students, most of whom began their hospitality studies elsewhere at UH‚Äîgraduated from Hilton College in 1971. In 1975, a new Hilton College facility opened, which included the Hilton University of Houston Hotel and Conference Center. In 1983, the Hilton Foundation gave the college a $21.3-million grant to expand its facilities and increase endowment and operation support. That gift led to the construction of the South Wing, which opened in 1989 and added 94,000 square feet of education and meeting space to Hilton College. In 2010, the Hilton University of Houston completed a $12.5-million renovation to upgrade its facilities and create an enhanced experiential-learning environment for the students of Hilton College. It was the first major renovation to the hotel since it opened in 1975. Hilton College houses four hospitality-related research institutes, the Hospitality Hall of Honor, the Massad Family Library Research Center and the Hospitality Industry Archives. Barron's Restaurant Barron's Restaurant, named for Barron Hilton, is the student-run restaurant at Hilton College. It was created as part of the College's focus on experiential learning. It is open for lunch, Monday-Friday, during the fall and spring semesters and is staffed entirely by students, from the managers, to the cooks, to the servers. Barron's serves as a lab for two Hilton College courses: Food & Beverage Service and Advanced Food & Beverage Management. Students in the Barron's courses are expected to learn foodservice and hospitality industry standards in the lecture portion of their studies, and then apply those teachings in their weekly lab shifts. In the fall of 2012, Barron's debuted a new, Bistro-inspired menu. Hilton College students work in the kitchen of Barron's Restaurant. Cougar Grounds In January 2009, the College opened the Cougar Grounds coffee shop, the first university coffee house in the U.S. to be run by students as part of a corollary education class. Cougar Grounds serves as the laboratory for an entrepreneurship class, in which students learn about small-business operations, including marketing and sales, price-setting, payroll, cost control, supply management and new product development. Hilton University of Houston The Hilton University of Houston, a full-service Hilton hotel located in the Wheeler District of the university campus, and serves as the primary teaching facility for the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. It was first built in 1975 and underwent a $12.5 million renovation in 2010. The hotel has 86 guest rooms and 25,000 square feet of banquet space. Student interns rotate through many of the positions at the hotel, including jobs in guest services, hotel operations and banquet services. The UH campus and downtown Houston are seen from a room at the Hilton University of Houston Hotel & Conference Center. Hospitality Hall of Honor Hilton College houses the Hospitality Hall of Honor, which was established in 1995 to recognize leaders in the hospitality industry. Each year since 1996, a small group of honorees has been inducted into the Hall. The induction ceremony includes a formal reception and dinner, which are held at the Hilton University of Houston and planned by a team of student leaders. The week of the ceremony, Hilton College hosts a series of industry-related Think Tanks for students. Student organizations Students get the chance to network with hospitality-industry recruiters twice a year at Hilton College's spring and fall career fairs. There are 16 student organizations at Hilton College, each of which has its own faculty mentor. The organizations, which cater to different sectors and aspects of the hospitality industry, all participate in community-service projects and networking events.

Biography Born in Willst√§tt, he immigrated to England in 1773 and later to the colony of New York where he became a merchant. Being a Loyalist, he left America after the American War of Independence and returned to England. In 1785, he returned to North America and settled in Quebec City. Through endeavours that started with his first grocery store and extended to real estate operations, with money lending and discounting in between, Pozer succeeded in building a fortune over 30 years. Among his many real estate possessions was the Aubert-Gallion Seigneurie that he bought in 1807. Ten years later, he settled in Aubert-Gallion 189 German immigrants. Most of these immigrants died after a forest clearing spread into a wildfire. After this unsuccessful attempt to established German compatriots in Aubert-Gallion, Pozer, despite being a Protestant and a Loyalist, began collaborating with the Catholic Church and the francophone population.

Looney Tunes animated short film directed by Chuck Jones. The cartoon was released on February 13, 1954 and stars Claude Cat, Marc Antony and Pussyfoot. It features Claude Cat and Marc Antony in a battle of brawn and brains, with the little black-and-white kitten Pussyfoot caught in the middle. This is the third cartoon with Marc Antony and Pussyfoot (Feed the Kitty and Kiss Me Cat being the previous shorts). Synopsis Pussyfoot is napping on a plush pillow when Claude kicks her off to claim the pillow for himself. Marc Antony attacks Claude in retaliation, throwing him off and returning Pussyfoot to the pillow, and then begins to clobber Claude. Marc Antony is almost immediately caned on the head by Filbert, the animals' stodgy master; having only seen Marc Antony pummeling Claude, Filbert gives Marc Antony a final warning to leave the cats alone. After this, the conniving Claude schemes to convince Filbert that Marc Antony wants to harm the cats; while Marc Antony is sleeping, he places Pussyfoot in his mouth and yowls to Filbert to make him think Marc Antony is trying to eat Pussyfoot. Claude's scheme is successful, Filbert is tricked, and Marc Antony is thrown out of the house. Claude indulges in his new life without Marc Antony, taunting the dog by openly abusing Pussyfoot in front of him, dropping Pussyfoot in a vase, and mocking Marc Antony. Though he remains exiled outside, Marc Antony manages to find ways to beat up Claude, either from behind closed doors and/or by getting into the house in crafty manners. While most of his machinations are short-lived and he is rapidly and violently ejected from the house by Filbert, it usually gives him enough time to clobber Claude again before he gets booted out. The multiple thumpings Claude endures over the course of the night eventually elicit the cat's surrender, when he realizes Marc Antony will keep attacking him until he tells the truth. Marc Antony forces Claude to confess to his crimes and is let back into the house and back to the side of his beloved Pussyfoot. A dazed Claude gives Filbert his signed confession, then retrieves Pussyfoot from the vase and places her back in her bed as Marc Antony watches carefully, ready to pummel Claude again if he tries anything to frame him or hurt Pussyfoot once more. Filbert consequently kicks Claude out of the house as punishment for framing Marc Antony and tricking him, landing him in the street, and is promptly run over by a streetcar. Claude sits upright and bemoans \\"Just one of those days, I guess.\\" before passing out.

The 3,700-metre approach canal is deep and capable of accommodating ships with a capacity of 150,000 tonnes and more. In May 2008, Putin confirmedKommersant.com.

Biography Lisunov was born in stanitsa Durnovskaya (now Rassvet), Yenotaevsky uyezd of the Governorate of Astrakhan, Russian Empire. His father was a cossiack officer. In 1918 he graduated from the Saratov secondary school #2 and went to Moscow to study at the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy, where he made friends with another prominent Russian aircraft designer Sergey Ilyushin. From 1926, he served as an engineer-mechanic to an aviation squadron in the Soviet Airforce, rising to the position of chief engineer at Aircraft Factory No. 39 in Kharkov.–ì–æ—Ä–±—É–Ω–æ–≤ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á. –®—Ç—Ä–∏—Ö–∏ –∫ –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –∞–≤–∏–∞–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –ë.–ü.–õ–∏—Å—É–Ω–æ–≤–∞. –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–∞–∑–∞—á—å–µ–≥–æ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ (8 –º–∞—è 1997). In November 1936, Lisunov travelled to the Douglas Aircraft works in Santa Monica, California, to start the process of licensed production of the Douglas DC-3 in Soviet Union. From November 1936 to April 1939, Lisunov documented every part of the DC-3 and its production tooling. He also documented post-delivery in-service support. Together with his boss, Vladimir Myasishchev, Lisunov started the process of re-engineering the DC-3 with the objective of putting the model into production. Most of the work involved conversion of the drawings and documents into the metric system.–õ.–õ.–°–µ–ª—è–∫–æ–≤. –¢–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—ã–π –ø—É—Ç—å –≤ –Ω–∏–∫—É–¥–∞. –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –∞–≤–∏–∞–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞. - –ú.: 4 - —Ñ–∏–ª–∏–∞–ª –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–∞, –ú. 1997 –≥. - 256 —Å., –∏–ª., –≥—Ä.

After Myasishchev was arrested, Lisunov was appointed to head the further development of the DC-3 derivative named Lisunov Li-2. Military and civil versions of Li-2 were produced by a few Soviet aircraft plants from 1939 to 1952 making it most numerous Soviet airliner in the 1940-ties. In September 1941 as the Nazis were approaching Moscow Lisunov managed to swiftly evacuate the aircraft plant to the safe location that was chosen to be Tashkent, capital of Uzbek SSR. Soon the newly- established aircraft plant, later known as Tashkent Aviation Production Association, started to contribute to the Soviet war effort with the domestically-made Li-2's.–ì–∞–∑–∏–µ–≤, –†–∞–¥–∏–∫. –ê–≤–∏–∞–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ë. –ü. –õ–∏—Å—É–Ω–æ–≤. –ö 120-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é —Å–æ –¥–Ω—è –µ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è (10.12.2018)–¢–æ—Ä–æ–ø–∏—Ü—ã–Ω –í.–õ. –õ–∏—Å—É–Ω–æ–≤ –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤–∏—á (1898-1946), –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–∞–∑–∞–∫, –∞–≤–∏–∞–∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä-–ø–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫, –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä —Å–µ—Ä–∏–π–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∞ –õ–ò-2 // V-e –ë–∏—Ä—é–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ —á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è: –ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –ë–∏—Ä—é–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö —á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–π (13 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2013 –≥–æ–¥–∞). ‚Äî –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω—å: –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏–µ –ê—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ ¬´–ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ-–ø–æ–ª–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å ¬´–í–æ–ª–≥–∞¬ª, 2013. - —Å.. ‚Äî 2013. ‚Äî Lisunov died in 1946 after having suffered a heart attack.

History The People's Park Complex was a commercial housing project undertaken by the newly formed Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board's Sale of Sites programme. The project was the subject of the programme's first sale in 1967. Located at the foot of Pearl's Hill, the site where the People's Park Complex currently stands was an open public park. It later became the People's Market or Pearl's Market with outdoor stalls which was destroyed by a fire in 1966. With a height of 103 metres (338 feet), the 31-storey People's Park Complex building was the first shopping centre of its kind in Southeast Asia and set the pattern for later retail developments in Singapore. The shopping centre was completed in October 1970, while the residential block was completed in 1973. Occupying 1 hectare in the heart of Chinatown, the People's Park Complex was the largest shopping complexes in the shopping commercial belt along Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road. 2010 fire On 21 April 2010, a storeroom on the fifth floor caught fire, resulting in a huge blaze and with hunted corners and triggering a massive evacuation. No-one was hurt in the incident, but substantial damage was reported by tenants caused by soot and water leakage. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) subsequently found that the presence of such storerooms on that floor were not authorized; in breach of fire safety regulations. Residential Lift Breakdowns The three lifts found in the residential block of People's Park Complex have been subject to media attention, due to their unreliability and frequent breakdowns. According to residents, the lifts \\"malfunction three to five times a month\\", thus forcing residents to take the stairs. Architecture In 1967, following the break-up of Malayan Architects Co-Partnership, William Lim set up Design Partnership (now known as DP Architects) with Tay Kheng Soon and Koh Seow Chuan. In its first year, the firm was successful with its architectural proposal for People's Park Complex.Robert Powell (2004), Singapore Architecture, Periplus Editions, The People's Park Complex is a large mixed- use development, consisting of offices and apartments above a podium of shopping space. The complex was envisioned as \\"a new nucleus within the whole fabric of the city core\\", and was designed to revitalise one of the most populated and traditional enclaves in post-independent Singapore. Being a \\"people's shopping centre\\", the complex is strategically located in one of the most populous areas in Singapore's central business district. The architecture of the complex scored several firsts in Singapore. Its name as well as the block of flats was the closest to Le Corbusier's ideal of high-rise living, as expressed in his Marseilles Unit√© d'Habitation, both in concept and in form.Jane Beamish, Jane Ferguson (1989), A History of Singapore Architecture: The Making of a City, Graham Brash, The building's main tower accommodates a variety of apartment sizes, and access to them is independent of the shopping centre at the podium. Its 25 levels have been nicknamed \\"streets in the air\\", a development of the Corbusian ideal, and offer convenient spots for social interaction and intermingling. Design Partnership added verticals to the building's roof, enhancing the visual impact of the residential block. The roof-level common area contains shared amenities, like a cr√®che and open-air play space, built for communal use. The shopping centre incorporates the first \\"city room\\" or atrium in Singapore, a concept that was pioneered by several Japanese architects under the Metabolist Movement in the 1960s. When Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki visited the site during construction, he exclaimed \\"But we theorised and you people are getting it built!\\". The shops in the shopping mall surrounds the large internal \\"city room\\", which consists of two multi-storey interlocking atriums, where a large number of \\"turn-over shops\\" and kiosks are located. The \\"city room\\" serves to retain the busy character of Chinatown. The original exterior finish of the People's Park Complex was exposed raw concrete, in keeping with the Brutalist architectural style. This was also manifested in the design of the tower and podium, and the circular portholes topping off the residential building. Today, the building's fa√ßade has been painted over with shades of green and maroon.  Activity  People's Park Complex also houses trades which are excluded from the dominant narrative of Chinatown. The sidewalk located outside People's Park Complex is famous for the elderly cobblers who set up makeshift workspaces to repair shoes, a tradition present since the 1950s.

It was utilized as a ruse when forced to surrender a side arm to an unfriendly party. The maneuver Normal Old West procedure for surrender of a loaded pistol called for it to be handed over backwards (butt-first). A well-trained gunslinger could, upon demand for surrender, surreptitiously insert their forefinger through the trigger guard of the reversed pistol while extending it toward the party being surrendered to. When the other party reached for the pistol with their (presumably dominant) hand, a sharp, practiced motion of the wrist would pivot the gun around the forefinger, flipping it back into firing position for an immediate shot. This maneuver could also be done with the pistol upside down as well as backwards. It is worth noting that the maneuver relied upon a suitably inexperienced or overly-confident mark; an unwise captor might well underestimate their target's lethality and fail to carefully dictate the manner in which the surrendering party turned over their live weapon(s). A more experienced lawman or gunfighter could (and did) easily negate any trickery by a number of methods, including forcing the surrendering party to throw their gun(s) to the side or to return them to their holster, then drop their entire gun belt and step backwards several feet. Famous incidents *In his autobiography, John Wesley Hardin claims to have demonstrated this technique to Wild Bill Hickok. *Clint Eastwood recreated the border roll in a scene in The Outlaw Josey Wales where two buffalo hunters momentarily get the drop on him in an Indian agent's outpost.

The film was adapted by Nunnally Johnson from the novel Useless Cowboy by Alan Le May. It was the only feature film produced by Cooper during his long film career. Much of the film was shot at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California. Cooper had previously worked at the movie ranch in The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935) and other productions. Cooper had a Western town built at the movie ranch for Along Came Jones; this Western set was subsequently used in many other productions over the next 20 years and became a fixture in B-Westerns in particular. Premise Easygoing Melody Jones (Gary Cooper) and his friend George Fury (William Demarest) wander into a town. Jones is mistaken for a wanted bandit named Monte Jarrad (Dan Duryea), which causes him no end of trouble. Meanwhile, the real Jarrad is hiding out in the home of his girl, Cherry de Longpre (Loretta Young). At first, she tries to use the newcomer to distract the townsfolk, but as she gets to know Jones, her feelings start to change. The film spoofs many Western film cliches as well as the Western persona that Cooper played in previous films, such as the lead character being unable to shoot straight and partial to singing \\"silly songs\\" while riding his horse. Cast * Gary Cooper as Melody Jones * Loretta Young as Cherry de Longpre * William Demarest as George Fury * Dan Duryea as Monte Jarrad * Frank Sully as Avery de Longpre * Don Costello as Leo Gledhill * Walter Sande as Ira Waggoner * Russell Simpson as Pop de Longpre * Arthur Loft as Sheriff * Willard Robertson as Luke Packard * Ray Teal as Kriendler * Lane Chandler as Boone * Erville Alderson as Bartender (uncredited) * Hank Bell as Posse Rider (uncredited) Production Along Came Jones was produced under the working title American Cowboy. It was Cooper's first Western since The Westerner in 1940. It was also Cooper's first film as an independent producer under his International Pictures, Inc., with Cinema Artists Corp. co-producing, and the only film in which he both acted and produced. Cooper also selected Young as his co-star. Much of the film was shot at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, where Cooper built the town of Payneville for the script. This Western set was used in many other productions over the next 20 years. Other outdoor filming locations included Sasabe, Tucson, and Nogales, Arizona. A number of exterior scenes were filmed in indoor sound stages backed by giant cycloramas. Scenes of the actors riding horses and exchanging dialogue were filmed with rear-projection screens. Critical reception Martin and Porter's DVD guide describes Along Came Jones as a \\"[h]ighly watchable comic western,\\" giving it a rating of 4 out of 5 (\\"Very Good\\").Mick Martin and Marsha Porter (2006). DVD and Video Guide 2007, Ballantine Books, p. 26. Variety called the film \\"a better-than-average western\\" and commended Cooper's and Young's performances. Bosley Crowther writes in his review for The New York Times: \\"Mr. Cooper is the guy who can play it. His Melody is a most congenial gent‚Äîbutter-fingered and mentally clumsy, but disarmingly winning withal\\". A Trailers from Hell review wrote that the film \\"is concocted to please the Cooper fans, a mix of comedy, sentiment, romance and a little fancy gunplay\\". This review calls the film's first act \\"almost as funny as a Preston Sturges movie\\", and the first two acts \\"nearly flawless\\". Radio adaptation Along Came Jones was presented on This Is Hollywood December 28, 1946. Janet Blair and Joel McCrea starred in the adaptation. In popular culture The film's ironic title probably inspired the popular 1959 Coasters song \\"Along Came Jones\\" written by Leiber and Stoller; songwriter Mike Stoller had studied orchestration under Arthur Lange, the composer of the film's score. In the film Cooper sings the song \\"I'm a Poor Lonesome Cowboy\\", which would later become the signature song of Lucky Luke in the eponymous comics series by Ren√© Goscinny and Morris.https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/10/12/een- stille- revolutionair-4786802-a1526307https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/morris.htm ReferencesExternal links *Along Came Jones at Dan Duryea Central   Iverson Movie Ranch: History, vintage photos.

() is a 1980 Italian horror film directed by Umberto Lenzi. The film is about a young woman (Janet Agren) who is searching for her sister after her abduction by a cult in the jungles of New Guinea. Synopsis A woman named Sheila is searching for her sister, who has disappeared in the jungles of New Guinea. Sheila (Janet Agren) joins up with Mark (Robert Kerman), and they both encounter many perils while searching for Sheila's sister, Diana (Paola Senatore). Diana has joined a cult run by a man called Jonas (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas physically and sexually abuses his followers and local people alike. In one graphic scene, he rapes Sheila with a dildo covered in snake blood, and decapitates a native. In another, a native widow named Mowara (Me Me Lai) is ritualistically raped after her late husband's body is burned on a pyre. A group, consisting of Mowara, Mark, Sheila and Diana escapes into the jungle, where Diana and Mowara are caught by a group of cannibals, with Diana raped and then both slowly cut up and eaten before being hacked to death, while Mark and Sheila helplessly watch from the cover of the bushes. They quickly escape back to New York when helicopters sent by the authorities come looking for them. Back in the village, the rest of the cult commits ritual suicide, leaving one young female survivor for the authorities to find.

It was released under the alternative title Doomed to Die in the United States. Reception From contemporary reviews, the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that the plotting and staging of the film as \\"chaotic\\" while finding that the film was \\"brightened by occasional moments of unintended hilarity, as when the drugged ambrosia is ritually consumed to the accompaniment of a robust chorus of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\"\\" From retreospective reviews, the assistant professor Danny Shipka of Louisiana State University described the film as Lenzi capitalizing on public interest in cult leader Jim Jones and referring to it as a \\"ridiculous film\\".Shipka, 2011. p. 136 Online film database AllMovie gave the film a one and a half star out of five rating, noting that the film includes \\"Stone Age cannibals, a Jim Jones-type cult, hired assassins, and gratuitous animal slaughters thrown onscreen every five minutes just to keep the viewer awake.\\" The review also commented on the themes of the film, stating that \\"Both of the leading characters are given a backstory of having exploited blacks in their Alabama cotton mill, only to lose all their ill-gotten money and ‚Äì in one case ‚Äì pay the ultimate price, as one underclass avenges another half a world away.

After graduating from the Farmington State Normal School she attended the New England Conservatory of Music and became a school teacher. She married Edward Craig in July, 1908, and they moved from Maine to Esmond, North Dakota where Edward was president of a bank. Both Craig and her husband became involved in the Nonpartisan League, and in 1923, just three years after women won the right to vote, she was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives. She became known by the affectionate nickname, \\"Min\\",One Third of a Nation: Lorena Hickok Reports on the Great Depression, Lorena A. Hickok et al., University of Illinois Press, 1983, but also had a reputation as a serious and meticulous legislator. A 1927 report noted, 1 Craig served six consecutive sessions in the State legislature. During this time she also held the position of state president of the Non- Partisan League, and was a Republican National Committee woman from 1928 to 1932.Minnie D. Craig Papers, 1904‚Äì1955. Biography. North Dakota State University In addition to forging her own political career, Craig encouraged other women to become politically active: On January 3, 1933, she made history when she was elected Speaker of the House, the first time a woman had led a legislative body in the USA (in a permanent capacity). However, the session proved challenging for Craig. The House assembled in a temporary auditorium as the State Capitol had been consumed by fire. In addition, North Dakota was suffering from an agricultural depression caused by drought. Her tenure as an elected member of the legislature ended with that session, when she left to become a state worker for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. The following year she returned to the House in an administrative role, as assistant to the chief clerk. In the 1937 and 1939 sessions she fulfilled the role of chief clerk. On her retirement, Craig and her husband moved to California. She began writing an autobiography but, at 99 pages, left it unfinished around the time of the death of her husband in 1947. Craig moved back to Phillips, Maine, in 1959 and died in Farmington on July 2, 1966. Minnie D.

He was dubbed \\"the Mandela of the Balkans\\" by Albanian statesmen because of the length of his 28-year internment. He was born in Durr√´s, on the Adriatic coast. President Topi bestowed the Nation's Honor Order upon Pjet√´r Arbnori (post mortem).‚ÄúNation,s Honor for Pjet√´r Arbnori Biography Arbnori was orphaned at the age of seven when his father was killed while fighting against Enver Hoxha's partisans during the civil war that underlay World War II. Although he earned a gold medal when he graduated from high school at the age of 18, this did not suffice to earn him the right to go on to college, because of his early affiliation, while still a boy, with the resistance fighters struggling against the communist regime, together with his mother and two older sisters. After graduating, Arbnori found a job as a teacher. In a matter of a year, however, he was fired for political reasons. Once having completed his military service, young Arbnori roamed the mountains in search of a living, and started to labour in the fields as a farm hand. While holding down this job, he managed to enroll in the University of Tirana's Philology Department under fake documents, and succeeded in finishing a five-year correspondence course in half the time. In 1960, Arbnori began to teach literature at a school in the city of Kavaj√´. Here he soon gathered together with other intellectuals to form a Social-Democratic movement, in the hope of edging forward towards a pluralistic society. The Sigurimi (secret police) got wind of this and arrested seven of them. After a trial that lasted two years, which entailed lengthy interrogations and torture, he was sentenced to death. This verdict was subsequently commuted to 25 years' imprisonment, because the authorities hoped that Arbnori would eventually lead them to catching other ringleaders. In prison, Arbnori organized the inmates' protests and resistance. One of the ways he preserved his sanity was to write, at every opportunity he had. He would write in the tiniest possible lettering along the margins of the newspapers allotted to the prisoners to read. In this way, he put together a novel and many short stories, some of which have since been published. When his jail sentence was almost complete, his jailers added ten more years to it. The detention eventually ended in 1989. He was arrested at 26 and freed at the age of 54. His first job on being released was as an apprentice to a carpenter. It was in this last portion of his life that he married and had two children. Still unsubdued, Arbnori soon took part in the grassroots movement that was defying the regime, participating, less than five months after his release, in the anti-communist demonstration in Shkod√´r that overturned the statue of Stalin. With the first free ballot, Arbnori was elected to Parliament, and was later re-elected three more times. He was elected twice to the position of Chairman of the Parliament of AlbaniaChairman of Albanian ParliamentAlbanian Parliament honors Pjet√´r Arbnori from April 6, 1992 to July 24, 1997 and is also listed among the acting Presidents of Albania, with reference to April 1992. In 1997, his party lost the elections to the Socialist Party of Albania led by Fatos Nano, following the turmoil caused by reckless schemes that had caused the financial ruin of thousands. From the benches of the opposition, it soon became clear to Arbnori that there was a risk that the censorship that was customary under the old regime might be reinstated. Thus, when the state-owned television station refused to broadcast the statements and initiatives of the opposition party, he went on a hunger strike. It was here that the fame of \\"the Mandela of the Balkans\\" claimed the attention of many governments of the Western world, whose support forced the majority coalition in Parliament to review its stance and approve a formal guarantee of the independence of the press from state interference. This became known as \\"the Arbnori Amendment\\". Arbnori died of a brain hemorrhage in Italy, in 2006. The man who had survived imprisonment in Burrel Prison, sacrificing his entire youth to his principles, left two orphaned children, still in their teens. The government of Albania, which had by then reverted to the Democratic Party of Albania, saluted him with an official state ceremony. Soon after his death, the Ministry of the Tourism, Culture, Youth and Sports of Albania changed the name of Albania's main international cultural institution (International Center of Culture, formerly Enver Hoxha museum, also called Piramida) from \\"International Center of Culture\\" to ‚ÄúInternational Center of Culture Pjet√´r Arbnori‚Äù.

It is a low growing plant with an erect upright habit or sometimes with ascending tops with bright yellow flowers. Plants bloom in late spring through the summer into early autumn. As plants bloom the stems extend upward and when finished blooming plants are 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant is native to Eurasia but is an introduced species in many areas of the world, including much of North America. A population of E. gallicum was studied in a limestone quarry near Syracuse, New York between 1976 and 1981.

He flourished about the end of the thirteenth century. He was born either at Barcelona, or at Toledo. He is sometimes confused with Zerahiah ben Isaac ha-Levi Saladin, also a translator. Life Zerahiah went to Rome about 1277, and wrote all his works there before 1290. In writing to the physician Hillel of Verona, he makes the point that while commenting upon the difficult passages of the Moreh, he followed the criticisms of Na·∏•manides. It may be inferred from his commentary to the Book of Job that Arabic was his native language. Works He wrote a philosophical commentary to the Book of Proverbs, finished November 28, 1288; another to Job, in which he derives many words from the Arabic. Both commentaries were published by Schwarz: the former in \\"Ha-Sha·∏•ar\\" (ii. 65-80, 105-112, 169-176, 209-240, 281-288, 300-314) under the title of \\"Imre Da'at\\"; the latter in his \\"Ti·∏≥wat Enosh\\" (Berlin, 1868). He wrote also a commentary on difficult, passages of the Moreh of Maimonides, comparing the work with that of Aristotle. In his writings such as on the Book of Job Zerahiah ben Shealtiel ·∏§en was one of the Talmudic scholars to identify metaphors following Maimonides.Robert Eisen Associate Professor of Religious Studies George Washington University The Book of Job in Medieval Jewish Philosophy 2004 p120 \\"Moreover, Zerahfiiah gives us insight into the parallel between the Garden of Eden story and the Job story alluded to ... both Satan and Job's wife are metaphors for the evil inclination, a motif Zerahfiiah seems to identify with the imagination.\\" Zerahiah was a prolific translator from Arabic into Hebrew of philosophical and medical works. Among his translations are the following: *Aristotle's \\"Physics\\" under the Hebrew title \\"Sefer ha-·π¨eba'\\"; *\\"Metaphysics\\" under the title of \\"Mah she-A·∏•ar ha-Teba'\\"; *\\"De C≈ìlo et Mundo\\" under the title of \\"Ha-Shamayim weha-'Olam\\"; *\\"De Anima\\" under the title of \\"Sefer ha- Nefesh\\"; *\\"Liber de Causis\\" under the title of \\"Ha-Bi'ur ha-·π¨ob ha-Gamur\\"; *Averroes's Middle Commentaries to Aristotle's \\"Physics,\\" \\"Metaphysics,\\" and \\"De C≈ìlo et Mundo,\\" and the commentary of Themistius to the last-named work; *The first two books of Avicenna's \\"Canon\\"; *Al-Farabi's \\"Risalah fl Mahiyyat al-Nafs\\" (Treatise on the Substance of the Soul), the Hebrew title of which is \\"Ma'mar be-Mahut ha-Nefesh\\" (published by Edelmann in his \\"·∏§emdah Genuzah,\\" K√∂nigsberg, 1856); *A medical work of Galen under the title of \\"Sefer he- ·∏§ola'im weha-Mi·∏≥rim\\" (The Book of Diseases and Accidents), from the Arabic of ·∏§unain ibn Is·∏•a·∏≥; *Three chapters of Galen's ŒöŒ±œÑŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆ, with the same title in Hebrew characters; *Maimonides's treatise on sexual intercourse (\\"Fial- Jima'\\"); *The \\"Aphorisms\\" of Maimonides (\\"Fu·π£ul Musa\\"), terminated at Rome in 1277.

It was first published in Weird Tales in 1935 and has been variously republished, notably in the anthology The Spell of Seven, edited by L. Sprague de Camp. Described by de Camp in his introduction to the story as 'one of the most horrible' of Smith's tales, it chronicles the life and death of the dread sorcerer Namirrha. Plot synopsis Namirrha was once known as Narthos, a beggar boy of Ummaos, the chief city of Xylac. Trampled almost to death by the horse of Prince Zotulla, he leave the city and becomes a willing pupil of a wizard, driving his own bond with Thasaidon, Lord of the Seven Hells and God of Earthly Evil. He becomes fabled as a mighty and dreaded necromancer/sorcerer, but is still driven to avenge himself on Zotulla. He returns to Xylac and builds in one night a palace in view of that of Zotulla, now King of Xylac. Every night phantom horses haunt Zotulla's palace, depriving all of sleep. Then Namirrha seeks the aid of Thasaidon to destroy the king, but the arch-fiend refuses his request, stating that his intended revenge would deprive Thasaidon of a great number of loyal subjects. Angrier than ever, he makes a pact with an even greater and more dangerous entity, Thamagorgos, Lord of the Abyss. He invites the king and his court to a great feast. While Zotulla is contemplating whether to go or not, a group of rotting mummies with rats and demons in their chests, with gigantic skeletons following them, enter the hall. Ordering Zotulla and his mistress, Obexah, to follow them to Namirrah's palace, the giant skeletons hypnotize the rest of the palace inhabitants with demonic silver flutes. They enter an impossibly huge chamber filled with demons and corpses. There, Obexah and Zotulla are seated next to Namirrha, and are served by victims of their own cruelty (Zotulla by his murdered father, and Obexah by her murdered lover). Then demon musicians and singers play, followed by gigantic horrifying dancers, who crush all of the guests (who have been magically tied to the floor in a crimson fog). Then Namirrha takes Zotulla and his mistress to a balcony that is stunningly high above the earth. The mighty cosmic horses of Thamagorgos, at Namirrha's command, appear and literally trample the city like ants, sparing only Namirrha's own palace. Namirrha reveals the reason for all this destruction to the king. Zotulla's mistress is tied to an altar. Namirrha commands the king to drink a poisoned draught and does so himself; the spirit of the wizard enters Zotulla's body, and the helpless spirit of Zotulla is imprisoned in a statue of Thaisadon. Zotulla is then forced to watch as Namirrha tortures Zotulla's mistress. Zotulla wishes for the power to stop this, and Thasaidon, furious at Namirrha, grants Zotulla the power to smite Namirrha down. He strikes the wizard down with the mace in the statue's hand. By Thasaidon's command, the spirit of Zotulla goes free into oblivion, whilst that of Namirrha, who has offended him, returns to his body, bereft of memory and sense, and attacks his own reflection in a mirror (thinking it variantly Zotulla and himself, switching between identities and sanity). Obexah, screaming on the altar, laughs insanely, while the macrocosmic stallions of Thamagorgos return through the skies to crush the palace of Namirrha.

Born in Fife, he studied in Italy and England, before gaining a reputation as a portrait painter. Early life Born in Anstruther Easter, he was the first of the five children of John Martin (1699/1700‚Äì1772), Anstruther Easter's parish schoolmaster, and his second wife, Mary Boyack (?1702‚Äì1783). Painting career Thomas Hay 9th Earl of Kinnoull Martin accompanied his art teacher, the portrait painter Allan Ramsay on his tour of Italy in 1756‚Äì7, and after returning became a student at the St Martin's Lane Academy in London. There he gained premiums for life drawing in each year from 1759 to 1761. He also joined Ramsay's studio in the 1760s as its principal draughtsman, helping to produce many of the coronation portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte. Martin had his own studio by 1770, by which time he had also produced his first self-portrait (now in the National Gallery of Scotland). It shows him with a clear fair skin, wavy ginger hair, aquiline nose and small red lips. Martin painted over 300 portraits in his lifetime. One of the earliest independent ones is that of Benjamin Franklin (now in the White House, Washington, DC), painted in 1767. His most influential works depict Scottish Enlightenment figures like the chemist Joseph Black (1787, Scottish National Portrait Gallery) and the philosopher David Hume (1770, now in a private collection), and noblewomen such as the Honourable Barbara Gray (1787). His Dictionary of National Biography entry states that \\"He portrayed his sitters with integrity in an honest natural style, thereby consolidating a recognizably Scottish tradition of portraiture\\". Martin exhibited at the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1765 to 1777 (being elected its treasurer, vice-president, and president between 1772 and 1777), at the Free Society of Artists in 1767 and at the Royal Academy in 1779 and 1790. He is listed in 1766 as a member of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, as \\"History Painter, living in Soho Square\\".A list of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. London, 1766. ESTC T062344 Benjamin Franklin by David Martin ‚Äì a portrait now in the White House As well as producing his own paintings, Martin copied them himself in highly-praised mezzotints, such as those of Lady Frances Manners (1772), impressions of which may be seen in the British Museum, under catalogue entries 1887 0406 87 and 1887 0406 142. He also executed line engravings, such as that of William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield (an impression of which is held in the library of Lincoln's Inn), as well as producing engravings of landscapes. In 1780, Martin returned to Edinburgh (although not selling his home in High Street, Dartford, until 1782), a move signalled by his admittance to the Royal Company of Archers and a rare full- length portrait he painted of its president, Sir James Pringle of Stichill (1791‚Äì4). In 1785, Martin was appointed principal painter in Scotland to the Prince of Wales. Martin died in 1797 at his home, 4 St James Square, Edinburgh, and was buried on 3 January 1798, in the graveyard at South Leith Parish Church. In 1799, his home and studio contents sold at an auction which took 21 days. In 2018, as a result of research done by the BBC-TV program Fake or Fortune?, Martin was verified as the artist who painted the portrait of Dido Elizabeth Belle and her cousin Elizabeth, a work that had previously been attributed to Johan Zoffany. Family On 20 July 1771, Martin married Ann Hill (1743‚Äì1775), but all three of their children died in infancy.

He was the youngest son of Emperor Paul I of Russia and Duchess Sophie Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg. Early life She was born in Stuttgart, as Princess Charlotte of W√ºrttemberg, eldest daughter of Prince Paul of W√ºrttemberg and of Princess Charlotte of Saxe- Hildburghausen. As a child, Charlotte lived in Paris with her father and her younger sister Pauline. Their home was quite modest by royal standards. In Paris Charlotte came under the tutelage of several intellectuals. Marriage and issue In 1822, she became engaged to Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed (Mikhail's mother was her father's aunt). It was said that Charlotte was an exceptional girl, highly intelligent and mature for her age of 15.Zeepvat, p.19. The Grand Duke was obviously impressed by her beauty and her poise, and during a reception held in her honor, she charmed all the guests with her conversations. On 17 December 1823, she was received into the Russian Orthodox Church and was given the name Elena Pavlovna.Zeepvat, p.20. On 20 February 1824, the couple married in Saint Petersburg and settled in the Mikhailovsky Palace. When the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna died in 1828, the palace of Pavlovsk passed on to Mikhail and he and Elena visited it often. Their marriage was not a happy one: Mikhail's only passion was for the army and he neglected Elena. Nevertheless, he and Elena had five daughters: * Grand Duchess Maria Mikhailovna of Russia (9 March 1825 Moscow ‚Äì 19 November 1846 Vienna); died unmarried. * Grand Duchess Elizabeta Mikhailovna of Russia (26 May 1826 Moscow ‚Äì 28 January 1845 Wiesbaden); married Adolf, Duke of Nassau and died in childbirth. * Grand Duchess Ekaterina Mikhailovna of Russia (28 August 1827 ‚Äì 12 May 1894), married Duke Georg August of Mecklenburg-Strelitz * Grand Duchess Alexandra Mikhailovna of Russia (28 January 1831 Moscow ‚Äì 27 March 1832 Moscow) * Grand Duchess Anna Mikhailovna of Russia (27 October 1834 Moscow ‚Äì 22 March 1836 Saint Petersburg) Influence at the Russian court Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855 Elena was a close friend of her brother-in-law, Alexander I of Russia and his wife the Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna. She was also quick to befriend the shy Maria Alexandrovna, the wife of the then Tsarevich Alexander. When Princess Charlotte's husband died, in 1849, she became a patron of several charitable organizations and the arts. She founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatoire as well as a group of nursing sisters which would eventually become the forerunners of the Red Cross in Russia. During her time in Russia, she became known as the \\"family intellectual\\", and was considered the most exceptional woman in the family since Catherine the Great.

It has elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs and cylindrical, greenish yellow to red flowers usually arranged singly or in groups of up to seven in leaf axils with the stamens protruding beyond the end of the corolla. Description Correa lawrenceana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of , sometimes a tree to , and has branchlets covered with rusty hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, elliptical to egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole up to long. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to seven in leaf axils, rarely on the ends of branchlets, each flower on a pedicel long. The calyx is hemispherical to cup-shaped, long and wide. The corolla is cylindrical, greenish yellow to red with a scaly to velvety surface, long with four short lobes on the end. The stamens project well beyond the end of the corolla. Flowering occurs in spring and sporadically at other times. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1834 by English botanist William Jackson Hooker who gave it the name Correa lawrenciana and published the description in his journal, The Journal of Botany. The specific epithet honours Tasmanian botanist Robert William Lawrence (1807-1833) who, together with Ronald Gunn, collected the plant material sent to Hooker. In 1998, Paul Wilson corrected the name to Correa lawrenceana to conform to the Tokyo Code. A subgenus of Correa (Correa subgenus Persistens Othman, Duretto and G.J. Jord.) was formally described in 2011 comprising two species, C. lawrenceana and C. baeuerlenii Unlike other Correa species, C. lawrenceana does not readily form hybrids with other species. The names of eight varieties are accepted at the Australian Plant Census: * Correa lawrenceana var. cordifolia Paul G.Wilson, commonly known as pink mountain-correa is distinguished by its broadly elliptic to broadly heart-shaped leaves, and hairy calyx long; * Correa lawrenceana var. genoensis Paul G.Wilson, commonly known as Genoa River correa is distinguished by its broadly elliptic to broadly heart-shaped leaves and glabrous green calyx long; * Correa lawrenceana var. glandulifera Paul G.Wilson has elliptic or egg-shaped leaves, a shallow hemispherical calyx about long covered with star-shaped hairs and a yellowish green corolla; * Correa lawrenceana var. grampiana Paul G.Wilson, commonly known as Grampians mountain-correa, has leathery, broadly elliptical leaves, a calyx covered with woolly rust-coloured hairs and a cylindrical corolla covered with velvety hairs; * Correa lawrenceana. var. latrobeana (F.Muell. ex Hannaford) Paul G.Wilson is distinguished by its broadly elliptic to broadly heart-shaped leaves, and hairy calyx long; * Correa lawrenceana Hook. var. lawrenceana has narrow elliptical leaves long and a green corolla; * Correa lawrenceana var. macrocalyx (Blakely) Paul G.Wilson is similar to var. cordifolia but has a calyx long; * Correa lawrenceana var. rosea Paul G.Wilson, has narrow elliptical leaves long, a calyx long and a narrow cylindrical corolla that is pink to dull red with green lobes. Some varieties grade into each other, and the delineation between them is imprecise. Distribution and habitat The species is found in rainforest and sclerophyll forest in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland. Variety cordifolia grows in forest on the coast and tablelands of southern New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and far north-eastern Victoria. Variety genoensis is only known from the banks of the Genoa River near the New South Wales - Victoria border. Variety glandulifera is found in the mountains from the Gibraltar Range in New South Wales to the McPherson Range in south- eastern Queensland. Variety grampiana grows among rocks in montain areas, mainly in the Grampians. Variety latrobeana is found in south-eastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria. Variety lawrenceana occurs in mountainous areas in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, var. macrocalyx is found in mountainous areas between the Taree and the Illawarra regions in New South Wales and var. rosea is only found in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales. Ecology The flowers are presumed to be pollinated by either birds or bees. Use in horticulture Correa lawrenceana is suited to a cool, moist, partly shaded position and is known to tolerate frost and snow. It can be used as a screening plant and will attract honeyeaters to the garden. Plants are easily propagated from cuttings, whereas seed can be difficult.

EtherNet/IP is one of the leading industrial protocols in the United States and is widely used in a range of industries including factory, hybrid and process. The EtherNet/IP and CIP technologies are managed by ODVA, Inc., a global trade and standards development organization founded in 1995 with over 300 corporate members. EtherNet/IP uses both of the most widely deployed collections of Ethernet standards ‚Äìthe Internet Protocol suite and IEEE 802.3 ‚Äì to define the features and functions for its transport, network, data link and physical layers. EtherNet/IP performs at level session and above (level 5, 6 and 7) of the OSI model. CIP uses its object-oriented design to provide EtherNet/IP with the services and device profiles needed for real-time control applications and to promote consistent implementation of automation functions across a diverse ecosystem of products. In addition, EtherNet/IP adapts key elements of Ethernet‚Äôs standard capabilities and services to the CIP object model framework, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which EtherNet/IP uses to transport I/O messages. Ethernet/IP was estimated to have about 30% share of the industrial ethernet market in 2010 and 2018.  History  Development of EtherNet/IP began in the 1990s within a technical working group of ControlNet International, Ltd.(CI), another trade and standards development organization, In 2000, ODVA and CI formed a joint technology agreement (JTA) for the development of EtherNet/IP. In 2009, the JTA was terminated and EtherNet/IP became under the sole control of ODVA and its members. Today, EtherNet/IP is one of four networks that adapt CIP to an industrial network along with DeviceNet, ControlNet and CompoNet. All of these networks are managed by ODVA, Inc.  Technical Detail  EtherNet/IP classifies Ethernet nodes into predefined device types with specific behaviors. Among other things, this enables: * Transfer of basic I/O data via User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based implicit messaging * Uploading and downloading of parameters, setpoints, programs and recipes via TCP (i.e., explicit messaging.) * Polled, cyclic and change-of-state monitoring via UDP. * One-to-one (unicast), one-to-many (multicast), and one-to-all (broadcast) communication via IP. * EtherNet/IP makes use of TCP port number 44818 for explicit messaging and UDP port number 2222 for implicit messaging  Open-source implementation  A portable open- source implementation named OpENer was started in 2009.

The Caroline Divines were influential theologians and writers in the Anglican Church who lived during the reigns of King Charles I and, after the Restoration, King Charles II (Latin: Carolus). There is no official list of Caroline-era divines; they are defined by the era in which they lived, and Caroline Divines hailed from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. However, of these four nations, it is Caroline England which is most commonly considered to have fostered a golden age of Anglican scholarship and devotional writing, despite the socio-cultural upset of civil war, regicide, and military rule under Oliver Cromwell. Importantly, the term divine is restricted neither to canonised saints nor to Anglican figures, but is used of many writers and thinkers in the wider Christian church. Theology and outlook William Laud The corpus produced by the Caroline divines is diverse. What they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by Scripture and the Book of Common Prayer, thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the Apostolic Fathers and other later Christian writers. On the whole, the Caroline Divines view the via media of Anglicanism not as a compromise but \\"a positive position, witnessing to the universality of God and God's kingdom working through the fallible, earthly ecclesia Anglicana.\\" These theologians regarded Scripture as authoritative in matters concerning salvation, although they drew upon tradition and reason as well, the latter in the form of deductive logic and the former with special reference to the Church Fathers. Politically, the Caroline Divines were royalists but primarily of a constitutional, rather than absolutist, bent. Their promotion of more elaborate ceremonial and their valuation of visual beauty in art and church architecture was variously labelled as ‚Äúpopish‚Äù, ‚ÄúRomish‚Äù, or ‚ÄúArminian‚Äù by their Puritan opponents. Such embellishments, however, were not only integral to their spirituality, but were seen by the Carolines as combatting the appeal of Roman Catholicism. And, contrary to Puritan accusation, the emphasis upon beauty had nothing to do with ‚ÄúArminian‚Äù influence. Rather than face a choice between an austere Puritanism or an elaborate Roman ceremonial, the Caroline divines presented their countrymen with a via media in which they could remain within the established church and also participate in ancient forms of religion.K. A. Newman, ‚ÄúHoliness in Beauty?: Roman Catholics, Arminians, and the Aesthetics of Religion in Early Caroline England.‚Äù in D. Wood (ed.) The Church and the Arts. (Oxford, 1992), pp. 303‚Äì312 Prominent exponents Within the Anglican tradition, there have been certain theological writers whose works have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, worship, and spirituality. These are often commemorated in lesser feasts of the Church, and their works are frequently anthologised. Among the Caroline divines of the seventeenth century, the following are prominent. King Charles the Martyr King Charles I (19 November 1600 ‚Äì 30 January 1649) encouraged liturgical renewal and the publication of devotional writings during his reign. The most popular devotional work in seventeenth-century England was the king's own autobiographical Eikon Basilike (The Royal Image), which was translated into numerous European languages. He defended popular recreational activities through his re-publication of the Book of Sports in 1633, which was originally promulgated by his father, King James I, in 1617. Charles I also stood against the advance of extreme predestinarian theology in the Church of England, principally through his Declaration on the Articles of Religion (1628). When the Book of Common Prayer was revised in 1662, this declaration was permanently affixed as the preface to the Articles of Religion. Like both his predecessors and successors, Charles I was said to have the Royal touch, which he practiced during his lifetime, and miracle stories were attributed to the king's relics after his death. Charles I was canonised by the Church of England as King Charles the Martyr, the first Anglican saint, and placed as such in the 1662 Calendar of Saints. However 30 January, the date of his martyrdom, was not denoted as a feast, but as a fast intended for annual reflection and repentance. Lancelot Andrewes Lancelot Andrewes (1555 ‚Äì 25 September 1626) was an English priest and scholar, who held high positions in the Church of England during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. He was the spiritual father of Charles I. During the reign of King James I, Andrewes served as Bishop of Chichester and oversaw the translation of the Authorized Version (or King James Version) of the Bible. In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a Lesser Festival. His most popular work has proven to be his Preces Privatae or Private Prayers, which was published posthumously and has remained in print since renewed interest in Andrewes developed in the 19th century. His Ninety-Six Sermons have been occasionally reprinted and are considered among the most rhetorically developed and polished sermons of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Because of these, Andrewes has been commemorated by literary greats such as T. S. Eliot. John Cosin John Cosin (30 November 1594 ‚Äì 15 January 1672) was an English priest, bishop and theologian. Cosin was elected Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1634, succeeding Matthew Wren, and decorated the chapel there according to High Church principles.Cross, F. L.; Livingstone, E. A. (eds.) (2005). The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (4th ed.) Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 424. Among his writings (most of which were published posthumously) are a Historia Transubstantiationis Papalis (1675), Notes and Collections on the Book of Common Prayer (1710) and A Scholastical History of the Canon of Holy Scripture (1657). A collected edition of his works, forming 5 vols of the Oxford-based Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology, was published between 1843 and 1855; and his Correspondence (2 vols) was edited by George Ornsby for the Surtees Society (1868‚Äì1870). Cosin's most important work was his Collection of Private Devotions which was published in 1627 at the behest of King Charles I. It made use of patristic sources, Elizabethan devotional material, and Cosin's own compositions. This was the first work of royally-authorised devotional writing since the reign of Elizabeth I and was immensely popular in the seventeenth century. Cosin was exiled in Paris during the Commonwealth, but was made Bishop of Durham at the Restoration in 1660, a post he held until his death. Thomas Ken Thomas Ken (July 1637 ‚Äì 19 March 1711), English priest, was the most eminent of the English non-juring bishops, and one of the fathers of modern English hymnology. His Three Hymns (1700) contains the original version of the hymn 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow', which continues to be sung during offertories around the world, especially in Anglican churches. Ken later left the Church of England during the Nonjuring schism, which developed in response to the invasion of England by the Dutch prince William III. However, as a Nonjuror, Ken remained deeply tied to the Anglican tradition. Nonjurors did not abandon Anglicanism but instead maintained allegiance to the exiled king James II of England. The political counterpart to the Nonjuror schism was Jacobitism. Both ended in the latter half of the eighteenth century with the death of Charles Edward Stuart, the last Stuart claimant to the throne. Nonjuror liturgical, theological, and devotional writing proved to have a considerable impact upon the Anglican tradition, in part due to the influence of the nineteenth-century Oxford Movement. William Laud Archbishop William Laud (7 October 1573 ‚Äì 10 January 1645) was Archbishop of Canterbury and a fervent supporter of King Charles I of England. Laud was a sincere Anglican and loyal Englishman, who must have been frustrated at the charges of Popery levelled against him by the Puritan element in the Church. Laud's aggressive high church policy was seen by many as a sinister development. He was blamed for the introduction of the 1637 Book of Common Prayer into Scotland, although a similar policy had originated with King James I. Laud's Conference with Fisher the Jesuite is a classic work of Anglican apologetics and has been called 'one of the last great works of scholastic divinity.' Like Andrewes, Laud's Private Devotions were printed posthumously, although they have never been as popular as those by Andrewes. His views towards the Presbyterians extended to Scotland, where it led to the Covenanter movement and the Bishops' Wars. The Long Parliament of 1640 accused him of treason, resulting in his imprisonment in the Tower of London. In the spring of 1644, he was brought to trial, which ended without being able to reach a verdict. Parliament took up the issue, and eventually he was beheaded on 10 January 1645 on Tower Hill, notwithstanding being granted a royal pardon. Thomas Sprat Thomas Sprat (1635 ‚Äì 20 May 1713), was an English priest. Having taken orders he became a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral in 1660. In the preceding year he had gained a reputation by his poem To the Happie Memory of the most Renowned Prince Oliver, Lord Protector (London, 1659), and he was afterwards well known as a wit, preacher, and man of letters. His chief prose works are the Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier's Voyage into England (London, 1665), a satirical reply to the strictures on Englishmen in Samuel de Sorbi√®re's book of that name, and a History of the Royal Society of London (London, 1667), which Sprat had helped to found. The History of the Royal Society elaborates the scientific purposes of the academy and outlines some of the strictures of scientific writing that set the modern standards for clarity and conciseness. The work also contains theological defences of scientific study. Jeremy Taylor Jeremy Taylor (1613 ‚Äì 13 August 1667) was a priest in the Church of England who achieved fame as an author during The Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. He is sometimes known as the \\"Shakespeare of Divines\\" for his poetic style of writing. Taylor was educated at The Perse School, Cambridge before going onto Gonville and Caius College, at Cambridge, where he graduated in 1626. He was under the patronage of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. He went on to become chaplain in ordinary to King Charles I as a result of Laud's sponsorship. This made him politically suspect when Laud was tried for treason and executed in 1645 by the Puritan Parliament during the English Civil War. After the Parliamentary victory over the King, he was briefly imprisoned several times. Eventually, he was allowed to retire to Wales, where he became the private chaplain of the Earl of Carbery. Upon the Restoration, his political star was on the rise, and he was made Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland. He was also made vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin. Herbert Thorndike Herbert Thorndike (1598‚Äì1672) was Canon of Westminster Abbey. He was also an influential theologian and writer in the Anglican Church who was well respected during the reigns of King Charles I and, after the Restoration, King Charles II. His work had little influence, however, and it was not until the Oxford Movement of the 19th century that he came to be widely read again.

Concept Sibylline is a female mouse who lives in the forest Bosquet Jojeux, which is an anthropomorphic version of real city life. Much like Chlorophylle the stories appear to be a funny animal fantasy strip, but in fact have a darker, satirical edge.http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/series6/sibylline.htm As the series progressed more fantastical elements started to occur, such as ghosts, wizards and vampires.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/macherot.htm Characters * Sibylline: The star of the series. She is a gentle, clever and brave female mouse, but can be jealous and hot-headed. Originally she lived in a house, but later she moved to the forest. She wears a yellow bonnet and a blue dress. * Taboum: Her dim-witted husband, who is very clumsy and a male version of the damsel in distress. Just like her he is a mouse. * Flouzemaker: A crow who is a cigar smoking business man. * Brigadier Verboten: A strict and authoritarian hedgehog who guards the forest. He wears a paper hat and a sheriff badge. His last name is a pun on the German word for \\"Forbidden\\". * Anath√®me Percemiche: The major antagonist of the series.

History In 1964 Raymond Macherot left Tintin, where he had drawn Chlorophylle for many years. Contractually he was unable to take his characters with him, except for the antagonist Anthracite, whom he kept. In 1965 he created the series Sybilline for the rival magazine Spirou.http://www.bdoubliees.com/journalspirou/series6/sibylline.htm The tone and atmosphere were very similar to Chlorophylle. Scripts were written by Macherot and Paul Deli√®ge. After Macherot quit drawing Taymans took over. The series ran in Spirou until 1990.

Tbilisi, Georgia David Baazov (; 1883‚Äì1947) was a Georgian-Jewish public and religious figure who spearheaded the Zionist movement in Georgia. His program was an amalgam of moderate orthodox religiosity, enlightenment, and Zionism. He was born in Tskhinvali, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire) into a family of rabbis. He was educated in Jewish philosophy and history at Slutsk and Vilnius where he became exposed to Zionist ideas. 1903 In 1903, he attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel. Returning to Georgia, Baazov became a rabbi in the town of Oni and quickly emerged as a leader of Zionism in Georgia. His growing influence was opposed by a group of anti-Zionist rabbis and the so-called \\"assimilationist\\" Jewish intellectuals who put forward the thesis that the Georgian Jews were ethnic Georgians and \\"Israelites by religion.\\"Yaacov Ro‚Äôi, Avi Beker (1991), Jewish Culture and Identity in the Soviet Union, p. 390. NYU Press, . 1918 In 1918, Baazov founded the first Georgian-Jewish Zionist paper ebraelis khma (\\"The Voice of Jew\\") and helped organize the All-Jewish Congress in Tbilisi which included representatives from every Georgian and Russian Jewish community in the country, except for Kutaisi, which had become the center of the Jewish anti-Zionism. At that time, he served as a rabbi in Akhaltsikhe and exploited his friendly ties with a local Muslim clergy to save many Christians during a brief Ottoman occupation of the area in 1918. 1921-1925 After the Sovietization of Georgia in 1921, Baazov, aided by his son, the leading Georgian-Jewish writer Gerzel Baazov, organized Jewish schools across the country and later founded the magazine makaveeli (\\"Maccabean\\") which was closed by the Soviet authorities during a crackdown on Georgian Jewish cultural institutions after the 1924 anti-Soviet August Uprising in Georgia. Next year, he managed to secure the free passage for several Georgian Jewish families to the Land of Israel, launching the first large wave of Aliyah from Georgia. 1938-1945 During the purge of 1938, both of his sons were arrested by the Soviet NKVD and Gerzel was executed. Soon, David Baazov was also arrested and sentenced to death for \\"Zionist activities\\". The sentence was later commuted to exile in Siberia. In 1945, he returned to the Georgian SSR and chiefly engaged in educational activities. Legacy The main writer on David Baazov and the main collector of his works was his daughter Fanny Baazova (1912‚Äì1980).

Along with the Herzogenriedpark (33 hectares; on the other side of the Neckar river) it is operated by the non-profit Stadtpark Mannheim GmbH. History The Luisenpark was built between 1892 and 1903, formed upon the legacy of scientist professor Dr. Carl William Casimir Fox, who bequeathed 20,000 Deutsche Marks in his will to the city of Mannheim for the making of a new park. This amount was not sufficient for total financing, but formed a foundational start. Construction work began at the end of 1892. The design of the park was done by the Siesmayer brothers, Frankfurtlandscape gardeners. Conditions for the ascent of the Luisenparks for supraregional meaning was the resolution of the Mannheimer local council in November 18, 1969 to develop the Luisenpark as well as the Herzogenriedpark (to accomplish the Bundesgartenschau 1975). At that time the park was extended to a size of 41 hectares by the inclusion of a former racecourse. The sales of 186,000 season tickets, which was not even reached by all federal horticultural shows, the number of 8.1 million visitors, and the removal of the Luisenpark fence, convinced the city council to operate the Luisenpark as city park with entrance fee. However, on October 21, 1975, the decision for a closed Luisenpark with entrance fee fell. It was agreed to have two probationary years (Probejahre) of free entrance, but over 38,000 maps sold yearly demonstrated a convincing argument to maintain the free entrance to the park. Name The Luisenpark is named after princess Luise Marie Elizabeth of Prussia, a close relative of three German emperors: William I was her father, Frederick III was her brother and William II was her nephew. On September 26, 1856, when she was eighteen-years old, she married the Prince Regent, later Grand Duke of Baden, Frederick I. She carried out crucial pioneering work for the Wohlfahrtspflege in Baden. As an eighty-year-old, she, along with her daughter, Queen Victoria of Sweden, had to flee through a window from marauding soldiers attempting to take the castle in Karlsruhe.

The screenplay concerns the lives of a London couple and their three adult daughters and absent son. The film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.  Plot summary  The film follows the lives of three London sisters and their family over five days, a long Guy Fawkes Night weekend in November. Waitress Nadia, \\"shy, with a backpack and her hair in girlish twists\\", spends all her time going on blind dates with unsatisfactory men from personal ads, while her hairdresser sister Debbie struggles to raise her 11-year-old son without much help from his irresponsible father. Meanwhile, Molly is pregnant but her husband Eddie has left his job without telling her. Eileen and Bill, their parents, are virtually estranged since the departure of their eldest son Darren, who they have not heard from since he left home; having left, he is the only happy one in the family. Eileen takes her unsaid frustrations out on the neighbour's barking dog, poisoning it when it prevents her from sleeping. Franklin is an over-sensitive man who frequents the coffee house where Nadia works. He is unable to summon the courage to talk to her, instead listening to music he thinks she would like alone in his bedroom. Nadia sleeps with one of her dates, the handsome Tim, but he is not really interested in her. Molly and Eddie have a fight when she discovers he has left his job and he leaves. She goes into labour believing he has permanently left her, but he has really had an accident on his motorbike. Debbie's son, Jack, is mugged when his father Dan leaves him alone and Jack goes off on his own to watch fireworks. Darren finally calls to let his family know that he is fine and Franklin has enough courage to talk to Nadia. Molly and Eddie are reunited at hospital after the birth of their daughter, Alice, a name Eddie selected because of Alice in Wonderland. CastProduction The film's French writer, Laurence Coriat, was previously a psychology student. Winterbottom said that the script began in a similar way to Short Cuts and \\"the connections between the stories were purely down to geography\\" but was rewritten so that \\"the story of one sister tells you something about the other two.\\" Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt had previously only worked on documentaries and news footage. The film has both realist and impressionist elements. Time lapse photography is used to give moments of accelerated motion as the characters are followed, which Winterbottom said was inspired by Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express and gave an impressionistic feeling, \\"a rush of poignant colours and noise\\", and other footage is filmed on grainy hand-held 16mm cameras, giving a realist \\"fly-on- the-wall\\" feeling. The sex scenes are realistic and awkward ‚Äì the scene between Nadia and Tim features no music, which highlights the sounds of kissing and rustling. A small crew was used, with only natural lighting and no sound boom. A pub scene was shot with real people in the background, near closing time, and the caf√© where Nadia works is a real small caf√© in Soho. People alone in London crowds were picked out and filmed to make the audience speculate about their stories. The scenes where Dan takes his son to a football match were filmed at Selhurst Park, the ground of Crystal Palace in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Birmingham City on 6 February 1999. Senses of Cinema said that the editing was \\"immaculate and exciting\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack to Wonderland was composed by Michael Nyman, who has said it is his favourite score.BBC Radio 4 Film Programme, 5 December 2008 The New York Times compared the score to that of Stewart Copeland for Rumble Fish and said that \\"the rhythms are like a clock ticking\\" and it is \\"alternately plaintive and mournful\\". The Guardian said it was \\"sumptuous, romantic\\". Senses of Cinema said the music was \\"heart-wrenching, full of tragic qualities, yet also extremely light\\". Release The film's US debut was at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000. Critical reception The New York Times argued that a scene in which Nadia slowly descends into tears on a double-decker bus as others party around her was \\"one of the most riveting scenes in a movie this year\\" (a scene The Guardian also said \\"rings true\\"), but found that \\"there is no sad turn in these characters' lives that you cannot see coming about an hour before\\". The Guardian said that the filming of London's streets was similar to that of New York by Martin Scorsese, but complained about the characterisation, for example that with Nadia \\"we are given no insight into her struggles or her grinning social ineptitude,\\" leaving the film \\"alienating and infuriating.\\" They praised the acting, particularly the \\"desperately affecting\\" parents, but were annoyed by the attempts at Estuary English by the cast of non-Londoners. Senses of Cinema has called it \\"arguably one of Winterbottom's most accomplished works\\" and \\"a wonderful and very poignant film.\\" The New Statesman wrote in 2016 that the film \\"far exceeds anything made during the kitchen-sink period in the breadth of its humanism and the range of its social portraiture, and deserves to be recognised as one of the great achievements of British cinema.\\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2016/01/rebel-realist-cause Themes and analysis The New York Times said the film was \\"a modern-day London turn on Chekhov\\"'s Three Sisters and said that the sisters could be interpreted as different life stages of a single woman. The social realism of the film was compared to those of fellow British directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh. Although the film has \\"an almost unbearable sadness\\" it is not bleak. The end of the film has a \\"dramatic coincidence\\" that brings the characters together for Molly giving birth, a sentimental narrative device that is a change from the relative lack of structure of the rest of the film, though Sense of Cinema also saw this final scene as \\"genuinely uplifting\\" and only giving tentative hope for the characters.
