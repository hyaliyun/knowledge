Gender disparity in computing has become a global concern due to the emergence of the Information Age. Main concerns arose due to the growing gender disparity in the field of computing. The field of computing increasingly has developed a gender gap. This gender gap has made the field become more male dominant. With the decline in women pursuing education within the field of computer science and women working in field, lack of diversity in field emerged. Concerns of improving perspective in the field, creating more diversity, and attempting to close the gender gap motivated public policy debates addressing gender equality due to the growing importance of computing and technology in society. This dialogue helped to expand information technology innovations and to reduce the consequences of sexism. Growing concerns about the disparity in computing has allowed for the rise of organizations creating their own initiatives to bring women into the field of computer science.  Background  In the early days of computers and computing, women were well-represented in the field. Women often worked as \\"human computers,\\" making complicated calculations and working in large groups, such as the Harvard Computers. Women also worked on ballistics calculations and cryptography. In 1946, the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical engineering and the Unites States Army Ballistics Research Laboratory began to research the trajectories of projectiles. 200 women had been involved in this research. Human computers who were women could be paid less than their male counterparts. By 1943, the majority of human computers were women. Due to the lack of labor resources during the Second World War, women were actively recruited into computer jobs that would traditionally gone to men. Finding jobs in the computer science field allowed women to find higher opportunities in the workforce. Early programmers on machines such as ENIAC, were mostly women. The reason that women were involved as programmers and human computers was because \\"they expected programming to be a low skill clerical function,\\" and that the difficult work was the creation of the hardware, which male engineers largely worked on. The programmers of the ENIAC, six women who designed the public demonstrations and prepared the machine for its public debut were not fully recognized for their contributions by the media. Two women reprogram the ENIAC. Computer science was the fastest growing college major and popular STEM discipline among women from the 1970s until the 1980s. According to the National Science Foundation's data of women receiving a Bachelor of Science degree spanning four decades (1966-2006), computer science is the only STEM discipline facing a downward slope after its highest peak in 1984 with 37% of women receiving their degrees in compute science. Similar patterns exist in the computing workforce as well with a peak of 38% in 1987. By the 1960s, while computer programming was still touted as a good field for women to go into, major shifts were beginning to take place that would help push women out of the field. Men who were programming started to make the field more \\"prestigious,\\" creating professional associations, education requirements for work and by actively discouraging hiring women in the field. Hiring tools were introduced in which answers were shared among all-male groups and clubs. Another way to push women out of the field was to use personality tests that favored people who were not interested in working with others, which was slanted towards a certain type of male applicant. According to Janet Abbate, the work that the ENIAC women did during World War II was considered menial because of preconceived gender notions. Women were not allowed to work in developing hardware and so, over time, it became associated as a man's job. Software development was new and women worked that job because they had prior experience as 'human computers'. After these trends were entrenched in the industry, it has continued to perpetuate itself into the modern day. Some computer science programs, such as Princeton, in the mid-1960s wouldn't even admit women into their program. Gender gap A survey, conducted by SWIFT (\\"Supporting Women in Information Technology\\") based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, asked 7,411 participants questions about their career choices. The survey found that females compared to males have lower levels of interest and perceived ability in computer science. This study (as well as others) provides a strong base for a positive correlation between both level of interest and perceived ability with career choice. A project based in Edinburgh, Scotland, \\"Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society\\" (SIGIS) released its findings based on research conducted in 48 separate case studies all over Europe.Faulkner, Wendy (2004). \\"Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society - Final Report\\", SIGIS, University of Edinburgh. The findings focus on recruiting as well as retention techniques for women already studying in the field. These techniques range from the introduction of role models, advertisement campaigns, and the allocation of quotas, in order to make the computing field appear more gender neutral. Educating reforms, which will increase the quality of the educating body and technological facilities, are also suggested. Research suggests that Malaysia has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark. A job in the computing industry also implies a safe work environment. Strong belief by the previous generation that IT would be a flourishing sector with many job opportunities caused parents to encourage their children to take a computing career, no matter the gender. In India, a growing number of women are studying and taking careers in technical fields. The percentage of women engineers graduating from IIT Bombay grew from 1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005. Arab women made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science in 2014 at government universities located in Saudi Arabia. Women in Eastern Europe, especially in Bulgaria and Romania, have high rates of pursuing coding and technology. However, women remain underrepresented in information technology fields. Statistics in education In the United States, the proportion of women represented in undergraduate computer science education and the white-collar information technology workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of Computer Science degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.Camp, Tracy (2001). \\"Women in Computer Science: Reversing the Trend\\". Colorado School of Mines. Figures from the Computing Research Association Taulbee Survey indicate that fewer than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at U.S. PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.\\"Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends\\", 2010-2011 CRA Taulbee Survey. The Computing Research Association. When looking at the percentage of women earning master's degrees, it peaked around 2000 at 33% and dropped to 27% in 2008. Computer science holds one of the lowest proportion of women holding a doctorate's degree in the field. Within the United States, the representation of women in the computing field has declined over the past thirty years. Currently, women only make up 18% of graduates with a degree in computer science. In a study based in the United States, \\"Anatomy of an Enduring Gender Gap: The Evolution of Women's Participation in Computer Science\\", researchers found an overall decline in women's intent to major in the computer science field. They found that by 2011 only 0.4% of women planned to major in computer science compared to 3.3.% of men. The study also found, as of 2011, only 15% of women were computer science majors. Although teenage girls are now using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers, they are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes.Melkymuka, Kathleen (8 January 2001). \\"If Girls Don't Get IT, IT Won't Get Girls\\", Computer World. The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) reports that of the SAT takers who intend to major in computer and information sciences, the proportion of girls has steadily decreased relative to the proportion of boys, from 20 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2006.Stross, Randall (15 November 2008). \\"What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?\\", The New York Times. While this number has been decreasing, in 2001, the total number of these students (both boys and girls) reached its peak at 73,466. According to a College Board report, in 2006 there were slightly more girls than boys amongst SAT takers that reported to having \\"course work or experience\\" in computer literacy, word processing, internet activity, and creating spreadsheets/databases.2006 College-Bound Seniors - Total Group Profile Report , CollegeBoard SAT. It was also determined that more boys than girls (59% vs 41%) reported course work or experience with computer programming, although this may likely be caused by false reporting. Of the 146,437 students (13%) who reported having no course work or experience, 61% were girls and 39% were boys. More boys than girls take Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science exams. According to the College Board in 2006, 2,594 girls and 12,068 boys took the AP Computer Science A exam, while 517 girls and 4,422 boys took the more advanced AP Computer Science AB exam. From 1996 to 2004, girls made up 16‚Äì17% of those taking the AP Computer Science A exam and around 10% of those taking AP Computer Science AB exam. In England females made up 20% of GCSE and 10% of Alevel computer science cohorts in 2019 JCQ, GCSE (Full Course) Outcomes for key grades for UK, England, Northern Ireland & Wales, including UK age breakdowns Results Summer 2019 (2019), Joint Council for Qualifications. JCQ, GCE A Level & GCE AS Level Results Summer 2019 (2019), Joint Council for Qualifications.. Females outperformed males at GCSE computer science, but when controlling for their achievement in other subjects, i.e. attempting to compare males and females of similar grade profiles, males achieved significantly higher grades in computer science . Across all UK universities, females achieved significantly fewer first class degrees than males, a pattern not seen in other degree areas. Statistics in the workforce Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling from a peak of 38% in the mid-1980s. From 1993 through 1999, NSF's SESTAT reported that the percentage of women working as computer/information scientists (including those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher in an S&E; field or have a bachelor's degree or higher and are working in an S&E; field) declined slightly from 33.1% to 29.6% percent while the absolute numbers increased from 170,500 to 185,000.\\"Characteristics of Scientists and Engineers in the US\\", National Science Foundation. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Catalyst in 2006 indicated that women make up 27-29% of the computing workforce.Thomas J. Misa, ed. (2010). Gender Codes: Why Women Are Leaving Computing. Wiley/IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 32-34. A National Public Radio report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female. In open source fields, only 10% of programmers are women. Benefits of gender diversity A gender-diverse team is more likely to create products that meet people's requirements. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on men's experiences, opinions, and judgement, resulting in a male-slanted bias.https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/january- february-2014/are-you-sure-your-software-is-gender-neutral In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams, while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non- linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances. Research conducted by McKinsey & Company showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful, in contrast, analysis of sample major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance; these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the purely financial benefits of diversity. The book Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide states that the lack of participation of females in computing excludes them from the \\"new economy\\", which calls for sophisticated computer skills in exchange for high salary positions.Cooper, J.; Weaver, K. (2003). Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. In an article titled, \\"Diversity in Computing: Why It Matters and How Organizations Can Achieve It, Wendy M. DuBow looks into the benefits of gender diversity in the field of computer programming. In the article, DuBow found there to be missed potential when a workforce is not diverse. DuBow also found having a diverse team, in culture, gender and race, allowed for more creativity, innovation, and productivity. \\"Innovative Potential: Men and Women in Teams\\", a study produced by The Lehman Brothers Centre for Women in Business and the London Business School, found that teams with equal gender membership, from 21 different companies, were more efficient in their goals and more experimental. Factors contributing to lack of female participation=Education Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science dates from about 1984 following mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games. Fiddling with computers by boys resulted in increased interest and readiness for computer science classes by young men. A study of over 7000 high school students in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada showed that the degree of interest in the field of computer science for young women is comparably lower than that of young men.Handcock, Mark S. et al. (2004). \\"Focus on Women in Computer Science\\", University of British Columbia. Archived from the original on 10 May 2012. The same effect is seen in higher education; for instance, only 4% of female college freshmen expressed intention to major in computer science in the US. Research has shown that some aspects about computing may discourage women. One of the biggest turn-offs is the \\"geek factor\\". High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubicle writing code. The \\"geek factor\\" affects both male and female high school students, but it seems to have more of a negative effect on the female students. In addition, computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male, contributing to an absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers. However, in 2015, computer science has for the first time become the most popular major for female students at Stanford University. In part to qualify for federal education funding distributed through the states, most U.S. states and districts now focus on ensuring that all students are at least \\"proficient\\" in mathematics and reading, making it difficult for teachers to focus on teaching concepts beyond the test. According to a Rand Corporation study, such a concentration on testing can cause administrators to focus resources on tested subjects at the expense of other subjects (e.g., science) or distract their attention from other needs.Stecher, B. M. (2002). \\"Consequences of large-scale, high-stakes testing on school and classroom practice\\". In: Hamilton, L. S., B. M. Stecher, and S. P. Klein (Eds.). Making sense of test-based accountability in education. Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation. Thus, computational thinking is unlikely to be taught either standalone or as integrated into other areas of study (e.g., mathematics, biology) anytime in the near future. The National Center for Women & IT distributes free resources for increasing awareness of the need for teaching computer science in schools, including the \\"Talking Points\\" card, \\"Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science\\".Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science , National Center for Women & Information Technology. In 2014, Kelly Ward, Cornelia Dragne, and Angelina J Lucas conducted a study in Romania that examined gender disparity in computing. The article features statistics of female enrollment in computing programs at Romanian universities. The main topics of the article are representation, equality vs. equity, and the masculine image of computing and how it affects opportunities for women. Female and male perspectives A women sitting down, while using her computer. The sticker reads, \\"No, this is not my boyfriend's computer.\\" According to a 1998‚Äì2000 ethnographic study by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher at Carnegie Mellon University, men and women viewed computers very differently. Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.Margolis, J. et al. (1999). Unlocking the Clubhouse . The MIT Press. p.4. Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were \\"geeks,\\" with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers \\"become their life.\\" The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings. A two-year research initiative published in 2000 by AAUW found that \\"Girls approach the computer as a \\"tool\\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \\"toy\\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse \\"real\\" power and power on a screen. \\"I see a computer as a tool,\\" a high school girl declares. \\"You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way.\\"AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). \\"Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age\\", p.8. Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes. Nearly 1000 students in University of Akron were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males. Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in University of Winnipeg and obtained similar results. This is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field. Barriers to advancement Measures like experience, aptitude tests, and college degrees were used by companies to hire people for the job in the 1960s and onwards. The requirement of college degrees was not helpful for women to get a job. Many did not either think of pursuing further studies because of the societal expectation that women should be married and raise children. Not having adequate resources to attain a four-year degree also played a factor in not furthering their education. When word processors came into being in the 1980s, job titles and duties had to be reorganized. With more advanced machines to learn and use, receiving a college education became a must for prospective workers to be considered for a position. This left out women who weren't as educated or possessed enough money to afford higher education. Research on the barriers that women face in undergraduate computingCohoon, J. McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation , Chapter 5. The MIT Press. has highlighted such factors as: * Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the \\"weedout\\" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men. * Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst. * Well-meaning people who unwittingly create stereotype threat by reminding students that \\"women can do computing as well as men\\". * Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced. Just like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need \\"extra help\\" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the \\"extra help\\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men. Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills The need for experience helped women a lot better than the requirement of a college degree. They had more chances of gaining experience at a workplace than attaining a college degree. Aptitude tests were also a measure used by companies to determine who had the skills necessary for the job. It also made it easier for women to land jobs in the computing field because of its nature of objectivity, but it did not necessarily mean better treatment of women than men in the field. Societal and institutional assumptions of what gender and its capabilities were, were most likely to influence the positions of the women in the workplace then. As it changed over time, so did what women were capable of doing. The marriage bar and assumptions that women would not stay in the workplace for long after marriage became reasons for companies to deny promotions and increased salaries to women. With the advancement of technology, the complexity of the jobs also rose. This led to many women being unable to pursue those jobs as the companies handed them over to men. Pre-conceived notions of the abilities of men and women affected these decisions. Punch-card operations were mostly a woman's job in the second half of the 20th century. The conditions associated with this job - noisy rooms, heavy manual labor, no opportunity for growth, less pay, unfavorable work environments and behaviors - forced many women to eventually leave their jobs. A Harvard Business School report stated that due to negative experiences of keeping up with horrible work conditions, pressure to complete the work on a tight schedule, and dealing with male-dominated behaviors, half of the women joining the workforce left their jobs after working for ten years. Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Servon, L. J., Sherbin, L., Shiller, P., Sosnovich, E., & Sumberg, K. (2008). The Athena factor: Reversing the brain drain in science, engineering, and technology. Harvard Business Review Research Report, 10094, 1-100. Women in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \\"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). \\"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\\". Catalyst. This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued. The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \\"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\\". However, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.(2003). \\"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\\". Catalyst. Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors. These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles. It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles. Stereotyping computer scientists Different forms of media played a part in unconsciously discouraging women from entering the computing field in the late 20th century. Advertisements promoted the idea of the women doing the grunt work in computing while the men oversaw the women's work. For example, men were shown to be using the phone while in front of the computer, while women were using the keyboard to do work on the computer. As women slowly became experts in the field, journalists started writing about the fewer number of men who were experts in the field, while writing pieces about women's lack of expertise, shifting the narrative. Other research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student. Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field. Racial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype. Nonetheless, it has been found that a women‚Äôs race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field. Some cases that subvert the stereotype of typical people in computing include the person coming from a family that is already involved in computing or a related field. Also, coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic status is correlated to a higher likelihood of women choosing computing or a related field. Yet, many computing companies only search for employees from prestigious schools, which leaves fewer opportunities.  Technological Advancements  The ENIAC not only initiated the rapid development of technology, but also the shift of computing work from females to males. Before 1954, MetLife had a large number of women workers in their punch-card division. A majority of women in this division received an annual salary of $3,400 (approximately 55 women) while the highest salary possible was $6,700. After the company converted its punch-card division to a computer division, there were less than 10 women in the division and the highest annual salary possible was $5,400. More men were appointed in the department and the highest salary possible was over $9,000. Many women were assigned to other routine jobs in the department or let go once the transition was made. The women still working after the transition were mostly appointed in data entry. It continued to be a low-paid, difficult, high-pressure, and time-dependent job that required a lot of accuracy because the machines were only as good as its input. This further added to the stress because if the machines gave inaccurate information, it was assumed that the women were making mistakes in the calculations during the input process. Even though the technological advancements continued well towards the 21st century, an advancement in better opportunities and work environments continued to stay the same, discouraging women to enter or continue in the field. Fraternity-like startup environments The disproportionate number of startups in the computing industry, and the disproportionate hiring of primarily young workers, have created an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are recent college graduates, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to sexism that discourages female participation. The phenomenon of fraternity-like environments among technology teams of startup firms has been termed brogrammer culture. Psychological differences between genders Women, on aggregate, prefer people-oriented careers. while their male counterparts show a preference for thing-oriented careers. The difference between male and female interests is larger in gender- egalitarian countries than in non gender-egalitarian countries, which suggests the theory that these differences are due to societal roles isn't entirely explanatory. Other work around this, including discussion of the Gender- equality paradox, has shown that this may be a naive interpretation of results, which instead can be explained by the study's methodological choices and confounding factors. Bringing women into computing Three women repair computers in Lilongwe, Malawi. The majority of data collected about women in IT has been qualitative analysis such as interviews and case studies. This data has been used to create effective programs addressing the underrepresentation of women in IT.Moody, J W; Beise, C M; Woszczynski, A B; Myers, M E. (2003). \\"Diversity and the information technology workforce: Barriers and opportunities\\", p.3. The Journal of Computer Information Systems. Suggestions for incorporating more women in IT careers include formal mentoring, ongoing training opportunities, employee referral bonuses, multicultural training for all IT employees, as well as educational programs targeting women.Ramsey, N.; McCorduck, P. (2005). \\"Where are the women in Information Technology?\\" . Anita Borg Institute. The number of female college entrants expressing interest in majoring in computer science decreased in the 2000s to pre-1980's levels. A research study was initialized by Allan Fisher, then Associate Dean for Undergraduate Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon University, and Jane Margolis, a social scientist and expert in gender equity in education, into the nature of this problem. The main issues discovered in interesting and retaining women in computer science were feelings of an experience gap, confidence doubts, interest in curriculum and pedagogy, and peer culture.Blum, Lenore (2001). \\"Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience\\", Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. Universities across North America are changing their computer science programs to make them more appealing to women. Proactive and positive exposures to early computer experiences, such as The Alice Project,The Alice Project , Carnegie Mellon University. founded by the late Randy Pausch at Carnegie Mellon University, are thought to be effective in terms of retention and creation of enthusiasm for women who may later consider entering the field. Institutions of higher education are also beginning to make changes regarding the process and availability of mentoring to women that are undergraduates in technical fields. Another strategy for addressing this issue has been early outreach to elementary and high-school girls. Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age. A specific example of this kind of program is the Canadian Information Processing Society outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.\\"Women in IT\\", Canada's Association of IT Professionals. Companies like IBM also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13. Additionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career- oriented topics. In the United Kingdom, the British Computer Society (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as BCSWomen, founded by Sue Black, and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science. Twenty-first century effortsNational Center for Women & Information Technology= National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) currently leads the support of women's entry and retention in computing. The National Center for Women & Information Technology aims to help create both academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. In their research, encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They also found women entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement more often than their male counterparts. They conclude that support can allow a woman to believe in her ability to compete in the field of computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing. This program provides girls with encouragement through a network of support and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class. Aspirations in Computing found that creating a sense of belonging or \\"fitting in\\" becomes a fundamental for interest and current retention. The National Center for Women & Information Technology created the Aspirations Award in order to involve women in a national competition. Awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \\"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37. Business Source Premier. Web. 16 Jan 2015. =Academies and organizations= In September 2013, Ada Developers Academy, a tuition-free one year intensive school in software development for women was launched by Technology Alliance in Seattle, and students could even apply to receive a $1000-per-month-stipend. The first half of the course focuses on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and computer science fundamentals. Having started in New York City, Girl Develop It is a network of city chapters that teach women from all parts of the country learn to develop software with HTML and CSS, Javascript, PhP, and other languages and frameworks. The organization was co-founded by Sara Chipps and Vanessa Hurst in 2010. Structural and content resources used to teach the programs have been developed and are offered for free both on their website and on GitHub.com. is an intensive, women-only 10-week programming course in San Francisco. A Moms in Tech sponsorship for Hackbright Academy is also available for mothers who are former IT professionals and wish to retrain and return to work as a technically hands-on lead or manager, sponsored by Facebook. Geek Girl is an organization that was started in March 2006 by Leslie Fishlock. It is an organization that acts as a technology resource for women. The organization strives to empower women of all ages through making technology easy to understand and use. These services are provided entirely by women. Though the target audience tends to be female and the organization was founded on the goal to empower women, men are also encouraged to participate in any of the events or services the organization offers. Geek Girl hosts localized events, meetups, and conferences. The organization also supports a video channel titled GeekGirl TV that provides workshops about technological tools as well as provides coverage for their events for those who are unable to attend. Additionally, Geek Girl's website hosts a blog that provides technology-related news and information that is accessible to a reader with minimal technology experience. Girls Who Code is a nonprofit organization, founded to close the gap of gender within technology. The organization was founded by Reshma Saujani in 2012 in New York City with around 20 girls. As of August 2017, the organization is now in all 50 states with a membership of 40,000 girls. The organization holds programs, like the Summer Immersion Program, where participants are paired with companies within the STEM field. They are able to gain experience and mentorship through the program. Girls Who Code also hold after school programs in all 50 states. A woman and her colleague learn how to code in a coding workshop. Grace Hopper Academy, named after Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, is another woman-only immersive programming school, located in New York City. A partner school to Fullstack Academy, Grace Hopper's curriculum focuses on the MEAN stack, and through education and mentorship, aims to help women begin careers in software engineering. is a non-profit organization that focuses on teaching computer science to young girls in underserved communities. The organization partners with schools and programs to help provide volunteer teachers, computer science course offerings, and computers. The organization was co-founded by Angie Sciavoni and Sep Kamvar in 2010. CodeEd provides courses in HTML and CSS, and provides the curriculum and course material for free under a Creative Commons Attribution license. The organization offers classes that are taught by a team of two volunteer teachers, provide lessons in one-hour blocks that may be dispensed in a way that works for the receiving school, and teachers through fun and experimental projects. Code Ed currently offers services in New York City, Boston, and San Francisco. is an organization that facilitates a community driven to inspire women to take on a role in the computer sciences. The organization was founded at Stanford University by now-alumnae Ellora Israni and Ayna Agarwal, who spearheaded the organization's inaugural conference in April 2012. The conference featured female speakers who held tech positions in companies like Google, Pinterest, and Facebook and was well attended. The conference inspired its organizers to continue with and expand upon she++ and now facilitates participation initiatives through hosting additional events such as a 2013 conference, curating a video library that features inspirational stories from technology professionals, and by offering a mentorship program. The organization is run by a collection of female students and Stanford University. Nerd Girls was launched in 2000 by Karen Panetta, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Tufts University. It is an organization that is represented by a group of female engineering students each year and encourages women to take on roles in the engineering and technology profession. The organization celebrates the coincidence of science knowledge and femininity. Participating members solve real-world problems as a group by addressing and fixing technology related issues in the community. Nerd Girls has gained national attention since its launch and has been approached by media producers to create a reality show based on the organization's problem-solving activities. Nerd Girls is sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Femgineer was started in 2007 by Poornima Vijayashanker. It was originally developed as a blog that focused on engineers, which evolved into an organization that supports women in technology careers. Femgineers is now an education-focused organization that offers workshops, free teaching resources on the topic of technology, supports forums and Meetups, and a team has been developed to continue to expand on the original blog. Poornima Vijayashanker is an avid public speaker and regularly speaks at technology-related conferences and events about the technology industry and about Femgineer itself. In addition to founding Femgineer, she also founded a startup called BizeeBee in 2010 that supports growing fitness businesses, teaches technology workshops for tech-driven organizations around the country, and was named one of the ten women to watch in tech in 2013 by Inc Magazine. Groups such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe propose policies that support gender equality in the work field. One example being the Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality. All OSCE states follow policies to ensure gender equality in all work fields. 2nd OSCE Gender Equality Review Conference =Postsecondary education organization= Numerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of Stanford University, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools. RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization Association of Computing Machinery's committee for women in computing (ACM-W). Harvard University hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC). The organization aims to promote women in computing across a variety of schools and industries, educate women on the profession of computer science, and provide opportunities for women in technical fields. WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science. =Pacesetters= In an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called \\"Pacesetters\\". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \\"Net New Women\\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T;, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters: *Google: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010. *Intel: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training, *Virginia Tech: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs. \\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier. Web. 15 Jan. 2015  Relation to gender theory  There are a number of thinkers who engage with gender theories and issues related to women and technology. Such thinkers include, for example, Donna Haraway, Sadie Plant, Julie Wosk, Sally L. Hacker, Evelyn Fox Keller, Janet Abbate, Thelma Estrin, and Thomas J. Misa, among others. Recoding Gender: Women‚Äôs Changing Participation in Computing, written in 2012 by Janet Abbate, examines the history of programming and how gender bias shifted the demographic of programmers. A 2008 book titled Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership, uses Riane Eisler's cultural transformation theory to offer an interdisciplinary, social systems perspective on issues of access to technology.Kirk, Mary (2008). Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. The book explores how shifting from dominator towards partnership systems‚Äîas reflected in four primary social institutions (communication, media, education, and business) ‚Äî might help society move beyond the simplistic notion of access to co-create a real digital revolution worldwide. A 2000 book titled Athena UnboundEtzkowitz, Henry; Kemelgor, Carol; Uzzi, Brian (2000). Athena Unbound - The advancement of women in science and technology, Cambridge University Press. provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in the sciences from an early childhood interest, through university, to graduate school and finally into the academic workplace. The thesis of this book is that \\"women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist, despite recent advances.\\" Computer scientist Karen Petrie, from University of Dundee, has developed an argument to illustrate why an attack on sexism in computing is not an attack on men. Ian Gent, University of St Andrews, has described this idea which is key to the argument as the \\"Petrie Multiplier.\\" According to J. McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women. A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single, brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts. Cordelia Fine in her book Delusions of Gender argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \\"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\\" Another argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \\"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \\"boy-related\\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.De Palma, Paul. \\"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

The leaves, buds and fruit are covered with a white wax. Description Eucalyptus ceracea is a small tree, often with many stems, or a mallee. It typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The trunk and most of the branches are covered with thick, fibrous or flaky yellowish to reddish brown bark. Young plants, coppice regrowth and the crown of adult trees have egg-shaped, sessile leaves long and wide arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves are dull and glaucous and there are no adult leaves. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven or nine on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and about wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in June and the flowers are bright orange. The fruit is a woody, urn- shaped capsule long, wide and glaucous. The leaves, buds and fruits of the tree are covered with a white wax. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus ceracea was first formally described in 1986 by Ian Brooker and Christopher Done from a specimen found south of the King George Falls in the Kimberley region. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (ceracea ) is derived from the Latin word cereus meaning \\"wax\\" or \\"waxy\\", referring to the waxy covering of the plant. Distribution and habitat The Seppelt Range gum is found in skeletal sandy soils on scree slopes and sandstone ridges in a small area near the coast in the east Kimberley region of Western Australia. Associated species include spinifex (Plectrachne) and trees including Eucalyptus tectifica, E. tetrodonta and Erythrophleum chlorostachys. It is only known from two populations found in the Seppelt Range, north of Wyndham. Both populations are located on land vested in the Aboriginal Land Trust. The number of mature flowering plants is not known but the total area on which they area found is less than .

It landed on D-Day and saw action throughout the campaign in North West Europe, defending the vital port of Antwerp against Parachute mines and V-1 flying bombs. Origin The regiment was formed in January 1942 from the short-lived 91st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery which had only been raised in the previous March as part of the rapid expansion of Britain's Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences.Farndale, Annex M.91 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.114 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. 91st Searchlight Regiment 91st S/L Regiment was formed in 3rd AA Brigade at Belfast in Northern Ireland. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed on 25 March 1941 at 3rd AA Bde's HQ at Orangefield House and began assembling in April at Rathgael House, Bangor, County Down, under the command of Lt-Col Nigel Hoare. It received a draft of newly commissioned officers from 133rd (AA) Officer Cadet Training Unit at Shrivenham, and in the first week of May the batteries (which had all been formed on 16 January) began arriving from various AA training regiments and were deployed to their sites; 552nd S/L Bty deployed directly from 237th S/L Training Rgt at nearby Holywood. The new unit had the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 862, 875.91 S/L Rgt War Diary 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/3111. * 549 S/L Bty, formed by 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle from a cadre of experienced officers and men provided by 49th (The West Yorkshire Regiment) S/L Rgt * 550 S/L Bty, formed by 235th S/L Training Rgt at Ayr, cadre from 38th (The King's Regiment) S/L Rgt * 552 S/L Bty, formed by 237th S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, County Down, cadre from 45th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) S/L Rgt * 553 S/L Bty, formed by 238th S/L Training Rgt at Buxton, cadre from 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's Regiment) S/L Rgt Nigel Walter Hoare (1902‚Äì1988) was a member of the Hoare banking family and had been commissioned into the Essex Group AA Searchlight Companies, Royal Engineers, in the Territorial Army in 1925. Nigel Walter Hoare at The Peerage.Nigel Hoare at Geni UK.Mrs Hoare's obituary.Monthly Army Lists 1925‚Äì39. Belfast was raided several times while the regiment was forming (the Belfast Blitz); thereafter there were only rare incursions by enemy aircraft over Northern Ireland. The searchlights were deployed in clusters, but towards the end of 1941 this arrangement was changed, and the lights in Northern Ireland were redeployed singly to form a 'killer belt' to assist night-fighters.Routledge, p. 399. This system required fewer lights, and in November 1941 Anti-Aircraft Command decided that 91st S/L Rgt would be converted to the Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) gun role. In December the batteries went to Holywood, where they were retrained by what was now 237th LAA Training Rgt, and surplus manpower was drafted to other units.114 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7700. 114th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment Bofors 40 mm LAA gun equipped with 'Stiffkey Stick' sights The official conversion took place on 12 January 1942, when 549, 550, 552 and 553 S/L Btys were redesignated 372, 373, 374 and 375 LAA Btys respectively.Frederick, pp. 805, 838. After attending 17th LAA Practice Camp at Ballykinlar Camp, County Down, the new regiment, still under the command of Lt-Col Hoare, embarked for Fleetwood in Lancashire. Here it deployed to relieve 76th LAA Rgt at sites across Lancashire, with RHQ at Milnthorpe. The regiment was under the command of 70th AA Bde in 4th AA Division, but in May it transferred to 31st (North Midland) AA Bde of 10th AA Division in Yorkshire, with 372 Bty detached to 65th AA Bde covering Humberside. On the night of 29/30 May, assisted by searchlights, A Troop of 372 Bty at Grimsby engaged 13 enemy aircraft, and a detachment of C Trp at a site in Hull also engaged one aircraft.Routledge, p. 306. In July 1942, 114th LAA Rgt provided a cadre of experienced men to form a new 483rd LAA Bty at 212th LAA Training Rgt at Saighton Camp, then on 6 October the whole of 374 LAA Bty left to join a new 142nd LAA Rgt that was being formed nearby at Lotherton Hall. The rest of 114th LAA Rgt's batteries handed their gunsites over to 142nd LAA Rgt and left for battle training. Mobile training In July 1942, 114th had opened a regimental school for mobile LAA operations, but it was hampered by the lack of motor vehicles. In November and December that year the regiment underwent formal mobile training under 11th AA Bde at Leigh-on-Sea. It then moved to South Collingham in Nottinghamshire to take over operational commitments under 50th AA Bde. Crusader AA tank with Bofors gun However, on 12 January 1943, the regiment was instructed to join 75th AA Bde at Ipswich. This was not part of AA Command but one of the mobile formations in Home Forces training for the planned invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord). The regiment began taking part in field training exercises in various parts of the country and was formally mobilised on 30 March. Each battery of a mobile LAA regiment consisted of three Troops equipped with six towed Bofors 40 mm guns using 'Stiffkey Stick' sights. The following month it came under the command of the newly formed 80th AA Brigade at Blandford Camp in Dorset. As a mobile unit, 114th LAA Rgt now had its own Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop, which joined in May 1943.114 LAA Rgt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11734.80 AA Bde War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11248. The regiment established its HQ at Arthurlie Barracks at Barrhead in Scotland in July, to which it returned after periodic training exercises simulating assault landings on a hostile shore. Towards the end of 1943 the regiment moved to join 80th AA Bde HQ at Oxted and Limpsfield in Surrey. In December 1943‚ÄìJanuary 1944 it carried out user trials at No 16 AA Practice Camp at Clacton-on-Sea on self-propelled (SP) Bofors 40 mm guns mounted on Crusader tank chassis. In February 1944 it began to receive this new equipment.114 LAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1132. By now, 80th AA Bde HQ and 114th LAA Rgt had moved to Southampton, and in April the regiment moved again to Stroud Park at Broadbridge Heath in West Sussex before going to its invasion marshalling areas in late May.80 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. D-Day For the Normandy landings, 80th AA Brigade was assigned to support I Corps landing on Juno and Sword Beaches, while 76th AA Brigade supported XXX Corps on Gold Beach. The leading elements were to land with the assault waves on D-Day itself (6 June). Light AA defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat. The LAA regiments involved in the initial landings were on minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties arriving later.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì8. The leading units were formed into AA Assault Groups, and Lt-Col Hoare with RHQ of 114th LAA Rgt took charge of 'O' AA Assault Group landing on Mike Sector of Juno Beach under the command of 3rd Canadian Division. The Crusader-mounted guns would each tow a conventional Bofors gun ashore. The assault group also included elements of 93rd LAA Rgt equipped with the new 20 mm Polsten gun in triple mountings on Crusader tank chassis towing equipment trailers, and part of 86th (Honourable Artillery Company) Heavy AA Rgt equipped with towed 3.7-inch guns:Joslen, p. 583.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.

Between them, the two batteries of 114th LAA Rgt deployed 30 Bofors guns (of which 12 were SP tracked) on Juno beach. Meanwhile, 373/114 Bty and C Trp 372/114 Bty (24 SP Bofors) were assigned to 76th AA Bde landing at Gold Beach The AA units at Juno experienced serious problems on 6 June, with heavy losses in landing craft on the run in, and landing while hard fire-fights were continuing to establish a firm beachhead. Batteries were badly split up, some detachments being separated from their guns.Routledge, pp. 308‚Äì10. The reconnaissance party of 114th LAA's H Trp landed in Nan Red Sector about 09.00 when the beach was still under heavy mortar fire and cross machine gun fire. A G Troop gun tractor received a direct hit from a mortar and was burnt out. The party gathered under the cliff and decided that it was impossible to land the guns. Lance-Bombardier \\"Jock\\" Alexander Wentworth volunteered to report the situation to the battery commander on Nan White beach. This entailed a journey of 1() miles along the enemy-held shore, which was mined and under fire, and he had to wade part of the way. Having reported to 375 LAA Bty HQ, he then returned under fire with orders to bring H troop round to Nan White where the guns were successfully landed. Wentworth was awarded a Military Medal (MM) for this exploit.Wentworth's citation in TNA file WO 373/49/266. There were greater delays at Mike sector; the guns of B Trp landed at 16.15 and went into action on the beach because the dunes and approaches were mined. Their crews helped to rescue men from burning landing craft at the edge of the water. A Troop's guns were in the process of landing at 19.00 when they engaged a Junkers Ju 88 attacking the landing craft ‚Äì the only daylight attack on Juno during D-Day. RHQ reported 24 Bofors and 12 x 20 mm of 'O' AA Assault Group ashore by 19.00. In the absence of HAA guns and their radar or of searchlights, which had been unable to land, uncontrolled barrages by the LAA guns were all that was possible during the night, but no concentrated attack occurred. Additional Troops of 114th LAA Rgt landed on D+1 as air attacks began to increase, peaking on D+3. The Medical Officer (MO) of 114th LAA Rgt, Captain John Wormald, Royal Army Medical Corps, was one of the first MOs to land in Mike Sector on D-Day. He treated casualties on the beach for 48 hours continuously, often under fire, and was the first to take help to a gun crew that took a direct hit next to his dressing station. After two days he moved to a Field Dressing Station where he worked 16‚Äì20 hours a day for three weeks, treating military and civilian casualties. Wormald was afterwards awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt Star.Wormald's citation in TNA file WO 373/186/1228. Once ashore the AA Assault Groups reorganised into regimental groups, with regimental commanders acting as AA Defence Commanders (AADCs) in their immediate areas. Lieutenant-Colonel Hoare's command was as follows:Hoare's citation in TNA file WO 373/186/1092. 114 LAA Regimental Group * All units 114th LAA Rgt except 373 Bty and C/372 Trp * 321/93 LAA Bty * 112 Pioneer Company less detachments * Detachment 63/20 LAA Bty manning Bofors and 20 mm guns on 'Gooseberry' blockships sunk off the beach as breakwaters * B/139 LAA Rgt manning Bofors on five AA Barges lying off the beach At 02.30 on 9 June (D+4), an enemy aircraft dropped a number of anti-personnel bombs on a Bofors site of G Trp at the junction of Nan White and Green beaches. The first bomb severely wounded the gun's No 2 while the No 4, Gunner Douglas Taylor, was hit in the leg, though the crew continued to engage the aircraft until it had passed. A second bomb had ignited an ammunition dump a few yards away and while the No 2's wound was being attended to, Taylor led two other men to tackle the blaze, ignoring his own wound and the danger from the exploding ammunition. He was later relieved by the gun's No 1 and taken to a beach dressing station, from which he was evacuated to England the same day. Taylor was awarded the MM.Taylor 's citation in TNA file WO 373/49/278. The night of 15/16 June provided 'the best shoot so far' according to the regimental war diary. The searchlights came into their own and four aircraft were shot down in I Corps sector, though it was impossible to say which batteries actually hit them. Normandy Bofors gun and crew, summer 1944 As the build-up in the Normandy beachhead grew during June and July 1944, 80th AA Bde was tasked with protecting Juno and Sword beaches, the small port of Ouistreham, and the River Orne and Caen Canal bridges.Routledge, p. 308; Table XLIX, p. 319. 114th LAA Rgt established RHQ at Courseulles, with part of the regiment astride the Orne and the canal. On 16 June it was ordered to send a Troop to Douvres to catch aircraft attempting to drop supplies to the German troops holding out in the strongpoint there (the Battle of Douvres Radar Station), and on 20 June it was ordered to deploy a roving Troop to protect an important ammunition ship unloading at Ouistreham. When some of the parties of 6/20 LAA Bty were washed off their Gooseberries during the great storm of June, they were distributed to 114th LAA Rgt to ease manning problems. Although Luftwaffe attacks over the beachhead were generally sporadic, they concentrated on the bridges, while Sword Beach and the whole Eastern Sector remained under mortar and artillery fire. At the end of July, 114th LAA Rgt reported that it was being attacked by a 'secret weapon', which destroyed 372 Bty's HQ, killing a sentry. Upon investigation it appeared that it was being shelled by a large calibre gun from long range. On 13 August 373 Bty finally returned to the regiment from 76th AA Bde. At the end of August, 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. Reverting to a mobile role, and supported by the 30 three-tonner trucks of 1587 Platoon, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), 114th LAA Rgt came under the command of the newly arrived 74th AA Bde supporting First Canadian Army. The regiment was amongst the first troops to enter Rouen behind the assaulting Canadian infantry on 30 August. Here it was deployed to protect the crossings of the River Seine. It was withdrawn on 10 September and moved to Dieppe, arriving on 12 September when it reverted to 80 AA Bde command. There were no air raids, but the regiment captured a number of German soldiers, who joined the large numbers in the prisoner-of-war (POW) camp. The regiment was required to act as an infantry cordon in the event of a break-out attempt from the POW camp.Routledge, p. 314; Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì9. Lieutenant-Colonel Hoare was later awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Palm for his work on D-Day and during the Normandy campaign. Antwerp V-1 in flight over Antwerp Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. Clearing the Scheldt Estuary and bringing the port of Antwerp into use as a supply base was an important element in the Overlord plan. The planners envisaged a large AA Gun Defence Area (GDA) to deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers').Routledge, pp. 322, 333. 114th LAA Rgt was equipped with the Vickers No 1 AA Predictor (normally used by 3.7-inch HAA batteries) to tackle these small fast-moving targets and on 18 October it arrived at Antwerp to reinforce 5th Royal Marine AA Bde. At first it was deployed along the tops of dykes to guard against German aircraft laying mines in the Scheldt Estuary: the regiment suggested that it would be better to place the guns on Rhine barges (F Troop finally embarked on barges in mid-January). The first 'Diver' arrived in the Antwerp area on 23 October, and the regiment suffered a few casualties, including a fatality when a cinema in the city was hit.114 LAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4958.Routledge, Table LII, p. 331; pp. 334‚Äì5. To prevent V-1s falling in the city and dock area, the guns had to be positioned at least 10 miles outside the city, integrated into a system ('Antwerp X') of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. 114th LAA Regiment provided some of the personnel and equipment for No 2 Local Warning (Radar) Troop formed by 80 AA Bde for this purpose. The Antwerp X deployment, including 114th LAA Rgt, took its full form in December 1944, in time for the peak in V-1 attacks that lasted into February 1945. In mid-January, 114th LAA Rgt redeployed some of its guns for AA rather than anti-minelaying duties. Conventional air attacks were rare, except on 1 January 1945, when the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte against Allied airfields on support of the Ardennes offensive, and German aircraft approaching the city were heavily engaged by the AA guns.Routledge, pp. 336‚Äì7; Table LIII, p. 342. Disbandment As the Allied forces advanced into Germany the air threat dwindled. The last V-1 landed at Antwerp on 29 March,80 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4893. and by late April 1945, a number of AA units were deemed surplus to requirements. 114th LAA Rgt was ordered to cease fire on 17 April, and its REME and RASC detachments were withdrawn. It then reverted to the command of 76th AA Bde and began to hand in its guns and transport. The final order to disband arrived on 8 May (VE Day), and this was completed on 16 June.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889.

Political career O'Sullivan is a career politician and political staffer who started his career as an adviser to former Nationals Senator Julian McGauran and who later served as state director of the National Party from 2005 to 2010. He was also briefly employed as a lobbyist for the alcohol and gambling industries.https://au.linkedin.com/in/luke-o- sullivan-77b24a48 At the time of his preselection was chief of staff to state Nationals leader Peter Walsh. Walsh pointedly chastised O'Sullivan for residing in Melbourne at the time he ran for pre-selection, but O'Sullivan promised to relocate to Northern Victoria if he were successful. O'Sullivan succeeded at his second pre-selection attempt, having been defeated by Bridget McKenzie for Senate pre-selection in 2009. O'Sullivan's appointment was delayed after the Victorian Government refused a joint sitting to appoint him in retaliation for the Legislative Council's vote to suspend Special Minister of State Gavin Jennings from the chamber for six months. During his brief parliamentary career, O'Sullivan notably voted against the legalisation of euthanasiahttp://hansard.parliament.vic.gov.au/isysquery/fe138cd4-762b-4fca-8760-5c1beed6f5f8/1/doc/ and the introduction of a treaty between Victoria and the indigenous community.http://hansard.parliament.vic.gov.au/isysquery/bf241602-7377-4c42-9a11-59ee4599ecc7/52/doc/ Prior to the 2018 state election, O'Sullivan observed that there was a lack of high calibre candidates nominating for regional seats. Despite facing what he had labelled low-calibre opposition, O'Sullivan failed to win election and consequently left the Nationals without upper house representation from Northern Victoria for the first time in the party's history. After his surprising failure to win election, O'Sullivan was hired by Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack as a senior adviser based in Canberra.

Her most notable work is L'Enfant terrible, an animated short based on African myths. She has also produced several documentaries, often focusing on the issues of women and children in Mali. Personal history Konat√© was born in Bamako, Mali. Her family, the Konates, were royalty that had once belonged to the Gbara of Old Mali. She was educated at Cheikh Anta Diop University. Film career After leaving university, Konat√© worked as a member of the crew on Souleymane Ciss√©'s 1985 classic film Yeelen. In 1989 she wrote the screenplay for the short animated film La Geste de S√©gou, directed by fellow Malian Mambaye Coulibaly. Her first credited solo work is listed as the documentary Des Yeux Pour Pleurer (Crying Eyes), shot on video in 1992. Konat√© followed this with a second documentary, also shot on video, Circulation Routiere (Traffic), co- directed with Kabide Djedje. In 1993 she produced three short films, the most notable of which was L'Enfant terrible (The Terrible Child), co-produced with the Belgian workshop Graphoui. L'Enfant terrible, which is based upon a Central African myth, is, like La Geste de S√©gou, an animated story that used puppets. It follows a benevolent spirit, a child which is born with teeth and the ability to talk and walk, who finds its older brother and begins an unusual journey. It remains her most highly acclaimed work. Konat√© followed her short films by returning to documentaries, releasing Femmes et D√©veloppement in 1995. Femmes et D√©veloppement makes comparison between women in Mali from different socioeconomic groups. The film looks at what has been accomplished by women in her country and what still needs to be accomplished. In 1998 she directed Un mineur en milieu carc√©ral, a short documentary which explored the plight of children who have been incarcerated, often for minor offenses. Her 2008 documentary Daman Da (Yellow Mirage), follows the day-to- day lives of gold miners in Mali. She was drawn to the topic after watching a local news report on the subject. The film showed the difficulties faced by the miners, working in crude conditions, but also the honesty and work ethic they displayed.

As a cameraman and director of productions at Edison's first studio, he was the first to make moving pictures with innovations like continuity, plot, trained actors and special effects. In 1896, he joined Emile Berliner's Gramophone Company and then went to Europe where he became an important manager of companies like HMV and EMI. He was naturalized as a British citizen in 1928 and he became a leading member of the Oriental Ceramic Society in London, establishing a valuable collection including rare pieces which had been made for the emperors of the Tang and Song dynasty. In 1921 he married Ivy Sanders, who survived him and died in 1973.British Museum Early life Alfred Clark was born in New York on 19 December 1876. He was educated at the Franklin School in Washington and the City College of New York. He took an early interest in electricity and left college at sixteen to join the North American Phonograph Company. This collapsed in 1894 and Clark then joined Thomas Edison to make early short movies using the Kinetoscope technology at the Black Maria studio. Previously, Edison's output had been boxing and vaudeville but Clark introduced the first productions with continuity and plot such as the brief Execution of Mary Stuart which introduced the first special effect to show her decapitation. Gramophone Letter of introduction given to Clark by Edison to help him get established in Europe Clark's main interest was sound recording so, after a year of pioneering cinema, he worked for Edison's phonograph company while taking evening classes at the Cooper Institute and collaborating with Emile Berliner and Eldridge Johnson on development of the gramophone ‚Äì a superior technology to the phonograph, as it enabled mass production of recordings from a metal master. Clark's innovations included a governor to control the speed of playback and an improved sound box. In 1899, Clark went to France, representing both Edison and Berliner. The gramophone technology did well, and Clark founded the Compagnie de Gramophone Fran√ßaise which recorded major artists such as Claude Debussy and Edvard Grieg. In 1904, Clark sold his French holdings for ¬£23,000 and, in 1907, he helped establish the Mus√©e de la Voix for which he was awarded the Legion of Honour. In 1908, he moved to Britain where he became the managing director of the Gramophone company there, reorganising it and establishing a factory in Hayes. The First World War was disruptive as the business had to focus on war work but Clark gained greater control of the company. After the war, he developed the partnership with Eldridge Johnson's Victor Talking Machine Company and acquired the Marconiphone business for its new technologies of radio and electronics, which were now becoming important for home entertainment. In 1931, the business was merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company to form EMI. This focussed on cost-cutting and rationalisation to survive the Great Depression but continued to develop its technology, including television which the BBC started broadcasting using an EMI system in 1936. The second world war interrupted such consumer developments as the business again had to switch to war work such as radar. Clark was the chairman and sometimes managing director during this period and he then retired in 1946. Chinese ceramics Clark formed one of the most important Western collections of Chinese ceramics (though it was outshone by that of Sir Percival David). His first donation to the British Museum was a Ru ware brush-washer bowl in 1936; this was lent to an exhibition in the Palace Museum in Beijing in 2015‚Äì16.British Museum; the dish This was one of a pair; the other was later sold to a Japanese collection.

Argentina gained recognition in 1965, when the team toured South Africa playing a series of friendly matches there. In that tour the national team was nicknamed Los Pumas, a name that became an identity mark for Argentina, remaining to present days. Argentina has taken part in all the Rugby World Cups since the first edition in 1987, being their best performance the 3rd. place achieved in 2007. The national side also plays the Rugby Championship since the 2012 edition, after joining the competition one year before.Argentina is now part of Rugby Championship by Frankie Deges, The Buenos Aires Herald, 23 Nov 2011 Background Rosario A.C. squad of 1884, the oldest photo of a rugby team in Argentina. At the middle of the 19th century the Irish immigrants in Argentina introduced sports and contributed to establish clubs in the country, although the first clubs in Argentina only admitted English members. Natives were rarely accepted, most of the cases as an exception. The first rugby union match in Argentina was played in 1873, in the Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground, located in Palermo, Buenos Aires. Both teams were formed by members of the BACC and they play a mix between football and rugby.Or√≠genes de los deportes brit√°nicos en el R√≠o de La Plata, Buenos Aires, 1932 On 29 June 1886, it is recorded that Buenos Aires F.C. (predecessor of current Buenos Aires Cricket & Rugby Club) and Rosario A.C. played the first inter-clubs match in Plaza Jewell, Rosario, Santa Fe.The Complete Book of Rugby by Richard Bath (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997. )\\"Rugby: A 123 a√±os del primer partido en la Argentina\\", Atl√©tico del Rosario website, 28 Jun 2009 In 1899, four clubs in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, joined together to form the River Plate Rugby Football Union and organised the first club championship that same year.  1910‚Äì1936: From the first matches to World War I  In 1910 a side managed by Oxford University ‚Äìsupposedly the England national team, but including three Scottish players‚Äî toured Argentina as part of the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the May Revolution. The people of Argentina termed it the \\"Combined British\\", also known as \\"Great Britain XV\\". Argentina made its international debut against this team under the name \\"The River Plate Rugby Football Union\\" on 12 June. The match was played at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina of Palermo and Argentina lost 28‚Äì3. The only try for the Argentine squad (the first international try) was scored by Buenos Aires F.C. player Frank Heriot. The Argentina line-up was: J.E. Saffey; C. McCarthy, Oswald Gebbie (cap), F.

Of the nine encounters, four tests were played, which Argentina lost by over 30 points in all. All the games took place in Buenos Aires. The important fact was that all the players on the field were Argentine-born. Reginald Cooper, former team captain in 1928 1927 also saw the first time Argentina wore the traditional light blue and white jersey, after a proposal from Mr. Abelardo Guti√©rrez of Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires. That request was accepted and Argentina wore the striped uniform v. the British Lions.\\"La pasi√≥n cumple 100 a√±os\\", La Naci√≥n, 10 April 1999 Five years passed until another international team would return to Argentina, which would be the Junior Springboks which arrived in the country for the first time in 1932 to play a series of friendly matches v. local clubs and combined teams.Pumas and Juniors Springboks, RuggaWorld, 10 Dec 2005 On July 16 and 23 the JS played Argentina, winning both matches, 42‚Äì0 and 34‚Äì3, respectively.

Only one test was played on the tour, with Argentina losing 23‚Äì0. The following month Argentina left the country to play their first away tests ‚Äì against Chile in Valpara√≠so. Argentina won the first test (and their first game), 29‚Äì0. The second match was won by a similar margin. Two years later Argentina hosted Chile, which resulted in Argentina winning by 30 points.

Argentina lost the match by 8‚Äì22. On September 12, both teams played a second test match at the same venue, with another victory for France which won by 30‚Äì3.\\"Gira de Francia por Argentina\\" at UAR website At the second South American tournament, in 1958, Argentina accounted for Uruguay 50‚Äì3 and Peru 44‚Äì0, and finally Argentina emerged victorious against the hosts Chile in Santiago, by 14‚Äì0 to win their second title. In 1959 the Junior Springboks returned to South America to play a series of friendly matches in Buenos Aires and Rosario against local clubs and combined teams. The South African played Argentina in two test-matches at GEBA, winning both fixtures 14‚Äì6, and 20‚Äì5. The JS played a total of 15 matches in Argentina, winning all of them. The third edition of the South American competition, in 1961 held in Uruguay found Argentina to win their third consecutive title after defeating Chile (11‚Äì3), Brazil (thrashing them by 60‚Äì0) and local team Uruguay by 36‚Äì3, with all the matches being played at Carrasco Polo of Montevideo. Argentina won their four South American title in 1964 with victories over Uruguay (25‚Äì6), Brazil and Chile (both with the same score, 30‚Äì8). 1960s: The birth of Los Pumas In 1960, France visited Argentina and Uruguay for a series of 13 matches, 3 of them against Argentina. The hosts still could not get their first win over the French, with France winning all three tests 37‚Äì3, 12‚Äì3 and 29‚Äì6, all of them played at Estadio G.E.B.A..

In 1964 a new version of the South American tournament was played in San Pablo and Argentina again achieved huge victories over Uruguay (25‚Äì6), Brazil (30‚Äì5) and Chile (30‚Äì8). In the late 1960s the four home unions began tours to Argentina, and after Wales struggled in both tests in Buenos Aires in 1967 it became clear that Argentina would be a difficult place to win a series. Scotland lost the first test in 1968, but won a close second test two weeks later. Marcelo Pascual diving in the ingoal of Junior Springboks on June 19, 1965, during the tour on South Africa. That match is considered the beginning of a new era for the national rugby team. The first trip of the Argentina national rugby team to the other side of the Atlantic was to Rhodesia and South Africa in 1965. The team acquired the nickname Pumas, from a local journalist of The Weekly Farers after their first tour match, a defeat on 8 May by Rhodesia in Salisbury 17‚Äì12. The journalist mistook the animal that appeared on the UAR emblem (a yaguaret√©) for a puma, probably because it was an unknown species in South Africa. Nevertheless, the nickname has remained as a mark of identity for the team since then.¬øPor qu√© Los Pumas? by Mariana Chapotot, Infobae.com, 4 Dec 2012La historia de los apodos de los equipos de rugby, La Vanguardia, 28 Oct 2015 After defeats by Salisbury and Northern Transvaal, the first win came against Western Transvaal, another against South West Africa Country Districts and finally against the Southern Universities. The Pumas scored a landmark win of 11‚Äì6 against the Junior Springboks on June 19 at Ellis Park Stadium. The line-up for that historic day was Roberto Cazenave; Enrico Neri, Marcelo Pascual, Arturo Rodr√≠guez Jurado (h), Eduardo Espa√±a; Eduardo Poggi, Adolfo Etchegaray; Ra√∫l Loyola, H√©ctor Silva, Eduardo Scharenberg; Rodolfo Schmidt, Aitor Ota√±o (c); Ronnie Foster, Nicanor Gonz√°lez del Solar, Luis Garc√≠a Y√°√±ez. That victory over the Junior Springboks was widely praised by the media, being considered as the first landmark of the Argentine rugby since the beginning of this sport in the country.El d√≠a que nacieron Los Pumas, El Gr√°fico Argentina played a total of 16 matches, with 11 won and only 4 lost over two months. The players were welcomed home to Buenos Aires by a huge crowd. A match was then organised against the French champions Section Paloise, although the match was remembered for the uproar and misconduct of both teams rather than the Argentine victory. Then Oxford & Cambridge arrived, a team that the Pumas had never beaten. The first match finished level at 19‚Äì19 and the second saw the University students triumph 9‚Äì3. 1965 ended with a match against Chile, which the Pumas won 23‚Äì11. In 1966, the Gazelles ‚Äìa kind of a Junior Springboks B team‚Äì arrived in Argentina. The visitors took two victories 9‚Äì3 and 20‚Äì15. In September 1967, Argentina played in Buenos Aires in the South American Championship with victories over Uruguay 38‚Äì6 and Chile 18‚Äì0. Wales arrived in Buenos Aires in 1968 and for the first time in their history the Pumas were able to triumph in a series, winning the first match 9‚Äì5 and drawing the second 9‚Äì9. The first great decade in Argentine rugby came to a close with the arrival of Scotland in 1969. The first match saw a big Argentine victory 20‚Äì3, but in the second game the visitors narrowly won 6‚Äì3. In 1968 Wales toured on Argentina to play six games. Argentina defeated Wales in the first test by 9‚Äì6, with the following line-up: 15.Jorge Seaton, 14.Mario Walther, 13.Arturo Rodriguez Jurado, 12.Marcelo Pascual, 11.Alejandro Travaglini, 10.Jorge Dartiguelongue, 9.Adolfo Etchegaray, 7.Miguel Chesta, 8.

The 1970s: multiple tours  The forward line of 1970: Garc√≠a Y√°√±ez, Handley and Foster Through the 1970s, Argentina confirmed its steady rise towards top-tier status under the influence of its first truly world-class player, fly-half Hugo Porta. In 1971 Argentina made a second tour on South Africa that included a series of 14 matches played in June and July. The \\"Pumas\\" didn't play against Springboks (playing meanwhile in Australia, but againnts the Gazelles, the selection of emerging under-23 players). Originally was scheduled also a match in Rhodesia, but it was cancelled after a prohibition of Argentine government. Argentina won 9 games, being defeated 4 times. The line-up v. the Gazelles was D. Morgan; M. Pascual, R. Matarazzo, A. Rodr√≠guez Jurado (h), A. Travaglini; R. Espagnol, G. Blaksley; H. Silva (c), J. Wittman, N. Carbone; B. Ota√±o, A. Anthony; R. Foster, R. Handley, L. Garc√≠a Y√°√±ez.Memorias 1971 on UAR website Two years later Los Pumas went on a tour to Ireland and Scotland, playing 8 matches in October and November. Argentina won only two games, losing four with two draws. In the matches v. national sides, Argentina lost to Ireland by 21‚Äì8 on November 10. The other game vs a national team was v. Scotland, 14 days later, which Argentina lost by 12‚Äì11. The second Argentine tour on Europe came in 1975 when the team played seven matches in France during October. Argentina won 3 matches, with 4 losses, two of them vs. the France national team (29‚Äì6 and 36‚Äì21).Memoria temporada 1975 at UAR website One year later Argentina went on a tour around Wales and England to play 6 matches. During their tour, the Pumas came tantalizingly close to a historic victory at Cardiff Arms Park over Wales, then the dominant force in the Northern Hemisphere. Only a Phil Bennett penalty on a foul by Gabriel Travaglini at the death allowed the Welsh to escape with a 20‚Äì19 victory. The line-up for Argentina v. Wales was Martin Sansot; Daniel Beccar Varela, Alejandro Travaglini, Gonzalo Beccar Varela, Jorge Gauweloose; Hugo Porta, Adolfo Etchegaray (C); Jorge Carracedo, Ricardo Mastai, Carlos Neyra; Jos√© Fern√°ndez, Eliseo Branca; Rito Iraneta, Jose Costante, Fernando Ins√∫a.

The team held a virtually full-strength England XV to a 13‚Äì13 draw, before losing 6‚Äì19 to Italy in the first test match between them. Argentine also played the Wales B team, being beat by 17‚Äì14. The tour captain, Hugo Porta, played all nine games, scored 94 of the team's 157 points on tour and established himself as one of the world's great players on the tour.Rothmans Rugby Yearbook 1979‚Äì1980 ‚Äì Queen Anne Press. pp. 47‚Äì51. The last tour of the Argentine side was in 1979 when the team trip to New Zealand to play a series of nine games. Argentina won 6 of them, losing 3 games. On September 18, Argentina played the All Blacks for the first time in their history. The match, held at Carisbrook, was won by New Zealand by 18‚Äì9.

The second test-match, played one week later, ended in a new victory for New Zealand by 15‚Äì6. That same year, the Australian side toured on Argentina by the first time. During October and November, Australia played a series of seven games. In the first test match, Argentina defeated Australia by 24‚Äì13 on October 27 at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium. In the second game (played on November 3) Argentina was defeated by 17‚Äì12.Memorias 1979 at UAR website  1980s: the relevance  During the 1980s, several teams toured on South America also reaching Argentina. This allowed the Pumas to face some of the most important sides of the world, such as England, France, New Zealand and Australia national rugby union team. From the late seventies to the early nineties, Argentina never lost the two matches of a series held in Buenos Aires. Hugo Porta played 19 years for the Pumas, scoring 590 points. After the British Lions visits in 1909 and 1927, the England national team arrived in Argentina for the first time in 1981. The English side played seven matches in the country, with Argentina achieving a 19‚Äì19 tie at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium on May 31. Six days later, England won the second test by 12‚Äì6.Memorias 1981 at UAR website In 1985 France toured on South America, playing a series of 7 matches in Argentina. The national side achieved its first victory over a French national team, a 24‚Äì16 on 22 June at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium. The line-up was: B. Miguens; J.

That same year, Los Pumas played the All Blacks, which were in a tour on the country to play a series of matches in October and November. Argentina lost the first match by 33‚Äì20. Nevertheless, the national side achieved a historic 21‚Äì21 tie on November 2 at Ferro C. Oeste, with all points converted by Hugo Porta.

Argentina lost the first test by 15‚Äì18 and won the second, played on June 25, by 18‚Äì6. The line- up was A. Scolni; D. Cuesta Silva, Loffreda, Turnes, Mendy; R. Madero, Baetti; Allen (c), Milano, Garret√≥n; Iachetti, Branca; Cash, Courreges, Dengra. Both games played at V√©lez Sarsfield.  1990s: process of transition  Over the following years, the retirement of many of Argentina's most experienced players, and the defection of many others to professional leagues (UAR's regulations of the time prevented any player who played professionally from playing for the national team) left Argentina with an inexperienced side. This led to disappointing performances in the 1991 and 1995 World Cups, although in the latter Argentina presented a powerful pack which was praised by the international media. Argentina's tighthead prop, Patricio Noriega and hooker, Federico M√©ndez, went to play in Australia and South Africa respectively after their performance. Noriega even played for the Wallabies. The Pumas toured the British Isles in 1990, playing their first away match versus the England senior team and their first ever test-matches versus the Ireland and Scotland senior squads. Despite Argentina had a two-point loss to Ireland hand (20‚Äì18), the squad was smashed by England (51‚Äì0) and Scotland (49‚Äì3). In 1991 the All Blacks returned to Argentina. The national team was defeated in both tests, 28‚Äì14 and 36‚Äì6, at V√©lez S√°rsfield. Argentina went on a new tour on Europe in 1992, where the team defeated Spain, Romania and France (24‚Äì22). Two years later Argentina toured South Africa to play six matches, losing both tests to the Springboks (42‚Äì22 and 46‚Äì26). The 1995 tour on Australia continued with poor results, losing to the national side (53‚Äì7 and 30‚Äì13). In 1996 Argentina went to England, losing 20‚Äì18 at Twickenham. The 1997 tour on New Zealand found Argentina being hardly defeated by the All Blacks (93‚Äì8 ‚Äìthe biggest defeat in the team's history‚Äì and 62‚Äì10). One year later Argentina would be beat by Japan, Italy, France and Wales in the same tour. The only positive result for the national side was a 31‚Äì22 victory over 1999 Five Nations Championship Scotland on August 21 at the Murrayfield Stadium, during the 1999 tour on the British Isles. A more experienced and somewhat under-rated squad made it to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time. In the WC, Argentina lost the first game to Wales (23‚Äì18), then defeating Samoa (32‚Äì16) and Japan (33‚Äì12), finishing second in their group to Wales, and went onto the quarter-final play-offs. After a vibrant 28‚Äì24 win against Ireland, the Pumas were eliminated by France, 28‚Äì47, in the quarter-final. Gonzalo Quesada was the highest overall points scorer in the tournament with 102. The outstanding performance by Quesada earned him to win the Olimpia de Oro (Golden Olimpia), the top sports award of Argentina.Pol√©micas y curiosidades m√°s recordadas en la historia del Olimpia de Oro, La Naci√≥n, 18 Dec 2013 The new millennium Agust√≠n Pichot stayed in Los Pumas from 1995‚Äì2007, having played four World Cups. In April 2000, Marcelo Loffreda was appointed coach of Argentina. Argentina participated in the 2003 World Cup, but missed out on progressing to the quarter-finals due to a 15‚Äì16 loss to Ireland. Because of the fixture list, Argentina had to play four games in a fortnight, whereas Ireland played the same number of games in four weeks. In 2004 Argentina showed good form, splitting a midyear two-test home series with Wales. Los Pumas handed defending Six Nations champion France a 24‚Äì14 loss in November 2004 at Marseille, before losing 21‚Äì19 to Ireland on a last-minute drop goal. After returning to Argentina, the Pumas lost 39‚Äì7 to the visiting Springboks; however, the Pumas were without 10 regular starters who had returned to their club teams in Europe. The Pumas during their November 2006 win over England at Twickenham. Perhaps one of the Pumas' best matches of the decade came on 23 May 2005, when they played the British and Irish Lions in Cardiff before the Lions' tour to New Zealand. The Pumas chose a side of second- and third-choice players as 25 players were unavailable due to club commitments. An inspired Pumas performance, combined with lacklustre play by a mostly second-choice Lions side, put Argentina on the verge of a great upset until a Jonny Wilkinson penalty at the death salvaged a 25‚Äì25 draw and the Lions avoided a humiliating defeat. When the Springboks returned to Argentina in November of that year at V√©lez S√°rsfield, they faced a much stronger Pumas side, with most of their European-based players present. The Pumas took a 20‚Äì16 lead into the half-time break, before fading the second half and losing 34‚Äì23. The following week, the Pumas defeated Scotland 23‚Äì19 Murrayfield for the Pumas fifth consecutive win over Scotland since 1990. In the 2006 mid-year tests, Argentina swept Wales in a two-test tour for their first test series win over Wales. Argentina won the first test 27‚Äì25, in the first Argentina test in Patagonia. The second test at V√©lez S√°rsfield saw the Pumas win 45‚Äì27, Argentina's largest win ever over Wales. Los Pumas next hosted the All Blacks at V√©lez S√°rsfield. The All Blacks survived a Pumas assault in the final minutes to hang on to win 25‚Äì19 and to deny Argentina a huge upset. Argentina then defeated Chile 60‚Äì13 in Santiago and defeated Uruguay 26‚Äì0 at home to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The 2006 end-of-year Tests began with a bang for Los Pumas, as they handed a 25‚Äì18 defeat at Twickenham, resulting in the fans booing the England team off the pitch. Further success followed for the Pumas, defeating Italy in Rome, and coming within one point of beating France in Paris. The Sunday Times of London reported in February 2007 that the IRB was brokering a deal with SANZAR, the body that organises the Tri Nations, to admit Los Pumas to the competition. However, The Sunday Times indicated that one of the biggest stumbling blocks was the UAR's commitment to amateurism. By August of that year, it became clear that the competition would not be expanded until the key SANZAR media contract with News Corporation expired in 2010. An IRB spokesman noted the contract, Southern Hemisphere fixture congestion, and the lack of a professional structure in Argentina as reasons that Los Pumas could not be admitted any sooner. 2007 World Cup semifinal Ignacio Corleto, on his way to score a try against France at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Los Pumas began their final preparation for the 2007 Rugby World Cup with a summer two-test series against visiting Ireland, with a 22‚Äì20 win at Santa Fe, and a 16‚Äì0 win at V√©lez S√°rsfield. Los Pumas then completed a clean sweep of their mid-year tests with a 24‚Äì6 win over in Mendoza. They split their final warmup tests, defeating 70‚Äì14 at CASI in Buenos Aires, before losing to Wales 20‚Äì27 at Millennium Stadium. Argentina against Ireland during the 2007 Rugby World Cup held in France. At the World Cup, Los Pumas were drawn into the so-called pool of death, featuring two other teams ranked in the top six in the IRB rankings‚ÄîIreland and the hosts France. On top of this, they opened the World Cup at Stade de France against the French, marking the third consecutive World Cup in which they played against the host nation in the World Cup opener. The Pumas took a 17‚Äì9 lead into the half, and held on for a surprising 17‚Äì12 win. The Pumas subsequently beat Georgia 33‚Äì3 at the Stade de Gerland, Lyon. Argentina then beat Namibia 63‚Äì3 in Marseille, the biggest winning margin in Argentine World Cup history. They then secured a 30‚Äì15 victory against Ireland, which ensured that Argentina topped the group. Argentina then defeated Scotland 19‚Äì13 in the quarter-final at the Stade de France. The Pumas' improbable run towards the Webb Ellis trophy ended in a comprehensive 37‚Äì13 defeat by the Springboks in the semi-final at Stade de France. However, the Pumas recovered to beat France for the second time in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, a 34‚Äì10 win in the 3rd/4th place playoff. The 3rd place showing for the Pumas in the 2007 Rugby World Cup was Argentina's best ever result in Rugby World Cup history. Argentina's performance marked the first time that a team from outside the Six Nations or Tri Nations competition reached the semifinals of the Rugby World Cup, and gave renewed momentum propelling Argentina towards joining one of those competitions. During their World Cup run, the normally football-crazed Argentines embraced the Pumas so much that El Supercl√°sico, the Buenos Aires football derby between Boca Juniors and River Plate, was rescheduled so that it would not conflict with the Pumas' quarter-final match. As the only major Spanish language country in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the Pumas also had considerable support from rugby fans in Spain, Uruguay, and other Latin American countries during their impressive five-game winning streak. After the 2007 World Cup In November 2007, in the wake of Argentina's World Cup run, the future status of Los Pumas was a key topic of discussion at an IRB conference on the future worldwide growth of the sport. The decisions made at the conference regarding Argentina were: * The Pumas will play more annual tests, increasing from the previous six tests per year to nine by 2010. The team would play four tests in the June test window, three in November, and two during the Six Nations window in February and March. * Between 2008 and 2010, Argentina would develop a domestic professional structure, with the goal of having the majority of Argentine professionals playing at home. Sometime around 2012, Los Pumas will then be \\"fully integrated into the Southern top- flight Rugby playing structure\\" (read \\"Tri Nations\\"). On March 13, 2008, Santiago Phelan was named as the coach of the Argentine rugby union team, filling the vacancy left by Marcelo Loffreda. On 7 June 2008, the Pumas beat Scotland 21‚Äì15 in Rosario, Argentina, thus maintaining their position as the third highest ranked team in the IRB rankings. In June 2009 the British media reported that Argentina were lobbying for the 2013 British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia to incorporate provincial games and test matches in Argentina, but nothing came of this proposal. Argentina failed to get a test series victory under Phelan, with a draw against Scotland in 2008 and England in 2009, before losing 2‚Äì0 to Scotland in 2010. 2011 Rugby World Cup RWC 2011 in New Zealand. World Cup preparations for Los Pumas began with a drawn 1‚Äì1 series against the French Barbarians, a 78‚Äì15 win against a South American Invitational XV, and a 21‚Äì15 victory against the Aviva Premiership club Worcester Warriors. In their only international test warm-up match, Los Pumas lost 28‚Äì13 to Wales in Cardiff. Felipe Contepomi, captain of Los Pumas during the RWC 2011. Los Pumas kicked off their 2011 World Cup with a 13‚Äì9 loss against England, a match which they led for over 60 minutes. They next beat Romania 43‚Äì8. The following match against Scotland decided which team would reach the quarterfinals. A late try by replacement fullback Lucas Gonz√°lez Amorosino and a successful conversion meant Los Pumas won 13‚Äì12. Argentina finished the pool stage by winning 25‚Äì9 against Georgia. Argentina's final match of the tournament was the quarterfinal against eventual champions All Blacks. In a surprisingly close first half, Argentina led 7‚Äì6 after 30 minutes following a try by Julio Far√≠as Cabello. As the game went on, the All Blacks began to dominate, leading to a final score of 33‚Äì10. While not as glamorous as the 2007 tournament for the Pumas, their campaign was considered relatively successful as they qualified for the quarterfinals from a pool that featured England and Scotland, and put up a valiant quarterfinal display against the All Blacks. It marked the first time that Argentina qualified for the quarterfinals in two consecutive World Cup tournaments. 2012: The Rugby Championship In 2012, Argentina again drew a test series against France. 2012 saw a major breakthrough for the Pumas, as they joined The Rugby Championship (formerly known as the Tri Nations) against New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. This was the first time Argentina participated in an annual Tier 1 international competition. Argentina played its first match of the 2012 Rugby Championship against South Africa in Cape Town on 18 August 2012, losing 27‚Äì6. Argentina quickly recovered one week later in Mendoza to achieve a 16‚Äì16 score against South Africa, its first draw in history against the Springboks. Argentina acquitted themselves well against Australia, losing 19‚Äì23 and then 19‚Äì25 to earn a losing bonus point in each match. Argentina also played respectably against the All Blacks in New Zealand, with Argentina keeping the score 5‚Äì6 at the half before losing 5‚Äì21. Despite ending bottom of the table with just 4 points and no wins in their inaugural season, Argentina proved hard to beat when home. In the November 2012 test series, Argentina beat Wales at the Millennium Stadium, and lost against France and Ireland also on the road. In June 2013, the team lost both matches against England in Argentina, and beat tier 2 squad Georgia. Argentina lost 2‚Äì0 to England in 2013 including a record 32‚Äì3 defeat in the opening test, the biggest losing margin Argentina has had against England on home soil. Argentina achieved the occasional \\"upset\\", including a 9‚Äì6 win over Scotland at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh and a 26‚Äì12 win over Wales, who at the time were the Six Nations Grand Slam Champions, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. In 2013, Argentina began their second tournament with a record breaking 73‚Äì13 defeat by South Africa, which was South Africa's biggest winning margin over Argentina. In the reverse fixture at home in round 2, Argentina proved to be a formidable team, but lost narrowlly to South Africa 17‚Äì22. In round 3 they played New Zealand who was victorious in the match 28‚Äì13. In Round 4, they lost to Australia in Perth 14‚Äì13. In the corresponding home fixture, Argentina lost 54‚Äì17 to Australia, a record losing margin against Australia at home. It was the second year in a row with Argentina finishing bottom of the table at the Rugby Championship, this time losing all matches. On October 21, 2013, Phelan stepped down from his post as Los Pumas head coach, one year early from the end of his contract. Over the 45 matches that he coached in his 5-year tenure, he earned 13 wins, 31 defeats and 1 draw. Daniel Hourcade was hired as new Pumas head coach in October 2013. In November 2013, the Pumas were beaten by England and Wales in Twickenham and Cardiff, and later won against Italy in Rome. In the 2014 mid-year rugby union internationals, Argentina lost their games against Ireland and Scotland. On 5 October 2014, Los Pumas achieved their first ever win in the Rugby Championship, defeating Australia 21‚Äì17 at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza, their first win over Australia in 17 years. Despite that win, Argentina finished in last place in the Rugby Championship for the third consecutive year. In the 2014 European end-of-year tests, Argentina lost to Scotland, and beat Italy and France, In the 2015 Rugby Championship, Argentina beat South Africa for the first time 37‚Äì25. 2015 Rugby World Cup Los Pumas against the All Blacks, in the Wembley Stadium during the RWC 2015. Argentina followed their growing competitiveness in the Rugby Championship with a strong showing in the 2015 World Cup, reaching the semi-finals for the second time. Argentina opened the tournament with a close fought match against favourites New Zealand, leading 13‚Äì12 at half time before eventually conceding two second half tries to lose 26‚Äì16. They followed this with a string of convincing wins against Georgia, Tonga and Namibia to qualify for the quarterfinals. A feature of Argentina's rugby in the 2015 World Cup was their free-flowing, entertaining and attacking style of play which resulted in them scoring 22 tries in pool play. In the quarter final against Ireland, Argentina scored two tries in the opening 10 minutes to jump out to an early 17‚Äì0 lead. Ireland regrouped and scored two tries of their own either side of half time to narrow the gap to 20-17 early in the second half. However, Argentina rallied in the late stages of the match, running in late tries by Juan Imhoff and Joaqu√≠n Tuculet to eventually finish with a convincing 43‚Äì20 win. As a result, they advanced to their second semi- final against Australia. The situation was reversed in the semi-final, when Argentina conceded 2 tries in the opening 10 minutes as Australia gained a 19‚Äì6 lead after 30 minutes. Argentina dominated the territory and possession of the remainder of the match, gaining a number of penalties at the scrum to gradually reduce Australia's lead. The match was finely balanced with Australia leading 22-15 after 70 minutes, when Australian winger Drew Mitchell produced a match winning run, beating 4 Argentinian tacklers before passing to Adam Ashley-Cooper to score the winning try. The match finished with Australia winning a fast-paced and entertaining clash 29‚Äì15.

It opened on Tirana Boulevard (formerly 'Omladinskih Brigada') in 1936, having been constructed by a French/British company. Trains calling at the station are operated by Trainkos sh.a. The line on which the station sits is single-track, laid to standard gauge, but there is a loop at the station, allowing trains to pass there, with a second, parallel, loop lying out-of-use as of October 2016. A daily international train runs between Pristina and Skopje (Shkup), in North Macedonia. Pristina is also served by the larger Kosovo Polje railway station at nearby Fush√´ Kosov√´.  Events  During the era when Kosovo was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the country's leader Marshall Tito occasionally visited Pristina, arriving on his personal Blue Train. During the 1999 Kosovo War, Serbian and Yugoslav regular forces, in conjunction with paramilitaries, conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanian inhabitants of Pristina through the station. Many of those expelled were directed onto trains apparently brought there for the express purpose of deporting them to the Macedonian border, where they were forced into exile. The station was restored by British soldiers, serving as part of KFOR, later in 1999.

Each episode features Morton reading a new chapter of an amateur erotic novel, titled Belinda Blinked, written by his father under the pen name Rocky Flintstone. Morton, Cooper, and Levine react to the material and provide running commentary. Cooper and Levine are hearing the chapter for the first time, whereas Morton usually reads the chapter before recording the episode. As of 2020, the series has had over 250 million downloads. On 11 May 2019, HBO aired a comedy special of the show which features a \\"lost chapter\\" from one of the books. The special was filmed over two nights in front of a live audience at the Roundhouse theatre in London. Origin and format The podcast began in 2015 and is presented by television writer and director Jamie Morton, digital executive James Cooper, and TV and radio presenter Alice Levine. The three originally met at the University of Leeds, began working in broadcasting, and had worked together on projects before the My Dad Wrote a Porno podcasts. The podcast originated at a family gathering for Morton's sister's birthday, where Morton's father took him into his study and handed him some chapters of a novel he had been writing under the pen name Rocky Flintstone in his garden shed (Morton claims his mother won't let his father write it in the house). Morton realised with shock that he was reading the first chapter of his father's erotic novel, Belinda Blinked. He shared the chapter with friends at a Christmas lunch, where Levine suggested they should create a podcast. Morton played the My Dad Wrote a Porno pilot to his family, who were encouraging; while his mother initially found it disgusting, she is now fully supportive. The podcast recording usually takes place informally in one of the hosts' houses and 90 minutes of recording is edited by Morton into one 40-minute episode. The podcast is hosted by Acast, which secures the advertising that funds the production. The advert is then scripted into the advertising section of the podcast and performed by the three presenters. The rest of the podcast is unscripted and spontaneous. Cooper and Levine have not heard the chapter before the recording, whereas Morton has read through it shortly before recording the episode to familiarise himself with the phrasing and prepare for any accents he may have to adopt. Series 1 (2015) consisted of 13 episodes, with 4 \\"Footnotes\\" episodes and a \\"Best of\\" episode. Series 2 (2016) consisted of 17 episodes, with 16 \\"Footnotes\\" episodes and a \\"Best of\\" episode. Series 3 (2017) consisted of 15 episodes, with 14 \\"Footnotes\\" episodes and a \\"Best of\\" episode. Belinda Blinked Belinda Blinked is a genuine series of at least six books, three of which are available as self-published e-books for sale and download. As of 2017, Flintstone was working on the sixth book and has said he intends to continue as he \\"needs the money\\". The first four books were written and completed before the podcast began airing in 2015. The first was released in March 2015 under its full title, Belinda Blinked; 1 A modern story of sex, erotica and passion. How the sexiest sales girl in business earns her huge bonus by being the best at removing her high heels. The second followed in July 2016, entitled Belinda Blinked; 2 The continuing story of, dripping sex, passion and big business deals.: Keep following the sexiest sales girl in business as she earns her huge bonus by removing her silk blouse. The third was released in May 2017, called Belinda Blinked; 3: The continuing erotic story of sexual activity, dripping action and even bigger business deals as Belinda relentlessly continues to earn her huge bonus. The fourth was released in November 2018, called Belinda Blinked 4;: An erotic story of sexual prowess, sexy characters and even bigger business deals whilst the darkness increases;. The fifth book in the series was the first book written after the podcast premiered and was released in December 2019 with the title Belinda Blinked 5: Belinda Blumenthal, worldwide Sales Director of Steeles Pots and Pans is in big trouble. Can the sexiest girl in sales continue to remove her brassiere whilst the evil grows.Amazon AU website, accessed 10 June 2020. The novels tell the story of the sexual exploits of Belinda Blumenthal and her work in the sales and marketing department of the fictional company Steeles Pots and Pans. Belinda's work takes her around the world, where she meets various sales reps, suppliers, and business associates. Many characters regularly appear throughout the series, although some are introduced only to never be heard from again, or even change name halfway through a chapter. The writing is erratic and Morton has said, \\"One moment Belinda is handcuffed to a trellis in a 'medium-sized maze', the next she's at a charity tombola raising funds for the Asses & Donkeys Trust.\\"  Rocky Flintstone  \\"Rocky Flintstone\\" is the pen name of Morton's father, a retired Northern Irish builder. According to Flintstone, the name \\"Rocky\\" was inspired by The Rockford Files and a family friend's dog living in Brazil, also named Rocky. \\"Flintstone\\" is inspired by the author's degree in geology and his self- identification with Fred Flintstone as he batters on the door waiting to be allowed back indoors at the end of each Flintstones episode. Before retiring, Flintstone worked as a builder, teacher, and, like his protagonist, in sales. Flintstone prefers to remain out of the podcast spotlight. Series and episodesPodcast guests The podcast features \\"Footnotes\\" episodes which run concurrently with the series, in which they discuss aspects of the phenomenon and invite notable listeners to discuss Belinda Blinked, offer suggestions, and discuss potential film castings.

HBO special  On 27 August 2018, it was announced that HBO had plans to produce a comedy special based on the live tour of My Dad Wrote A Porno. It features a \\"lost chapter\\" from one of the books, and has various segments, including audience participation and live reenactments. The special was filmed over two nights in front of a live audience at the Roundhouse theatre in London. The special aired on HBO on 11 May 2019, and in the UK on Sky Atlantic on 16 May. Other media The first series of My Dad Wrote a Porno was published as a book on 27 October 2016. It was designed as a spoof \\"study guide\\" with comments, annotations, character appraisals, key themes, and games provided by the hosts. In June 2017, a copy of the book signed by the hosts and Flintstone was auctioned as part of a fundraiser for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire. The My Dad Wrote a Porno live show has toured the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the USA including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland and Just For Laughs comedy festival in Canada. The live show was adapted into an HBO comedy special on 11 May 2019. The team have also been approached about adapting the material into a film. Based on the \\"Footnotes\\" episodes the team have postulated, \\"Elijah Wood's playing the youngish man. Daisy Ridley's the Duchess. Michael Sheen's Dr. Robbins, he was very excited about that. Thomas Middleditch wanted to be Dr Robbins too, so they'll have to fight for that. Rachel Bloom wanted to be Jim Sterling in prosthetics.\\" Reception The podcast initially ran into problems with its title, with iTunes refusing to list it and advertisers being reluctant to be involved. As of 2020, the podcast has been downloaded over 250 million times. Dedicated fans are known as \\"Belinkers\\" and on Mondays, when a new episode is released, the hashtag #PornoDay trends on Twitter.

He lived in London from 1991 to 2010 where he trained at the University of the Arts London, gaining his bachelor of arts in 1999. Obergfell lives and works in Berlin. LondonLast Stop Routemasters (2004‚Äì2008)= Obergfell lived in London from 1991 to 2010. In 2004, he joined Photodebut, a London-based collective of twenty-five emerging photographic artists. His work later appeared in Case Study, an art photography volume released by the collective. His first solo exhibition Last Stop: Routemasters, focusing on design, cultural and social aspects of the AEC Routemaster, was shown at the London Transport Museum in 2008, accompanied by an interactive website which was later permanently archived for preservation by the British Library. Critical response to the exhibition and associated multimedia projects was positive, with Time Out London describing it as \\"a plumbline to the reservoir of emotions associated with the [Routemaster].\\" The eponymous book accompanying the exhibition was later nominated for the London And/Or Photography Book Prize. Photos from the series also appeared in the book Cult Masterpieces: Icons of Our Generation, by Dirk Alt and Birgit Niefanger. In 2005, BBC broadcaster Robert Elms said of the style of the photography in Last Stop Routemasters, 'it's beautiful [...] it's almost bus porn'. The project was described in ArtReview as '[a]n invaluable account of what some say is the greatest bus on earth'. The project was also reviewed positively in Time Out London where it was called '[a] fascinating set of photographs' and was featured in the magazine's \\"Critic's Choice\\" section in June 2008. The reviewer for Obergfell's hometown newspaper, the Badische Zeitung wrote that 'the photographs have a timeless quality and will serve as an important reminder for generations to come'. =Gutterslut (2007‚Äì2014)= Working in creative collaboration with artist Jonny Woo and DJs Per QX and Nic Fisher, Obergfell co-founded the LGBTQIA+ club event Gutterslut in London during this period.

Gutterslut was attended by partygoers, drag artists and celebrities including the Pet Shop Boys whose singer Neil Tennant said of the party: \\"'These days, we often go to Berghain [the infamous Berlin club] on a Sunday lunchtime, or Gutterslut in east London. [...] I personally like crazy nights with ridiculous drag queens, not people taking photos of the DJ all night.'\\" Images of Gutterslut events appear in the book New Club Kids: London Party Fashion in the Noughties by Oggy Yordanov. In the summer of 2012, Obergfell, together with Trailer Trash and his fellow Gutterslut organisers, hosted the Big Top stage at Lovebox Festival in Victoria Park, London, with a lineup that included Tiga, James Murphy, Pat Mahoney of LCD Soundsystem, Ivan Smagghe and headliner DJ Hell.https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to- do/gutterslut-trailer-trash-lovebox-victoria- park-17-june-2012https://www.vice.com/da/article/pp89bz/lovebox-noisey-arena- gutter-slut-trailer-trash-vice-blog.

During this period, Obergfell began to experiment with artistic portrait photography. Working with installation artist Tony Hornecker, he created his second solo exhibition, Beautiful Freaks, in 2009, which was first shown at the Dalston Superstore with photographs featuring drag artists who appeared at East London nightclubs around that time. The Dalston Superstore referred to Obergfell's photographs as \\"images that will become historical, and mark a period in time.\\" In an interview with i-D magazine, Obergfell described the project as \\"a portraiture series and a tribute to our friends, some of London's most iconic creatures of the night.\\" The show was later selected to be displayed at the Royal College of Art in London as part of the Gender and Performance group show. Southeast AsiaUrak Lawoi (2004‚Äì2017)= Starting in 2004, Obergfell has regularly worked in Southeast Asia, creating photographic travelogues and working on photojournalistic projects in Indonesia (Bali, Borneo), Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia.

Poikas focuses on artistic portrait photography of men, using amateur models. The series uses impromptu, experimental lighting and intimate close-ups. It examines expressions of everyday masculinity and sexuality in contemporary Berlin, in the context of late-capitalism and ongoing gentrification. Selections from the series were included in the exhibition Boys! Boys! Boys! at The Little Black Gallery in London in 2018, curated by Paddle8. Obergfell's photo \\"Blue Boy\\" appeared in the book that accompanied the Boys! Boys!

He was offered an appointment to the Senate of Canada in October 2016 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but ultimately declined to take his seat for \\"personal, family, and professional reasons\\" in February 2017.  Career  Chochinov is a leading expert in palliative care, with a focus on the dignity of patients, proper communication, and existential suffering. He developed dignity therapy, which is currently used by doctors worldwide as its benefits for patients at the end of life, relatives and health professionals have been proved. Dignity therapy involves creating a narrative document with the dying patient that gives them the chance to reflect on their life experiences. He was a co-founder of the Canadian Virtual Hospice, which serves as a resource centre for anyone involved with palliative care. He is a distinguished professor of psychiatry at the University of Manitoba and the director of the Manitoba Palliative Care Research Unit at CancerCare. In 2012, Chochinov won the Canadian Medical Association's Frederic Newton Gisborne Starr Award, for his contributions to palliative care. In 2015, Chochinov chaired the External Panel on Options for a Legislative Response to Carter v. Canada which informed eventual legislation on medically-assisted death. Chochinov was himself an opponent of medically- assisted death. In November 2015, Chochinov was invested as an Officer of the Order of Canada for his work on improving end-of-life care for Canadians. In April 2016, Chochinov was named the University of Manitoba's first research chair in palliative care medicine.

He was Chief of the Navy from 1970 to 1978. Career Lundvall was born on 30 October 1915 in Bj√∂rk√§ng parish, T√∂reboda Municipality, Sweden, the son of the clerk Gottfrid Lundvall and his wife Elna (n√©e Andersson). He passed studentexamen in Sk√∂vde in 1934 and graduated from the Royal Swedish Naval Academy in 1938. He was commissioned as a naval officer in the Swedish Navy the same year with the rank of acting sub- lieutenant (f√§nrik), after which he was promoted to sub-lieutenant (l√∂jtnant) in 1940. He trained for submarine duty and did submarine service during the World War II's neutrality guard and a few years after the end of the war. He also specialized in connection, radio, radar and combat control. He completed the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College general course and staff course from 1944 to 1946. He also passed the signal officer course at the Submarine School. Lundvall was promoted to lieutenant (kapten) in 1946 and attended the Royal Navy's signal and radar school from 1946 to 1947. He was captain and division commander of submarines and was promoted to commander of the 2nd rank in 1954 and of the first rank in 1957. Lundwall was captain of the minelayer in 1957 and 1958 during which the ship transported expeditions to the Swedish station Kinnvika on Svalbard during the International Polar Year. Lundvall was military expert in the Airport Committee in 1956 and the 1960 and the 1962 Defense Committee. He was also an naval contributor to the Svenska Dagbladet from 1957 to 1964. He also served in the staff of the Chief of the Coastal Fleet and was adjutant of the commanding officer of the Submarine Department and was head of the Communications and Planning Department in the Naval Staff as well as head of the Planning Department in the Defence Staff. Lundvall was promoted to captain in 1961 and was appointed head in the Operations Management in the Defence Staff. He was Vice Chief of the Defence Staff from 1964 to 1966 when he was promoted to rear admiral. Lundvall was then chief of the staff of the Eastern Military District (Milo √ñ) from 1966 to 1970 and was promoted to vice admiral in 1970. Lundvall was Chief of the Navy from 1970 to 1978 and was promoted to full admiral upon retirement. In June 1975 Lundvall invited, after consultation with the Chief of Naval Operations in the United States, admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, and the First Sea Lord in the United Kingdom, admiral Sir Edward Ashmore, to the North Atlantic Seapower Symposium in Saltsj√∂baden. Lundvall's intention was, among other things, that the naval chiefs of the East and West would meet each other for the first time since the end of World War II to discuss marine issues and thus increase stability in the areas around the North Atlantic. During a week, naval chiefs from the United States (admiral James L. Holloway III), United Kingdom (admiral Ashmore), Canada, Iceland, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, West Germany, East Germany and Poland participated. From the Soviet Union, Admiral Amelko, who was the naval commander Leningrad, was a substitute for admiral Gorshkov who was unable to attend. The meeting became a veritable success and was repeated in the summer of 1978 in Finland. Post retirement He was inspector of the association UppSj√∂ from 1970 to 1978 and was board member of Sal√©ninvest AB from 1976 to 1982 and chairman of the foundation Ymer 80 from 1979 to 2000. Lundvall had a strong feeling for his home district and was a board member of AB G√∂ta kanalbolag from 1978 to 1984 and after his retirement improved the so-called Kanalvillan (the Canal Villa) in Forsvik, which became his home. After his active military career, Lundvall took the initiative for a polar expedition in memory of Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld's expedition through the Northeast Passage with the ship 1878-1880. Lundvall served as chief operating officer for the expedition that was carried out by the icebreaker Ymer during the summer of 1980. He also took the initiative to form the foundation Ymer-80 in order to support young researchers and was its chairman for 10 years. In 1998, it was revealed in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that during the Cold War, Lundvall as Chief of the Navy would leave Sweden for the United Kingdom to establish a Swedish war time headquarters in case of a Soviet invasion of Sweden. From there, he would, in close cooperation with the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces back in Sweden, coordinate the warfare with support from the west, mainly from the NATO countries United Kingdom and the United States. If the defense management in Sweden failed, he would take over the highest Swedish command and lead the battle on Swedish soil with regular units. In a situation where the Swedish defence failed and Sweden became occupied, it was the Chief of the Navy's task to start the resistance. The Chief of the Navy's mission was so secret that it was never written down on paper, nor did Lundvall ever mentioned this to his wife or his son who also was an naval officer. This mission was confirmed by both Lundvall himself and the former Supreme Commander Stig Synnergren. Personal life In 1941 he married Karin Rydn√§s (born 1920), the daughter of the merchant Johannes Rydn√§s and Ida Spjuth. He was the father of Thomas (born 1943), Ylva (born 1945) and Boel (born 1949). Lundvall died on 30 November 2010 in Unden√§s parish, Karlsborg Municipality.

Built in 1902, it is a prominent and imposing example of Classical Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Mayo Building is prominently located in Northfield's central Depot Square area, facing that square from across South Main Street (Vermont Route 12). It is a four-story masonry structure, with a flat roof, exterior of brick with granite trim, and is the commercial district's tallest building. Its ground floor is divided into two store fronts with a central building entrance. The storefronts are framed by square granite posts at the outer building corners, and by round granite columns that separate them from the main entrance, with recessed store entrances flanked by glass display windows. Second story windows are set in rectangular openings with granite sills and lintels, while third floor windows are in segmented-arch openings with granite keystones and sills. Fourth story windows are also set in segmented-arch openings, but are topped by keystoned granite caps. The facade is capped by a broad cornice and decorative stamped metal entablature. with The block was built in 1902 for Dr. William Mayo, a prominent local politician and businessman. It was designed by Lane & Son of Burlington.

Two variants, the Couzinet 101 and Couzinet 103, were very similar apart from their engines; no variant reached production. Design The Couzinet 100 series of touring aircraft was broadly similar to its contemporary the Couzinet 20 but was smaller, with a span reduced to 84%, carried three rather than five and had a fixed undercarriage. It used similarly low-powered engines and had Couzinet's characteristic fin, formed from the fuselage. The Couzinet 101 had a one piece, low, cantilever wing, constructed entirely from wood, with a single spar which ran from tip to tip and a rear false spar interrupted by the cabin. It was plywood-skinned and thick at the root but thinned progressively outboard from below, providing a little dihedral. Chord was also large at the root, where the wing was generously faired into the fuselage. The plan became trapezoidal outboard with long, approximately elliptical tips. The straight part of the trailing edges were filled with long, narrow-chord ailerons carrying ground-adjustable trim tabs. Two of the 101's three , seven-cylinder Pobjoy R radial engines, enclosed in NACA cowlings, were mounted ahead of the leading edges on steel frames isolated on rubber blocks and toed outwards. The third was in the fuselage nose. All had their own oil tanks and fire extinguishers; fuel was stored in the wings. The fuselage was a wooden semi-monocoque formed with frames and stringers. The enclosed cabin seated three in tandem, with the pilot at the leading edge between the engines and the two passengers behind. Each occupant had both roof and side windows. Behind the cabin the fuselage curved upwards in Couzinet's distinctive way, the upper side narrowing to form a very broad-chord fin; its one-piece, almost triangular tailplane was built into the fuselage, carrying very narrow elevators. Like the ailerons, these had ground adjustable tabs. The rudder had a rather pointed tip but was curved and full; extending down to the keel, it operated in a slight elevator cut- out. All versions of the Couzinet 100 had fixed, tailwheel landing gear. When the Couzinet 100, powered by Salmson 9 ADb radials made its first flight it had mainwheels in trouser fairings and relied on low pressure tyres to absorb landing shocks. One flight was enough to see its return to the factory, where a more conventional three strut arrangement was installed. The Couzinet 101 had similar gear, each wheel with a near-vertical oleo strut to the forward spar in the inner wing and a cranked axle and drag strut from the lower fuselage. The wheels, in spats, were below the outer engines with a track of . The mainwheels had independent brakes and the tailwheel castored on its oleo strut. Development The forward fuselage of the Couzinet 100 was on display at the 13th Paris Salon in November 1932. It first flew at Villacoublay on 23 June 1933. The Pobjoy-engined 101 was there early in November, being prepared for flight and still referred to as the Couzinet 100. It first flew between 11 and 18 November. At the end of February 1934 it returned from tests with C.E.M.A. for modifications to the fuel system. The Couzinet 101 failed to attract buyers and the sole example, F-AMTJ, was the only Couzinet 100 series aircraft to be registered. It became one of the many unusual aircraft to be bought by the Spanish (Republican) government when the Spanish Civil War began in 1936. Its subsequent history is unknown. Little is recorded about the Couzinet 103, which was powered by three Salmson 9 ADr radials. Variants ;Couzinet 100: 3 √ó Salmson 9 ADb. Flew 23 June 1930.

The case was sent back to the trial court for additional review. However, the case was settled before there was a final court determination as to whether the river was a public highway. The settlement, which can be found under Appendix 12 of the Moose River Plains Wild Forest Unit Management Plan, allows the public to use the river at certain times of the year and under certain conditions. Although Adirondack League Club vs. Sierra Club established that recreational use can be considered in determining whether a river is a public highway, in Friends of Thayer Lake, LLC v. Brown, the New York Court of Appeals declined to answer whether the capacity for recreational use alone is sufficient to prove that a river is a public highway, and sent the case back to the trial court for consideration of \\"the Waterway's historical and prospective commercial utility, the Waterway's historical accessibility to the public, the relative ease of passage by canoe, the volume of historical travel, and the volume of prospective commercial and recreational use.\\" The trial court ruled in favor of the landowners, and the decision was not appealed.  \\"Navigable-in-fact\\"  500x500px Rivers were once important means of transporting commodities such as logs to market, and in the nineteenth century, the New York legislature declared numerous rivers public highways using their power of eminent domain. In contrast to rivers declared public highways by statute, the term \\"navigable-in-fact\\" generally refers to rivers of such importance that they are considered public highways under the common law. The Court of Appeals states that \\"This rule is longstanding and recognizes that some waterways are of such practical utility that private ownership from the time of the original grant from the State or sovereign is subject to an easement for public travel (see, id., at 458).\\" Every state has its own definition of navigable-in-fact, and the federal government has multiple definitions of \\"navigable\\" that are applied depending on the circumstance, such as the extent of regulations, admiralty jurisdiction, or title.. New York's definition of \\"navigable-in- fact\\" was established by the 1866 Morgan v. King case, which involved the 23 miles of the Raquette River between Colton, New York and Raymondville, at an average width of 18 rods (297 feet). The legislature had attempted to declare the river a public highway by eminent domain in 1850, but had not provided appropriate compensation to affected riparian owners. A watermill owned by the defendant King detained plaintiff Morgan's logs in 1854. Morgan claimed the river was a public highway and therefore King should pay him for his logs. The Court of Appeals needed to determine whether the river was a public highway. In Morgan v. King, the Court of Appeals provided the original definition for what would be considered a public highway in New York: The Raquette River at Raymondville, the lower end of the section the Morgan court declared private property under the common law, stating \\"It would be going beyond the warrant of either principle or precedent to hold that a floatable capacity, so temporary, precarious and unprofitable, constituted the stream a public highway\\" However, the Court of Appeals ruled regarding the nearly 300-foot wide, 23-mile section of the Raquette River \\"It would be going beyond the warrant of either principle or precedent to hold that a floatable capacity, so temporary, precarious and unprofitable, constituted the stream a public highway\\" and that the legislature recognized that the river was private \\"property that could not be taken for public use without compensation.\\" Like the federal courts, New York courts also use \\"navigability\\" definitions in cases pertaining to issues other than property rights, such as taxation and regulation. While the U.S. Supreme Court established for federal courts that \\"any reliance upon judicial precedent must be predicated upon careful appraisal of the purpose for which the concept of \`navigability' was invoked in a particular case,\\" a nuanced approach most recently applied by the U.S. Supreme Court in PPL Montana,, 132 S. Ct. 1215 (2012). New York courts have yet to make a similar distinction. Navigability precedents from taxation and regulation cases were cited in the Adirondack League Club vs. Sierra Club property rights case. Before Adirondack League Club v. Sierra Club, New York statutory and case law had virtually no mention of recreational use in definitions of navigable-in-fact. The Adirondack League Club v. Sierra Club case was to decide whether recreational boating can be considered when determining whether or not a river was a public highway. The Court of Appeals summarized the disagreement between the parties about whether recreational use should be considered:  Case  The Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter was seeking a test case to use common law to open waterways that had been considered private property. They explored a number of rivers, including the Middle Branch of the St. Regis River, and the Beaver River between Lake Lila and Stillwater Reservoir. They settled on the South Branch of the Moose River running through the Adirondack League Club, which not only could be canoed and kayaked, but \\"was heavily used over the course of at least 50 years for floating logs to market.\\" On June 15, 1991, five boaters in two canoes and one kayak embarked on a trip going down stream on the South Branch of the Moose River in New York. For the boaters to successfully complete their journey, they were forced by obstacles to make several stops to carry their boats over Adirondack League Club land. Once the trip was completed the Adirondack League Club sued the boaters and the Sierra Club for trespass. The Adirondack League Club claimed the portion of the South Branch in question was private property and recreation was not part of the navigability-in-fact law already in place from Morgan v. King and should not be considered. The boaters argued that the South Branch of the Moose River was a public highway, and modern recreational use should be considered, in addition to historical commercial use.  Decision  The New York Court of Appeals held that recreational use could be considered in determining whether a river was navigable-in-fact, but that factual questions remained that prevented them from deciding whether the South Branch of the Moose River was a public highway, and denied defendants' motion for summary judgement. The majority stated: The majority felt that the evidence regarding the historical log driving and modern recreational use were inconclusive. They wrote that \\"we are unable to conclude, as a matter of law, that the historical log drives on the South Branch were not accomplished by use of dams and other artificial augmentation of the river flow\\" and that \\"the evidence of recreational use does not compel the conclusion that substantially unobstructed travel on the South Branch can occur periodically or seasonally.\\" The case was sent back to the trial court, where it was settled in 2000, allowing public access to the river at certain times of the year and under certain conditions. However, there was never a final court determination as to whether the South Branch of the Moose River was a public highway.  Cases using ALC v. SC as precedent  * Friends of Thayer Lake LLC v.

Its first event was in 2010 in Clissold Park Hackney London, where has existed since its inception. The Yoruba's are a people predominantly from Western Nigeria who over time migrated to other parts of West Africa to Togo, Benin, Ghana, Senegal, Mali and Sierra-Leone and Liberia. They are also the largest group of people taken during the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade holocaust to the West Indies and Latin America where their culture, traditions and belief systems have stood the test of time and are still being practiced. The Yoruba IFA/Orisa belief system created the foundation for new age religions such as Santeria, Umbanda and Lucumi. As a global culture, the Yorubas remain linked around the world through language, history, art, music as well as the belief and practice of IFA/ Orisa. In the UK, the Yoruba's are the largest group of people from outside Nigeria and Africa who have made important contributions to their communities and local governments in education, sports, medicine, business, religion, media, politics and charitable causes. The 9th edition of the festival returns to Clissold Park, Hackney, London on Saturday the 21st and Sunday 22nd of July 2018 celebrating the rich, colorful and vibrant Arts and Culture of the Yoruba's from around the world. Featuring Cultural performances, Workshops, Arts and crafts, Competitions, African Market, African food and live music from artists and bands showcasing the wide variety of popular Yoruba music such as Afrobeats, Juju, Highlife, Apala and Jazz. The Yoruba Arts festival returns for its 10th year at Clissold Park in October 2019. The festival will be held during the Black History month to celebrate not only Yoruba Arts and Culture but the contributions and achievements of African Arts and Culture in the UK. The event will feature Cultural performances, workshops, African Arts and Crafts market, traditional African food and live music from local and international bands performing a variety of African, Nigerian and Yoruba music. The annual festival is organised, produced and funded by the Yoruba Foundation, a UK registered non-profit charity whose main objectives are to promote Yoruba Arts and Culture through free community and charitable programs.

She applied for asylum in October 1990, and is believed to have been the first woman to cite FGM as a reason for seeking refugee status. Both Diop's initial application and an appeal in September 1991 were denied on technical grounds, as she had failed to seek help from the Malian government before fleeing the country. However, she was subsequently allowed to stay in France. Life in Mali Diop was born into a Muslim family in Sikasso, a large town in Mali's south, with her native language being Bambara. At the age of 12, she was sent to school in the capital Bamako. Diop was betrothed to the son of her father's best friend at the age of eight, but a wedding was not scheduled until much later. According to the local tradition, she was required to undergo a ritual circumcision before she could be married, which would involve the removal of her clitoris and inner labia. As her best friend had recently died from the procedure, Diop begged both her father and her future husband for an exemption, but they refused and her father beat her. On the day she was to undergo the procedure, Diop ran away from home, walking and hitchhiking to an aunt's house in Bamako. Her aunt threw her out once she explained why she had run away, but a friend who worked for a Belgian airline organised a passport and bought her a one-way ticket to Brussels. From there, she travelled to Paris. Because Diop had not fulfilled the terms of her marriage contract, her father had to refund the bridewealth to the groom's family. He subsequently laid the blame for his daughter's defiance on his wife, who he threw out of the house. Life in France and asylum claim In France, Diop initially stayed with a Malian couple she had known previously. She was later taken in by Ren√©e Boutet de Monvel, a gynaecologist and anti-FGM campaigner. In October 1990, Diop applied to the French government for political asylum, under the terms of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. She is believed to have been the first woman in any country to cite genital mutilation as a reason for seeking asylum. Diop's first application was rejected, but her lawyer, Linda Weil-Curiel, appealed the decision. At the appeal in September 1991, the Commission for Appeals of Refugees again denied her asylum, on the grounds that she had not sought help from the Malian government before leaving the country. However, it did agree that women fleeing FGM were protected under the Refugee Convention, becoming the first judicial body to do so. Weil-Curiel, Diop's lawyer, has expressed the view that the French government denied Diop's asylum application for political reasons ‚Äì a positive ruling would have opened a new channel for African immigration, and thus contradicted the government's anti-immigration stance. Due to public outcry over the decision, including an international letter-writing campaign, the government allowed Diop to remain in the country. She initially received a three-month temporary visa, which was extended by a year in December 1991 and later extended indefinitely. Diop suffered a period of depression when she first arrived in France, but in October 1992 it was reported that she was adapting better, taking daily French classes and working part-time as an office cleaner.

He was also the chancellor of New York University and Long Island University.  Early life  Stoddard was born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania where he would be class valedictorian when he graduated from high school in 1915. He grew up Methodist but would become a Unitarian later in life. After graduating high school he worked at a bank before enrolling at Pennsylvania State University where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He left college to serve in World War I as a second lieutenant of infantry in the U.S. Army. After the war he returned to Penn State and received his A.B. degree in 1921. He then returned to Europe to study child psychology at the University of Paris where he studied under Theodore Simon and received a diploma. He went on to receive his doctorate at the University of Iowa in 1925.  Career = University of Iowa  His teaching career began at the University of Iowa where he became a professor of psychology after graduation. He would go on to be the department chair and dean of the graduate school. In 1929 he was appointed director of the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station. While director of the station he would debate with Dr. Lewis Terman of Stanford University on the nature of intelligence and the usefulness of intelligence testing. Stoddard defended the view that environment and intelligence influenced each other. Terman advocated that intelligence was unchanging and based almost entirely on heredity.  University of the State of New York  Stoddard was named president of the University of the State of New York and Commissioner of Education in September 1942. As commissioner he was vocally against letting 14 year olds drop out of school to work because they could potentially be exploited.  Japan  In 1946, he was assigned to General Douglas MacArthur to advise on establishing a new Japanese educational system. He was also asked by Emperor Hirohito to find a tutor for Prince Akihito. He was then assigned to the U.S. delegation for UNESCO at their first meeting in Paris.  University of Illinois  Later in 1946, Stoddard was named president of the University of Illinois. While at Illinois, he oversaw postwar expansion which included doubling the faculty and opening branch campuses in Chicago and Galesburg. His tenure was marred by left-wing student activism and disputes over academic philosophies in the economics department which led to clashes with the state's legislature. He had a falling out with the Board of Trustees over university-supported research on Krebiozon, a drug claimed to be a cancer cure. When he ordered an end to funding for the research in 1953, he lost a ‚Äúno confidence‚Äù vote with the trustees and resigned.  New York University  After leaving Illinois, Stoddard was hired by NYU to chair a self-study of the university's role in the urban community. The study led to the reorganization of the School of Education's curriculum and administration. Stoddard became dean of the department of education in 1956. In 1960 he was named chancellor and executive vice president of the university. In 1962 he opened the first center for Hebrew studies at a public university. He retired in 1964 but remained a distinguished professor of education for three years.  Long Island University  In 1967 he came out of retirement to serve as vice chancellor of LIU. His main focus was starting the university's Brooklyn center. He was promoted to chancellor and eventually retired again in 1969.  Educational views  Stoddard's first love was always elementary education. He championed departmentalized elementary education and educational technology. He also advocated the social value of play where he said, On the playing fields of America, our youth each day can learn to accept and understand racial and religious differences.  Outside of Academia  Stoddard was active in many groups outside of education. He was a member of the board of the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts. He also completed a report for the Carnegie Corporation on operations and programming for the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.  Personal life and death  Stoddard married Margaret Trautwein on December 26, 1925. They had three sons, Phillip, Arthur, and Alfred, and two daughters, Caroline and Eleanor. Stoddard died on December 28, 1981.

Established in 1982, it exhibits archaeological artifacts and ethnographic items. The museum is visited by more than 50,000 tourists yearly. Location Anasra Museum is situated on √áamlƒ±k Sok. 4 in Kum neighborhood of Amasra. History The foundation of Amasra Museum goes back to 1955 when the collected items, which were stored in a small hall in the municipality building, were opened to the public as an exhibition. In 1969, the museum moved to a former primary school building. On 30 January 1982, it was transferred to its current building. The construction of this building as a naval school began in 1884, it remained however unfinished. In 1975, the building was acquired by the Ministry of Culture and completed in 1976.

Built by Meyer Werft in Papenburg, Germany, she was delivered in October 2020, becoming the line's new flagship. At , the ship is the largest to ever operate for P&O; Cruises, and to operate specifically for the British market. She is the first of two identical ships being built by Meyer Werft for P&O; Cruises, with the second due to enter service in 2022. Design and specifications port side and sternalt=250x250px Iona has 17 different eateries, including eight restaurants designated as 'select dining', and 12 different bars. She also has 16 whirlpools and 4 swimming pools, one of which will be part of SkyDome, an entertainment venue blanketed by a 105-ton, 340-pane, 970-square-meter glass dome that also features a retractable stage for shows. SkyDome is one of 13 entertainment venues onboard. In the center of the ship there is a three-deck atrium acting as the hub for entertainment activity, while also featuring triple-deck glass panels projecting outwards for views of the outside. Powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), Iona is designed to not emit sulphur dioxide emissions and soot particles. Iona has 18 total decks, a length of , and a beam of . Maximum power is rated at . Total propulsion power is rated at . Together, the power system gives the vessel a service speed of . Iona will have a passenger capacity of 5,206 guests and 1,762 crew. Construction and career= Planning  On 6 September 2016, Carnival Corporation announced that it had signed an agreement with Meyer Werft for a 5,200-passenger vessel for P&O;, scheduled for a 2020 debut. The vessel, planned to be the largest in P&O;'s history, at approximately , would also be powered by LNG, making her the first LNG-powered ship dedicated for the British market. It was later reported that the engine room unit for the LNG tanks for Iona was constructed separately at Meyer Werft's sister yard, Neptun Werft, in Rostock. On 27 October 2016, P&O; announced that the public would be invited to name the new ship. On 24 May 2018, it was announced that the name Iona, after the Scottish island of Iona, had been chosen from 30,000 submissions.  Construction and delivery  On 25 April 2018, construction for the ship began with the steel- cutting ceremony in Papenburg. On 29 May 2019, the ship's keel was laid to mark the official assembly of the hull. At the ceremony, a bronze coin from Iona Abbey and a piece of green marble from Iona was laid under a keel block that measured long, wide, and high, and weighed . The block was then lowered into the building dock. In August 2019, the 105-ton, 340-pane glass dome that will become the ship's centerpiece was raised onto the ship. By the end of the month, the bow and midsections were joined together. Iona was floated out of the dry dock on 14 February 2020. She went through final outfitting in wet dock before her River Ems conveyance to Eemshaven on 18 March 2020 and her sea trials in the North Sea were set to follow shortly after. However, on 20 March 2020, Meyer Werft announced that the ship had been moored in Bremerhaven and all interior work and trials would be halted, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, on 26 March 2020, following discussions with Bremerhaven port and medical authorities, Meyer Werft explained that work would resume, but at a reduced pace, given the reduction in crew and resources. On 30 May 2020, Iona departed from Bremerhaven for Rotterdam for a sea trial and also to enter dry dock at Damen's Rotterdam shipyard on 2 June for continued inspection work. A second round of sea trials was later performed along the Norwegian coast following the dry dock. Originally scheduled to be delivered to P&O; in spring 2020, the ship's delivery was first postponed to June 2020, and then tentatively to August 2020, before ultimately being delivered on 9 October 2020.  Operational history  Inaugural events = Iona was originally scheduled to perform her maiden voyage on 14 May 2020. The 9-night round-trip voyage from Southampton was to sail to the Norwegian fjords, calling in Stavanger, Olden, Hellesylt, Geiranger, and Bergen, but was ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ship was also scheduled to be christened on 4 July 2020, kicking off a week-long celebration called \\"Ionafest\\" on the following seven-day voyage marking the naming of the ship. However, on 23 April 2020, after P&O; announced a further suspension of operations until 31 July 2020, it also revealed \\"Ionafest\\" would be postponed as the ship's public debut was also consequently delayed due to the pandemic. The ship's official debut is yet to be determined. = Deployments = Iona was originally scheduled to sail cruises to the Norwegian fjords from Southampton for her inaugural summer season. However, the pandemic extended the company's suspension of operations until 15 October 2020. In winter 2020, the ship is scheduled to sail round-trip itineraries from Southampton to Northern Europe, including the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium, and to Southern Europe, including the Canary Islands, Spain, and Portugal. This rotation is scheduled to continue through mid-2022.

It is owned and managed by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).  History  The Amsterdam Houses were created on land that was once tenement buildings and were created for residents to have a higher standard of living. Three playgrounds were built for children of various ages and the development housed a nursery, gymnasium, clinic and a community center. With the opening of Lincoln Center in the 1960s, the neighborhood began to gentrify and saw many older residents retaining their apartments with 70% of heads of households over the age of 62. The demographics living in this development were initially mixed, as it served to house post-war families in affordable housing. Today, mostly black families occupy the Amsterdam Houses. In 2016, NYCHA announced that a new residential tower, containing entirely affordable units, would be built on the development's open space in the center. The land would be leased to a developer, who would also operate the building, for 99 years, while the land would continue to be owned by NYCHA. After the announcement, the tenant association began working with lawyers and city-wide NYCHA residents to bring about a class action lawsuit and draft a formal response to the proposal.

They operate as a family enterprise, and have a full stake in Grupo SLC, a conglomerate of agroindustrial companies, one of them being SLC Agr√≠cola , an agricultural company and land-holding corporation with properties totalling around , which ranks the Logemann Family as the 53rd largest private landowner globally. The family, after selling their John Deere stake in 1999, heavily invested in cotton, which placed them at the very top of global production. All family members live in Porto Alegre, the capital of Brazil's southernmost state Rio Grande do Sul. According to Forbes in 2014, the family shares a 3 billion-dollar empire divided between 19 blood members. The family has kept away from media attention, valuing discretion above all else.  Business Activities The Logemann family began its business activities with Frederico Jorge Logemann, who founded Schneider & Logemann Cia LDTA. This company had a humble shop that repaired and manufactured agricultural tools for the village. Upon development, the company began producing their own threshers. Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann then took control upon his father's death, and began development of automotive harvesting machines, being the first of the Southern Hemisphere to ever produce one. Mr. Jorge Logemann then founded SLC Agr√≠cola in 1977 (now the family's main business) and in 1979 he merged SLC with John Deere for a Joint venture in Brazil. In 1987, Mr. Jorge Antonio Logemann passes away, and his two sons Eduardo and Jorge Luis took leadership of the family's businesses. In 1999, Eduardo and Jorge sold SLC & John Deere back to the John Deere group, and exited the business of tool and machine fabrication. In 2007, the family issues shares of SLC Agricola in B3 (stock exchange), which allowed SLC Agr√≠cola to become one of the 10 most important companies of Rio Grande do Sul. In 2017, the family sold one of their businesses, Ferramentas Gerias, to Grupo OVD for an undisclosed amount.  Notable Members Frederico Jorge Logemann, a German engineer from Bremen, founds the village of Belo Horizonte in 1927, today's Horizontina. In 1945 he and his partner Baldu√≠no Schneider founded Schneider & Logemann Cia LTDA, focused on the fabrication and maintenance of agricultural tools. Two years after, the company constructed its first thresher. Mr. Logemann died in 1947, after which his only son, Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann, continued his work. Zaira Logemann, who died in 2017, had been the oldest member of the family since 1987, belonging to the second generation. She was married to Jorge Antonio Logemann, the member responsible for the creation of SLC and the joint venture with John Deere in 1977. Mrs. Zaira has also been at the forefront of a construction for a new hospital wing in Porto Alegre, which now take on her name.

From around 1604 he and his brother, Georges Pauli-Stravius, studied in Rome together, where he graduated doctor of both laws in 1611 and became protonotary apostolic. While in papal service in Rome he acquired a number of absentee appointments in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, with a canonry in Tongeren from 1606 and a benefice in Borgloon from 1616. In 1618 he was appointed secretary to the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars. Pauli- Stravius returned to the Low Countries in 1624, resigning his canonry in Tongeren to take up a position as archdeacon of Arras Cathedral, becoming vicar general to Bishop Paul Boudot. Richard was ordained a priest in Li√®ge in 1631.\\"Bishop Richard Paul Stravius\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. (Self-published source).\\"Bishop Richard Pauli-Stravius\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. (Self-published source). In 1634, he was appointed Apostolic Internuncio to Flanders, the pope's interim diplomatic agent at the Brussels court in expectation of the arrival of Lelio Falconieri as nuncio. Falconieri in the event never presented his credentials, and in 1637 his appointment was rescinded, so Pauli-Stravius continued to act as the papal diplomat on the spot until after Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria's death in November 1641, when the Brussels nunciature was wound down. In 1637 he became a canon of Cambrai Cathedral, and in 1638 archdeacon of Cambrai. Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, ennobled Pauli-Stravius and his family on 18 May 1640. In 1641, both Richard and his brother Georges were nominated as auxiliary bishops to Ferdinand of Bavaria, who while ruling as prince-bishop of Li√®ge and archbishop-elector of Cologne had not himself received episcopal ordination. On 2 February 1642, Stravius was consecrated bishop of Dionysias by Jacobus Boonen, Archbishop of Mechelen, with Anthonius Triest, Bishop of Ghent, and Gaspard Nemius, Bishop of Antwerp, as co-consecrators. In 1649 he negotiated a reconciliation between Ferdinand and the city of Li√®ge at Huy. He served as auxiliary bishop of Li√®ge until his death on 24 January 1654, and was buried in the Ursuline church in Li√®ge. He left a reputation for argumentativeness and venality.

It was first developed in 1787 by Dan Johnson, one of Williston's first settlers, and has remained in his family since that time. The property includes three 19th-century houses and a large barn complex, as well as more than of land crossed by US 2 and Interstate 89. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Dan Johnson Farmstead is located in eastern Williston, with the farm building complex and associated houses located on or near US Route 2 east of Johnson Lane. The farm property consists of about , of which the majority is located south of Interstate 89 and east of South Road. The southern portion is used mainly for hay production, with the upland portions gradually reverting to forest. The area north of I-89 is used either for cultivation or as pastureland for dairy cattle. The main building complex is on the north side of US 2, and consists of a c. 1840 Greek Revival farmhouse, a series of connected barns and silos, and a toolshed. On the east side of Johnson Lane, near I-89, stands a c. 1898 farmhouse with Queen Anne features, and a third farmhouse, originally built to house tenant workers, stands at the eastern end of the farm fields on the south side of US 2. with The farm property was settled in 1787 by Dan Johnson, who was, along with members of the state's prominent Chittenden family, one of Williston's first proprietors. The Greek Revival farmhouse was probably built by Johnson's son Nathan, as were some of the surviving barns. Nathan and later his son John expanded the dairy aspect of the farm operation. The property was expanded in the 1920s by the acquisition of the Darling farm to the south, which included the c. 1898 farmhouse on Johnson Lane. I-89 was built through the property beginning in the late 1950s, complicating farm operations, since cattle could readily be driven to the southern tract. As of the farm's listing on the National Register in 1993, it was still owned by Johnson descendants.

It is one of several 3D modeling and printing applications introduced or improved with the Windows 10 Creators Update, along with View 3D, Windows Mixed Reality, Holograms, and 3D Builder. Developed by Microsoft's Lift London studio, Paint 3D incorporates features of the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to combine a lightweight hybrid 2D-3D editing experience that allows users to pull in a variety of shapes from the app, their personal computer, and Microsoft's OneDrive service.  History  In May 2016, a leaked Universal Windows Platform version of Microsoft Paint was revealed with a new hybrid ribbon-sidebar interface and some support for 3D objects. Microsoft rolled out a dummy app called Newcastle through the Windows Store to replace installations of the leaked build. In October 2016, a user on Twitter leaked out official tutorial videos of an upcoming version of Paint for Windows 10. The video showcases new features such as a completely redone interface with pen input in mind, as well as the ability to create and modify basic 3D models. The Universal Windows Platform version was officially announced and released during a Surface event on October 26, 2016 as part of the keynote presentation on the Windows 10 Creators Update. The app was made available for Windows 10 users with a build number of 14800 or higher and coexists with the previous version of Paint as of build 14955. Microsoft revealed a community website for sharing Paint drawings, with a focus on the new 3D formats. In addition to the 3D format, this version introduced the ability to save transparent pixels in 2D drawings, clip art stickers, background removal, the ability to download and import community drawings from within the app, UWP sharing contracts silhouette ribbon icons, new flat sidebar icons a blue-purple in-app theme, the ability to change the backdrop, and informational videos. One of the videos establishes unambiguously that Paint 3D is the evolution of Microsoft Paint, showing older versions of Paint from Windows editions 1, 3.1, Vista, and 10. Paint 3D was briefly made a replacement to Microsoft Paint, in Windows builds 14971 and 14986. However, due to complaints about the new interface and features missing in Paint 3D, the Windows team decided to allow the two apps to coexist. Over the course of development the stickers subsections were rearranged, new stickers were added, additional classic 2D shapes were added, an option was added to disable the welcome screen, the scrollbars were improved, the ability to resize the canvas with a mouse was added, and stickers were enabled to stick automatically if the user switched to a different activity without clicking the stamp button. Windows Insider chief Dona Sarkar confirmed that a Windows 10 Mobile version of Paint 3D has entered the alpha stage of development. In the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update an updated version of Paint 3D was released in Windows Store. It allowed users to directly Upload or Download models from Remix 3D. Screenshot of Paint 3D showing off 2D and 3D features. Paint 3D's most heavily promoted features are related to its support for 3D objects. Paint 3D provides 3D stock people, animals, geometric shapes, text, and doodles. Users can rotate objects, adjust the placement of 3D object in all three dimensions, and apply 2D objects as stickers to 3D objects. The canvas itself can be rotated in 3D space or hidden, but it cannot be rotated while the user is editing. It includes many of the 2D objects from Microsoft Paint and new colorful \\"stickers\\", which are functionally similar to traditional 2D shapes, and patterns that can be applied to the background and 3D objects. 2D text is available, as well as 3D text. Animations can be saved in 2D and 3D formats and shared using the Windows Share feature or OneDrive (purposed as a user- generated warehouse, replacing Remix3d.com). Because of these features, Microsoft included a license agreement that appears when the app is launched. The user is greeted with a welcome screen with tutorials, information about Paint 3D, and options for opening or starting a project. The screen can be disabled and reenabled. Like its predecessor, Paint 3D supports multiwindowing. Both support jumplists, but only Paint 3D displays 3D objects in its jumplist (other picture types are permissible).  Reception  Paint 3D was praised for the new features it introduced, its role in Windows 10's evolving 3D support, the new user interface, improved stylus support, and a level of innovation not seen in the development of Microsoft Paint. The app has gone on to be used in peripheral gaming, finding a niche in game design as well as general gameplay. However, users criticized it on the Internet and in the Feedback Hub for lacking some of the features of Microsoft Paint, lack of available 3D tools, and not being as ergonomically intuitive with a mouse and keyboard, particularly in the earliest iterations of the app.  Controversy  It was found that the software deleted the 3D and 2D projects automatically, the reason is still unknown.

The project consists of fifteen buildings, 9, 10 and 14-stories tall with 1,350 apartment units. It covers a 17.72-acre expanse, and is bordered by East 163rd and East 166th Streets, and Trinity and Tinton Avenues. It is owned and managed by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).  Development  Plans for the Forest Houses began in 1949 with securing the funds from the federal government. NYCHA officials stated that the housing program is primarily a slum clearance program and they intend the finished development to provide better living conditions and a walkable community for the residents. During demolition of the slums, the area was likened to a \\"bomb blast scene\\" and held a defense test on the site. The development's design incorporated well-received modern features at the Carver Houses, including compact kitchens, electric ranges, and a refrigerator with freezer. NYCHA publicized that the tenants would be 58% Black and 42% non-Black, most of which were Puerto Rican. The Forest Houses were completed on November 12, 1956. In 2013, Forest Houses residents worked with artist Thomas Hirschhorn to a space to encourage the exchange between people, ideas and communities in the form of a pavilion. Also that year, NYCHA and Mayor Bloomberg sold a portion of the development's property for the addition of a new privately owned building to offset the agency's capital needs. The eight-story LEED-certified building was designated for low- income households earning less than 60 percent of the area median income and cost approximately $37.7 million to build.

A flamboyant character, commonly known as the Midnight Cowboy, Rodgers worked part-time as a musician for most of his lifetime. He recorded two albums in the 1990s. In his lengthy career, Rodgers variously performed with Carey Bell, Junior Wells, Billy Boy Arnold, Raful Neal, Kenny Neal, Little Walter, Phillip Walker, T-Bone Walker, Little Milton, Cab Calloway, Charles Brown, Boxcar Willie, Rose Maddox, Mickey Gilley, Willie Nelson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Sonny Rhodes, and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards. Rodgers also appeared on television programs, including the Gong Show, You Bet Your Life, and Good Morning America. Biography Rodgers was born near to Liberty, Mississippi, one of eighteen children in his family. His parents were sharecroppers. He left home at the age of 12 and drifted from one job to another. His cousins, Sonny Boy Williamson II and Bo Diddley, inspired him to become a musician. He found full-time employment as a boxer, truck driver, cotton picker and ranch hand. In the latter capacity he acquired the nickname Midnight Cowboy from his boss in Dorris, California, after Rodgers delivered a calf in the dead of the night. When times became particularly difficult, Rodgers resorted to stealing chickens, later recalled in the title of his album Chicken Thief Blues. His vagrant life gave him a wealth of stories, which he retold both in his music and between songs at the impromptu concerts he gave. He recalled being a cotton picker alongside Bo Diddley, wrestling a bear, placing a defanged rattlesnake in his father's bed, and meeting B.B. King. Rodgers appeared on the television program The Gong Show in 1976 and 1977 (he won on both occasions), on Bill Cosby's version of You Bet Your Life (1992), and on Good Morning America. In 1994, Rodgers was given the Humanitarian Award by the Southern California Motion Picture Awards in Oakland, California. He also agreed to the use of his nickname in Midnight Cowboy, the 1969 film starring Dustin Hoffman, and his music was used in the film The Big Easy (1987). By the late 1980s, Rodgers was able to have a full- time career in music. He recorded released two albums, Freight Train Blues (1992) and Chicken Thief Blues (1995), released by Snowflake Records, '. In his time he performed with Carey Bell, Junior Wells, Billy Boy Arnold, Raful Neal, Kenny Neal, Little Walter, Phillip Walker, T-Bone Walker, Little Milton, Cab Calloway, Charles Brown, Boxcar Willie, Rose Maddox, Mickey Gilley, Willie Nelson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Sonny Rhodes, and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards. Known for his Piedmont blues style of finger-picking the guitar, Rodgers also played the harmonica in a Delta blues style. He was later known to musicians as the \\"Grand Daddy of the Blues\\". He was inducted into the Cowboy Blues Hall of Fame in Nevada City, California. He also played for President Gerald Ford at the Hilton in Fresno, California. His hay haulage business was primarily based in Fresno County, California and, later, in Butte Valley and Gridley, where he lived for more than 50 years. A fire at his mobile home forced Rodgers and his longtime companion, Georgie Ann Wadell, to relocate to Fall River Mills, where they lived until his death. The fire destroyed much of his archived music, biography and genealogy research. Rodgers died of complications due to diabetes in August 2004, at the age of 82, in Redding, Shasta County, California.

Early life  Saul was born in Tanzania where his parents taught and studied at the University of East Africa in Dar es Salaam, and were active in the liberation struggles of the Southern African states. The family moved back to Canada in 1972. Saul completed his undergraduate studies in history at University of Toronto and his master's studies in sociology at Warwick University in the UK, where he was a Commonwealth Scholar.  Career  After graduating in 1993, Saul became a community organizer, working with public housing tenants in Alexandra Park (the first conversion of a public housing community into a co-operative in Canada) and homeless men on the east side of Toronto. In 1998, Saul became Executive Director of The Stop Community Food Centre. During his tenure at the organization, he and staff transformed it from a small, under-resourced food bank to a thriving, internationally respected Community Food Centre offering programs in the areas of food access, food skills, and education and engagement. In September 2012, Saul left The Stop with a group of colleagues to launch Community Food Centres Canada (CFCC). CFCC is a national organization that provides resources to partner organizations across Canada to establish Community Food Centres. Community Food Centres provide access to healthy food, food skills, community gardening, and policy advocacy for greater equity and justice. As of June 2020, there are thirteen Community Food Centres across Canada in Toronto, Perth, Stratford, Winnipeg, Dartmouth, Calgary, Hamilton., Eel Ground First Nation, Montreal, Kamloops, Nelson, Iqaluit, and Birch Lake. CFCC also works with organizations within the broader food movement to advocate for a fair food system.

The book was also published by Melville House in the U.S. The book details how Saul transformed The Stop from a food bank to a community hub, and how this transformation became the catalyst for a national Community Food Centre program. Saul and Curtis use this experience to argue the need for an overhaul of the food charity system to one rooted in food justice that empowers low- income communities.

Life Anne-Marie Wever's father, Walther Wever, was a diplomat and her childhood was correspondingly peripatetic. She was born in Paris and grew up successively in Bulgaria, Romania, Brazil and the United States. She had a younger sister and a brother who died in infancy. Her mother, born Anne- Marie von Harbou, is also known to have suffered two late-stage miscarriages. Anne-Marie Wever later recalled of her childhood that most of her early memories involved not her mother but her father, because of her mother's poor health. Until she was 10 she was \\"home-schooled\\". She attended school in Chicago, completing her studies at the University School for Girls in 1907 before moving on to study Chemistry. She received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Chicago in 1910. Between 1910 and 1915 she studied medicine at Marburg, Stra√üburg and Munich, passing her state exams on 30 May 1915 and receiving her medical doctorate in 1917, ten days before the birth of her first child. She then worked as an assistant doctor at the Munich University Women's Clinic (and elsewhere), specialising in gynaecology. On 30 December 1916 Anne-Marie Wever married Wilhelm Durand, an architect. Their children, Ernst-August and Anne-Marie, were born in Munich, respectively in 1917 and 1924. A rumour exists that Durand-Wever suffered hearing difficulties following the birth of herr first child, and that her hearing was liable to be further damaged through further pregnancies, which gave her a personal interest in pregnancy prevention. Throughout the 1920s Durand-Wever was active in women's organisations. In Munich she had already founded, and during the First World War chaired, the regional grouping of Women Doctors Associations (\\"Landesgruppe Bayern des deutschen √Ñrztinnenbundes\\"). In 1927 she set up he own medical practice in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg. That same year she opened a \\"Confidential Centre for engaged and married people\\" (\\"Vertrauenstelle f√ºr Verlobte und Eheleute\\") and became increasingly prominent as an advocate of improved sex education for girls. The context was one in which each year, during the 1920s and 1930s, approximately 10,000 women were dying in Germany as a result of illegal abortions. Towards the end of the 1920s she formed a friendship with Margaret Sanger, a \\"founder of the birth control movement\\" in the United States. During this time she was also collaborating with the feminist journalist Ilse Reicke on \\"Mutter- und Kinderland\\", a magazine targeting mothers. In 1930 she was one of 356 doctors who signed a submission to the sentencing committee of the Reichstag calling for a reform of ¬ß218 (the abortion section) of the criminal code. The political backdrop changed dramatically in January 1933 when the Nazi party seized power and lost no time in converting Germany into a one- party dictatorship. Anne-Marie Durand-Wever was excluded from the Reichsschrifttumskammer because of her contrarian views on \\"social hygiene\\" and education. She later recalled that she was forbidden to publish. In 1938 several of her books, covering themes such as sex education, birth control and contraception appeared on the official list of damaging and undesirable publications. Nevertheless, as early as 1933 her publisher reissued her booklet \\"Pregnancy Prevention\\" (\\"Verh√ºtung der Schwangerschaft\\"): the text was unchanged, but the title had been changed to \\"Race hygiene, sterilisation and descendant restriction\\" (\\"Rassenhygiene, Sterilisation und Nachkommensbeschr√§nkung\\"). According to one source the Office for Public Health withdrew her authorisation on 12 October 1937. She nevertheless remained in Germany, sustained her private medical practice and continued to provide birth-control advice. War ended in May 1945 together with the Nazi regime and Durand-Wever resumed her public role. She chaired the committee that prepared the way for the foundation of the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD), which was formally established in March 1947. With what remained of Germany divided into four military occupation zones the DFD was apparently viewed with equanimity or favour by all the occupying powers, and she held high office within it. Increasingly, however, it became a creature of the newly formed ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) in the Soviet occupation zone (after 1949 East Germany): it was subsequently banned entirely in what became, after 1949, West Germany. In 1949 or early 1950 Durand-Wever resigned all her offices with the DFD on grounds of overwork and health, and later in 1950 she left the organisation. At the end of 1952 she was a co-founder in Kassel of the \\"German Society for family planning and sex education and counselling\\" (\\"Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Familienplanung, Sexualp√§dagogik und Sexualberatung\\" - also known as \\"Pro Familia\\"), serving as its deputy chair. In addition she worked for its international counterpart, the International Planned Parenthood Federation. During her final years Anne-Marie Durand-Wever continued to live in West Berlin. However, when she died on 14 September 1970 it was at her son's home in Overath-Heiligenhaus, just outside Cologne on its eastern side.

History  Southern Christian College has its story of origin, the people or circumstances that launched it, and who's who managed its course thereafter. Through evolutionary development ‚Äî the original concept of SCC as a Protestant school was shaped and reshaped into an organic collection of traditions and distinctive ways. Rev. Proculo Rodriguez of Siliman University visited Midsayap in 1937. He met Mr. Bibiano Qui√±ones and Mr. and Mrs. Fernando dela Serna and they struck the spark of putting up a Protestant school in Mindanao. The idea was nurtured; however, the dream did not come true even though Maguindanao Institute was opened in June 1941. Maguindanao Institute was registered as non-sectarian, a stock corporation with 37 stockholders. Mr. Qui√±ones, with more than half of the shares of stock of Maguindanao Institute, offered to donate his shares of stock to the new school. This kind of gesture was influential in the decision of choosing Midsayap as the site of Southern Christian College. The Cotabato and Davao Conferences bought the present site from the stockholders of the defunct Maguindanao Institute that dissolved itself and paved the way for the new Christian school, Southern Christian College (SCC). The members of the women's organization of both conferences raised initial contribution, cash or in-kind, to start the school's operation. SCC was established as a non-stock, non-profit religious educational institution in 1949. It was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an educational arm of United Church of Christ in the Philippines. the original incorporators, who also composed the first Board of Trustees, were: Atty. Florentino L. Martinez, Mr. Claudio P. Fajardo, Rev.Elton Brown, Mr. Clemente Dimafeliz, Dr. Samuel Royola, Rev. Manuel J. Villanueva, Mr. Fernando dela Cerna, Mr. Bibiano Qui√±ones, Mr. Juan Cruzado, and Mr. Emilio Albarico. Since its foundation, Church Workers, either layperson or minister has administered Southern Christian College. Atty. Florentino L. Martinez served the SCC in 1949 to the 1950; Rev. Angel J. Alvaro, 1950‚Äì53; Prof. Guillermo Magdamo, 1953-1960; Bishop Proculo ROdriguez; 1960‚Äì63; Dr. Eliezer D. Mapanao (1965-1987); Dr. Filemon L. Lagon (1987-1994); Dr. Eliezer D. Mapanao (1994-1997); and Dr. Erlinda N. Senturias (1997- May 31, 2007). Dr. Senturias was SCC's first Woman College President and her servant leadership was guided with the mission that ‚ÄúSCC commits itself to the education of persons to understand and live God¬¥s will in all areas in life.‚Äù The principles includes quality education that is contextualized, liberating, empowering, relevant, people as subjects of education, responsive to the needs of people, faith-rooted and grounded ecumenical, and critical and analytical processes. SCC embarked on auxiliary programs that will provide financial under girding to continue SCC's vision-mission in education. The SCC Feedmill that seeks to provide accessible, available and affordable livestock, feeds, was started by Rev. John Beran, a fraternal worker from the united Presbyterian Church in the USA. It was recently registered as Saranay Feeds, Product of SCC, Pride of Cotabato. The future of SCC lies in the purpose of God, the dedication and devotion of the newly installed President of the College, the Rev. Dr. Melanio L. Aoanan. Dr. Aoanan is a minister of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, an author, researcher and professor of Philosophy, Ethics, Religion, and Theology. He taught in several colleges and universities such as Silliman University, Philippine Christian University, De La Salle University, and Union Theological Seminary. Dr. Aoanan is not new to Southern Christian Colleges. He had spent thirteen prolific years at the College where he was a Director of Religious Studies from 1973 to 1975; Chaplain and Dean of the College of Theology from 1982 to 1988; and an Executive officer for Spiritual Life and values Formation from 1988 to 1995. As new leader of SCC, he campaigns for the continuity of the previous leadership's plan of pursuing for the university status for the college; for the generation of enough resources to support the Colleges program through the establishment of endowed professional chairs; for the strengthening of relationship and linkages with other academics institutions and partner organizations; for the pursuit of the teaching faculty to engage in the complete postgraduate studies; for the promotion of a culture of research and publications for both teaching and nonteaching personnel ; for the implementation of strategies for an aggressive student recruitment; and for taping the goodwill and support of thousands of alumni and friends of the College.

In 1957, she became the first Ethiopian woman elected to Parliament. Early life and resistance Gebru was born on 13 January 1916 in Menagesha. Her father, Gebru Desta, was a European-educated writer and former mayor of Addis Ababa and briefly president of the senate. Her mother, Weyzero Kasaye Yelamtu, was an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian and raised her in the faith. She was educated locally at the Swedish Mission School before being sent to Switzerland in 1928 for higher studies. She did not like the school, so she was sent to a school in France, where she learned French and English. She also discovered a love for literature, and earned a degree in the subject at Lausanne University in Switzerland. In 1932, she moved back to Ethiopia to find a position as a teacher at the St. George School in Addis Ababa and married for the first time. In addition to teaching, she interpreted for foreign journalists. Gebru became politically active in the 1930s resisting the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. Along with her brothers, she was involved in the opposition movement led by Haile Selassie. She moved to Gor√© in Illubabor Province, where she joined with 100 cadets from a military academy and received some military training. Her group traveled to Neqemte, where she tried to arouse resistance to the Italians and was nearly captured. Gebru moved back to Gor√©, where she joined the Black Lions and established a Red Cross Unit after receiving some medical training. Gebru served as an informant for the Black Lions about Italian troop movements. Eventually, after catching pneumonia, she was captured by the Italians and interrogated. Meanwhile, her brother was killed on 19 February 1937. She later wrote a play about this event. Her rebellious behavior resulted in her being imprisoned on the Italian island of Asinara along with her father and sister. She was repatriated to Ethiopia in 1939. Literary and political career After Gebru returned to Ethiopia, she found a job at the Weyzero Sih√Øn school in Des√© in 1941. Gebru was appointed assistant director of the first girls' school in Ethiopia, the Empress Etege School, in 1943. She became headmistress two years later, a first in Ethiopian history. She instituted a number of innovations, such as taking girls for picnics on Mount Intoto and having them perform plays she wrote to enhance their public speaking abilities. She was a writer in the Amharic language, and in 1956 published a collection of short stories, songs and poems entitled YaLebbe Meshaf (Book of My Heart). This was the only book she would write, although she produced a number of popular plays such as Keyekketit quenoch (Days in February). The following year, she was elected to the Parliament of Ethiopia, the first woman to do so. She was named vice president of the Chamber of Deputies on 22 November. She advocated complete parity between men and women and institution of the Civil Code. She served four years in Parliament and tried to end flogging of criminals, although this met some resistance. After her stint in Parliament, Gebru served in a number of important positions, such as the leader of the Ethiopian Red Cross and secretary-general of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Later life Gebru was married three times. Her third husband, Aseffa Lemma, was appointed ambassador to Germany in 1968. She followed him to Bonn as an educational attache. The outbreak of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1974 caused him to seek exile there, but she returned to Ethiopia. She continued to write, and donated some plays to the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the Addis Ababa University. Gebru was a regular contributor to the \\"women's column\\" in the Amharic newspaper Addis Zemen. Her son, Samuel Assefa, was ambassador to the United States. Gebru died on 20 April 2009.

Singer Elvis Presley lived here with his parents between March 1956 and March 1957, before moving to Graceland. About the house The house is a one-story ranch-style house with concrete foundation and two-car attached garage. It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood. It has four bedrooms and two bathrooms. A brick and metal fence was installed by the Presley family. In the backyard is a motorcycle garage. Elvis installed a pool in the backyard in 1956, which was reported to be the largest residential pool in the city at the time. The pool was removed in 2006. Originally the house was painted green, then white, then green again. History House with mailbox Elvis purchased the house on March 12, 1956 for $29,500 from the Welsh Plywood Corporation. Elvis placed a down-payment of $500 on the house. He was 21 years old. The new home was not far from his previous residence at 1414 Getwell Road. Shortly after moving there, Elvis' song Heartbreak Hotel became the most popular song in the nation, and fans mobbed the house. The house quickly became a focal point for fans, media and celebrities to visit. Photos of the house were published in national magazines such as Look, Seventeen, and Parade. Police frequently were called to deal with the mobs of fans who would line the street. The crush of fans and photographers became too much, and after 13 months Elvis moved to Graceland. Elvis sold the Audubon Drive property as part of the purchase of Graceland. Elvis and Graceland owner Ruth Moore swapped residences; Ruth moved into the Audubon home as Elvis moved into Graceland. The property has been sold about eight times since. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 2006, shortly before its public auction on eBay. The house was put up for sale via eBay auction in May 2006. Initially, it was reported that 'spoon-bender' Uri Geller won the auction with a bid of $905,100. Instead, the house was sold to record company executive Mike Curb at a reported sale price of $1 million. Curb turned oversight of the property over to the Mike Curb Institute at Rhodes College. The new owners repainted the house from white to a green color similar to the one when Elvis owned it, renovated the fence, and removed the pool.

It served during the London Blitz, landed on D-Day, seeing action throughout the campaign in North West Europe and defending the cities of Belgium against V-1 flying bombs. Origin The regiment was formed on 27 February 1941 as part of the rapid expansion of Britain's Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences. It was organised as follows:Frederick, pp. 803‚Äì4, 807, 832.Farndale, Annex M.73 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. * 218 LAA Battery formed at 208th LAA Training Rgt at Yeovil from a cadre supplied by 34th LAA Rgt * 220 LAA Battery formed at 212th LAA Training Rgt at Saighton Camp from a cadre supplied by 17th LAA Rgt * 221 LAA Battery formed at 212th LAA Training Rgt at Saighton from a cadre supplied by 45th LAA Rgt The three batteries were all formed on 12 December 1940 and regimented on 10 March 1941. The regiment was assigned to 49th AA Brigade in 1st AA Division. This formed part of the London Inner Artillery Zone defending against the continuing Blitz.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. A number of officers, including the Commanding Officer (CO), Lieutenant-Colonel John Anderson Armstrong, and the adjutant, Captain Sir Charles Shuckburgh, Bt, came to the regiment from the 11th (City of London Yeomanry) LAA Rgt within 49th AA Bde.Monthly Army List May 1939.73 LAA Rgt War Diary 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/2746. The Blitz RHQ was established at Sunningdale, soon afterwards moving to Stanwell. The three newly formed batteries were still training at LAA Practice Camps at Watchet (218 Bty) and Stiffkey (220 and 221 Btys). As they arrived they took over defence of Vulnerable Points (VPs) west of London: 218 Bty at Langley with eight Bofors 40 mm guns and at Surbiton with 12 Lewis guns; 220 Bty at Neasden (2 x Bofors), Hendon (2 x Bofors) and Northolt (8 x Bofors); 221 at Hatfield and Radlett. Most of these VPs were related to airfields and/or aircraft factories. Later some of these VPs were given up to other units and the regiment took over protection of vital waterworks at Hampton, Walton-on-Thames and Kempton Park. The regiment fired its first shots (at a passing Dornier Do 17 bomber) on 12 March. That month the regiment provided a number of volunteers and Bofors guns to provide AA cover aboard Merchant Navy ships. It was still receiving recruits from the training regiments ‚Äì three whole Troops (providing a fourth Troop for each Battery: D, H and L) arrived from Stiffkey in early May ‚Äì and further training was carried out at the batteries by instructors from 11th (CoLY) LAA Rgt. More sites were given Bofors guns, and during May some of the static guns were converted to semi-mobile status by mounting them on travelling carriages. Also that month, 123rd Z Battery was temporarily attached to the regiment and took over some VPs with its rocket launchers. In September 1941 the regiment provided a cadre of experienced men to provide the basis of a new 296th LAA Bty formed by 208th LAA Training Regiment at Yeovil. In November this battery joined the regiment, replacing 221st Bty, which was transferred to a newly formed 97th LAA Rgt in 65th AA Brigade.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. Mobile training In March 1942 the fourth Troop of each Battery was removed and constituted into a new 466th LAA Bty; this was mainly composed of men of low medical categories. 466th Battery remained regimented with 73rd LAA until July, when it was transferred to a new 141st LAA Rgt. On 14 August 1942, 73rd LAA Rgt handed over its responsibilities to 62nd LAA Rgt. It left 49th AA Bde and moved to Ampthill for a month's battle training, followed by a further month's mobile training at Leigh-on-Sea.73 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7662.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. In November, after completion of this training, 73rd LAA Rgt was assigned to 71st AA Brigade in Kent, where it deployed to some of the most heavily-attacked towns in the UK: 218 Bty at Dover, 221 Bty at Minster-in- Thanet, and 296 Bty at Deal, with RHQ at Shepherdswell. Anti-Aircraft Command had been increasing the LAA cover of the South Coast of England since the Luftwaffe began a campaign of 'hit and run' raids by fighter-bombers earlier in the year. Engagements between the regiment's guns and these raiders were frequent, with casualties on both sides. 218 Bty also suffered 11 men killed on 9 November when Dover was shelled by German cross-Channel guns.Routledge, pp. 401‚Äì5. Bofors 40 mm LAA gun equipped with 'Stiffkey Stick' sights On 10 December 1942, 73rd LAA Rgt was withdrawn from AA Command and joined Home Forces for advanced mobile training, which began round Ramsgate. As a mobile unit, it consisted of three Batteries, each composed of three Troops equipped with six towed Bofors guns using 'Stiffkey Stick' sights. It also had its own Royal Corps of Signals signal section and a Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop, which joined in January 1943.73 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/11707.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA file WO 212/9 .Routledge, p. 306. Training for Overlord At the end of January 1943, while still at Ramsgate, the regiment deployed in the semi- mobile role for 'Duckshooting' against the continuing 'hit and run' raids. On 20 February, it moved to Evans Lines at Blandford Camp, where it joined 76th AA Bde but transferred to 80th AA Bde when it was formed at Blandford in April. Both 76th and 80th AA Bdes were assigned to Second Army for the planned invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord).76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11247.80 AA Bde War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11248. The regiment moved its base to Ardrossan in Scotland in mid-May, but during the spring and summer of 1943 the unit took part in practice camps in various parts of the country and in training exercises simulating assault landings on a hostile shore. 220 Bty trained with No 6 Beach Group and 103rd Heavy AA Rgt, with which it would land on D-Day.103 HAA Rgt War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11586.103 HAA Rgt War Diary, January‚ÄìMay 1944, TNA file WO 166/14783.80 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. When not training, the mobile regiments could be deployed to assist AA Command. In late August, on completion of a beach landing exercise in Pembrokeshire, 73rd LAA Rgt was attached to 5th AA Bde at Eastbourne, Brighton, Pevensey and Seaford, East Sussex on the South Coast, which was still subject to 'hit and run' attacks by the Luftwaffe. During the winter of 1943‚Äì44 the regiment was stationed in Ross and Cromarty and Morayshire in Scotland, with RHQ at Gordon Castle. Crusader AA Mark I SP Bofors gun In February 1944, the regiment received six Crusader AA Mark I tracked self-propelled (SP) Bofors guns, which would have a special role in the assault landing on D-Day. The following month it collected 24 SP Bofors (on Morris C9B 4 x 4 lorries).73 LAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1121.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì10.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. Training continued through early 1944, with the regiment visiting No 16 AA Practice Camp at Clacton-on-Sea before moving to Slinfold in West Sussex. In May, the units of 80th AA Bde went to their marshalling areas to embark for the invasion. The assault elements of the regiment embarked at Portsmouth, the rear echelons at Tilbury. D-Day For the Normandy landings, 80th AA Bde was assigned to support I Corps landing on Juno and Sword. The leading elements were to land with the assault waves on D-Day itself (6 June). Light AA defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat and the designated assault regiments landed with minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties arriving later. The leading units were formed into AA Assault Groups, and Lt-Col Armstrong with RHQ of 73rd LAA Rgt took charge of 'M' AA Assault Group landing on Queen Beach of Sword under the command of 3rd Division. The assault group included elements of 103rd HAA Rgt equipped with towed 3.7-inch guns and 93rd LAA Rgt equipped with the new 20 mm Polsten gun in triple mountings, half of them mounted on Crusader tank chassis.Joslen, p. 583.'M' & 'N' Assault Groups Operation Order No 1, 103 HAA and 73 LAA Rgt War Diaries, May 1944, TNA files WO 166/14783 and WO 171/1121.

One troop of 296/73 LAA Bty was assigned to 'P' AA Assault Group on Juno Beach, the other was held in reserve in England. The brigade experienced considerable problems during the landings, with losses of landing craft and hard fire-fights going on to establish a firm hold. A and C Troops of 218th Bty, less two guns each, landed at Queen White and Queen Red respectively, 45 minutes after H-Hour, when the beach was still under heavy fire. The Battery and A Troop commanders and the regimental medical officer were all wounded but carried on. The remaining guns of these Troops were landed, and the whole battery was in position five hours after H-Hour. By then, Lt-Col Armstrong had arrived and set up the AA command post on the beach. 220th Battery arrived late, found its intended positions to be still in enemy hands and could not begin landing until the following day (D+1) on Juno beach. Some of the AA gun detachments already ashore on Sword were involved in 'mopping up' isolated German strongpoints. Total casualties for the regiment on D-Day were one officer wounded and evacuated, one other rank killed, five wounded and one missing. Communication problems meant that 73rd LAA Rgt remained out of contact with 80th AA Bde HQ until D+1. Luckily, Luftwaffe attacks on D-Day were few and sporadic, only increasing on D+1, by which time more guns of 73rd LAA Rgt had got ashore. The air attacks peaked on D+3. B Troop of 218 Bty landed 38 hours late, at 0600 on D+2, and deployed at Ouistreham. This troop, together with B Troop of 322/103 HAA Bty, had a secondary coastal artillery role to protect shipping off Queen from attack by German E-boats, particularly at night. For this purpose 16 Fire Control Post and 76 and 103 Coast Observer detachments were landed with it, under command of 103rd HAA Rgt. The guns would fire blind, controlled by radar, or with the assistance of searchlights. Normandy Once ashore the AA Assault Groups reorganised into temporary regimental groups, with regimental commanders acting as AA Defence Commanders (AADCs) in their immediate areas. Lieutenant-Colonel Armstrong was designated Commander, LAA Defence and Smoke, for 101 Beach SubArea, which controlled the landings and beach exits for Sword.Armstrong's citation, TNA file WO 373/83/74.

Armstrong was later awarded an OBE for his work during this period. As the build-up in the Normandy beachhead grew during June and July 1944, 80 AA Bde was tasked with protecting Juno and Sword, the small port of Ouistreham, and the River Orne and Caen Canal bridges. 73rd LAA Regiment was deployed round Sword, which remained under German shellfire and night bombing. Some of 63/20 LAA Bty's crews were washed off their Gooseberries and the blockship Courbet during the storm of 19/20 June, and they were sent to reinforce 73rd LAA Rgt. Other AA batteries arriving from the UK were temporarily attached to RHQ until their own regiments arrived. 322 Bty of 93rd LAA Rgt, with its Crusader-mounted triple 20mm guns remained with 73rd LAA Rgt guarding the Orne and Caen Canal bridges until mid-July. The rest of 296th Bty finally arrived on 20 July and went to thicken up the defences of Sword. By 13 August, the LAA beach defences could be reduced and the whole of 73rd LAA Rgt redeployed to the Caen Canal, with Lt-Col Armstrong appointed AADC Canal Zone.Routledge, pp. 308‚Äì15; Table XLIX, p. 319. At the end of August, 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. 73rd LAA Regiment reverted to mobile operations, with two towed and one SP battery, supported by the 30 three-tonner lorries of 1573 Platoon Royal Army Service Corps (RASC). On 3 September the regiment was ordered to guard the crossings of the River Seine, with one battery at Les Andelys and two at Louviers, where 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division had crossed on 28 August and the engineers had established Bailey bridges.Routledge, Tables L & LI, pp. 327‚Äì8.Ellis, pp. 466‚Äì7.Martin, pp. 112‚Äì8. I Corps captured Le Havre during Operation Astonia on 10‚Äì12 September, and 73rd LAA Rgt joined the AA defences of the town on 22 September, where it came under operational command of 103rd AA Bde.Routledge, Table LI, p. 329. The regiment's own transport platoon and 1573 Pln RASC then returned to help move up 4th Royal Marines LAA Rgt, which had just landed at Cherbourg, driving 1000 miles in total. Belgium V-1 in flight over Antwerp 73rd LAA Regiment was withdrawn from Le Havre on 14 October and moved to Antwerp where it reverted to 80 AA Bde command once more. Clearing the Scheldt Estuary and bringing the port of Antwerp into use as a supply base was an important element in the Overlord plan. To deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers'), the planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) integrated into a system ('Antwerp X' ) of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. 73rd LAA Regiment was deployed and ready for action in the 'Antwerp X' belt on 17 October. Diver attacks began on 21 October against Brussels, and the first arrived at Antwerp two days later. At Antwerp the regiment was under the operational control of the US 56th AA Artillery Brigade.Routledge, pp. 322; Tables LI & LII, pp. 329‚Äì31; p 333. Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. 73rd LAA Rgt moved to join the 'Brussels X' defences on 5 November under the operational command of 101st AA Brigade while 80th AA Bde operated the early warning radar system. 220/73 Battery was detached and joined 75th AA Brigade at Ostend on 15 November. Here the threat was not from air raids, but E-boats attacking shipping in the anchorage. 218th and 220th Batteries later moved up the southern side of the Scheldt Estuary under 5th Royal Marine AA Brigade in December, becoming part of the defences against aircraft dropping Parachute mines in the approaches to Antwerp Docks and the Ghent canal. With 296th Battery returning to the Antwerp X defences, and the REME Workshop at the Scheldt, RHQ ended the year with no units under its direct command.Routledge, p. 326, 335‚Äì8; Table LII, p. 331; Table LIII, p. 342. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte: daylight attacks by single-engined fighters against Allied airfields and lines of communication in support of the Ardennes offensive. 220th Battery was in the middle of a move to Knokke and only had five guns deployed, but claimed five Category I 'kills', and the Battery HQ of 296th Bty claimed another with Bren gun fire; 218th Bty were awarded a Category II claim.Routledge, pp. 346‚Äì7.73 LAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4947. RHQ and 296th Bty rejoined 220th Bty at Knokke under 75th AA Bde in early January; 218th Bty remained detached under 5th RM AA Bde.103 HAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4912. On 12 March 1945 Lt-Col Armstrong relinquished command of the regiment after four years and the second-in-command, Major C.J. Lemon, was promoted to replace him. Disbandment As the Allied forces advanced into Germany the air threat dwindled. 73rd LAA Regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and on 17 April the batteries were relieved of their commitments and the regiment concentrated south of Bruges. It was ordered to disband on 3 May and men and equipment began to be dispersed to other units; final disbandment was completed on 16 June 1945.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366.

He was the first African-American to run for Governor of North Carolina. He fought to desegregate Charlotte schools and businesses. His son-in-law was Hamaas Abdul Khaalis whose family was murdered in 1973 and who went on to commit the 1977 Hanafi Siege. Reginald Hawkins was born in Beaufort, North Carolina, in 1923. He served as captain in the US Army during World War II. After completing his time in the service, he attended Howard University, where he got his degree in dentistry in 1948. He also received his MA of Divinity from Johnson C Smith University in 1973. He married Catherine Richardson while he was still in dental school and they had four children. Civil rights advocacy Hawkins and members of the NAACP differed over the best way to end school desegregation. Kelly Alexander wanted to sue the city of Charlotte over civil injustice. Hawkins believed that a confrontational approach was best through utilizing media coverage to help mobilize citizens, arguing \\"The only way to move forward is to engage bigots in direct controversy within their own community. In order to make his point about the only way to move forward, Hawkins escorted Dorthy Counts, a young black girl to Harding High School, a white school in Charlotte. On September 4, 1957 Hawkins and Counts walked through a shower of spit and insults to integrate the first Mecklenburg County School. His actions that day created a lot of stir in both the white and African-American neighborhoods, creating a national name for Hawkins. From then on Hawkins became a prominent civil rights activist in Charlotte. In 1961 Hawkins led a boycott of Irwin Avenue Junior High School. He urged African-American students to stay home instead of attending a second-rate educational institution. Due to his disagreement with NAACP policies and in an attempt to distance himself from their \\"communist\\" label, Hawkins resigned his membership in 1958 and created the Mecklenburg Organization for Political Affairs (MOPA). MOPA used community activists within the African-American community to call for desegregation. Members took part in marches, picketing, protests, boycotts, and sit-in's, usually near schools or hospitals in the Charlotte area. Hawkins work helped successfully integrate many restaurants downtown including those in Belk's and Ivey's department stores. In 1962 Hawkins filed suit against the North Carolina Dental Society for discrimination due to the fact they would not let him practice at Charlotte Memorial Hospital. He frequently led demonstrations outside the Mercy, Charlotte Memorial, Presbyterian and Good Samaritan hospitals in the Charlotte area. These demonstrations usually attracted a lot of press and generated controversy in the medical community. Hawkins continued to protest by writing Attorney General Robert Kennedy claiming that the hospitals were breaking their nondiscrimination policy that was one of the conditions of them receiving federal funding. By the end of 1962 the Department of Health ordered Memorial to desegregate their maternity and dentistry wards. Hawkins continued to protest until 1963 when the hospital declared an open-door policy for all patients. On November 22, 1965 four bombs exploded across Charlotte in the span of about 15 minutes. Hawkins' home was hit as well as the homes of Kelly Alexander Sr, president of the NAACP, Fred Alexander, first African American City Council man, and Julius Chambers, a civil rights lawyer. The bombings caught the attention of the local news and put Charlotte into the violent category that cities like Birmingham and Jackson had already been placed in. No one was ever arrested for the bombings even though there was a statewide manhunt, and the FBI still holds an open file on the event. Many people believe the bombings were resistance to efforts of desegregation that all four men were part of. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington and was a great friend to Martin Luther King Jr. King was originally scheduled to stop in Charlotte and speak at one of Hawkins' campaign events, but changed his plans and went to Memphis instead, where he was assassinated only a few days later. Politics In 1968 Hawkins announced his campaign for governor of North Carolina. His political actions had earned him many friends but also many enemies. He lost the Democratic primary to Robert W. Scott in a three-way race, earning 18.52% of the vote; Scott went on to win the election. He ran for governor again in 1972 and lost in the Democratic primary, winning 8.16% of the vote in a six-way race; the winner of the primary, Skipper Bowles, lost in the general election to Republican candidate James Holshouser. Even though he did not win, Hawkins' campaigns were symbolically important, showing that African-Americans did have the ability to run for office and try to make political changes. Throughout his life Hawkins was an ardent supporter of equal rights and integration. He continued his work, giving speeches and calling for change right up until his death in 2007.

Chromosomes occupy discrete territories in the nucleus (left). Topologically associating domains (TADs) are regions of the genome with locally high interaction frequency (center). Insulated neighborhoods are loops formed by the interaction of CTCF/cohesin- bound anchors containing genes and their regulatory elements. In mammalian biology, insulated neighborhoods are chromosomal loop structures formed by the physical interaction of two DNA loci bound by the transcription factor CTCF and co-occupied by cohesin. Insulated neighborhoods are thought to be structural and functional units of gene control because their integrity is important for normal gene regulation. Current evidence suggests that these structures form the mechanistic underpinnings of higher-order chromosome structures, including topologically associating domains (TADs). Insulated neighborhoods are functionally important in understanding gene regulation in normal cells and dysregulated gene expression in disease. Enhancer-gene targeting Mammalian gene transcription is generally controlled by enhancers. Enhancers can regulate transcription of genes at large distances by looping to physically contact their target genes. This property of enhancers makes it difficult to identify an enhancer‚Äôs target gene(s). Insulators, another type of DNA regulatory element, limit an enhancer‚Äôs ability to target distal genes when the insulator is located between an enhancer and a potential target. In mammals, insulators are bound by CTCF, but only a minority of CTCF-bound sites function as insulators. CTCF molecules can form homodimers on DNA, which can be co-bound by cohesin; this chromatin loop structure helps constrain the ability of enhancers within the loop to target genes outside the loop. Loops with CTCF and cohesin at the start and end of the loop that restrict enhancer- gene targeting are ‚Äúinsulated neighborhoods.‚Äù Function Insulated neighborhoods are defined as chromosome loops that are formed by CTCF homodimers, co-bound with cohesin, and containing at least one gene. The CTCF/cohesin-bound regions delimiting an insulated neighborhood are called ‚Äúanchors.‚Äù One study in human Embryonic stem cells identified ~13,000 insulated neighborhoods that, on average, each contained three genes and was about 90kb in size. Two lines of evidence argue that the boundaries of insulated neighborhoods are insulating: 1) the vast majority (~90-97%) of enhancer-gene interactions are contained within insulated neighborhoods and 2) genetic perturbation of CTCF/cohesin-bound insulated neighborhood anchors leads to local gene dysregulation due to novel interactions outside of the neighborhood. The majority of insulated neighborhoods appear to be maintained during development because CTCF binding and CTCF-CTCF loop structures are very similar across human cell types. While the location of many insulated neighborhood structures are maintained across different cell types, the enhancer-gene interactions occurring within them are cell-type specific, consistent with the cell type-specific activity of enhancers. Association with TADs Topologically associating domains (TADs) are megabase-size regions of relatively high DNA interaction frequencies. Mechanistic studies indicate TADs are single insulated neighborhoods or collections of insulated neighborhoods. Relevance to human disease Genetic and epigenetic variation of insulated neighborhood anchors have been linked to several human diseases. One study of a genetic variant linked to asthma disrupts CTCF binding and insulated neighborhood formation. Studies of imprinted loci showed DNA methylation controls CTCF-anchored loops regulating gene expression. Individuals with methylation aberrations at an imprinted CTCF-binding site near IGF2/H19 form aberrant Insulated Neighborhoods and develop Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome (when both alleles have the paternal type of insulated neighborhood) or Silver-Russell syndrome (when both alleles have the maternal type of insulated neighborhood). Insulated neighborhoods aid in identifying the target genes of disease-associated enhancer variants. The majority of disease-linked DNA variants identified from genome-wide association studies occur in enhancers. Identifying target genes of enhancers with disease-linked variants has been difficult because enhancers may act over long distances, but the constraint on enhancer-gene targeting by insulated neighborhoods refines the prediction of target genes. For example, a DNA variant associated with type 2 diabetes occurs within an enhancer located between the CDC123 and CAMK1D genes but only affects CAMK1D because this gene and the enhancer are within the same insulated neighborhood, while CDC123 lies outside the neighborhood. Somatic mutations that alter insulated neighborhood anchors can contribute to tumorigenesis. Chromosomal alterations such as translocations, deletions and tandem duplications intersecting with insulated neighborhood anchor sites can activate oncogenes. Epigenetic dysregulation can also contribute to tumorigenesis by altering insulated neighborhoods. IDH-mutant gliomas display altered DNA methylation patterns, so CTCF binding, which is DNA methylation-dependent, is also altered. Altered CTCF-binding disrupts insulated neighborhoods and can lead to oncogene misregulation.

It is the twelfth edition of the MLB: The Show franchise, and was released on March 28, 2017, for PlayStation 4. The American cover features Ken Griffey Jr., while Aaron Sanchez is the cover athlete for the Canadian version, and Wei-Yin Chen is on the Taiwanese cover. MLB The Show 17, like the previous games in the series, is based on the sport of baseball; more specifically, it simulates the experience of the MLB. Several game modes are included, such as \\"Road to The Show\\", in which the player creates a customizable player and plays throughout their career to the major leagues; \\"Franchise\\", in which the player controls an entire organization; and \\"Diamond Dynasty\\", in which the player creates a team of random players to compete against other players' teams. The game also has a licensed soundtrack with 12 songs. While Matt Vasgersian returns for The Show 17, commentary from Harold Reynolds and Dan Plesac replaced Eric Karros and Steve Lyons. Mike Carlucci returns as public-address commentator. MLB The Show 17 features three presentation themes: MLB Network, which features similar presentation to actual MLB Network broadcasts; Theme 1, which is used for other MLB games; and Theme 2, which is used primarily for Minor League Baseball games. MLB The Show 17 was released to positive reviews. Most critics praised the presentation and visuals, as well as the gameplay and amount of different game modes, all of which have hours of content. However, some critics still experienced online technical issues and game bugs.  New features  New features include MLB The Show 17s \\"Road to the Show\\" story mode, \\"Pave Your Path\\", in which the user controls the progression of their player's career. The mode intercuts scenes that present the player with decisions that affect the storyline. MLB The Show 17 also added features to other pre-existing game modes like \\"Franchise\\" and \\"Diamond Dynasty\\". Franchise mode places the user in control of an entire MLB team, including coaching, player development, and general- manager duties. New to this mode are features that allow the player to maintain the same level of control of their team but do it in less time than in previous iterations. Other additions include critical situations, in which the user only plays important at-bats in late innings of games, and quick manage, in which the user is in complete control of all managerial decisions during a game. As in previous versions, \\"Diamond Dynasty\\" involves building the ultimate baseball team and maintaining a virtual trading-card collection. The user creates a customized team, selecting the players (current and past), a team name, logo, and uniforms. Games are played in tournament-style competitions against other users' teams. Additional legendary baseball players have been added to collect, new missions to complete, and live updated 2017 Topps player cards. Release On December 3, 2016, MLB The Show 17 was announced with a trailer for the game that showed the game's release date along with new features. It was released worldwide on March 28, 2017, for PlayStation 4. This was the first time since MLB 06: The Show that the game was not released for the PlayStation 3. There were four different versions of the game to purchase: Standard Edition, MVP Edition, Hall of Fame Edition, and Digital Deluxe Edition. If players purchase the Hall of Fame Edition of the game, they receive the Steel Book case cover, several physical items, such as a limited edition New Era Hat, and many in-game bonuses.  Reception  MLB The Show 17 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Ray Carsillo from Electronic Gaming Monthly enjoyed the game, giving a score of 9/10. Carsillo said The Show 17 added depth onto Franchise and Road to The Show modes \\"sets a new pinnacle for the franchise\\". He also praised how the game looked, with smoother animations, new character face models, and three brand-new presentation packages. His only negatives revolve around some online issues and glitches that still continue to plague the series at launch. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer gave the game an overall score of 9 out 10 saying \\"MLB The Show 17 is an ambitious game that tries to dazzle players with new avenues of play and a story, but is at its best on the field, where the action has never looked or played better.\\" Richard Wakeling from GameSpot gave the game an 8 out of 10 and praised the gameplay stating \\"the action on the field has never been better, with smarter fielding AI, and enhanced ball physics that bring the hitting to life.\\" Wakeling criticized the commentary as \\"stilted\\" and noted the game had a few \\"blemishes lurking throughout,\\" but found those problems detracted little from the overall experience saying the product overall \\"is America's National Pastime at its best\\". GamesRadar's Ben Wilson gave the game a final score of 4 out of 5. Wilson enjoyed the game's polish and controls stating \\"Plays, looks and feels just like real baseball\\" and that the \\"Retooled ball physics and myriad new animations are the main differentiator from MLB 16, with outfielders taking more varied angles to cut off line drive doubles, and more realistic spin effects.\\" Some of Wilson's criticisms involve that any of the game's modes \\"requires significant time commitment, even with speedier options\\" and that \\"Last year's online woes remain its achilles heel\\". Caley Roark gave the game a positive review for IGN. He scored it a 9.5/10, praised the overall presentation and gameplay, and stated: \\"Overall, MLB The Show 17 builds on last year's version, which many cited as the best in the series, by adding some key features and improvements. Most notable are increased hit variety, MLB Network integration, and the RTTS documentary. All of these additions make the game feel more like real baseball. This authenticity makes games more fun to play, as it's easier than ever to become invested in every pitch.\\" Polygons Owen S. Good awarded the game an 8 out of 10, concluding: \\"MLB The Show 17 continues one of the longest-running successes in sports video gaming, and it's not a regression. But its advances sound a lot bigger on paper than they are in practice.\\" Good praised the gameplay calling it \\"wonderfully varied\\" with pitching mechanics that \\"just feels stronger\\". One negative aspect of his review involves repetition in its presentation, saying its \\"MLB The Shows biggest weakness\\". The game won the award for \\"Best Player Career Mode\\" at Game Informers 2017 Sports Game of the Year Awards, and was nominated for \\"Sports Game of the Year\\" at the 21st Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, and for \\"Game, Franchise Sports\\" at the 17th Annual National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.

Recognizable by the unusual circumstances surrounding their birth and an extraordinary precocity the enfant terrible are guilty of transgressive behavior, often destructive or suicidal, leaving the societies from which they spawned helpless to stop them. Depending on circumstances, they may eventually return to the divine world from which they come or change into benevolent powers. In the West African oral literature In oral tales and myths in West Africa, the enfant terrible can be a single character or one of a set of twins. It can appear as both a boy or girl. It is always characterized by a peculiar birth, it may be a twin (often the younger of the two) or simply a child prodigy whose gestation has been unordinary.Chevrier (2005) p. 54 In some stories, the enfant terrible has all his teeth at birth, is immediately able to talk and walk and in some stories is able to give themselves a name. In societies practicing circumcision and/or excision, the enfant terrible is also characterized as uncircumcised. In Bambara traditions, the enfant terrible carry recognizable attributes of clothing such as shells or bracelets and they are attached to the world of the bush where they are considered protected by spirits. The two other major characteristics of children are their terrible supernatural force and unusual behavior, often eccentric or evil; they are sometimes themselves the victims. They are often destructive towards the paternal family, will attack their family and friends and will break with traditions, customs and morals.Chevrier (2005) p. 55 Their behavior sometimes borders on suicidal (sawing off the branch on which they are sitting). In some stories, the history of enfant terrible are connected to the myths of the land. The child will sometimes metamorphose into lightning or rain to ascend to heaven. In others, they become ultimately beneficial, slaying a dragon that devastated the region or defeating a bird that stole the sun. Stories which include an enfant terrible, include Mwindo from the Congolese oral epic, Akoma Mba the hero of a story from the Fang clan of the Beti-Pahuin peoples and Deng a Sudanese and Malawian rain god. Analysis Jacques Chevrier emphasizes the singularity of such \\"terrible children\\" in West Africa culture, despite what the phrase \\"enfant terrible\\" can evoke among European readers. He explores the fact how initially the enfant terrible although seen as a destructive and benevolent figure can often become the savior. This paradox is explained by the fact that the enfant terrible are from the non-human or divine world and that their actions, no matter how absurd, must be interpreted as signs of superior knowledge. In the arts In Ize-Gani tale, published by the Nigerian writer Boubou Hama in 1985, Ize-Gani, the main character of the story, is a terrible child who gradually becomes a benevolent figure. L'Enfant terrible, a short animated film by Malawian director Kadiatou Konat√©, features an enfant terrible.

Most notably she received an honorary membership to the Oklahoma City Geological Society for her extensive subsurface research in the state of Oklahoma.  Early life and education  Massachusetts Institute of Technology: The school Louise Jordan attended when achieving her Masters and Doctorate. Louise Jordan was born on January 3, 1908 in the city of Joplin, Missouri to Fred A. and Anna Jordan. She attended Port Henry High School in New York, and later continued her education at Wellesley College to achieve a Bachelor of Arts degree in geology and chemistry. Jordan's interest in geology originated from her father, due to his career as a mining engineer revolving around the field of geology. Jordan furthered her passion for geology in 1931 by receiving a master's degree in Micro-Paleontology at M.I.T. Upon completion of her master's degree she taught physics at the American College for Girls in Istanbul, Turkey, before returning to M.I.T. in 1933 to begin work on her doctoral dissertation entitled \\"A Study of Miocene Foraminifera from Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and the Republics of Panama, Costa Rica and Haiti\\" which she completed in 1939. During completion of her Doctorate of Philosophy she returned to Ankara, Turkey to work as a stratigrapher and micropaleontologist for the Turkish government from 1935-1938. Afterwards she returned to Texas.  Career  While pursuing her doctorate, Jordan taught part-time at Mount Holyoke College. Jordan later pursued stratigraphy in the petroleum field. Within her Micro-paleontology degree she looked at foraminifera which was a popular field for women during that era. Post teaching, her work took her back to Istanbul to work in the field of mineral research but later coming back to the US to work for Anzac Oil & Gas Inc. in Coleman, Texas from 1938-1941. In 1941 she moved between to Dallas and Amarillo in Texas and Tallahassee, Florida to work for the Sun Oil Company (now Sunoco) until 1950. From 1950-1951, she worked as a geological consultant for the Florida Geological Survey. In 1955, she moved to Oklahoma to work at the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Jordan served as member of various professional geological societies in editorial positions and as chairman. Most notably, in 1964, she was a founding member of the Chinar Circle, a group of 35 geologist from 23 different countries. Jordan's work made her an integral part of the geological community on a local, national and international level. Her work in the petroleum field took her to the University of Oklahoma where she resided until she died in 1966 after authoring over 80 publications in reference mainly to basic geological information for the petroleum industry in Oklahoma.  History  Louise Jordan was introduced to geology at a very young age through her father, a successful mining engineer, who took his family along with him on all of his travels, which influenced Louise Jordan's love of both geology and travel. From a young age Jordan developed an interest in geology that would lead her to pursue a career in the field of geology. In 1929, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in geology and chemistry from Wellesley College. After becoming a professor she dedicated copious amounts of time to the School of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma in directing various graduate theses. She had a deep and abiding appreciation for her students and their geological problems. During her life she worked with many geology students in publishing their research and aiding future geologists to do so as well.  After death  Louise Jordan died on November 22, 1966 in Norman, Oklahoma after a long battle with a disease. The impression she left on her friends and family inspired Jordan's brother, Allen E. Jordan and friends to create the \\"Dr. Louise Jordan Memorial Fund\\". Allen donated a portion of Louise's estate into the fund designed help graduate students continue their education and research in geology at the University of Oklahoma.

There are two major groups of felids, the sabre-toothed cats of subfamily Machairodontinae and the conical-toothed cats. The conical toothed cats are divided into the pantherine cats, which include the big cats of genus Panthera and the clouded leopards of genus Neofelis, and the feline cats, which include all the rest of the cats, from the smaller Felis and Prionailurus cats to the larger puma and cheetah. Some authorities use the subfamily Felinae sensu lato for all conical-toothed cats, in which case the tribe Felini is used for the feline cats, while the pantherine cats are assigned the tribe Pantherini. Other authorities use Felinae only for the feline cats (excluding the pantherine cats), in which case Felini is a synonym for Felinae sensu stricto.

Holder of the aristocratic titles of Prince d'Avalos and Marquis of Vasto and Pescara, d'Avalos was also a descendant of the uncle of Maria d'Avalos, the murdered first wife of Carlo Gesualdo. d'Avalos acknowledged that the Italian composer Antonio Favasta convinced his parents to allow him to study music.Cummings, Robert, \\"Francesco d'Avalos\\", in All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music (Chris Woodstra, Gerald Brennan, Allen Schrott, editors). All Media Guide/Backbeat Books (San Francisco, California, USA), , p. 335 (2005). He began music studies at age 12, including piano studies with Marta De Conciliis, and later with Vincenzo Vitale. He subsequently studied composition with Renato Parodi. He considered Psiche, written at seventeen, as his first composition. He graduated with honours from the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella in Naples, with a degree in composition. He also studied philosophy at the University of Naples. He studied conducting at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena, and his conducting mentors included Paul van Kempen, Franco Ferrara and Sergiu Celibidache. From 1951 to 1954, he was a music critic for Il Quotidiano. In 1972, Nino Rota recruited d'Avalos as a composition teacher to the Conservatory in Bari, where he remained until 1979. d'Avalos then accepted a faculty post at the Naples Conservatory, where he remained until 1998. He was a guest conductor with various orchestras both in his native Italy and elsewhere in Europe. He made commercial recordings for such labels as ASV, IMP, Chandos, Brilliant, Amadeus, and Nireus. d'Avalos composed two symphonies for soprano and orchestra. His other compositions include: * Maria Venosa for soloists, chorus and orchestra. * Qumran for orchestra, for soloists, chorus and orchestra. * Hymne an die Nacht for orchestra * Studio Sinfonico for orchestra * Psiche e Eros for orchestra * Musica per un dramma immaginario (for orchestra * Vexilla Regis for chorus and orchestra * Lines for soprano and orchestra * Il Fiume Wang for soprano and strings * Sonata da chiesa for strings * Suite Slava for strings * Quintet for piano and strings * In Memoriam for piano and orchestra * Idillio for piano and string orchestra His awards and honours included: * Composition Prize \\"Marzotto Prize Selection 1958\\" * \\"Grand Prix International du Disque Acad√©mie Charles Cros ‚Äì Paris 1990\\" for recordings of symphonic works of Martucci * \\"Mra Award 1991\\" for the recording of the Third Symphony of Joachim Raff * Special Prize of the Carriera del Centro Incontro delle Arti Della Monaco (2010) * Prize of the President of the Republic \\"Oltre l'Orizzonte nel 2010\\" In 2005, Bietti published d'Avalos' book La crisi dell'Occidente e la presenza della storia ‚Äì Il significato del ventesimo secolo attraverso l'evoluzione della musica (The Crisis of the West and The Presence of History ‚Äì The Meaning of the Twentieth Century Through the Evolution of Music). In November 2013, his autobiography was published. ReferencesExternal links * Ian Bailey, Review of Chandos recording of Maria di Venosa.

He is also a former vice- presidential candidate with the Workers World Party in the 2016 presidential election. Early life and education Lamont Lilly was born in 1979 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves, being honorably discharged in 2001. In 1998 Lilly moved to Durham, North Carolina and enrolled at North Carolina Central University, studying criminal justice. He graduated in 2003. Lilly initially aspired to become a lawyer. During his sophomore year of college he worked at a store at Northgate Mall, and while there he allowed a friend to use his employee discount. He later confessed and was convicted of felony embezzlement. He subsequently struggled to maintain employment and for a time became homeless. He later credited these experiences with shaping his views of homelessness and the criminal justice system. Shortly after graduating from NCCU, he pursued graduate studies in sociology, also at NCCU, but decided to forego traditional education and worked for several years as a grassroots non-profit program coordinator, focusing on Black youth leadership and academic development. His focus on Black youth and families continued as he became an activist and community organizer. In 2005 Lilly was hired by NCCU to serve the director of its African American Male Leadership Academy. He left the job in 2008. Activism and journalism In 2011 Lilly participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City. That year he joined the Workers World Party (WWP). In 2015 he became a paid organizer for the party. He served as the party's U.S. Vice Presidential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Lilly left the party in 2018, though he still identified as a socialist. From 2013 to 2018 Lilly was a Durham political activist, a leading member of the Durham branch of the WWP, a member of WWP's National Committee, and an early member of Black Alliance for Peace. In 2010, Lilly traveled to Colombia in South America as a human rights delegate with Witness for Peace, advocating for displaced Indigenous and Afro-Colombian people. In 2015, he went to Syria and Lebanon in a group led by Ramsey Clark and Cynthia McKinney. In Beirut, he spoke as a Black Lives Matter representative at the International Forum for Justice Palestine. In Damascus, he met with members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Inside the U.S, Lilly's activism has taken him across the country. From the 2015 Baltimore Uprising after the police murder of Freddie Gray, to the Days of Grace actions in Charleston, SC in the wake of the racist massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church; Lilly has been present and involved at numerous instances of civil unrest related to racial discrimination, recording his perspective as an activist-journalist in the Black Lives Matter movement. Lilly participated in the protests in Ferguson after the 2014 police murder of Michael Brown Jr. and was present at the 2016 Standing Rock protests. Later, he led support rallies for the arrested activists who tore down the Confederate statue in Durham in 2017. Lilly has helped to lead demonstrations in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York City, Oakland, Philadelphia, and San Diego. Lilly's political and social commentary has been featured in numerous magazines, newspapers, and online periodicals including Colorlines, CounterPunch, Telesur, The Root, San Francisco Bay View, and The Charlotte Post. His activism has been featured on CNN, The New York Times, The Nation, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Fader, The Baltimore Sun, Blavity, In These Times, WUNC Public Radio, and Sojourner Truth Radio at KPFK. Lilly appears in the 2016 docuseries The Revolution Televised in Episode 3, \\"Black Lives Matter\\". He has written as a guest columnist in The Durham News, The Herald- Sun, and Triangle Tribune. As of 2020 he is a regular contributor for Truthout. He has also been a guest speaker and facilitated workshops at several colleges and universities including the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, Marshall University, and Malcolm X College. Community Lilly was awarded the 2015 Local Hero Citizen's Award by Indy Week for \\"pushing for workers' rights and police reform\\" and the 2017 Spectacular Magazine Man of the Year for \\"human rights and social justice\\". He attributes much of his political development to Monica Moorehead, Pam Africa, Mark Anthony Neal, and Mumia Abu-Jamal. He has also credited the writings of Thomas Sankara, Lucille Clifton, Amiri Baraka, Henry Dumas, Sonia Sanchez, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Kwame Nkrumah with influencing his political beliefs. Lilly currently resides in Durham's historically African-American community, Old Hayti. He is also a member of the (Alpha Kappa Chapter) of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc.

Springer-:Berlin Heidelberg Species within this group are nonsporulating, strict or facultative anaerobes that are capable of thriving in a diverse set of ecological niches. Gordonibacter species are the only members capable of motility by means of flagella within the class. Several species within the Coriobacteriia class have been implicated with human diseases that range in severity. Atopobium, Olsenella, and Cryptobacterium species have responsible for human oral infections including periodontitis, halitosis, and other endodontic infections. Eggerthella species have been associated with severe blood bacteraemia and ulcerative colitis. Taxonomy The class Coriobacteriia currently consists of 16 genera within two orders and three families. The order Coriobacteriales consists of two families, the Coriobacteriaceae and Atopobiaceae. The family Coriobacteriaceae contains the genera Collinsella, Coriobacterium, Enorma, Parvibacter, and Senegalimassilia, while the Atopobiaceae contain Atopobium and Olsenella. The Eggerthellales consist of a single family (Eggerthellaceae) and the remaining Coriobacteriia genera (Adlercreutzia , Asaccharobacter, Cryptobacterium, Denitrobacterium, Eggerthella, Enterorhabdus, Gordonibacter, Paraeggerthella, and Slackia).  Molecular signatures and phylogenetic position Historically, all Coriobacteriia species were placed within a single order (Coriobacteriales) and a single family (Coriobacteriaceae). This view, however, was not reflective of accurate evolutionary interrelationships within the class. The current taxonomic view is justified by the presence of several conserved signature indels (CSIs) that have been found at the different taxonomic ranks. These CSIs are specific and represent synapomorphic characteristics that can be used to distinguish groups within the Coriobacteriia, both at the family and order levels. The distinction of the orders within the Coriobacteriia is also supported phylogenetic tree branching and by consistent characteristics; members belonging to the Coriobacteriales are glucose-fermenting, saccharolytic species while the Eggerthellales order has species that are consistently unable to ferment glucose and are asaccharolytic. CSIs have also been used to resolve the phylogenetic position of the Coriobacteriia among all bacteria where they have been found exclusively for all species within the class, delineating them from other Actinobacteria. The Coriobacteriia are an early branching lineage within the Actinobacteria phylum The deep branching of the class has led to dispute over its membership within the phylum and whether or not it is a true actinobacterial group. A CSI in the form of a single amino acid insert in the enzyme deoxyuridine 59-triphosphate (dUTP) nucleotidohydrolase has been found that is shared by all Coriobacteriia members, as well as several Actinobacteria species, and absent from all other bacteria. This CSI provides unambiguous support for Coriobacteriia‚Äôs membership within the Actinobacteria. Phylogeny The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). *Order Coriobacteriales Stackebrandt et al. 1997 emend.

Williams (born November 26, 1937) is an American photographer, publisher, author and inventor best known for his photography documenting the civil rights movement in South Carolina beginning in the 1950s. He began his career at an early age, photographing wedding and family parties. He studied art at Claflin University, while also being a photographer for the university. His work has been published in hundreds of books, newspapers and television documentaries. His photography and art has been exhibited in galleries in the Southeast. He has recently opened a history museum named, Cecil Williams South Carolina Civil Rights Museum in his hometown of Orangeburg, S.C. featuring hundreds of his civil rights photography for national publications. Most, the museum centers on history he has captured in South Carolina.  Life and career  Cecil J. Williams born November 26, 1937 raised in Orangeburg, South Carolina. The third child of Ethel and Cecil L. Willams. His parents both have mixed ancestry; on his mother's side half white, and on his fathers side half Native American. Williams, Cecil. Personal interview. 5, May 2019. Ethel Williams, her whole life was a decided educator - elementary, high school, and college level. Cecil L. Williams was a self-employed tailor, his business was almost 80% white clientele, he did the alterations for downtown stores such as, Belk-Hudson, Barshay Marcus Clothing Store, and Limehouse Men's Stores. Williams would help his father with his business with delivering the clothes back to the stores when they were finished, and at the end of the week he would deliver the bills and collect money from the services his father would do. At the age of 9, Williams received something that what some would say changed the course of his life. His older brother had gotten a camera from his mother, but he went on to be more interested in music and the saxophone which ultimately led him to hand the camera down to Cecil. A Kodak Baby Brownie was the first camera he would ever own, which he still has, and still works. That would be the start to a new found passion, he later went onto use an extra bedroom in his house for his dark room to develop his negatives. He began photographing people on Sundays when people were dressed at their finest and develop the portraits for them. As he kept taking pictures, he began to realize that this can make money from it and began earning about a dollar or two by taking pictures of people in Edisto Gardens which is local garden all people would visit. At the age of 11, he photographed his first wedding. At the age of 12, E.C. Jones from Sumter, S.C. - William's mentor asked him to take photos of the churches of Clarendon County - which happened to hold the families of the DeLaine and the Pearson families from the Briggs vs. Elliott petition. Williams has photographed significant desegregation efforts in South Carolina since the 1950s. Some of his most notable pictures are of the activity during the Briggs v. Elliott case in Summerton, South Carolina. It was the first of five desegregation cases pushing to integrate public schools in the United States. The five cases combined into Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case that declared that \\"separate but equal\\" public schools for whites and blacks was unconstitutional. After Thurgood Marshall achieved victory for the Brown vs. Board of Education case, he came back to Clarendon Country, and to Claflin University and challenged parents to test the new supreme court ruling. As Orangeburg citizens began testing and signing up for their children to go to a desegregated schools. Then the local people began firing them from jobs, share croppers couldn't share crop any longer, and economic pressure brought upon them to depart. Orangeburg citizens began to react with a boycott. At the age of 14, he was one of 25 photographers around the world freelancing for JET magazine. JET caught wind of the movement growing in Orangeburg, they needed an onsite correspondent for constant updates, and someone to be there all the time documenting the events for them. The only time Williams made the cover of JET was during the 1969 Charleston hospital workers' strike, and his picture of Coretta Scott King speaking at the protest. As a young professional, he also contributed to other publications, including the Baltimore Afro-American, Associated Press, the Pittsburgh Courier. In January of 1960, during Williams senior year at Claflin he was visiting relatives in New York City, he had read that John F. Kennedy would be at a downtown hotel at a press conference and decided to go down to the hotel in hopes of capturing some images. He had forgot his press pass, and the hotel security was about to kick him out of the room right as Kennedy was about to come up to the podium, Kennedy told them not to kick him out, and ended up giving Williams his personal address. For the next year, while campaigning all over the United States, Williams became a close acquaintance to Kennedy and one of his favorite lensman. Williams was one of the few in the press community to be allowed on the private 10-seater jet of Kennedy's to which he named after his daughter Caroline. He graduated from Claflin University in 1960 with a bachelor's degree in art. He studied under painter and sculptor Arthur Rose Sr. at Claflin. Although better known for photography, Williams' painting, art, graphics, and architectural renderings, represent proficiency, especially among minimalists. Although at that time, because of his race, he was barred from attending Clemson University in his state to study architecture, he drew plans for several residences; one of which was featured in the June 1977 issue of Ebony; Space Age Home. He also documented Harvey Gantt‚Äôs desegregation of Clemson University in 1963, the 1969 Charleston hospital workers‚Äô strike and the 1968 Orangeburg Massacre. The massacre involved the South Carolina Highway Patrol shooting and killing three African American males and injuring 27 other South Carolina State University students. He worked as the official photographer for the South Carolina branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, South Carolina State University, Claflin University and National Conference of Black Mayors, Inc. for more than 20 years, beginning in the 1960s. His work has been exhibited at many institutions and museums, such as Claflin University, University of South Carolina, Columbia Museum of Art, Clemson University, Columbia College, Furman University, Rice Museum in Georgetown, South Carolina State University, Museum of the New South in Charlotte. Williams ran as a candidate in the South Carolina Democratic Party leading up to the United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1984. He is the second black person to do so in the state. He lost in a close race to Melvin Purvis. He ran again as a candidate in Democratic Primary preceding the United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1996. He lost to Elliott Springs Close. In 2015, Williams invented the FilmToaster, a camera scanning platform and system that digitizes film negatives faster than other methods. In 2019, in collaboration with Barry and Peggy Goldwater Foundation and Arizona Highways magazine, and Scottsdale's Museum of the West, photographs by Barry Goldwater will be on exhibit. All the photos were printed from the FilmToaster and on display from January 6, 2019-March 27, 2020. He owns a portrait studio, event, wedding photography business based in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He serves as the director of Historic Preservation at Claflin University. He is a Getty Images contributor and photographer. He also tours the nation giving presentations at conferences, events and institutions about his work during the civil rights movement. He is a member of the American Society of Media Photographers. He holds membership with Delta Chi, the Orangeburg, South Carolina Boul√© of Sigma Pi Phi, the oldest African-American Fraternity. Williams lives in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He is married to Barbara Johnson Williams, a retired educator. Willams and Barbara met while Barbara was attending college, and he was the university photographer at the time. Going through old photos, they discovered that when Barbara was in high school Williams had taken a picture of her not knowing who she was. Summer of 2019, Williams opened the Cecil Williams South Carolina Civil Rights Museum to house hundreds of images and artifacts from the civil rights movement. The Cecil Williams Civil Rights Museum looks like an ultra-modern day home which Williams designed himself in 1983-36 years before he made it into his own museum. The theme for his museum is \\"The South Carolina Events that Changed America\\". The museum will also double as the neighborhood community center.  Awards and honors  As a Claflin University student, Williams was named an honoree of both Outstanding Young Men of America and Who's Who Among Students in American Colleges & Universities. He was given the 1994 Freedom Fighter Award from the Orangeburg branch of the NAACP. Also in 1994, he received a commendation by S.C. House of Representatives, introduced by Rep. Gilda Cobb- Hunter. He received the Presidential Citation in 1995 from Dr. Henry N. Tisdale, president of Claflin University. In 2006, he was also the recipient of Claflin University's highest Award, the Bythewood Award. The South Carolina African-American Heritage Commission gave him the 2006 \\"Preserving Our Place in History\\" Award. And in 2016, the Commission presented him with the DeCosta Jr. Trailblazer Award.

Organized in 2009, the field has gained wider acceptance within the larger specialty of emergency medicine. Initiatives in social emergency medicine include research, direct service and advocacy aimed at addressing the social determinants of health.  Scope  Social Emergency Medicine encompasses many environmental and behavioral factors that affect health. These include housing and food insecurity, the use and misuse of tobacco, drugs, and alcohol, community and interpersonal violence, the impact of firearms on public health, human trafficking, and communicable disease including HIV and Hepatitis C. Proponents of Social Emergency Medicine support research to better understand the origins and impact of these factors on the health of individuals and communities, and work to create screening tools and interventions to address the issues that lead to health disparities in the population. Though there is significant overlap with the fields of social work and public health, social emergency medicine endeavors to leverage the unique position of the Emergency Department in the community to add new perspectives and information to the local and national discussions regarding our approach to addressing health disparities.  History The term ‚ÄúSocial Emergency Medicine‚Äù traces its origins to 2009, when emergency physicians at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, formed the Andrew Levitt Center for Social Emergency Medicine, an independent non-profit research and advocacy institute. In 2017 the American College of Emergency Physicians approved the creation of a Social Emergency Medicine Section, and in the same year the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine authorized the Social Emergency Medicine and Population Health Interest Group. In September 2017 a consensus conference was held in Dallas, Texas in order to further refine the definition, scope, and aims of this burgeoning field. In 2020, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) approved the creation of a Social Emergency Medicine section, as well.  Training  Despite the significant impact of social and behavioral factors on health, these topics are only recently beginning to receive significant attention in undergraduate medical education curricula in the United States. Similarly, Emergency Medicine residencies devote differing amounts of resources to teaching these topics. Most residencies provide at least introductory teaching on the social determinants of health, as advocacy around health disparities is named as a key subset of the professionalism competency in the 2016 American Board of Emergency Medicine Model of Clinical Practice. Some residencies provide an opportunity for interested trainees to dedicate more time to Social Emergency Medicine topics through tracks or concentration areas. As of 2018, these include NYU, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Johns Hopkins, and Stanford. Fellowships in Social Emergency Medicine can be found at The University of California, Los Angeles, Stanford University, and St Barnabas Hospital (Bronx). A fellowship in Population Health, which focuses on closely related content, is offered by New York University and research programs can be found at the Wisconsin Population Health Service and the Andrew Levitt Center for Social Emergency Medicine.  Screening and Interventions  Screening in the Emergency Department must be brief and/or targeted in order to be appropriate for an acute care setting. Notable examples of Social Emergency Medicine screening and interventions include: * Asking patients about safety at home and in their relationships, and helping them develop safety plans if they are experiencing abuse * Engaging with victims of gun violence to try to help break the cycle of violence in their community * Performing screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for patients struggling with substance use * Offering HIV and Hep C screening tests to all patients, or to patients with certain risk factors * Providing ED-based advocates to help connect patients with further resources in the community  References  Category:Emergency medicine Category:Public health ","title":"Social Emergency Medicine"},{"id":"52115488","text":"Nara Television Co., Ltd.

The project was initiated in the Netherlands in 2009 by Lydia Vroegindeweij and is directed towards cultural legacy and music education. Initially the project consisted of a website with educational tips and lesson suggestions to organize, among other projects, an excursion to a large pipe organ. Since 2013, Orgelkids has at its disposal a specially developed educational organ assembly kit. A complete, craftsman-built organ, in unassembled component parts, is contained in a lesson box. The instrument can be assembled and subsequently played. This so-called Do-organ is rented out by Orgelkids to organists, organ builders or organ teachers who want to organize educational projects for children.  Justification / Background  The classical pipe organ is almost always built in a fixed location in a building and not very accessible for children. Due to increased secularization of society, fewer children attend churches, so they have fewer occasions to spontaneously experience a pipe organ.an. 2016. Many smaller churches in N. America have electronic organs. In the Netherlands there is a wealth of historical organs. For the preservation and maintenance of this cultural legacy, it is important to encourage a continuing flow of new organists and organ builders. To prevent that knowledge and enthusiasm for organs continue to decline, Orgelkids has made a special instrument available to schools. An organist or organ builder visits the school with the Do-organ and supervises the students as they build/assemble the organ.  Orgelkids Do-organ  Children in primary school are assembling the Do-organ An organ in a lesson box is a unique concept, first conceived and built by Dutch organ builder Wim Janssen specially for the goal of educating children with the technology and playing of the organ. It is not a demonstration organ with just a few keys, but a real instrument with which children can self-discover how it works. That is the reason it was given the name, \\"Do-organ.\\" The Orgelkids instrument is a mechanical, tracker organ with two octaves (24 keys) and two registers which can be used independently or in combination. Air (wind in organ parlance) is supplied by a hand-pumped bellows.Verhoeven 2016. All the materials used are identical to those used in a large pipe organ (such as oak wood and sheep leather). Children experience the value and quality of craftsman-made instruments. The lesson box is supplied with instruction manuals which include many photos, by which children can assemble the organ with a minimum of instructions, in about 45 minutes. In addition, there are other lesson materials available such as an instructional video by the builder, an e-book, and a presentation for a digital blackboard. Ton Stevens, organist of the basilica of St. John in Oosterhout, the Netherlands, works with kids on World Animal Day in the basilica every year. First they build and play the Do-organ of Orgelkids, and afterwards the children can take a look at the \\"real\\" organ built by Maarschalkerweerd in 1890. Of course songs like Old MacDonald Had a Farm are played on the organ on the occasion of that special day.Rodenburg 2014  International developments  Orgelkids started in the Netherlands in 2013 with a single lesson box. The home for this organ is in the Amersfoort region, which is in the center of the country. In the first year, 1350 children were reached. In 2015 it was expanded with a second organ which is based in Belgium, operating out of Antwerp. In its first year there, 800 children were reached. The project has attracted more international attention. In Oregon a sister project, Orgelkids USA, an educational 501c3 nonprofit, was launched in 2016 with the mission to help grow a nationwide network of independent kits. They helped place five organ kits built by the US builders in their first year. Orgelkids USA kits are being commissioned to serve as regional resources by chapters of the American Guild of Organists as well as by non-profit organizations whose missions are pipe organ related.  Training for organ builders  Since 2016, Orgelkids has been supporting the training of organ builders and the passing down of artisanal skills. Organ building shops can have apprentice builders work on an Orgelkids instrument during their practical training. In doing so they develop all manner of practical skills which are also needed in the building or restoration of large, monumental organs. After completion, the organ kit can be made available for educational projects. For those who wish to build an organ kit themselves, building instructions are available including 20 technical drawings that correspond to the original organ.  Foundation  The Orgelkids project has been brought into the Dutch \\"Stichting Kerk Muziek Netwerk\\" (Church Music Network Foundation) since 2013.Van den Broucke en Vroegindeweij 2016, p. 113. This non-profit foundation engages to make relevant aspects of church music accessible to the greater public.  Orgelkids USA  US-based Orgelkids USA was founded in June 2015 as a program of the Eugene Oregon USA chapter of the American Guild of Organists, and later incorporated on 29 August 2016 as a section-501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Orgelkids USA shares a similar educational and outreach agenda as the original Netherlands-based Orgelkids organization, serving as a pilot program for the US and helping grow a nationwide network of independent organ kits. Orgelkids USA was launched with a generous grant by the New York City American Guild of Organists (AGO) ' Centennial Millennium Fund, , similar grants from the San Francisco and Seattle chapters of AGO and a social media fundraising campaign. 2017 was an inaugural year of outreach programing in the USA with two Orgelkids USA kits reaching over 700 people.

The film, directed by Robert Altman, is now considered a masterpiece. After 1958, Naughton lived in France and England. Between 1959 and 1984, Naughton published six novels in the genres of westerns and of crime fiction. The first two were published in French translation as well as English; the last two were published only in translation. Naughton was born and raised in New York City and educated in Catholic schools. He received a bachelor's degree from Boston College in 1948, and an M.F.A. degree from Fordham University in 1953. He then became a police reporter for The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky. As described in a short biographical notice, \\"he stayed for 5 years on the police beat, which he worked down to an average of an hour & a half's work per day. The rest of the time he spent playing cards and drinking beer with policemen. Once he went on an actual manhunt with them. He wrote McCabe in 1957-1958, largely out of his experience on the police beat, transposing his characters to the West.\\" In 1958 Naughton moved to Paris, France, where he worked for the International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, and as an English teacher. This book is a paperback reprint of the 1959 novel; see McCabe, which had been well-reviewed by Nelson C. Nye in The New York Times, was translated into French as La Belle Main in 1960, Translation of McCabe. and into German as Keine Chance f√ºr McCabe in 1966. He published his second novel, The Pardner, in 1971, which was also promptly translated into French (as Oh! coll√®gue). In association with the 1971 film based on it, McCabe was published in new editions and a new translation into Italian (I Compari). The novel was last reprinted as a mass market paperback in 1992. Naughton published four more novels. A Case in Madrid was published in 1973 and The Maximum Game in 1975. Two more novels appeared only in French translation: Les Cow-boys dehors! (1982 - Wild Horses) and Grand Noir et le petit Blanc (1984 - White Man, Black Man). French critic included Naughton in the Dictionnaire des litt√©ratures polici√®res (lit. Dictionary of Crime Literature). Mespl√®de writes that Naughton lost his job as a journalist in Louisville following public revelations that he was homosexual, and that this episode motivated his emigration from the United States to Europe. Film adaptation of McCabe The adaptation of Naughton's novel for the film McCabe & Mrs. Miller gave him wide recognition; the film is considered a masterpiece by prominent critics, and was entered into the U.S. National Film Registry in 2010. The story of the adaptation has been told by several film historians. The rights to McCabe were purchased in 1968 by producer David Foster through Naughton's agent in Paris, Ellen Wright. Ben Maddow was hired to write a screenplay based on the novel, and there are two versions of his work in the archives of the Margaret Herrick Library. Maddow had made substantial changes to the plot of the novel. In October 1969 Robert Altman had been signed to direct a film adaptation of the novel. Brian McKay was hired to write a second, independent screenplay. A later \\"shooting screenplay\\" is available in archives. Image of an original typescript; the location of the actual typescript isn't given. Only McKay and Altman were listed as screenwriters in the film's credits. Critic Matthew Dessem has compared the actual film with the Maddow and McKay screenplays and with Naughton's novel. Dessem concludes that the structure of the final film is reasonably faithful to Naughton's original novel. ReferencesFurther reading * Comparison of the novel with the screenplay of the film.

Abortion rights played a major role in the election, with the Democratic challengers supporting a woman's right to make a choice while the incumbents supported limits, with Shusted opposing abortion under any circumstances. Rocco and Shusted pointed to their seniority after 10 years in the Assembly as a benefit to residents of the district, with Shusted serving as chairman of the Assembly Judiciary Committee.Sullivan, Joseph F. \\"A Clear Choice Confronts the Voters In One New Jersey Assembly Contest\\", The New York Times, October 15, 1989.

He is known as one of the most significant contemporary visual artists in his country, and his work has also gained international recognition. Most of his art is concerned with the idea of representation, and his choice of art medium moves freely between photography (photorealism), printmaking, graphite drawing, installation art, audiovisual media, and sculpture. He also explores how images relate to memory, loss, and the precarious nature of human life.  Early life and education  Mu√±oz was born in 1951 in Popay√°n, Colombia and grew up in Cali, Colombia. His family was a middle class family with a strong inclination towards the arts, and his parents encouraged the artistic practices of their children. As a child, Mu√±oz was attracted to drawing, and considered it one of his favorite pastimes. He began taking classes at the Academia de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts Academy) in Cali (a school of visual arts, ballet, and theater) when he was still in high school, and the year after he finished high school he completed the visual arts study program (early 1970s).  Career = Social and political influences on art  Mu√±oz's career began in the 1970s, with his first art exhibition being held in 1971 in Ciudad Solar (Solar City) - a new alternative art space, which was considered to be one of the first of its kind to exist in Colombia, and was also a major milestone in the history of the arts in Cali. The artistic style in Mu√±oz's earliest works (which were presented in this space) was heavily influenced by what was going on internationally in the art scene, and as a result his works were concerned with photorealism and hyper-realism. In addition, the social and political issues in Colombia provided him with a subject for his art. During the early 1970s, Colombia experienced a massive urban expansion due to rural dwellers migrating to the cities. The mass movement of people resulted in the emergence of slums in order to accommodate the large influx of people. This urban phenomena taking place in Colombia drew Mu√±oz's interest, and so his first series, Inquilinatos (Tenements), focused on the social issues and changes taking place in urban life as a result of the recent urban growth. This first series of his was exhibited in the Ciudad Solar, and it was through this exhibition that he first began to gain attention for his work. In addition to the rapid urban growth taking place throughout Colombia, there was also an important creative movement taking place in the city of Cali during this time. In an interview, Mu√±oz explained it as a time of \\"extensive cultural activity and creativity, ruptures, and exploration for new possibilities in all areas.\\" He believed it was a dynamic and promising moment for Cali, and through it, he found a platform on which to present his work. Later on in the 1980s and 1990s, Colombia was plagued by wars between feuding drug cartels and the Colombian government, which acted as inspiration for several of Mu√±oz's pieces during this time. One such piece that came out of this was Ambulatorio: an aerial photograph of Cali printed on a sheet of shattered glass, which viewers can walk on, looking down on the city. As the viewers walk over the photograph, the glass continues to crack under their feet, bringing in the senses of sound and touch. Mu√±oz explained that this work was inspired by a bombing that had taken place in Cali during the violence of the 1980s and 1990s. After the bomb had exploded, Mu√±oz was able to walk through the city and in the process became fascinated by the fragments of glass he saw scattered everywhere, some of which had become encrusted into the pavement. Mu√±oz continues to explore the theme of violence in Colombia through his current works. He stated that his art endeavors to understand the mechanisms developed by a society that has suffered a routinization of war; a society whose past, present, and most likely future, will continue to be filled with violence on a daily basis. He connects this exploration of ongoing violence in Colombia to the idea of memory, attempting to understand how the continued violence in Colombia has affected the memories of society. Mu√±oz believes that in a country which has suffered through the existence of violence and wars for decades - and has become all that people have ever known in some cases - memory can become contaminated and confusing. He stated that the particularities of memory can become confused, obscured, and unresolved, and that it becomes difficult to establish distinct moments from Colombia's past and relate them to the present, because everything seems to run together in a continuing narrative of violence. Mu√±oz's work is a response to a process that has to do with his life and his environment; according to him, \\"it is my way of trying to understand this malaise.\\"  Use of different mediums in artwork  In his earliest works, he used charcoal and photography to create pieces that were focused on recreating what he saw in the social conditions around him. He saw photography as a way to add a documentary element to his drawings, and to explore elements such as light, shadow, and other details. As his career progressed, he began to focus more on the theme of reflection in his works, and so he saw photography as a way to further this idea of reflection, as well as to explore the relationships between illusion, truth, and reality - a theme which is continued in his artworks today. Even in his recent works he continues to use charcoal and photography, but he has also introduced new materials such as glass, mirrors, and audiovisual media, as well as other ephemeral materials.  Major contributions  In 2006, Mu√±oz founded a cultural center and art residency program in Cali, Colombia called Lugar a Dudas (Space for Doubts). This art center has become a place for young artists to gather in order to work through ideas, as well as to participate in a dialogue and public debate about art and politics. Mu√±oz has several works in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, including \\"Untitled\\" from the series Dried Narcissus (Narciso seco) (1996) a screenprint on acrylic, and The Game of Probabilities (2007) a series of chromogenic color prints.  Selected artworks and analysis = Inquilinatos (Tenements), charcoal drawings, 1971‚Äì1972  The Inquilinatos drawings were some of the earliest works Mu√±oz produced. These hyper-realistic charcoal drawings depicted several large mansions originally inhabited by important families on the Main Plaza of the downtown area of Cali, Colombia. During the major urban expansion in Cali in the 1970s, these mansions were abandoned by the important families, and the rooms were subsequently rented out to other rural families during a time of extreme overcrowding. Mu√±oz employed the use of photographic documentation in order to create these works. In these drawings, Mu√±oz hoped to introduce and convey the social and urban issues as well as changes that were happening as a result of the extreme urban expansion taking place in the city. Through these works he also attempted to re-contextualize and assimilate an international artistic tendency of that time period to one that fit Colombia. His drawings were first displayed in the Ciudad Solar (a groundbreaking new alternative art space in Cali), and it was through these pictures that Mu√±oz first began to receive attention for his work.  Cortinas de Ba√±o (Shower Curtains), installation art/photograph transferred to curtain using acrylics, 1985‚Äì1989  This series marked a turning point in Mu√±oz's career. Up until this point his works had consisted primarily of hyper-realistic charcoal drawings and photographs, so this marked the beginning of exploring the use of new materials in his art. Shower Curtains was an installation piece consisting of several bathroom curtains placed side- by-side. On each curtain an silhouette of a body is portrayed in different poses, making it look as if someone is standing behind the curtain and taking a shower. In order to get the images transferred onto the shower curtains, Mu√±oz used an airbrush and silkscreen to stain the curtains. This technique was meant to make it unclear to the spectator whether or not there was actually someone standing behind the curtain. The main idea Mu√±oz hoped to explore in this piece was the relationship between illusion and truth, and illusion and reality. His hope was that through this installation piece, spectators would be invited to join in and reflect on this idea as well.  Narcisos en proceso (Narcissi in process), screen print on water, first exhibited in 1995 (ongoing)  The Narcisos series is a work that has been spanning over more than 15 years. To create these pieces, Mu√±oz uses a screen printing technique, whereby he transfers a picture of himself onto a silkscreen; this screen is then placed over a tray filled with water, and charcoal is sifted through the screen. The charcoal dust settles on the surface of the water, and floats precariously \\"in an imminent process of change and destruction.\\" As the water begins to evaporate, the process of transformation begins. The image is continuously distorted as the water levels go down, and is also exposed to the circumstances of the environment in which it is in (climate, humidity, and other variables) that could alter the image's outcome. Eventually, once all of the water has evaporated, the charcoal dust settles onto paper that has been placed at the bottom of the tray and the image becomes fixed onto the paper. Mu√±oz states that there are three moments in the process of the Narcisos creation: when the dust touches the water and first becomes an image, when it goes through the process of change during evaporation, and finally when the dust settles on the bottom of the tray and becomes a fixed image. Each of these moments are meant to represent the processes of creation, life, and eventual death. In addition to this theme, Mu√±oz also explores the idea of the self-portrait - how his image becomes the image of the viewer, and how the viewer can recognize a part of themselves in the image of Mu√±oz.  Aliento, (Breath), installation art - mirrors, 1995‚Äì2002  This series consists of seven small oval mirrors screen printed with grease installed at eye level for viewers. At first the mirrors appear to be normal mirrors, but if the viewer moves closer to breathe on them, an image of another person is revealed in the vapor of the viewer's breath. The pictures that are revealed are of deceased people whose pictures were taken from newspaper obituaries, which Mu√±oz had collected over the years (many of whom had died due to political violence in Colombia at the time). The central idea that Mu√±oz wanted to explore and express in this work was that of memory - how it can never be made permanent, despite our best efforts to hold onto it - as well as the relationship between life and death. Mu√±oz explained this concept in an interview, saying that: \\"In the mechanism of breathing, there is a relationship with the other and with oneself: when you mist up the image with your breath, your image is erased, you no longer exist, and it is somebody else. But you cannot continue to exhale in order to sustain the other person, you need to inhale. So that, at the moment in which you stop exhaling and inhale again, the other person disappears and you reappear in the mirror. There is the confrontation between one's own life and that of another...\\" Through these ephemeral moments, the reflected image disappears, and reveals the fleeting image of someone who has already disappeared, who returns as a result of the breath of life given to them by the viewer. This work was further analyzed in the article, \\"Assisted Breathing: Developing Embodied Exposure in Oscar Mu√±oz's 'Aliento.'\\"  Re/trato (Self-Portrait), video of water on cement, 2004  In this work, a video is played which shows a hand using water to paint a portrait onto hot cement, however, the water continually evaporates before the portrait can be completed. This work plays on Mu√±oz's impulse to keep memory alive, and the frustration that can come along with that attempt. Because the portrait never takes on a definite form, the viewer is forced to try to remember and reconstruct the image in their mind, and so they are only able to take away an idea of it. This idea can change in the mind of the viewer, since it doesn't have a strong or permanent structure. Mu√±oz explained in an interview something he particularly liked about this work, which was that \\"the idea that something that generally functions with the ephemeral, with the temporal, with the instant, can have a lasting effect, like an intense emotional experience, that transcends the actual experience of the work.\\" This work was eventually expanded upon to become Proyecto para un Memorial (Project for a Memorial), which was presented to the public sphere in 2005.

Location The Concha d'Ostra Sustainable Development Reserve is in the municipality of Guarapari, Esp√≠rito Santo. It has an area of . The area is mainly covered by mangroves but also includes some coastal forest. Economically important fauna are crustaceans and molluscs, and fish such as sea bass and mullet. The proximity to the city of Guarapari makes it a challenge to manage the reserve and maintain its integrity. During the closed season the capture, transport and marketing of crabs is prohibited, and surveillance by SEMA is increased. History The Concha d'Ostra Sustainable Development Reserve was originally created as an ecological station in 2003. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002. It was recategorized as a sustainable development reserve by state law 8464 of March 2007. The purpose is to protect the estuarine mangroves of the Bay of Guarapari, an important breeding area for several species of fish and crustaceans, while allowing the sustainable use of these natural resources by the traditional residents. The management council was formed in October 2010. In December 2012 IEMA and the municipality of Guarapari agreed on a R$2 million project to build physical barriers, wooden walkways and gardens in an effort to stem the constant invasions and illegal housing construction that was threatening the reserve.

Geography  Eastern shore of the lake The lake is located in the Wicklow Mountains area west of Glendalough Early Medieval monastic settlement. Near the southern shore stands a small rectangular church named Temple-na- Skellig, only accessible by boat and a series of steps from the landing stage; a nearby cliff hosts a cave called St. Kevin's bed, reputedly a retreat for St. Kevin and later for St. Laurence O'Toole.  Geology  The lake is classified as a ribbon lake. The Upper and the Lower lake were at first united but one of their inflow brought an amount of sediment large enough to divide the original lake in two parts.  Hiking  Close to the eastern tip of the lake passes the Wicklow Way, a long distance waymarked walking trail, on its way from Rathfarnham in the north to its southerly point of Clonegal.  Nature conservation  Ducks on the lake shore The Upper Lake is part of the Wicklow Mountains National Park. Among the plants living near the coast can be cited the white waterlily and the broad-leaved pondweed. Some of its shore is occupied by a marsh with horsetail, bottle sedge and common reed, which is a convenient place to spot dragonflies.

Save the Dunes' mission is to preserve, protect and restore the Indiana dunes and all natural resources in Northwest Indiana‚Äôs Lake Michigan Watershed for an enhanced quality of life. History Save the Dunes council was established in June 1952 by Dorothy Richardson Buell when 21 women met at her home to create what would become the campaign to establish the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Their credo became, \\"We are prepared to spend the rest of our lives, if necessary, to save the Dunes.\\". Indiana Representative, Charles A. Halleck aggressively challenged Save the Dunes Council and their ally, Illinois Senator, Paul Douglas. Halleck carried an unwavering support for creating a port on the Lakeshore. The port would removed the large central dunes of the Indiana Dunes. The battle between Douglas and Halleck ended with a compromise with the Port of Indiana being created and the authorization of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. As a result of the more than century long advocacy effort, on February 15, 2019, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore became the Indiana Dunes National Park. It is the first national park in Indiana, and the 61st national park in the country.  Today  In partnership with Hitchcock Design Group, Save the Dunes published a homeowner's guide to landscaping in the Dunes called Living in the Dunes to help landowners protect their part of the landscape. The guide won a 2018 Honor Award from the American Society for Landscape Architects.

London. History The facility has its origins in the Highgate Infirmary which was designed by Giles and Biven for the St Pancras Union Workhouse and opened in 1869. It became known as the Central London Sick Asylum District shortly after opening. Florence Nightingale advised the architects on the design of the building and later commented that it was \\"by far the best of any workhouse infirmary we have\\" and indeed ‚Äúthe finest metropolitan hospital‚Äù. After the hospital in St Pancras Way became the St Pancras South Infirmary, the facility on Dartmouth Park Hill became the St Pancras North Infirmary in 1893. Edith Cavell worked here from 1901 to 1904. It was taken over by the London County Council in 1930 and renamed Highgate Hospital. It became the Highgate Wing of the Whittington Hospital on the establishment of the NHS in 1948. Latterly a psychiatric hospital, in 2004, the Highgate Wing was chosen by Camden and Islington Community NHS Trust as the site for Highgate Mental Health Centre and the consolidation and development of community mental health and adult social care services.

Winter and Johnson published an account of their journey in 1846 entitled Route across the Rocky Mountains with a Description of Oregon and California. The first six chapters were published in the Oregon Historical Quarterly, volume 7 (1906); the full manuscript was republished by the Princeton University Press (1932), which noted significance of a chapter which had not been published in the OHQ reprint to the historical understanding of the Whitman massacre. After returning to Indiana in 1845, he remained there until 1849, when he returned to California in the gold rush. He farmed near Mokolumne.

She received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1927 in geology from Ohio Wesleyan University. Following up her degree in geology, she attended Ohio State University granting her a PhD degree in mineralogy in 1931. Upon receiving her PhD, she joined the AC Ceramic Research Department as a mineralogist-geologist, where she worked until her retirement in 1966. She was a member of the Mineralogical Society of America, as well as a fellow of the American Ceramic Society, being one of the few female members at the time. She was also a member of the American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life  Helen Barlett attended Ohio Wesleyan University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in geology in 1927, at the age of 27. In 1931 she earned a PhD at Ohio State University.  Work  Barlett was a geologist who was interested in spark plugs, and contributed greatly to the motor vehicle world, being the first to invent insulating materials for spark plugs using alumina ceramics. When spark plug insulators were first invented, they were made of porcelain and molded on a potter's wheel, and thus, were prone to break easily. She has been credited to have discovered that high alumina metals, containing approximately 0.35 percent lithium oxide precipitated zeta alumina, and over the course of her career, gained seven patents in connection with her work. She left her position at General Motors Corporation to work on The Manhattan Project but later returned. Her essential work on spark plugs improved the overall capabilities of motor vehicles. Alumina insulator material allows plugs to handle high heat and voltage within the spark plug, enabling vehicles to operate in a more clean and, in turn, more efficient manner. By encasing the spark plugs, she had made possible for them to become quite durable. Prior to the design changes, spark plugs would get covered in byproducts spewed by the engine and had to be manually cleaned every 70 to 150 kilometers for the vehicle to function effectively.

The goals of this society are to promote, advance, and increase inclusion and exchange of ideas among the scholars in the many subfields of experimental psychology (including but not limited to behavior analysis, psychophysics, comparative, social, developmental, bio/physiological/neuropsychology/behavioral neuroscience, and the many topic areas of cognitive psychology, such as the study of memory, attention, language, intelligence, decision making, and so forth), both in basic and applied research. The society focuses on supporting research through advocacy, training and education, public policy, and outreach. It engages in a wide variety of service work, including leadership in the American Psychological Association's governance.  Membership  There are several memberships that one can have in the SEPCS, including: * Student Affiliate * Member * Professional Affiliate * Lifetime Status Member Members in the SEPCS may be APA members or fellows who affiliate with Division 3; however, one can join the SEPCS without being a member of APA.  History  When the APA was founded in 1892 by G. Stanley Hall, it was itself a small society of experimental psychologists. Given the rapid growth and breadth of the organization, a new division structure for APA was introduced in 1944, with specialty areas organized under the APA umbrella. Among the 19 charter divisions, General Psychology was Division 1, Teaching was Division 2, and Theoretical-Experimental Psychology was Division 3. Professor Edward C. Tolman of Berkeley, CA was the first Chairman (President) of the division. Charter Division 6 was Physiological and Comparative Psychology, but would merge into Division 3 (renamed the Division of Experimental Psychology) in 1949. Division 6 would re-emerge as a separate division in 1964, although most members of Division 6 (which was renamed the Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology in 2015, the same year that Division 3 adopted its current name) remain affiliated also with Division 3. The list of scholars who have served as officers of Division 3 reflects a virtual \\"who's who\\" of psychology. For example, the following psychologists (listed in chronological order) have been elected to lead Division 3 as President (or Chairman in 1945): Edward C. Tolman, Edwin Ray Guthrie, Clarence H.

Biography  His father was a master carpenter. He spent three years as an apprentice at his father's company, painting furniture, signs and crosses. Encouraged by the lithographer and art dealer, , he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna. His teachers there included Leopold Kupelwieser and Thomas Ender. After 1830, he largely earned his living as a porcelain painter. Probably as the result of a recommendation by Kupelweiser, he was awarded a scholarship by the Upper Austrian Landstand that enabled him to continue his studies from 1834 to 1837. During this time he also exhibited and won the Lampi-Preis for model drawing in 1836. He was married in 1839. Originally, he did genre and historical scenes, but he decided to switch to portraits and soon became so popular that he was able to purchase a large house in Vienna with a four-horse carriage and a Moor as a servant. During the Revolution of 1848 he sided with the revolutionaries. Possibly due to the trouble this caused, his wife left him in 1850. From then until 1870, he was a regular participant at the exhibitions of numerous Austrian art societies. It is unclear if he was divorced or his first wife died, but he was remarried in 1866. His new wife's extravagance eventually forced him to take more orders than he could handle, as well as turn to making copies of the Old Masters. She died in 1889, and he died the following year. He was interred at the Zentralfriedhof. In 2013, a major retrospective was jointly hosted by the and the .

The Irish pension system is designed as a pay-as-you-go program and is based on both public and private pension programs. The Pensions Authority regulates occupational pension schemes, trust RACs, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs), employers and Registered Administrators (RAs). It is a statutory body set up under the Pensions Act, 1990. Description The OECD's Reviews of Pension Systems: Ireland, explains the structures of both the public and private pension systems. \\"The public pension system has two sets of flat-rate benefits: 1) a basic flat-rate benefit to all retirees that meet the contribution conditions, the State pension (contributory) or SPC and the State pension (transition) or SPT; and 2) a means-tested benefit to those that have not contributed or have not contributed enough, the State pension (non-contributory) or SPNC. The SPC is payable from age 66, with the maximum personal rate of EUR 230.30 a week for a single person (paid for 52 weeks per year), corresponding to 33.1 percent of average earnings. The SPNC is currently payable from age 66, with a maximum rate of EUR 219 per week for a single person, i.e. 31.5 percent of average earnings. All recipients of pension benefits are entitled to the Household Benefits Package comprising an electricity/gas and telephone allowance as well as a free television license, if they are over the age of 70, while those between the age of 65‚Äì69 are means-tested. The contribution conditions for the SPC are that recipients have started paying social insurance before reaching age 56 and they also have paid at least 520 full- rate insurance contributions if reaching 66 after April 6, 2012. The contribution base rate is currently 14.75 percent, with 10.75 percent paid by employers and 4 percent by employees (except for employees who earn less than EUR 352 per week for whom only employer contributions are payable). The SPNC is financed through general taxation and is paid according to need. As for private pension programs, there three main types; 1) occupational pension schemes that are set up by employers; 2) Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSAs) that are personal pension saving plans and contributions are made by individuals; and 3) Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) that are also a personal pension saving plan but are excluded from those who are already enrolled in a company pension plan\\". When looking at the coverage of public and private pension programs, SPC and SPNC cover 46 percent of the workforce, and SPT and occupational or private pension covers 37 percent of the workforce, which is a result from striking differences in industries and occupations. Raab and Gannon point out how \\"occupational pensions are generally not mandatory, except in the public sector, and that 55 percent of professionals are able to expect a firm's pension but the corresponding share for sales people is 23 percent\\". The Irish pension policies are designed to offer incentives for labor participation but are still reforming to the changes in the economy.  State Pension System  The Irish state pension is designed to give a basic retirement income. There are two forms of State Pensions in Ireland: The Contributory State Pension and The Non-Contributory State pension.  Contributory State Pension  The Contributory State Pension is a social insurance program that constructs pensions from a contribution-based payment system (a pay as you go system). Because workers contribute to the pension themselves it is not a means tested system. It is allotted to those over the age of 66 who have fulfilled the following qualifications: * Began paying social contributions by the age of 56 (this age is raised for those born before 1922). * Have paid at least 520 full rate contributions before reaching the qualifying pension age. * Met the average number of contributions per year. This average can be achieved in two different ways. Method one, called the normal average, is achieved by meeting a yearly average of ten adequate contributions from 1953 or the year one enters insurance, whichever is later, to the qualifying pension age. Method two, called the alternative average, is achieved by having an average of 48 contributions from 1980 to the pension qualifying age. These contributions can be Class A, E, F, G, H, N, or S social contributions. The Contributory State Pension can be paired with other income and is taxable, but it is unlikely to be taxed if it's a pensioners sole income. The pension can max out at a yearly value of ‚Ç¨12,651.60. A pensions maximum value is not determined by the pensioners earnings level, but their social insurance contribution history. Having an average of 10 adequate contributions a year will garner the minimum pension, while an average of 48 and above will garner you the maximum pension.  Non-Contributory State Pension  The Non-Contributory State Pension is for those over the age of 66 who are unable to qualify for a Contributory State Pension. To qualify for the Non-Contributory State Pension one must be a habitual resident of Ireland and pass means test. The means test evaluates a citizens cash income, capital (excluding their home), and income derived from personally used property.  Recent Changes to the State Pension System  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act of 2011 made changes to the qualifications needed for both the Contributory and Non-Contributory State Pensions. The act rose the qualifying age from 66 in a stepwise manner. Those born after 1 January 1955, but before 1 January 1961 are now are eligible to collect their state pension at 67. All those born after 1 January 1961 will be eligible to collect their pensions at 68. Raising the pension eligibility age of pensions is a contentious issue, but a slim majority of 53% acknowledge the fiscal need to raise the eligibility age. More changes to the qualifications for the Contributory State Pension are expected to be rolled out in 2020. These changes are being implemented to shift more future pensioners over to Contributory State Pensions in an attempt to reduce the fiscal impact of the pension system. Currently 19% of pensioners are on Non-Contributory State Pensions and spending on these pensions makes up 16 % of the budget. These changes will not affect those currently on Non Contributory Pensions.

The typical family unit in Ireland is the nuclear family with children at 49 percent, with families without children, 21 percent, and single mothers, 15 percent, being the next two common family types. In Babies and Bosses, it states that \\"the main Irish support for families is the universal non-taxable Child Benefit (paid for children under the age 16 or 16‚Äì19 and in full time education), which trebled in value between 1997 and 2002. The Irish in-work benefit, the Family Income Supplement (FIS) is paid to low-income families with dependent children, where parents work at least 19 hours per week between them, to provide financial incentives for low-skill jobless families to enter work and because of the lower hours limit ensures that it is paid to those who are more than marginally attached to the labor market\\". As Millar, Coen, Bradley and Rau state in their article on parenting, work, and family policies, \\"the growing number of Irish women engaged in paid work contributed significantly to economic growth and the so-called \\"Celtic Tiger\\" boom, from only 7.5 percent in 1971 to 48.8 percent in 2004\\". They also state that because of the increase of female labor participation, most Irish women suffer from \\"dual burden\\", which is because family policies have lagged, leaving no support for child care services. Even though family policies are a bigger concern in Ireland compared to other liberal democracies, the Irish female labor participation is much lower. There is still plenty of improvements that need to be made in Irish family policies.

The claim remains unproven.  Background  Williams was born in 1985 to Danney Williams Sr. and Bobbie Ann Williams, a former prostitute. The story came to notice in the late 1990s when reporting by Newsmax led by celebrity tabloid magazine Star to commission a paternity test prove whether Williams is actually Clinton's biological son. Time magazine cited Star on July 18, 1999 to say that there was no match. The story was revived in 2016 before the 2016 presidential election and pushed by a number of media outlets including Newsmax, the Drudge Report, as well as WorldNetDaily, and the New York Daily News. Due to some uncertainties with the original test by Star, Snopes concluded that the claim was unproven. The Washington Post stated that, while the test could not prove Clinton was the father, it did conclusively rule him out as the father. On October 19, 2016, Williams' lawyers announced their intentions to file a paternity suit to prove that Clinton's DNA matched Williams'. Williams wrote to Monica Lewinsky asking for her dress in order to obtain a sample of Clinton's DNA. However, Lewinsky never replied to Williams. A partial analysis of Clinton's blood, and thus his DNA, was already part of the public record because of the Lewinsky affair investigation. Russian-funded Facebook advertisements prior to the 2016 presidential election included ads claiming that Williams was Clinton's son.Schultz, Marisa (1 November 2017).

The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 12, 2018. It was released on April 6, 2018, by Netflix. Plot Katie prepares a surprise birthday party for her boyfriend Jack on the 4th of July. While setting up the decorations, she exhibits Type-A quirks and consistently attempts to keep things on schedule. As her parents, Gayle and Gary, and her friends continue to set up, Katie leaves to pick up the cake and makes a stop to pick up her brother Seth and his young daughter Ella. Throughout the film, Katie has hallucinations of she and Seth drowning as the car inexplicably fills with water; meanwhile, an audio book narrator reads from a story where a woman fails to properly sail a boat and drowns as a result. Katie sees piles of unopened mail inside Seth's apartment, leading her to suspect that Seth has relapsed in his heroin addiction. She drives around town trying to find a detox center after Seth's previous one denies his health insurance. After sending Seth to a downtown detox center in a taxi and returning to the party with a sleeping Ella, Katie receives a call that Seth is unable to be admitted. Katie finds Seth in a sickly state and continues to search for a center throughout the Los Angeles area, missing Jack's arrival to the surprise party. Seth pleads with Katie to buy heroin for him for pain relief. In a homeless area near Skid Row, Katie buys heroin for Seth, which is packaged inside six small balloons. Katie returns to the car and Seth asks her to go back and buy a needle from a man living under a tarp. Katie refuses so they all head to a nearby drug store. At the drug store, the pharmacist realizes that Seth is a heroin user and gives Katie the key to the bathroom where she changes Ella‚Äôs diaper. Seth prepares his injection in a vacant stall as Katie pleads with him to not use very much. Seth becomes revitalized and the three depart. Before leaving, Seth hands Katie the key to the bathroom and laughs about her having to take it back to the now closed pharmacy. Katie gets into an argument with the pharmacist and throws the bathroom key at the pharmacy door. This sets off the alarm which causes Katie to run back to the vehicle and drive off. On their way back to the party, Katie reminisces with Seth about their childhood and they stop by the bakery to retrieve the cake. In the car, Seth promises that his latest injection is his final use of heroin. Back at the party, Katie's parents and Jack realize Seth is under the influence given his obnoxious and giddy behavior. They confront Katie over the night's events and she assumes guilt. Seth leaves Ella in the backyard while he leaves to use heroin; Ella begins to look for him throughout the house. Katie finds Seth injecting again in her car. She tells him that she will no longer take care of him, insisting that the only way for him to kick his addiction for good is to check-in to rehabilitation without her help. Katie, no longer burdened by Seth or the hallucinations, steps out of the car onto the street and admires the night sky filled with fireworks.

The Visiting Nurse Associations of America (VNAA) is the professional association for VNAs.  History  Visiting nurses of Detroit (1914) In the late 1800s several district nurse associations began to form in the northeastern United States based on the British district nurse model. Among the first district nurse associations in the United States were the Buffalo District Nursing Association in 1885, The Boston Instructive District Visiting Nurse Association in 1886, Visiting Nurses Association of Philadelphia in 1886, and the Chicago Visiting Nurse Association in 1889. The current VNA model finds its origins in the Visiting Nurse Service of New York founded by nursing pioneer Lillian D. Wald in 1893 to teach home classes on nursing and healthcare to poor immigrants in New York's Lower East Side. Today there are over 12,000 home health care agencies listed on the Medicare database. In 2004 the United States Congress recommended the establishment of a Visiting Nurse Association Week reporting that there are over 500 individual VNAs in the United States employing over 90,000 clinicians which provides healthcare to 4,000,000 people annually. In the same report they claimed that VNAs are one of the largest providers of immunizations in the Medicare program with more than 2,500,000 influenza immunizations given manually. The first Visiting Nurse Association Week was celebrated in 2005 in order to increase awareness of the charity-based mission of VNAs and is held annually on the second week in May.

It was founded by Aida Flemming in Fredericton, New Brunswick, in 1959. Origin and growth In 1957 Aida Flemming, the wife of New Brunswick premier Hugh John Flemming, sponsored a children's essay contest in Carleton County, New Brunswick on the topic: \\"What is being done now for the protection of animals and what more could be done?\\" Encouraged by the response, she launched the Kindness Club in 1959 with an article in the magazine Atlantic Advocate proposing a club for children between the ages of 5 and 13. The organization was based on the principle of reverence for life, the ethical concept developed by Albert Schweitzer, and when the club grew into an international organization Schweitzer accepted Flemming's invitation to act as its honorary president. By 1962 branches had been established in the United States, New Zealand and England. Members pledged \\"to be kind to animals (as well as people) and to speak and act in defense of all helpless creatures\\". An early member of the Kindness Club was the environmental activist Paul Watson, who has credited the club with teaching him to \\"respect and defend animals\\". The Humane Society of the United States took on the responsibility for clubs in the United States while the World Federation for the Protection of Animals in Switzerland oversaw the other international chapters. By 1984, the club's 25th anniversary year, it had chapters in 22 countries. In the 21st century In 2009, the Kindness Club's 50th anniversary year, most of its members were in Canada. Continuing to base itself on Schweitzer's reverence for life philosophy, the club promotes humane education for children and contributes to local initiatives including subsidized spay/neuter programs and donations of pet food to food banks. The Kindness Club in Canada is administered by the Kindness Club Foundation Inc., which was incorporated in New Brunswick in 1963.

She sold many fossils to other collectors and investigators to earn money on the side. Her most significant discovery was the Persephone butterfly near Florissant, Colorado. Charlotte's discoveries brought attention to Florissant as an important location for fossils, and her findings created an impetus for recognition of the fossil beds as a national monument within the United States of America. Many of her collected fossils now reside in the Harvard University museum and the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History. The fossil rose Rosa hilliae was named after Charlotte Hill in 1883.  Early life  Hill was born on February 15, 1849 in Indiana. She migrated west from Indiana, pioneering into the then new settlement of Colorado City in 1874. Charlotte married her husband Adam Hill at the age of thirteen, where they then both built their home in Florissant in 1874 and filed a homestead claim in 1880. The Homestead Act of 1862 is how most of the private land in the midwestern United States became the private land of homesteaders to encourage farming. This included private ownership by single women and freed slaves. Together the couple raised seven children, two of whom died at young ages. Children's names were Hiram (age 12), Walter (age 10), Margaret (age 5) and Mable (age 1). According to the 1880 census, Charlotte's occupation listed on the same census was ‚ÄúKeeps House‚Äù, while her husband Adam's occupation was listed as ‚Äúcollects specimens‚Äù. Another child Minnie Bell died December 1877 at 11 years old. Two other children had died previously. Furthermore, Charlotte's brother, John D. Coplen, helped to form the Colorado Museum Association in 1883 to transport petrified stumps to city museums along with fossils to be displayed and later opened ‚ÄúCoplen‚Äôs Petrified Forest‚Äù. A resort for tourists to stay and collect fossils, hosting approximately 3,000 visitors in 1924. Charlotte Hill's museum in Colorado City was one of 14 businesses listed in the 1984 Colorado City business directory, displaying specimens from the Florissant fossil beds. Colorado City is where Hill's interest of fossils first began as the city is just beside the Florissant Fossil Beds.  Work  The mid 1870s led to a historic boom surrounding the florissant fossil beds, which ultimately led to two highly notable scientific finds. In the summer of 1877, 18 princeton students and two professors made their way down to the fossil beds. The trip was led by three of the involved students; Henry Fairfield Osborn, William Berryman Scott, and Francis Speir. When the princeton students arrived in Colorado they met with Charlotte Hill who showed them an impressive fossil collection, containing hundreds of perfectly preserved species of insects and leaves. The Princeton students took many of these fossils back home for study, and also excavated several leaf and fish fossils of their own, during their time in Florissant. Many of these shared discoveries went on to become important type specimens for the descriptions of new species. In the same summer, Hill met scientists, Samuel H. Scudder and Arthur Lakes, who were amazed by her large collection of fossils. With Hill's help Scudder and Lakes were able to conduct a large scale dig close to the Hill's homestead. The excavation consisted of the digging of a huge trench, in which researchers were able to find fossils within delicate shale beds, by cracking the shale in half. However, many fossils were lost during this process, as shale becomes very delicate when exposed to the elements and would often crumble with fossils still hidden inside of it. In turn, Leo Lesquereux's 1883 monograph described and named many new specimens obtained by Scudder, and the Princeton Scientific Expedition of 1877 which purchased fossils from Hill. In 1890, Scudder, published a monograph detailing several prominent finds from Florissant entitled The Tertiary Insects of North America. The monograph was a jaw dropping size of seven hundred and thirty four pages, and weighed an astonishing seven pounds. The study of butterflies were of particular interest to Scudder, and his work helped to make Hill's perfectly preserved Prodryas Persephone famous. In the 1880 census Adam and Charlotte listed their profession as specimen collectors and began selling their finds to educational institutions and tourists. Charlotte kept a small museum in their family home, built by Adam Hill in 1874. Specimen collection and sale became a profession for many as homesteaders, academics, and tourists scavenged the fossil rich land, situated just south of Hill's home, beside the large petrified base of a Sequoia stump, known as \\"The Big Stump\\". The Florissant Fossil Beds were heavily exploited during this time and this meant that thousands of potentially useful fossils disappeared into the hands of private owners, never to be seen again by the scientific world. With the introduction of the railway, thousands of tourists flooded the area and these scientific loses only grew. It wouldn't be until 1915, when Dinosaur National Monument was established by the U.S government, that similar conservation concerns would be expressed towards Florissant. The area would not be named a protected national monument until 1969.  Personal life  Hill passed away in California in 1930. Legacy A monument was unveiled on Charlottes 160th birthday in 2009, recognizing her accomplishments and impact on the collection of fossils and the establishment of the Florissant Fossil Beds.

Historical hints  The palace of Pia Opera Pastore today The building was constructed between 1870 and 1874, following the testamentary dispositions of the baron Felice Pastore Cambon, and assigned to the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. His wife, that is Donna Stefania Naselli di Montaperto of the dukes of Gela and sister of Giovan Battista Naselli, the archbishop of Palermo (1853-1870), was decisive in fetching the Nuns of Charity to Alcamo. In fact, even if she could stop the foundation of this institution, as she survived her husband, she did not do it, on the contrary she helped it. Its main purposes were the following: *Housing girls to educate and instruct them, in order to be useful to themselves and to society. *Daily hosting external girls in apposite rooms, in order to receive the religious education and instruction appropriate for their class, preferring the poorer ones.Roberto Calia: L'istituto Pia Opera Pastore e lo Spirito di S.Vincenzo de Paoli in Alcamo; Campo, Alcamo, 1985 *Daily curing of the sick people, external to the institution, in some separate rooms, and doing home-based health care: these activities had to be done by the Daughters of Charity. The foundation had also to keep a dispensary and a pharmacy for the people in need that the Nuns had to care. Initially, from 1870 to 1874, it operated at Palazzo Pastore in corso 6 Aprile, then it moved to the seat in via Pia Opera Pastore. The first Mother superior was Suor Luisa Castets, a French woman from Besan√ßon and in the first years of its actitivity classes were given in French. In 1913, owing to financial problems, they modified the statute and closed the pharmacy; between 1914 and 1916 it was the seat of a private Teachers' training school (Istituto Magistrale). Thanks to a financing by the Ministry of the Interior, there was an antitubercular preventive sanatorium for children who were lodged at the prophylactic Dispensary, if they were sick, and went back home when they had recovered their health.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.149, 231, Alcamo, Campo, 2001. In 1945 they set up an infirmary, a new hall for sick people; in 1954 they opened a nursery school, which was closed in 1958. Owing to the 1968 Belice earthquake, the premises were unfit for use, but the nuns went on assisting the earthquake victims from Alcamo and the neighbouring towns. The building is internally divided into three wings, with the chapel in the central one on the ground floor, which you can enter through a lobby; there were the waiting room, the secretary's office, service rooms and a large corridor here. The right wing was occupied by the nursery school and the left one by the elementary school, that was free for poor families and fee-paying for the rich ones. In the rooms adjoining the chapel there were the kitchen and the refectory; on the first floor there were once the dormitory and the laboratory of cutting and embroidery. In 1956 they built a new wing for the Preventorium, closed in the sixties thanks to the improvement of the hygienic and sanitarian conditions in Alcamo. Later, in 2000 the nuns were moved. At present the premises belong to IPAB (Public Institutions of Assistance and Charity: Opere Pie Pastore and San Pietro): some of them are rent for vocational training courses, others are used as a hospitality centre for non- EU immigrants.http://trapani.gds.it/2015/12/26/alcamo-torna-a-rivivere-la-pia- opera-pastore_454073/  Association Figlie di Maria, Ladies of Charity and Female Crusaders of Purity  In 1870 the Vincentian nuns, or Daughters of Charity were called to start the activity of Pia Opera Pastore; one year later they founded the Association Figlie di Maria (the Virgin Mary's Daughters), soon approved by the superior General, which adopted the Statute that was in force in Italy and continued its activity until 2000. On 29 July 1900 the Association \\"Dame di Carit√†\\" (that is Ladies of Charity) was founded by Sister Margherita Castets, Mother Superior of Opera Pia: it was formed by women who wanted to devote themselves to the comfort of sick people, the outcasts and the poor. The main purpose was promoting spiritual and charitable activities, obtaining food, clothes and money. The members had to be devotee of Saint Vincent de Paul and the Blessed Luisa di Marillac, imitating the virtue, above all charity, praying, receiving Holy Communion and saying the Rosary in suffrage of the dead sisters. The association helped the soldiers' families during World War I, and after Caporetto, it gave support and food to the refugees who were in Alcamo; other important activities were: for the endemic diseases in the period 1929-39, for the soldiers camped in Alcamo during World War II (1935-1951) and various activities financed by the regional government of Sicily between 1944 and 1960. In 1924 they founded the Association Little Ladies of Charity, whose protector was Saint Luisa di Marillac: its members were girls aged 16, 17 and 18, wearing a blue skirt, a white blouse and black shoes. Their purposes were: *Visiting periodically poor people and prisoners *taking care of the sick *getting clothes for the people in need. During the period of the crisis in the 1920s, these Little Ladies cooperated with the Nuns, collecting wheat and flour, and getting funds for poor families through different activities like theatre, concerts, etc. During World War II they visited the soldiers who were hospitalized, helping them; in this terrible period the Pia Opera was a real charitable asylum: every day they served a hot meal for more than 1,000 people, and a school meal for more than 100 children. Besides, every year on 15 March (the feast of Saint Luisa di Marillac), on 19 July (Saint Vincent de Paul), and on 20 November (Saint Elizabeth of Hungary) they offered a lunch for the poor in the garden. In 1935 the bishop of Mazara del Vallo (considering what they had agreed in the national congress held in Rome in 1932, the statute of the Ladies of Charity and after a meeting with all the parsons of the town) established that all the parishes had to found the parish associations of the Ladies of Charity. This decision, taken with the unanimous agreement of the parsons, and with a specific statute, helped the decentralization of the charitable activities connected with Pia Opera Pastore. Since 2 October 1976 the Association was absorbed by the \\"Juvenile Group of Vincentian Volunteering \\". Finally, on 30 May 1935 Sister Elvira La Paglia founded the association of the \\"Female Crusaders of Purity\\": upon admission they swore \\" to detest indecent fashion\\". The purpose of this association was to \\"divulge good and sound customs against the spreading of unseemliness and wordliness of fashion\\". The association is not existing any longer. \\".  Description and works in the Chapel  The architectonic structure is in neoclassic style, with triangular-shaped windows. Above the front door there is the Pastore family's coat of arms, represented by a shepherd's crook, three stars and a tower; there is also a balcony of honour with a parapet and small columns.http://www.turismo.trapani.it/it/5943/istituto-pia-opera-pastore.html The beautiful chapel, adjoining the foundation, is dedicated to saint Francis of Sales; it is with one nave, three altars in grey and white marble. You can admire some fine architectonic parts in the 18th century Roman style. The building was realized after the design of Giovan Battista Palazzotto and Agostino Castiglia, two architects from Palermo.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico- artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982. A vintage photo of the fa√ßade The chapel was restored in 1983 and has twelve columns, Corinthian capitals, a dome with a large skylight; there are these works: * The white marble high altar realized by Vincenzo Venezia in 1877, with a great circular tabernacle having six columns with gilded corinthian capitals; above the altar there is a large painting of the Immaculata made in 1866 by Natale Carta from Messina. The Virgin Mary is depicted while looking at heaven and her joined hands: she is wearing a dark red dress and a dark blue mantle. *A mosaic made by Gaetano Costa from Alcamo on the central panel of the altar: it represents three circles (symbolizing the Holy Trinity) with the Lamb of God holding the Book of Life. *Ambon: designed by the architect Settipani, it symbolizes Jesus Christ's empty sepulchre, from which they announce the Gospel. *Left altar: Saint Francis of Sales, a painting made in 1890 by Giuseppe Di Giovanni from Palermo; the saint is in ectasy among a host of angels. *Right altar: Saint Vincent de Paul, a painting made in 1890 by Giuseppe Di Giovanni; Saint Vincent de Paul is represented while talking with three Sisters of Charity and six little orphans are listening to him. *On the right side of the choir: the gravestone in memory of the two barons Pastore; wife and husband, buried here. *Two marble busts of the baron Felice Pastore and Stefania Naselli, in the lobby. *Some candelabrums In the sacristy and in the parlour there are these paintings: * the Blessed Giovan Gabriele Perboyre (1926), made by the priest Francesco Alesi; it represents a young Vincentian missionary with the cassock and folded arms, holding a small palm with his left hand and embracing a cross with the right one *the Blessed Francesco Regis Clet (1924), painted by the priest Francesco Alesi; it represents a young missionary leaning on a sparkling cross, with his right hand on the chest and holding a palm with the left one. *Santa Luisa di Marillac: painted by Francesco Alesi too; the saint is kneeling with the crown and a cross on her hand, contemplating a statue of Our Lady. Behind her there are two nuns assisting poor people. *Saint Francis of Sales: by an unknown author; the Saint is sitting on an armchair and wearing a violet tunic, a penitent is wearing 18th century clothes. The Saint is pointing to a dove symbolizing the Holy Ghost to him. Today the chapel is used for religious services and meetings of religious kind.

History  The paper began as a community builder and was first published by Wessel & Dobbins. Later, as the publication grew it took on a clear political stance and tone, the paper was published by the Courier Publication Company. The articles published after 1892, push a Republican platform. In 1895, Sarah B. Harris and the Nebraska author, Willa Cather were added to the editorial staff of the Courier. Although Cather would leave the paper as an editor in 1898, she would continue to send pieces for publishing during her life. In 1896, Harris was promoted to managing editor of the newspaper. This allowed for a feminine voice to prominently take part in Nebraska's newspaper revolution. With the change in editors, the Capital City Courier became a social platform and identified itself as an \\"official organ of the Nebraska State Federation of Women's Clubs\\".

Last modified December 1, 2011. http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poet/item/21106/19/Barbara- Kohler.  Early life  Barbara K√∂hler was born in Burgst√§dt, East Germany, April 11, 1959. She grew up in Penig. After finishing the Abitur, the school system in Germany, she was a textile production worker in Plauen for a while. Before becoming a poet, she also worked in an elderly home, and was a lighting assistant for the city theater in Karl Marx Stadt, now known as Chemitz. In 1985, she studied at the Johannes R. Becher Literature Institute in Leipzig for three years, then started publishing work for magazines. Once the Berlin Wall fell, her own poetry and work began being published.  Career  Barbara K√∂hler's career in poetry took off in 1991 with the publication of her first collection, Deutsches Roulette, meaning German Roulette. She published several other works succeeding Deutsches Roulette. In 1995, she published Blue Box while working as a town writer in Rheinsberg. In 1997, she wrote as a residence writer at the University of Warwick. A year later, Cor Responde was published and, a year after that, Wittgensteins Nichte was as well. In the early 2000s, Barbara K√∂hler worked on her German translations for Stein and Beckett's writing. In 2000, Ungarisches Wasser, meaning Hungarian Water, also came out. In 2007, her latest work, Niemands Frau and No One's Boxwas published. Currently, Barbara K√∂hler is a freelancer and has been since 1988. Today, she lives in Duisburg, after moving there in 1994.  Writing = Use of language  Barbara K√∂hler's writing style is characterized by her use of language. She plays with the grammar and diction in her poetry, and demonstrates the subjectivity of language. She often has a stanza, then repeats it, except one similar sounding or spelled word from that stanza will have been changed, altering the stanza's original meaning. This is shown in work such as Niemands Frau, the premise of the retelling being that \\"er\\", meaning \\"he\\" in German, is changed to \\"sie\\", meaning \\"they\\" or \\"she\\" in German, switching from the single voice of Odysseus to the various female voices and showing their point of views.Bitter, Mirjam. \\"Transpositionen von Text, Textil und Textur. Barbara K√∂hlers und Rosi Braidottis Entw√ºrfe beweglicher, aber nicht haltloser Subjektivit√§ten.\\" German Monitor 78 (2013): 117-138.  Influences  Barbara K√∂hler was heavily influenced by classic literature. This was possibly attributed to the time period she wrote in, which was known as the \\"classical turn\\" in German poetry during the mid-1990s. With East Germany's collapse in 1989 and German reunification in 1990, writers looked back on classic literature and philosophers to explain civilization and to understand the changes that were occurring around them. They used ancient works as models, looking for relationships between their present reality to ancient myths, especially through the work of Homer. Thereby potentially influencing Barbara K√∂hler, as Niemands Frau focuses on the Odyssey. However, Barbara K√∂hler's interest in Homer may be accredited to her own understanding as a poet and skepticism of the classics. She criticizes classical material for its ideas and assumptions about women's passivity and how classical material has passed down these ideas into western culture. K√∂hler, therefore, seeks and writes about portrayals of women who are independent and free from these assumptions. Work with the classics and literary heritage was, for K√∂hler, done to \\"interrogate the grammar of patriarchal power.\\"Paul, Georgina. \\"Introduction\\". German Monitor 78 (2013): 1-17.

It has rough, ribbony bark at the base of its trunk, smooth greyish bark above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine with ridges along the sides, white to cream-coloured flowers and cylindrical fruit.bark on a specimen near the Yumbarra Conservation Park Description Eucalyptus ceratocorys is a mallee, rarely a straggly tree, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough flaky bark near the base of the trunks and shaggy, ribbony bark above that does not shed cleanly. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and greyish green, egg- shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of seven or nine on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped with ridges along the sides, long and wide with a beaked operculum long. Flowering occurs between July and December and the flowers are white to cream coloured, rarely red. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical capsule long and wide with ridges along the sides. The fruit have a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming The horn- capped mallee was first formally described in 1934 by William Blakely who gave it the name Eucalyptus angulosa var. ceratocorys from a specimen collected near Comet Vale. Blakely published the description in his book A key to the Eucalypts. In 1988, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill raised the variety to species status as Eucalyptus ceratocorys. The specific epithet (ceratocorys) is derived from the Ancient Greek words keras meaning \\"horn\\" and korys meaning \\"helmet\\", referring to the beaked operculum of this species. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus ceratocorys grows in sandy soil in shrubland between Koorda and the southern fringe of the Great Victoria Desert in the southern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.

Vandervall (March 23, 1832 - 1898) was an early African-American Baptist preacher in Nashville, Tennessee. He began preaching while still a slave. After emancipation, he helped found Roger Williams University. Early life and career Randal Bartholomew Vandervall was born a slave on March 23, 1832.Lovett, Bobby L. Randal B. Vandavall (1832-1898), published for the Annual Local Conference on Afro-American Culture and History, 1995, accessed October 27, 2016 at http://ww2.tnstate.edu/library/digital/vand.htm He was born near Neely's Bend in Tennessee about ten miles above Nashville on the Cumberland River. His parents were named Sylvonia and Lewis. Sylvonia was owned by a man named Major Hall, and Lewis by a man named Foster. Lewis was a coachman and was only allowed to visit his wife and eleven children once per year. When Hall died, his daughter Anna took possession of Sylvonia and her children, whom she hired out. On New Years Day at the age of seven, Randal was hired out, leaving his mother and siblings. In his new surroundings he was permitted to attend school and learned to spell. After three years, he was taken to Nashville where he was hired to another man named Garite. Later, Charles Hall, a relative of Anna and Major Hall, secured Randal and sought to take him to Kansas. Randal hid, and did not go west. Instead he was purchased by a man named Vandervall with whom he was living. Vandervall had a son, John, who continued Randal's lessons - which Randal paid for by rail splitting. At the age of 15, Randal converted to the Baptist religion and at the age of 16 began preaching. He also continued to work on constructing railroads.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p572-578Lovett, Bobby L.

University of Arkansas Press. 1999 p12-13, 136, 147 He married a woman named Martha Nicholson of Hillbrook and was allowed to live with her. When the man who hired him learned he could read and write, he was abused and ran away, returning to his master and persuading him to change his work. Randal was hired out to work in Nashville, paying his master $200 per year for the privilege. This situation was not satisfactory to the master, and he decided to sell Randal south. Randal desired to purchase himself, and a price of $1800 was agreed, and Randal eventually succeeded in raising the money. Martha was the daughter of her master, and when Martha's master died and she was sold to her deceased master's grandson, Nelson Nicholson. Randal hired Martha from Nelson until, just before the American Civil War (1861-1865), Nelson decided to purchase Randal to allow the two to remain together with him, as Nelson was planning to leave Nashville. When the war broke out, Nelson did not leave town afterall, and he hired Martha and Randal out. Before the end of the war, Martha and Randal and their child, James N., were purchased by a Mr. McKenzie. Later career In January 1862, Vandavall was elected pastor of the African Mission of the white Spring Street Baptist Church, although when the Union Army arrived in February, the Spring Street church dissolved, and the African Mission with it. The church reformed with a white Northern minister, Daniel W. Phillips, who recruited Vandavall to aid him in creating a college to train black preachers. In 1866 this school became the Nashville Normal and Theological Institution with Phillips as president and Vandavall as a trustee. It was later known as Roger Williams University. After freedom came at the end of the war (1865), Vandavall was legally married to his wife by his friend Rev. Phillips. In 1866, Vandavall formed the Second Colored Baptist Church, later called the First Baptist Church of East Nashville. Services were initially held in Vandavall's home before moving to old Union Army barracks, and then to a building called McClure's Hall. Vandervall was a very successful preacher, organizing a total of nine churches. He was a life member of the American Baptist Publication Society and president of the Tennessee Sunday School Convention for many years. He also served terms as president of the Baptist State convention. He was closely connected to Roger Williams University throughout his life and received from it a Doctorate in Divinity in 1886. Vandavall was also a noted teacher. In 1880, the city opened a school in a four-room house on Wetmore and Spring Streets and named it for Vandavall.

Introduced at the time of rising global sustainability movement in the 90s, the term proposes a new way of looking at design with recycled, re-used and sustainable materials and identifies 4 pathways to approach design to achieve this result of added value. The first mention of the term \\"Design with Memory\\" in the U.S. was in the ARCADE magazine (1997). In an article discussing winning entries to the first 3 rounds of the Competition Architect Johnson said, ‚ÄúWe have come to call it 'Designing with Memory' because sustainable design is based on the recognition of our interdependent relationship with the natural world around us ‚Äì something we forgot when we had designed products and architecture with the idea that their materials could be wasted and landfilled. It is also 'Designing with Memory' because it means thinking about where the materials come from, how they are used, and where they will go next.‚Äù The first mention of the term ‚ÄúDesign with Memory‚Äú in Japan was at the Japanese Design Research Center exhibit in Niigata, Japan (1999). With heightening global interest in sustainable development during this time, the IDRA competitions organized under the theme of Design with Memory were funded in part by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the exhibits in Japan were part of a national program of design education with associated seminars. It is said to be the first international design competition under the theme of sustainability to be sponsored by the Japanese government.  History  Origin of the term The Design Resource Awards Competition (1994-2003), was begun by Johnson Design Studio with a grant from the State of Washington‚Äôs Clean Washington Center with the goal of encouraging the development of commercially viable products made from recycled and sustainably harvested materials. The State of Washington‚Äôs pioneering recycling programs were gathering lots of mixed waste paper, construction debris, plastics, metals and glass, but there were very few products being made with these materials. One of the main challenges to using the materials was their cost - successful new products would need to be of relatively high value. The Competition challenged designers with the problem of making high value products with what were viewed as relatively low quality, low value materials. While the Competition began as a local effort, within the first year over half the entries came from outside the United States and the name was revised to the International Design Resource Awards (IDRA) Competition. The Competition highlighted that such challenge was not unique to Washington State, but was a global issue which many governmental and environmental institutions around the world were looking to solve (see major donor list below). It is believed to be the first international design competition focused on encouraging the development of sustainable product design and architecture. The core criteria for designer's submissions for IDRA competitions were: * Contain a high degree of post-consumer recycled content or sustainably harvested material * Demonstrate the ability to add value to the recycled or sustainable material and to increase its usage * Be designed for future re-use or recyclability * Be suitable for commercial production The Competition was open to student and professional entrants. The award was given out in three categories of student, professional, and honorable mention. Typically the Competition had five jurors from various backgrounds ‚Äì education, marketing, material sciences, architecture, and product design. Early advocates and supporters of sustainable design from across these disciplines became jurors for the competition. Particularly well known Jurors included Wendy Brawer, Pliny Fisk III, Arunas Oslapas, and Fumikazu Masuda. The term \\"Design with Memory\\" came about after 4th year of the Competition in 1999, when a Japanese journalist Hiroyuki Kushida working on the Whole Earth Project in Tokyo, saw some of the award winners from the first three rounds of the Competition during a trip to U.S., and arranged for an exhibit to travel to Japan. While visiting the first exhibit in Japan, Architect Johnson met Professor Masuda for the first time and discovered that the phrase ‚Äúsustainable design‚Äù translates in Japanese to ‚Äúdesign with memory‚Äù (Ë®òÊÜ∂„ÅÆ„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥), and that this phrase also translated well back to English in the ways we thought about sustainable design - \\"Where do materials come from and where do they go next?‚Äù (Johnson interview, Sotokoto 2003) This collaboration subsequently led to a year long series of seminars for professional industrial designers and support for the 5th and 6th rounds of the Competition was provided by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) together with other industry supporters such as Living Design Center OZONE in Tokyo. From 1994 to 2003 the Competition received over 1200 entries from over 20 countries with the 5th and 6th rounds of the Competition attracting more than 450 entries. The winning entries were published in various design books and magazines around the world. This story of \\"Spinning garbage into gold\\" was featured in various fashion and lifestyle magazines such as House Beautiful, Elle Decor, and An-An. It was one of the pioneering initiatives that aimed to position products made from recycled material in an elevated way by exhibiting them in high-end design shops, galleries, and museums. Kintsugi, Japanese art of repairing broken pottery Origin of the concept An iconic example used by Professor Masuda and Architect Johnson to illustrate the historical precedent for ‚ÄúDesign with Memory‚Äù is the ancient Japanese tea cup which has been broken and visibly repaired (also see kintsugi, wabi-sabi). \\"An 'old' value in eco design can be seen in an ancient Japanese tea ceremony cup that was broken and carefully repaired. This care and attention gives the cup added value as it becomes a cultural icon.‚Äù During the 5th and 6th rounds of the Competition the phrase came to represent a new design methodology for designing with recycled, re-used and sustainably harvested materials. It is based on making elements of the product‚Äôs materials and use self-evident, and thereby raising the value of the product for the user. ‚ÄúThrough interaction with the entrants and jurors this phrase has grown to include complementary levels of meaning. For example, 'Design with Memory' could mean adding value to a design by employing the memory of the material‚Äôs previous use in the new work. It could also mean adding value to the project by actively employing the memory of the user, or, perhaps, the memory of the material or product itself in the new work.‚Äù  Application  Green Peace Activist Bag \\"Design with Memory of the User\\" category award winning example Metal Woven Basket \\"Design with Memory of the Material\\" category award winning example Recycled Porcelain ware \\"Design with Memory of the Product\\" category award winning example Compostable keyboard \\"Design with Memory of Nature\\" category award winning example The Japanese industrial design professor and American architect duo identified 4 pathways to accomplish Designing with Memory and introduced them as focus categories in the 5th and 6th rounds of IDRA Competition. Each pathway was illustrated through examples of award winning entries from the Competition: # Design with Memory of the User - The goal is to reduce the amount of consumption by making products useful and desirable for a longer period of time. The method employed is to develop a strong relationship between the user and the product. A winning entry example of this strategy was the GreenPeace Activist Bag. It used a smoked natural rubber material coated on used sugar sacks made by members of an indigenous community in the Amazon delta as part of a carrier bag. Users knew every day that this product was made to make the native rubber trees more valuable standing than cut down for grazing and thus helping support their local community. All parts of the bag were compostable, so when it did wear out, it could go back into the earth. # # Design with Memory of the Material ‚ÄìThis strategy is for finding successful paths to re-use materials. Materials that are discarded can be a rich resource for new product development. Adding value to the material through artistic design is the key to using them successfully. A winning entry example of this strategy is the elegant baskets woven from discarded industrial metal strapping. # # Design with Memory of the Product ‚ÄìThe goal is to create a cycle of product, and product re-use, into the future. A winning example of this approach is by a porcelain product company that developed a way to regrind discarded and their broken porcelain products and form it into a new product. To illustrate to the purchaser the nature of the product they incorporated their traditional design motifs blended into the new forms. # # Design with Memory of Nature - The goal with this strategy is to make the product self-evidently integrating with natural cycles. A winning entry example of this strategy is the compostable computer keyboard. Technological advances are rapid and cause plastic products to be ‚Äúout of date‚Äù quickly - leading to increased pressure on recycling programs and landfills. To address this problem, the keyboard keys and body are instead made from carrot and celery fibers bound with a starch based binder ‚Äì 100% compostable after the electronic sheet and chord are removed.

It was written by Lizzie Molyneux and Wendy Molyneux, and directed by Tyree Dillihay. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 8, 2015. In the episode, The Belchers' Thanksgiving festivities are put in jeopardy when Bob finds himself staying with an injured Aunt Gayle during a snowstorm. Plot Bob is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Linda cannot drive in the snow and Gayle is on crutches after she injured her ankle, so Bob has to drive to Gayle's to pick her up for Thanksgiving dinner. The car gets snowed in and Bob has to figure a way to transport Gayle, her crutches, her cat, Mr. Business, and slide back to the Belcher apartment. Linda and the kids must do the cooking. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V.

This is where the show‚Äôs commitment to and specificity of character pays off. This isn‚Äôt just the story of a grump and an eccentric tromping through the snow. It‚Äôs the story of Bob and Gayle, with all that suggests from everything we‚Äôve learned about them in episodes past. That makes all the difference.\\" Sean Fitz-Gerald from Vulture gave the episode a mixed review by saying, \\"Although the premise of the episode was predictable, the writing and voice acting, and all the beautiful quirkiness therein, saved \\"Bob Sled\\" from becoming a forgettable episode. Sure, it's another 20-minute installment of Bob-Thanksgiving sadism. Sure, most of the Bob we saw in this episode was the Bob we've seen in many other episodes, especially the Thanksgiving ones. (Truly nothing new there.) But the zany exploration of Gayle made it worthwhile: We learned she's an underrated manipulator, she's great at making toasts, and, most important, she's either really into Mr. Frond or her infatuation with Bob is yet another psychotic joke just for her own amusement.\\" The episode received a 1.4 rating and was watched by a total of 3.13 million people.

It was directed by Brian Loschiavo and written by Greg Thompson. Its guest stars are Samantha Bee as Nurse Liz, Brian Huskey as Regular Sized Rudy, Bobby Tisdale as Zeke, Jenny Slate as Tammy Larsen, David Herman as Mr. Frond and Marshmallow, Tim Meadows as Mike the mailman, Billy Eichner as Mr. Ambrose and Laura and Sarah Silverman who voice Andy and Ollie Pesto respectively. It first aired in the United States on Fox Network on March 13, 2016. In this episode, the Belcher children have to deal with a lice outbreak at school where Tina assists the nurse Liz while their parents implement new bar stool cushions at the restaurant.  Plot  Tina Belcher assists the school nurse Liz in order to get a girl scout badge. Louise fakes a fever to avoid a pop quiz and is sent to the nurse's office. Tammy Larson, Zeke, Gene Belcher and Regular Sized Rudy also go there for multiple reasons. Tammy has a new hat she wears at school and the children, except Tina, try out her hat. Louise is forced to wear it over her bunny-ears hat. Liz notices that Tammy scratches her head and after a closer look she diagnoses head lice on Tammy and on everyone else who wore her hat. Liz then declares her office to be quarantined, so nobody is allowed to leave. Liz and Tina each wear a rubber glove on their heads for protection against the lice. Tina takes Tammy's mobile phone and looks at the selfies, searching for all the other people Tammy had head contact with. Those children, including Lenny DeStefano and the twins Andy and Ollie Pesto, are paged to come to the nurse's office via the school's television station. Liz goes to her computer to look for a cure and later announces that the only effective cure is to shave the infected kids' heads bald and to burn all their hats. The children do not want to let this happen to them, especially Louise fears that she will not only lose her hair but also her beloved bunny-ears hat, which is irreplaceable to her. Mr. Frond comes into the nurse's office because he heard the students screaming. After Liz explains that there is a lice outbreak, he suggests to call the parents and sent the children home, but Liz is afraid that they have \\"super lice\\" which parents cannot handle properly. Tina notices that Mr. Frond also took a photo with Tammy and therefore is infected, too. Liz starts to shave his head against his will but has problems doing it because his hair is really thick. So she decides to shave the kids first, starting with Louise. Louise takes the rubber glove off of Liz's head and makes Tammy's head touch Liz's, therefore Liz shaves her own head bald. The students, including Tina, manage to escape the office and run away. Louise and Tammy head for a different direction and hide in the school library. Louise takes a medical encyclopedia from a bookshelf to learn about lice. Both hear via the public address system that all the other infected children were caught and Liz is going to shave them. After the librarian, Mr. Ambrose, left, Louise takes Tammy and the book she just read to the nurse's office because she has a plan. There Louise explains that Tammy has dandruff instead and shows Liz the page in the encyclopedia saying that dandruff can be misdiagnosed as head lice but Liz notes that Tammy has both. Then Tina notices that Liz usually wears glasses and tells the nurse to read the book Louise brought. After Liz says she does not need to read it, Tina makes it clear Liz cannot read without her glasses and therefore would not be able to see any lice. Liz discloses that she made up the lice outbreak so the children are free to leave the office. Meanwhile Bob and Linda Belcher get new cushions installed for the bar stools in their restaurant but the new ones make fart noises every time someone sits on them. They call the producer but get told that the cushions just do that until they are broken in. Then a man comes inside and says that he decided to organize a funeral meal in there, so they have to break them in very quickly. Mike the mailman has the idea of giving free beer to everyone who sits on a stool and breaks in the new cushion which Bob and Linda do.  Reception  Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" and wrote that it \\"is a solid episode, and very definitely a more conventional entry than last week‚Äôs rambling ‚ÄúSacred Couch,‚Äù but it feels like it misses a crucial beat in its storytelling.\\" It would have been a better plot if Louise was \\"blase about the whole quarantine thing, reasoning that a couple hours with a daffy nurse is still better than taking that pop quiz or just going to class in general. Such a response would feel just as valid and in-character as what we actually get here, and it then would mean something when Louise realizes she might not get out of here with her bunny ears intact.\\" He also noted that the \\"main plot is helped considerably by Samantha Bee‚Äôs nicely unhinged performance as Nurse Liz, as Bee makes her character‚Äôs frustrations with the kids‚Äô non-maladies simultaneously sympathetic and disquieting. It‚Äôs difficult to blame her for being annoyed by the kids‚Äô transparent abuse of the nurse‚Äôs office, yet from the start she hints at how little she cares about anything other than furthering her own inherently go-nowhere career.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 6) episodes ","title":"Lice Things Are Lice"},{"id":"52117210","text":"\\"House of 1000 Bounces\\" is the 11th episode of the sixth season of the animated comedy series Bob's Burgers and the overall 99th episode, and is written by Mike Benner and directed by Tyree Dillihay.

However, once they arrive, they find out that there was a mix-up and Rudy doesn't have a bounce house. The company thought there was a double booking because another party at the park also ordered a bounce house. But Louise quickly comes up with a plan to steal the bounce house. With the help of Sasha, who happens to be the cousin of Dahlia the party girl, the kids push the bounce house into the lake. Since no one from Dahlia's party will go into the lake, the kids get to bounce to their hearts‚Äô delight. Until Dahlia and her friends find boats to row out to the floating bounce house. Shortly after they let all of the air out of the inflatable, the park ranger comes by and ‚Äúarrests‚Äù everyone at Rudy's party. At the ranger station, Rudy starts crying because this isn't what he wanted for his party. He just wanted to make spoon puppets and act out his script.

Meanwhile at the restaurant, Bob, Linda and Teddy are dealing with a pigeon that managed to get into the store and Bob is freaking out. It is later revealed that he had a fear of birds when he was young. Linda and Teddy point out that his traumatic memory is nothing more than a scene from the movie The Birds. Bob quickly gets over his fear and tries to get the bird out of the store himself. Sadly, the bird got himself covered in olive oil, leaving him unable to fly. The local animal rescue tells them to bathe the pigeon. For some reason, Bob thinks this means he has to get into the tub with the oily animal, making him less afraid of the piegon.

Written by Steven Davis and Kelvin Yu, the episode features guest appearances from actors Rob Huebel, Kumail Nanjiani, and Keegan-Michael Key, as well as appearances by recurring guest stars Pamela Adlon, Ken Jeong, Tim Meadows, and Jenny Slate. Its main plot sees Gene Belcher (Eugene Mirman), Louise Belcher (Kristen Schaal), and Tina (Dan Mintz) getting into a prank war which causes Bob to end up in a sticky situation, where he learns that a journalist is coming to the restaurant to do a story on it, and the whole town ends up getting involved. Although the episode was the 107th in airing order, \\"Glued, Where's My Bob?\\" was the 100th in production order; since 100 episodes is a milestone for any television series, Fox promoted the episode as the series' 100th. Creator Loren Bouchard didn't want to make the episode anything too special, or rather different. Instead, he and the show's creative team decided they wanted to make what seemed like a \\"quintessential\\" episode. The episode originally aired on May 22, 2016 on Fox, drawing an audience of 2.04 million viewers, and was met with critical acclaim from both critics and fans, who have praised it for its plot, character development, and the overall quality of the show's success. Due to the high praise that the episode received, this episode was submitted for, and received, two nominations at the 44th Annie Awards for Best General Audience Animated TV/Broadcast Production and Outstanding Achievement, Music in an Animated TV/Broadcast Production. Plot The kids are in the middle of a prank war where they \\"goop\\" each other by covering various things with items such as grape jelly, hummus, and toothpaste. While this is going on Bob gets a call from Skip Marooch, the celebrity chef who Bob nearly defeated in a burger making competition, who tells him that a local food magazine titled \\"Coasters\\" is coming over to interview him for their \\"hidden gems\\" segment as a favor to Skip, a fan of Bob's cooking. Bob is to be featured on the front page. Unfortunately, Bob falls victim to the biggest prank in the goop war when he sits in something Louise spread on the toilet intending to get Gene. Further complicating matters is the revelation that the \\"goop\\" Louise used is a highly concentrated adhesive concocted by Teddy that he calls his \\"sticky spackle.\\" Once word gets out of Bob's predicament, the whole town and the local news team descend on Bob's Burgers to try to get a view of him. Teddy is called upon to free Bob, only to further embarrass Bob when he breaks down the bathroom door and exposes him to the crowd. After a curtain is hung over the door, Teddy goes to work applying nail polish remover to the adhesive, while Louise repeatedly claims zero responsibility for her role in what happened. Once it becomes clear that Teddy is unable to get Bob free, Louise places a call to Dr. Yap. Since his job as a dentist involves heavy use of adhesives and solvents, he tells a skeptical Bob that he is the best person for the job at that exact moment. Yap decides the best way to free Bob, given their limited resources and time, is to inject Novocain into his butt and pull him off the toilet with a rope. Unfortunately, it does not work and Bob remains stuck. Shortly thereafter, the crew from Coasters shows up and, seeing Bob's predicament, decide that they will not be featuring him or the restaurant in the article as they do not believe him to be interesting enough. Bob, having been struggling to maintain his composure throughout, finally snaps and says that the whole situation is a perfect reflection of the daily grind at Bob's Burgers and kicks the two men out of the restaurant. As they are leaving, Louise stops the crew members and tells them off. In the process she finally admits she is the one to blame for what happened to Bob, and Teddy leads the restaurant in a chant of \\"Toilet Bob\\" in support of him. Bob is finally able to free himself from the toilet and stand up (albeit briefly), which results in cheers from the gathered crowd. One month later, Bob receives a copy of Coasters from Mike the mailman and discovers that he was featured in the magazine after all. The writers praised Bob for the way he ran his business and how it seemed to fit into the town's way of life. Despite the fact that a picture of him stuck to the toilet was published as part of the piece, the article encourages people to stop in and ask to hear the story for themselves and wishes the restaurant well. While Bob is not too pleased about having the toilet incident published, he is happy that Coasters put out a positive piece on Bob's Burgers and even happier that the article appears to have given the restaurant some much needed publicity and customers. Production Series creator Loren Bouchard didn't want to make the 100th episode a big clich√©d special like many series' do. \\"Glued, Where's My Bob?\\" was written by Steven Davis and Kelvin Yu and directed by Bernard Derriman. Upon hearing the writers' pitch of the episode, series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be \\"such an immediately appealing story\\" and \\"a great way to have Louise peek over the other side of adolescence and look into the abyss\\". In an interview with TV Insider, Bouchard came up with the idea of having the episode to be centered around Bob by explaining of \\"We have this ensemble cast, and we always try to vary the episodes so that, to an extent, an episode might focus on one character's journey or the relationship between two characters, like Linda and Louise in \\"Mother Daughter Laser Razor\\"‚Äîor Bob and Gene in the one where he goes and returns a remote control helicopter. We try to spread those out so that over the course of a season or even a half a season, you feel like you've gotten roughly equal time with all the characters. Generally speaking, when you get to a Bob-centric episode, it should feel like just about time that you'd just be wanting it, like we haven't had one in a little while. Same for all the other characters.\\" Production of the episode began sometime in 2015, as it was revealed in San Diego Comic-Con. Cast member Kristen Schaal explained the plot of the episode by saying, \\"Someone gets stuck to a toilet.\\" Reception \\"Glued, Where's My Bob?\\" received universal acclaim by both critics and audiences. The episode was watched by 2.04 million viewers and received a 0.9/3 Nielsen rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, becoming the fourth most-watched program of the Fox Sunday block for the night. Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A, writing, \\"It‚Äôs the kind of episode that could easily work as a series ender [...] as the story uses Bob‚Äôs escalating predicament as an excuse to bring back as many townspeople as it can cram into the restaurant for the big climactic moment.\\" Molly Freeman of Screenrant praised the episode and overall the sixth season, by saying, \\"All in all, ‚ÄòGlued, Where‚Äôs My Bob?‚Äô is an excellent cap to a season of Bob's Burgers as well as its milestone 100th episode (though, that's according to production codes, while it's the 107th episode to have aired). Altogether season 6 of Bob's Burgers maintained the balance of comedy and heart that has made the series so popular among fans.\\" Ray Richmond of TheWrap praised the episode and overall the quality of the show after its milestone by writing, \\"Bob‚Äôs Burgers has already exceeded the runs of quite a few classic TV programs. The Larry Sanders Show made it to only 89 episodes, The Sopranos to 86, Downton Abbey to just 51. So in that sense, it has more than earned its keep.

Its guest stars are Betsy Sodaro as Jackie the crossing guard, Billy Eichner as Mr. Ambrose, Kevin Kline as Calvin Fischoeder, Jay Johnston as Jimmy Pesto, David Herman as Mr. Frond, Jenny Slate as Tammy Larsen and Bobby Tisdale as Zeke. It originally aired in the United States on Fox Network on October 23, 2016. In this Halloween episode, Tina Belcher thinks that she is a witch and casts spells on people, while Bob Belcher tries to find out who steals his jack-o'-lanterns.  Plot  After Tammy overhears Tina's idea for the school's Halloween costume contest, she steals it and declares that it was always her idea, not Tina's. So Tina needs another idea to win. During lunch she comes up with the idea of a \\"sand-witch\\" meaning a witch between two slices of bread. She goes to the school library to research witches and bread. The librarian Mr. Ambrose tells her that witches look like everyone else and that he is one. He says that Tina should be a witch, not just dressing as one. He gives her a spell book for casting a spell on the contest to win it. That night, Tina casts different spells including one to win the contest and a love spell on Jimmy Pesto Jr. After some of them seem to work, she thinks that she actually is a witch. Tina starts to wear a black t-shirt and a black choker necklace and has a much bolder attitude. She also casts a spell on Jackie the crossing guard, but Jackie takes her barrette and places a curse on her. After Tina talks to Mr. Ambrose about the curse and he explains to her that Jackie is an evil witch, she is afraid that something bad will happen during the costume contest, so her siblings Gene and Louise have to look after her. At the contest hosted by Mr. Frond the guidance counsellor Tina sees Jackie and thinks that she might fall off the runway, but her siblings are there to catch her. She realizes that witchcraft is not real and that it was just random coincidence that made it appear as though her spells worked. She publicly apologizes to Jackie and renounces her dabbling in witchcraft. Both Tina and Tammy fall off the runway with Tina landing on Tammy. Jackie gives Tina back her barrette and removes the curse. Regular Sized Rudy wins the costume contest. Meanwhile, Bob makes several jack-o'-lanterns with a burger on them, but all of them are stolen. He tries to find out who it is and suspects his rival Jimmy Pesto. Later he sees his landlord Mr. Fischoeder taking his pumpkin and he asks him what he does with all of them. Mr. Fischoeder tells him to come to his mansion so he can show it to him. The Belcher family visits their landlord that evening and there are all the jack-o'-lanterns from the town with lights inside. Linda says that they look much better than on the sidewalk and the children get a picture taken with the pumpkins.  Reception  Alasdair Wilkins from The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" and wrote that \\"Mr. Ambrose is such a bizarrely wonderful asset for Bob‚Äôs Burgers. He‚Äôs technically an adult, which lends his absurd suggestions and demonstrably awful advice a thin sheen of credibility. ‚ÄúTeen-A-Witch‚Äù doesn‚Äôt ask the audience to take even remotely seriously that Tina is an actual witch, but it does need to provide something that can let us suspend disbelief and not believe this is the dumbest plotline imaginable.\\" He also noted that this \\"episode also makes excellent use of Tina.

In the episode, the Belchers find themselves in a full-blown investigation when Bob secures a new meat provider who claims to save clients money on their orders. Plot Jimmy Pesto arrives at Bob's Burgers to brag about his new meat provider, Jack Conway, who saves him a substantial amount of money. Bob is interested and hires Conway; the two take an instant liking to each other, and Teddy and the customers enjoy the quality of the meat, which Conway sells as USDA prime beef. However, Hugo the health inspector arrives and informs Bob that Conway is in fact selling horse meat ‚Äì a revelation which angers Tina and Teddy, though Teddy quickly takes a liking to the new product. Hugo offers to leave the restaurant alone if Bob aids him in a sting operation, which Hugo describes as \\"way out of his jurisdiction\\" that he is performing to spite the FDA. Hugo straps a toy microphone and a tape recorder to Bob's chest, telling Bob he needs two things on tape: a record of the transaction, and a record of Conway claiming his product as USDA prime. However, various mishaps prevent Bob from collecting the information for Hugo, and the restaurant walk-in is soon filled with unnecessary purchases of horse meat. Conway invites the Belchers to his birthday party at his house, where they meet his pregnant wife. Tina tries to prevent Jimmy Jr. from eating the hot dogs the Conways serve, which she suspects contain horse meat. Bob once again tries to collect the information from Conway. Conway, finally suspicious, invites Bob into his house and tells him he knows about the sting. After inadvertently revealing the conversation is going straight to tape, Bob steals the tape and Conway chases him through the party to retrieve it. Bob gets stuck in a bush but manages to throw the tape to Hugo; Conway is fined and begins selling beef. Nonetheless, Conway maintains no hard feelings towards the Belchers and drops by the restaurant to announce he's writing a book on his experience in the meat industry: \\"Friday Night Meats\\". Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V.

Tina doesn‚Äôt necessarily get her big revenge moment against Conway, though she does at least get to give him a little piece of her mind, which is probably more in keeping with this episode‚Äôs sense of stakes anyway.

In this episode Tina Belcher has detention and Bob and Linda Belcher are in Gerald's office, so Gene and Louise Belcher are on their own when they have to deal with Logan Bush.  Plot  When Tina overhears that a boy she likes has detention at school, she gets detention on purpose by throwing some books to the ground. Thus, Linda and Bob have no-one to babysit Gene and Louise when they have to meet their accountant Gerald, because it is the last day to do their taxes. At Gerald's office, Bob, Linda and Gerald accidentally eat some marijuana cookies, leaving them stranded at the office until they sober up.

Louise throws it, but accidentally hits Logan, who wants to get revenge. He tries to get into the apartment to do a professional wrestling move called the \\"Reverse Norwegian Stink Hold\\" that will painfully force Louise to smell his armpit. He calls her saying he is already in the house and throws a shoe into the kitchen making Gene and Louise think he is really there. They flee the house, and just as he planned, Logan can now get to them, chasing them to the Lobsterfest from the episode of the same name. Gene and Louise disguise themselves by putting on some shrimp costumes, but the upper parts of it falls off. They hide in a warehouse, but Logan can see Louise's bunny ears from her hat. When Logan is about to do the wrestling move, she begins to cry from fear and Gene places himself in front of her to protect his sister, so Logan ends up doing the move on Gene instead. Louise is horrified and honored that Gene took her place watching Gene suffer for her and thanks her elder brother for sticking up for her and they hug. Meanwhile Bob, Linda and Gerald are still high and they build a fort out of some cushions to hide from Gerald's next client. Bob and Linda reveal to Gerald that they do not find his constant jokes very funny, but convince him to keep doing them if they make him happy and improve on them. Tina is in detention and dreams about being together with the boy she likes but cannot see him because another boy sits in between.  Reception  Alasdair Wilkins from The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" and wrote that \\"[g]etting Tina out of the picture allows the show to focus on just Gene and Louise, and the latter‚Äôs reaction when Bob and Linda decide the babysitting arrangement is telling: Who would ever think of Gene as an older brother? Sure, he‚Äôs the epitome of a middle child, but that implies both Tina and Louise are there to keep him in that center spot. When it‚Äôs just Louise and Gene, the age difference feels incidental, with them operating more as unhinged partners in crime than any recognizable spin on an older brother and younger sister.\\" He also noted that the \\"moment where Gene reluctantly stands between Louise and Logan is genuinely touching, all the more so because the episode doesn‚Äôt remotely hide Gene‚Äôs reluctance.

It was released online by BBC Three on 12 November 2016. The episode was written by series creator Patrick Ness and directed by Philippa Langdale. It forms a two-part story with the previous episode, \\"Co- Owner of a Lonely Heart\\". Class follows four students of Coal Hill Academy and their alien teacher, as they deal with various alien threats. Following the events of the previous episode, April (Sophie Hopkins), accompagned by Ram (Fady Elsayed), is now on the planet of the Shadow Kin, hunting for their king Corakinus (Paul Marc Davis). Meanwhile, their friends and families work together to try to stop flesh-eating petals to take over the city, and Charlie (Greg Austin) is faced with the possibility of using the Cabinet of Souls, thus destroying the souls of his entire race, to either destroy the petals and save earth, or wipe out the Shadow Kin to avenge his and Miss Quill (Katherine Kelly)'s races, thus committing genocide. The episode's title, which refers to April's braveness to face Corakinus and the fact they share the same heart, is also a reference to Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart. The episode was positively received by critics, who praised its acting and character development.  Plot  Dorothea Ames tells Quill that she and the Governors believe Quill may be an asset in repelling alien incursions. Ames reveals that the Cabinet of Souls myth is real, and offers to free Quill from the arn if Quill forces Charlie to use the weapon to destroy the petals. Charlie, Matteusz, and April's parents arrive at Coal Hill; Dorothea explains the threat. Charlie, Matteusz, Quill, and Ames go to the Cabinet; Quill asks Charlie to avenge their peoples by destroying the Shadow Kin instead of the petals. Charlie refuses to use the weapon, as it would destroy his people's souls and leave him with no identity. Ames threatens Charlie and Matteusz with a gun; Matteusz incapacitates her. Tanya updates Varun; they join April's parents at Coal Hill and Tanya defuses the adults' argument over Ram and April's relationship. The petals begin to devour humans. April and Ram search the Underneath, the Shadow Kin planet, to find and kill Corakinus, though this will also kill April. April's connection to Corakinus grants her Shadow Kin knowledge and the ability to track him, but Corakinus can also sense her. April confronts and defeats Corakinus, and April's connection to Jackie enables April to open a passage to Earth. Huw convinces April not to execute Corakinus, and the humans return to Earth. April realizes she is King of the Shadow Kin; she orders the Shadow Kin to imprison Corakinus, destroy the petals, return to the Underneath, and destroy the passage. Charlie finally activates the Cabinet but stops when the petals are destroyed. He admits he doesn't know whom he would have targeted. Ames admits to Quill that the Governors expected April to save Earth, and that the petals shared one soul; her goal was to study Charlie and Quill. Ames reaffirms the offer to free Quill. Corakinus destroys the anchor, reverting his connection to April to its former state; April loses her powers and is no longer King. April affirms that Huw must stay away unless she or Jackie seeks contact; April helps Jackie take her first step.  Production  The episode was directed by Philippa Langdale, who also directed the first half of the two-parter, \\"Co-Owner of a Lonely Heart\\". It premiered on 12 November 2016 at 10am. The episode is scheduled for broadcast in the United States in early 2017 on BBC America.  Reception  The episode was met with positive reception from critics. April, Charlie, Miss Quill, and Matteusz's character development was praised, as were Sophie Hopkins and Katherine Kelly's performances as April and Quill. Some, however, felt that the episode lacked focus and had tone issues. In a positive review, Flickering Myth criticized that the episode felt \\"almost like a perfunctory piece, dedicated more to establishing important details about future episodes, rather than being concerned with how it works as an hour of drama in its own right\\". However, he highly praised Greg Austin and Katherine Kelly's performances as Charlie and Miss Quill, and their respective characters' development. He also noted the series' \\"admirable commitment to intimate storytelling, emphasising the importance of emotional support and mental well-being ‚Äì all while breaking the typically prescribed gender roles one might associate with such actions\\". He gave the episode a rating of 7 out of 10. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy, who gave the previous episode a mixed review, was more positive about \\"Brave-ish Heart\\", considering it a satisfying conclusion. He praised the character development, and Kelly's performance as Miss Quill. He however was critical of the handling of the show's sci-fi aspect, stating \\"while Class nails the emotional beats, it fudges the fiddly sci-fi details. The show continues to throw fantastical nonsense at the viewer (How did April heal her Mum? Why did she suddenly lose her powers? How do the Shadowkin turn the petals into shadow?) and just demands we accept it\\". In a positive review, Alex Moreland of Cult Box highly praised Sophie Hopkins' performance as April, calling it a \\"tour de force\\". Loulsa Mellor of Den of Geek, who gave the previous episode a positive review, was more critical of \\"Brave-ish Heart\\", especially for its tone, stating \\"keeping emotions running that high without skidding off into histrionics is a delicate balance, and one Class didn‚Äôt quite pull off here\\" [...] The will to counter tension with light-heartedness was there, but the zingers were drowned out by the deafening drumbeat of April‚Äôs Very Serious Quest\\". He also thought that the fifth episode of the series was too early to have April accomplish such impressive feature. He however stated that it was \\"an emphatic episode, start to finish. There was no let-up in its urgent intensity\\".

Under the encouragement of artist Lionel Edwards, King went on to study at Salisbury College of Art. King worked in water colours, oil, and pencil. He was also known to sculpt. Career King rose to fame for his illustrations for the ‚ÄòIllustrated London News‚Äô and ‚ÄòHorse and Hound‚Äô Magazine. He often worked with former Horse and Hound Editor Michael Clayton, producing illustrations for Michael's weekly column ‚ÄúFoxford‚Äôs Hunting Diary‚Äù. In 1984 Clayton and King produced a book titled \\"The Golden Thread\\" which had illustrations of many hunts across the UK. King also illustrated books by Jim Meads, Robin Page and many others. King became a founding member of the Society of Equestrian Artists. He became known for the quote that hunting scenes are ‚Äú90 per cent landscape‚Äù High-profile work and patrons In later life King went on to exhibit with both the Royal Institute and the Society of Wildlife Artists. From 1966 onward he held at least ten 'one man exhibits' and many shared exhibits. His magnum opus was a commission for Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, Vice-President of the UAE and Emir of Dubai, which comprised a 16 ft by 8 ft painting of 'Dubai Millennium', the Sheikh's racehorse and winner of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. The painting was considered to be the largest equestrian painting produced in the UK for at least 200 years.

Biography Hirayama was born in 1923 in Tokyo. Her parents were lawyers and she had a good education. One of her first musical influences was the Japanese composer Fumio Hayasaka. Hirayama studied music at Tokyo University of the Arts, Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Accademia Chigiana in Siena and at the Mozarteum Salzburg; she soon discovered her affinity for contemporary music. In the early 1950s she moved to Italy. There she met Giacinto Scelsi in 1957, at a concert of Scelsi's neighbor, but she did not initially know that he was a composer. When Scelsi heard Hirayama singing old Japanese songs at a concert, he asked her if she would be interested in his music. They began to work together in 1959. The first work of Scelsi and Hirayama, \\"H√¥\\", debuted in 1961 at the music festival \\"Nuova Conconanza\\". He later dedicated his ‚ÄúCanti del Caprircorno‚Äù (1962‚Äì1972) to her. Hirayama owned a full score of \\"Canti del Capricorno\\" with Scelsi's handwritten comments and played an important role in the origination process of the 20-song musical cycle. In 2006, at the age of 82, she decided to record the \\"Canti del Capricorno\\" again.

He specialised in the theory of knowledge and logic but later became interested in psychoanalysis. He served in the United States Army during the First World War and wrote an unpublished memoir of his experiences.  Early life and marriage  Ralph Monroe Eaton was born on June 28, 1892, in Stockton, California. He was educated at the University of California, Berkeley (Litt. B., 1914) and Harvard University (A.M., 1915 and Ph.D., April 28, 1917). He married Hortense Bissell in 1922, and had a daughter Virginia Eaton Blair, in September 17, 1923. The marriage was not successful and ended in separation.  First World War  Eaton applied for admission to the Officers' Training Camp at Plattsburgh, New York in early 1917 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was posted to the 103rd Infantry Regiment and travelled to France with the 26th \\"Yankee\\" Division. He served as an officer of the line and was promoted to first lieutenant in which capacity he was responsible for the regimental supply company. His regiment saw action at Saint-Mihiel and in the Argonne.\\"Eastern Division\\", The Philosophical Review, Vol. 6 (1932), pp. 209‚Äì13. After the war, he wrote an unpublished memoir of his experiences, Backward glances of a demobilized soldier, in which he described the \\"romance in modern warfare ... a saga of vaster proportions than ever before; a tremendous drama of men and mechanisms\\" but also of his first experience of death in war when his sergeant: > ... lay like a beautiful slaughtered animal, this boy whom I had loved and > had beside me, his gashed and bloody head supported in the trembling arms of > a comrade.

Academic career  Eaton began his career as assistant in philosophy at Harvard University from 1915 to 1916, rising to assistant professor in 1926, after the interruption of military service. He was also an assistant professor at Radcliffe College. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1926, awarded for a study of the \\"philosophy, particularly the theory of knowledge in its relation to logic and metaphysics, with Professor E. Husserl and the phenomenological school of German philosophers, principally at the University of Freiburg, Germany; and for the writing in English of a critical account of the philosophy of this school\\".Ralph Monroe Eaton. John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Retrieved October 27, 2016. His first interests were in the scientific method and logic and his first book, Symbolism and Truth (1925), was an epistemological study that used logic to explore philosophy. It was compared to Wittgenstein's Tractatus in its preoccupations. In General Logic (1931), Eaton dealt with symbolic logic as well as the Aristotelian idea of logic and inductive logic. On the basis of the works, Harvard promoted Eaton to associate professor in February 1930, but soon afterwards he was found drunk in his room, depressed over the failure of his marriage, and with obscenities marked on the walls by his companions. As a result, in March the university withdrew his promotion, declared him emotionally unstable, and put him on leave until the start of the 1931‚Äì32 academic year. In addition, his contract as an assistant professor was not renewed at the end of that academic year.Kuklick, Bruce. (1977) The rise of American philosophy: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1860‚Äì1930. New Haven: Yale University Press. pp. 438‚Äì9. Around this time, he became interested in psychoanalysis and the break from his Harvard duties allowed him to translate and write a preface to Secret Ways of the Mind by Wolfgang M√ºller Kranefeldt, with an introduction by Carl Jung, which was published in early 1932. Death In April 1932, Eaton dismissed a class at Radcliffe due to dizziness. At the insistence of friends, he checked into a hospital for a night, but escaped the next morning.

She entered politics at the age of 17, campaigning on behalf of political prisoners, and becoming Madagascar's first woman municipal councilor, before becoming the first Malagasy woman to establish and lead a political party. She was a committed Marxist and co- founded the communist Congress Party for the Independence of Madagascar, which took power in 1975. In 1977 she became Madagascar's first female minister, responsible for promoting revolutionary art and culture, but lost her job in 1991 when her ministry was abolished in the course of Madagascar's return to multi-party democracy. She remained an active political campaigner and journalist until her death in 2011.  Early life and start of political career  She was born into a politically active family in the central highland city of Antananarivo. Her father was a non-commissioned officer in the French army, so her childhood saw the family moving between his postings in France, Tunisia and Mali. They moved back to Madagascar in 1942 when he died. She had aspired to become a nun in her childhood, but she took advantage of the opportunity, which few Malagasy women had at the time, to have a full education. She is regarded as a pioneer in Malagasy politics and obtained work as a shorthand typist and became involved in the 1950s with Malasy nationalist circles, at the age of 17. Rabesahala became the secretary general of the Comit√© de Solidarit√© Malgache (Malagasy Solidity Committee), an organisation that worked to defend the victims of French colonial repression following the 1947 Malagasy Uprising. She worked to secure the freedom of thousands of prisoners, writing articles for the press and attracting international attention to their plight. She liaised with left-wing members of the French National Assembly to organize petitions to the French President, Vincent Auriol, while her Solidarity Committee worked to provide support to the families of the prisoners to help them cope with the hardships that they were experiencing. Rabesahala became the first Malagasy woman to be elected as a municipal councilor in 1956 and was also the first woman to become the leader of a Malagasy political party, the Union of the Malagasy People, which she founded in 1956. She also served on the executive of the Malagasy labour union FISEMA, an affiliate of the French communist General Confederation of Labour, and served on the editorial board of Imongo Vaovao, a nationalist newspaper that took a fiercely Opposition stance to French colonial rule in Madagascar; she retained this position until 2011. Her views were unequivocally Marxist as well as nationalist. In 1958 she was a co-founder of the Congress Party for the Independence of Madagascar (AKFM), uniting five nationalist organisations.  Career in office  In 1975, fifteen years after Madagascar's independence from France, the AKFM took power and established the socialist-Marxist Democratic Republic of Madagascar (DRM). Rabesahala represented the AKFM on the National Front for the Defense of the Revolution, a coalition of six Marxist-oriented political parties. She also represented her home town of Antananarivo as a deputy in the National Assembly. In 1977, she became Madagascar's first female minister and served as minister for revolutionary art and culture until 1989, and as minister of culture from 1989 to 1991. She left office in August 1991 when the incoming government of Guy Razanamasy abolished her ministry as part of a transition to multi-party democracy. By that time the AKFM had split between communist hardliners and reformists, with the latter supporting democratic reforms. Rabesahala remained with the rump of the AKFM, which had joined forces with the DRM's former president Didier Ratsiraka under the umbrella of the Militant Movement for Malagasy Socialism in 1990. Ratsiraka's bid to become president in the 1993 elections failed and the AKFM did not win a single legislative seat. Rabesahala opposed the new government of Albert Zafy through journalism and pamphleteering, and when Ratsiraka returned to power in the 1997 election she again returned to political prominence. She advised Prime Minister Pascal Rakotomavo but resigned in 1998 after the AKFM again failed to win any seats and the administration had adopted a strategy of liberal market reforms. She worked behind the scenes to build a multi-party coalition to support President Ratsiraka and was appointed by him as a senator and one of six vice- presidents. When Marc Ravalomanana took power in 2002, she became a consistent voice of opposition to what she saw as foreign intervention and neoliberalism in his policies. She never married and had no children, saying that she preferred to \\"serve my country, rather than one person\\". She died on 27 June 2011.

Her parents were Lester and Dora (Small) Bradbury. The family moved to Fort Kent in 1892. Bradbury attended grade school in Fort Kent, and then Houlton High School in Houlton. Bradbury graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1913, and earned a master's degree from Columbia University in 1914. She then worked as a teacher, civil servant, and bookkeeper. In 1917, Bradbury married Fort Kent businessman Niles Pinkham. Political career Pinkham ran in the 1922 election, and defeated two-term Democrat William J. Audiber. Pinkham was the only one elected of nine women who ran for the legislature that year. She began serving in the Maine House of Representatives on January 3, 1923. Pinkham, a Protestant, represented an overwhelmingly Catholic region of Maine that bordered on the Canadian province of Quebec. In the legislature, Pinkham served on the Joint Committee for Public Health, the Maine Publicity Committee, the Joint Committee for Education, and on several ad hoc committees. Of the six bills she sponsored in the Maine House of Representatives, five were passed. Pinkham ran for re-election in 1924 and lost to the previous incumbent William J. Audibert. In 1926, Pinkham was elected to the Maine Senate. That year, both Pinkham and Katherine C. Allen became the first women to serve in the Maine Senate. Pinkham was re-elected to the Senate in 1928. As a senator, Pinkham held a chair on the Joint Standing Committees on Education and Public Health, and served on the Joint Standing Committees on State Prisons and Interior Waters, the Senate Committee on Bills in Second Reading, and on numerous special and ad hoc committees.

Plot  A young literature teacher, Fr√©d√©ric Game, has very \\"cool\\" methods that separate from the high school where he has just arrived. With his friends Michel, G√©rard and Francis, he decides to modify the traditions and renovate the high school. These teachers use anti-conformist educative methods : *Fr√©d√©ric attempts to inculcate the critical spirit and the draft evasion at the authority of his students. Sometimes, he absents himself and projects them a video of him on a boat giving his class. At the end, it is the students themselves who will take the initiative to move the class on the roof of the building to make him react. He will attempt to seduce Julie, a substitute teacher, but she will be at the opposite attracted to G√©rard. Even if he lives with his parents, he forms a distant couple with Marit√©, but she will decide to leave him and move to another region to distance herself. After an incident with a student, he will simulate a broken leg and arm for not being able to go back to school anymore for the end of the school year. *Michel, an art teacher, attempts to open his students to the art in the wide sense, whatever it is via an exposition of a language for babies symbolizing the waste, or to motivate them for redecorating the classes of the teachers. His conjugal relationship is tumultuous, his partner reproaching him to accord too much importance to his artistic practice and to refuse having a child together. He will end depressive when one of his students will have more success than him during an exposition. *G√©rard, a sport teacher, initiates his students to hula hoop, water skiing (where the students run fast to simulate the boat), windsurfing (during a windy day), golf, boomerang, etc. The activities often end with an accident. His relationship with Julie obliges him to numerous efforts, especially the cultural trips or reading novels, as well as the conception of a physical and more cerebral love. He will end depressive after the leaving of Julie. *Francis, a librarian, adept of the least effort for the classification in the library. Finding himself alone while his three other acolytes will be out of the school, he will be stated sick at his turn. The four acolytes will use of several stratagems to get rid of some teachers they judge harmful. *Charles Max, a philosophy teacher admirer of Karl Marx. They will stun him and relook him during his sleep to give him an appearance of Hitler with a tuft of hair and a small moustache. *Flora Taulier, a physics and chemistry teacher with authoritarian methods and who often uses torture with her students. They will mix some of her chemical products, which will cause an explosion in the class during a chemical experience. *Ren√© Nogret, a math teacher. They will add alcohol in the coffee machine at the point of making him drunk and ridiculous in public and at the sight of the director. They will also use of a stratagem to stick Josiane, the librarian and Bonnet, the censor, making them pass for lovers at the sight of the director and numerous witnesses. Finally, Caroline Derieux, a biology teacher and in love with Fr√©d√©ric, will have a suicide attempt during one of her classes when she will understand that he does not share her feelings. Fr√©d√©ric is globally appreciated by his students, at the point that Guillaume, a student, becomes jealous of him, thinking that he covets L√¶titia, a student of his class with whom he is himself in love with.

Some are familiar psychoactive plants in Western herbal medicine (e.g., ), but several Chinese plants have not been noted as hallucinogens in modern works (e.g.,). Chinese herbals are an important resource for the history of botany, for instance, Zhang Hua's c. 290 Bowuzhi is the earliest record of the psilocybin mushroom xi√†oj√πn (lit. \\"laughing mushroom\\", \\"Gymnopilus junonius, laughing gym\\"). Terminology There is a lexical gap between Chinese names and descriptions of hallucinogenic plants and English pharmacological terminology for hallucinogens, which are commonly divided into psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. The English lexicon has a complex semantic field for psychoactive drugs, and most terms are neologisms (n.b., the following definitions are from Stedman's Medical Dictionary 2008). Hallucination (from Latin alucinor \\"to wander in mind\\") is defined as: \\"The apparent, often strong subjective perception of an external object or event when no such stimulus or situation is present; may be visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile.\\" Hallucinogen (coined in 1952 from Latin alucinor and -gen \\"producing\\"): \\"A mind-altering chemical, drug, or agent, specifically a chemical the most prominent pharmacologic action of which is on the central nervous system (mescaline); in normal people, it elicits optic or auditory hallucinations, depersonalization, perceptual disturbances, and disturbances of thought processes.\\" Pharmacology divides hallucinogens into three classes. Psychedelic (first used in 1956 from Greek psyche- \\"mind; soul\\" and delein \\"to manifest\\"): \\"Pertaining to a rather imprecise category of drugs with mainly central nervous system action, and with effects said to be the expansion or heightening of consciousness, LSD, hashish, mescaline, psilocybin.\\" Dissociative is a class of hallucinogen that produces feelings of dissociation (Latin dissocioatus \\"to disjoin, separate\\" from socius \\"partner, ally\\") meaning \\"(3) An unconscious separation of a group of mental processes from the rest, resulting in an independent functioning of these processes and a loss of the usual associations, a separation of affect from cognition.\\" Dissociative disorders is defined as \\"a group of mental disorders characterized by disturbances in the functions of identity, memory, consciousness, or perception of the environment; this diagnostic group includes dissociative (older term, psychogenic) amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity (older term, multiple personality) disorder, and depersonalization disorder.\\" Deliriant is a technical term introduced to distinguish hallucinogens that primarily cause delirium (1982, from Latin deliro \\"to be crazy\\" and delira \\"go out of the furrow\\"): \\"An altered state of consciousness, consisting of confusion, distractibility, disorientation, disordered thinking and memory, defective perception (illusions and hallucinations), prominent hyperactivity, agitation, and autonomic nervous system overactivity; caused by illness, medication, or toxic, structural, and metabolic disorders.\\" The equivalent semantic field in the Chinese lexicon comprises contemporary loanwords (n.b., translation equivalents are primarily from Wenlin v. 4.3, 2016). Hu√†nju√© ( \\"hallucination; delusion; illusion\\") compounds hu√†n ( \\"unreal; imaginary; illusory\\") and (ju√©' \\"feeling; sensation; perception\\"). Zh√¨hu√†nj√¨ ( \\"psychedelic; hallucinogen\\") compounds zh√¨ ( \\"incur; cause\\"), hu√†n \\"unreal; imaginary; illusory\\", and j√¨ ( \\"medicinal preparation; dose\\"). Zh√¨hu√†ny√†o ( \\"hallucinogenic drug\\") with y√†o ( \\"medicine; drug\\") is a less common synonym. M√≠hu√†ny√†ow√π ( \\"psychedelic\\") combines m√≠hu√†n ( \\"phantasmagoric; surreal; mysterious; psychedelic\\") and y√†ow√π ( \\"medicine; pharmaceutical; medicament\\"). The Chinese technical names for the last two classes of hallucinogens are rare: Y√≥ul√≠y√†op«ên ( \\"dissociative\\") compounds y√≥ul√≠ ( \\"dissociated; drifting\\") and y√†op«ên ( \\" medicine; chemical reagent; drug\\"); and Zh√¨zhƒÅnw√†ngy√†o ( \\"deliriant\\") combines zh√¨ \\"incur; cause\\", zhƒÅnw√†ng ( \\"(medical) delirium\\"), and y√†o \\"medicine; drug\\". History Chinese pharmaceutical literature mainly comprises texts called bencao (), translatable as English herbal, pharmacopoeia, or materia medica. This word compounds ben \\"(plant) root/stem; basis, origin; foundation; book\\" and cao \\"grass; herb; straw\\". Although bencao is sometimes misinterpreted as \\"roots and herbs\\", the approximate meaning is \\"[pharmaceutics whose] basis [ben] [is] herbs [cao]\\" (Unschuld 1986: 14). These works deal with drugs of all origins, mainly vegetable but also mineral, animal, and even the human body. The Chinese botanist, academic, and researcher Hui-lin Li (1911-2002) wrote seminal articles about the history and use of hallucinogenic plants in China. Li cites a story in Li Shizhen's 1596 magnum opus Bencao gangmu as the first discussion about the general use of psychoactive plants. In 1561, after horrific murders in Changli, the Ming dynasty Jiajing Emperor proclaimed a nationwide edict warning about the dangers of hallucinogens. > Lang-tang (Hyoscyamus niger), Y√ºn-shih (Caesalpinia Sepiaria), Fang-k'uei > (Peucedanum japonica) and Red Shanglu (Phytolacca acinosa) all can cause > hallucination in peoples. In the past, this significance has not been fully > divulged. Plants of this kind are all toxic, which can obscure the mind, > alter one's consciousness, and confuse one's perception of sight and sound. > In the T'ang times, An Lu-shan [a foreign warlord in the Chinese army > service] once enticed the Kitan [tribesmen surrendered to his command] to > drink Lang-tang wine and buried them alive while they were unconscious. > Again in the second month of the 43rd year of the Chia-ch'in period (1561 > A.D.), a wandering monk, Wu Ju-hsiang of Shensi province, who possessed > wizardry, arrived at Ch'ang-li and stopped over at the house of a resident, > Chang Shu. Upon finding the latter's wife being very beautiful, he asked > that the entire family sit together at the table with him when he was being > offered a meal. He put some reddish potion in the rice and after a while the > whole family became unconscious and submitted to his assault. He then blew a > magic spell into the ears of Chang Shu and the latter turned crazy and > violent. Chang visualized his entire family as all devils and thereby killed > them all, sixteen altogether, without any blood shed. The local authorities > captured Chang Shu and kept him in prison. After ten days, he spat out > nearly two spittoonsful of phlegm, became conscious, and found out himself > that those he killed were his parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, his wife, > sons, sisters, nephews. Both Chang and Wu were committed to the death > sentence. The Emperor, Shih-tsung, proclaimed throughout the country about > the case. The particular magic potion must be of the kind of Lang-tang or > similar drugs. When the man was under the spell, he saw everyone else as a > devil. It is thus very important to find out the remedy that counteracts > such a thing. (tr. Li 1977: 162) Notable plants The following eight examples of confirmed and possible hallucinogens recorded in Chinese herbals are primarily based on the ten in Li Hui-Lin's 1977 article. Two edible plants, with only one Chinese source and no Western ones mentioning psychoactive properties, are omitted as unlikely: fangfeng ( \\"Saposhnikovia divaricata; Chinese parsnip\\") and longli ( \\"Nephelium topengii\\"; a type of lychee\\") (1977: 173-174). Hyoscyamus niger fruit and seeds Caesalpinia decapetala flowers Peucedanum japonicum Phytolacca acinosa flowers Cannabis sativa flowers Langdang: Hyoscyamus niger The l√†ngd√†ng ( \\"Hyoscyamus niger; black henbane\\") is one of the most famous hallucinogenic drugs in Chinese herbals. The seeds, which contain psychoactive tropane alkaloids, are called l√†ngd√†ngzi (, with -zi \\"child; seed\\") or tiƒÅnxiƒÅnzi ( \\"heavenly transcendent seeds\\"). For use in medicine, the seeds are supposedly treated by soaking in vinegar and milk to reduce their toxicity. The Shennong Bencaojing says, \\"[The seeds] when taken [when properly prepared] for a prolonged period enable one to walk for long distances, benefiting to the mind and adding to the strength ... and to communicate with spirits and seeing devils. When taken in excess, it causes one to stagger madly.\\" (tr. Li 1977: 166). Lei Xiao's 470 Leigong paozhilun ( \\"Master Lei's Treatise on the Decoction and Preparation of Drugs\\") states that the seed \\"is extremely poisonous, and when accidentally taken, it causes delirium and seeing sparks and flashes\\", and Zhen Chuan's c. 620 Bencao yaoxing ( \\"Nature of Drugs in Materia Medica\\") says the seeds \\"should not be taken raw as it hurts people, causing them to see devils, acting madly like picking needles\\" (tr. Li 1977: 167). Yunshi: Caesalpinia decapetala The yunshi ( \\"Caesalpinia decapetala; cat's claw\\") was a versatile drug plant in the Chinese pharmacopeia, and the root, flowers, and seeds were all used in medicine. The Shennong Bencao says, \\"[The flowers] could enable one to see spirits, and when taken in excess, cause one to stagger madly. If taken over a prolonged period, they produce somatic levitation and effect communication with spirits.\\" Tao Hongjing, who edited the official Shangqing Daoist canon, also compiled the c. 510 Mingyi bielu ( \\"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\\") that says \\"[The flowers] will drive away evil spirits. When put in water and burned, spirits can be summoned\\" and \\"The seeds are like langdang (Hyoscyamus niger), if burned, spirits can be summoned; but this [sorcery] method has not been observed.\\" (tr. Li 1977: 167). Li Hui-Lin notes this plant \\"has not been noted as a hallucinogenic plant in modern works. In fact, as far as I am aware, it has not been investigated medicinally or chemically\\" (1977: 168). Fangkui: Peucedanum japonicum The fangkui ( \\"Peucedanum japonicum\\") root is used in Chinese medicine, and, like the previous cat's claw, has not been noted as a hallucinogenic in modern works. The c. 510 Tao Hongjing mingyi bielu states, \\"Feverish people should not take it, because it causes one to be delirious and see spirits\\"; and Chen Yanzhi's () c. 454-473 Xiaoping fang ( \\"Minor Prescriptions\\") says that fangkui, \\"if taken in excess, makes one become delirious and act somewhat like mad\\" (tr. Li 1977: 168). P. japonicum is also used quite extensively in Korean cuisine - not only as a culinary herb, but also as a leaf vegetable, raising the question as to what constitutes consumption 'to excess'. It may be the case that the strain of plant grown in Korea is less toxic / medicinal than that found in China, or that very substantial quantities of the plant must be eaten before any psychoactive effects are manifested. Alternatively, the psychoactive components of the plant may be deactivated by the cooking processes employed in the preparation of the plant in Korea. Shanglu: Phytolacca acinosa The shanglu ( \\"Phytolacca acinosa; India pokeweed\\") has edible leaves and poisonous roots. China's oldest extant dictionary, the c. 3rd-century BCE Erya (13: 110) gives two names for pokeweed: ch√πtƒÅng () and m«éwƒõi ( \\"horsetail\\"). Chinese herbals distinguish two kinds of shanglu, white with white flowers and white root, and red with red flowers and purple root. The white root is edible when cooked but the red root is extremely poisonous. The Tao Hongjing mingyi bielu records how Daoists used the red variety, \\"By boiling or brewing and then taken, it can be used for abdominal parasitic worms and for seeing spirits\\"; Su Song's 1061 Bencao tujing ( \\"Illustrated Pharmacopeia\\") says, \\"It was much used by sorcerers in ancient times\\" (tr. Li 1977: 169). Su Gong's 659 Tang bencao (ÂîêÊú¨Ëçâ \\"Tang dynasty pharmacopeia\\") says \\"The red kind can be used to summon spirits; it is very poisonous. It can be only used as external application for inflammation. When ingested, it is extremely harmful, causing unceasing bloody stool. It may be fatal. It causes one to see spirits.\\" (tr. Li 1977: 170). The 1406 Jiuhuang Bencao \\"Famine Relief Herbal\\" lists pokeweed as a famine food. It gives instructions for removing the poisonous phytolaccatoxin from the white roots and mentions Daoist xian using the flowers: \\"Cut them up into slices, scald, then soak and wash repeatedly (throwing away the extract) until the material is clean; then just eat it with garlic. ‚Ä¶ Plants with white flowers can (it is said) confer longevity; the immortals collected them to make savouries to take with their wine.\\" (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 340-341). Dama: Cannabis sativa Dama ( \\"Cannabis sativa; hemp; marijuana\\") has been grown in China since Neolithic times. At a very early period the Chinese recognized the Cannabis plant as dioecious, the male plants produce better fibers and the female plants produce more cannabinoids. In modern usage, the names are x«ê ( \\"male cannabis\\") and j≈´ ( \\"female cannabis\\") (Li 1973: 294). Reflecting the importance of cannabis in ancient China, the ca. 3rd century BCE Erya dictionary (13) has four definitions: f√©n () and x«êsh√≠ () mean \\"cannabis flower\\"; x«ê () and m√° () mean \\"cannabis\\" generally and not \\"male cannabis\\"; f√∫ (, lit. \\"reed membrane\\") and m√°m«î (, \\"cannabis mother\\") mean \\"female cannabis\\"; and b√≤ () and shƒÅnm√° ( \\"mountain cannabis\\") mean \\"wild cannabis\\", possibly C. ruderalis. The Shennong bencao calls \\"cannabis flowers/buds\\" mafen () or mabo () and says: \\"To take much makes people see demons and throw themselves about like maniacs []. But if one takes it over a long period of time one can communicate with the spirits, and one's body becomes light []\\" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 150). The Mingyi bielu records that in the 6th century, mabo were, \\"very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians [shujia ] say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\\" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 151, see cannabis and time perception). Meng Shen's c. 670 Shiliao bencao ( \\"Nutritional Therapy Pharmacopeia\\") says people will combine equal parts of raw cannabis flowers, Japanese sweet flag, and wild mandrake, \\"pound them into pills of the size of marbles and take one facing the sun every day. After one hundred days, one can see spirits.\\" (tr. Li 1977: 171). Tang Shengwei's 1108 Zhenglei bencao ( \\"Reorganized Pharmacopeia\\") gives a more complete account on the pharmaceutical uses of cannabis: \\"Ma-fen has a spicy taste; it is toxic; it is used for waste diseases and injuries; it clears blood and cools temperature; it relieves fluxes; it undoes rheumatism; it discharges pus. If taken in excess, it produces hallucinations and a staggering gait. If taken over a long term, it causes one to communicate with spirits and lightens one's body.\\" (tr. Li 1977: 170). According to the sinologists and historians Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei- djen, some early Daoists adapted censers for the religious and spiritual use of cannabis. The c. 570 Daoist encyclopedia Wushang Biyao ( \\"Supreme Secret Essentials\\") recorded adding cannabis into ritual censers, and they suggest Yang Xi (330-c. 386), who wrote the Shangqing scriptures during alleged visitations by Daoist xian, was \\"aided almost certainly by cannabis\\" (1974: 150-151). Mantuolou: Datura stramonium Datura stramonium fruit and seeds The mantuoluo ( \\"Datura stramonium; jimsonweed\\" or \\"(Buddhism) mandala\\") contains highly toxic Tropane alkaloids. Several Datura species were introduced into China from India, and Li Shizhen's 1596 Bencao gangmu was the first herbal to record the medicinal use of flowers and seeds. The drug is used in combination with Cannabis sativa and taken with wine as an anesthetic for small operations and cauterizations. Li Shizhen personally experimented with jimsonweed and recorded his experience as follows: \\"According to traditions, it is alleged that when the flowers are picked for use with wine while one is laughing, the wine will cause one to produce laughing movements; and when the flowers are picked while one is dancing, the wine will cause one to produce dancing movements. [I have found out] that such movements will be produced when one becomes half-drunk with the wine and someone else laughs or dances to induce these actions.\\" (tr. Li 1977: 172). Maogen: Ranunculus japonicus Ranunculus japonicus The maogen ( \\"Ranunculus japonicus; buttercup\\") is a poisonous plant with bright yellow flowers. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong's c. 340 Zhouhou jiuzu fang ( \\"Remedies for Emergencies\\", tr. Li 1977: 172) says, \\"Among the herbs there is the Shui Lang (water Lang, a kind of Mao-ken) a plant with rounded leaves which grows along water courses and is eaten by crabs. It is poisonous to man and when eaten by mistake, it produces a maniacal delirium, appearing like a stroke and sometimes with blood-spitting. The remedy is to use licorice.\\" Later herbals, which do not mention maogen as a deliriant, say the whole plant is considered poisonous and is should only be externally used as a medicine for irritation and inflammation. Xiaojun: Gymnopilus junonius(?) Gymnopilus junonius Panaeolus papilionaceus The xiaojun ( \\"laughing mushroom\\") was known to Chinese herbalists for centuries before modern botanists identified it as a type of psilocybin mushroom, most likely either Gymnopilus junonius or Laughing Gym or Panaeolus papilionaceus or Petticoat Mottlegill. The earliest record of a mushroom that causes uncontrollable laughter appears in Zhang Hua's c. 290 Bowuzhi compendium of natural wonders, in a context describing two unusual kinds of j√πn ( \\"mushroom; fungus\\") that grow on tree bark. > In all the mountain commanderies to the South of the Yangzi, there is a > fungus which grows [] throughout the spring and summer on the large trees > that have fallen down; it is known as the Zhen [ \\"chopping block (for > execution)\\"]. If one eats it, it is tasty, but suddenly the poison takes > effect and kills the eater. ‚Ä¶ If one eats Sweet gum tree growths [], they > will induce uncontrollable laughter. If one drinks \\"earth sauce\\" [t«îjiƒÅng ] > one will recover. (tr. Greatrex 1987: 139) The Bencao gangmu records Tao Hongjing's recipe for preparing \\"earth sauce\\": \\"Dig out a pit three chi deep in a place where there is yellow earth. Take freshly-drawn water and pour it into the pit, stirring the water so as to make it turbid. After a short while, draw off the clear water and use this. It is called either 'soil sauce' or 'earth sauce'.\\" (tr. Greatrex 1987: 264). Hui- lin Li quotes a Chinese-language study of \\"laughing mushrooms\\" that this \\"soil infusion\\" is the clear liquid after soil is mixed with water and allowed to settle, and an effective antidote for poisons (1977: 175). Subsequent Chinese authors give many similar records. Chen Renyu's () I245 J√πnp«î ( \\"Mushroom Guidebook\\") says this fungus is named t«îx√πn ( \\"earth mushroom\\") or d√πx√πn ( \\"pear mushroom\\") and \\"grows in the ground. People believe it to be formed by the air from poisonous vermin, and kills people if taken.... Those poisoned by it will laugh. As an antidote, use strong tea, mixed with alum and fresh clear water. Upon swallowing this, it will cure immediately.\\" (Li 1977: 175). The c. 304 Nanfang Caomu Zhuang mentions sweetgum tree growths in a quite different context, the shamans in the southern state of Yue use a magical fƒìngr√©n ( \\"sweetgum person\\") that is a kind of li√∫y«êng ( \\"gall\\") found growing on sweetgum trees. \\"When aged they develop tumors. Sometimes in a violent thunder storm, the tree tumors grow suddenly three to five feet in one night, and these are called Feng-jen. The witches of Yueh collect these for witchcraft, saying that they have proof of their supernatural quality.\\" (tr. Li 1979: 77). Later sources gave two explanations of the sweetgum tree growths, either as galls that resemble humans and have magical powers or as parasitic plants with rain-giving powers (1979: 78-79). In Japan, both medieval and modern sources record laughing mushrooms. An 11th-century story in the Konjaku Monogatarish≈´ describes a group of Buddhist nuns who ate maitake ( \\"dancing mushrooms\\") and began to laugh and dance uncontrollably. It is also known as the waraitake ( \\"laughing mushroom\\"), which scholars have identified as the Panaeolus papilionaceus or Petticoat Mottlegill; the related Panaeolus cinctulus or Banded Mottlegill; and the psilocybin mushroom Gymnopilus junonius or Laughing Cap also called ≈çwaraitake ( \\"Big Laughing Mushroom\\") (Sanford 1972). In a study on early Daoist practitioners searching for the elixir of Immortality, Needham and Lu mention the possible use of hallucinogenic plants, such as Amanita muscaria \\"fly agaric\\" and xiaojun \\"laughing mushrooms\\". Based on Tang dynasty and Song dynasty references, they tentatively identify it as a Panaeolus or Pholiota and suggest that the properties of at least some psychoactive mushrooms were widely known. They predict the further exploration of hallucinogenic fungi and other plants in Daoism and in Chinese culture in general \\"will be an exciting task\\" (1974: 121).

The 2016 New York Drought was by some measures the worst drought to affect Western New York and parts of the Finger Lakes Region and Southern Tier on record. By the middle of July, the percent of the state by area that was in a D-2 (Severe Drought) according to the United States Drought Monitor was 23.01%, the greatest amount since the weekly reports began in 2000. Nearly 90% of the state was classified as \\"Abnormally Dry\\" or \\"Moderate Drought\\". For reference, none of the state has ever been placed in D-4 (Exceptional Drought). Furthermore, The Buffalo News reported on July 22 that it had become the worst drought in the Buffalo area since their main weather station opened in 1943. There was a longer term dry period through the 1960s in New York with greater duration but less intensity. By July the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) had placed the entire state in a \\"drought watch\\". While the drought is not nearly as severe as other droughts that take place in the west and midwestern United States in terms of duration and crop loss, droughts of this magnitude are rare in the temperate climate of Upstate New York. The drought began with a winter that in many areas in the northeast set a record warm December through February, leading to a weak spring meltoff. Early summer Although May saw decent rainfall, the preceding and following months saw great deficits. Streams and ponds dried or saw near record low flow rates, and the water table lowered significantly in some areas. Many large rivers, including the Genesee River, were running at about 20% of normal, many below the fifth percentile. Historical remains were briefly visible in the Genesee riverbed including a defunct fountain and a cofferdam where trains ran during early 20th century riverbed deepening to reduce flooding, as well as historic building foundations. Some crops began to fail by July, including crops that did not germinate in the dry soil, and production and nutrition was low in crops that did mature. Perennial crops including fruit trees, Christmas trees, and strawberries were also affected, with deeper root crops such as corn about half the normal height by early August. Significant shortfalls in pasture and hay production compounded very low milk prices to put an existential strain on local dairy farms. Due to extensive watering, the 2016 Garden Walk Buffalo was not significantly impacted. In mid July, the state issued a drought watch for the first time since 2002. Summer By late July, the area under the severe drought widened slightly to 26.82% despite widespread rains that exceeded an inch in parts of Western New York. The Taughannock Falls slowed to such a minimal flow that hiking the nearly empty riverbed of Taughannock Creek was permitted in Taughannock Falls State Park. On July 27, The Ithaca Journal reported that the Ithaca water supply reservoir was critically low, within a month of running dry, as areas creeks reached record lows. With many locations receiving less than half and as low as a third the normal amount of spring-summer rain, local wells ran dry. Anecdotally, rainfall was less than a quarter of normal with the drought being the worst in at least a half century. On August 3 the DEC, under direction of governor Andrew Cuomo, moved the entire Western portion of the state to drought warning, while the rest of the state remained under a drought watch. Statistically, it was the fifth driest spring-summer (March‚ÄìJuly) period in Buffalo (9.07 inches) since record keeping began in 1871, with 1941 (9 inches), 1915 (8.92 inches), 1898 (8.34 inches), and 1934 (7.75 inches) eclipsing it. However, this does not account for the mild winter or the above average temperatures and low humidity of the 2016 summer. Additionally, the rain was intermittent in larger amounts versus multi-day periods of slower, soaking rain. Late summer September 6 Drought Monitor report showing virtually the entire Finger Lakes region in a D-3 Extreme Drought state. September 27 Drought Monitor report showing identical D-4 patch. On August 8, a tropical system featuring high humidity and moisture was forecast to bring several inches of rain to Upstate New York over several days from Wednesday through the weekend, including enough moisture to produce up to two inches on the first day. The August 11 drought monitor report (valid up to Tuesday August 9) showed the area of severe drought increasing to 29.5%, covering nearly all of the state from Syracuse west and again setting a weekly report record, though it did not account for widespread rainfall of one half to two inches that took place on Wednesday August 10. Nonetheless, the drought continued as many locations were at a nearly 10 inch deficit for the year. The August 16 drought monitor report showed that while the severe drought area declined slightly, six percent of the state was upgraded to D3 (Extreme Drought), a first for the state during the summer (about 3% of state around New York City saw D3 drought in spring 2002) The area was a long narrow strip from Lake Erie to the northern half of Seneca County, roughly along the I-90 corridor, as well as a spot in the southern Finger Lakes. The Extreme Drought area remained the same for the next two weeks, other than the removal of the western fringe in Erie County. The September 6 report saw the D3 Extreme Drought area double to nearly 10% of the state, with the main area and spot to the southeast being connected. Also during this time (August 29), the United States Department of Agriculture designated 15 New York counties as drought disaster areas, qualifying some local farmers for low interest loans. The counties are Cayuga, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins, Wyoming and Yates. Some surrounding counties were also eligible for the loans, available for eight months after August 29. In all about 18,000 farms covering 3.7 million acres are eligible for the funding when four related drought counties in Pennsylvania are included. New York State and agricultural representatives toured drought-stricken areas in early September. They included Senator Tom O'Mara, Senator Patty Ritchie New York State Department of Agriculture Commissioner Richard Ball. In combination with also being one of the warmest summers in the area, including a sunny June and July and the hottest August on record for Rochester, the drought was worse than rainfall data would suggest, making it possibly the worst drought on modern record when the two factors were considered together. Fall The drought continued through the middle of October, with about 5% of the state in the Finger Lakes still under D-3 Extreme Drought as of October 18. However, a several day pattern of rainy weather later that week dropped up to of rain in some areas, and several inches over much of the affected central New York area. The record rainfall effectively quelled the severe drought at least at surface level; however, the vast majority of the state remained \\"abnormally dry\\" or \\"moderate drought\\", with the Finger Lakes region and Western New York, as well as downstate, still in a substantial drought. The drought at this point was expected to last through January. After the first week of November, about 80% of the state was considered to be in a moderate drought, and about 23% in a D-2 Severe Drought, mainly in the southeastern Finger Lakes and downstate and central Long Island areas. By the mid November report, parts of the Hudson Valley were back into D-3 Extreme Drought category, as part of an ongoing drought in the tri-state (New York-New Jersey-Connecticut) New York metropolitan area that was also expected to last through winter. Winter April 4 2017 Early winter in western New York saw several snowstorms as well as several inches of rain, though according to the drought monitor, much of the region where the drought was worst was still classified as abnormally dry or even moderate drought, though topsoil conditions were soggy. The Cheektowaga office of the National Weather Service reported an above average 6.17 inches of rain from December first to mid January, but snowfall was about ten inches short at 33 inches for the same period. The winter went on to be one of the warmest on record, with below average snowfall, but plenty of rainfall, effectively ending the drought in western New York. The drought was officially announced to be over in March 2017. The next spring went on to be one of the wettest on record in the northeast, causing Lake Ontario to hit record high levels. Conclusion Results from a survey of over 200 farmers released in 2017 showed that over two thirds of un-irrigated fields had losses between 30 and 90 percent. Even irrigated crops had losses up to a third. Longer frost-free growing seasons and warmer temperatures create the need for increased rainfall to balance water loss. For legal and disaster loan purposes, the drought officially began on July 12, 2016 and included the counties of Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chenango, Cortland, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Madison, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Orleans, Oswego, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins and Wyoming. The drought was the most intense short duration drought since an 18-month drought in the early 30s.

The deteriorating environment is caused by the radical irrigation policies of the former Soviet Union in the 1960s ‚Äì between Soviet, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and southwestern Kazakhstan. A dreamy, surrealistic mixture of documentary and fantasy, Transoxiana Dreams explores the desertification through the eyes of a fisherman's daughter as the main protagonist. The girl's father encounters strange mythical female creatures during his journey as he ventures for new fishing grounds ‚Äì scarce leftover of what once was Aral Sea. The mythical creatures ‚Äì derived from Greek's mythological figure, the Centaur, was chosen as according to legend, upon their initial meeting, the ancient Greeks mistook the nomads of Transoxianian Steppes on their horses as mythological. Transoxiana Dreams won the main award at Kino der Kunst 2013 - an international film festival hosted in Munich, Germany. = Milk for Lambs (2010) = The visual of this 11:35 minute video installation is composed of alternating black-and-white and color frames. Milk for Lambs straddles the line between contemporary Kazakhstan and its mythically infused historic ritual. Set against the vast landscape of the steppe, it traces what's left of Tengriism ‚Äì where the skygod Tengri is the main deity and his wife, Umai, the all-nurturing mother goddess of the Turkic Siberians. The film follows the former nomads as they celebrate the festivities held in honor of Tengri and Umai, and the accompanying rituals. Milk for Lambs won KfW Audience Award of the Videonale 13: Festival for Contemporary Art in Kunstmuseum, Bonn. = Kissing Totems (2008) = Kissing Totems is the first solo exhibition Almagul Menlibayeve held in the United States, and the title of the solo exhibition is one of her recent works in 2008 with the same name. In her film, ‚ÄúKissing Totems‚Äù, it is about a set of surrealist actions and impossible encounters happened on the territory of a deserted factory from the Soviet era. The industrial ruin of Communism has become a stage, a kind of bird, also a totem and peris which mark the transition of dream-narrative. By invoking confounding feelings and curiosity, the artist asks audiences to watch the film through the eyes of a little girl, the audiences observe the unbelievable thing by contemplative detachment. When the little girl walks through the past symbol of Communism, from camera to industrial materialism of industry. At the same time, the little girl feels comfy with two symbol systems. Through her imagine gaze, the post-communism becomes another totemic myth that being occupied by ideologies and the newly revived beliefs. = On the Road (2007) = One the Road is one of Almagul Menlibayeve's artworks blends in poetry into video and performance that being presented in a unique setting as brings topic of Islamic cultural tradition and contemporary art together. The following is her own artist statement towards On the Road: ‚ÄúMy educational background is in the Soviet Russian avant-garde school of Futurism, which I combine with a nomadic aesthetic of post-Soviet, contemporary Kazakhstan ‚Äì something that I have been exploring in recent years through my photographic and video work. I use specific ways of expression in modern and contemporary art as a vehicle to investigate my personal archaic atavism as a certain mystical anthropomorphism. In other words, I explore the nature of a specific Egregore, a shared cultural psychic experience, which manifests itself as a specific thought-form among the people(s) of the ancient, arid and dusty Steppes between the Caspian Sea, Baikonur and Altai in today‚Äôs Kazakhstan. In the Russian language, Archaic Atavism is personalized as a being, which points to and creates a different meaning. We are not just speaking about an idea or archaic element in the collective subconscious of a people, but about the embodiment of our archaic atavism that becomes an active entity, just like a creature itself. Our archaic atavism is not just internalized, but also externalized. It is as if he has been awakened by the post-Soviet experience of the indigenous Kazakh people, who are becoming their own after 80 years of Soviet domination and cultural genocide. Suddenly he (Archaic Atavism) became interested in enculturation and in behavioral modernity. He also began to have entertaining dialogues with the transnational circulation of ideas in contemporary art. For this dialogue, I have chosen the medium of video and photography and like to work with the notion of memory and reality. My archaic atavism is interested in my video explorations in the Steppes and in post-Soviet Asia. By editing raw data and combining documentary and staged footage, I become his voice, enabling a cultural e—Ö–ædus from long oblivion. My work raises metaphysical questions such as who am I? And where shall I go? This (psychic) experience and perspective marks my artistic language.‚Äù (Almagul Menlibayeva) √∑  Awards and grants  * 2017 She received from Ministry of Culture of France Chevalier Ordre des Arts et des Lettres https://kz.ambafrance.org/Ceremonie-de-remise- des-insignes-de-chevalier-dans-l-ordre-Arts-et-lettres-a-l * 2013 Main Award, KINO DER KUNST International Film Festival, Munich; * 2011 KfW Audience Award, VIDEONALE 13: Festival for Contemporary Art, Kunstmuseum Bonn, Bonn Art * 2011 Culture Network Program Grant, OpenSociety Institute, Budapest; * 2010 Prize de la Nuit Award, 8th International Festival Signes de Nuit, Paris; * 2009 First Prize, Zolotoy Buben [Golden Tambourine], 13th International Festival of Television Programs and Films, Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia * 2004 Third prize, Videoidentity:Sacred Places of Kazakhstan, Video Festival, Soros Center for Contemporary Art, Almaty *2003 Tarlan, Prize for Young Artist, commissioned by Independent Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan; * 2002 Second prize, 1st Video Festival, the Soros Center for Contemporary Art, Almaty Tarlan Annual National Independent Prize of the Philanthropists‚Äô Club of Kazakhstan, Almaty; * 1996 Daryn, State Youth Prize, Kazakhstan; * 1995 Grand Prix, Asia Art, 2nd Central Asian Biennale, Tashkent, Uzbekistan;  References  Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:People from Almaty Category:Kazakhstani artists Category:Kazakhstani women artists Category:Kazakhstani women by occupation ","title":"Almagul Menlibayeva"},{"id":"52118294","text":"The 1976 United States presidential election in Arizona was part of the 1976 United States presidential election, which took place on November 2, 1976, throughout all fifty states and D.C.
