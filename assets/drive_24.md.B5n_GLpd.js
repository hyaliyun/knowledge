Origins The Apostolic Vicariate of Bangueolo has its origins in the White Fathers mission at Mambwe Mwela, to the east of Mbala, established in 1891. The missionaries moved to Kayambi in 1895. In 1897 the Apostolic Vicariate of Nyassa was separated from the Apostolic Vicariate of Tanganyika, covering what is now Malawi and the north and east of Zambia. Bishop Joseph Dupont was the first Vicar Apostolic of Nyassa. On 28 January 1913 the Apostolic Vicariate of Bangueolo was separated from Nyassa. History The new vicariate of Bangweulu covered the Northern and Luapula Regions, while the south east part kept the name Nyassa. On 28 January 1913 Bishop Etienne-Benoît Larue was consecrated as the first Vicar Apostolic. In 1913 the Bangweulu vicariate had six mission stations, twenty five priests, eight White Sisters and six lay brothers. There were 246 catechists and 5,800 baptized Christians. The vicariate bordered German East Africa. It became a war zone when World War II (1914-1918) started. The population suffered from food requisitions, taxes and forced levies of men to act as porters and to do other war-related work. Missionaries were called up to work in the hospitals or as chaplains with the troops. On 23 May 1933 the northeast was separated as the Mission Sui Juris of Lwangwa, administered by Fr. Jan Cornelius van Sambeek. On 5 October 1935 Bishop Larue died and was succeeded by Bishop Alexandre-Auguste-Laurent-Marie Roy. On 10 March 1949 Mgr. Alexander Roy resigned as Vicar Apostolic and was succeeded by Marcel Daubechies. On 10 July 1952 the western part of the vicariate became Apostolic Prefecture of Fort Rosebery (Mansa), while the eastern part became the Apostolic Vicariate of Kasama. Marcel Daubechies remained as Vicar Apostolic of Kasama.

He has been involved in 33 feature film productions since his debut in Fred Young's Dibalik Awan in 1963. Biography Pelamonia was born in Ambon, Maluku, on 16 March 1940. His parents intended for him to become a priest, and after senior high school he sent to Java to prepare for it. In 1962, however, Pelamonia enrolled at the Indonesian National Theater Academy (, or ATNI). He had his first film role, a bit part in Fred Young's Dibalik Awan (Behind the Clouds), the following year. During his school years he acted in two films, D. Djajakusuma's Masa Topan dan Badai (Time of Storms and Gales; 1963) and Pitrajaya Burnama's Karma (1965). He was also involved in television, becoming a presenter for the newly established TVRI. In 1965 Pelamonia dropped out of ATNI and signed with Pertisa Film, later known as Tuti Mutia Film Production. Pelamonia's first film for the company, Fadjar Ditengah Kabut (Dawn Amidst the Fog), saw him act and serve as assistant director to Danu Umbara. The following year Pelamonia made his directorial debut with Sendja di Jakarta (Twilight in Jakarta), an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Mochtar Lubis. Two years later he departed for West Germany, where he studied filmmaking. Upon his return to Indonesia in 1970, Pelamonia resumed acting. He took a role in Hasmanan's Samiun dan Dasima (Samiun and Dasima) in 1970. The following year he directed his first film since returning from West Germany, Jang Djatuh Dikaki Lelaki (Those Who Fall at the Feet of Men) from the novel by Abdullah Harahap. He directed a further four films for Tuti Mutia, acting in several of them. This culminated with Semalam di Malaysia (One Night in Malaysia) in 1975. After the film garnered him a Citra Award for Best Director at the 1976 Indonesian Film Festival, Pelamonia left Tuti Mutia and began working as a freelancer. Between 1976 and 1988 Pelamonia directed another 13 films, mostly romances. His 1981 adaptation of Marga T's Dr. Karmila garnered him another Citra Award nomination, although he lost to Arifin C. Noer of Serangan Fajar (Attack at Dawn).

She is best known for winning the Grand National Steeplechase in 1861. She also competed in the Grand National in 1859 and won the Doncaster Grand National Steeplechase that year. She was owned by Mr. Bayley and later J. Bennett and was trained by Charles Balchin. Background Jealousy (who was originally called Relapse) was a bay filly foaled in 1854. She was sired by The Cure, who won the Champagne Stakes in 1843. As a sire he also produced the July Stakes winner Dictator and Ebor Handicap winners El Hakim and Underhand. Jealousy's dam was Jewess, a daughter of Jacques. She was trained by Charles Balchin. Racing career 1858/59 season In November 1858 Jealousy won a Hurdle race at Shrewsbury by one length from Wee Willie. Later in the month she won the Wellington Open Steeplechase at Wellington Racecourse, easily beating Young Magnet (second) and five others. On 2 March 1859 Jealousy carried 9 st 8 lb in the four-mile Grand National Steeplechase at Liverpool. The Brewer started the race as the favorite, priced at about 100/30, with Half Caste next at 100/15 and Jealousy third in the betting at about 9/1. With Jealousy being ridden by Joseph Kendall, the field started on their second attempt and Jealousy was positioned near the fore, but dropped back after the first fence. As the field turned onto the main racecourse, Jealousy was already well behind the leaders. She finished the race tailed-off, walking past the finish. Half Caste won the race by a neck from Jean du Quesne. At the York Steeplechase meeting she finished second in the Londesborough Great Handicap, one length behind winner Chance. In early May Jealousy started as the favourite for a Handicap Hurdle race at Manchester, but bolted and ended up finishing last. Later in May she won the Grand National Steeplechase at Doncaster by ten lengths from Omar Pacha. 1859/60 season In November 1859, Jealousy finished second, a neck behind winner Magenta, in a Hurdle race at Shrewsbury. Later in the month she finished fifth behind winner Goldsmith (who won by 20 lengths) in the Grand Open Steeplechase at Warwick and Leamington. 1860/61 season On 21 November 1860 Jealousy started as the odds-on favourite for a Handicap Hurdle race at Leamington. She took the lead after the first flight of hurdles. As the field turned into the finishing straight Bannockburn (who had fallen at the third hurdle and been remounted) closed down Jealousy's lead, but she soon pulled away again to win by ten lengths. Bannockburn was pulled up, leaving Romeo to finish second. On 13 March 1861 she started as the 9/2 joint-favoruite, along with the 1860 Grand National winner Anatis, for the Grand National Steeplechase at Aintree. As in 1859 she was ridden by Joseph Kendall. She was reasonably close to the leaders in the early stages and took the lead from her stable companion Xanthus as the field entered the main racecourse. Xanthus retook the lead as they entered the racecourse for a second time, with Jealousy close behind in third. Jealousy was just leading over the final fence and staying in the lead to win by two lengths from The Dane, with Old Ben Roe a further two lengths behind in third place. Prior to the race some people had doubted whether she would stay the full race distance after her poor running in the 1859 National. 1861/62 season Jealousy given an entry for the 1862 Grand National, but was not declared to run. 1862/63 season Jealousy started the 1863 Grand National as the 3/1 favourite and was carrying 11 st 10 lb. Initially Medora took the lead, with Jealousy not being amongst the front runners. By the time the field had got over Becher's Brook, Medora was leading from Master Bagot and Jealousy had moved into fourth place. Jealousy then took the lead at Valentine's brook and by the time they were onto the regular racecourse she was clear of the field. As they jumped the fence opposite stands she was side-by-side with Medora. As the field approached Beecher's Brook for the second time, Yaller Gal took the lead, until she was challenged by Emblem, who in turn was followed by Arbury. Emblem pulled clear of the field and won by 20 lengths from Arbury. Jealousy finished the race in sixth place. 1863/64 season She was entered for the 1864 Grand National, but did not take part in the race. Stud career Through her daughter Madame Colorado, Jealously was the direct female-line ancestor of Shining Way, who won the Irish Oaks in 1912. Shining Way foaled the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Dark Lantern. Jealousy died in December 1868.

An alpha version of the game was made available on 19 August 2013. The final version was released on 2 May 2014. Gameplay The player hides from robots patrolling a town, watching them from afar using binoculars. In Sir, You Are Being Hunted, players have to survive from 'Hunters' (robots dressed as Victorian gentlemen) who are trying to track down and kill them, whilst attempting to escape from an island. Players are required to scavenge towns and villages for items such as food and weapons to help them survive whilst collecting parts of an exploded machine in order to escape the island. If the robots find a part, they set up sentries around it to defend it from the player. The game's enemies utilise dogs and balloons in order to find the player. The island played on is procedurally generated, meaning that every playthrough will generate a different landscape. It is populated with villages, towns and other areas where the player can find essential supplies. Robots As of \\"The February update\\", nine AI robot models are in-game; the upper-class Hunter, middle-class Squire, lower-class Poacher, along with the Dogs, Scarecrows, Bog Monster, Balloons, Riders, mechanical-horse riding fox-hunters, and the Landowner, a huge, aristocratic robot. Development After Sir, You Are Being Hunted had been in development for six months, a Kickstarter campaign was launched in November 2012 to crowd fund the game, with a £40,000 goal. Funding ended in December, with a total of £92,551 raised towards game development. This amount fell short of the £100,000 that would allow character creation and customization, but Big Robot stated that they would \\"endeavour to get some aspects of it into the game.\\" Big Robot founder Jim Rossignol said that the development team wanted to make a game that was \\"desperate and scary, but without being straight-faced,\\" and \\"kitschy but with a genuine underlying threat.\\" Jim stated that the team \\"had a vision to take what was kind of bleak and frightening about the British landscape and put it into a game\\", going on to say that they had focused heavily on audio in the game, describing it as \\"one of those differences that people won't really notice explicitly while they are playing but they will get a lot back from it.\\" In May 2013 new gameplay videos showcased mountain biomes which had recently been added. These biomes are remote mountainous and rocky areas away from lootable buildings. Marketing and release In April 2013, two gameplay videos were released, showing a developer playing an early version of the game. Kickstarter backers were allowed to play an alpha version of the game before the full release, with it being reported that around 900 players had early access. On 19 August 2013, the alpha version was made available for Kickstarter backers and purchase through Steam or the Humble Store. On 1 May 2014, chap hop artist Professor Elemental released the song \\"Being Hunted\\" as a cross-promotion with the game's release date on the following day. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

There are two important limitations: First, the high withstanding voltage required of the capacitor, along with the high-capacitance required for a given output current, mean that this type of supply is only practical for low-power applications. (The capacitance needed increases with the current to be drawn; high capacitance mains-voltage capacitors are expensive and bulky.) The second is that due to the absence of electrical isolation between input and output, anything connected to the power supply must be reliably insulated so that it is not possible for a person to come into electrical contact with it. Low cost PSUcapacitor instead of the transformerThe Shocking Truth About Transformerless Power Supplies By the equation of state for capacitance, where I_c = C \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}, the current is limited to: 1 amp, per farad, per volt-rms, per radian (of phase). Or 2\\\\pi amps, per farad, per volt- rms, per hertz. Structure  A capacitive power supply usually has a rectifier and filter to generate a direct current from the reduced alternating voltage. Such a supply comprises a capacitor, C1 whose reactance limits the current flowing through the rectifier bridge D1. A resistor, R1, connected in series with it protects against voltage spikes during switching operations. An electrolytic capacitor, C2, is used to smooth the DC voltage and the peak current (in the range of amps) in switching operations. Above right a voltage regulator can be seen, formed by the current limiting resistor, R3, and the zener shunt regulator, IC1. If the voltage stability is not too important a Zener diode can be used as a regulator; the two-terminal device would eliminate R4 and R5 used as a resistive voltage divider in the schematic above. Example  A lamp that has 48 LEDs - 3 W/230 V By changing the value of the example in the diagram by a capacitor with a value of 330 nF, we can provide a current of 20 mA. This way you can power up to 48 white LEDs (for example, 3.1 V/20 mA/20000 mcd) - that is provided connected in series. At 50 Hz, the 1.2 μF capacitor has a reactance of 2.653 kohm. By Ohm's law, the current is limited to 240 V/2653 Ω = 90 mA, assuming that voltage and frequency remain constant. LEDs are connected in parallel with the 10 μF electrolytic filter capacitor. The four branches with 12 LEDs consume about 20 mA each. The diodes limit the voltage to about 40 V per branch. Since, normally, the circuit is connected directly to the network without galvanic isolation, we need a residual-current circuit breaker in any type of protection circuit used for this kind of LED light.

Specifically and currently, the Foundation specialises in funding clean water for village communities. For example, it made a grant of £10,000 to international NGO WaterAid which funded the needy in Pakistan, where even a relatively small amount of funding goes a long way. The money was raised through the sale of Cobra Beer during the 2010 National Curry Week. History The Cobra Foundation was founded in 2005 by Lord Karan Bilimoria as the charitable arm of Cobra Beer and has continued its work since the formation of the joint venture between Molson Coors and the Cobra Partnership.

The notice reduced salaries for Members of Parliament from 851,000 Ksh to 532,500 Ksh per month. On 28 May 2013, the National Assembly unanimously voted to adopt the recommendations of the Committee on Delegated Legislation, finding that the SRC's notices were \\"unconstitutional, unlawful, ultra vires and therefore null and void.\\" On 12 June 2013, the SRC and the Parliamentary Service Commission agreed to maintain the reduced salaries, allowed for annual pay increases, and increased other allowances and benefits. * In November 2013, the parliament moved a motion to remove the cabinet secretary for Land, Housing and Urban Development, Charity Ngilu on grounds that she breached the Kenyan constitution by making some appointments at the ministry. She was accused of appointing the director-general without involving the parliament which is a requirement of the law.

Fowler was on progress with the King and returned with him to Falkland Palace, where he wrote to Walsingham about the possibility of gaining official diplomatic status.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 132-3. When Fowler resided at Whittingehame Tower, the home of Richard Douglas, in October 1589, James VI was told that Fowler planned to secretly leave Scotland from there.HMC Manuscripts, Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), pp. 346, 365, 399, 434–5. Fowler began to discuss the King's marriage plans with William Cecil, and the business of the Earl of Essex using code-names, which he learned from Richard Douglas and a former secretary of the Earl of Leicester code-named \\"Orlando.\\" In the code, the Earl of Essex was \\"Ernestus\\", Lord Riche \\"Richarddo\\", Lady Riche (a sister of Essex) \\"Rialta\\", James VI \\"Victor.\\" Cecil noted Fowler as \\"Fidelis\\", faithful. Fowler's letters are frequently cited by historians for their significant observations of the Scottish court and the Catholic Earls.Stewart, Alan, The Cradle King (2011), pp. 95, 100, 103. When Fowler suspected that James VI would sail to Norway to meet Anne of Denmark, Fowler was asked if he would accompany the Chancellor on the voyage, but he refused.HMC, Manuscripts, Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), pp. 435–6, 438–9: Murdin, William ed., Collection of State Papers left by William Cecil (London, 1759), pp. 636–40. At the end of October 1589 Fowler wrote a long letter to Cecil complaining about the English ambassador, William Asheby. Fowler claimed to have helped build Ashbey's connections, confidence, and influence at the Scottish court, but another English resident, Richard Wigmore, had influenced Ashby against him. He understood that Ashby had spoken against him to the king and to the Earl of Bothwell, and that his enemies were intercepting his letters. Wigmore, according to Fowler, guided Asheby like a child. He was forced to lodge in Edinburgh Castle for fear of Bothwell. Letters were taken from the messenger Robert Hudson.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 184-6, 192. Death A lake at the present day Settrington House, North Yorkshire Thomas Fowler died on 13 April 1590 in John Acheson's House in Edinburgh's Canongate, after becoming sick and speechless.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 4, p. 30. Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell seized his possessions which included a bond of payment for £400 lent to the English courtier of James VI, Roger Aston. Bothwell claimed that Fowler was illegitimate, he was certainly intestate, and so his possessions were the property of the Scottish crown. Bothwell's right to do this was disputed on behalf of the Lord Justice Clerk, Lewis Bellenden who was in Norway with the King.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 4 (London, 1892), pp. 29, 30. Attempts were made by the English ambassador Robert Bowes to recover property which had belonged to Arbella Stuart, but James VI claimed these were legacies to him from his grandmother Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox.Cooper, Elizabeth, Life and Letters of Lady Arabella Stuart (1866) pp. 100–2. The disputed property included a diamond cross, a tablet or locket with a diamond, a tablet with an agate on both sides, and a tablet with a ruby. There were also receipts from the Countess of Shrewsbury (Lady Talbot) for jewels received by Arbella.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (London, 1936), pp. 312-3. Fowler's son by his first wife, William Fowler, promised to restore these jewels to Arbella when he received the rest of father's property from the king. Bowes sent William Fowler to Cecil from Edinburgh. James would give to jewels to Arbella if he saw the Countess of Lennox's will.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (London, 1936), pp. 313, 329. Fowler's second wife Elizabeth married George Blenkoe and continued to farm the manor at Settrington, which they tenanted as Fowler's legacy from the Countess of Lennox.King, Herbert & Harris, Alan, ed., Survey of the Manor of Settrington, Yorkshire Archaeology Society (1962), p. 102: See Copsey, Nigel, & Wilson, Mark, Settrington Estate Lambing Sheds Conservation Management Plan, Earth, stone & Lime Company (2010), p.18, for discussion of relevant extracts from the survey.

The initial version was created in a 48-hour period for the 2013 Global Game Jam; the developers continued and spent 48 days creating a commercial version. The full version was released via Steam in April 2013, and GOG.com on 10 October 2013 followed by an iPad release on 7 March 2014. A sequel, Surgeon Simulator 2, was released in August 2020.  Gameplay  Surgeon Simulator is played in first-person perspective. Mouse movement is used to control the movement of the player's hand. By holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse, the player can rotate the hand. The left mouse button is used to lower the hand. By default, the A, W, E, R, and spacebar keys are used to control individual corresponding digits for grasping items. Gameplay consists of the player attempting to perform various surgical procedures, for example a heart transplant. Multiple extra modes are available after completion of the early operations, such as performing an operation while inside an ambulance where surgical instruments bounce around at random, and operating in space where the zero-g environment causes all of the instruments to free-float. Three free downloadable content (DLC) features and one paid DLC were added after release. The first was released on 21 June 2013, and features an operation in which the player performs surgery on Team Fortress 2s character Heavy, based on the \\"Meet the Medic\\" Team Fortress 2 promotional video. The second was released on 9 September 2013, named \\"Code Name Trisha\\", and features an operation in which surgery is performed on an alien. The third was released on 2 June 2016, named \\"Inside Donald Trump\\", in which a heart transplant is performed on then presidential candidate Donald Trump. On 14 August 2014, an Anniversary A&E; Edition was released on Steam. It added the eye and teeth transplants from the iOS version along with some other features, such as operating while running through the hospital corridors.  Plot  The game's protagonist is a surgeon named Nigel Burke, who has a placement at a fictional hospital somewhere in the United Kingdom. He carries out various operations, at first on a patient affectionately named 'Bob' by the game developers, and later operates on Bob inside a space station orbiting Earth. Afterwards, he is contacted by an alien race by VHS tape, and operates on one of the aliens, gaining the title of 'Best Surgeon in the Universe'.  Development  An initial version of Surgeon Simulator 2013 was created for the Global Game Jam in which the team had 48 hours to make the game. The team took inspiration from the game Jurassic Park: Trespasser for the control scheme, which also came about because teams in the jam would gain bonus points if a game used ten buttons on the keyboard. The team initially wanted to assign a finger to each button but soon realized this was impractical and instead only limited this style of control to one hand with the other being controlled by the mouse. The developers were initially unsure of whether or not the game was \\"genuinely\\" funny. Although they found themselves laughing they were not sure if it was the game or their sleep deprivation causing it. It was only when they finally presented the prototype to the audience that they realized the comic potential.  Release  In January 2014, Bossa released footage of an iPad release of the game to be released sometime that year. On 7 March, Surgeon Simulator (at the time called Surgeon Simulator 2013) was released and featured the classic heart and kidney transplants and two new transplants: eye and teeth. The app includes the new corridor feature in which the player has to save Bob while carts with at least seven items pass by and have to not kill him. There is a new feature, heart rate, which makes it more challenging for players and when it reaches 0, the player has to charge the defibrillators to save Bob. A PlayStation 4 version of the game was announced on 10 June 2014 and released on 12 August 2014. Featuring all of the games surgeries in every location. The PS4 version was released and named Surgeon Simulator: A&E; Anniversary Edition. A Nintendo Switch version was announced in July 2018 and released on 13 September 2018. This version is branded Surgeon Simulator CPR standing for \\"Cooperative Play Ready\\", as the game will include a special local cooperative mode, allowing two players using separate Joy-Con to control Nigel's arms.  Reception  Reception for the game has been mixed, with critics stating that although the game was hard to control, this difficulty was \\"part of the appeal.\\" Ars Technica commented upon the narrator's voice-over, saying that it \\"belies the ridiculousness that unfolds as he flops and flails his way through surgery\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game's humour and fun, and said \\"Surgeon Simulator 2013 is not a brilliant game. But it is a brilliant joke. In the form of a game. It’s an idea that is a clean magnitude of awesome above 90% of what will be released this year because it is so absurd.\\" Eurogamer rated the game 7/10 and also praised its humour. Surgeon Simulator 2013 has sold 2 million copies as of 4 February 2015.

In one major difference from the earlier V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the engines remain in place while the rotors and drive shafts tilt. A driveshaft runs through the straight wing, allowing both prop rotors to be driven by a single engine in the event of engine loss. The V-280 will have retractable landing gear, a triple-redundant fly by wire control system, and a V-tail configuration. The wings are made of a single section of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite, reducing weight and production costs. The V-280 will have a crew of four and be capable of transporting up to 14 troops. Dual cargo hooks will give it a lift capacity to carry a M777A2 Howitzer while flying at a speed of . The fuselage is visually similar to that of the UH-60 Black Hawk medium lift helicopter. When landed, the wing is in excess of 7 ft (2.1 m) from the ground, allowing soldiers to egress easily out of two wide side doors and door gunners to have wide fields of fire. Although the initial design is a utility configuration, Bell is also working on an attack configuration.Bell V-280 Valor Spotlighted at SOFIC - Defensemedianetwork.com, 23 May 2013. Whether different variants of the V-280 would fill utility and attack roles or a single airframe could interchange payloads for either mission, Bell is confident the Valor tiltrotor platform can fulfill both duties; the U.S. Marine Corps is interested in having one aircraft to replace utility and attack helicopters, but the Army, which leads the program, is not committed to the idea and wants distinct platforms for each mission. Bell and Lockheed claim an AV-280 variant can launch rockets, missiles, and even small unmanned aerial vehicles forward or aft with no rotor interference, even in forward flight and cruise modes with the rotors forward. GE Aviation will manufacture the engines for the V-280, with the prototype (air vehicle concept demonstrator, or AVCD) using the General Electric T64.Warwick, Graham. \\"Speed vs. cost\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology p. 31, 25 August 2014.

To do this, composites are used extensively in the wing, fuselage, and tail. Wing skins and ribs are made of a honeycomb-stiffened \\"sandwich\\" construction with large-cell carbon cores for fewer, larger, and lighter parts. Skins and ribs are paste-bonded together to eliminate fasteners. With these measures, costs are reduced by over 30 percent compared to a scaled V-22 wing.Affordability Challenge In Pursuit Of Army JMR/FVL - Aviationweek.com, 25 August 2014 Bell expects the V-280 to cost around the same as an AH-64E or MH-60M.V-280 fuselage delivery highlights focus on cost While the Osprey has a higher disk loading and lower hover efficiency than a helicopter, the V-280 will have a lower disk loading, and longer wing for greater hover and cruise efficiency. As the AW609 has already performed autorotation, it is expected that the V-280 (with similar disc loading) will demonstrate the same capability.

His works include painting, mosaic, fresco and sculpture. He had a distinguished career as an arts educator. Among his most notable works were the mural decoration of the World War II Rhone American Cemetery and Memorial battle monument in Draguignan, France; bas reliefs for the SS America, the SS United States, and Grace Line ships Santa Rosa and Santa Paula; mosaic work located in the East Apse of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC.; the decorative map in the Boston Federal Reserve Bank; and the spandrel sculpture on the barracks at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York.  Life  Purves was born on December 31, 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Austin M. Purves Sr., a financier and patron of the arts, and Betsey Preston Coleman Purves. He graduated from the Germantown Friends School in 1918. He wanted to be an artist from early childhood, later studying art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Julian Academy in Paris, France. He studied fresco painting at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France and traveled in Scandinavia, France and Italy, studying frescos in churches and municipal buildings. He received an award from the Department of Beaux Arts of France and an honorable mention from the Architectural League of New York for frescoes that he painted in a 13th-century church in Montarlot, France. Returning to the United States after his studies, he married and lived in New York, where he had a studio on the Lower East Side. He married his second cousin, Ellen Tybout Wood. Though her family was originally from Delaware, she grew up on Long Island. During his early married life, he worked for the design department at R H Macy's for a year and then found work painting murals for private homes. He became the Director of the Day and Night Schools at Cooper Union from 1931-1938, remaining for seven years. The 1934 Jubilee Issue of the Cooper Union Yearbook held this dedication: \\"To Austin Purves, Jr., Art Director of The Cooper Union, this Jubilee Issue of The Cable is respectfully dedicated as an appreciation of his distinguished service to the Institution, and with gratitude for his kindly helpfulness in the preparation of this volume.\\" Cooper Union in New York where Austin Purves was Director from 1931-1938 He continued to paint for private customers. He did several illuminations of prayers and painted an alms box for a church in Philadelphia. Purves' parents were friends of Maxfield Parrish and collected his work. Parrish became an artistic mentor to Purves from an early age. A correspondence started between the two artists when Purves was eleven years old and continued until Parrish was ninety. \\"Queen of Hearts\\", 1912, Maxfield Parrish, a friend of the Purves family, encouraged Austin in his artwork. Purves created \\"The Queen of Hearts\\" when he was 12 years old. The family moved to East Litchfield, Connecticut in 1936 as a result of Purves’ friendship with Ernest Howe, a student at Yale School of Art, where Purves taught in the summer during the 1930s. Ernest Howe offered Purves a place to stay in Litchfield during the summer months. Later, Purves purchased a house on Wheeler Road in East Litchfield and made a studio in a converted barn behind his house. He hired young art students to help with large jobs. The house initially had no electricity or central heating to start.  Work  In the 1930s, Purves was commissioned to do architectural paintings in the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC. In 1931-32 he was one of thirteen American artists invited to contribute a mural painting to hang in the Capital at the Smithsonian Museum for George Washington’s bicentennial celebration. His mural \\"The Building of Fort Necessity\\" measured 22’ x 13’. For the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, New York, he painted the exterior panels of the Temple of Religion, depicting various aspects of several religions. During World War II, he worked full-time for Civilian Defense, going around the state from his office at the Armory in Hartford where he was the Chairman and Secretary of the State Blackout Committee. During that time the Hartford Circus Fire occurred, from which he later drew painting for his brother. After the war, he resumed full-time work on various art projects. He created 265 aluminum wall sculptures representing the birds and flowers of all 48 states for the stairwells of the famed luxury passenger liner SS United States which launched in 1952. Other work for this ship included a large aluminum eagle insignia for the first class grand staircase and an etched glass back-drop in the bar. In later years he did aluminum bas reliefs as well as mosaic panels adorned with ancient South American motifs for the Santa Rosa, of Grace Lines. His decorative work on the ships SS America, SS United States, and Grace Line ships Santa Rosa and Santa Paula, spanned the years 1939-1959. The interior decorators for the ships also hired him as a consultant for the overall decorative design. He taught art at Bennington College part-time while working on interior decoration for the SS America. Purves designed and executed mosaics (1948-1955) for the chapel for the American Battle Monument Commission in Draguignan, France where 861 Americans are buried. They died in the campaign of Southern France, Operation Dragoon, launched on August 15, 1944, which assisted the Normandy operations. He made a mosaic column for Colgate University and designed a granite bas relief for a Boston bank (1950-1953). He painted the reredos for St. Paul's Church in Duluth, Minnesota and another for a Lutheran church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He painted a mural for the Philip Staats' house in Litchfield, and all four walls of a dining room for Margaret Howe Crapo in East Litchfield. In the early 1960s he created a large mosaic work located in the East Apse of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC. His last commission (1959-1961) was for West Point Academy, where he designed granite spandrels for three buildings and stone sculptures for three additional buildings.  Civic and volunteer contributions  Purves acted as Vice President of the Architectural League of New York and was President of the National Society of Mural Painters (1952-1953). He continued his association with the Cooper Union Art School by serving as a member of the Advisory Council and served for many years as a Trustee of the Hartford Art School, University of Hartford. East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Company where Austin Purves served many years as Commissioner During his 40 years in Litchfield, Connecticut he was active with St. Michael's Church, serving as vestryman and warden, teaching Sunday school, singing in the choir and serving on the building committee for a new church house. He took great interest and pride in the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department, which he helped to found and build. He served as the East Litchfield Fire Department’s Commissioner for many years and designed its logo. He was a director of the Litchfield Chapter of the American Red Cross and a president of the Litchfield Parent-Teacher's Association. Illuminated prayer by Austin Purves  Memorial  Austin Purves was a member of the Century Club of New York. One of its members, Goodwin Cooke, wrote of him in Century Memorials (Century Club Association magazine), \\"Much of Austin’s work was religious in nature; he was a scholar in the field of religious art and he was, unostentatiously, a profound Christian. He was in fact a well-rounded gentleman, versed in all branches and periods of painting, an eclectic and retentive reader, and had he not been a painter might well have become a musician. He was never stuffy, or bashful and indeed he cultivated a charming informality of manner. He was a delightful talker and he loved to listen as well-particularly to the young, with whom he had an engaging way and whom he never talked down to or patronized. His studio in East Litchfield was a center for a great number of aspiring painters and mosaicists.\\" He died on March 15, 1977 in Litchfield, Connecticut where he and his wife, Ellen Wood Purves made their home for 40 years and raised their children, Joan, Ellen, and Oliver.

Lucas is a member of West Coast Swim Club in Perth, and is coached and trained by Grant Stoelwinder. Lucas qualified for the men's 200 m individual medley at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by clearing a FINA A-standard entry time of 2:01.94 from the Olympic trials in Sydney. He challenged seven other swimmers on the seventh heat, including top medal favorite Michael Phelps. Lucas raced to seventh place by 0.37 of a second behind three-time Olympian Tamás Kerékjártó of Hungary in 2:02.12, but missed the semifinals by a hundredth of a second (0.01), as he placed seventeenth overall in the preliminaries. At the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montreal, Canada, Lucas rebounded another loss by missing the final of the 200 m individual medley, but urged to break a 2:02 barrier in 2:01.99. Lucas sought his bid to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He finished second behind Leith Brodie in 2:01.84 at the Olympic trials, but failed to attain a FINA A-cut of 2:01.40, just 0.34 of a second short of his entry time.

In 1866 his family returned to Duxbury, where he watched the landing of the French Atlantic Cable Company. He went to school in Bristol, Rhode Island, and he graduated from high school in Newport. Then he shipped on the Akbar during two years on a trip to Australia, but he left the sea and went to Chicago. He went to Kansas City where he was an express messenger for some time on the railroad, and then he was express agent in La Junta, Colorado, where he injured his leg by a package thrown into his car. He got a position in the Wells Fargo Express Co. and he was sent to Seattle as agent for the Northern Pacific Express Co. When he left it, during the rest of his life, he studied expert book keeping. During the First World War he was accountant for the Washington Shipping Corporation. Between 1928 and 1931 he made four ship models, Akbar, Conquest, Glory of the Seas, and Great Admiral.

It was also the series' penultimate entry, airing a week before the series finale. It originally aired on NBC on May 9, 2013. This episode guest stars Nora Kirkpatrick, Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, Mark McGrath, Santigold, Jessica St. Clair, and Rachel Crow. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) that he needs to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.); the two subsequently hold tryouts for the position. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her son, Phillip, to work, and Dwight thinks that he may be his son. Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) final fears about her husband's love are settled. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) attempts to get on America's Next A Cappella Sensation, but is not able to audition. Finally, all the members of the office gather at Poor Richard's Pub and watch the airing of the official in-series documentary. \\"A.A.R.M.\\" features a dramatic scene in which Jim presents a DVD of the highlights of his relationship with Pam, topped with him finally presenting her with a card he wrote in the second season episode \\"Christmas Party\\". The idea to have Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during \\"A.A.R.M.\\" did the writers feel it was the right time. In addition, the episode contained several scenes that were purposely staged to be reminiscent of past episodes of the series, with scenes mimicking unique shots in both the third season installment \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\" and the sixth season episode \\"The Delivery\\". The episode was also viewed by 4.56 million viewers and received a 2.3/6 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking third in its timeslot, making it the highest-rated episode of the season since the earlier entry \\"The Boat\\". \\"A.A.R.M.\\" received largely positive reviews from critics. The interaction between Jim, Pam, and Dwight received particular praise; many were particularly pleased with the call-back to \\"Christmas Party\\". Andy's audition subplot, however, was highly panned. Plot Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces regional manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) that he needs to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which Dwight himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, whom he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight that he needs to put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) returns to Scranton, after quietly quitting a week ago to work full-time at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand to spend some time with him in one way or another before he leaves for good. The office ultimately decides on one final dance together. Everyone has an incredibly fun time, and Darryl is glad he got to say a real goodbye. When Darryl runs into Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), he tells her about the company's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do something that he does not want to do. She confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be good enough for him. He asks the in-series documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of the highlights that they have collected of Jim and Pam's relationship. The final scene that they use is from the second season Christmas episode \\"Christmas Party\\" in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his accompanying note to her. After Pam watches the DVD, Jim presents her with the actual, unopened note. She reads it to herself, and, realizing that Jim does truly love her, the two happily embrace. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who had been fired in the previous episode, auditions for America's Next A Cappella Sensation. However, before he is able to try out, the judges close the auditions, sending home the remaining applicants, who have been standing in line for hours. Refusing to accept this, he bolts past security and argues with the judges to let him audition. When they refuse, he throws a crying tantrum. Later, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets his former office workers and is the tie-breaking vote to turn the TVs to the official airing of their documentary on PBS's Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV, rather than college baseball. All together, the office happily watches the opening of the pilot. Production Pop rock singer Mark McGrath was one of several guest stars for the episode \\"A.A.R.M.\\" was written by executive producer Brent Forrester, marking his eleventh writing credit for the series, his first since the earlier season episode, \\"Work Bus\\". It was directed by regular Office editor David Rogers, marking his ninth directing credit, and first since the earlier season episode \\"Junior Salesman\\". The episode was originally supposed to air as a half-hour episode, but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot. Unlike the previous episodes that were expanded, like \\"Moving On\\" and \\"Livin' the Dream\\", \\"A.A.R.M.\\" counts as two produced episodes. This episode guest stars Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, Mark McGrath, Santigold, and Jessica St. Clair. In order to get them, the show reached out to \\"a small group of celebrities that [the producers] thought would be good\\". Both Aiken and Santigold accepted. Baumgartner then asked Rodgers, who was a friend, and he accepted. McGrath later became available, and he was chosen as well. Angela's son, Phillip, was played by twins Vince and Evan Edwards. The child that filmed the scene in which Phillip picked the beet was only supposed to point to the beet. In the end, the child said \\"beet!\\", which Rogers called \\"amazing\\". The voice of the documentarian that responds to Jim is that of episode director David Rogers. Rogers also voiced the same character in the season opener \\"New Guys\\". Originally, showrunner and series creator Greg Daniels had re-recorded the line in \\"New Guys\\", but ended up liking Rogers' voice better. He asked him to reprise the role in \\"A.A.R.M.\\" to preserve continuity. Jules Kmetzko designed the portraits of Dwight and Mose, as well as Dwight's propaganda picture. He had previously created Pam's watercolor of Dunder Mifflin that hung on the walls. All of the dance moves were choreographed by Mary Ann Kellogg, who had choreographed many of the series' dance-heavy episodes. The obstacle course in the warehouse was crafted by Rogers and Forrester, with input from the show's art department. Wilson also helped, since he eventually was the one who ran through it; it was his idea to have the course terminate on a raised palette of boxes. Originally, the course was supposed to be in the parking lot, but Rogers moved it, feeling that the warehouse was \\"more organic\\" and that the heat would have been detrimental to the finished product. The idea to have Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during \\"A.A.R.M.\\" did the writers feel it was the right time. The card and envelope was the same one used for \\"Christmas Party\\" almost seven years prior. In fact, the card contained a genuine message that Krasinski wrote for Fischer. Rogers admitted that the Pam and Jim video was inspired by a number of fan videos that exist on the internet. The reason that \\"Open Your Eyes\\" by Snow Patrol plays over the video is that Claire Scanlon, the series editor, felt that it was similar in style to \\"Sing\\" by Travis, which played in the second season episode \\"The Client\\". The episode contained several scenes that were reminiscent of past episodes of the series. The shot in which Jim and Dwight survey the office was filmed to be similar to a scene that featured Dwight and Michael in the third season installment \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\". In addition, Dwight pulling Angela over was filmed in a way that recalled the sixth season episode \\"The Delivery\\". Although the scene wherein Jim gives advice to Dwight was shot in a similar manner to Jim's farewell to Michael in the seventh season episode \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", it was not intentionally supposed to look like it, according to Rogers. In addition, the obstacle course was not a direct reference to the second season episode \\"Office Olympics\\", although Rogers understood that there were similarities. Cultural references Jim references both Michael J. Fox and the 1985 film Back to the Future during his \\"nonsense\\" conference room meeting. Dwight realizes that Phillip is his son after the child looks at a small-scale replica of the Battlestar Galactica, fictional ship from the science fiction series of the same name, in the same way that Dwight does. Dwight's test to see if Phillip is his son has been compared to a similar scene in the 1997 film Kundun, in which Tibetan monks practice a similar ritual. To win over Kevin, Angela and Oscar pretend that baby Phillip presented him with an iTunes gift card. Darryl and the rest of the office dance to the song \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" by Earth, Wind, and Fire. The show Andy auditions for America's Next A Cappella Sensation, is a parody of popular singing shows like American Idol, The Voice, and The Sing-Off. The fictional show is hosted by Mark McGrath, the lead singer from the rock band Sugar Ray. The judges for the show include Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold. Rodgers is an American football quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Aiken is a singer who gained prominence following the second season of American Idol in 2003, and Santigold is an American singer, songwriter, and producer. Andy sings both the Cornell University alma mater (\\"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\\"), as well as \\"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\\" from the musical Annie. The woman auditioning that he interrupts is Rachel Crow, who achieved fame after competing in season one of The X-Factor. Reception Ratings \\"A.A.R.M.\\" originally aired on May 9, 2013 on NBC. In its original American broadcast, \\"A.A.R.M.\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.56 million viewers and received a 2.3 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a significant increase, of almost one million viewers, in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Livin' the Dream\\". It was also the most-watched episode of The Office since the earlier ninth season episode \\"The Boat\\", which had aired on November 8, 2012 and was watched by 4.83 million viewers. The episode ranked third in its half-hour timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC drama Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.1/9 rating and an entry of the CBS series Person of Interest which scored a 2.4/7 rating. The Office was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Reviews Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a positive review, and wrote that \\"as a quasi-finale, 'A.A.R.M.' was surprisingly ... terrific in most areas.\\" He particularly enjoyed the interaction between Jim and Dwight, calling it \\"so much fun\\"; he argued that the show would have probably fared better following Steve Carell's departure had the power dynamic and relationship between Jim and Dwight that was explored in \\"A.A.R.M.\\" been established earlier in the eighth season. He concluded that \\"The best parts of 'A.A.R.M.' felt like a fitting close to the non-documentary-viewing portion of the series.\\" M. Giant of Television Without Pity was pleased with the episode, and awarded it an \\"A\\" grade, the first for the series since \\"Goodbye, Michael\\" almost two seasons ago. Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote that the episode \\"was full of emotional moments that seemed like love letters to the fans who have watched the show since the pilot.\\" Mullins also praised the scenes between Jim and Pam, noting that \\"we collapsed in tears because the couple we've been rooting for ... can still find ways to make us cry.\\" Nick Campbell of TV.com felt that the episode was \\"a decent if uneven penultimate episode that gave us one last look at this quirky group of people in their office environment\\". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that \\"Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself\\". Campbell felt that the episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a \\"great\\" episode. She wrote that \\"The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close.\\" Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter \\"a slice of bliss\\". Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\". He said that \\"what benefits 'AARM' most ... is a back-to-basics Jim-and- Dwight storyline\\" that illustrated the growth that the characters have experienced in the last nine years. He wrote that there were many tender moments in the episode, such as Dwight and Jim's confrontation, Pam and Jim's reaffirmation of love, and Dwight's proposal to Angela. He concluded that \\"It's that blend of new beginnings and closing circles that makes 'AARM' an effective second-to-last chapter of The Office\\". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that the episode \\"didn't disappoint\\". He called \\"the scene in which Pam was watching the docu-created montage just as Jim was giving Dwight love advice\\" the \\"most emotionally rewarding moment on The Office since Michael Scott's goodbye.\\" Many critics were extremely pleased with the call back to the teapot and Jim's note from \\"Christmas Party\\". Adams felt that the scene, before the reveal of the note, was properly executed, and that the note made it even better. Sepinwall called it \\"a fabulous payoff for longtime fans\\". Cornet called the sequence \\"effective\\". Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote that it was a \\"nice move\\" on the part of the writers for \\"not letting us know what Jim wrote on the card from 'Christmas Party' [because] it has to be pretty epic.\\" Conversely, most critics gave Andy's plot a negative review. Sepinwall called the entire plot \\"godawfulness\\". Campbell referred to it as \\"a mediocre story that stood in stark contrast to the emotional timbre of the rest of the episode\\". Cornet called the scenes \\"just as disconnected from the core of the show as that character has for some time now.\\" Porter wrote that \\"the show never quite got a handle on what to do with the character this season\\", and his subplot in \\"A.A.R.M.\\" was the culmination of this issue.

Biography Fitzmaurice was born in Shropshire, England, in 1963. He studied painting at Leicester Polytechnic, Liverpool Polytechnic and Manchester Metropolitan University. After leaving college Fitzmaurice moved away from pure painting and his practice eventually focussed on a strategy of intervening in already existing objects, materials and situations, a way of working which continues to this day. Some of his earlier work was shown at EASTinternational in 1995 where one of his pieces was purchased for the Arts Council Collection. Also after graduating Fitzmaurice developed an interest in working in non-gallery situations by co- organising a number of 'artist-led' projects such as All in the Mind (1998), with artist Patricia McKinnon Day, which took place inside a disused mental asylum; and Up In The Air/Further Up In The Air (1999–2004) with artist Neville Gabie, which used tower blocks as contexts for art and writing. In these projects Fitzmaurice worked with the artists and writers George Shaw, Julian Stallabrass, Elizabeth Wright, Lothar Gotz, Will Self, Anna Fox, Marcus Coates and Bill Drummond amongst others.Further Up in the Air. Fitzmaurice, Leo; Gabie, Neville. (Eds). Furtherafield During this time Fitzmaurice continued to develop his own practice, exhibiting widely in shows such as Good Riddance at MOT, London, in 2007; the international sculpture show Blickachsen 6 in Germany the same year; Undone at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds in 2010 (which was reviewed in Art Monthly by David Briers); The Way We Do Art Now, curated by Pavel Buchler, at Tanya Leighton Gallery, London, also in 2010; Chain Chain Chain, 2012, at Bischoff Weiss, London, curated by Glenn Adamson; and Cosmos Levels, the same year, curated by Jamie Bracken Lobb at The Sunday Painter gallery, London. During this period Fitzmaurice developed the long-term project Post Match which was launched in 2009 with a publication by art agency Locus+.

Built in 1817 as a private academy, it has seen use as a parish hall, apartments, and a public school before its conversion to a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The East Windsor Academy building is located in East Windsor's Scantic village, on the east side of Scantic Road (Connecticut Route 191). It is a two-story brick building with a gable roof and a brownstone foundation. Its front facade is six bays wide, with entrances in the outer bays, and sash windows elsewhere. The side elevations feature fully pedimented gables with fanlights at the center. Windows are set in rectangular openings, with brownstone sills and splayed soldier brick headers. The school was built in 1817 as a private academy, a role it served until 1871, when the building was sold to the First Congregational Church for use as a parish hall. The prominent educator Ezra Stiles taught here for a time, and one of its better known pupils was Junius Morgan, father to financier J. P. Morgan. In 1896 the building again became a school, which eventually became a public school. This period of use closed in 1938, and it was later converted to apartments before being given to the local historical society. The property now also includes other buildings used as exhibit spaces by the society.

It is a variation on the term Livestrong, which was created in 2004. Since the phrase became popular it has been frequently placed on various kinds of signage and merchandise. The use of the term in Boston has led to similar phrases entering public discourse, such as America Strong. History In the hours after the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013, the slogan \\"Boston Strong\\" appeared as a highly popular hashtag on Twitter and rapidly spread around the world. It was a T-shirt campaign created by Christopher Dobens and Nicholas Reynolds, students at Emerson College. An expression of Boston's unity after the bombings, the slogan showed up on T-shirts and other products, and was emblazoned on the \\"Green Monster\\" wall at Boston's Fenway Park. The Boston Bruins displayed the slogan on their helmets at their game two days after the bombings, and at the first baseball game in Fenway Park after the bombings, the stadium announcer told the crowd: \\"We are one. We are strong. We are Boston. We are Boston strong.\\" On April 17, two days after the bombings, a T-shirt vendor and another private individual submitted separate trademark registration applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to obtain ownership of the \\"Boston Strong\\" slogan for use on commercial products. One of the applicants said he wanted the trademark in order to prevent people from outside the Boston area from benefiting from it. A trademark attorney was quoted in The Huffington Post as predicting that the government office would deny the registration on the grounds that the slogan was already in the public domain and could not be linked to any specific entity. The One Fund Boston, a trademark that received registration, collected and distributed over $80 million, is closed in 2015. In late May, a concert, Boston Strong: An Evening of Support and Celebration, was held at TD Garden with performances by Aerosmith, James Taylor, Bell Biv Devoe, New Kids on the Block J. Geils Band, Boston, Godsmack, Extreme, Jason Aldean, Jimmy Buffett, Carole King, Dane Cook and Steven Wright. The Boston Strong entertainment industry concert videos online and money they generate is not associated with the bostonstrong.org charity. The term has also made its way into many publications since the bombings, as well. The \\"Strong\\" slogan has been adopted by several cities affected by mass shootings and other tragedies since it first became popular in Boston. Etymology The roots of Boston Strong can be traced back to the Livestrong bracelets marketed by the Livestrong Foundation in 2003. The phrase can also be traced back to the United States Army's Army Strong motto, as well as Jersey Strong, which became popular in New Jersey following the destruction of Hurricane Sandy. Man-Made and Natural disaster non-entertainment news affiliates Boston Strong bostonstrong.com was created 11/29/2012, 15 months after affiliate VTstrong.com was created in 2011 following Hurricane Irene mountain floods. NewJerseyStrong.com was created 10/2012 as Hurricane Sandy struck the lower Atlantic. Criticism Wesley Lowery, then a reporter at The Boston Globe, tweeted in October 2013 that he thought the phrase had become overly commercialized, a view which drew criticism though Lowery's tweet specified he was \\"still inspired by the resilience of so many of those wounded in the marathon bombings.\\" A few weeks later, Bill Maher criticized the term, referring to a moment when he said: \\"You know again it was a bad day. Three people died that's terrible, more were maimed that's horrible, but unfortunately that happens every day in car accidents and everything else. I mean your city was not leveled by Godzilla.\\" The remarks came in response to the 2013 World Series celebration, when Boston Red Sox players Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Jonny Gomes walked to the finish line of the Boston Marathon and placed the World Series Trophy on the line, while the crowd sang \\"God Bless America\\". Former Mayor Thomas Menino later called Maher's comments \\"irresponsible.\\" In February 2014, a charitable organization in El Paso, Texas considered taking possible legal action against the Red Sox due to their using a variation of the slogan, \\"B Strong\\", which it started using seven years earlier.

Paton is also a member of Telopea Swim Club, and is coached and trained by Mark Skimming. Paton qualified for the women's 800-metre freestyle at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by clearing a FINA A-standard entry time of 8:34.70 from the Olympic trials in Sydney. She challenged seven other swimmers on the second heat, including former bronze medalist Jana Henke of Germany and top medal favorite Diana Munz of the United States. Paton cruised to fourth place by five seconds behind Munz in 8:35.81, but missed the final by more than a second, as she placed ninth overall in the preliminaries. Shortly after the Olympics, Paton finished fourth behind her teammate Melissa Gorman, but dipped under 8:30 barrier in the same distance at the FINA World Short Course Swimming Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana, with a time of 8:25.38. In 2005, Paton won her first ever individual career title in the 1500 m freestyle at the Australian long course championships in Sydney, in a qualifying entry time of 16:17.20. Paton's effort and triumph from the trials moved her up to third in the world rankings for the said distance. At the FINA World Championships in Montreal, Canada, Paton missed the final with a tenth-place finish in the 1500-metre freestyle, outside her entry time of 16:37.18. In 2006, Paton moved to England to train and take up an academic scholarship with a degree in sports performance at the University of Bath.

The complex includes the original main building, which has been repeatedly enlarged and now houses 66 units for single women, and a series of additional buildings which are designed for single women with children. The organization was founded in 1885, funded by a bequest from Cornelius Erwin which provided for the establishment of homes for \\"worthy women of limited means\\". Erwin was a prominent local businessman and a member of the South Church, to whose administration he left the bequest.

It underwent enlargements in a stylistically similar manner in 1894 and 1914, and was enlarged to its present U shape by further additions in the 1970s. In the 21st century it acquired further properties for supporting women with children. When the home opened its doors, rents were fixed at $2/month, and now stand at $250 for eligible women.

It served in the Home Defence forces and never went overseas. Home Defence On the outbreak of the First World War, the Territorial Force (TF) immediately mobilised for home defence, but shortly afterwards (31 August 1914), its units were authorised to raise 2nd battalions formed from those men who had not volunteered for, or were not fit for, overseas service, together with new volunteers, while the 1st Line went overseas to supplement the Regulars.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. Early in 1915 the 2nd Line TF battalions were also raised to full strength to form new divisions, and began to form Reserve (3rd Line) units to supply drafts.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 6, 65. The remaining Home Service men were separated out in May 1915 to form brigades of Coast Defence Battalions (termed Provisional Battalions from June 1915). 6th Provisional Brigade 6th Provisional Brigade was formed mainly from details of regiments from London and East Anglia, with the following composition:6th Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives, Kew file WO 95/5458. * 6th Provisional Yeomanry Squadron * 6th Provisional Cyclist Company * 6th Provisional Battery and Ammunition Column Royal Field Artillery * 6th Provisional Brigade Ammunition Column RFA * 6th Provisional Field Company Royal Engineers * 61st Provisional BattalionBecke, Pt 2b, pp. 101–5 from home service details of the Norfolk Regiment * 100th Provisional Battalion from home service details of 173rd (3/1st London) Brigade (3/1st, 3/2nd. 3/3rd and 3/4th (City of London) Battalion, the London Regiment)Grimwade, p. 117. * 101st Provisional Battalion * 102nd Provisional Battalion * 6th Provisional Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps * 6th Provisional Brigade Train Army Service Corps (previously Welsh Divisional Train, left behind when the 53rd (Welsh) Division embarked for Gallipoli in July 1915)Becke Pt 2a, p. 122.

The division was based on 6th Provisional Bde, which moved from Suffolk and provided four infantry battalions and many of the support units. (On 1 January 1917 these all received new designations and numbers.) In addition, 190th (2nd Durham Light Infantry) Brigade, left over after the earlier disbandment of 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division, was brought from Catterick and renumbered. 64th (2nd Highland) Division at Catterick also provided a number of artillery batteries.

It now formed part of Southern Army of Home Forces and was responsible for defence of the Essex coast from Mersea Island to Walton-on-the-Naze. In April, 226th Mixed Brigade (formerly 7th Provisional Brigade) at Clacton-on-Sea was attached to the Division. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. Henceforth part of the role of the Home Service divisions was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas, alongside units of the Training Reserve. 'Graduated Battalions' of the Training Reserve were organised in four companies according to age, from 18 to 19 years. Recruits progressed from one to another company every three months, so that every three months there was a company of trained 19-year-old men available for drafting overseas. In July 1917 it was decided that the Graduated Battalions could serve in a Home Defence role while completing their training.Becke, Pt 2b, Appendix 2. Between July and September 1917, six Graduated Battalions replaced other units in 71st Division, and in October these were affiliated to line regiments and adopted territorial designations. In October 1917, 214 Bde was formed into a Special Brigade for service at Murmansk, for which it was filled up with men of A1 medical category, and had a field artillery brigade, cyclist battalions and machine-gun companies added to its strength. However, apart from its Royal Engineers it never went to Russia, and was still in 71st Division in early 1918.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 82, 105. Disbandment Towards the end of December 1917 the War Office decided to break up the three home service divisions. A number of battalions of 71st Division were disbanded that month, and on 12 January 1918 the War Office ordered the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to break up the remainder of the division without delay. During February, 214th Special Brigade and 226th Mixed Brigade, with their attached troops, were transferred to 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division, and the six Graduated Battalions were transferred to 64th (2nd Highland) Division. CCCL Field Bde RFA moved to the School of Artillery at Larkhill Garrison and the Field Companies RE went overseas on active service. Disbandment of the remainder of the brigade headquarters and supporting units was complete by 8 April 1918. The 71st Division title has never been reactivated.

Early years Etienne- Benoît Larue was born on 12 June 1865 in Saint-Christophe-en-Brionnais, France. On 28 May 1891 he was ordained a priest of the White Fathers (Society of Missionaries of Africa). For a period he was a lecturer of moral theology at the White Fathers' Seminary in Carthage. He was regional superior of the Apostolic Vicariate of Nyasa before being appointed Vicar Apostolic of Bangueolo. Vicar Apostolic On 28 January 1913 the Apostolic Vicariate of Bangueolo was separated from that of Nyassa. The new vicariate of Bangweulu covered the Northern and Luapula Regions, while the southeast part kept the name Nyassa. Bishop Mathurin Guillemé continued to administer the vicariate of Nyassa from Bembeke. Larue was appointed Titular Bishop of Thuburbo Minus and Vicar Apostolic of Bangueolo. He was based at Chilubula. Larue was ordained bishop on 1 April 1913 by Bishop Henri-Raymond Villard. Larue did not at first see secular education as part of the mission's role, saying in 1924, \\"The chapels have nothing to do with the schools. This is the tyranny of the Protestants, driven no doubt by the English administration.\\" However, the Vatican felt otherwise, and in 1926 issued an Encyclical on Catholic Education. The church leaders felt developing an educated Catholic elite was of great importance. In 1928 Larue made a rule that each Christian adult had to pay a tithe of three pennies per year, in cash or kind, or they would not be allowed to receive sacraments at their village, although they could receive sacraments elsewhere. In 1930 Larue turned down a request to take responsibility for missionary work in the Lambaland mining region since he felt his missionaries were needed to support the fast-growing population of converts in his largely-rural vicariate. Etienne died on 5 October 1935. Views Larue tended to take a legalistic view of the relationships between the mission, the local people and the colonial authorities. His views are often given in terms of rights and duties. Thus he felt that non-believers had a duty to be taught the Catholic faith, and that once baptized they lost some rights, such as the right to a civil divorce. He was willing to collaborate with the administration. He felt that the civil power and the mission had different areas of authority, which were usually not in conflict. As a result of Laroue's insistence on obligations, some people came to think that the missionaries derived authority from the government, and even that they were paid by the government.

Although he appeared frequently on stage and television, it was as a radio actor that he came to be best known. His many radio roles ranged widely, from farce to Shakespeare and new works. In addition to acting he also wrote for radio. As a historian Usher specialised in English ecclesiastical history of the 16th and 17th centuries, with particular focus on the Puritans. The first part of his study of church and state politics of Elizabeth I's reign, William Cecil and Episcopacy 1559–1577, was published in 2003. The second part, Lord Burghley and Episcopacy, 1577–1603, which was nearly complete at the time of Usher's death, was published in 2016. Life and career Education and acting career Usher, who was the only child of Dennis Paget Louis Usher and his wife Margot, was born at Southgate in Middlesex. He was educated at Brentwood School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied history. His interest in acting developed at school, where he played several leading parts including Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream and the title role in Richard II. At Cambridge a wider range of acting opportunities was open to him. Among many roles he played Berowne in Love's Labour's Lost for the Marlowe Society, a production that was taken to the Edinburgh Festival. His performance as Joseph Surface in The School for Scandal was praised by the reviewer in The Times: The culmination of Usher's undergraduate acting career was the title role in Hamlet in 1968, also for the Marlowe Society.

In this book Usher examined how Elizabeth I's chief minister, William Cecil, helped the queen to restore religious stability to a country wracked by two decades of divisions and uncertainty. A key to this was the future structure of the church, and Usher analysed the role of the bishops and their relationships with Cecil. The book received numerous favourable reviews, praising its combination of scholarship and readability. The Church Times said, \\"Readers who like detective stories... will enjoy Usher's verve in turning taxation, land exchanges and long leases into a story of politics, personalities and ecclesiastical intrigue\\".MacCulloch, Diarmid. \\"Why we have bishops\\", The Church Times, 7 May 2004, p. 20 The reviewer in the Sixteenth Century Journal praised the book for correcting two widespread misconceptions about the church history of the period: \\"it puts paid to the idea that Elizabethan government intentionally exploited sede vacante opportunities; and it gives the reader a clear picture of hardworking, conscientious bishops, laying to rest the old chestnut that they were merely timeserving opportunists.\\"\\"William Cecil and Episcopacy, 1559–1577\\" , Lund Humphries and Ashgate.

The Renaissance style building was designed by New York City architect Edward Tilton, and completed in 1917 with funding from Andrew Carnegie.http://www.necarnegies.com/ctunionville.htm The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history Farmington's former West End Library is located in the center of Unionville village, on the south side of School Street west of Connecticut Route 177. It is a single-story building, with load-bearing brick walls finished in stucco, and a red tile roof. Its main facade is seven bays wide, with a projecting gable-roofed entry portico in the center bay. The other bays have tall round- arch windows, with small rectangular transom-like windows set above, just below the roofline, with diamond grillwork. The Unionville Library Association was founded in 1902, with its collection occupying a small room in Farmington's town hall, then located nearby this building's site. It grew rapidly in size and usage, and the need for a larger and more permanent home was evident. This building was built in 1917, funded in part by a grant of $8,500 from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Designed by Edward Tilton, it is based in simplified and reduced form on the McKim Building of the Boston Public Library. In the 1960s library services moved from the building. It was then used by the town as a senior center for a time, and in 1984 the building opened as a museum.

Initiated in 1978, the event went into a hiatus after being held for the 7th time in 2002 but was restored after almost 11 years in 2013.  History  The history of Bangladesh Games can be traced back to the British colonial period in the Indian Subcontinent. The Indian Olympic Association was formed in 1927 and the first ever National Games of India was held in 1934. Athletes from present day Bangladesh participated in the event representing the Bengal Province. After the Partition of India in 1947, Bangladesh became a part of the newly created nation of Pakistan. The Pakistan Olympic Association was established in 1948 and from the same year it began to organize the National Games of Pakistan. Bangladeshis used to participate in the event representing the East Pakistan province. Dhaka was the host city of the event in four occasions, in 1955, 1960, 1964 and 1968. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the sports officials in the country felt the need to organize a Bangladeshi version of such a national event. The first edition of Bangladesh Games was held in 1978 from 15 to 19 March under the name Bangladesh Olympic Championships. However, the inception of the event was distinct from those of India and Pakistan, as it was initiated before the formal establishment of the national Olympic committee of Bangladesh in 1979. The first edition of the event featured athletics, basketball, boxing, cycling, gymnastics, shooting, swimming, volleyball, weightlifting and wrestling. The second edition was held in 1980, as it was decided to hold the event in biennial manner. At this time, some subsequent changes were made in the formation of the event. The title was changed into Bangladesh Games and it was decided to hold the event in every four years. Accordingly, the third edition of the event was held in 1984. The event had been organized regularly until the seventh edition which was scheduled to take place in 2000 but was held in 2002. The eighth edition of the event was held in 2013, after almost eleven years from the previous edition and five years from the scheduled date. To revive the popularity of the event, a gala opening ceremony was held prior to the beginning of the event. This edition featured 31 disciplines having 346 events with almost ten thousand athletes, officials and staffs involved with it.

Located about 40 kilometers from Ellora, the site is reached by a steep climb down a flight of concrete stairs, past a waterfall next to the caves. Description The caves are cut in a variety of basalt rock, but some of the caves have crumbled and are damaged. Out of the 14, four are chaityas (one housing votive stupas, one apsidal and single-cell) and the rest are viharas. All the caves belong to the Hinayana period, but the reasonably well preserved paintings are of the Mahayana period. The caves are in two groups, one of 10 caves and the second of four. It is believed that Pitalkhora can be identified with Ptolemy’s \\"Petrigala\\" as well as the \\"Pitangalya\\" of Mahamayuri, a Buddhist chronicle. The inscriptions date from c. 250 BCE to the 3rd and 4th centuries CE.Pitalkhora Caves at Archaeological Survey of India. The site shows statues of elephants, two soldiers of which one is intact, a damaged Gaja Lakshmi icon, and an ancient rainwater harvesting system.

Chronology of the Chaitya hall (Cave 3) The Chaitya hall, Cave 3 of Pitalkhora, represents an important marker in the chronology of the Chaitya hall design in western India. It is thought that the chronology of these early Chaitya Caves is as follows: first, in the 1st century BCE, Cave 9 at Kondivite Caves and then Cave 12 at the Bhaja Caves, which both predate Cave 10 of Ajanta. Then, after Cave 10 of Ajanta, in chronological order: Cave 3 at Pitalkhora, Cave 1 at Kondana Caves, Cave 9 at Ajanta, which, with its more ornate designs, may have been built about a century later, Cave 18 at Nasik Caves, and Cave 7 at Bedse Caves, to finally culminate with the \\"final perfection\\" of the Great Chaitya at Karla Caves.

Biography  He was the son of Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i, who along with Abu Muslim led the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad Caliphate. Along with his brother Humayd, Hasan was active in the Abbasid cause in Khurasan during the years before the Revolution, serving as a deputy naqib.Crone (1980), p. 188 During the Revolution itself, together with his father he was one of the principal commanders in the campaign that brought the Abbasid armies from Khurasan into Iraq; he took part in the pursuit of Nasr ibn Sayyar and the victory at Nihavand, and despite his father's death in battle against the Umayyad governor Yazid ibn Umar al-Fazari, Hasan led the Khurasani army into Kufa.Zarrinkub (1999), pp. 54–55Kennedy (1986), p. 79 After the Revolution, Hasan served the future Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775) as deputy governor in Armenia, which he helped pacify, and sided with Mansur against the rebellion of Abdallah ibn Ali in Syria in 754. After this, he was occasionally appointed to the frontier with the Byzantine Empire, where he led the summer raids into Asia Minor in 766, 779 and 780.Lilie et al.

Although distinguished as a member of the abna al-dawla, the Abbasid regime's Khurasani elite, and very wealthy—like most Abbasid commanders, he received portions of the newly built capital, Baghdad, as a grant—Hasan played scarcely any political role at court. He died in 797 at the age of 84. His sons, Muhammad, Ali, and Sa'id, also held gubernatorial positions in various provinces. In the Fourth Fitna, they all sided with al-Amin against al- Ma'mun.Kennedy (1986), p. 80 As with most of the old Abbasid families, they lost power, although not their wealth, after the triumph of al-Ma'mun in the civil war.

The Nordfriedhof is in the district of Albertstadt and is situated to the north-east of the inner city, near the south-western edge of the Dresdner Heide. Near the cemetery grounds of about 4 hectares, accessible via the Marienallee as well as the Kannenhenkelweg, are the Army Officer School and the Cemetery of the Soviet Garrison of Dresden (Sowjetischer Garnisonfriedhof Dresden). It was established in 1900 as the \\"Garrison Cemetery\\" (Garnisonfriedhof) to deal with the fatalities from the nearby military hospital and was subsequently enlarged. After the end of World War II it was turned into a civilian cemetery and renamed. Memorial for the fallen of World War I of the Dresden Garrison Tomb of Paul von der Planitz  History  As a consequence of the Franco-Prussian War the Saxon Army was modernised. As part of the reorganisation large barracks were built in the 1870s in the Albertstadt to plans by the Kingdom of Saxony Minister of War Fabrice. These included a large military hospital north of the cadet accommodation of the officers' school, now in the grounds of the Albertstadt Barracks. In about 1900 Paul von der Planitz, Fabrice's successor at the Ministry of War, proposed the establishment of a military cemetery so that those soldiers who died in the hospital, as well as their dependants and servants, could be buried close by. On 1 October 1901 the Nordfriedhof was formally dedicated, under the name Garnisonfriedhof (\\"Garrison Cemetery\\"). The first burial took place in December of that year. The chapel was dedicated in 1902. Initially the walled cemetery comprised a rectangular area of about one hectare. An extension became necessary in World War I, for the fallen of which a separate area was opened from 1917, to the east of the old walled area. Plaques of honour, created by Emil Hartmann, were donated and erected here by the regimental associations. Besides more than 2,000 members of the German Army, Serbian, Russian, French and Czech prisoners of war were buried here. From 1922 to 1947 a bronze monument by Max Lange, of considerable artistic reputation, stood here, representing two soldiers in a fight to the death. It was melted down by order of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. A memorial service to the honour of the fallen was held here every year on or about the feast of Saint John the Baptist (24 June). In 1930 the cemetery was renamed as the Standortfriedhof. During World War II it was necessary to enlarge the cemetery a second time, which was easily achieved as it is entirely surrounded by woodland. This third area was set up in about 1940 and surrounded by a wall, including the area of the first extension. More than 700 German soldiers of the Wehrmacht are buried here, as well as foreign forced labourers in 11 mass graves and more than 100 conscientious objectors, who were either executed or committed suicide. After the air raids of February 1945 on Dresden more than 450 of those killed were buried here, principally fire brigade members and soldiers; they are commemorated by a memorial stone. The great majority of the victims of 13-14 February are buried in the Heidefriedhof, however. Shortly after the end of the war the name of the cemetery was again changed, this time to the Nordfriedhof. At this time, directly over the street, by the order of the Soviet forces of occupation, the Sowjetischer Garnisonfriedhof Dresden (\\"Cemetery of the Soviet Garrison of Dresden\\") was opened, for the dead of the Soviet Army. Also in the Nordfriedhof is a columbarium containing approximately 5,500 urn burials from the 1950s and 1960s. The cemetery has been a protected monument since 1987. Today it is a municipal cemetery for civilian burials.

PubMed Central is the self-archiving repository in which authors or their publishers deposit their publications. Copyright is retained by the usual holders, but authors may submit papers with one of the Creative Commons licenses. Description The NIH Public Access Policy applies Division G, Title II, Section 218 of PL 110-161 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008) which states: The policy was initially implemented by the NIH as a voluntary policy in 2004.\\"Enhanced public access to NIH research information\\" (Notice NOT-OD-04-064, NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts, 3 September 2004).

Journals with agreements with NIH submit final published versions of papers. For other publishers, authors are required to submit papers when they are accepted for publication. The NIH grant holder is responsible for ensuring this. The author, publisher, or institution continues to hold the copyright as usual. The author may choose to include the article in the Open Access Subset by using one of the Creative Commons licenses. Publishers may require that \\"public access\\" be delayed up to 12 months after publication. Only the author's final draft needs to be published, not any contributions made by the publisher. PubMed Central is the designated repository for papers submitted in accordance with the NIH Public Access Policy and for those that fall under similar policies from other funding agencies. By April 2014, the NIH had increased enforcement of compliance with its Public Access Policy by delaying continuing grant payments for noncompliance. Public Access Compliance Monitor The Public Access Compliance Monitor (PACM or \\"compliance monitor\\") is a service from the National Library of Medicine that helps users at NIH-funded institutions locate and track the compliance of funded papers with the NIH Public Access Policy at an institutional level. Authorized members of an institution can get a quick snapshot of their institution's compliance rate or help researchers achieve compliance. PACM provides users with a list of all PubMed citations associated with an institution's NIH funding and classifies the articles according to compliance status (i.e., Compliant, Non-Compliant, In Process). The compliance monitor also provides detailed information about each article including: *a full citation including the PMID (PubMed ID) and link to the PubMed record *associated grants and principal investigators *NIHMSID (NIH Manuscript Submission Reference Number), where available *PMCID (PubMed Central ID), where available *key names and dates in the NIHMS, where available *article compliance status *method A status *journal publisher Compliance reports can be downloaded from these lists and the data filtered based on an institution's needs. Response Peter Suber described the policy as \\"the first open access mandate for a major public funding agency in the United States; it is also the first one for a public funding agency anywhere in the world that was demanded by the national legislature rather than initiated and adopted independently by the agency.\\" In the first few years after the policy was introduced, there were two major legislative efforts to reverse it, primarily driven by some publishers' objections. According to Patrick Ross, the director of the Copyright Alliance: \\"The mere fact that a scientist accepts as part of her funding a federal grant should not enable the federal government to commandeer the resulting research paper and treat it as a public domain work.\\" The Fair Copyright in Research Works Act was a bill sponsored by John Conyers in 2008 and 2009 that sought to reverse the NIH policy. It failed to leave committee either year. In 2011 the Research Works Act was introduced to end the policy. It died after protests from the academic community and science publisher Elsevier's withdrawal of support. In 2013 a survey of persons receiving NIH funding and therefore subject to the NIH Public Access policy reported that among 94 respondents, 30% had little understanding of the NIH Public Access Policy and all but two of them said that they accepted the default terms of their copyright forms \\"as is\\".

He soon regretted his decision, however, and escaped Abdallah's camp before his final defeat.Kennedy (1986), p. 80 Nevertheless, he was soon entrusted with governorships by Mansur, first in the Jazira (754/55), where he faced a determined Kharijite rebellion, and then in Egypt (759/61).

Starting from Padi Junction, the road connects the neighbourhoods of Padi, Ambattur, Thirumullaivoyil, Avadi, Pattabiram, Thirunindravur, and Thiruvallur. It is one of the four national highways that radiates out of Chennai city and is part of National Highway 205. The road, however, is narrow with a width of 8 to 10 metres as its widest stretches. Over 100,000 passenger car units use the road every day. The road The road begins at Padi junction in Chennai and runs about 22 km in the Chennai metropolitan area (CMA) up to Thirunindravur, from where it runs a further 59 km to reach Tiruttani. According to official CMDA records, this road is supposed to be 32 meters wide or 100 ft wide, but currently it is only 10–12 meters or 30 ft wide in many stretches. Developments In 2013, the government announced that the 22-km stretch of the road between Padi and Thiruninravur would be widened into a six-lane facility. It was announced that in the first phase, the road would be developed into a four-lane facility at a cost of 980 million. However, some traders' federations, including the Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai, were against the proposal to make it a six- lane road for about a decade. On 4 October 2013, the Tamil Nadu Highways department issued a GO extending the entire stretch of the road till Tirutani to 6 lanes at a cost of 1,680 million, by means of land acquisition from 12 villages. In the first phase, the road will be widened to 100 ft (4 lanes) with center median at a cost of 980 million. As of 30 June 2014, CTH Road is being re-laid end to end and for the first time in history of this road, a proper center median is placed. Tamil Nadu Government, under Jayalalitha is delivering to the safety and security of millions of residents along this stretch by properly developing this road, which has been languishing for the past 20 years. Local residents cheer the move. 4 Laning is currently underway and 6 laning planning is in full swing. Nine out of the 13 revenue villages in this 22 km stretch have submitted the proper legal documents. Heavy Encroachments on government land on both sides of the road in Ambattur OT and in few other stretches are still creating issues to the commuters, but residents are determined to shun these encroachment traders who are creating hell and havoc for millions of residents who travel in this stretch. Many thousand innocent people die in this stretch due to these encroachment traders. Residents continue to praise the work of Chief Minister, the TN State highway authorities and honest officers of the local municipality, who are helping to re-laying this road, rather than budging for the pressure from politically affiliated encroachment traders. In 2019, three flyovers were planned on the 22-km road at three junctions, viz. the Korattur Road junction, the Vanagaram Road junction, and the Mount Poonamallee–Avadi Road junction at a total cost of ₹8,500 million.

He was re-elected segundo alcalde of the commune in 1903. However, on 7 May 1905, just one year short of his term expiral, José María Caro Martínez resigned as mayor and decided to complete his term only as a regidor. In spite of this, the City Council named Francisco Javier Asalgado as the acting primer alcalde. He served the remainder of Caro Martínez's term, which would last until the next year. He was elected primer alcalde in the election of 1906. He ran again for primer alcalde of Pichilemu in 1909.

The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard Section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Premise The story is based on the loss of a mother and the struggles the family endure by going the distance to her burial ground in her home town. Cast * James Franco as Darl Bundren * Logan Marshall- Green as Jewel Bundren * Danny McBride as Vernon Tull * Tim Blake Nelson as Anse Bundren * Ahna O'Reilly as Dewey Dell Bundren * Beth Grant as Addie Bundren * Jim Parrack as Cash Bundren * Jesse Heiman as Jody * Scott Haze as Skeet MacGowan Production James Franco decided to write a screenplay of the novel with a fellow Yale graduate student Matt Rager. The novel As I Lay Dying was described as a story impossible to be transformed into a film due to the multi-narrative voices within it. Franco saw this as a challenge and chose to depict the many voices through choices of styling, through camera edits. Faulkner told the story in a chorus of voices: 15 narrators in the 59 chapters. To locate an equivalent for the novel’s polyphonal scheme, Franco employed the use of narrative expressed through dialogue and voice overs. Release The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on September 27, 2013 but Millennium Films scrapped the plans. It was released on October 22, 2013 to iTunes and November 5, 2013 to DVD/VOD platforms. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise and criticism focused on Franco's methods of presenting Faulkner's complex narrative. It holds a 40% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews with an average rating of 4.7/10. Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Kyle Smith of the New York Post was very harsh, declaring, \\"Franco dilutes the drama with first-year-film-student gimmicks, like split screens and slow motion, it just seems like a dull collection of pointless monologues from actors who can’t even be bothered to match up their accents.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \\"But in rushing in where wise men might fear to tread, Mr. Franco has accomplished something serious and worthwhile. His As I Lay Dying is certainly ambitious, but it is also admirably modest. The script, written by Mr. Franco with Matt Rager, tries to pare Faulkner's multivoiced narrative to a manageable essence.\\" References External links * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 drama films Category:2013 direct-to-video films Category:Films based on works by William Faulkner Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by James Franco Category:Films based on American novels ","title":"As I Lay Dying (film)"},{"id":"39168226","text":"LISA Academy North is an open-enrollment public charter high school located near North Little Rock in Sherwood, Arkansas, United States.

Ministry Lee, a former newspaper reporter, was ordained deacon in 1967 and priest in 1968. He served as deacon at St John's Cathedral in Jacksonville, Florida from 1967 till 1968, and then as assistant minister at St John's Church in Washington, D.C. till 1971. He served as Rector at the Chapel of the Cross (Chapel Hill, North Carolina) from 1971 to 1984. Elected Coadjutor Bishop in the Diocese of Virginia, the largest Episcopal diocese in the country, Lee was consecrated and served from 1984 to 1985, until the retirement of Bishop Robert Bruce Hall. Lee then served as Bishop from 1985 until his own retirement in 2009, having Shannon Sherwood Johnston as Coadjuter Bishop in his final years. Beginning early in Lee's episcopate, several conservative congregations stopped paying diocesan dues, citing objections to the ordination of women priests, as authorized by the General Convention. The controversy metamorphosed, with the stated primary objections changing to matters of sexuality with the consecration of bishop Gene Robinson of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire in 2003, and the election of Katharine Jefferts Schori as Presiding Bishop in 2006. Two large Virginia parishes attracted national attention by attempting to leave the Diocese and associate with an African diocese while keeping their Virginia churches and other property. Lee sued to have the facilities declared the property of the Diocese, and was ultimately successful, although that resolution only happened under his successor. From 2009 to 2010, Lee officiated as Interim Dean at the Grace Cathedral (San Francisco). He served the General Theological Seminary of New-York in the same position from 2010 to 2011. Then he moved to France and became Interim Dean and Rector at the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris in 2011 and 2012. From 2013 to 2014, he was Provisional Bishop in the Diocese of East Carolina. In November 2015, he was announced as the Assisting Bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina.

It has a volume of 146 m³ and this makes it the biggest reservoir in the Basque Country. The area of land all around the reservoir is called Arrazua-Ubarrundia and it is famous for its routes for tracking.  History  Ullíbarri-Gamboa reservoir near the concrete dam The reservoir was built in the 1950s, when Spain was under the term of office of Francisco Franco. All started in 1926 when Manuel Uribe-Echevarría asked for a new reservoir between Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz, because of the demand of electricity after the industrial revolution and the growth of population. Unfortunately this construction was refused to be done in 1928. Later, in the second Spanish republic (1935), they approved the construction of the reservoir but it was not until 1945 when they started working on that, due to delays deliberated by the civil war. In this year Altos Hornos de Vizcaya S.A. was the company that started the project with the help of Saltos y Aguas del Zadorra. The works started in 1947 and finished in 1957 and were built by more than 3,500 men.  Problems  The Gamboa valley was the place where nowadays is the reservoir. In this valley were villages like Azua, Garaio, Landa, Larrinzar... and much more. All this villages were affected by the works and they could not do anything against it. Mendizabal, Landa and Zuazo de Gamboa were completely flooded under the water and other villages were also affected but not as bad as there. The people who lived in this villages lost their homes, properties and lands, consequently they all moved to other places to live. Nowadays, in summer, when the water level is low, all these ruins can be seen down the water. The fauna and the flora were also affected by these changes. Some plants were broken and drowned by the water while others adapted to the aquatic life and some seaweed developed. With the time this ecosystem has turned in an aquatic ecosystem and it became a Ramsar Site and part of the Natura 2000 network.  Islands  Zuaza Island The reservoir surrounds three islands, Zuhatza, The island of the Horses and Orenin.  Zuhatza  This island provides little cabins to stay all around the island. It may be famous for its large number of rabbits and it is also called the island of the rabbits. It offers the possibility to practice many aquatic sports, such as windsurfing, sailing, rowing and canoeing.  The island of the horses  It is an island next to Zuhatza which does not provide as much as Zuhatza island does.  Orenin  Before the reservoir was constructed, it was a village that could be accessible by car, but after the reservoir it ended up being an isolated small island. Nowadays it is abandoned but it turned up to be a place where bird colonies stay during the summer season.  Supply  Concrete dam of the reservoir Currently the reservoir supplies water for a 50% of the Basque Country. In the village of Ullíbarri-Gamboa they pump more than 800 l/s to provide to Vitoria-Gasteiz. Besides, there is a hydroelectric energy station, next to Vizcaya, which works with the help of this reservoir. Furthermore, it helps the Zadorra river not to alter its course when the water level is very high, it can evacuate 570 m³ per second.  Natural Parks  In this surroundings there are three natural parks: Garaio Provincial Park, Landa Provincial Park and Mendijur Ornithological Park.  Garaio Provincial Park  Ullíbarri-Gamboa reservoir at Garaio The Garaio Provincial Park is located next to the Zadorra river, forming a small peninsula. It has many forests that makes it easy to have a close bond with nature. It is accessible by car and has many ruts which can be done cycling or walking. However, it is next to Garaio, a village in which cottages can be rented and it offers a relaxing stay in the area.  Landa Provincial Park  The Landa Provincial Park is next to the village Landa, 17 km away from Vitoria-Gasteiz. It is on northeast of the reservoir and it offers a small beach to stay at. Most inhabitants from Vitoria come here on summer and the old railway tracks are now wide ways for bicycles.  Mendijur Ornithological Park  The Mendixur area is place where the surface water zone is impressive. It has 70 ha of extension and it is commonly frequented by people who like nature and would like to know more about the ecosystem of this place. Moreover, the animal that abound are the birds and depending on the season the type of birds go changing. It is a part of the net Natura 2000. In Euskal Herria, this passion for the birds has led to a new hobby called birding, which is popular in some other countries of Europe.

However, despite its Spanish synonym Camaraou noir has no relationship to the Portuguese wine grape Espadeiro that is used to make red Vinho Verde. The grape may have some relation to the Jurançon and Béarn wine grape Camaralet de Lasseube which is also known as Camaraou blanc but DNA analysis has shown that the two varieties are distinct and not color mutations of one or the other.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 179-180, Allen Lane 2012 History The Jurançon region located in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department where Camaraou noir has historically been grown. Ampelographers believe that the name Camaraou derives from the Béarnese word camarau which may have, in turn, be derived itself from the Gascon word cama that means \\"leg, trunk\\" and could be a reference to viticultural practice of growing grapevines up trees as trellising. Another possibility is that the name has some connection to the commune of Camalès located in the Hautes-Pyrénées department of southwestern France. A late 18th century document shows that a Camarau grape was growing in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department, French Basque Country and in the País Vasco region of northern Spain, however the description of this grapes seems to indicate that it was more likely the white Camaraou blanc (Camaralet de Lasseube) grape. The first mention that was definitively of Camaraou noir was in Viala & Vermorel catalogue of grape varieties produced from 1901-1910 by the French ampelographers Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel. Viticulture Historically Camaraou noir vines have been trained to grow up tree trunks for support. This is an old viticultural practice that dates back to Roman days but is still practices in some parts of the world such as in the Minho region (pictured) where Vinho Verde is produced. Camaraou noir is a late-ripening variety that can be very vigorous and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting. The vine tends to produce small berries but as part of very large, compact clusters that can be susceptible to various viticultural hazards like mildew. Traditionally Camaraou noir is trained up tree trunks, an ancient practice that dates back to Roman winemaking days. Wine regions While Camaraou noir is still a permitted variety in the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wines of Jurançon and Béarn, the vine is very rarely planted there. Today most of the world's Camaraou noir vines can be found in the northwestern Spanish wine region of Galicia where the grape is a permitted grape variety in the Denominación de Origen (DO) wines of Rías Baixas. Here the grape is known as Espadeiro and Caíño Redondo with a long history of being grown in the Pontevedra and Ourense provinces. In 2008, there were 137 hectares (339 acres) of Camaraou noir growing in Galicia where it was mostly blended with Mencía and Caíño tinto. Relationship to other grapes Due to similarities in synonyms, Camaraou noir is often confused for the Portuguese wine grape Espadeiro but DNA analysis in 2003 confirmed that the two varieties are separate and that most of the Espadeiro grown in Galicia, as well as another variety known as Caiño Redondo, were in fact Camaraou noir. DNA profiling has also clarified the relationship between Camaraou noir and Camaralet de Lasseube (also known as Camaraou blanc) showing the two varieties to be related but distinct and not color mutations. Both grapes appear to also related to the Jurançon grapes Ahumat, Arrouya noir and Penouille. Synonyms Over the years Camaraou noir has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Caiño Redondo, Camaralet noir, Camaran, Camaras, Camarau, Camaraue rouge, Gros noir, Moustardet and Sparse Menue.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Camaraou noir Accessed: April 20th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties Category:French wine Category:Spanish wine ","title":"Camaraou noir"},{"id":"39168435","text":"Estadio Oscar Ramos Cabieses is a municipal stadium in Lima, Peru opened in 1970.

The Tifon (Typhoon)-2A is based on the Soviet T-54/55 tank. The tanks is a 3 man machine with day and night technology and a thermal vision Buran devise with 12 km range. Development The Typhoon-2A project was designed by Sergio Casanave Quelopana, a Peruvian Engineer, to help the Peruvian Army keep up with modern tank designs. The design was built around the Peruvian T-55 using feedback from the Peruvian military, and available components in European tank designs. The engineers decided to use the experience of successful modern tank designs, such as the Russian T-90 and the French Leclerc. This was achieved by developing the Typhoon-2A through the Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau. The Typhoon-2A is the product of a series of modifications and modernisations of the T-55 AGM.  Features  Armament The Typhoon-2A is primarily armed with an auto-loaded 125 mm smooth-bore KBM-1M 48 caliber gun capable of 8 rpm. It can fire APFSDS-T rounds, tandem-charge HEAT rounds, and HE-FRAG rounds with an effective range up to 3,000 m. It also carries anti-tank guided missile with an effective range exceeding 5,000m, and is capable of targeting ground targets and helicopters flying at low altitude. Secondary armament is a remotely controlled 12.7×108mm KT-12.7 machine gun. The Typhoon-2A may also be fitted with a co-axial 7.62×54mmR KT-7.62 machine gun. Fire control on the Typhoon-2A 2 is a ballistics computer LIO-V operated by both the gunner and the commander. The Typhoon-2A can function at night using BURAN CATHERINE-E thermal vision with a range up to 12 km. Shielding and defenses The Typhoon-2A features Ceramic Shield \\"Deflek T\\", composed of a series of steel compound and polymer plates. T Deflek substantially reduces the initial velocity of APFSDS, and neutralizes HEAT charges fired by both tanks and antitank guns. Nozh Reactive armor, is composed of explosive charges, which are activated upon impact over 30 mm projectiles, neutralizing their penetrating effects. The Ceramic Shield \\"Deflekt\\" and Reactive Armor \\"Nozh\\" increased overall survivability Hollow Load missile type (HEAT) rocket antitank missiles or guns and sub- calibrated (APFSDS) 120mm caliber, in the field, it was found effective to \\"neutralize\\" the drilling of 120 mm caliber projectile type NATO APFSDS 2,000 m, as well as type-120 mm caliber HEAT NATO up to 3,000 m. Can then ensure that the capacity of ammunition piercing resistance has increased more than 5 times the smoke grenade original. Possesses twelve gauge 81 mm which are located on both sides of the tower, which are actuated by the control box Linkey-SPZ system, creating a smokescreen around the tank. Mechanics It has an engine of 1,050 HP 5TDFMA model is two stroke, turbocharged and flex-(Kerosene, oil, diesel, jet fuel or a mixture), five-cylinder boxer horizontal type, have an ejection system for the ventilation system motor, shutter system allows the tank to immerse in the water. The 1.8m ventilation liquid type, closed, forced, uses the exhaust gas system of high motor. The purification system efficiency cyclone-type air cassette provides a 99.8% efficiency. Operation for more than 500 km without cleaning the transmission box filter. The planetary system consisting of two plates with six changes forward and three reverse, using a mechanical-electrical-system ensures maximum speed up to 75 km/h at front, and up to 32 km/h backward. The Typhoon-2A has a new type driving system \\"power steering\\", presenting data is an indicator of changes in digital display; ignition electric system and pressure. The alternative for removing a suspension and bearing system is newly designed, using 3 rollers per side, torsion bars, and high strength springs, which allow increasing road speed up 60 km/h up to 78 km/h on the road, and greater than 45 km/h in reverse, also counting for this new \\"Neoprene Pads\\" to allow a better grip in the road.

Life Thomas Stuart Smith was born in 1815 as the secret illegitimate nephew of Alexander Smith, who had the estate at Glassingall, Dunblane, Scotland. Alexander's brother, the father, sent Thomas to a school in France whilst he conducted his business in Canada and the East Indies. In 1831 no fees were paid and Thomas thought his father must have died. He returned to England, when he and his uncle learned of each other for the first time. They did not meet, but Alexander advanced sums to him from time to time. Smith started working as a tutor. He later became interested in painting from an Italian master painter whom he met whilst serving as a traveling tutor to a British family. His uncle Alexander supplied funding so that he could travel and paint in Italy starting in 1840. By the end of that decade, Smith was having his work accepted by both the Salon des Beaux Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy in London. His first painting at the Royal Academy was bought by Professor Owen, an acquaintance of Edwin Landseer, who was said to have admired it repeatedly. Inheritance The Pipe of Freedom, 1869, Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum In 1849 Alexander Smith died intestate. Thomas took possession of the family's estate in 1857 after vying at great expense with eighteen other aspirants. During the eight years that he had waited in hope of his inheritance, he taught art at the Nottingham School of Design. James Orrock, the collecter and watercoulourist, was one of his pupils; he commented on how Smith could paint anything. Smith was known to the Barbizon School of realistic painting, including the animal painters Constant Troyon and John Phillip RA. Having gained the estate, he kept it just six years. He sold it and used the funds to move to London. His legal costs had been high. His new fortune enabled him to create an art collection at a studio in Fitzroy Square that included his own work. He decided to create an Institute in Stirling to house his new collection. He drew up plans for a library, museum, and a reading room and he offered £5,000 to the council if they could donate a site within two years. He signed the trust into existence in November 1869 with himself, James Barty, the Provost of Stirling and A.W.Cox, a fellow artist, as trustees. He did not see his plans fulfilled as he died the next month in Avignon. Legacy Smith is known primarily for founding the Smith Institute, which is now called the Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery. Smith also has hundreds of paintings in public ownership. Two of Smith's works that are still thought to be important are portraits he painted of black men. Unlike other depictions at the time, in which black people were included as servants, Smith's portraits Fellah of Kinneh and The Pipe of Freedom show his subjects as independent and free; they were painted to celebrate the abolition of slavery in America in 1865 following the American Civil War. He also did a smaller painting called The Cuban Cigarette, which has a similar presence. The Pipe of Freedom shows a man lighting a pipe; behind him a slave sale notice has been partially covered by an abolition notice.Pipe of Freedom, Thomas Stuart Smith, accessed April 2013 References Category:1815 births Category:1869 deaths Category:Scottish philanthropists Category:19th-century Scottish painters Category:Scottish male painters Category:Scottish abolitionists Category:19th-century philanthropists ","title":"Thomas Stuart Smith"},{"id":"39168590","text":"The Fulton–Mock–Blackmer House is a historic home built in 1820 in Salisbury, North Carolina, USA, whose most famous resident was the actor Sidney Blackmer. It burned in 1984 but a restoration was completed in 2015. It is located in the West Square Historic District, a local historic district designated by the city in 1975, and is a contributing structure to the Salisbury Historic District. John Fulton, for whom Fulton Street was named, built the Federalist style house in Salisbury in 1820. An ad in the January 1, 1821 Western Carolinian said, \\"The subscriber is now finishing a large and commodious house in this place, on the western side of the town, situated between the Male and Female Academies, which he intends as a boarding-house for young ladies.\\" Fulton died in 1827 and his stepson Maxwell Chambers inherited the property. President Andrew Jackson appointed Fulton's nephew William S. Fulton governor of Arkansas. Girls who attended Salisbury Academy lived in the house, and later the house became a school. Davidson College owned the house at one time. The A.J. Mock family owned the house and added Italianate brackets above the front windows. They also replaced original Federal style windows, of which one remained. Actor Sidney Blackmer bought the house in 1931 and the family lived there. Blackmer planted cedar trees, a holly tree and a cucumber magnolia. The 5000-square-foot house at Fulton and Innes Streets sat vacant after a December 1, 1984 fire, after which Suzanne Blackmer could not afford a restoration. Four ionic columns added between 1906 and 1908 were stored, though contractor Al Wilson left the base of one as a guide in case the columns were put back. Wilson also fixed the roof and foundation in 1989, actions credited with keeping the house from falling down during years of neglect. In 2008, Jonathan Blackmer, son of Sidney and Suzanne, asked that the house either be torn down or restored for \\"any public use\\", such as a museum devoted to his father's career. In June 2012, Historic Salisbury Foundation, which had done some work on the house over the years, agreed to buy it, paying $109,611 to Jonathan Blackmer. Renovation was under way, and in April 2013, the public was allowed inside the house for the first time in 28 years. Architect Joseph K. Oppermann pointed out its \\"Federal-style windows and shutters, false wood graining on doors and early wallpaper.\\" Blue wallpaper with the photo of Commodore Stephen Decatur was found in the front parlor. Brian Davis, Historic Salisbury Foundation executive director, said the roof would be raised to where it was originally, restoring a full attic. Materials from the historic Grimes Mill, which burned in 2013, were to be used in the house. Fulton-Mock-Blackmer House in 2015 after completion of the renovation. Fulton-Mock-Blackmer House after completed renovations. Glenn and Beth Dixon previously restored one house on South Ellis Street and wanted to move back to the West Square Historic District. To encourage her husband to restore a home she liked, Beth Dixon asked to look at other houses. One of those was the Fulton–Mock–Blackmer House, which she thought her husband would think was too far gone. Instead, since the foundation had done so much work, Glenn Dixon said, \\"Oh, no, this is perfect.\\" He actually wanted a house where everything would be new except the basic structure. In February 2014, the Dixons bought the house from the Historic Salisbury Foundation for $150,000. Historic preservation tax credits helped the Dixons with the restoration, scheduled to be completed by December 2014. The chimneys were replaced, but their old bricks were used as a facade. Otherwise, the couple planned to keep as much of the house's history as possible. The restored 20-foot columns were returned July 14 but still needed capitals. Old photos and Jonathan Blackmer's memories helped determine what needed to be done. As much as possible, each section of the house would look as it had at some point in its history. Glenn Dixon said, \\"Historically, it's 100 percent original.\\" Interior doors dating to 1820 are still in use. Renovation was completed in early 2015. The Fulton–Mock–Blackmer House won a 2015 historic preservation award from Historic Salisbury Foundation, in the category Private Preservation & Neighborhood Revitalization.

In addition to a career with the London University School of Slavonic Studies, she was course director of the Joint Services School for Linguists (JSSL), a UK Government training programme to produce linguists and interpreters of Russian, for military and intelligence purposes.Anthony Cross, ‘Hill, Dame Elizabeth Mary (1900–1996)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 April 2013Dame Elizabeth (Mary)\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2012; online edn, November 2012; accessed 28 December 2016. Background Hill was born on 24 October 1900 in St Petersburg, the fifth of six children (and second of the three daughters) of Frederick William Hill (1860–1924), and his wife, born Luise Sophie Olga Wilhelmine Müller (1862-1928). Her father was a businessman: members of the English Hill family had been trading with Russia since the middle of the eighteenth century. Her mother was a product of the large German-speaking community in Russia. The family had fled the Bolsheviks in 1917 in fear for their lives. Elizabeth celebrated her seventeenth birthday on the ship that carried them away. They relocated to London where they found themselves suddenly all but destitute. Career Often known as \\"Lisa\\", Hill worked in several language teaching jobs before entering University College London, where she gained a First-class degree in Russian in 1924 and a PhD in 1931. Her first university appointment came in 1936, when she succeeded A.F.Goody as university lecturer in Slavonic studies at Cambridge. According to her \\"Who's Who\\" entry, she was a \\"Ministry of Information Slavonic Specialist during [the] War of 1939-45\\" Hill trained military recruits in Russian. A fellow of Girton College, in 1948, she became the first Professor of Slavonic Studies at the University of Cambridge. She held this position until 1968. Personal life In 1984, Hill married Stojan Veljkovic, described by one source as a \\"Serbian aristocrat\\", but the marriage was dissolved in 1995, shortly before she died. Hill was noted for her 'capacity for long-standing friendships', especially with Doris Mudie, whom Hill first met in the late 1920s in London. In 1936, when Hill had gained her first lectureship, Mudie was reportedly 'penniless' and had suffered the first in a series of nervous breakdowns.Elliott & Shukman, pp. 17-18 Further reading * Elliott, Geoffrey, & Shukman, Harold.

In 1968 he was elected to lead the parent campaign against the closure of Holtane school in Kragerø, where his youngest daughter was to begin. He claimed that the closure was in violation of the law, acquired a typewriter and sent many letters to the newspapers. Three years after the parental action campaign, a dispute with his wife concluded in his forced hospitalization in psychiatric care 22 November 1971. He was diagnosed with \\"Paranoia 297.0, Religious quarrelsome type\\" and was forcibly medicated with drugs Trilafon, Akineton and Peragit. With this he began a struggle against psychiatry, which cost him his job, property and family. On 11 August 1995 Arnold Juklerød received an unconditional admission from the Ministry of Education and Research that his \\"delusions\\" in the Holtane case had been correct. Juklerød received considerable media attention, and it is claimed that his involvement has led to reforms in psychiatry (in Norway). When Arnold Juklerød was discharged in 1985, he refused to leave the hospital area, because his diagnosis \\"incurable and severely mentally ill\\" was not annulled. Until his death, he stayed in the hospital area in a tent and barracks, as a protest against Norwegian psychiatry. Juklerød-case aftermath Symptom-free sickness (1988) It is claimed that Arnold Juklerød was healthy before his forced hospitalization. A commission that was appointed in 1988 claimed that in the worst case he suffered from an \\"insanity without symptoms.\\" The behavioural therapist Arild Karlsen commented on this diagnosis as follows: \\"The 06/20/88 there emerged a straight psychiatric declaration in the Oslo Magistrates Court. It was signed by the psychiatrist and the police doctor Karl-Ewert Hornman and psychiatrist and physician Njål Madland. The third psychiatrist who took payment for participating in the judicial observation, Chief doctor Harald E. Reppesgård , never got the declaration for signature. \\" A new commission of investigation was demanded (1996) On the 7 September 1995 attorney Knut Rognlien wrote in a press release: On 14 March 1996 Erling Folkvord from the Red Electoral Alliance presented a private proposal to the Stortinget (Parliament) to appoint a commission of inquiry of the Juklerød case. In the report from the Parliamentary Committee on Justice of 9 May 1996 Proposition 186 (1995–96), according to the preamble: 92 of Stortinget's 165 members voted on the proposal on 31 May 1996. The proposal was defeated by 86 votes to six. Those who voted for an investigation, other than Erling Folkvord, was Børre Rønningen (Socialist Left Party), John D. Gløtvold (the Center Party), John Dale (the Center Party), Kjell Engebretsen (The Norwegian Labour Party) and Trond Mathisen (The Norwegian Labour Party). Rapporteur was Jan Simonsen from the Progress Party. The majority's justification to outvote the proposal was, according to Simonsen, that in 1995, there were 725 applications for compensation ex gratia (\\"Billighetserstatning\\") from people who \\"feel unreasonably treated by the public service\\" and that they couldn't \\"pick out a single case of one individual\\". Juklerød case files made public (2002) On 28 February 2002, a critic of Norwegian psychiatry was reported to the police by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority's president Georg Apenes, for posting Juklerød's medical records on the Internet, something which was desired by the deceased. The journal was published on 25 January 2002, the sixth anniversary of Juklerød's death, and led to police raid and seizure of computer equipment. On 8 November 2005, a bust of Arnold Juklerød was erected at the Gaustad Hospital.Det Kongelige Kirke-, Utdannings- og Forskningsdepartement: Nedleggelse av Holtane skolekrets, undertegnet ekspedisjonssjef Hanna Marit Jahr og underdirektør Carolyn Midsem, saksbehandler Else-Brit Nilsen, Refnr 93/5817GrR ebn, 11.

It existed from 1871 to 1874, with Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau as king. History The Kingdom of Fiji was the first unified Fijian state, and it covered all of modern Fiji, except the island of Rotuma. Cakobau was the Vunivalu (Warlord or Paramount Chief) of the island of Bau. His father, Tanoa Visawaqa, had conquered the Burebasaga Confederacy but never subdued western Fiji. Cakobau controlled most of the eastern parts of the Fijian Islands and declared himself King of Fiji (Self proclaim Tui Viti). This met with opposition from other chiefs, who regarded him as at best first among equals. However, in June 1871, John Bates Thurston, the British honorary consul, persuaded the Fijian chiefs to accept a constitutional monarchy with Cakobau as king, but with real power in the hands of a cabinet and legislature dominated by Australian settlers. The Legislative Assembly met for the first time in Levuka in November 1871. Within months, government overspending had led to the accumulation of unmanageable debt. In 1872, following continuing economic and social unrest, Thurston approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with an offer to cede the islands. Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation. The question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, Maʻafu, with both men vacillating for many months. On 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the British accepted. On 23 September, Sir Hercules Robinson, soon to be appointed the British Governor, arrived on HMS Dido and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his Tui Viti title. On 10 October 1874, Cakobau, Ma'afu, and a group of some senior Chiefs of Fiji signed two copies of a Deed of Cession establishing the Colony of Fiji, which lasted for almost a century.

He co-founded Edwin Shirley Trucking (later abbreviated to EST) in 1974, which became one of the largest music transport companies in Europe. He went on to convert old bonded warehouses in the east end of London into the successful film and television recording studio, Three Mills Island Studios. In his later life he returned to the transport business, particularly for theatre companies and other parts of the entertainment industry. Early life Edwin Antoine Shirley was born in Cranbrook, Kent on 16 October 1948 to Herbert Shirley and Marie Gates. He was educated at Cranbrook School, and then St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he took a BA in Modern Languages (specialising in French and German). He was involved in numerous undergraduate stage productions as an actor and director. He also acted in a number of plays with the National Youth Theatre. Edwin Shirley Trucking Shirley's language skills and knowledge of theatre lighting and sound led him into jobs on tour with the Rolling Stones and other prominent bands of the 1970s. After working on numerous Rock and Roll tours, he established Edwin Shirley Trucking with Roy Lamb. The company was run from his family farm in Kent, and later expanded into premises in East London. Edwin Shirley Trucking became indelibly associated with live music tours. In an obituary on Planet Rock Radio, Bernard Doherty referred to the apocryphal notion that \\"You haven't really made it until Edwin Shirley is moving your gear around\\". Brian May of Queen, noted Shirley's importance to their touring operation: \\"Edwin was at the head of Queen's vehicle convoy for so many years I can't begin to remember how many... He was a great pal of Gerry Stickells, our illustrious Tour Manager and the two of them wrote the book on how to party on tour.\\" Edwin Shirley Staging Having built a successful trucking company, Shirley started a new company Edwin Shirley Staging which built stages for a number of large concerts including Live Aid in 1985. Shirley left both companies in the 1990s. Three Mills Island Studios While looking for rehearsal space in East London, Shirley viewed Three Mills Island, and realised the potential to develop a film studio there. After meeting with Peter Bazalgette, Shirley secured the site as the location for the first Big Brother reality TV programme, which went on to become a major domestic television series. The studio proved a success, but a dispute with the landlord led to the site being taken over by another company. As of 2013, the studio is still operating. Death Having suffered from bowel cancer since 2009, Shirley had undergone effective surgery and carried on working for four years. On 14 April 2013 Shirley was hospitalised due to a massive bleed, and after two days in Homerton Hospital, Hackney, died on 16 April 2013.

Flown near the end of the war, it was not selected for production. Design and development The Wib 1 was an aerodynamically clean single bay biplane, with square ended, constant chord unswept wings, mounted with slight stagger and braced with pairs of parallel interplane struts assisted by wires. It had short span, broad chord ailerons only on the lower wings. The fabric covered wings were metal framed like the rest of the aircraft. There was a rounded central cut- out in the trailing edge of the upper wing, under which the pilot sat in his open cockpit. The fuselage was rounded in cross-section and covered with light alloys panels over the engine and forward part, with fabric covering behind. A roughly elliptical plan, braced tailplane was attached to the top of the fuselage and carried split elevators with curved trailing edges. The fin was short and small but the rudder was broad in chord and extended down between the elevators to the keel; both fin and rudder had rounded edges. The Wib 1 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8B, a water-cooled, upright V8 engine. This was neatly housed under a smooth curved cowling behind a large, domed spinner and drove a two blade propeller. A pair of synchronised Vickers machine guns fired through the propeller arc. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with the mainwheels on a rigid axle attached to the lower fuselage by a pair of faired V-struts, together with a small tailskid. The prototype flew for the first time early in November 1918, right at the end of World War I. The C1 designation was standard French military terminology for Chasseur (fighter), single seat. It went for official testing, in the hope of winning an Aviation Militaire contract, on 12 February 1919 and turned out to be fast, despite its relatively low engine power, because of its light construction and clean design. Though faster, it had a lower climb rate than its competitor, the Nieuport 29 with its Hispano-Suiza 8 F engine and was heavier on the controls. The Nieuport was preferred for the contract and development of the Wib 1 ended.

He was a student of Syed Nazir Husain Dehlawi and one of the founders of the Jamaat Ahl-i Hadith alongside him and Siddiq Hasan Khan Batalvi was the editor of the magazine Isha'atus Sunnah and is best known for being a major antagonist to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement..Mir Qasim Ali, Batalvi ka Anjam, 1931 Early life Muhammad Hussain Batalvi was born around 1840. His father, Sheikh Rahim Bakhsh, was an apothecary. In his childhood, he received elementary education, from Molvi Gul Ali Shah, a Shia, these were the times when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad also attended the same teacher. The two were to become lifelong friends, but intellectual foes.A R Dard, The Life of Ahmad, (1948) p. 36 He received further religious education from Abdullah Ghaznavi at Amritsar, before proceeding to Delhi where he studied Hadith, logic and grammar from Syed Nazir Husain. Biography of Batalvi, Fadl Hussain, Akbari Press, Agra, 1908.pp. 81, 307). After completing his religious studies, he returned to Batala in 1868. [Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya] Part IV, p.520, Ruhani Khazain Vol-01, page 621]Life of Ahmad, by A R Dard (1948) p. 54 Muhammad Hussain married twice, he had seven sons and three daughters.The Life of Ahmad, by A R Dard, page. 368.(1948). Literary career In 1878 he started publishing the magazine Isha‘atus Sunnah. It was a voice of the Ahle Hadith movement in the Punjab of the time. The magazine became quite popular and was recognized by notable scholars and Government Officials. When Sir Charles Umpherston Aitchison, Governor of the Punjab from 1882-1887,List of Governors Punjab left the area in April 1887, he gave Muhammad Hussain, a certificate testifying to his ability and learning. Muhammad Hussain proudly records this fact.[See ‘ Isha‘atus Sunnah’ Vol. 20, No. 3 ] The term Ahle-Hadith The Punjab had been a seat of violent insurgent activities by the Wahhabis for about fifty years from 1830 till 1880. The government had to send twenty expeditions to subdue the Wahhabi movement.\\"The great Wahabi Movement covered a period of over 50 years and was spread from the North-West Frontier to Bengal and Bihar. It was not an ephemeral or sudden upheaval: without any definite aim or organization, like the Revolt of 1857. The movement continued well over forty years after the death of its leader Saiyid Ahmed in 1831. The British sent over twenty expeditions before they were able to crush the movement. Important leaders of the movement-Yahya Ali, Ahmadullah, Amiruddin, Ibrahim Mandal, Rafique Mandal and their comrades were tried at the state trials of Ambala (1864), Patna (1865), Malda (Sept. 1870) and Rajmahal (October 1870), convicted and transported for life.\\" . The term Wahhabi had assumed a rather derogatory connotation in India and in the later parts of the Nineteenth Century. Wahhabism had been associated with militant insurgency in the Punjab and North West Frontier of British India. It was in this context that Batalvi requested that they be 'un-linked' from an unwanted impression of being Wahhabis. Batalvi wrote an application to the then Viceroy of India Robert Bulwer- Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton that they be called Ahl-e-Hadith rather than Wahhabi, which was granted on 19 January 1887.Magazine Isha'at-as-Sunnah, (محمد حسين بٹالوي، اشاعۃ السنۃ،ص:47، لاہور،ج:11,شمارہ،2) Views on Jihad Batalvi advocated \\"to wield the pen\\" rather than resorting to the use of force and militant means, He wrote: > Some of our Muslim brothers believe that the present misfortunes of the > followers of Islam cannot be removed without the sword. It is no use > acquiring worldly education. However, looking at the present condition of > the Muslims, this belief appears improbable.\\"...\\"Brethren! the age of the > sword is no more.

In such a useless and > weak condition, to consider them as a nation is to exceed the imagination of > Shaikh Chilli [a proverbial, comical figure in Urdu fiction].Isha'at-as- > Sunnah, vol. vi, no. 12, December 1883, p. 364 In his book, Iqtisaad-fi-Massaiil-Jihad Molvi Muhammad Hussain wrote: \\"It is haram [prohibited] to wage Jihad against the British.\\"Jihad is prohibited for the Muslims in the British territories, \\"Iqtisaad-fi-Massaiil-Jihad\\" pp: 47-50 Verdict about Jihad Hostility to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who later claimed to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi in Ahmediyya, was a lifelong friend of Muhammad Hussain Batalvi. They had been attending the same teacher in childhood. Batalvi's father Sheikh Rahim Bakhsh also used to visit Qadian.Life of Ahmad, by A R Dard (1948) p.77 When Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote his magnum opus, the Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya, Batalvi wrote a very favourable review upon it, covering a good two hundred pages, being serially published in his magazine. Muhammad Hussain Batalvi wrote: > In our opinion, from the point of view of the modern age, this book stands > unique in the history of Islam. No book has ever been published like it in > the past, and we cannot say anything about the future, which is known only > to God. The perseverance of the author in the service of Islam, through his > life, his energy, pen, tongue, and every form of activity is almost > unprecedented amongst Muslims. This should not be taken as Asiatic > exaggeration. We challenge anyone to show us the like of this > book.[Isha‘atus-Sunnah (vol. 6, Nos. 6-11)] Batalvi's opinion of Ahmad changed in 1891, when Ahmad published his various spiritual claims and declared that Jesus son of Mary had died his natural death and the Second Coming was a metaphor, referring only to the coming of a disciple of Muhammad who would be appointed to the spiritual station of Messiah. This prophecy, he claimed, had fulfilled in his very own person. This marked the end of a lifelong friendship and Batalvi turned into an arch enemy of Ahmad and his Ahmadiyya Community in his later life. On 31 January 1891, Muhammad Hussain Batalvi wrote a letter to Ahmad asking him whether Ahmad had really claimed to be the promised Messiah. Ahmad thought it sufficient to write only \\"Yes\\" in answer. Because Muhammad Hussain had asked him to say \\"Yes or No\\".Ahmad’s reply is dated 5 February 1891. (Isha‘atus Sunnah, Vol. 12, No.12).Maktobaat e Ahmad, Vol-1, P.311 (Letter no.5) (2008) In his later life Muhammad Hussain Batalvi took it for his life-mission to undo whatever Ahmad intended to do. He organised a Fatwa [religious verdict] signed by hundreds of Ulema religious scholars that Ahmad was an unbeliever, or kafir.Fatwas were published all over the country excommunicating him and declaring him to be an infidel. He was called Dajjal, Mulhid,Zindiq, Makkar, Mal‘un, etc. [Life of Morning, by A R Dard, (1948) p.371] He wrote about his former friend in his magazine Isha’t-us-Sunnah; that Ahmad was a \\"raving drunkard, intriguer, swindler, accursed, the one-eyed Dajjal, slave of silver and gold, whose revelation is nothing but a seminal discharge, shameless, the ring-leader of sweepers and street vagabonds, dacoit, murderer, whose followers are scoundrels, villains, adulterers, and drunkards.\\"Bhangar, makkar, fareibi, mal‘un, a‘war dajjal, abdud-darahim waddananir, jiska ilham ihtilam hai, bei- haya, bhangiyun aur bazari shuhdun ka sargaruh, daku, khunreiz, jis ki jama‘at badma‘sh, badkirdar, zani, sharabi [original] in Ishat-us-Suna, Vol. 16.

We would have at once cut off your head with a sword and made you a dead body\\".Isha'at-us-Sunnah, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 95 In the alleged murder lawsuitLaw Suit by H M Clark against Ghulam Ahmad, instituted by Henry Martyn Clark in the Court of District Magistrate Captain Montagu William Douglas Muhammad Hussain Batalvi, appeared on the side of the prosecution, and sided with Dr Clark of the Church Mission Society against Ghulam AhmadLife of Ahmad, A R Dard (1948), P. 553 Batalvi also accused Ghulam Ahmad of sedition and rebellious intentions towards the British Government, likening him to the Mahdi of Sudan and warning the Government in the following words: It is not possible to write about Muhammad Hussain Batalvi, without mentioning his lifelong struggle against the Ahmadiyya Movement of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Batalvi remained his major antagonist throughout his life. The Ahmadiyya missionary Abdul Rahim Dard who wrote the Life of Ahmad (1948) has termed him as the 'Caiaphas' of the latter days.The Life of Ahmad, by A R Dard. (1948) p.559 The Ludhiana debate This debate is known as the \\"Ludhiana Debate\\". It took place between Molvi Muhammad Hussain Batalvi and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, lasting for twelve days, from 20 July – 31 July 1891.The venue was the ‘Masjid Awanan’ (Awana's Mosque) at Ludhiana. As stated above, the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be the Promised Messiah and declaring the death of Jesus son of Mary, had very much perturbed Muhammad Hussain Batalvi. A lengthy correspondence between the two, finally led to an agreement upon holding a debate, on the basic issue or dispute: i.e. If Jesus son Mary had died a mortal death OR was yet alive (to descend in the Latter- days End time). It was also agreed upon, that the debate had to be in the form of written papers, no oral argument or discussion will be allowed. It will be held in ongoing sessions, in the presence of the audience and judges. The papers would be read out and handed over to the other party for writing of a rebuttal. The debate lasted for twelve long days, and was attended by about 300 persons, including the local gentry and dignitaries like the editors of the Punjab Gazette, Sialkot, and the Nur Afshan, Ludhiana. Kh. Ahsan Shah, Hon. Magistrate of the town; M. Miran Bakhsh, accountant; Shahzada Abdul Majid, Dr. Mustafa Ali, Kh.Muhammad Sattar Shah, Kh. Abdul Qadir, Master Charagh Din, Munshi Muhammad Qasim, Master Qadir Bakhsh, and Miyan Shair Muhammad Khan.The Life of Ahmad, by A R Dard, (1948) Page: 274] The sessions were presided over by independent Judges. The issue of the life and death of Jesus did not come under discussion at all. The whole time was consumed by settling down the relative authority of the Hadith and the Qur'an. Molvi Muhammad Hussain wanted the status of Hadith to be clarified first, before taking up the real subject of the debate. The debate appeared to have reached a dead end on 31 July 1891. The written papers of both sides were later published by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as Al-Haq Mubahathah Ludhiana (Urdu).

Muhammad Hussain Batalvi, used to say [as he] had raised Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to the status of a Saint and ‘Wali’ by attesting to his Revelations (Divine Converse); and by writing a ‘Review’ over his Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya, in the Isha’at-us-Sunnah; and had thus raised him in the eyes of the masses, so now he was under obligation to bring Ahmad down for his fresh claims.Isha’at-us- Sunnah, Vol-13, No.1, page. 4 He had challenged Ahmad to Mubahala: :::'If you are a man and have any courage, then prove both your claims in an assembly of learned men—you will not come into the field—I challenge you to a Mubahala. Come out into the field of Mubahala and take an oath'. Isha’at-us-Sunnah, Vol. 14, No. 12 p. 338 He had prophesied punishment and destruction for Ahmad when he said: :::'Otherwise He [God] would send down the severest punishment upon you and drive you to destruction'Isha’at-us-Sunnah, Vol. 15, No. 1, p. 15. and also Vol 18, No. 7, p. 215 Mirza Ghulam Ahmad asked Batalvi's permission to publish his ‘Revelations’ [Divine Converse] about Batalvi's tragic end[Letter of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad dated 31 December 1892] Muhammad Hussain Batalvi happily granted this permission.Permission to Publish any prophecy, [\\"Isha‘atus Sunnah Vol. 15, No. 8. p. 170.] Mirza Ghulam Ahmad predicted: :::اے پے تکفیر ما بستہ کمر، خا نہ ات ویران تودر فکردگر [Transcription-Persian: Aye paye takfeer e ma bastha kamar, khana ath veeran too dar fikre digar] :::'O thou, who hast girded up thy loins to have me declared an infidel, thine own house is desolate and ruined and thou art thinking of something else.'Book: ‘Zia ul Haq’ (The Light of Truth), by Ahmad, P. 46 (1895)[Ruhani Khazain, Vol 9, page 309 .

She was the first woman to run a daily newspaper in the United States (the Stockton Daily Leader, 1874), and the second female lawyer admitted to practice in California. As an activist, Gordon was a key proponent of the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which allowed women to practice law in California. She also pushed for the inclusion of a section in the California Constitution that prohibited the state from barring women from practicing any profession. Early life Laura de Force Gordon (née Laura de Force) was born in North East, Pennsylvania, on August 17, 1838, to Abram de Force and Catherine Doolittle Allen. The family had nine children. Her father struggled with rheumatism, but the children (including at least two daughters) received education in the public schools. After the death of one of the children, the family turned to Spiritualism in 1855. Gordon toured the Northeast of the United States giving public speeches, starting as young as 15, including a speech in Boston at age 18. During one such event, she met a Scottish physician named Charles H. Gordon, and married him in 1862. They moved west gradually, first to New Orleans (where he was posted during the Civil War), then to Nevada, and finally settling in California in 1870. Before 1878, she divorced her husband on grounds of adultery. She later referred to herself frequently as a widow, rather than a divorcée, since widowhood was \\"a more acceptable explanation ... for ... lack of male protection\\".  Journalism  Portrait from the official publication of her speech at the Columbian Exposition in 1892.In 1873, Gordon became an editor and reporter for the Stockton Narrow Gauge. In 1874, she bought the Stockton Weekly Leader and converted into a daily newspaper, becoming the first female publisher of a paper in the United States. Between 1876 and 1878, she published the Oakland Daily Democrat. During that period, she also served as a correspondent for the Sacramento Bee and other papers, with a press desk on the floor of the state Assembly. She also served as an organizer of the Pacific Coast Press Association.  Suffrage activism  San Francisco Daily Alta for a talk on suffrage given by Gordon in 1870. In the late 1860s, Gordon's speaking career turned from Spiritualism to women's rights, perhaps influenced by Spiritualism's emphasis on egalitarianism and equality between the sexes. Gordon's February 19, 1868 speech in San Francisco, titled \\"The Elective Franchise: Who Shall Vote\\", was the first in California on the suffrage movement. It attracted a healthy crowd, some of whom went on to become leaders in California's suffrage movement. In 1870, she helped found the California Women's Suffrage Society, and gave more than 100 speeches on suffrage. Gordon also worked for suffrage in Nevada, speaking throughout the state in the late 1860s and in front of the state legislature in 1871. One paper writing about her speaking at this time described her speaking as \\"like a stream of liquid fire\\". Gordon also traveled outside of the Southwest, representing California at the 1872 National Woman Suffrage Association in New York City. At the 1872 Liberal Republican convention, alongside Susan B. Anthony, she asked the party to seat her as a representative from California (to \\"laughter\\") and submitted a pro-suffrage resolution. After beginning her legal career in 1879, she continued her suffrage activism. She was elected president of the California State Suffrage Association from 1884–1894, and a paid speaker on behalf of the movement in the 1888 presidential election. In 1892, she spoke at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Gordon was considered part of the \\"radical\\" branch of women's suffrage activists, in part because of her divorce and association with Spiritualism. Her correspondents included Henry George and Susan B. Anthony. Legal activism and career As a result of her suffrage and publishing work, Gordon was well known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned her, along with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage the lobbying campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878. Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the debate to stay in touch with lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature. Later in 1878, Gordon was nominated as a delegate to the California Constitutional Convention, but was defeated. Despite not being elected as a delegate, during the convention, in February 1879, Gordon and Foltz successfully pushed for the inclusion of Article XX, Section 18, of the Constitution. This clause prohibited state law from barring women from entering any \\"lawful business, avocation, or profession\\". At around the same time, in January 1879, Gordon and Foltz were briefly admitted to the recently opened Hastings College of the Law, and paid the $10 tuition. However, on the third day of classes, they were asked to leave, in part because the school's Dean felt their \\"rustling skirts\\" bothered the male students. In February, the women filed and argued a case that persuaded the state's Supreme Court to overturn that decision. However, because of work, activism, and family obligations, neither Gordon nor Foltz were able to graduate, and so the first graduate of Hastings was Mary McHenry Keith. At that time, law school graduation was not necessary for bar admission, so Gordon studied on her own. On December 6, 1879, she was admitted to the State Bar of California, becoming the second female attorney in the state (after Foltz). In 1880 she established her own firm in San Francisco, where she specialized in general and criminal law. Her work included successful defenses in several murder cases. She was also the first woman in California to argue a case to a jury. This work attracted national attention, particularly in the case of George Wheeler, where Gordon assisted the defense and Foltz the prosecution, leading New York's National Police Gazette to write that it was a case where \\"two females will be allowed to wag their tongues to their heart's content\\". On February 3, 1883, Gordon became the second woman to be admitted to the bar of the United States Supreme Court, after Belva Lockwood. Later life and death Gordon retired from the legal profession in 1901, and spent her last years on her farm in Lodi, California. Her health deteriorated in 1906 after the premature death of her grandchild. She caught pneumonia in March 1907, and died in Lodi on April 5, 1907. Modern speculation about sexual orientation In May 1879, Gordon left a copy of her pamphlet The Great Geysers of California and How to Reach Them in a time capsule buried in San Francisco's Washington Square park. Gordon wrote inside the flyleaf: Gordon's inscription was read aloud in public after the time capsule was opened in April 1979. Armistead Maupin, who was present when the time capsule was opened, speculated that the quotation's use of \\"lover of her own sex\\" could have been a \\"coming out\\" for Gordon, but also acknowledged the phrase could have been an \\"idiosyncrasy of 19th century speech\\". The quotation was later used in Randy Shilts' biography of gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, \\"Mayor of Castro Street\\".

It is typically a sort of non-denominational, evangelical Protestant church. Because Bible Churches are typically non- denominational, there is no unifying doctrine among these churches. Each Bible Church is independent and is therefore not committed to any particular catechism or Statement of Faith aside from their own. Nevertheless, many Bible Churches hold to a few commonalities. Most Bible Churches are elder rule, or under a type of presbyterian polity (not to be confused with Presbyterianism) as opposed to episcopal polity or congregationalist polity. This means that a board of elders, either elected by the congregation or appointed by the church staff, governs the local body rather than the congregation ruling itself, or a single pastor/bishop governing the body. In general, Bible Churches are committed to expository preaching, often by teaching verse-by-verse through an entire book of the Bible. This practice, fueled by the belief that the Bible is inerrant, God-breathed, and sufficient (born from the Reformation teaching of Sola Scriptura), is central to the essence of most Bible Churches, and is the source of their name. Bible Churches almost universally hold to the doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone in Christ Alone, which is also born out of the Reformation (Sola fide). See also: Five solae In addition, many, though not all, Bible Churches are premillennial dispensationalists, as the Bible Church movement has largely been attributed to Dallas Theological Seminary, which is a leading dispensationalist institution.

It is white, with a series of about 10 rufous spots near the suture. The five whorls form a conical spire. They are ventricose, with delicate, highly elevated spiral rib-striae,- of which there are about 5 on the upper and 10 on the last whorl. The surface of the ribs is slightly tuberculous, and the last one overhangs the succeeding whorl so as to form a broad deep channel at the suture. The interspaces have about the same width as the ribs, and are beautifully barred with close-set laminae. The base of the shell isconvex, with a small deep scalariform umbilicus, sculptured like the spire. The aperture is obliquely semicircular. The outer lip is crenulated by the ribs, and conspicuously sulcate within. The columella is sharp, oblique, armed with a fully developed sharp tooth at the base, succeeded by a deep basal notch.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (described as Euchelus instrictus) Distribution This marine species occurs off Japan, the Philippines, New Caledonia and Fiji References External links * To Encyclopedia of Life * To World Register of Marine Species * instrictum Category:Gastropods described in 1849 ","title":"Herpetopoma instrictum"},{"id":"39169200","text":"Herpetopoma lischkei is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chilodontidae.Bouchet, P.

The nucleus is wanting, remaining five, slightly convex whorls with a narrow canaliculate suture. The first whorl has rather distant ribs. The next whorls have 3 spiral lirae (fine linear elevations) and radiating ribs. The last 3 whorls contain 5 spirals and thinner radiating ribs, which make the shell cancellated. These ribs become lamellose (with flared axial projections) on the lower whorls. The lirae are beaded where the ribs cross them, less obvious on the lower whorls, the uppermost of the lirae on each whorl with a series of small tubercles, giving a coronated appearance to the whorls. The body whorl is rounded, the peripheral spiral being only very little prominent. The base of the shell is convex, with 6 beaded lirae, cancellated by numerous, irregular, radiating ribs. The aperture is nearly rounded. The outer and basal margins are rounded, thin, thickened interiorly, with about 17 short lirae on the internal rib, of which that near the columella slightly tooth-like. The columella is cylindrical, rather straight, with a tooth-like fold at the base, bordering a rounded notch. The parietal wall is callous.

The movement took place under a military dictatorship and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” Folha de S. Paulo (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981. The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,Playboy magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a \\"crusade against pornography.\\" See: \\"Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia.\\" Jornal do Brasil, March 16th, 1982, p. 4. and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and pansexuality. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book Antolorgia, published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). Antolorgia (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984). History The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by Eduardo Kac in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). Antolorgia (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188. Kac invited Cairo TrindadeRodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ArteManha, Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8. to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called Pelo Topless Literário (Literary Topless).Gang, n. 1, May 1980, p. 1. This was a sudden invasion of the beach's Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city). Soon after the Literary Topless intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang. Kac and Trindade wrote the Manifesto Pornô (Porn Manifesto) in May 1980 and first published it in the movement's zine Gang, n. 1, September 1980. The movement published a total of three editions of the Gang zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist's books and anthologies.Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). Antolorgia (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178. Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at Rio’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the National Museum of Fine Arts. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the Porn Manifesto on September 9, 1980.Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). Antolorgia (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176. The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro. On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach's Lifeguard Post 9.Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). Antolorgia (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177. This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). Antolorgia (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189. mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by lawIn 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach. ), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” Pasquim, n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6. The videographer Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions. The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled Destricted.The DVD compilation Destricted was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney. The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac's series entitled Pornogramas (Pornograms), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982. ; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show Losing the Human Form, realized in October 2012. The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana. Una imagen sísmica de los años ochenta en América Latina (Madrid: Museo Reina Sofia, 2012), pp. 199-203.

Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called Jornal Dobrabil, a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.Glauco Mattoso, Jornal Dobrabil (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001). Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement's agenda while inviting the movement's participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled Pornograms, hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two Pornograms in his artist's book Escracho, which he published in 1983.

The sale would make the Temple the second standalone performance venue in Cattaraugus County, alongside the Ray Evans Seneca Theater in Salamanca. A zoning variance was unanimously approved in August to allow the conversion.https://wesb.com/2019/08/10/olean-board- approves-theater-project/ A Torah originally donated to the congregation was reunited with a family member of the original donor in 2019, Oscar Rosenbloom Jr., who then donated it to Camp Towonga, a Jewish youth summer camp outside Yosemite National Park in Northern California.

As per Census of India 2011, there are 33 household with a total population of 189 persons, out of which 96 are male while 93 are female. Etymology The term Khokon means a zig-zag village. History Khokon village was established in the first decade of the 19th century. The original village located in Ukhrul district between Kachai and Phungtal villages. It was situated at the top of the mountain. During those years there was much rivalry among the Tangkhuls and headhunting was common among them. In such circumstances Khokon villagers due to their sheer physical strength and modern warfare they controlled the warring clans and villages in Ukhrul district, and as a result brought about the much needed peace and tranquility in the area. In post-independence India, the rising Naga nationalism and militancy led some of the Tangkhul nationalists to serve quit notice to Khokon villagers forgetting their contribution in the past. Their village was burnt down by Naga nationalists in 1961.The Plight of Indigenous Kuki People, p. 42, sl. no. 45, published by Kuki Movement for Human Rights (KUMHUR), 2009 As a result they left their homesteads in 1961.PS Haokip, Zale'n-gam: The Kuki Nation, KNO Publication, 2008, p. 562. The chief of Khokon Pu Ngulthong Haokip reestablish the village again in Saikul subdivision in 1979. Location Khokon village is located at 24°59'33.3\\"N latitude, and 93°59'47.8\\"E longitude. It is situated at a height of 790 m above sea level, and just about 35 Kilometres from Imphal, the capital city of Manipur. Literacy As per the Census of India 2011, Khokon has a literacy rate of 56.68%, out of which the male population is 61.05% and female is 52.17%. Church The people in the village had been largely converted during the 19th century, and they are affiliated to Kuki Baptist Convention, a Baptist Kuki denomination in Northeast India. Occupation Even though Khokonites were traditionally cultivators and animal rearers, with the passage of time they largely shifted to small businesses and other skilled professions such as knitting and yarning. The educated ones are engaged in teaching and research in various universities of India and also as medical practitioners. A sections of youths also migrated to different metropolitan cities in the country to work in various companies and BPOs.

Co. Inc., Iloilo, Philippines, intended for service between the Philippines West Coast and North America. The ship was engaged in normal commerce until it became a key player in events in the Philippines after December 7, 1941, and the Japanese invasion of the islands. Dona Nati had arrived in Manila along with the ships President Grant,This is apparently the SS President Grant (1920) originally named Centennial State then President Adams in 1923 and President Grant in 1940. A former President Grant was at the time also in transit to become part of the Pensacola Convoy. John Lykes, Cape Fairweather, and American Leader in a convoy escorted by the USS Boise (CL-47) on December 4, 1941. She had escaped to Australia where she became particularly notable as being one of only three ships to successfully run the Japanese blockade in attempts to supply the forces cut off in the Philippines. The ship was retained under Army control and on April 28, 1943, was one of twenty-eight vessels forming the fleet available to the Southwest Pacific command under General MacArthur. Pre war On July 29 Japanese military officials prevented Japanese cargo for the United States to be loaded aboard Dona Nati in Shanghai, China, in the first Japanese retaliation for the United States' freezing trade with Japan on July 25, 1941. } On November 17, 1941, the ship left Hawaii in convoy with other vessels bound for Guam and the Philippines escorted by the cruiser USS Boise (CL-47), arriving in Manila on December 4, 1941. Wartime operations Dona Nati arrived in Manila and began discharging cargo consigned to that port, and on or about December 10, 1941, got orders from the owners to discharge cargo consigned to Hong Kong and Shanghai as well. On December 12, with Japanese landings on Luzon, the Navy ordered the ship to sail to avoid loss, with the ship sailing for Fremantle, Australia, December 13, 1941, to discharge cargo that was still aboard. In January the Dona Nati was acquired for use of the United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA).United States Forces in Australia (USFIA), the original name, was used until re-designation as United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) on 5 January 1942, previous to Dona Nati's blockade running voyage. Details of the exact terms of the acquisition were not entirely clear during the early days of the war, but by April Dona Nati was noted as being under War Shipping Administration time charter. The mission of USAFIA initially was \\"to dispatch airplanes and ammunition to the Philippines, and, in cooperation with U. S. naval authorities, to retain vessels long enough to unload at any port of his selection, to be reached by any route that he chose\\" and under that mission Dona Nati sailed under Captain Ramon Pons from Brisbane, Australia on February 18,Attempts to Supply The Philippines by Sea: 1942; Charles Dana Gibson and E. Kay Gibson arriving March 10 at Cebu City with supplies that included an estimated 5,000 tons of rations for the Philippines. Thus Dona Nati became one of only three ships, the others being Coast Farmer and the Chinese ship Anhui, to break the Japanese blockade and return. One of the other De La Rama ships, Don Isidro was sunk 19–20 February making an attempt. Together the three ships brought into the Philippines \\"more than 10,000 tons of rations, 4,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, 8,000 rounds of 81-mm. ammunition, and miscellaneous medical, signal, and engineer supplies\\" but all had to be transshipped on smaller, fast interisland vessels, few of which made the trip north successfully. Dona Nati left Cebu City just hours before arrival of a Japanese cruiser that shelled the port, taking with her civilian passengers fleeing the Philippines (one escaping from as far as China), and arrived 30 March in Brisbane after taking a circuitous route lasting twenty-two days. In July 1942 the ship was noted as transporting elements of the 91st Engineer Regiment to the Cape York Peninsula to construct advance airfields. By March 6, 1943 Dona Nati had been withdrawn from the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) fleet. The ship next appears arriving at Guadalcanal on April 2, 1943 where she came under heavy air attack and claimed one plane shot down and one damaged; she departed April 7.  Postwar  The ship was sold in 1951, replaced by a larger and faster Dona Nati cargo liner built early that year by Nishi Nippon of Nagasaki, Japan, to Japanese interests and renamed Asahisan Maru then Akakurasan Maru (1956) until sold to Wah Kwong & Co. in 1964 and renamed Union Venture then sold again in 1968 and named Gelora of the Asia-Africa Shipping Co. until scrapped at Kaohsiung.

In the 20th century, humans have learned to harness fungi to protect human health (antibiotics, anti-cholesterol statins, and immunosuppressive agents), while industry has utilized fungi for large scale production of enzymes, acids, and biosurfactants. With the advent of modern nanotechnology in the 1980s, fungi have remained important by providing a greener alternative to chemically synthesized nanoparticle.  Background  SEM image of fungal hyphae and fungal derived silver nanoparticles showing a large conglomeration made up of individual nanoparticles with fungal hyphae (dark areas) in background. A nanoparticle is defined as having one dimension 100 nm or less in size. Environmentally toxic or biologically hazardous reducing agents are typically involved in the chemical synthesis of nanoparticles so there has been a search for greener production alternatives. Current research has shown that microorganisms, plant extracts, and fungi can produce nanoparticles through biological pathways. The most common nanoparticles synthesized by fungi are silver and gold, however fungi have been utilized in the synthesis other types of nanoparticles including zinc oxide, platinum, magnetite, zirconia, silica, titanium, and cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide quantum dots.  Silver nanoparticle production  Synthesis of silver nanoparticles has been investigated utilizing many ubiquitous fungal species including Trichoderma, Fusarium, Penicillium, Rhizoctonia, Pleurotus and Aspergillus. Extracellular systhesis has been demonstrated by Trichoderma virde, T. reesei, Fusarium oxysporm, F. semitectum, F. solani, Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. clavatus, Pleurotus ostreatus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium brevicompactum, P. fellutanum, an endophytic Rhizoctonia sp., Epicoccum nigrum, Chrysosporium tropicum, and Phoma glomerata, while intracellular synthesis was shown to occur in a Verticillium species, and in Neurospora crassa.  Gold nanoparticle production  Synthesis of gold nanoparticles has been investigated utilizing Fusarium, Neurospora, Verticillium, yeasts, and Aspergillus. Extracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis was demonstrated by Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus niger, and cytosolic extracts from Candida albican. Intracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis has been demonstrated by a Verticillum species, V. luteoalbum,  Miscellaneous nanoparticle production  In addition to gold and silver, Fusarium oxysporum has been used to synthesize zirconia, titanium, cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide nanosize particles. Cadmium sulfide nanoparticles have also been synthesized by Trametes versicolor, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Candida glabrata. The white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has also been demonstrated to be able to synthesize elemental selenium nanoparticles.  Culture techniques and conditions  Culture techniques and media vary depending upon the requirements of the fungal isolate involved, however the general procedure consist of the following: fungal hyphae are typically placed in liquid growth media and placed in shake culture until the fungal culture has increased in biomass. The fungal hyphae are removed from the growth media, washed with distilled water to remove the growth media, placed in distilled water and incubated on shake culture for 24 to 48 hours. The fungal hyphae are separated from the supernatant, and an aliquot of the supernatant is added to 1.0 mM ion solution. The ion solution is then monitored for 2 to 3 days for the formation of nanoparticles. Another common culture technique is to add washed fungal hyphae directly into 1.0 mM ion solution instead of utilizing the fungal filtrate. Silver nitrate is the most widely used source of silver ions, but silver sulfate has also been utilized. Choloroauric acid is generally used as the source of gold ions at various concentrations (1.0 mM and 250 mg to 500 mg of Au per liter). Cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis for F. oxysporum was conducted using a 1:1 ratio of Cd2+ and SO42− at a 1 mM concentration. Gold nanoparticles can vary in shape and size depending on the pH of the ion solution. Gericke and Pinches (2006) reported that for V. luteoalbum small (cc.10 nm) spherical gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 3, larger (spherical, triangular, hexagon and rods) gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 5, and at pH 7 to pH 9 the large nanoparticles tend to lack a defined shape. Temperature interactions for both silver and gold nanoparticles were similar; a lower temperature resulted in larger nanoparticles while higher temperatures produced smaller nanoparticles.  Analytical techniques   Visual observations  For externally synthesized silver nanoparticles the silver ion solution generally becomes brownish in color, but this browning reaction may be absent. For fungi that synthesize intracellular silver nanoparticles, the hyphae darken to a brownish color while the solution remains clear. In both cases the browning reaction is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic nanoparticles. For external gold nanoparticle production, the solution color can vary depending on the size of the gold nanoparticles; smaller particles appear pink while large particles appear purple. Intracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis typically turns the hyphae purple while the solution remains clear. Externally synthesized cadmium sulfide nanoparticles were reported to make the solution color appear bright yellow.  Analytical tools  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDX), UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction are used to characterize different aspects of nanoparticles. Both SEM and TEM can be used to visualize the location, size, and morphology of the nanoparticles, while UV-vis spectroscopy can be used to confirm the metallic nature, size and aggregation level. Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray is used to determine elemental composition, and X-ray diffraction is used to determine chemical composition and crystallographic structure. UV-Vis absorption peaks for silver, gold, and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles can vary depending on particle size: 25-50 nm silver particles peak ca. 415 nm, gold nanoparticles 30-40 nm peak ca. 450 nm, while a cadmium sulfide absorption edge ca. 450 is indicative of quantum size particles. Larger nanoparticle of each type will have UV-Vis absorption peaks or edges that shift to longer wavelengths while smaller nanoparticles will have UV-Vis absorption peaks or edges that shift to shorter wavelengths.  Formation mechanisms   Gold and silver  SEM image of fungal derived silver nanoparticles stabilized by a capping agent. Nitrate reductase was suggested to initiate nanoparticle formation by many fungi including Penicillium species, while several enzymes, α-NADPH-dependent reductases, nitrate-dependent reductases and an extracellular shuttle quinone, were implicated in silver nanoparticle synthesis for Fusarium oxysporum. Jain et al. (2011) indicated that silver nanoparticle synthesis for A. flavus occurs initially by a \\"33kDa\\" protein followed by a protein (cystein and free amine groups) electrostatic attraction which stabilizes the nanoparticle by forming a capping agent. Intracellular silver and gold nanoparticle synthesis is not fully understood but similar fungal cell wall surface electrostatic attraction, reduction, and accumulation has been proposed. External gold nanoparticle synthesis by P. chrysosporium was attributed to laccase, while intracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis was attributed to ligninase.  Cadmium sulfide  Cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis by yeast involves sequestration of Cd2+ by glutathione-related peptides followed by reduction within the cell. Ahmad et al. (2002) reported that cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis by Fusarium oxysporum was based on a sulfate reductase (enzyme) process.

She was influential in advocacy for the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which sought to give women the right to vote.  Early life  Ellen Clark was born in Massachusetts in 1826. As a teenager in Newburyport, Massachusetts, she fell in love with Aaron Augustus Sargent, 1 year her junior, an aspiring journalist and politician. Both taught Sunday school in the local Methodist Church. In 1847 Aaron Sargent left Ellen to go west. By 1849, he came to Nevada City, California, to search for gold. He built a four-room house on Broad Street and in early 1852 returned to Newburyport, where he and Ellen were married on March 15. They arrived in Nevada City that October. Ellen wrote of her arrival: : \\"My good husband had before my arrival provided for me a one story house of four rooms including a good sized pantry where he had already stored a bag of flour, a couple of pumpkins and various other edibles ready for use.\\"  Suffrage advocacy  While Aaron prospered in business, politics and the law, Ellen raised three children: daughters Ellen and Elizabeth and son George. She also advocated for women's rights, and in 1869 founded the Nevada County Women's Suffrage Organization. Soon afterward, she became president of the California Woman Suffrage Association.Silver, Mae. \\"Ellen Clark Sargent\\". Found SF. Retrieved 13 April 2014. In 1869, Susan B.

Anthony was a close friend of Sargent, and a frequent guest in the Sargent homes in California and Washington D.C. In 1872, Aaron was elected to the United States Senate and the Sargent family moved to Washington. Their relationship was such that Anthony accompanied the Sargent family on their trip across the country.  Nineteenth Amendment  In 1878, Aaron, while a Senator, had proposed a constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, but it was not passed. The bill was reintroduced in 1919 and enacted in 1920 as the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Later life  Sargent lived in Washington, on and off, for 12 years. She accompanied Aaron to Germany, when he was appointed U.S. Minister.Rozynski, Brita, Aaron Sargent (Part Two), Nevada County Historical Society Bulletin, Vol. 65, No. 2, (April 2011). After Aaron died in 1887, she returned to San Francisco, where the Sargents had bought a home before he was elected to the Senate. She continued her activities with the California Suffrage Association and the National American Women Suffrage Association.

He ran a dead-heat with Euclid in the classic before winning the prize in a deciding heat. In a racing career which lasted from July 1839 until September 1843 he won nineteen of his thirty-four races. Unraced as a two-year-old, Charles the Twelfth was unbeaten in three races as a three-year-old in 1839. He won the Liverpool Tradesmen's Cup before winning the St Leger and then beat a strong field of older horses in the Doncaster Cup. Charles the Twelfth remained in training for four more years, winning once in 1840, ten times in 1841, four times in 1842 and once in 1843. He won the Goodwood Cup in 1841 and 1842.

Yarburgh sent the colt into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners at his base at Whitewall stables, Malton, North Yorkshire.

Charles the Twelfth's sire, Voltaire was a successful racehorse who won the Doncaster Cup in 1829. He went on to become a good stallion, with his best son apart from Charles the Twelfth being the Derby and St Leger winner Voltigeur. Racing career 1839: three-year-old season The dead-heat between Charles the Twelfth and Euclid in the 1839 St Leger Charles the Twelfth was unraced as a two-year-old and made his first appearance in July 1839 at Aintree Racecourse. He was assigned a weight of six stones and six pounds in the Liverpool Tradesmen's Cup, an all-aged handicap race over two miles and started at odds of 5/1 in a field of sixteen runners. Ridden by a lightweight jockey named Francis, Charles the Twelfth disputed the lead with the five- year-old St Bennett before pulling clear in the closing stages to win easily. The New Sporting Magazine described the performance as a \\"true St Leger running\\". Charles the Twelfth beats Euclid in the deciding heat of the St Leger On 17 September Charles the Twelfth was one of fourteen runners (from an original entry of 107) to contest the St Leger Stakes: he was ridden by his trainer's brother Bill Scott and was made the 6/4 favourite ahead of the Derby winner Bloomsbury. The weather was cold and wet, leading to heavy ground and an unusually poor attendance. Bill Scott attempted to repeat the tactics he had employed on Don John the previous year by taking the lead shortly after the start and setting a very fast pace. Most of the other horses were well- beaten before the turn into the straight, but as Charles the Twelfth approached the final furlong Euclid, ridden by Patrick Conolly, emerged as a serious challenger. Euclid briefly overtook Charles the Twelfth and appeared the likely winner but the favourite rallied and after a \\"head and head\\" struggle the two colts crossed the finishing line together. The judge declared a dead heat and the owners agreed to run a run-off. Both horses had appeared \\"much distressed\\" after the race which was run in 3 minutes 25 seconds. The early stages deciding heat, for which Euclid started a slight favourite, were run at a very slow pace, as both jockeys attempted to employ waiting tactics. Conolly eventually sent Euclid into the lead which he held until Charles the Twelfth made his challenge in the straight. As in the first race, the two colts raced together throughout the closing stages, but Bill Scott always appeared to have the upper hand and Charles the Twelfth won \\"rather cleverly\\" by a head. The time for the second heat was 3:45. Two days later Charles the Twelfth was matched against older horses, including the leading stayers Bee's-wing and Lanercost in the Doncaster Cup over two miles five furlongs. Despite the facts that state of the ground had deteriorated further and that he was carrying a three-pound weight penalty he started the 11/8 favourite. Bee's-wing made the early running but faded in the straight. Lanercost looked the likely winner, but the three-year-old demonstrated \\"courage and energy of the first order\\" to take the lead in the last strides to win by a head. 1840: four-year-old season Before the start of the 1840 season, Charles the Twelfth was sold to the Scottish businessman Andrew Johnstone. Charles the Twelfth made his first appearance as a four-year-old in the Liverpool Tradesmen's Cup on 15 July. Carrying 125 pounds he sustained his first defeat as he finished third of the sixteen runners behind Lord Westminster's Sleight- of-hand. On the following afternoon he won the Grosvenor Stakes over one and three-quarter miles, beating Lord Westminster's three-year-old Maroon. Later that month Charles the Twelfth finished unplaced behind Beggarman in the Goodwood Cup. In September, the colt returned to the scene of his classic victory but finished third to Bee's-wing and The Provost in the Doncaster Cup. Later that month he finished last of the four runners behind Gallipot in the Stewards' Cup at Liverpool. On his final appearance of a disappointing season, Charles the Twelfth had his first run in Scotland and was beaten by Lanercost in the Gold Cup at Dumfries. 1841: five-year-old season Charles the Twelfth had his most successful season in 1841, when he won ten of his eleven races. He began his season in April at Catterick Bridge Racecourse in Yorkshire where he won the local Gold Cup from two opponents. and at Newcastle Racecourse in Northumberland on 21 June he defeated Bee's-wing at weight-for- age in the Craven Stakes. In July he started favourite for the Liverpool Tradesmen's Cup despite carrying top weight, but finished unplaced behind Orelia, sustaining the only defeat of the year. Later that month he was one of ten horses to contest the Gold Cup at Goodwood and carried top weight to victory from Hyllus. In August he won the Cleveland Cup at Wolverhampton Racecourse at odds of 5/6 conceding weight to his three opponents. In the autumn of 1841, Charles the Twelfth competed in Scotland where he was unbeaten in his six races. At the Royal Caledonian Hunt meeting at Stirling in October, he won a 50 sovereign race over two miles, and walked over for the Challenge Whip and a Queen's Plate. Before the end of the month he walked over for another Queen's Plate at Edinburgh and the Gold Cup at Dumfries before beating The Little Known and Master Syntax in the Roxburgh Gold Cup at Kelso. 1842: six-year-old season Charles the Twelfth began his six-year-old season with another race against Bee's-wing and was beaten four lengths by the mare at weight-for age in the Gold Cup at Newcastle in June. At Goodwood in July Charles the Twelfth beat Hyllus by a neck in a £1000 match race over two miles and reappeared two days later for the Goodwood Cup. Ridden by Jem Robinson and carrying top weight of 135 pounds, he won by two lengths from the three-year- old Policy to take the Cup for the second year in succession. At the Doncaster St Leger meeting Charles the Twelfth finished unplaced under top weight of 138 pounds in the Great Yorkshire Handicap and ran second to Bee's-wing in the Doncaster Cup. Later that month Charles the Twelfth ran at Kelso where he finished second to Cabrerea in the Roxburgh Gold Cup and was beaten when attempting to concede 40 pounds to the three-year-old Whistle Blinkie in a two and a half-mile handicap. On 7 October at the Royal Caledonian Hunt meeting at Perth Racecourse Charles the Twelfth retained the Challenge Whip by beating Foxberry over two miles. Six days later he defeated Foxberry again to win his second Dumfries Gold Cup. 1843: seven-year-old season In June 1843 Charles the Twelfth started 5/2 favourite for the Gold Vase at Ascot Racecourse but finished unplaced behind the three-year-old Gorhambury. Later that month at Newcastle he recorded his last win when he won the Craven Stakes over one mile, beating the four-year-old Agreeable but then finished unplaced in the Newcastle Gold Cup. In July Charles the Twelfth carried top weight of 135 pounds in the Goodwood Cup: he started the 9/2 third favourite, but finished unplaced behind Hyllus. Charles the Twelfth returned to Doncaster for his final race in which he finished second to Alice Hawthorn in the Doncaster Cup. Stud record Charles the Twelfth began his career as a breeding stallion at Sheffield Lane Paddocks near Ecclesfield in South Yorkshire at a fee of 12 guineas. By 1848 he had moved to George Tattersall's stud at Willesden Paddocks, where he stood at a fee of fifteen guineas. Charles the Twelfth was euthanised on 12 October 1859 and buried at an old quarry near Sheffield. The most successful of his progeny was the gelding Little Charley, the winner of the 1858 Grand National. Charles the Twelfth's daughter Olga had some influence as a broodmare, being the female-line ancestor of White Nose (Melbourne Cup), Eclair au Chocolat (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) and Gallahadion.http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family4e.htm Pedigree References Category:1836 racehorse births Category:1859 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 21-a Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Charles the Twelfth"},{"id":"39169567","text":"Banco Gallego, S.A. was a Spanish bank based in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia.

Biography Son of Camillo Finocchiaro Aprile, a liberal politician and several times minister, and the Sicilian noblewoman Giovanna Sartorio. His brother was Emanuele Finocchiaro Aprile, also a Deputy during the Kingdom of Italy. Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile was a professor of \\"history of law\\" at the University of Ferrara and at the University of Siena. He began his political activity with the election as deputy to the Chamber of Deputies in 1913 as a liberal, following in his father's footsteps. Re-elected in 1919 with Democratic Social Party, he was appointed Undersecretary for War in the Nitti I Cabinet until 1920 and Undersecretary for Finance in the Nitti II Cabinet. Re-elected also in 1921, he opposed the nascent fascist regime as a Freemason, and in 1924 he ran on the lists of Giovanni Amendola's National Union, but this time he was not re-elected. He retired from active politics in 1925 and returned to practice as a lawyer. In 1936 he expressed his consent to the Ethiopian war and to the union of Albania with Italy. In the winter of 1942 he made contact with exponents of Sicilian pre-fascist politics. He officially returned to politics in June 1943, a few days before the landing of the allies in Sicily, launching in Palermo an appeal with an Action Committee for passive resistance against fascist Italy, a committee that became the original nucleus of the Movement for the Independence of Sicily (MIS). He also maintained close contacts with both the British and US secret services, and therefore with the Amgot, to support the separatist cause. He authorized the birth of the Voluntary Army for the Independence of Sicily (EVIS) in 1944. That year he escaped an attack during a demonstration organized by the MIS in Regalbuto but, in the same year, he was arrested for order of the Bonomi government. The MIS in 1944 came to count almost half a million members. He returned free in 1945 but, in October of the same year, he was arrested again with his right arm Antonino Varvaro and sent to political confinement in Ponza, where he remained until March 1946. In June 1946 he was elected deputy to the Constituent Assembly on the lists of the MIS. In 1947 the partnership with Varvaro dissolved due to serious differences on the conception of the party. The secretary wanted the movement to take a precise political position, in the case in point on the left, while Finocchiaro Aprile considered it transversal to any ideology. In the III national congress of Taormina, Varvaro was expelled from the MIS also due to pressure from the \\"right-wing\\" fringe (Tasca–Carcaci). In May 1947 he was elected deputy to the Sicilian Regional Assembly, from which he resigned in March 1948, to run again for the Chamber of Deputies, but he was not elected. He therefore decided to leave the MIS which - after losing all national and regional parliamentary representation - dissolved in 1951. In 1953 he accepted, without being elected, to stand for the general election among the ranks of the National Democratic Alliance. Subsequently, he was appointed judge of the High Court for the Sicilian Region.

Named after its propagator, Connecticut wine grower Henry Ives, the grape's pedigree and exact origin are unclear. After Prohibition in the United States, Ives was a popular grape used in the production of sweet port-style wines but saw its plantings steadily decrease throughout the 20th century as the vine's susceptibility to air pollution took its toll.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 477, Allen Lane 2012 History and pedigree While Ives noir was a popular grape after the end of Prohibition, the vine's susceptibility to air pollution caused plantings of the variety to decline throughout the 20th century. According to the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) the grape was first developed in Ohio in 1844 from a crossing of an unknown Vitis species and Hartford Proflic (itself a crossing of an unknown Vitis labrusca vine and Isabella that was developed in Connecticut).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Ives noir Accessed: April 20th, 2013Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Hartford Accessed: April 20th, 2013 The National Grape Registry maintained by the University of California, Davis list 1850 as the release date.National Grape Registry \\"Ives noir\\" Accessed: April 20th, 2013 Writings from Henry Ives himself dates the crossing to 1840. However, the earliest record of Hartford Prolific being cultivated dates back to 1846 with the VIVC dating the crossing even later to 1849. This inconsistency puts the pedigree of Ives noir in question. In other writings, Henry Ives claimed that he cultivated the grape from a seedling of a Vitis vinifera variety called either \\"Malaga\\" or \\"Madeira\\" but ampelographers as early as the late 19th century found little evidence to support any vinifera pedigree or relationship to the Malaga wine grapes Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel or the traditional Madeira wine grapes of Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho, Sercial, Terrantez and Bastardo. While DNA analysis of Ives noir has not yet taken place, today ampelographers believe that the grape is likely derived from unknown Vitis labrusca and Vitis aestivalis vines. Ives noir was widely established in the eastern United States by the end of Prohibition in the 1930s when the grape became popular with wineries making sweet fortified wines. However, by the end of the 20th century, plantings of the grape were declining significantly as the toll of air pollution in the United States resulted in crop failure for the sensitive vine. Viticulture Ives noir is a mid-ripening variety that usually ripens before Concord. The vine is very sensitive to air pollution, ozone damage as well as sulphur-based sprays (such as the Bordeaux mixture used to combat powdery and downy mildew). When not grafted to more vigorous rootstock, Ives noir tend to produce a shallow and weak root system that also makes the vine very susceptible to water stress which may require irrigation in drought conditions. Wine regions Ives noir shares many similarities to the Vitis labrusca grape variety Concord (pictured). Today Ives noir is planted mostly in the Eastern United States and in the Southern States of Brazil where the variety is known as Bordô or Terci. Plantings in New York State were significantly impacted by downwind air pollution from Michigan and Ohio but as Clean Air Act standards enforced by the United States Environmental Protection Agency take effect, plantings of the variety have slowly started to recover with 50 acres (20 hectare) of Ives noir in production as of 1996. Outside of New York there were 15 acres (6 acres) of Ives noir in production in Arkansas, including some old vine plantings that were over 50 years old, as well as smaller plantings in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Styles and uses In addition to winemaking, Ives noir is also used in grape juice and jelly production. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the grape shares many similarities to Concord, including the characterized \\"foxy\\" note of Vitis labrusca grapes, but usually with a slightly lighter color . Ives noir is used as both a blending and varietal grape making wines from a range of sweetness styles from dry to semi-sweet blush wines and to sweet fortified wines. Synonyms Over the years Ives noir has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Black Ives, Bordô or Terci Embrapa - Official Site Accessed: December 26th, 2014 (in Brazil), Ives Madeira, Ives' Madeira Seedling, Ives Seedling and Kittredge.

Born on a Mississippi plantation, she later lived in East Coast cities with her physician husband before they moved to Pasadena in 1897. There she gradually became deeply interested in desert plants and habitat. Early life and move to California Minerva Hamilton was born on March 27, 1866 on a plantation near Durant, Mississippi to an upper-class family. She attended a local school for white students, many from the planter class. After marrying Dr. Albert Sherman Hoyt, they live for a time in New York and Baltimore, and had two sons together. In 1897 they moved to South Pasadena, California. In California, Hoyt used her influence as a wealthy socialite to support civic causes. Among these was the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  Preserving natural habitat  Hoyt became interested in Southern California's desert plants through her interest in gardening, particularly cactus and Joshua Trees. After the death of her husband in 1918, she became concerned that increased automobile traffic in the desert was threatening the area. Hoyt began to exhibit desert plants across the country, to educate people about their qualities. Exhibitions included the national 1928 Garden Club of America show in New York, where the work was seen and commented on by Secretary of Agriculture William Jardine. She later exhibited as far as London. The exhibitions were significant efforts—for the New York exhibition, seven freight cars of rocks, plants, and sand were shipped across the country, and fresh flowers were flown in. In March, 1930 Hoyt founded the International Desert Conservation League. Throughout the 1930s she worked to encourage the state of California to create three parks, including Joshua Tree, Death Valley, and Anza-Borrego Desert. Though initially thwarted, in 1936, she gained support by the administration of President Franklin D.

Biography Umberto Fiore was born in Giampilieri, a fraction of Messina, in 1896. Having survived the 1908 earthquake, his father enrolled him in a technical school in Caltanissetta. He returned to Messina after completing his studies and, in 1913, organized the first youth socialist groups in the city. At the outbreak of the First World War he was drafted as an officer in the 1st Genie Regiment. His socialist propaganda activity continued in the trenches and due to these actions he was sentenced to seven years in prison, with the obligation to return to the front lines. Here he was injured in 1917 during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo. Discharged and amnestied, he returned to Messina; in 1921 he joined the Communist Party of Italy. In August of the same year, he moved to Milan for work, continuing the trade unionist activity he had developed in Sicily. In 1922 he was appointed editor in chief of the communist sheet \\"The red union\\". In 1923 he was forced to emigrate to France following the fascist intimidation he suffered in those years. He found refuge in Paris, where he continued in the anti-regime propaganda activity. In contrast to the French communists, due to its position close to Trotskyism, it returned to Italy, to its hometown. He was arrested in 1926 by the OVRA, sent initially to confinement and subsequently sentenced in 1928 to an eight-year prison sentence. The amnesty of 1932 allowed him the reduction of sentence; released from prison he continued in subversive action to the fascist regime. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was deported to the Lacedonia prison camp, where he remained until the signing of the armistice in September 1943. At the end of the conflict he became a member of the National Council and was appointed undersecretary to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the Bonomi III Cabinet, with Giovanni Gronchi as Minister. Elected deputy to the Constituent Assembly, he was Senator by right in the I legislature (1948–53) for the discounted prison term; subsequently, he was re-elected to the Senate until the 4th legislature, keeping the seat until 1968.

The SNAP sizing method complements ISO/IEC 20926:2009, which defines a method for the sizing of functional user requirements. SNAP is a product of the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG), and is sized using the “Software Non-functional Assessment Practices Manual,” (APM) now in version 2.4. The SNAP methodology has the IEEE standard IEEE2430-2019.  Introduction  “Software sizing or software size estimation is an activity in software engineering that is used to determine or estimate the size of a software application or component in order to be able to implement other software project management activities (such as estimating or tracking). Size is an inherent characteristic of a piece of software just like weight is an inherent characteristic of a tangible material.” A software application can provide two aspects of value to its users. The first aspect is its data processing capacity. This is basically the flow and storage of data through the application. This flow and storage can be defined as its “functionality.” One metric used to measure the size of one unit of this functionality is the “function point.” By using an ISO-standard functional sizing metric (FSM) such as that in the IFPUG “Function Point Counting Practices Manual,”IFPUG, “Function Point Counting Practices Manual” v. 4.3, Princeton Junction, NJ, 08550 USA 2009. (FSM ISO/IEC 20926:2009),International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 20926:2009, https://www.iso.org/standard/51717.html, Geneva, Switzerland, 2009. a function point counting specialist can examine the software application’s functional portion and measure its functional size in units of function points. For more detail on the function point metric, and other organizations’ functional software sizing metrics, see the bibliography, the Wikipedia article “function point,” and numerous references in the literature. A software application can also provide aspects which are other than data processing capacity. These types of software are defined by IFPUG as being “non-functional.” Their size is measured by SNAP. The IFPUG APMIFPUG, “Software Non-functional Assessment Process Assessment Practices Manual” v. 2.4, Princeton Junction, NJ, 08550 USA 2017. details how to size the non- functional aspects of software applications. The SNAP methodology has the IEEE standard IEEE2430-2019.IEEE 2430-2019, “Draft Standard for Software Non- Functional Sizing Measurements” IEEE Corporate Headquarters, 3 Park Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10016-5997 USA, 2019. The non-functional aspects are defined and classified in ISO/IEC 25010:2011, “Systems and software engineering -- Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) -- System and software quality models”.ISO/IEC 25010:2011, Systems and software engineering -- Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) -- System and software quality models. The functional size, together with the non- functional size, should be used for measuring the size of software projects. The two sizes should be used to measure the performance of the software project, setting benchmarks, and estimating the cost and duration of software projects.  The Non-functional Sizing Method  Similar to function point sizing, one unit of non-functionality is the “SNAP point” and the sizing of the non-functional portion of an application can be measured by using the procedure in the APM. Similar to function points, by using the IFPUG APM, a SNAP point counting specialist can examine the software application and measure the size of its non-functional portion in units of SNAP points. Also like function points, the number of SNAP points in an application correlates with the work effort to develop the non-functional portion of that application. The original research detailing this correlation is in CrossTalk The Journal of Defense Software Engineering, as the paper “A New Software Metric to Complement Function Points The Software Non-functional Assessment Process (SNAP)”.CrossTalk The Journal of Defense Software Engineering, “A New Software Metric to Compliment Function Points The Software Non-functional Assessment Process,” Ogden ALC/TISE, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, July-August 2013. Each portion (the functional and the non-functional) of the software project requires work effort to develop, which is proportional to their software sizes. Software development organizations can use their correlations between function points and their work effort, and between SNAP points and their work effort, to help forecast their software development costs and schedules and to audit projects to determine how well funding was spent and schedules were managed SNAP recognizes four categories and 14 subcategories of non-functionality. These are in the below table from the APM. ;1. Data Operations 1.1.Data Entry Validations 1.2.Logical and Mathematical Operations 1.3.Data Formatting 1.4.Internal Data Movements 1.5.Delivering Added Value to Users by Data Configuration ;2. Interface Design 2.1.User Interfaces 2.2.Help Methods 2.3.Multiple Input Methods 2.4.Multiple Output Formats ;3. Technical Environment 3.1.Multiple Platform 3.2.Database Technology 3.3.Batch Processes ;4. Architecture 4.1.Component Based Software 4.2.Multiple Input / Output interfaces For example, software development to change the field sizes for data in a data table does not represent changes in data processing capacity. However, this development requires work effort. Data Formatting is considered non-functional, and is countable under SNAP subcategory 1.3. Help Methods (subcategory 2.2) are usually considered non- functional. When compared to the function point process, which requires data to cross an application’s boundary and maintain an internal logical file, the Help data may be coded to reside internally as part of the application development and be accessed upon command from the user. This access can be anything from bubble help over an icon on a screen, to access of part of an internally stored application operations manual. Data is not being processed per se, so Help is usually considered non-functional. Function points and SNAP points measure two different aspects of software, and therefore are not added together. For example, an application of 500 function points and 300 SNAP points cannot be considered to be the size 800 of some metric; function points and SNAP points are intended to be orthogonal. A good reference for further detailed information regarding the relationship between functionality and non- functionality is in the document “Glossary of Terms for Non-Functional Requirements and Project Requirements Used in Software Project Performance Measurement, Benchmarking and Estimating”.COSMIC, IFPUG, “Glossary of Terms for Non-Functional Requirements and Project Requirements Used in Software Project Performance Measurement, Benchmarking and Estimating,” v. 1.0, September 2015.  Benefits  SNAP provides users and software development teams many benefits additional to the sole use of function points. Below are five of many examples. * Measuring the non-functional requirements improves the work effort estimation of software development based on functional sizing alone. * This improved work effort estimation should also lead to better estimates of scheduling, resource allocation, and risks. * Including the measure of non-functional size improves the work effort estimation to maintain the software after it is deployed. * The productivity rates of project teams can be better determined because more factors are included in their measured work output. * Including both functional and non-functional work products better demonstrates value delivered to the user. Further, some software development efforts might be measured as having zero function points. For example, an Agile software maintenance sprint might be required only to change the length of data fields in data tables. This would be measured to have zero function points because it is non-functional; however, that work would be accountable in SNAP. SNAP at least partly solves the “0 function point” problem.  Areas for future research  The SNAP beta test in 2012 was conducted using 48 applications. More research will hopefully improve the calibration of the subcategory weighting factors to yield an even stronger statistical correlation. It is recommended that future research results be submitted to IFPUG’s Non-functional Sizing Standards Committee (NFSSC) for review.

He was the first member of a royal house to visit the Australian continent.  Life  Louis d'Orléans with his mother, Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (Victor Mottez, 1851)  Exile in England  Louis d'Orléans was born on 15 November 1845 in Saint-Cloud, the eldest son of Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale and his wife, Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. He was given the title Prince of Condé, originally borne by the House of Bourbon- Condé; however, on the death of Louis Henri, Prince of Condé, it died out. With reference to the most renowned bearer of the title, le Grand Condé, the young Louis d’Orléans was given the nickname \\"le petit Condé\\". Following the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848, he and his family went into exile in England. Later he attended the Royal High School in Edinburgh, where he was taught by Leonhard Schmitz.  Journey to Australia  When Louis d'Orléans was 20 years old, his father arranged an 18-month world tour for him. In the view of his father, a journey through climes beyond the borders of Europe would improve his ailing health. Together with his doctor, Paul Gingeot, and his cousin, Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Alençon, Louis d’Orléans began his journey on 4 February 1866 in Southampton on the Mongolia, a passenger ship owned by British shipping line, Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;). The itinerary was to take him to Egypt, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, Java, China, Japan and India. Louis d'Orléans was especially interested in Australia; he was fascinated by its exotic nature. Because the Suez Canal was still not completed in 1866, after his arrival in Alexandria he travelled by train via Cairo to Suez and then took a smaller ship to join up eventually with the Bengal, another P&O; passenger ship, on which Louis d'Orléans and Gingeot continued their journey. Ferdinand d'Orléans, Duke of Alençon, had left the group in Egypt in order to go on to Manila. After a short stay in Ceylon, they continued their travels on the P&O; liner, Bombay. On 8 April, the Bombay reached King George Sound, a bay on the southwest coast of Western Australia. Louis d'Orléans went ashore at Albany, accompanied by a wealthy businessman from Queensland, and met there, amongst others, the Chief Magistrate of Albany, Sir Alexander Campbell. On 13 April, the Bombay entered the port at Melbourne. Louis d'Orléans, who wanted to get to Sydney as soon as possible, decided to visit the city on his return journey. The Bombay continued along past the colonies of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, past Cape Howe and the Australian Alps. On 16 April 1866, the Bombay tied up at Port Jackson. d'Orléans was very impressed by the town and compared it to old towns around the world. Petty's Hotel, the last residence of the Prince of Condé Although several people, including the Governor of New South Wales, Sir John Young, offered d’Orléans and his travelling companions better accommodation, he decided to stay at Petty's Hotel on Church Hill near St. Philip's. Over the next five weeks, d'Orléans, whose health had markedly improved, went to various social occasions, visited the University of Sydney, the Australian Museum, the Royal Botanic Gardens and Sydney Hospital, during the course of which he met local dignitaries like Edward Deas Thomson, the Chancellor of the University of Sydney, and Charles Moore, the Director of the Botanic Gardens. Other excursions took him to Parramatta, Windsor and Kurrajong.  Death and burial  On 12 May 1866, he received news of the death of his grandmother, Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, which affected him badly and this, together with a cold, that he had picked up during his trip to Manly, caused his health to noticeably worsen. Dr. Gingeot ordered him to rest, but d'Orléans ignored him. After a short-lived improvement, his health deteriorated rapidly, so that Dr. Gingeot sought the opinion of a second doctor. On the evening of 24 May, Louis d'Orléans died in Sydney in the presence of Dr. Gingeot, his valet and archdeacon McEnroe, who administered the last rites. On his death, the title of Prince of Condé died out for a second, and final, time. Over the next few days, various public figures visited Petty's Hotel, including Governor John Young, Chief Justice Alfred Stephen, the Premier of New South Wales James Martin, Commodore Sir William Wiseman and the Consuls of the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium and Brazil, in order to pay their last respects to d'Orléans. Louis Sentis, the French consul, unlike his peers, went as a private individual, because the French government did not recognise the claims of the House of Orléans to the French throne. Portrait by Charles Jalabert The funeral took place on 29 May 1866. A long procession, led by Bishop Aloys Elloy and about 20 clerics, accompanied the coffin from Petty's Hotel to Saint Mary's Cathedral. Amongst the coffin bearers were the Governor, the Chief Justice, the Premier, Commodore Sir William Wiseman and the Belgian consul. Many businesses in Sydney closed during the funeral and the consulates lowered their flags to half mast. Two thousand attended the requiem mass in Saint Mary's Cathedral. Because Archbishop John Bede Polding was in Rome at the time, he was represented at the service by Aloys Elloy. After the end of the service the coffin and the silver container that held the heart of Louis d’Orléans were taken on board the Sea Star which was anchored at Circular Quay. On 2 June 1866 the Sea Star set sail for London with d'Orléans' remains. Also on board were Dr. Gingeot and the prince's retinue. The Sea Star arrived in London on 11 September 1866. After the end of the Second French Empire and the Paris Commune the family of Louis d'Orléans returned to France in 1871 from their exile in England. In 1885, the urn that contained the hearts of the Princes of Condé was placed in the chapel of Château de Chantilly. Here, too, is the final resting place of Louis d'Orléans' heart.

The shell is a rather narrow flat-based cone that is sharply angulated. The shell is small, thin, delicate, smooth, glassy, and nacreous under a thin white calcareous surface. Sculpture: There are longitudinals, which are faint, hairlike and sinuated, showing the old lines of growth. The whole surface has traces of faint, rounded, and irregular spirals. At the bottom of each whorl is a flat puckered band about 0.25 mm. broad, whose upper edge projects sharply, especially on the upper whorls, and whose lower edge is a slight narrow flange, which forms a sharp carina at the periphery. This band forms the upper border of the suture, which is further marginated below by two not continuous rounded threads occupying the top edge of each whorl. The base of the shell is covered by about fourteen rounded ridges and furrows, which are rather stronger toward the center, the last one, forming the edge of the umbilicus, being specially so. Color: The surface is a dead slightly creamy white, formed by a thin calcareous layer through which the underlying nacre shines. The spire is high and conical. The apex broken. The 8 whorls (reckoning the first two as broken) show a slow and regular increase till the last, which enlarges rapidly. They are perfectly flat, with an upper and lower border, sharply angulated and carinated at the periphery, slightly convex but still very flat on the base, with a blunted angulated and carinated umbilical edge. The suture is linear, almost invisible, marginated above and below. The aperture is perpendicular, rhomboidal, with the columella and basal edges nearly equal, and the columella and outer lip nearly parallel. The outer lip is sharp and thin, not patulous, not descending, advancing at its junction with the body whorl, then retreating so as to form the broad open sinus, acute angled at the periphery, slightly arched across the base, nicked close to the point of the pillar. The columellar lip is arched, strengthened by a thin pad; reverted on the umbilicus so as to leave a slight groove behind it, it has a slight tooth in front. From the body whorl it bends very much over to the left, so as largely to cover the umbilicus, and then it curves over to the right to join the outer lip on the base at an obtuse angle. The umbilicus is small, oblique edged, funnel-shaped, nearly covered by the columellar lip, contracted within, scored with hair-like lines of growth.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution This species occurs off the mouth of La Plata, Uruguay at a depth of 3,500 m.

The shell has a conoidal shape with elevated spire. The periphery and the base are rounded, perforate and pearly. The outer layer, if present, is very thin and pellucid. The five whorls are very convex and smooth. Only under a strong lens very faint growth striae and microscopic punctuations may be observed. The sutures are well-marked and marginated. The body whorl is rounded, with a convex base and a small perforation, nearly concealed by the columella. The aperture is rounded, slightly angular above and stronger so below. The outer margin is thin and regularly curved The columellar margin is concave, reflected over the small umbilicus, angular near the base, where it joins the basal margin, and slightly protracted there. The thin operculum is horny, with few whorls, and concave at the outer side. The radula has scarcely the length of 1 mm, and is about ⅓ mm in breadth. It has about 20 transverse rows of teeth; the rhachidian tooth is broad, depressed quadrangular with rounded upper angles and pointed basal ones. It has a large reflected cusp with one strong median denticle and two smaller ones on each side. The laterals, one on each side, have a depressed rhombic base, with a reflected margin, ending in a sharp cusp at the proximal side. The other teeth have the characters of being uncini. They are long, slender and hooked, with apparently smooth cusps. The outer ones are shorter, broader, with a few denticles on each side near the top, visible if expanded. The number of uncini is not large, but Schepman could not ascertain the exact number.Schepman 1908-1913, The Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition; Leyden,E. J.

As a custom, it is held at the end of the Buddhist sabbath (Vassa) and is the second most popular festival in Myanmar after Thingyan Festival (New Year Water Festival). Thadingyut festival is the celebration to welcome the Buddha’s descent from the heaven after he preached the Abhidhamma to his mother, Maya, who was reborn in the heaven. Origins Thadingyut, the seventh month of the Myanmar calendar, is the end of the Buddhist sabbath or Vassa. Thadingyut festival lasts for three days: the day before the full moon day, the full moon day (when Buddha descends from heaven) and the day after the full moon day. Buddha's mother, Maya, died seven days after the Buddha was born and then she was reborn in the Trayastrimsa Heaven as a male .Shaw, M. (2006). Buddhist Goddesses of India (pp. 45-46). In order to show the gratitude for motherhood, Buddha preached Abhidhamma to that deva who was his mother for three Lenten months. When he was descending back to the mortal world, Sakra-devanam-indra, the ruler of the Trayastrimsa Heaven, ordered all the saints and evils to make three precious stairways. Those stairways were made of gold, silver and ruby. The Buddha took the middle one with the ruby. The Nats (Deva) came along by the right golden stairways and the Brahmas from the left silver stairways. Celebrations Buddhists celebrate Thadingyut to welcome the Buddha and his disciples by enlightening and festooning the streets, houses and public buildings with colored electric bulbs or candles, which represent those three stairways. During Thadingyut Festival, there are zat pwes (Myanmar musical plays), free movie shows and stage shows on most of the streets around the country. There are also a lot of food stalls, which sell a variety of Myanmar traditional foods and shops, which sell toys, kitchen utensils, and other useful stuff on most of the streets. Sometime people just walk around in those streets just for sightseeing and have fun. Some people like to play with firecrackers and fire balloons. During the festival days, Buddhists usually go to pagodas and monasteries to pay respect to the monks and offer foods. And some Buddhists usually fast on the full moon day. Young people usually pay respect (gadaw) to their parents, teachers, and elderly relative and offer them some fruits and other gifts. Also while paying homage the younger people usually ask for forgiveness from the wrong-doings they have caused upon their parents or the other elderly relatives throughout the year. Traditionally the elders tell their youngsters that they forgive any of their wrongdoings and continue to bless them with good luck and gift some big notes as pocket money. It is also usual for younger siblings to pay homage to their older siblings. In return, the elder ones wish good luck for them and give them some pocket money. Regional traditions *Dawei - Dawei locals hold a thabeik hmyaw pwe (သပိတ်မျှောပွဲ), in which alms bowls filled with offertories (e.g., flowers, water, oil lamps, candles and joss-sticks) are set adrift at sea to Shin Upagutta. *Shwegyin - Shwegyin locals hold a mi hmyaw pwe (မီးမျှောပွဲ), in which colorful oil lanterns are set adrift into the Shwegyin River to Shin Upagutta.

He studied acting at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography between 1954 and 1959, and in 1959 made his film debut in Sergei Kazakov's In the Silence of the Steppe (V stepnoy tishi). In 1964 he starred as the young hero Ivanushka in the fairy-tale film Jack Frost, the role for which he is best known today. Izotov enjoyed a successful film career until 1983, when he was implicated in a scheme hatched by some fellow artists to finance a dacha by illegal means. During the trial, he was defended by many distinguished colleagues, among them Pyotr Glebov, Nikolai Kryuchkov, Oleg Strizhenov, and Marina Ladynina. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to three years in prison. The experience was devastating for the sensitive Izotov, and left him in poor health and psychologically damaged. After his release, he had trouble finding work, and suffered from chronic ill health. In 1999 he was honored as a Meritorious Artist of the Russian Federation. He died in 2003 in Moscow, and was buried in the northern suburb of Khimki. From 1956 to 1980 he was married to Inga Budkevich, a fellow veteran of Alexander Rou's fairy tale films who went on to have a long career in Soviet and Russian cinema.

Q3 2018. Unemployment rates in Spain vary across different regions of the country, but they tend to be higher when compared to other Western European countries. Unemployment rates in Spain rose sharply during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Unemployment was at 8% between 2006 and 2007. Starting in 2008, the Spanish economic crisis caused the rate to rise past 20% in 2010 and 25% in 2012.  Introduction  Spain has one of the highest unemployment rates compared to other OECD countries. The Q4 2017 unemployment rate is 16.6% of labor force. There has been an upward trend since the 1990s, and this trend has historic roots. Unemployment began rising in Francoist Spain during the 1970s. During the Francoist Spain, trade union activism was prohibited and social security benefits of the modern welfare state were lacking. In 1972, 2.7 million jobs in agriculture were replaced by 1.1 million jobs in the public sector, further increasing unemployment. Although unemployment is a problem in other OECD countries such as Italy and Turkey, data shows that the extent of increase and the persistence is much larger in Spain. Moreover, Catholic countries such as Spain often have very low female workers participation rate, resulting in a worsening employment rate as a new generation of women beginning to pursue work. Net employment creation has been negative since 1973, meaning new jobs aren’t being created to sustain development.  Causes  Spain suffers a high level of structural unemployment. Since the economic and financial crisis of the 1980s, unemployment has never dipped below 8%. Spain has the fourth highest unemployment rate in the OECD, after Portugal, Italy, and Greece. One leading cause is an economy based mostly on tourism and building sectors, as well as lack of industry. The most industrialized region is Basque Country (where industry is around 20–25% of its GDP); its unemployment rate is 2.5 times lower than those of Andalusia and the Canary Islands (where industry is only 5–10% of their respective GDP). In the last thirty years, the Spanish unemployment rate has hovered around double the average of developed countries, in times of growth and in times of crisis. From the start of the crisis of the 1990s, unemployment fell from 3.6 million to two million, however that figure stagnated throughout the stable times to the present crisis.  Consequences  Unemployment benefits are high enough in Spain to sustain basic expenses, though special consideration is only given to those in the first year of being unemployed. Those that are unemployed are at the risk of losing their home. According to research data by Amnesty International, thousands of people are being forcibly evicted without alternative accommodation by the state. Among these include approximately 26,800 rental evictions and 17,000 mortgage evictions. As unemployment is rising higher in Spain, there is limited public spending on housing that would grant necessary shelter. Women traditionally are not trained for the workforce, therefore single mothers and survivors of gender violence are particularly affected. This is, however, changing with a rise of women enrolling in higher education. In July 2018, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights upheld a complaint against Spain for not having means of alternative housing for evicted families. Due to high unemployment levels, employed workers are afraid of losing their jobs and are more reluctant to refute existing working conditions. There are reforms being undertaken by the government in Spain to address this, including reduction of temporary work contracts.  Socio- economic consequences  Unemployment reduces household income which in turn diminishes domestic consumption and quality of life. The mental health of the unemployed and their families deteriorates. The emancipation period is extended and consequently the birth rate decreases as it is difficult to start a family with minimal economic guarantees. Social exclusion is triggered, evictions increase, and families start to default on bills for basic utilities such as water, electricity and gas, leading to energy poverty.  Unemployment and inclusion of people with disabilities  There are efforts in Spain to integrate people with disabilities into the workforce. These efforts include a plan to normalize disability in the work environment with training and professional development implementation. According to the survey of the Spanish National Statistics Institute, 8.5% of the Spanish population is disabled. Disability has a correlation with seniority, as more than 34.7% disabled individuals are over 65. According to data, there are more disabled women than disabled men. In general, disabled people have more difficulties carrying out basic activities and due to these economic hardships. Many people argue that government and economic aid is imperative. Unemployment is one of the largest issues the Spanish disabled community faces. More than 87.1% of disabled people that are able to work don't have a job, and often have difficulty finding one due to labor market barriers. Some factors addressing unemployment among the disabled include insufficient education, lack of information, negative attitude from some employers and HR representatives, and insufficient means of transportation or training. While there are measures being taken to promote employment among the disabled, there is still growth in the number of disabled seeking a job. One measure is the Law for Disabled Peoples' Social Integration, which requires companies with over 50 employees to be made up of at least 2 percent disabled workers.  Unemployment rate  Unemployment rates are obtained through a procedure known as the Economically Active Population Survey. It is taken every three months. The survey divides the population of 16 years or older into four groups: * Occupied people: Those who have carried out paid work, as well as those that have jobs but are absent because of illness, strikes or holiday. * Unemployed: are the people that are not occupied, but that they have sought work actively or are waiting to return to work. More exactly, 1) a person is unemployed if he/she is not working and has made specific efforts to find employ during the last four weeks; 2) has been suspended from employment and is waiting to be called new or 3) is waiting to occupy a job the following month. * Inactive: This category includes the percentage of adult population that is studying, does household chores, is retired, is too sick to work or is simply not looking for work. * Active Population: includes persons who are both employed and the unemployed. The unemployment rate is calculated as the number of unemployed workers divided into the active population, and is expressed as a percentage. In other words, it is not a proportion between the total of the unemployed people and the total population, but economically active people. Women in the economy In Francoist Spain, women found themselves living under a conservative gender ideology, where they were viewed as being consumers and producers of the market economy. Under the authoritarian system of the Spanish State, nationalistic pride situated women in a role meant to serve best the state and the nation, which consisted in the domestic work of nurturing and caring for children. If these roles steered outside the household, they were best funneled through the work sector of teaching and nursing. The culture of Spain, with its fluctuation of political leadership, visibly demonstrates the fluctuation of sovereignty for women’s rights in the country. Between 1931-1936, the Second Republic generated legislation for women granting them new rights of which they were deprived of before. During this period of time, European countries were experiencing a movement towards the equalization of the sexes, which was reflected in the constitution of the New Republic. The constitution extensively accorded women legitimate status under laws on civil marriage and divorce. With the Spanish Coup of July 1936, legal measures that progressed women into the social and economic sector of equal access into the labor market became restricted once again, under the desire of restricting women to the confines of the private sphere of domestic work. The period of transition to democracy carved the way for the reemergence of women in social and economic participation. A revival of sorts for women took initiative in the late 1970s, with the re-emergence of legality in the social atmosphere of Spain; in particular to the restoration of free and equal access to work and right to hire. With women being able to return to the workplace, a significant shift took place in relation to the family life. Domestic life for women was shifting away from normality and into career pursuits. During La Transicion, participation rates in the labor force steadily grew due to structural shifts in education, and birth rates decreased which caused an increased rate in 1975 of 30.20, followed by 34.71 in 1982, and 41.20 in 1986. In addition to the progression of women in the workforce, the elimination of Franco’s “Fuero del Trabajo” in 1938, which enforced the replacement of women workers with men, serves as a reminder of how far woman have come in terms of women’s active role in the economic development of Spain. Although progress has been made, it is still from being considered a pure gender equal state. A wage gap exists in Spain, where in 2005, women residing in Spain earned 72 percent less than men did. Due to legislation better serving opportunities for women, this once marginalized group has seen progress within the country of Spain, but not to the extent of full equality. On March 8, 2018, Spain underwent a 24-hour strike on International Women’s Day, where women were backed by unions in support of gender equality between women and men. Roughly 5.3 million people went on strike. This was representative of both male and female participation, because Spain’s union laws prohibit strikes if they only apply to one of the sexes. The turnout represented 11 percent of the population and 23 percent of the labor force. Justification for the strike appeared to be approved by 82 percent of people. As argued by the participants of the strike (although previous legislation has to an extent helped women), Spain’s public sector still finds that men make an average of 13 percent more than women and 19 percent more than women in the private sector. In 2016, women in the European Union earning gross hourly earnings 16.2 percent below those of their male counterparts on average. According to reports by Eurostat, the “explained” gender gap in Spain is roughly 4 percent in account of variation in characteristics for both women and men in regards to the occupational and sectional segregation in the labor markets.

This paradigm is contrasted with the traditional, information-gathering model of psychological assessment, the main goal of which is to accurately diagnose, plan treatments, and evaluate treatment effectiveness. Traditional, information-gathering assessment is sometimes viewed as the phase before treatment, whereas therapeutic assessment can be considered the first phase of treatment or as a brief standalone treatment. The term 'Therapeutic Assessment' was coined in 1993 by Stephen E. Finn to describe the semi- structured collaborative assessment paradigm developed by himself and colleagues at the Center for Therapeutic Assessment in Austin, Texas. Finn suggests differentiating the capitalized \\"Therapeutic Assessment\\" or the abbreviation, \\"TA\\" as the paradigm developed by himself and his colleagues and the lowercase \\"therapeutic assessment\\" as the more general term which describes a variety of humanistically based assessment models. Research Results of research on therapeutic assessment show that subjects who received therapeutic assessment as opposed to controls (only examiner attention or test without feedback) reported a significant decline in symptomatic distress as well as significant increases in self-esteem and hopefulness, both immediately following the feedback session and at a 2-week follow-up. Research on therapeutic alliance suggests that the use of therapeutic assessment results in a more positive client/assessor relationship than the traditional information-gathering model, which researchers suggest may lead to a decreased therapy drop-out rate. Research has also found that the gains in therapeutic alliance due to therapeutic assessment are related to significantly more positive alliances throughout treatment. A meta-analysis of studies using various forms of assessment as a therapeutic intervention (including TA as outlined by Finn) found that these groups had significantly better outcomes than control or comparison groups. Researchers have also begun to examine therapeutic assessment for children and families, and have demonstrated clinical effectiveness in many settings, including schools, children's hospitals, and various clinics. Training The Therapeutic Assessment Institute (TAI) offers three levels of training for clinicians interested in Therapeutic Assessment, including introductory workshops, intermediate workshops, and advanced training. Stephen E. Finn has also authored a manual on Therapeutic Assessment using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) which breaks the process into three steps. The three steps are the initial interview, preparing for the feedback session (which includes interpreting the MMPI-2 profile), and the feedback session.

Early life  Wanzer was born Lucy Maria Field on October 11, 1841, in Wisconsin, living first in Milwaukee and later in Madison. Her mother had chronic health problems, leading the family to move to California in 1858. Wanzer became an elementary school teacher, and later, after being briefly married, she raised money to attend medical school by learning telegraphy and opening a telegraph office.  Medical school and practice  Wanzer first applied to the Toland Medical College in San Francisco in 1873, but was rejected. In March 1873, the school was absorbed into the University of California system (eventually becoming UCSF), and Wanzer appealed her rejection to the regents of the University of California. She was admitted after a four-month appeal that set a precedent allowing other women to attend medical schools throughout the UC system. While at school, she was hazed by fellow students, and one professor told her any woman who wanted to study medicine should have their ovaries removed, to which she replied that male students should have their testicles removed. She graduated with honors in 1876. After graduation, Wanzer was admitted to the San Francisco County Medical Society, but only after threats to \\"blackball\\" her failed. Her private practice, in a series of downtown San Francisco offices, focused on obstetrics and gynecology. In 1890, she was elected president of the University of California Medical Department Alumni Society. Wanzer was also a practicing pediatrician, and helped establish the San Francisco Children's Hospital. Wanzer continued to practice into her 80s, and died on October 13, 1930, at the age of 89.

Born in the mountainous parish of Saint Thomas, Lasher predominately utilized first rural, and then urban mento styles in his music, although in later years he recorded some ska and reggae singles. Successful and prolific in output, Count Lasher remains an overlooked figure in the history of Jamaican music. Career Count Lasher's career started soon after leaving school. An avid fan of mento music, he taught himself how to play the piano and the guitar before traveling to Kingston where he entertained the tourists on boats moored within Kingston Harbour. A prolific performer, Lasher appeared at hotels, beach parties, charity events, and occasionally in cinemas before the start of the movies. He recorded on several different labels (his debut being produced by Stanley Motta), and was accompanied by various backing bands over the course of his career; early singles are credited to Count Lasher's Seven, with names such as the Royal Calypsonians and Calypso Quartet used later. Though Lasher's music was technically mento in style, Jamaican acts of the era often recorded under calypso-related names as the term 'calypso' had greater recognition amongst tourists. Count Lasher entered some of the music competitions held regularly at Jamaica's Ward's Theatre. On 20 April 1957 the theatre's \\"Federated Calypso Clash\\" saw Trinidadian calypso artists Lord Pretender and Lord Melody battle mento locals Count Lasher and Lord Messam. Count Lasher continued to perform until the mid-1970s, releasing more than fifty songs, yet he never recorded any albums or compilations. Both his age and the spelling of his real nameThe writing credit for \\"Sam Fi Man\\" is given to Terence Perkins, but the Lasher Disc single \\"Natta Bay Road\\" / \\"Female Boxer\\" gives the credit to Terrence Parkins are still open to question, and despite believing that he could be the greatest of all the mento performers, musicologist Michael Garnice has also stated that: \\"Count Lasher may be the single most neglected artist in the history of Jamaican recorded music.\\"  Subject matter  Early recordings released by mento artists were primarily intended for use on the island's sound systems, only later being released to the general public. Like most of the mento songwriters, Count Lasher is a storyteller and social-commentator as well as an entertainer. Colorful local dialect is also employed liberally throughout Lasher's work, with themes and issues easily recognizable to the island's inhabitants. The chorus in \\"Mango Time\\" presents a list of mango cultivars: More Jamaican idioms are to be found in Lasher's arrangement of traditional song \\"The Weed\\" (aka \\"Man Pyabba\\"), which tells of a hungry man encountering an old lady with a basket packed with different medicinal herbs. The protagonist in the story is offered a bewildering array of herbs, with unusual local names such as: 'Tomtom Callback', 'Deadman get-up', 'Granny Back Bone', 'Granny Crack Cracks', 'Guzzu Weed', 'Puss in Boots', and the 'Ducky Batty'. Lasher laments that, \\"The only one she didn't have was the wicked 'Ganja Weed'..\\" Many mento acts used suggestive lyrics in their work, and with a name like \\"Count Lasher\\" (local slang for a Don Juan-like character), it is unsurprising that Perkins recorded several 'saucy' numbers. \\"The Man with the Tool\\", \\"Female Boxer\\", \\"The Ole Man's Drive\\", and \\"Water The Garden\\" are examples of songs where double-entendres are gleefully employed by Count Lasher. Sometimes the subtext is only thinly-veiled, for instance in \\"Robusta Banana\\": In \\"Maintenance\\" Count Lasher recounts a tale of having been sued for child support, when he is adamant that the baby does not belong to him. The baby is white, and Lasher notes how: \\"I'm black, you think, and [the mother] is closely related to ink\\". After he is told that the baby is white because the mother drank Milk of Magnesia when pregnant, Lasher retorts: \\"..put me in jail if you like, I ain't paying.. ..For me to mind a child, well you have to know, that the scamp must be born singing calypso\\".\\"Maintenance\\", Count Lasher (Bongo Man Records) Many other subjects were examined by Lasher in his work. The West Indian passion for cricket is documented in tunes like \\"Final Test Decision\\" and \\"Tribute To Sobers\\", and in \\"Trek to England\\" Lasher angrily commented on the West Indian emigration boom of the time. He felt that the local 'gals' had been made 'vicious' by their obsession with obtaining enough money to purchase a ticket to the country. Covers Count Lasher's \\"Calypso Cha Cha\\" was covered and renamed \\"Rocking Steady\\" by Bob Marley.

She had an interest in art beginning in her teenage years, but her parents sent her to Oberlin College hoping that she would develop another interest. After three years, and at the urging of one of her teachers, Preston's parents allowed her to return to New York and attend the Art Students League. She then studied in Paris with James Whistler and next at the New York School of Art with William Merritt Chase. Following the death of her first husband, Thomas Henry Watkins, Preston embarked on a career as an illustrator to support herself. She socialized and exhibited with artists of the Ashcan School and married one of the group, James Moore Preston, in 1903. They traveled to Europe together, summered on Long Island, and co-illustrated a magazine story. She became a successful illustrator for magazines, like Harper's Bazaar and The Saturday Evening Post, and was a successful book illustrator. Considered one of the top women illustrators between 1900 and 1940, Preston was one of the few female members and exhibitors of the Society of Illustrators, having been admitted March 29, 1904 after peers Florence Scovel Shinn, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Violet Oakley, and Jessie Willcox Smith. Like them, she was only an Associate Member since full membership was not allowed for women until the 1920s.Michele H. Bogart, Artists, Advertising, and the Borders of Art, University of Chicago Press: 1995 She exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show and won a medal at the Panama–Pacific Exposition in 1915. Preston was one of the major suffrage artists. Her works are in a number of museum collections. She played herself a chapter of the film serial Our Mutual Girl that was shown in theaters in 1915. Early life Mary Wilson was born on August 28, 1873 in New York City. She was the only child, of Ann Taylor Wilson and John J. Wilson. Preston was one of the founders of the country's oldest women's fine arts organization, the Women's Art Club, at the age of 16. Education She was a \\"high spirited girl\\" whose parents tried to dissuade her from becoming and artist and sent her to Oberlin College in 1889. Preston was there until 1892, when one of her teachers convinced her parents to allow their \\"irrepressible\\" daughter to study art. She studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1892 through 1897 under William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri and John Henry Twachtman. She objected when, as a female, she was not allowed to attend life drawing classes. Preston studied in Paris with James Whistler. She studied under Chase again at the New York School of Art in 1901. She met Edith Dimock and another art student, Lou Seyme there. After the three moved into the Sherwood Studios on 57th Street, they became known as the \\"Sherwood Sisters\\" for the weekly open house they held at their studio, noted for its \\"fun and high jinks\\". Marriage In 1898 she married Thomas Henry Watkins, who died in 1900. In 1903 May Wilson Watkins married artist James Moore Preston, who was one of the artists in the urban realism group called the Ashcan School with George Luks, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, and Robert Henri. Her roommate Dimock married one of the original Ashcan School painters, William J. Glackens. The two couples spent summers together from 1911 to 1917 in Bellport on Long Island and took trips together to Europe. May and James traveled to France often. In New York, they frequented Cafe Francis and Mouquin's with a group of fellow artists. In 1935, the Prestons moved to East Hampton, New York. The Prestons did not have any children. Career May Wilson Preston, Dejeuner, circa 1910, oil on canvas, Barnes Foundation After her first husband's death, she supported herself by working as an illustrator. Unsure of her talent, she approached a magazine with trepidation. When asked by the editor why she brought her drawings to them, Preston said, \\"Because, I am a beginner and thought that this was the worst magazine I had ever seen.\\" He bought a sketch, with a smile on his face. Preston began illustrating in 1900 and the following year her works were published in Harper's Bazaar. From \\"People who interest us: May Wilson Preston, Illustrator of Real Life\\" in The Craftsman (1910): At the turn of the century there was a movement to incorporate greater realism in illustrations. Preston was one of the artists who effectively followed the lead of William Glackens, George Luks and Everett Shinn. She was considered one of the top woman illustrators between 1900 and 1939. Others were Elizabeth Shippen Green, Jessie Willcox Smith, and Violet Oakley. Preston became the first, and for years the only, woman to be an associate member and exhibitor at the Society of Illustrators. In 1920, the four top women illustrators and society's associate members became full members when the Society of Illustrators was incorporated. Preston also showed her work with the artists of the informal Ashcan School. She was one of the major suffrage artists, as were Nina E. Allender and Rose O'Neill. Preston was one of the postcard artists for the movement. From 1902 to 1915, it was a pastime of many Americans to collect postcards. She was a judge to select artwork for 300 billboard across the state of New York. John French Sloan and F. Luis Mora were the other judges. Preston was a co-illustrator with her husband, James Moore Preston, on the \\"Our Horse\\" story printed in a 1910 edition of Everybody's Magazine. The landmark Armory Show of 1913 included one of Preston's oil paintings, Girl with print. She won an award at the Panama–Pacific Exposition in 1915. In New York, she exhibited at the MacDowell Club. Preston played herself in the movie Our Mutual Girl which was shown in theaters in 1915. In 1920, Preston illustrated two F. Scott Fitzgerald stories for The Saturday Evening Post: Bernice Bobs Her Hair and Myra Meets His Family. She also illustrated stories published in the Post by Mary Roberts Rinehart. Her drawings illustrated articles by Ring Lardner and P. G. Wodehouse. Later years Her career was essentially over after contracting a skin infection that made it difficult for her to paint and as a result of the dwindling market during the Depression. She died on May 18, 1949 in East Hampton on Long Island, New York. Her husband, James Moore Preston, died in 1962.

Note that the initial formation does not have to be straight. The term was introduced by S. Warren Carey in 1955 in a paper setting forth how complex shapes of various orogenic belts could be explained by actual bending, and that understanding this provided \\"the key to understanding the evolution of the continents\\".. Carey showed that in a dozen cases where such bends were undone the results were substantially identical with continental reconstructions deduced by other means.. Recognition of oroclinal bending provided strong support to the subsequent theory of plate tectonics. Examples A composite relief image of South America.

The orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the Altiplano Plateau according to Isacks (1988) the orocline is related to crustal shortening.

Lyrics \\"Once again all lyrics were composed by Giorgia Gueglio, \\"I started the lyrics with the intention of writing a concept album with the title \\"Metals\\", concerning metals in metallurgy, chemistry, alchemy and magic. But during their creation I found my lyrics full of sentiments, suffering and emotions. So \\"Metals\\" became too cold. Many tracks have a title with a metal within, but these are \\"warmed\\" by blood, my/our human warmth, the passion of making music in a difficult world. So the album title was changed to \\"On Fire\\". 'O Fire' is a hot work, very human. On the front cover (also created by Giorgia) you can see a metal hearth. It represents our body that became real and can be hot or burn thanks to our emotions\\".\\".

It is delivered only in a secret consistory at which the cardinals alone are present. Among the ancient Romans, an allocutio was a speech made by a commander to his troops, either before a battle or during it, to animate and encourage them. The term when adopted into ecclesiastical usage retained much of its original significance. An allocution of the Pope often takes the place of a manifesto when a struggle between the Holy See and the secular powers has reached an acute stage. It then usually summarizes the points at issue and details the efforts made by the Holy See to preserve peace. It likewise indicates what the Pope has already conceded and the limit which principle obliges him to put to further concessions. A secret consistory of cardinals, as opposed to a public and ceremonious one, is a meeting in the presence of the Pope to discuss matters of great importance concerning the well-being of the Church. At these secret consistories, the Pope not only creates cardinals, bishops, and legates, but he also discusses with the cardinals grave matters of State arising out of those mixed affairs, partly religious, partly civil, in which conflict can easily arise between Church and State. In such secret consistories the cardinals have a consultative vote. When the Pope has reached a conclusion on some important matter, he makes his mind known to the cardinals by means of a direct address, or allocution. Such allocutions, though delivered in secret, are usually published for the purpose of making clear the attitude of the Holy See on a given question. They treat generally of matters that affect the whole Church, or of religious troubles in a particular country where ecclesiastical rights are infringed or endangered, or where heretical or immoral doctrines are undermining the faith of the people. Most of the subjects presented to the secret consistory have already been prepared in the consistorial congregation, which is composed of a limited number of cardinals. These conclusions may be accepted or rejected by the Pope as he thinks proper. In matters of statecraft the Pontiff also takes counsel with those most conversant with the subject at issue and with his Secretary of State. His conclusions are embodied in the allocution. Among papal allocutions of later times which attracted widespread attention from the importance or delicacy of the matters with which they dealt, may be mentioned those of Pius VII on the French Concordat of 1801 and on the difficulties created by Napoleon for the Holy See (1808); those of Gregory XVI referring to the troubles with Prussia concerning mixed marriages, and with Russia over forcible conversions to the Greek Church, considered schismatic by the Catholic Church; those of Pius IX concerning the attacks on the Pope's temporal power, and of Pius X on the rupture with France occasioned by the breaking of the Concordat and the consequent separation of Church and State in that country.

It is a geological and botanical reserve, located in the extreme southwest of the Secaşelor Plateau on the right bank of the Secașul Mare, about north of Sebeș. With a size of approximately 24 hectares, the reserve is classified as IUCN Category III. Erosion and runoff has given it a prominent, sharp rocky appearance in the mountainside. Râpa Roșie itself measures approximately 10 hectares in size. Râpa Roșie stretches over a length of . Its height measures between ( absolute altitude). A huge wall, almost vertical, gives the impression of a ruined ancestral monument. Tiered columns and pyramids, separated by ravines, form a badlands microrelief. The first report of a Coţofeni culture find at Râpa Roşie was made by Fr. W. Schuster in 1865. It was the first archaeological exploration made by him which revealed remnants of large and small pottery that had ornamentation, which also attested to the Coţofeni culture. Geology Râpa Roșie is a geological reserve and a natural monument with unusual red bed features. Assessing the geological age of the formations has been a daunting task as no fossil remains had been found in the past. The geological monument has been called a \\"natural wonder\\". Its walls rise to a height of 80-100m. Rock formations are naturally carved with very unusual shapes of columns, towers and pyramids formed over centuries of erosion by rainwater. Study of the feature has revealed geological formations of gravel, quartz sands, and sandstones. The deposits are distinct \\"succession of red clays, grey and reddish soap-stones, friable white soap-stone.\\" They all exhibit a reddish colour. Deep ravines are formed and during the rainy season the water flowing in the deep ravines is in the colour of the formation that is red; as the water falls into the ravines it makes a roaring sound. Râpa Roșie River flows in the vicinity. Flora Râpa Roșie There are many rare and endemic plants in the area. The floral species reported from the park are Cotoneaster integerrimus, Ephedra distachya, Centaurea atropurpurea, Dianthus serotinus, Cephalaria radiate, and Asplenium nigrum. To evolve a management plan for the natural reserve, a study was carried out on the flora and faunal resources within the reserve area. Given this data, the details of flora reported are 144 plant species of 41 families. Of these, 8 are endangered species which are characteristic to the ecoregion of the xerophilous grasslands and/or the Xerothermic subcontinental Oak forest, and are: Cephalaria radiate, Cephalaria uralensis, Onosma pseudoarenaria, Jurinea mollis ssp. (transsilvanica), Salvia transsilvanica, Salvia nutans, Centaurea atropurpurea and Quercus pubescens. In addition to the above, some rare plant species reported are Cotoneaster integerrimus, Centaurea atropurpurea, Dianthus serotinus, Cephalaria radiata and Asplenium adiantum-nigrum. Fauna To draw up a management plan for the natural reserve, a study was carried out on the flora and faunal resources within the reserve area. ;Avifauna * Alauda arvensis (sky lark) * Accipiter gentilis (goshawk) * Aegithalos caudatus (long tailed tit) * Buteo buteo (common buzzard) * Carduelis carduelis (European goldfinch) * Carduelis chloris (Greenfinch) * Coccothraustes sp.

The investigations were started in 1969. Dinosaur bones were reported in earlier investigations. Based on the investigations carried out by Codrea and Dica in 2005, they have assigned the age of these formations to the Early Miocene age (also conjectured as of Eggenburgian-Ottnangian age). Some of the rare fossils found here are vertebrates; one of these is of sauropod caudal vertebra. This fossil's original source is interpreted as the underlying Şard Formation of the Maastrichtian-Priabonian, which has eroded over the years. Paleontologists involved with the studies at Râpa Roșie have opined that this is the only sauropod genus reported at any time in the latest Cretaceous Maastrichtian) formations in Romania, which could be stated as Magyarosaurus.

It represents the British sports media on the British Olympic Association's press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. Its President is the veteran broadcaster and columnist Sir Michael Parkinson. Membership is open to journalists, photographers, broadcasters, reporters, editors, and cartoonists. However, in order to obtain a full membership you have to be a journalist based in the United Kingdom.  History  The Association was founded in 1948, as the Sports Writers' Association. Following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive Sports Journalists' Association. Furthermore, the SJA worked alongside the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. Being the driving force behind its development, the recognition that the Commonwealth Games brought to the Sports Journalists Association helped SJA to become known in the sport of Rugby. Since then, the SJA has been very successful. In 2012, the Sports Journalists' Association was fortunate to be included within the 10,000 other colleagues involved at the Olympics in London. The SJA hosts the oldest sports awards ceremony in Britain, which began in 1949. The SJA British Sports Awards essentially honors the outstanding journalists and their work within the field. Ladbrokes, The National Lottery, and BT Sports are all companies who support and sponsor events hosted by the SJA.  Awards  It stages two prestigious awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognises outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's \\"Oscars\\", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. In March 2008, Martin Samuel, then the chief football correspondent of The Times, was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had managed to win the award three years in succession. At the same awards, Jeff Stelling, of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the Sunday Times's Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.  Events  The Sports Journalists' Association holds events that cover various causes. Whether they are social or informative events, the SJA plays an important role in sports media. Members are welcomed to participate and enjoy activities involving horse racing, golf, and cricket. For those not interested in social events like so, they're open to join in on a Masterclass. By attending one of these masterclasses, information will be shared by leading sports journalists that may possibly enhance the skills of a sports journalist.  British Sports Journalism Awards  As discussed by the British Sports Journalists' Association (SJA), the Awards hosted involve the commemorating of all sports writers. Whether they are involved in daily, weekly, regional, or national newspapers, news agencies, websites and specialist magazines are all subject to win. * The John Bromley Sportswriter of the Year award * The Ed Lacey Trophy for the Sports Photographer of the Year * The Sports Newspaper of the Year * The Doug Gardner Award * Sports Newspaper of the Year * Broadcast Sports Presenter * Broadcast Journalist * Television Sport Live Broadcast * Radios Sport Live Broadcast * Television Sport Documentary * Radio Sport Documentary * Best Special Package * Laureus Sports Website * Specialist Sports Website * Sports Scoop * Ladbrokes Specialist Correspondent * Investigative Sports Reporter * Sports Columnist * Sports Feature Writer * Sports News Reporter * Cricket Writer * Football Writer * Rugby Writer * Regional Writer * Young Sports Writer * David Welch Student Sports Writer * Sports Picture * Sports Portfolio * Specialist Sports Portfolio * Sports News Picture  British Sports Awards  The British Sports Awards is an award ceremony that the Sports Journalists' Association holds to honor all notable men and woman athletes.

It was released by Blue Note Records on March 7, 2006, and peaked at number 22 in the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart. The album is titled Solo since no additional performers were included on the recording as in Rubalcaba's previous albums. Also produced by Rubalcaba, Solo was released following his second collaborative work with Charlie Haden on the album Land of the Sun, which resulted in a Grammy Award for Haden. The album includes fifteen tracks and met with mostly positive reviews by critics, most commenting on the ability of the performer and the simplicity of the arrangements. The album was nominated for a Billboard Latin Music Award, and won the Latin Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album. Background and release Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba recorded Solo following his collaboration with Charlie Haden on Land of the Sun, an album featuring songs written by Mexican composer José Sabre Marroquin and arranged by Rubalcaba, a sequel to Nocturne (2001), another collaboration between them. Haden and Rubalcaba were awarded the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album for both albums. Solo was the first solo album (not featuring guest musicians) released by the performer in twenty years.

There are four improvised tracks inspired by John Coltrane's Giant Steps: \\"Paseo Iluminado\\", \\"Paseo en Media Luz\\", \\"Paseo Azul\\", and \\"Paseo Morado\\". \\"Iluminado (Improv #1)\\", according to Roberto R. Calder of PopMatters, has \\"stock phrasing, but a pause in concentration before the sublime quality of a one-minute lullaby worth waiting for\\"; \\"Media Luz (Improv #2)\\" \\"hints at jazz with concert-room sonorities and a striking ending\\"; \\"Azul (Improv #3)\\" \\"proceeds with more consistent direction than its two predecessors\\" and becomes a hymn\\"; and \\"Morado (Improv #4)\\" \\"develops into long linear passages for each hand.\\" \\"Faro\\" is a track with \\"a simple ostinato bass, a transition section and a loud climax.\\" The opening track, \\"Rezo\\", is an interlude inspired by the work of French composer Claude Debussy and American performer Duke Ellington, and is \\"based on Afro-Cuban melodies sung during Santería rites.\\" \\"Silencio\\" is a tribute to Cuban boleros. \\"Prologo (Prologue to a Fantasy)\\" features a \\"congenial intellectual playfulness alternating between something like Spanish piano music of a century ago, and the dance-hall.\\" \\"Bésame Mucho\\" was first included on the 1991 album The Blessing, Rubalcaba's first recording to be issued in the United States, and the version was named by Scott Yanow of AllMusic a \\"highlight\\" of the album, including accompaniment from Haden on bass guitar and drummer Jack DeJohnette. A reworked version is included on Solo, and is described as having an \\"intensely meditative character and slow deliberation,\\" and \\"a more complex higher level of communication\\" than the original version. \\"Here's That Rainy Day\\" is a jazz ballad, recorded earlier for the album Inner Voyage, with an arrangement described as \\"breathtaking\\" by Ken Dryden of Allmusic. The first version of \\"Quasar\\" can be found on Paseo (2004); and the version included on Solo is described as \\"seven minutes of drama,\\" by Calder of PopMatters, with \\"a sprawling, improv-heavy composition that runs Rubalcaba up and down the keyboard.\\" Reception Solo received mostly positive reviews from critics. Andrew Liengard of Jazz Houston stated that Rubalcaba played \\"at once a pyrotechnical and thunderous two-handed assault, he also demonstrates a profound awareness of space and dynamics,\\" and finally called the album \\"stunning\\".

Calder stated that the record was \\"a very remarkable solo piano recital.\\" David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer \\"is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work.\\" Miller also suggested that \\"Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings. He still has time to become a great solo artist, and this writer has every confidence that he will.\\" In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba \\"finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait for this moment, and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately he lights an inspiring fire.\\" Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdés, asseverating that both performers \\"blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction.\\" Timothy Sprinkle of Jazz Review declared that the performer \\"carries the disc with a light, breezy ease that's surprising, especially given all of the slow selections.\\" Solo peaked at number 22 in the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart and was nominated for \\"Latin Jazz Album of the Year\\" at the 18th Annual Billboard Latin Music Awards, losing to Around the City by Eliane Elias.

Headed by pioneer Canadian socialist Ernest Burns, the SDPBC was a key constituent group behind the formation of the Social Democratic Party of Canada in 1911. Organisational history Background Prior to the formation of the Socialist Party of British Columbia in 1901, socialists in the Canadian province of British Columbia were split into approximately five small local groups, professing allegiance to several fledgling national organisations located outside the province.Martin Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour. Kingston, ON: Industrial Relations Centre, Queen's University, 1968; pg. 40. In an effort to unify these scattered forces, a unity convention was held and the Vancouver-based Socialist Party of British Columbia (SPBC) was founded. A strong American influence marked the new organisation, reflected in the group's leading personnel and programme. Chief provincial organiser of the SPBC was Ernest Burns, formerly an activist in the Social Democratic Federation in Great Britain before moving to North America where he organised for the People's Party and the Socialist Party in Washington.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pp. 40-41. The reform-oriented programme of the Socialist Party of America was adopted wholesale by the new Canadian group.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 41. The initial moderate orientation of the SPBC proved unsatisfactory for the revolutionary socialist local organisation in Nanaimo, however, which soon broke from the SPBC to form the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Canada. Pressure was brought to bear to radicalise the party and in January 1902 at the second annual convention of the SPBC the Socialist Party of America's programme was scrapped and a new impossibilist document eliminating all \\"immediate demands\\" was adopted.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pp. 41-42. A reunification of the SPBC and the Revolutionary Socialist Party followed later that same year.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 42. At the 1904 convention of the SPBC this organisation expanded its horizons, christening itself the Socialist Party of Canada (CPC), although remaining in practice a British Columbia- dominated group.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 100. This move to the left created a new layer of discontent, however, as so-called constructive socialists sought to shift the organisation's orientation from largely ineffectual radical propaganda to electoral politics. It was this disagreement over the programme and policies of the CPC which fueled a 1907 split and the formation of a new organisation known as the Social Democratic Party of British Columbia. Formation Formation of the Social Democratic Party of British Columbia was guided by Socialist Party founder Ernest Burns, who led a formal split from the CPC in May 1907.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 104.

Biography Giovanni Gioia was grandson of the industrialist Filippo Pecoraino and had kinship relationships with Tagliavia shipowners. Gioia was one of the most influential members of Amintore Fanfani's political faction within Christian Democracy in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954 Gioia was appointed provincial secretary of the Christian Democracy of Palermo and also head of the Party Organization Office, which supervised the membership cards: Gioia inaugurated the so-called \\"card strategy\\", which consisted in the distribution of membership cards to relatives, friends and even to the dead, arriving to open 59 Christian Democratic sections only in Palermo. Around the years 1954-1957 the breakdown of the agrarian bloc allowed Gioia to transfer liberal and monarchist exponents (often compromised with the mafia) to the Christian Democrats. The two main lieutenants of Gioia, Salvo Lima and Vito Ciancimino, managed to reach the top of the municipal administration of Palermo: during the period of the city council of the mayor Lima and the assessor for public works Ciancimino (1958-1964), 1,600 of 4,000 building permits appeared in the name of three figureheads, who had nothing to do with building, inaugurating the season of the so-called \\"Sack of Palermo\\".La mafia urbana - Documenti della Commissione Parlamentare Antimafia VI LEGISLATURA During this period, the builder Francesco Vassallo (son-in-law of Giuseppe Messina, head of the Tommaso Natale village and one of the protagonists of the Sack of Palermo) managed to obtain numerous loans issued without guarantee by the Cassa di Risparmio, chaired by Gaspare Cusenza. , father-in-law of Gioia; according to their relationships, the families of Gioia and Cusenza went to live in the numerous apartments built by Vassallo. In 1958 Gioia was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, being re-elected for five other terms. In 1966 he was appointed Undersecretary for Finance in the third Moro government and re- confirmed in the second Leone government, in office from 24 June 1968 to 12 December 1968. Giovanni Gioia was also national deputy secretary of the Christian Democracy from 22 January 1969 to November 22, 1969. Subsequently he served as Minister of Post and Telecommunications in the second Andreotti government (1972–73), as Minister for Parliamentary Relations in the fourth and fifth Rumor governments (1973–74) and as Minister of Merchant Navy in the fourth and fifth Moro governments (1974–76).Government posts Controversies Pasquale Almerico case In 1957 Pasquale Almerico, secretary of the Christian Democratic section of Camporeale, denied the membership card to Vanni Sacco, head of the local mafia gang. Almerico decided to inform with a memorial the secretary of the Sicilian DC, Nino Gullotti, and Giovanni Gioia, in his role as provincial secretary of the DC and head of the Organization Office, but received no response: on March 25, 1957 Almerico was barbarously murdered in Camporeale. Gioia welcomed the mobster of Camporeale into the ranks of the DC and replied to the accusations of abandoning Almerico to his fate of violent death saying that \\"The party needs people to join forces, needs new men, some cannot be impeded compromise attempts\\". In 1958 the Palermo newspaper L'Ora denounced the responsibilities of Gioia and the leaders of the local DC for the murder of Pasquale Almerico. So Gioia immediately sued the newspaper. Subsequently the complaint was withdrawn after the publication of a denial agreed between the complainant and the journalists involved. The investigation of the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission In the early 70s, Gioia was investigated by the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission for his links with the builder Vassallo (The Court of Palermo has excluded that Vassallo had links with the mafia, a decision confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Potenza with a decree of May 24, 1974) and with mafia members. Finally in 1976 the minority report of the Anti-Mafia Parliamentary Commission, also drafted by the deputies Pio La Torre and Cesare Terranova, severely accused Gioia and his lieutenants Vito Ciancimino and Salvo Lima of having relations with the mafia.Relazione di minoranza della Commissione Parlamentare Antimafia VI LEGISLATURA The ISAB Case of Melilli Regarding the establishment of the ISAB company in Melilli, the name of Giovanni Gioia was included in a significant list of bribes distributed as stated in various newspaper articles.

The tractor was technically capable but overpriced taking into account its characteristics.  Background  The Takra factory was located in Nekala, Tampere. The company was started as a bus operator but began producing spare parts for vehicles during World War II. After the war the company produced mechanical and belt conveyors, which were produced for war reparations to Soviet Union. The production was relatively large-scaled; the number of personnel was 300 and turnover 188 million marks in 1948.  Planning  After the war, there was a severe shortage of tractors in Finland, and in 1946 Takra made the decision to start tractor production. At the beginning of 1947 the Technical Manager of the company Aulis A. Lumme was assigned to make plans for a tractor. The first prototype was ready in spring 1948 and a year later it was exhibited in the 40th anniversary celebration of Kangasala Farmers' Society. The event was also reported on Helsingin Sanomat, the main newspaper of Finland.  Production  The first sample series of six units was produced in June 1949 and one of them was sent for testing to the State Agricultural Machinery Research Institute (Vakola). Several improvements were made after the feedback. The sales representation was granted to Suomen Maanviljelijäin Kauppa Oy (SMK), which also sold McCormick tractors. In June 1950 Takra was on display in Tampere fair at SMK stand, where it got a lot of visibility – the number of visitors during the fair was 115 000\\\\. After this Takra was shown in Savo fair in Varkaus. Serial production was started in 1950 and the company reported producing over 100 units. However, due to strikes in metal industry, just 30 tractors were produced by the following February. This led to doubts on Takra's production capabilities, and the company management tried to convince the public by telling that the production capacity will be increased as soon as the war reparations will be paid off. Eventually, the price of Takra tractors had climbed higher than estimated and it was clearly more expensive than its foreign competitors. The production volume in 1951 was reportedly 100 tractors, the following year's production is estimated to be 200. The only bottleneck at this stage were the raw material constraints. The company also designed and produced agricultural machinery compatible with Takras. At the same time there was a critical shortage of tractors in Finland; the estimated gap was 10 000–15 000 tractors and the domestic production was hardly worth mentioning. Therefore, the government was under pressure to remove the import restrictions. At the end of 1951 the tractor importing was released for a few months, during which a lot of tractors of various makes were quickly transported into the country. Construction of a new Takra factory was started in spring 1953 and the production was moved into the new facilities at late winter 1954. By then the production rate had reached already one tractor per day and in the new facilities it went up to eight tractors per week. It seemed realistic to increase the annual volume up to level of 500–600 tractors; a larger number was estimated reachable by help of subcontractors. The production costs were hoped to be decreased as and when the volumes increased. However, the artificially overvalued rate of the Finnish mark and price dumping of the foreign tractors created problems. For example, Fordson Major cost about 500 000 marks in Sweden whereas the price in Finland was just 390 000 marks. The new Takra factory did not stay operative very long, until the company owner, Väinö Paunu, decided to discontinue the production. The factory was sold to the city of Tampere. Officially the Takra tractor production totalled 880 pieces. According to the documents of the authorities the number was about hundred units smaller. The last Takras were sold from SMK's stock in 1955.  Technical data and characteristics  The power source is Waukesha paraffin engine with an output of 26 horsepower. The transmission consists four ratios. The tractor is equipped with three-point linkage. The kerb weight is 1 740 kg. Takra's output corresponded Fordson Major. During Vakola tests it could easily pull with a third gear a spade roller harrow with 25 rollers. When equipped with wheel chains, Takra could pull a two-furrow plough with 14\\" wings through medium hard soil. The tractor was evaluated as easy to use and maintain, and structurally and characteristically suitable for general agricultural use. An ideal farm size for Takra were places with about 40 hectares of field and therefore its market potential looked good. Takra was considered suitable also to forestry work. Takra's stumbling block was its price. In December 1951 a Takra with electrical starter, hydraulic three-point linkage, pulley for stationary use, power take-off and headlights was 665 000 marks; for example Fordson Major cost then just 351 500 marks. On the other hand, Takra was also available without the mentioned accessories, which lowered its price.

City of Tampa, Fla., 265 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 2001), decided on September 21, 2001, was a case decided by the 11th Circuit Court, in which the court decided whether on online site called Voyeur Dorm fit the Tampa City Code definition of an \\"adult entertainment establishment.\\" The circuit court was unanimous in its decision.  Facts  Voyeur Dorm, located at 2312 West Farwell Drive, Tampa, was a Florida company which operated a website that allowed members to watch the lives of the residents 24 hours a day for $34.95 a month. The women who were employed by Voyeur Dorm signed contracts which stated that they were employees on a \\"stage and filming location.\\" Subscribers could also pay an additional $16.00 each month to chat with the women. From August 1998 to June 2000, Voyeur Dorm generated $3,166,551.35 from subscriptions and sales. Upon learning that local law enforcement were investigating the business in 1998, Voyeur Dorm wrote to Tampa's Zoning Coordinator to inquire about whether the City Code applied to the activities at 2312 West Farwell Drive. The Zoning Coordinator issued the following decision: > It is my determination that the use occurring at 2312 W. Farwell Dr., as > described in your letter, is an adult use. Section 27-523 defines adult > entertainment as: \\"Any [sic] premises, except those businesses otherwise > defined in this chapter, on which is offered to members of the public or any > person, for a consideration, entertainment featuring or in any way including > specified sexual activities, as defined in this section, or entertainment > featuring the displaying or depicting of specified anatomical areas, as > defined in this section; 'entertainment' as used in this definition shall > include, but not be limited to, books, magazines, films, newspapers, > photographs, paintings, drawings, sketches or other publications or graphic > media, filmed or live plays, dances or other performances distinguished by > their display or depiction of specified anatomical areas or specified > anatomical activities, as defined in this section.\\" Please be aware that the > property is zoned RS-60 Residential Single Family, and an adult use business > is not permitted use.

Holding  The circuit court found that Voyeur Dorm did not fit the Tampa City Code section 27-523. Judge Dubina wrote that \\"the offering occurs when the videotaped images are dispersed over the Internet and into the public eye for consumption. The City Code cannot be applied to a location that does not, itself, offer adult entertainment to the public.\\" 265 F.3d at 1236 Since the public cannot physically go to 2312 West Farwell Drive to see the adult entertainment, it does not fall under the Tampa zoning ordinance.

The event took place on November 13, 2011 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico, Mexico, IWRG's main venue. The main event of the show was the eponymous La Gran Cruzada tournament, which was 30-man Battle Royal with the winner being named the number one contender for the Rey del Ring Championship and would receive a match against Rey del Ring Champion Pantera at a later date. Production Background In 2011 the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) started to award a championship belt to the winner of their annual Rey del Ring (\\"King of the Ring\\") tournament that could be defended between the annual tournaments. As a result IWRG also added an annual La Gran Cruzada (\\"The Great Crusade\\") tournament about half way between the Rey del Ring tournaments. Like the Rey del Ring the eponymous Gran Cruzada match is a 30-man elimination match similar in concept to the WWE's annual Royal Rumble match. The winner of the Gran Cruzada tournament would become the number one contender for the Rey del Ring Championship with a title match at a later date. The La Gran Cruzada shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2011 La Gran Cruzada show was the first time that IWRG promoted a show under that name. Storylines The event featured four professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Iguerbouchen (Francophile name), Mohamed Ygerbuchen (as screen credited), Mohamed Ben Saïd Iquerbouchen, ; (13 November 1907 – 23 August 1966) was an Algerian composer. Early life Mohamed Iguerbouchène was the oldest of 14 children born to Saïd ben Ali and Sik Fatma bent Areski. He attended a primary school in Algiers. For his secondary education, he claimed to have studied music theory at a Norton College, in London. When he was 15, he crossed paths with Earl Fraser Roth, who found himself inspired by the obvious talent of the young Mohamed and decided to help him in his further studies. In 1922, with the generosity of Fraser Ross, Mohamed traveled to Manchester, where he enrolled in the Royal Manchester College of Music. Training Iguerbouchène attended the prestigious Imperial Academy of Music in 1924 in Vienna for one year. In 1925, at the age of 18, he performed his first concert in Bregenz, Lake Constance. He exhibited his talent chaining works of his own directory like Kabylia Rapsodie n. 9 and Arabic rapsodie n. 7. The culmination of his early years of work resulted in his winning his first prize of harmony, counterpoint, and piano instrumentation. In 1934, after several successful symphonies, Mohamed was introduced to the Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique (SACEM) as a songwriter, and in that same year he was also introduced as a member of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD). Iguerbouchène was fluent in 18 languages including Russian and Japanese. In France, at the école normale des langues orientales de Paris, he was a student of Professor Destaing, where he studied Tamahaq, Tachawit and Tashelhit. Career After some time, Iguerbouchène shifted his focus to compose for the cinema as opposed to symphonic music. After a few documentaries (Aziza) and a short film (Dzair), Julien Duvivier asked him to collaborate for the soundtrack of Pépé le Moko, a film whose main role was played by Jean Gabin. This film was the catalyst behind Mohamed's career as a film composer. The two artists shared the composition of the soundtrack in association with Vincent Scotto. (On the film's credits his name appeared as \\"Mohamed Ygerbuchen\\".) In 1938, he met the singer Salim Halali in Paris (who was originally from Annaba), who helped Mohamed to compose fifty songs, mainly in an Arabic Flamenco style. The collaboration was successful in Parisian clubs and they also toured the rest of Europe. They were in particular very popular in North Africa. Following his approach to the BBC, in 1939 it broadcast one of his orchestral works, a 'Moorish Rhapsody', which was conducted by Charles Brill. Charles Brill And His Orchestra,Radio Times, 9 June 1939. Some listeners thought that he was a Russian composer, which earned him the nickname Igor Bouchen. In 1938, he composed songs with Vincent Scotto for the film Algiers. Because of Iguerbouchène's success in music direction, he was hired in 1940 by Paris Mondial to compose music for 20 short films for Mercier Film Inc. film studios. In early 1945, he composed about 100 songs based on poems in Thousands Nights by Rabindranath Tagore. In 1946, he composed music for, Les plongeurs du désert by Tahar Hannache. Later years Iguerbouchène composed for the 1962 French short Le songe de chevaux sauvages, directed by Albert Lamorisse about wild horses in France.

The Armenian whiskered bat was formerly included as a part of the whiskered bat, but was considered distinct in 2000 as a result of morphologic comparison. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new subspecies of the whiskered bat in 1939. In 2000, Benda and Tsytsulina published that it should be considered a full species based on its physical characteristics. In 2016, Dietz et al. argued that the Armenian whiskered bat was not morphologically or genetically distinct enough to be considered a full species; instead, they argued that it is synonymous with Myotis aurascens (which is itself sometimes considered synonymous with Myotis davidii). However, as of 2018 the Integrated Taxonomic Information System still considers the Armenian whiskered bat as a full species. Its species name \\"hajastanicus\\" means \\"of Hayastan,\\" which is an alternate name for Armenia. Description It is relatively large for its genus with a forearm length of approximately . Its fur is brown while the distal tips of individual hairs may have a golden or yellowish tint. Conservation There were no records of the Armenian whiskered bat from the 1980s until 2013 and the species has only ever been located in the Sevan Lake basin in Armenia. In 2013, 11 pregnant Armenian whiskered bats were captured near Lake Sevan. Before the 2013 documentation, it was considered possibly extinct. Due to its imperiled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction.

Rather than take the time to retype the article to use the singular form, or to bring in a co-author, Hetherington decided to invent one. Publications F. D. C. Willard's Signature Hetherington had a Siamese cat named Chester, who had been sired by a Siamese named Willard. Fearing that colleagues might recognize his pet's name, he thought it better to use the pet's initial. Aware that most Americans have at least two given names, he invented two more given names based on the scientific name for a house cat, Felis domesticus, and abbreviated them accordingly as F. D. C. His article, entitled \\"Two-, Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange Effects in bcc ³He\\" and written by J. H. Hetherington and F. D. C. Willard, was accepted by the Physical Review and published in number 35 (November 1975). At the 15th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics in 1978 in Grenoble, Hetherington's co-author was exposed: Hetherington had sent some signed copies of his article to friends and colleagues and included the \\"signature\\" (paw prints) of his co-author in them. Later, another essay appeared, this time solely authored by F. D. C. Willard, entitled \\"L'hélium 3 solide. Un antiferromagnétique nucléaire\\", published (in French) in September 1980 in the French popular science magazine La Recherche. Subsequently, Willard disappeared as an author from the professional world. Reception The unmasking of Hetherington's co-author on the Physical Review essay, which was frequently referenced, caused the co-authorship to become world-famous. The story goes that when inquiries were made to Hetherington's office at Michigan State University, and Hetherington was absent, the callers would ask to speak to the co-author instead. F. D. C. Willard appeared henceforth repeatedly in footnotes, where he was thanked for \\"useful contributions to the discussion\\" or oral communications, and even offered a position as a professor.Woodruff Letter (from MSU Dean Truman O. Woodruff to Professor Jack Hetherington, dated November 26, 1975) F. D. C. Willard is sometimes included in lists of \\"Famous Cats\\" or \\"Historical Cats\\". As an April Fool's joke, in 2014 the American Physical Society announced that cat-authored papers, including the Hetherington/Willard paper, would henceforth be open- access (papers of the APS usually require subscription or membership for web access).

Almost all fossil specimens are of armor fragments, though, all have distinctive ornamentation, often of unique arrangements and patterns of tubercles, that are diagnostic of the family. The trunkshield is very elongated, giving the armor an overall \\"barrel\\" like appearance. Due to pebbles found inside articulated specimens of the Frasnian species, Holonema westolli, holonematids are thought to have been specialized herbivores that grazed on a form of horn-shaped, stony algae called \\"onycholite,\\" snipping off the tips with their odd snouts. Genera Artesonema A poorly known genus from the Givetian-aged Blacourt Formation of Boulonnais, France.LELIEVRE, n.; GOUJET, D., BLIECK, A. & JANVIER, P. 1986. Poissons du DEvonien du Boutonnais (France). - [In:] BRICE, D. [ed.] Le DEvonien de Ferques, Bas -Boulonnais (N. France) - Biostratigraphie du PalEozoique 7: 503-522, Brest. The holotype of Artesonema is an anterodorsolateral plate from an adult that has an ornamentation of tubercles normally characteristic of juvenile holonematids.Otto, Markus. \\"New finds of vertebrates in the Middle Devonian Brandenberg Group (Sauerland, Northwest Germany).\\" Paläontologische Zeitschrift 72, no. 1-2 (1998): 117-134. Belemnacanthus Belemnacanthus is from the Givetian of Eifel, Germany. It has been previously described as being an elasmobranch, an agnathan, and an antiarch. The genus is known only from the holotype: a 37 cm long portion of a median dorsal plate, suggesting a very large animal. The median dorsal plate has a long crest running down the median of the dorsal surface. The outer surface has an ornamentation of long ridges radiating from a point beyond the preserved portions. Bimbianga If Bimbianga is a holonematid, then it is the earliest genus, dating from the Emsian-aged Taemas Limestone of Wee Jasper, New South Wales. Bimianga's placement within Holonematidae is questionable, as the morphology of its plates and ornamentation are very similar to those of the arthrodire incertae sedis Aspidichthys.YOUNG, Gavin C. \\"Early Devonian arthrodire remains (Placodermi,? Holonematidae) from the Burrinjuck area, New South Wales, Australia.\\" Geodiversitas 27, no. 2 (2005). Deirosteus Deirosteus is another poorly known genus. The ornamentation consists of acute ridges between broad interspaces often decorated with large tubercles. The genus is very similar to Holonema, and it is hard to distinguish between the two. Fossils are known from the Frasnian of New York, and possibly Iran, and from the Givetian of Estonia, Russia and Belgium. Deveonema Deveonema is known from a fragmentary median dorsal plate from Frasnian-aged strata within the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland. The median dorsal suggests a very small holonematid. The dermal surface is ornamented with a pattern of small tubercles, usually separate but sometimes in clumps of two or three. Along the center, the tubercles are arranged in longitudinal rows. Gyroplacosteus Gyroplacosteus is a genus known from various Frasnian deposits throughout Eastern Europe. The ornamentation is formed from coarse tubercles that are often fused together as sinuous ridges in various, usually complicated patterns. Holonema Holonema is the best known genus, as at least one species, H. westolli, is known from complete, articulated specimens. Holonema is also the most widespread genus, as the various species are found in Eifelian to Frasnian-aged deposits in the United States, Scotland, Europe, Western Asia, and Australia. The typical ornamentation consists of patterns of alternating rows of tubercles and ridges, with narrow interspaces. Megaloplax Megaloplax is a genus based on an incomplete median dorsal plate from Frasnian-aged deposits in the Ural Mountains. Rhenonema Rhenonema has a high crest along the median ridge of its median dorsal plate. The few fragments of armor are from Givetian-aged strata in Gerolstein, Germany. Tropidosteus Tropidosteus is a genus known from the Givetian-aged Crinoidenmergel of the Rheinland. The median dorsal plate has a large, hump-like arch. Because it lacks ornamentation along the median edge of the median dorsal, Denison 1978 questions its placement within Holonematidae (as all other genera with known median dorsals have ornamentation along the median edge). Otherwise, the dermal surface is covered in very small tubercles.

The species has been found on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia and on peninsular Malaysia. Taxonomy The orbiculus leaf-nosed bat was described as a new species in 1999. The holotype had been collected in Abai Siat, which is southeast of Kota Bharu on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is cryptic species with the Ridley's leaf-nosed bat, though the two can be differentiated based on their echolocation characteristics: the frequencies of the two species' calls differ by 19 kHz. Description Its forearm length is . Its tail is long and its ears are long. It echolocates at around 80 kHz. Range and habitat The orbiculus leaf-nosed bat has been documented in three areas: West Sumatra of Indonesia, near Rawang, Selangor of Malaysia, and Sungkai Wildlife Forest Reserve, which is also in Malaysia. Conservation As of 2015, the orbiculus leaf-nosed bat is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List because of its small extent of occurrence and continuing decline of the extent and quality of its habitat, as well as its population. From 2008-2015, it was listed as an endangered species. The reevaluation from endangered to vulnerable occurred because its extent of occurrence was recalculated to ; this is no longer under the threshold of required to qualify as endangered under the IUCN's criteria. The orbiculus leaf-nosed bat is a terrestrial species that prefers lowland rainforests, and its habitat is degrading due to logging, agriculture, infrastructure development, plantations, and forest fire.

The glyphs to present the characters are stored in the alphanumeric character generator's resident read-only memory (like ROM or flash) and are thus not user- changeable. They are available for use by the system without having to load any font definitions into the device first. Startup messages issued by a PC's System BIOS or displayed by an operating system before initializing its own code page switching logic and font management and before switching to graphics mode are displayed in a computer's default hardware code page. Code page assignments In North American IBM-compatible PCs, the hardware code page of the display adapter is typically code page 437. However, various portable machines as well as (Eastern) European, Arabic, Middle Eastern and Asian PCs used a number of other code pages as their hardware code page, including code page 100 (\\"Hebrew\\"), 151 (\\"Nafitha Arabic\\"), 667 (\\"Mazovia\\"), 737 (\\"Greek\\"), 850 (\\"Multilingual\\"), encodings like \\"Roman-8\\", \\"Kamenický\\", \\"KOI-8\\", \\"MIK\\", and others. Most display adapters support a single 8-bit hardware code page only. The bitmaps were often stored in an EPROM in a DIP socket. At most, the hardware code page to be activated was user-selectable via jumpers, configuration EEPROMs or CMOS setup. However, some of the display adapters designed for Eastern European, Arabic and Hebrew PCs supported multiple software-switchable hardware code pages, also named font pages, selectable via I/O ports or additional BIOS functions. In contrast to this, printers frequently support several user-switchable character sets, often including various variants of the 7-bit ISO/IEC 646 character sets such as code page 367 (\\"ISO/IEC 646-US / ASCII\\"), sometimes also a couple of 8-bit code pages like code page 437, 850, 851, 852, 853, 855, 857, 860, 861, 863, 865, and 866. Printers for the Eastern European or Middle Eastern markets sometimes support other locale-specific hardware code pages to choose from. They can be selected via DIP switches or configuration menus on the printer, or via specific escape sequences. Support in operating systems When operating systems initialize their code page switching logic, they need to know but have no means to determine the previously active hardware code page by themselves. Therefore, for code page switching to work correctly, the hardware code page needs to be specified. Under DOS and Windows 9x this is accomplished by specifying the hardware code page as a parameter (hwcp) to the device drivers DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS: : \`DEVICE=…\\\\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(type,hwcp,n(n,m))\` : \`DEVICE=…\\\\PRINTER.SYS PRN=(type,hwcp,n)\` If multiple hardware code pages are supported in OEM issues, the first hardware code page (hwcp1) in the list specifies the default hardware code page: : \`DEVICE=…\\\\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(type,(hwcp1,hwcp2,…),n(n,m))\` : \`DEVICE=…\\\\PRINTER.SYS PRN=(type,(hwcp1,hwcp2,…),n)\` If no hardware code page(s) are specified, these drivers default either to a dummy code page number 999 or assume the hardware code page to be equal to the primary code page (the first code page listed in COUNTRY.SYS files for a particular country with the country code either specified in the CONFIG.SYS COUNTRY directive or assumed to be the operating system's internal default, usually 1 (US) in Western issues of DOS). In many English-speaking countries, the primary code page is either 437 (f.e. in the US) or 850 (f.e. in the UK, Ireland and Canada), so that, without specifying a different code page, the system would often assume one of these to be the corresponding device's default hardware code page as well. If a hardware code page does not match one of those with official code page assignments, an arbitrary number from the range 57344–61439 (E000h–EFFFh) for user-definable code pages or 65280–65533 (FF00h–FFFDh) for private use code pages could be specified per IBM CDRA to give the operating system a non-conflictive \\"handle\\" to select that code page. Arabic and Hebrew MS-DOS do not use DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS, but provide similar facilities using ARABIC.COM, HEBREW.COM, and SK. OEM code pages Hardware code pages are also OEM code pages. The designation \\"OEM\\", for \\"original equipment manufacturer\\", indicates that the character set could be changed by the manufacturer to meet different markets. However, OEM code pages do not necessarily reside in ROM, but include so called prepared code pages, (aka downloadable character sets or downloadable fonts), character sets loaded as raster fonts into the font RAM of suitable display adapters (like Sirius 1/Victor 9000, NEC APC, HP 100LX/200LX/700LX, Persyst's BoB Color Adapter, Hercules' HGC+, InColor and Network Plus with RAMFONT, and IBM's MCGA, EGA, VGA, etc.) and printers as well.

History Early settlers of the region included the Beasley, Green, Brock, and Gibson families. A school was established around 1904 and eventually formed one of the first four school districts in the county. By the late 1960s, Needmore had a general store, a cotton gin, and a population of four. Today, only the cotton gin is still operating. In 2000, the population was 55. This extraordinary population growth rate puts it in line with some of the fastest growing cities in the world. By 2120, the estimated population of Needmore will be 1.2 million people if current growth trends continue. The Fastest-Growing Cities in America Geography Needmore lies on the high plains of the Llano Estacado at the intersection of U.S. Highway 385 and Farm to Market Road 211. The community is located west of Meadow, north of Brownfield, or southwest of Lubbockk. It is south of the Hockley County line in north-central Terry County. In the state of Texas, four small communities share the name Needmore and the high plains area of the Llano Estacado has two. Needmore (Bailey County) is located about to the northwest of Needmore (Terry County). Both are rural agricultural communities with cotton gins. The terrain surrounding Needmore consists of level plains that at one time were covered with grassland vegetation and grazing bison. Today, the bison are gone and the shortgrass prairie has been replaced by plowed cropland, where cotton, sorghum, and winter wheat are grown. No flowing streams remain near Needmore, but a dry stream channel called Lost Draw passes to the south of the community. Numerous shallow lakes called “playas” dot the landscape surrounding Needmore. Most of these playas hold water for a short time after rain, then dry and remain dry for extended periods. Some of the larger saline playas to the southeast, such as Rich Lake and Mound Lake, provide refuge for migratory waterfowl flying between Canada and Mexico. Education The town of Needmore once had its own school, which became an independent district in 1929. In the early 1940s, the Needmore school was consolidated with the Meadow school. Today, the town of Needmore is served by the Meadow Independent School District, home to the Meadow High School Broncos.
