The plot and characters are exactly the same as in the series, with the exception that the novel form allowed Gaiman to expand and elaborate on certain elements of the story and restore changes made in the televised version from his original plans.Tweet @neilhimself, Twitter. Most notable is the appearance of the Floating Market at Harrods (in the novel) rather than under Battersea power station (the TV series). This is because the management of Harrods changed their minds about proposed filming. The novel was originally released by BBC Books in 1996, three episodes into the television series run. It was accompanied by a spoken word CD and cassette release, also by the BBC. The novel enjoyed great success, whereas its television roots did not receive as much international exposure as the novel. In addition to being translated into various languages, it was also re-published as an \\"Author's Preferred Text\\" version, (a combination of the international and original English version, with additional scenes re-inserted by Gaiman) alongside American Gods in 2006. The original BBC Books version had a cover by longtime Gaiman collaborator Dave McKean, taken from the bird's head rings, flaming fist and London Underground styled graphics created by McKean for the series, as well as a brief section by Gaiman on the making of the series. Plot Neverwhere is the story of Richard Mayhew and his trials and tribulations in London. At the start of the story, he is a young businessman, recently moved from Scotland and with a normal life ahead. This breaks, however, when he stops to help a mysterious young girl who appears before him, bleeding and weakened, as he walks with his fianc√©e to dinner to meet her influential boss. The morning after Richard rescues the girl, named Door, from the streets, she is greatly recovered and sends him to find the Marquis de Carabas, a man who will be able to help Door escape two infamous (and seemingly inhuman) assassins, the Messrs Croup and Vandemar. Richard brings the Marquis back to his apartment to meet Door, only to see both of them vanish immediately. Soon after, Richard begins to realise the consequences of his actions. He appears to have become invisible; he loses his job, where no one seems to recognise him, and his apartment is rented out to other people. His fianc√©e no longer recognizes him either. Determined to set things right, Richard tries to enter the world of London Below in search of Door. He finds a tramp from Below, who is the only person able to see him, and recites the name of the Floating Market as the only place known to him in underworld. The tramp brings Richard to the realm of the Rat-Speakers, who worship and perform tasks for rats. They attempt to assault and rob Richard, but follow orders from the master rat and let him free. He then travels across the mysterious Night's Bridge, whose darkness kills Richard's Rat-Speaker guide, Anaesthesia. Eventually he arrives to the Floating Market, where he meets again with Door, who is holding an audition for bodyguards. Going to the Market, a giant bazaar where people barter for all manner of junk and magical items, Richard realises that London Below is not such a bad place. The legendary bodyguard and fighter Hunter joins Richard, Door and the Marquis and the party set out for the Earl's Court. Door and the Marquis have previously travelled to Door's home and discovered a diary entry made by Door's father, which advises her to seek aid from the angel Islington. When the four reach the Earl's Court, on a mysterious underground train which follows its own bizarre schedule, the Marquis is forced to leave. This is due to an old grudge between himself and the Earl. The rest discover that they need to travel through the relic Angelus to reach Islington, and that the Angelus resides in the British Museum. Door and Richard travel to the Museum, while Hunter, due to a curse which prevents her from entering London Above, remains in the abandoned British Museum underground station. After some searching they find the Angelus, which Door \\"opens\\" using her family's Talent, and travel through it to the underground home of the angel. Islington explains that his position as protector of London Below is a punishment for the submersion of Atlantis, which was also under his care, and tells Door that he will help her learn the identity of those who killed her family, for a price. She and her company must retrieve a unique key from the Black Friars and bring it to the angel. The two return to the Museum and go below to reunite with Hunter. In the meantime, the Marquis seeks out Croup and Vandemar, exchanging a priceless Tang dynasty figurine for information regarding who ordered the murder of Door's family. The true price for this information, however, is his life; Croup and Vandemar capture, torture, and kill him, breaking the one-hour \\"head start\\" agreement that was part of their deal with the Marquis. Door, Richard, and Hunter proceed onward to the dwelling of the Black Friars. There, they are faced with a series of three ordeals; Hunter wins a test of strength, Door wins a test of intellect, and Richard, alone in history, wins a test of character. He is convinced his adventures Below had all been a hallucination, but a trinket from his now-dead friend Anaesthesia re-orients him. As a result, the three succeed in gaining the key. Richard's ordeal greatly changes him, causing him to lose most of his self-doubts; he is now confident enough to interact with other beings of London Below. The three then travel to the Floating Market, where they are unable to find the Marquis, but where Hammersmith, a blacksmith friend of Door's, is able to secretly forge a copy of the key won by Richard. Richard enlists the mysterious Lamia, one of the vampire-like Velvets, as a guide to lead them to the angel's residence. They travel on London Below's Down Street, toward Islington. Door, Richard, Lamia, and Hunter make their way down the long path of Down Street. Meanwhile, the Marquis's body is found on a Market and revived by Old Bailey, who uses the box containing the Marquis's life. Weakened, the Marquis sets out himself, following Door and company. On Down Street, it is discovered that Lamia was a dangerous choice for a guide, because the price she demands of Richard for her services is higher than he can pay and yet live, but the Marquis appears in time to save him. Hunter reveals she long ago was a traitor to Door's cause. She gives Door to Croup and Vandemar, in exchange for the magical spear she needs to hunt and slay the great Beast of London. Croup and Vandemar, with Door captive, travel downward, while Richard, the Marquis, and Hunter travel at a slower pace, all toward the great labyrinth through which they need to pass to reach Islington. In this labyrinth the Beast of London dwells. Hunter and Richard battle it, with Richard being the only survivor. Richard and the Marquis rush ahead, to the final confrontation between the parties, in which Islington's true nature is revealed. Islington is revealed to have ordered Croup and Vandemar to execute Door's family as revenge for Door's father's refusal to assist him. He also reveals he had also manipulated her father's diary in order to lure her to him. Islington wishes to use Door and the key to force open the door to Heaven, where he seeks dominion over all the other angels as revenge for his banishment. After Richard is tortured by Croup and Vandemar, Door agrees to open the door, but she uses the copy of the key Richard won. The key does not open the door to Heaven, but instead to somewhere else, as far away as she could imagine, presumably to Hell. Islington, Croup and Vandemar are all sucked through the gateway before Door closes it. Door then uses the Black Friars' real key to allow Richard to travel back to London Above, where he finds himself restored to his normal life as it was before he first met Door. After returning home, Richard is happy for a time, but he realises that his experiences have changed him, and that his old life and friends mean little to him now. He realises that he is not satisfied with the regular world, and wants to return to London Below but does not know how to do it. He draws the shape of a door with his knife (a dying gift from Hunter), but nothing happens so he despairs of returning and is feeling that he has ruined his life, but in the end the Marquis appears to provide a way back. Adaptations and sequels Gaiman hinted at a novella-length sequel in the commentary section of his short story collection Fragile Things, published in 2009. The story, titled \\"How The Marquis Got His Coat Back\\", was at that time said to be \\"half- written\\". The story was published in the 2014 anthology Rogues, edited by George R. R. Martin. Gaiman's website FAQ states that a novel-length sequel to the book is a possibility; it will most likely be titled The Seven Sisters. Aside from an undated statement that \\"I don't think it's the next book I'll write,\\" there is no indication of when the novel may be completed. In February 2017, whilst promoting his newest book, Norse Mythology, in London, Gaiman confirmed to applause from the audience that he was three chapters into writing The Seven Sisters. A nine-issue comic book limited series began in June 2005, written by Mike Carey (of the Vertigo Comics series Lucifer), with art by Glenn Fabry. An all-star radio adaptation was broadcast 16‚Äì22 March 2013, commissioned by BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 4 Extra. Comments by critics were extremely favourable. In 2017, HarperAudio, an imprint of HarperCollins, released an audiobook of the novel, narrated by Gaiman.

In that case, all rupture fields of P(X) over K are isomorphic, non canonically, to K_P=K[X]/(P(X)): if L=K[a] where a is a root of P(X), then the ring homomorphism f defined by f(k)=k for all k\\\\in K and f(X\\\\mod P)=a is an isomorphism.

For many Caribbean nations, the increasing ties with China have been used as a way to decrease long time over-dependence on the United States. The Overseas Chinese population, in this case Chinese Caribbeans, help make the connections with trade and political links. As of , nine states in the Caribbean recognized the PRC and four recognized the ROC. Additionally, China's policy in the region has been the use of \\"dollar diplomacy\\" or the attempts to switch several nations from recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation, towards the recognition of the \\"One China\\" policy, in exchange for Chinese investment. Outside of China's stated position on where it stands about Taiwan, trade between China and the Caribbean region has been steadily increasing. China has also expanded several levels of cooperation with the Caribbean region. China and the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago were said to have formed an agreement where asphalt from Trinidad and Tobago would be exported to China during its construction boom in preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In exchange, China has led several construction projects in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean region via Chinese owned construction companies. Trinidad and Tobago has also mooted the idea of starting direct shipments of oil and liquid natural gas direct from Trinidad and Tobago to China, to fuel the later's growing need for resources to fuel their economy. As the Caribbean political heads of government have had several messy run-ins with the Bush administration in the United States with respect to recent demands, China has been more sympathetic to the Caribbean position globally and has stepped up military training exercises in the Caribbean for example in direct response to several sanctions placed on governments in the Caribbean region for not following the wishes of the Bush administration. Several capital-works or infrastructural projects across the Caribbean region have also been financed by the Chinese government.

It was developed by A. D. Borisov, V. N. Levchenko and A. Tyshlykov at TsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building) in the early 1990s and was manufactured in 1994. Heavily based on the AS Val, but lacks an integral suppressor, has a newly designed folding stock and charging handle for ease of concealed carry. The abbreviation \\"SR\\" stands for spetsialnaya razrabotka ‚Äî special development. Because the SR-3 Vikhr is a rather expensive weapon for its small size and weight, it was not mass produced for the Russian military. Although, it was primarily used by the Russian Special Operations Forces and certain government officials' security details. History After the adoption of the SR-3 Vikhr, the FSB established new operational requirements with a goal to combine the qualities of the SR-3, AS Val and VSS Vintorez, resulting in a new variant designated as the SR-3M (–°–†-3–ú). Design alt= The SR-3 is a compact assault rifle chambered in 9√ó39mm subsonic cartridge. It is primarily used with the SP-6 armour piercing ammunition with a hardened steel penetrator, that can penetrate a 6mm steel plate at a range of 200 metres. Along side the SP-6, a lower cost SP-5 ball ammunition with a heavy bullet and PAB-9 ammunition is also used. The SR-3 is based on the AS Val, but lacks the integral suppressor. As a result, it is much more compact than the AS Val. The SR-3 is a select-fire, gas-operated action with a long stroke piston. It uses the same rotating bolt group from the AS Val, and fires from a closed bolt. It has a more compact, top-folding buttstock and a simplified flip-up rear sight which can be set for 100 metres or 200 metres distance compared to the AS Val. The redesigned charging handle, made in the form of dual sliders above the forearm, and must be grasped by thumb and index finger and then retracted to load the weapon. The trigger unit is generally the same as in the AS Val, but the AK-type safety is replaced by ambidextrous lever above the pistol grip. The fire mode selector is of cross- bolt, push button type and located behind the trigger, inside the trigger guard. Variants alt= alt=  SR-3M  The SR-3M is a modernised variant of the SR-3 Vikhr. It receives an improved polymer furniture, a more convenient charging handle, an AS-style controls (safety lever, semi- automatic/full automatic selector switch is inside the trigger guard), an AS- style side-folding stock, a redesigned handguard with a folding foregrip and where the rear sight is now located, a specially developed quick-detachable suppressor, a Warsaw Pact rail mount, and a new magazine with a 30-round capacity which provides a more reliable feeding during automatic fire whilst still compatible with the 10- and 20-round magazines from the SR-3, AS Val and the VSS Vintorez. It is also worth to mention that the 30-round magazine is also compatible with the AS Val and VSS Vintorez.  SR-3MP  The SR-3MP is a further modernisation of the SR-3M. It features a new Dovetail rail mount for mounting various optical sights. The handguard receives two Picatinny rails on each side for mounting laser sights, tactical flashlights and other tactical accessories. An additional rail is added below the pistol grip for the folding stock to be mounted for operators who wears a full-face shield mask, bullet-proof helmet or night vision gear to still be able to aim by the shoulder without the stock getting in the way.

He is best known for his \\"My Queer Life\\" series of humorous essay collections and for his award-winning novels Last Summer, Looking for It, Full Circle, Changing Tides and What We Remember. Career highlights Michael Thomas Ford is the author of more than fifty books for both young readers and adults. He is best known for his best-selling novels Last Summer, Looking for It, and Full Circle and for his five essay collections in the \\"Trials of My Queer Life\\" series. His work has been nominated for eleven Lambda Literary Awards, twice winning for Best Humor Book and twice for Best Romance Novel. He was also nominated for a Horror Writers Association Bram Stoker Award (for his novel The Dollhouse That Time Forgot) and a Gay lactic Spectrum Award (for his short story \\"Night of the Were puss\\"). Ford began his writing career in 1992 with the publication of 100 Questions & Answers about AIDS: What You Need to Know Now (Macmillan), one of the first books about the AIDS crisis for young adults. Named an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults, the book became the most widely used resource in HIV education programs for young people and was translated into more than a dozen languages. The follow-up to that book, The Voices of AIDS (William Morrow, 1995), was a collection of interviews with people whose lives have been affected by the AIDS crisis. This book too was named an ALA Best Book, as well as a National Science Teachers Association- Children's Book Council Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children and a Booklist magazine Editors' Choice. Ford's next book, 1996's The World Out There: Becoming Part of the Lesbian and Gay Community (The New Press), was a handbook for people coming out and wanting to know what it means to be part of the queer world. It earned him his first Lambda Literary Award nomination in the YA category, as well as a Firecracker Alternative Book Award nomination. 1998 saw the release of two books, the first being OutSpoken (William Morrow), a collection of interviews with gay and lesbian people that was again aimed at young adults. The book was widely praised for its candid discussions of queerlife, and it was named both a National Council of Social Studies- Children's Book Council Notable Children's Book in the field of Social Studies and a Booklist magazine \\"Top of the List\\" selection, and received a Lambda Literary Award nomination, Ford's second in the YA division. Ford's second book to come out that year was Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me (Alyson Books), the first of what has come to be known as the \\"Trials of My Queer Life\\" series. The book was based on the columns Ford had been publishing for several years in his syndicated newspaper column, \\"My Queer Life.\\" The book received a Lambda Literary Award for Best Humor book, winning out over titles by lesbian comic Kate Clinton, columnist Dan Savage, and cartoonist Alison Bechdel. Ford followed the success of Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me with That's Mr. Faggot to You (Alyson Books, 1999). Slightly more acerbic than its predecessor, Mr. Faggot brought Ford a whole new audience hungry for a voice they could relate to. Again the book soared to the top of the bestseller charts, and once again Ford walked away with a Lambda Literary Award, edging out previous winner comedian Bob Smith. That same year he began recording his weekly radio show for the GayBC Radio Network. The third in the \\"Trials of My Queer Life\\" series, It's Not Mean If It's True (Alyson Books), arrived in stores in 2000. Following in the footsteps of the first two, the book was an instant bestseller, and Ford was once again nominated for a Lambda Literary Award for best humor book. Although he lost to comic superstar David Sedaris, the attention earned Mike the notice of Michael J. Rosen, director of the James Thurber House and editor of the prestigious \\"Mirth of a Nation\\" series of Best American Humor Writing. As a result, two of Mike's essays were included in the second Mirth collection (Simon & Schuster, 2002) and featured on a CD read by actor Tony Roberts. Also coming out in 2000 were two other projects. The first was Ford's first audio recording. My Queer Life (Fluid Words), featured Ford reading some of the most popular pieces from his three essay collections. The recording also contained two songs from \\"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me,\\" a musical project for which Ford wrote the lyrics and performed the narration. A full-length recording of the musical, performed by the Lehigh Valley Gay Men's Chorus, is also available on CD. My Queer Life received rave notices in audio media journals, and was named one of the two best humor audio books of the year (the other being David Sedaris's Me Talk Pretty One Day). In December 2000 Ford released Paths of Faith: Conversations about Religion and Spirituality (Simon & Schuster). Written for young adults, the book was a collection of interviews with leaders from a wide range of spiritual traditions and included the last interview given by former Archbishop of New York John Cardinal O'Connor. The book returned Ford to the genre in which he first became well-known, and like his previous books for young adults this one was unanimously praised for its insightful take on an often delicate topic, being named a Booklist magazine Top 10 Religion Book of the Year, a Booklist Editors' Choice \\"Top of the List\\" selection for YA Nonfiction, and a New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age. In October 2001 Ford's fourth essay collection, The Little Book of Neuroses, hit bookstores and like the previous three collections became an instant favorite with readers, immediately shooting to #1 on numerous regional bestseller lists. Also like the others, in February 2002 it was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award, giving Ford an unprecedented four consecutive nominations in the category of Best Humor Book. The summer of 2002 found Ford embarking on yet another adventure as This Queern Life, a stage production based on his work and penned by him, premiered at the Loring Playhouse in Minneapolis. An insightful and riotous collection of scenes drawn from his essay collections, the play wowed audiences and is currently being considered for production by numerous regional theaters. Also in that year, his short story \\"Night of the Werepuss\\" was published in the Lambda Literary Award-winning collection Queer Fear II and was nominated for a Gaylactic Spectrum Award for best short fiction. In 2003 Ford entered a new phase of his career with the release of his first novel for adults. Published by Kensington Books, Last Summer centered around the character of Joshua Felling, who escapes to Provincetown for a few days of reflection after discovering that his lover is having an affair and then finds himself caught up in the lives of the people he meets there. The book was an immediate hit, earning rave reviews and comparisons to Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City. Publishers Weekly described the book as a \\"brimful first novel about life, love and self-discovery\\" and praised the \\"crisp prose and snappy, contemporary dialogue,\\" while Entertainment Weekly lauded Ford's prose, calling it a \\"winner\\" and \\"addictive.\\" This new book was a huge favorite with fans, and won the Lambda Literary Award for Best Romance Novel. Also appearing in 2003 was Sting, an unusual and haunting vampire novella included in the book Masters of Midnight, and My Big, Fat, Queer Life, a best-of collection compiling the most popular essays from his \\"Trials of My Queer Life\\" series. Both books received Lambda Literary Award nominations. In early 2004 Ford surprised fans with the arrival of Ultimate Gay Sex, a beautifully photo-illustrated guide to sex and relationships for which he wrote the text. Drawing on his years of experience writing the \\"Sexpert\\" and \\"Sex Adviser\\" columns for gay men's magazines FreshMen and Men, he created an indispensable manual covering topics ranging from coming out to aging, sexual health to sexual positions. Ford's second novel for Kensington Books, Looking for It, was published in the summer of 2004. Centered around the lives of a group of gay men living in a small upstate New York town, the novel was heralded by Booklist as an \\"engaging page-turner of lives within lives, an insightful and entertaining read about what we seek, and what answers we find within and without.\\" Like its predecessor, Looking for It reached the top of gay bestseller charts and quickly became the hottest gay book of the summer. Ford's second vampire- themed novella was featured in the 2004 Kensington Books collection Midnight Thirsts. Set against the background of a weary American Midwest during World War II, Carnival is the story of midway ride mechanic Joe Flanagan, who finds his quiet life disrupted by the arrival of the mysterious Mr. Star and his traveling freak show. 2005 brought the publication of The Path of the Green Man: Gay Men, Wicca, and Living a Magical Life (Citadel Press). Drawing on Ford's interest in religion and spirituality, the book set forth a blueprint for gay men interested in exploring pagan spirituality from a uniquely gay viewpoint. Praised as an eloquent meditation on pagan thought and beliefs, the book brought Ford his tenth Lambda Literary Award nomination. In it, he revealed that between 2001 and 2002, he wrote the Wiccan-themed, YA Circle of Three series under the pseudonym Isobel Bird. Also in 2005 came Tangled Sheets, a collection of erotica Ford had written under various names over the years. Long-asked-for by fans of Mike's nom-de-porn, the book was welcomed as a literary exploration of sensuality, desire, and self-discovery. In 2006, Ford released the much-anticipated novel Full Circle. Called by one reviewer \\"the Great Gay American Novel\\", the book chronicled the lives of two men‚Äîbest friends born a day apart in 1950‚Äîthrough six decades. In effect a history of gay life, the book was also a profound statement about the friendships that exist between gay men. Upon its release, the book went to the top of numerous regional bestseller lists. Changing Tides, Ford's fourth novel for adult readers, was released in August 2007. Exploring the themes of family and self- discovery, the novel centers around a marine biologist in Monterey whose quiet life is turned upside down by the arrival of his estranged teenage daughter and by his attraction to a graduate student in English who comes to California to research what might be an unpublished John Steinbeck novel about a Cannery Row worker coming to terms with his love for another man in 1940s America. The novel won Ford his second Lambda Literary Award in the Gay Men's Romance category. In October 2008, Ford returned to his young adult roots with the publication of Suicide Notes (HarperCollins), the blackly comic story of a young man forced to come to terms with his emerging sexuality after a failed attempt at ending his life puts him in a psychiatric hospital. In 2009 Ford released his fifth novel with Kensington, What We Remember, a portrait of a family torn apart when the father, believed to have committed suicide, is found to have been murdered. As the mystery around his death is unraveled, so too is the tragic history of a family that isn't what it seems. What We Remember won the 2009 Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Mystery. In December 2009 Ballantine released Ford's Jane Bites Back, the first of a three-book series about Jane Austen, who still exists as a vampire bookshop owner living in the New York suburbs, who has to deal with two suitors and a dark figure from her past. In May 2010 Ford published The Road Home, his sixth novel for Kensington Books. The Road Home is the story of a photographer who, following a car accident, reluctantly moves in with his father. As he recuperates, he becomes intrigued by the story of a local man who fought in the Civil War, and his interest leads to uncovering some surprising truths. Current Times In September 2010 HarperCollins will release Ford's next YA novel. Titled Z it tells the story of Josh who finds that his involvement with a virtual zombie killing game is much more than it seems. References Additional Sources  Day, Frances Ann (2000).

Sir Louis, was the founder of Ojukwu Transport, Ojukwu Stores and Ojukwu Textiles. At his peak, he was the first and founding president of The Nigerian Stock Exchange as well as president of The African Continental Bank. He was also either chairman or on the board of directors of some of Nigeria's most profitable companies such as Shell Oil Nigeria Limited, Guinness Nig. Ltd, Nigerian National Shipping Lines, Nigerian Cement Factory, Nigerian Coal Corporation, Costain West Africa Ltd, John Holt, Nigerian Marketing Board amongst others. He won a parliamentary seat during the nation's first republic. He attended a primary school in Asaba and the Hope Waddell Institute. His son Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu was a Nigerian military governor and the president of the secessionist state of Biafra. Life and career In 1936 he met Bishop John Cross Anyogu - then a parish priest at Nnewi. Louis was a Roman Catholic. Ojukwu started his professional career at the Agricultural department before leaving to join John Holt as a tyre sales clerk. He also incorporated a textile company in Onitsha to supplement his income during this period, already exhibiting a little bit of his entrepreneurial spirit. While at John Holt, he noticed the severe strain a lack of adequate transportation had on Eastern textile traders. He later left John Holt to create a transport company to improve the trading environment for Nigerian traders. As a transporter he was a tireless worker and meticulous to detail; he was usually the first to inspect his transport vehicles for oil and leakages. Apart from his work ethic, his success was also oiled by the economic boom after World War II, working with the West African Railway Company and the newly inaugurated produce boards, he provided his fleet for commodity transportation and for other traders use. As a transporter he had his own transport company (Ojukwu Transport Limited) which was the first major transport company to move the easterners to Lagos from the Asaba end of the Niger river after they might have crossed over from Onitsha on a boat. During the 1950s, he diversified his interest, bought some industries, invested heavily in the real estate sector and became a director in numerous major corporations including the state-owned Nigerian National Shipping Line. He was a member of the board of Nigerian Coal Corporation, Shell Oil, D'Archy, and African Continental Bank. During the period of pre-independence and in the First Republic, Ojukwu was an active member and donor to the political party, NCNC. He was a one-time member of the House of Representative. In 1958, he was chairman of the Eastern Region Development Corporation and the Eastern Regional Marketing Board. On May 1, 1953, he was appointed head of an NCNC peace committee and given power to choose most of the committee's members. The committee was charged with the responsibility of restoring peace in the regional House of Assembly. His views on policy were a little bit capitalistic and right of Zik's socialist undertones. He was a co-author of a report on the Economic Mission to Europe and North America with Azikiwe, the report recommended the investment of extra funds from the produce marketing board in a regional bank and public corporations to stimulate economic development. Ojukwu died in 1966, just a year before the Nigerian civil war. His son Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu was the leader of the secessionist state of Biafra. The Ojukwus have produced a family history that bucks the trend in at least one respect: birthing a famous son who became more widely known than his famous father. Most people who know anything of the Ojukwu will only have heard of Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, the leader of the old secessionist state of Biafra, or his wife, Bianca. Not many know a certain Louis, father of the better known Emeka, and (here's where he has a bragging right) Nigeria's first billionaire. Louis Philip Odumegwu-Ojukwu was a man of significant accomplishments. It's perfectly understandable why his achievements currently lie in the shadows of his military commander son's engagements. However, a case can be made for a wider recognition of all the firsts he notched up. There's a good deal of inspiration to be derived from Louis's story. His many wins were more the product of a strong work ethic than of anything else. Starting off as a low-level employee at the agricultural department and then at John Holt, he beat a path through the uncertain business terrain of pre- independence Nigeria and wound up at the zenith of the country's entrepreneurial ladder. Perhaps there was something about his background which spurred him on. Nnewi, the town he hailed from, has produced an unusually long list of naira billionaire business people (Innoson's Innocent Chukwuma and Ibeto Group's Cletus Ibeto are just two examples). Whether he had a gene for spotting opportunities or not, he certainly sensed a promise beaconing when he left John Holt to found his own company. Louis's first big venture was his transport company, which he named after himself. His trucks helped to facilitate cross-country trade by moving products between different regions. Because his transport business was plugging a hole that was still considerably open at the time, he made a significant fortune from it. Throughout the era of the World War and after, the Ojukwu trucks carried goods and raked in income for their owner. At a point, the British had their supplies for the war moved by Louis's trucks- a service for which Louis was later rewarded; years later, he was conferred with an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II. The relatively upbeat economic environment of the post World War years presented an opportunity to diversify into other business concerns, and Louis seized upon it. Besides shipping stockfish to Nigeria, he also got involved in real estate and sold textiles and cement. As his wealth grew, his influence and clout began to extend beyond the industry. He was active in pre-independence politics and was a donor of the National Council of Nigeria and Cameroons (NCNC), a political party which had Nnamdi Azikiwe as one of its members. At a point, he was elected to the House of Representatives. Back in his familiar terrain of commerce, Louis became even more influential. He sat on the boards of many of the country's biggest companies and was also a founder and first president of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. By the time of his death in 1966, Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu's wealth was worth $4 billion by the current value. Beyond his wealth and bourgeoise culinary tastes, he had lived his entrepreneurial life in an exemplary way, at least in one sense: his meticulousness with his business dealings. The very mindset that gave rise to his successes was the one which caused him to inspect his trucks with such keenness and punctuality. It was the oil that lubricated his business's history-spinning machine.

The game was famous for referee Bob Rakel disallowing a game-tying basket because he claimed the buzzer sounded, even though there was one second left on the clock, and also for being the first incident where an official protest was upheld by the NBA. The incident and protest Late in the game with time winding down and Atlanta leading 124‚Äì122, the Bulls heaved a desperation shot that bounced off the rim, but Bulls center Tom Boerwinkle tipped it in to tie the game at 124 with one second left. However, Rakel waved off Boerwinkle's basket because he claimed he heard the final buzzer go off before it went in. Bulls coach Dick Motta and GM Pat Williams immediately got in Rakel's face. Despite both of them pointing right to the clock on the scoreboard, which showed one second left, and timekeeper Jim Serry flat-out telling Rakel he didn't touch the clock or buzzer, and further proving this by flipping the switch to run the clock to zero and allowing the buzzer to sound while the press corps watched him do it, Rakel (and an unnamed officiating partner of his, who deferred to him despite later admitting he didn't hear the buzzer sound either) refused to budge from his ruling and walked off the court declaring the game over and Atlanta the winners. Afterwards, Williams immediately filed an official protest with the NBA. After sorting through the evidence, commissioner Walter Kennedy upheld the protest. It was the first official protest to be upheld by the NBA, and the only one until 1982. Playing it out The game was ordered to be continued before the Hawks and Bulls' next scheduled game in Chicago with one second left, the game tied, and Atlanta in possession. Unfortunately, when the suspended contest resumed, the clock ran to zero without the buzzer sounding because the timekeeper forgot to set it. Despite Motta's embarrassment and Hawks coach Richie Guerin's mock protests, the officials working that game declared the second had expired and started the overtime period.

Its production can be split over 2 phases. The first of these running from 1960 and until approximately 1965, at which time a typical Fender Concert was priced at $315. During the 1960s, the Concert was for all practical purposes the same amplifier as the Vibrasonic but with four 10\\" speakers. In a later phase, the Concert was updated by Paul Riviera in the early 1980s (\\"concert\\" and \\"concert II\\") and a subsequent 1x12 variant of the Concert amp appeared briefly in the mid-1990s. Phase I: The 1960s The Fender Concert has gone through a number of changes over the years, both cosmetically and electronically.http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Twin-5C8-Schematic.pdf The Concert amp was introduced as a replacement for the 4-10 tweed Bassman amplifier. Due to the popularity of the Bassman, both amplifiers were produced concurrently during 1960. Unlike most of the other Professional Series amps however, the Concert (along with Fender Vibrasonic) were not previously offered as tweed-covered models in the 1950s. In late 1959, all of the Professional Series of Amps were debuted at the summer NAMM show. They sported a new light brown Tolex covering, solid state rectifiers (with the exception of the Super Amp), tweed style grill cloth and short-lived metal control knobs (later replaced with the more common brown plastic barrel knobs). In 1961 there was a short run of blond concert amps delivered to Webb music shop in California but the majority were transitioned to standard brown tolex with either maroon/obxlood grill cloth (1961) or the more common yellow or \\"wheat\\" cloth (1962). By the end of 1963 and into early 1964, the Concert amp transitioned into black tolex with silver grill along with the rest of the Fender Amplifier line. By approximately 1965, Fender decided on the Fender Super Reverb Amp as the only 4‚Äì10 model to continue. Fender Concert Amp, late 1959, early 1960, model 5G12. Apart from the variations in tolex and grill cloth color, the design of the Concert Amp as it appeared in the first phase (1960s) was largely consistent. The speaker configuration remained 4-10\\" speakers usually made by either Jensen or Oxford (for the earlier models) as opposed to Utah or CTS (for the later models). The Concert joined the Fender Twin Amp, and Fender Vibrasonic as the only models with the more robust and expensive \\"large-iron\\" output transformers. Over this period, the Concert offered vibrato, bass and treble controls delivering approximately 40 watts of power. There is some variation within the circuit itself corresponding with the model updates for the Concert starting with the 5G12 (late 1959, early 1960) and continuing with the 6G12 (in late 1960, early 1961) and the 6G12-A by 1962 into 1963. The next year the Concert transitioned to the blackface circuit, labeled AB763. The most significant of these updates occurred between the 5G12 which had only 5 preamp tubes and the 6G12 which added another tube for a more pronounced vibrato and more clean headroom. Ironically, the earlier distortion point of the 5G12 was seen by the design team as a design flaw but has become desirable over the decades that followed.

He was admitted as a fellow-commoner of Queens' College, Cambridge in 1617. In 1630 he was knighted. He served as MP for Hedon in the Short Parliament (Apr 1640) and Boroughbridge in the Long Parliament (Nov 1640). In 1642 he was appointed parliamentary commissioner in Yorkshire. When the civil war broke out he was made a colonel of horse and commander of the Earl of Essex's bodyguard. He commanded a brigade of cavalry at the Battle of Edgehill, one of two held in reserve until late in the day and whose charge against the flanks and rear of the Royal infantry almost secured a parliamentary victory but proved ultimately inconclusive. He also saw action at the Battle of Chalgrove Field and at the First Battle of Newbury. He was a member of the Committee of Safety appointed in 1642 and of the Committee of Both Kingdoms which replaced it in 1643. However, he fell out of favour when he opposed the Self-Denying Ordinance and the advancement of Oliver Cromwell. In 1647 he was one of the eleven members of Parliament impeached by the army, but managed to escape to Calais, and died there later the same year.

Austrian received his MD from Johns Hopkins University and did his fellowships in Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins and New York University. He went on to found the Infectious Diseases division and fellowship program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and held the endower Robert Herr Musser chair there from 1962-1986.

His Lasker award was for the development and clear demonstration of the efficacy of a purified vaccine of capsular polysaccharides in the prevention of pneumococcal disease. Prior to the Austrian polysaccharide vaccine scientists had prepared simpler whole bacteria and capsular polysaccharide vaccines but they were not accepted as standard of care by the medical community. Several medical authorities touted this era as ‚Äúthe end of infectious diseases‚Äù due to the remarkable mortality benefits derived from new antimicrobials and anti-parasitics and vaccine research was not thought to be worthwhile. When antibiotics came into use for the cure of pneumococcal infections in the 1950s and 60s, further pneumococcal vaccine development was abandoned. Austrian chose to focus on prevention rather than antibiotic treatment of this debilitating disease. Beginning with surveillance studies which he conducted revealed that despite antibiotic therapy, there were still, in the 1960s, almost half as many deaths from pneumonia in the United States as there were at the turn of the century. Austrian also established that persons over 50 years of age, and those with chronic debilitating diseases were the largest group at risk. Austrian established a tremendous knowledge base of pneumococcal biology. He analyzed 83 known types of pneumococci, and determined 14 types were responsible for 80% of invasive pneumococcal infections in man, and that the outer coatings or capsules of these organisms should be included in an effective vaccine. Austrian then devised a multi-valent polysaccharide vaccine and then played a major role in the successful clinical trials which resulted in its licensure. His Lasker award reads as follows ‚ÄúFor his persistent, dedicated efforts which permitted the development of a vaccine that soon may significantly reduce human disease caused by the pneumococcus, this Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award is given.‚Äù Robert Austrian also gives rise to the medical eponym \\"Austrian syndrome\\" which describes the clinical syndrome of pneumococcal meningitis, pneumonia and endocarditis, after his 1957 paper in Archives of Internal Medicine.

The design was created in the 1840s and was eventually widely used on passenger railway stock in the UK. This is an interesting example of a composite wooden wheel, using the same principle as an artillery wheel but with a solid wooden centre instead of spokes. The drawing (right) is from an old railway design bookRailway Mechanical Engineering, a practical treatise by engineering experts, Volume 1. the Gresham Publishing Company Ltd. London, 1923. The design and construction of carriages and wagons section by S Warner Carriage and Wagon Superintendent London and South Western Railway. from the early 20th Century. Overview A preserved Mansell wheel set at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre The reason for using wood was to reduce the noise. Having a wooden centre eliminated the ringing noise that emanated from early railway wheels. Made from teak this type of wheel endured for a long time. Besides the reduction in noise, there was an increased safety factor. While some of this might be attributed to the extra attention paid to what were specifically passenger carriage wheels, the potential for casting faults was also reduced. The wooden centres acted as electrical insulators so Mansell wheels would not operate the track circuits used in railway signalling. This problem was solved by fitting copper bonding to the wheels. Gazelle Mansell wheels were used almost exclusively on passenger coaches, but there some examples of their use on a locomotive. The Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway's 0-4-2WT locomotive \\"Gazelle\\" has trailing wheels of the Mansell type. \\"Gazelle\\" is preserved at the Colonel Stephens Railway Museum. The first examples built of the GWR 4-4-0 Duke class of 1895 also used Mansell wheels for their bogie and tender. Another tank locomotive 0-4-4T class bogie used Mansel (sic) wheels.  Re-use of wooden segments  The wooden segments of the wheel had a shorter life than other parts, and were replaced at intervals, usually because they had become loose in the wheel rim, not because the timber was otherwise damaged. This valuable teak was often re-used. As the segments were too short for most woodworking uses, they were typically re-used as wooden flooring blocks. These were particularly common for outdoor use in railway stations, around milk loading docks and platforms that handled postal traffic. These platforms were regularly in use overnight and the wooden blocks provided a quieter surface than cobblestones for the station's neighbours, even with iron-tyred carts running over them. An example of such a wood block pavement made from wheel segments survives at Liverpool's Edge Hill.

She was the lead guitarist in the British heavy metal band Girlschool (1984 to 1992, 2004) and has also provided session guitar work for other artists. Career Cris Bonacci was born at Myrtleford in north-eastern Victoria and grew up on a country farm close to Melbourne where her family had moved when she was \\"11 or 12\\" years old. She started playing the guitar soon after coming to Melbourne following her fascination with the instrument. Her introductions to music included her father's guitar playing and her uncle's membership of a band, as well as hearing flamenco guitar from her family's Spanish neighbours. She describes her own guitar style as \\"pretty much\\" self taught, aided by a few occasional guitar lessons (which included some jazz), but her main musical training came from listening to classic rock albums and practicing to them. In 1985, she declared that her main influences came from rock guitarists Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, along with early Black Sabbath's albums. Bonacci played in numerous bands in her native Australia, but never staying with one unit for more than a couple of years. She joined a rock group, Vixen, on lead guitar alongside Wendy Hemmings on drums (ex-Screeming Heep), Glenda Hunt on bass guitar and Robyn Youlten on lead vocals and lead guitar (ex-Screeming Heep). Bonacci and Sally Zylstra formed Sweet Jayne, in early 1975 in Melbourne with Robyn Clark on drums and Sally Zylstra on bass guitar. They advertised for a lead singer and found Chris Scheri who also played the flute. This band developed a sizeable local following in Melbourne and recorded several demos and an EP between 1977 and 1983. Their self-titled EP was issued in January 1980 and had five tracks, \\"Ambiguous Girl\\", \\"Omniscience\\", \\"Some People\\", \\"State of Mind\\" and \\"Crushed and Crazy\\". Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, opined that it \\"highlighted Bonacci's crunching guitar riffs offset by Scheri's melodic vocals and lilting flute lines.\\" Soon after Brendan O'Shea replaced Zylstra on bass guitar and John Zaffarese replaced Clark on drums. In October 1981 this line-up issued a single, \\"Icarus\\", with Fab Versace replacing Zaffarese on drums before being replaced in turn by Billy George in 1982. The group disbanded in January 1983. After Sweet Jayne, Bonacci went to the United Kingdom to work as session musician after being invited by Mike Oldfield. In London, Bonacci joined the all-female hard rock outfit She as lead guitarist. She included lead vocalist Jackie \\"Jacqui\\" Bodimead and former Rock Goddess bassist Tracey Lamb, whom Bonacci would later team up with in Girlschool. In fact, the all-female heavy metal outfit Girlschool was short of a lead guitarist after Kelly Johnson's departure and, on hearing Bonacci, they invited both her and keyboard player Bodimead to join the band. Both agreed and, during her time with Girlschool (1984 to 1992), Bonacci recorded the albums Running Wild, Nightmare at Maple Cross, Take a Bite and Girlschool, touring extensively all over the world. In a period of inactivity for Girlschool in 1990, she joined up with British rock singer Toyah Willcox, performing on GMTV to promote Willcox' album Ophelia's Shadow. In the years 1991 and 1992, Bonacci and Willcox (and Bonacci's bandmates in Girlschool Enid Williams and Kim McAuliffe) formed the short-lived band She Devils, which made two short tours around Europe. After the She Devils project, Bonacci finally left Girlschool and joined Marc Almond's touring band. In December 2004, however, Bonacci re-joined Girlschool for a one-off gig at the London Garage alongside original guitarist Kelly Johnson and current guitarist Jackie Chambers. She also played at the tribute gig for Kelly Johnson on 20 August 2007 in London. After leaving Girlschool, she worked also as a session guitarist and became a member of Jonathan Ross' house band for the British TV show Saturday Zoo, where she backed international artists such as Suzanne Vega, and k.d. lang. Bonacci wrote lyrics, music and produced for a variety of artists. She wrote mostly for the bands she was a member of, but she has also written for and produced other artists, such as All Saints and Samantha Fox. In 2003, Bonacci wrote and produced the song \\"Look Up\\" which was released on the dance compilation CD Fashion Lounge: Id Models, published in the US by Water Music Records. She also co-produced and engineered Dawne Adams' album Assume Nothing in 2004. She is currently affiliated with Electracult, a band she formed with Michelle Mullen in January 2005. Electracult released their first full-length release Electracult Me on 15 April 2008, on Renaissance Records. Since 2000, much of her focus has been on software training. In June, 2015, Bonacci was interviewed extensively about her musical career on the Australian Rock Show podcast. Equipment Her equipment in the 80s consisted of Gibson Les Paul guitars exclusively and Marshall 100 amps.

It was introduced in 1948 and discontinued in 1982.Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years An updated version was introduced in 2006 as part of the \\"Vintage Modified\\" line. The Champ had the lowest power output and the simplest circuit for all of the Fender tube amps. The Champ had only one power tube, and the power stage circuit is, typically, single-ended and class A. Five watts and the simple toneful circuit allowed the Champ to be used easily and often in recording studios.  Champion 800/600  First introduced in 1948, it sported the name \\"Champion 800\\" (with 8\\" speaker), changing a year later to \\"Champion 600\\" (6\\" speaker) with circuit designation 5B1. It was rated at about 3 watts, featuring a \\"T.V. Front\\" style cabinet; the 800 was covered in greenish fabric while the 600 featured two- tone blonde and brown vinyl covering. This style lasted until 1953, when Fender's cabinet style changed to the \\"Wide Panel\\" design with a tweed cloth covering. Fender also renamed the circuit the \\"5C1\\", \\"5\\" standing for the decade (1950s), \\"C\\" for the third circuit revision, and \\"1\\" was the Champ's circuit designation. The 5C1 circuit was extraordinarily simple, using one 6SJ7 pentode in the preamplifier section to provide a single stage of voltage amplification, one 6V6 beam power tetrode in the power amplifier section, a 5Y3 rectifier tube and a single volume knob with no tone controls. The Champ By 1955 Fender started putting its amps in the \\"Narrow Panel\\" tweed cabinet with a plastic oxblood color grill cloth, and by this time the Champ was officially named the Champ (model 5E1). Through 1957, Champs only had a six-inch speaker, but the 1958 model 5F1 featured an 8\\". The 5E1 and 5F1 circuits used a 12AX7 dual triode in the preamplifier to provide two stages of voltage amplification, and a single 6V6GT power tube to produce about 5 watts. A Champ from this era can easily be dated by the code stamped on the tube chart, by the code stamped on the speaker or by its serial number. Blackface/Silverface The 5F1 lasted until 1964, when the Champ finally made the transition to the \\"Blackface\\" style of circuit and cabinet. A small number of the last 5F1 style cabinets were covered with the \\"Blackface\\" amp cosmetics around this transition, as the factory most likely ran out of the tweed cloth covering. In 1964, a Champ with tremolo was also introduced. It was called the Vibro Champ. The Champ switched from Blackface to Silverface four years later. Fender brought back the blackface cosmetics for a short time in 1981 before discontinuing the Champ the following year. Champion 600 reissue In 2006, Fender \\"reissued\\" the Champion 600. Cosmetically similar to the original Champion 600, internally it features a modified blackface Champ circuit (with the settings of the tone stack being hard-wired rather than adjustable via Treble and Bass controls, and a couple of additional resistors reducing input-stage gain) and a switch to solid-state rectification from the original 5Y3 tube. The current look is the TV-front with two-tone tolex and speaker grille cloth of imitation suede. After Fender took on marketing, production and distribution for Gretsch, the same electronics were available with a different look and feel ‚Äì based on \\"tweed\\" Fender amps, despite the branding ‚Äì as the Gretsch G5222 Electromatic. Production of the Champion 600 reissue ceased in 2010 and was reintroduced by Fender in late 2014. As of 2016, the Champion 600 was once again discontinued.

It was first introduced in 1964 and discontinued in 1982. The Vibro Champ featured built-in tremolo with controls for speed and intensity. The silverface version served as a basis for the Bronco student amplifier of 1967.Fender Amps:The First 50 Years Vibro Champ XD In 2007, Fender reintroduced the Vibro Champ as the Vibro Champ XD, part of their \\"Vintage Modified\\" series. Aesthetically, the XD is based on the Champ from the blackface era. Unlike the Champion 600, which has a strictly all-tube audio signal path, the Vibro Champ XD's tube circuitry is complemented by a digital signal processor (DSP) that functions as a pre-amp by modelling 16 different amplifiers. The effect of the volume, gain and tone control knobs varies according to the selected amp model. The digitally modelled signal is fed into a class-A single-ended tube circuit, with a 12AX7 output tube driver, and a 6V6 output tube. The amp also comes equipped with DSP effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, tremolo, and Vibratone (there is no spring reverb tank). Specifications * Available as an 8\\" combo * 5 watt RMS class-A, single-ended * Controls: gain, volume, voicing, treble, bass, FX level, FX select * 1 input, 1 channel * 1 4 ohm speaker output, 1 line-level output (back panel) * 1√ó 12AX7 and 1√ó 6V6 * Solid-state diode-rectified * DSP provides 16 effects settings, including chorus, delay, tremolo, reverb, and Vibratone * Made in China Super Champ In 1982, in order to combat its decreasing amp sales, which at that time was around 10,000 units per year, Fender hired Paul Rivera (of Rivera Amplifiers) as Marketing Director to specify and help design a whole new range of amplifiers to meet the contemporary requirements of musicians. Even though he did not personally create the new designs, his direction of the engineering team, headed by Ed Jahns and Bill Hughes, resulted in some legendary amps, including the Super Champ. Featuring a push-pull output, 10\\" speaker, and spring reverb, as well as some new circuitry; master volume, a switchable extra gain stage for a 'lead' effect, and a mid-boost switch.Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years, p.69 The Super Champ utilized 1√ó 12AX7 for the first and second stage preamp, a 1√ó 12AT7 for spring reverb driver tube, whilst the three sections of the triple-triode 6C10 compactron serve as a recovery for the spring reverb, as a driver for the phase inverter, and as a split-load phase inverter. When the volume knob is pulled, some signal from the 12AT7 reverb driver is re-routed, resulting in higher gain. An optional two-button foot-switch allowed for gain switching and reverb on/off. Two 6V6GT power tubes provide it with 18 RMS watts. The cabinet was finished in black Tolex, with a black faceplate and silver grille cloth. The speaker was offered either with the standard Fender Blue Label, or optionally with a Fender-branded Electro-Voice EVI-10. Additionally, 100 Super Champ cabinets made of oak, fitted with EVI-10, having brown/champagne faceplate and knobs, and a special grille cloth were offered as part of the Super Pro Series. The Super Champ was sold until 1986. Along with the Concert amp, it was the last tube amp to be made by Fender under CBS ownership, and the last to be made at Fullerton.

It was discontinued in 1983, along with the Bassman 20 (with which it shared the same metal chassis design), three years before the rest of the range, perhaps because its dearth of features was unfashionable at the time. It had the same colour scheme, power supply, output stage and stock speaker as the Super Champ but the preamp and phase inverter consisted of two 12AX7 tubes.

The look is based on the blackface model. Although for a limited period of time a special edition Blonde version was produced, Fender‚Äôs Consumer Relations Department states that the blonde special edition Super Champ XD with oxblood grill was a FSR (factory special run) that was limited to only 1,000 produced. The blonde version is no longer available new and Fender has completed the amps' production run so no more will be produced or available from Fender. Unlike the Champion 600 (all tube circuitry), the Super Champ XD (like the Vibro Champ XD) is a hybrid (tube circuitry complemented with digital modeling and effects). Aside from one dual-triode 12AX7 and two 6V6 output tubes, it also has a digital signal processor (DSP) which models 16 different amplifiers and programs the volume, gain, and tone controls accordingly. It has two channels, channel 1 being a clean channel, and channel 2 having both clean and distortion voices, using modeling technology to provide 15 additional voices. Both the Bass/Treble EQ and Effects (FX) are global settings meaning they affect the sound of both channel 1 and channel 2. There are two stages of amplification: the first stage is done by solid-state op amps and the DSP, which also provide the desired voicing of the amps. It is then fed into the first triode of the 12AX7, which acts as a second stage preamp, provides the additional tube gain for both channels and acts as an interface between the solid-state circuitry and the tube circuitry. The second triode is a phase inverter, which creates mirror images of the signal to drive the output tubes. This arrangement provides the same feel of a complete tube amp while allowing multiple voicing. The DSP chip also provides effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, and tremolo. There is no spring reverb tank. In 2012, Fender released the Super Champ X2, a redesign of the XD. The X2 is designed to interface with the FUSE software used by the Fender Mustang series of modeling solid-state amplifiers, and is also available in both combo and discrete head/speaker cabinet units.

Early Career  From the age of 16, from 1926 to 1930, Miedinger apprenticed as a typographic composer with the printer Jacques Bollmann in Zurich. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked from 1930 to 1936 for various companies, while attending evening classes at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich. At 26 he went to work as a typographer in the advertising department of Globus, a renowned chain of department stores. After ten years at Globus, Miedinger gained employment with Haas Type Foundry as a representative. In 1954, he created his first typeface design for Haas, Pro Arte, a condensed slab serif.  Career  Helvetica, typeface designed by Max Miedinger Miedinger returned to Zurich as a freelance graphic designer when Edouard Hoffmann, director of the Haas foundry, commissioned him in 1956 to design a new Grotesk typeface.

Career=British Army Levita attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1886. He started his career as a soldier serving in the Second Matabele War and the Second Boer War where he was A.D.C. to Lieutenant-General Sir Baker Russell. He was later appointed a special service officer and a D.A.A.G. in the Natal Field Force. He was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Queen's medal with three clasps. He was created an MVO in 1901, and promoted to Major 5 February 1902. He retired from the army in October 1909. During the First World War he was recalled from the reserve to serve as General Staff Officer. After the war he was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel and made a CBE for \\"valuable services rendered in connection with the War\\". Politics In 1910 Levita contested the St. Ives division of Cornwall in the General Election as a Liberal Unionist but was unsuccessful. However, in 1911 he was elected at a by-election to the London County Council as a member of the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform Party, where he represented North Kensington for over 25 years. He sat on numerous committees including serving as chairman of the housing committee and chairman of the London County Council from 1928 to 1929. He was Knighted at the end of his term as chairman for \\"public and political services\\". He was largely responsible for founding the King George Hospital in Ilford to serve the population of the large LCC estate at Becontree. Levita was appointed a KCVO in 1932 \\"Talking Mongoose Case\\" His career was somewhat overshadowed by an episode in 1936 which became known as the \\"Talking Mongoose Case\\". Levita had alleged that Richard S. Lambert, the founding editor of The Listener was unfit to serve on the board of the British Film Institute (on which his wife served) because Lambert had published an article about a house which was supposedly haunted by Gef the talking mongoose. Lambert then brought an action for slander against Levita which he continued to pursue despite pressure from Sir Stephen Tallents, controller of administration and the chairman of the BBC Ronald Collet Norman who was a friend of Levita's.The BBC Under Pressure, The Mongoose Case, 1936. Lambert won substantial damages and the case prompted an enquiry launched by then Prime Minister into the rights of a public corporation to control the extraneous activities of their employees. The enquiry resulted in practices of the Civil Service being implemented within the BBC. Family On 30 May 1917 Levita married Florence Woodruff, widow of George Aman of Bucharest and daughter of William Robb. The couple had one son and one daughter. He died at his home in Hove, Sussex in October 1953 aged 86.

Grigoriev is remembered for his refined Empire style mansions, completion of Great Ascension Church (which, unfinished, housed the wedding of Alexander Pushkin in 1831) and assistance to Domenico Gilardi in rebuilding Moscow after the Great Fire of 1812. Biography Grigoriev was born a serf, owned by the Kretov family, and acquired freedom at the age of 22. By this time, he was a long-time apprentice to Moscow-based Gilardi family of Swiss architects. Giovanni Gilardi was the chief architect of continuously expanding Moscow Orphanage, Widow's House (public almshouse) and Catherine's Institute; his son, Domenico Gilardi, inherited the family practice and managed rebuilding of these and other public structures after the devastating Fire of 1812. Grigoriev, like Domenico, studied architecture and crafts in Francesco Camporesi workshop in Moscow Kremlin. In 1808-1847, Grigoriev was formally employed by the Widow's House, first as assistance to the Gilardis, then as the chief architect of this institution. Grigoriev worked for (or with) the Gilardis on all of their Moscow projects, growing from an apprentice to lead architect. He and Domenico Gilardi usually receive equal credit on their joint 1820s buildings, including Sukhanovo and Vlakhernskoye-Kuzminki. Grigoriev's own, undisputed, work can be found in Prechistenka Street, where he built two extant, adjacent upper-class houses. The first, a city estate of Alexander Khrushyov, is noted for a complex plan that integrates two different facades - a stern Ionic order facing Preschistenka and an ornate, joyful facade with double Ionic columns and a raised terrace overlooking Khruschyovsky Lane.

Both buildings retained all original exterior and some of interior artwork, and are rated as finest examples of Moscow Empire style. His most important project out of Moscow is the Ershovo estate near Zvenigorod. The Trinity Cathedral (1826‚Äì1828), destroyed in World War II, was rebuilt in 1990s (photo photo).

It lies within the premises of Rolls-Royce and other works sites. The line was opened by the British Railways Board for passengers on 4 October 1976 and closed in 1998. History=Melbourne Line The line was originally double tracked (with various sidings) and stretched to Chellaston Junction with the Castle Donington Line. Beyond this it carried on to Melbourne. This original line closed in 1930. Sinfin Branch Line The line reopened on 4 October 1976 for passengers. Derby City Council attempted to create a cross-city line, interworking with the Derwent Valley Line to Matlock. The service was poorly used because of the time of the last train and because it was served by only four trains per day. The service was reduced to a single early morning service in 1992, and the last train ran on 21 May 1993. The single service was replaced with a taxi that ran from Derby railway station. On 2 May 1997 the line became part of the Central Trains franchise on the privatisation of British Rail, but no Central Trains services ever used the line. On 6 November 1997 Central Trains and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising proposed the closure of the line. This was granted on 21 May 1998 by the Rail Regulator John Swift QC. Despite the line's closure the timetable continued to be called Sinfin-Derby to Matlock until the May 2001 timetable change and the train that used to run the line terminated at Peartree railway station until May 2001. The line had two stations: Sinfin North and Sinfin Central. Current status The line survives as a freight line serving the Rolls-Royce plant with a 0926 Thursdays only freight train carrying aviation fuel. Both platforms still exist, although Sinfin North railway station has become overgrown. There is occasional talk of reopening the line and extending it into Chellaston and onto East Midlands Airport but these look unlikely in the near future. As part of the closure decision neither station could be demolished until 21 May 2008.

United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1904), was a case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1903. The Court ruled 5 to 4 against the stockholders of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroad companies, who had essentially formed a monopoly, and to dissolve the Northern Securities Company. Facts In 1901, James Jerome Hill, president of and the largest stockholder in the Great Northern Railway, won the financial support of J. P. Morgan and attempted to take over the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;).Solomon, Brian. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. St. Paul, Minn.: MBI Publishing, 2005, p. 51. The Burlington served a traffic-rich region of the Midwest and Great Plains, was well-managed, and quite profitable. It possessed a finely-engineered line connecting the Twin Cities to the nation's rail center of Chicago, which made it particularly attractive as an addition to Hill's Great Northern. Hill's strategy was for his railroad and Morgan's Northern Pacific Railway to jointly buy the CB&Q.; However, Edward Henry Harriman, president of the Union Pacific Railroad and the Southern Pacific Railroad, also wanted to buy the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Harriman demanded a one-third interest in the CB&Q;, but Hill refused him. Harriman then began to buy up Northern Pacific's stock, forcing Hill and Morgan to counter by purchasing more stock as well. Northern Pacific's stock price skyrocketed, and the artificially high stock threatened to cause a crash on the New York Stock Exchange. Hill and Morgan were ultimately successful in obtaining more Northern Pacific stock than Harriman and won control of not only the Northern Pacific but also the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Pressured by Harriman's actions, Hill created a holding company‚Äîthe Northern Securities Company‚Äîto control all three of the railroads. The public was greatly alarmed by the formation of Northern Securities, which threatened to become the largest company in the world and monopolize railroad traffic in the western United States. President William McKinley, however, was not willing to pursue antitrust litigation against Hill. McKinley was assassinated, however, and his progressive Vice-President, Theodore Roosevelt, ordered the United States Department of Justice to pursue a case against Northern Securities. Judgment Justice Harlan held that the merger was unlawful. Justices Day, Brown, McKenna and Brewer concurred. Justice Holmes, joined by Fuller, White, Peckham, dissented. The Holmes dissent included the famous passage: \\"Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases are called great, not by reason of their real importance in shaping the law of the future, but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment.\\" Significance Hill was forced to disband his holding company and manage each railroad independently. The Northern Pacific, Great Northern, Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy companies would later merge in 1969. This is an example of Teddy Roosevelt's trust- busting procedures, prosecuting under the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890). This marked a major victory for the antitrust movement.

He was born into an elite Benin family; his father worked at the forestry department and was also a farmer in Benin. He attended the Baptist primary School in Benin and the Baptist High School, Ibadan for secondary education. After completing his secondary education, he took on a variety of duties, from being a transport clerk, to a sales agent and an accountant. It was while working as an accountant that he noticed the potential of trading in timber, especially the prospective wood resources available in the Southeastern part of the country. He left his job and formed a joint venture with two other partners to explore timber but the venture yielded little as timber prices crashed. After the closure of the venture, he started his own firm, Osagie & Sons. The new venture stayed in the timber business and finally found a successful way of selling timber. The company was advised to explore some areas where Toledo worms seemed to have caused some devastation on some trees. It was discovered that with inspection, and a few work, the core of the trees could be saved. He started exporting large scale timber from the area to Europe and America and was very successful. He was also an apolitical community leader, this allowed him to mediate on civil duties particularly does affecting the oil companies, their workers and the communities they operate in.

Virgin appears to Phillip Neri Biography He was born in Florence in 1604, and dedicated himself from a young age to artistic education, first as an apprentice to Jacopo Ligozzi, a Veronese artist active in Florence. When this master died, he passed to the school of Matteo Rosselli, where he remained until the age of 18 years. Finally he became a pupil of Domenico Passignano, and accompanied this master as his collaborator to Rome to work under the papacy of Pope Urban VIII. But in Rome he also worked on his own behalf, performing a Noli me Tangere for the church of San Caio (now destroyed) and produced a copy of Raphael's Transfiguration for Don Taddeo Barberini (now found in the church of the Cappuccini): the latter was praised by Passignano and Guido Reni, who said that \\"Mario had not copied it, but detached it from Raphael's painting\\". When he lost a commission for a painting depicting the Crucifixion (at first commissioned to Balassi, but finally entrusted instead to Joachim von Sandrart), he left the patronage of the Piccolomini and embarked on the journey through Italy. He stayed in Venice for some time, where he derived, according to Baldinucci, significant enrichments to his artistic personality. Returning to his homeland, he executed a significant number of altar paintings for many churches in Florence, Prato, and Empoli. For example in Florence, he painted a St Francis of Assisi for the Compagnia delle Stimmate. He also painted a Noli me tangere (Touch Me Not) for the convent of the Maddalena. For the church of Sant'Agostino, Prato, he painted a picture of St Nicolas of Tolentino. He died in Florence on 9 October 1667 and was buried in Santa Maria Novella. His art is visibly influenced by the heterogeneous education of his youth, as well as by the multiple orientations of the contemporaries and the different environments in which the artist found himself. If in some works the traces of Passignano and of Ligozzi are clearly recognizable, in others they play elements extraneous to the Florentine environment, probably acquired during the Roman stay; while in some, as in the San Nicola da Tolentino of Prato, the \\"echoes of the Flemish-Caravaggio world\\" are evident. Among the stylistic components of the eclectic painter, however, is the derivation from the art of Matteo Rosselli.

It was debuted as the first of the new-model Fender amps of the 1960s, with new tolex-covered cabinets and front-mounted control panels that would replace the tweed-covered, top-panel cabinets that were prevalent during the 1950s, as well as new circuitry which would characterize most Fender amplifiers for two decades. The Vibrasonic was introduced in 1959 and was discontinued in 1964. During this period, the \\"brownface\\" era, its brown control panel was matched with light brown (\\"tan\\") or standard brown tolex cabinets with grill cloth schemes typically in tweed style (\\"gold stripe\\") or yellow (\\"wheat\\"). At the time of its introduction, the Vibrasonic-Amp displaced the Fender Twin as the company's new top of the line or \\"flagship\\" model. This elevated status was short-lived however, as the new high-powered 6G8 blonde Twin-Amp appeared in mid 1960. The Vibrasonic was one of the seven models in the newly designated Professional Series The Pro, Super, Bandmaster, Concert, Vibrasonic, Twin and Showman. of Fender amplifiers. These amplifiers shared nearly identical circuits, with two (or four) 5881/6L6GC tubes in fixed-bias Class AB configuration, long-tailed pair phase inverters, and dual \\"normal\\" and \\"vibrato\\" channels with independent volume and tone controls; the models were differentiated only by cabinet/speaker configurations, transformers, and rectifiers. The tremolo (\\"vibrato\\") circuit which the Vibrasonic premiered and which gave it its name more closely resembled a Vox tremolo circuit than anything which Fender used before or after, a complex \\"harmonic vibrato\\" which created the illusion of true pitch-shifting. Two tubes (5G13 model) and later three tubes (6G13-A model) were used in the tremolo circuit alone and this perhaps explains why it was not widely used, and abandoned in the mid-1960s \\"blackface\\" amps. The 1√ó15 Vibrasonic, like the 4√ó10 Concert-Amp, featured a larger interleaved output transformer designed to minimize distortion and maximize clean headroom in the output stage. Unlike the Concert-Amp however, the Vibrasonic-Amp was the first production Fender amplifier to use a speaker made by the James B. Lansing company. JBL speakers were considered superior to the usual Jensen speakers in terms of their power handling capacity and frequency response. Only the prototypes of this amp were built with metal control knobs, as pictured in the 1960 Fender Musical Instruments catalog. In recent scholarship, the Vibrasonic has been closely associated with the mythical brown tolex, small-box Twin-Amp.

The higher the contention ratio, the greater the number of users that may be trying to use the actual bandwidth at any one time and, therefore, the lower the effective bandwidth offered, especially at peak times.UK OFCOM research report annex on broadband A contended service is a service which offers the users of the network a minimum statistically guaranteed contention ratio, while typically offering peaks of usage of up to the maximum bandwidth supplied to the user. Contended services are usually much cheaper to provide than uncontended services, although they only reduce the backbone traffic costs for the users, and do not reduce the costs of providing and maintaining equipment for connecting to the network.  Examples by country  In the United Kingdom, a Rate Adaptive Digital Subscriber Line (RADSL) connection used to be marketed with a contention ratio between 20:1 and 50:1 within the British Telecom network, meaning that 20 to 50 subscribers, each assigned or sold a bandwidth of up to 8 Mbit/s for instance, may be sharing 8 Mbit/s of downlink bandwidth.An account of the state of the issue in the UK is found in a 2004 OFCOM report on wireless internet. With the advent of ADSL2+ (up to 20 Mbit/s service, though in theory, ADSL2+ provides up to 24 Mbit/s), FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) offering 40 Mbit/s services and even FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) offering 100 Mbit/s, BT no longer work on \\"contention ratio\\" as a planning rule. In the United States and on satellite internet connections, the contention ratio is often higher, and other formulas are used, such as counting only those users who are actually online at a particular time. It is also less often divulged by internet service providerss elsewhere than it is in the UK. The connection speed for each user will therefore differ depending on the number of computers using the uplink connection at the same time because the uplink (where all the low bandwidth connections join) will only handle the speed that has been implemented on that line.  Issues  One of the issues with a stated contention ratio is that it is not, on its own, adequate for comparing services. There is a huge difference between 1000 users each on a 2Mbit/s service sharing a 40 Mbit/s pipe, and 50 users each on a 2 Mbit/s service sharing a 2 Mbit/s pipe. In the latter case two users trying to download at the same time means each get 50% of the speed. When there are 1000 users it would take 20 users using their entire 2Mbit/s link at the same time to show any congestion. However, both of these would be quoted as 50:1 contention. If there are a small number of users of a contended service, then the peaks and troughs in usage will be very visible to each user, but if the same contention ratio applies to a large number of users then the probability of being affected by the contention can be much smaller. In telephony, 20 users each likely to make a call 10% of the time need 8 lines to ensure that there is less than 0.1% chance of being blocked. With 200 users, the number of lines required is only 35, so that less than five times the number of lines are required for the same probability of being blocked. The same issue applies to broadband service.

The only away games they played were league games against Conroe Storm and an exhibition game against Beaumont Drillers. In the 2008 season, they appeared to have started again, but failed to play out the season. History The Regulators were also the Fort Worth Sixers of the NIFL. They played in the schedule slot of the Sixers (the NIFL was in its final season as a league at the time) who were also scheduled to play home games at the Cowtown Coliseum in the Fort Worth Stockyards. The NIFL put a deposit down to hold dates and were to follow up with the playing surface for a home game but the league was falling apart and they couldn't send a turf field. This left the team with no home dates. The Regulators were part of both the APFL and NIFL in 2007 and played both Beaumont and Conroe. Beaumont was a member of the NIFL and played the Regulators twice, defeating them both times. The Regulators played Conroe as a filler game because no APFL team scheduled for the date could make the travel. The 2008 season found the APFL as a league in turmoil as the Regulators played both Conroe and Beaumont, and also members at the time of the APFL on back to back dates. The Regulators' final game was held in the American Airlines Center in Dallas, where they faced Beaumont. The APFL decided after that game the Regulators would not finish the season schedule over a dispute over the game officials used. The APFL Commissioner wanted officials he sent to be used for a home game even though the Regulators were supposed to be able to use officials they chose. The league denied the Regulators remaining games be played. This shutdown also affected both Conroe and Beaumont as they were the only other Texas teams in the league. Both suffered as they lost out on games and essentially shutdown. The season ended with Beaumont putting half a team together to play for the APFL championship and folding afterwards. Conroe did the same. The Regulators were an outdoor football organization before entering the indoor game. They were 8‚Äì2 and 7‚Äì3 in the final two outdoor seasons involved in semi-pro football.

After two unsuccessful years in this grade, he was later added to the Cork junior team. A two-time Munster medal winner in this grade, he also won one All-Ireland medal. Creedon was added to the Cork senior panel in 1938. Over the course of the next ten years he remained as understudy to Tom Mulcahy, however, he did win his first All- Ireland medal in 1946. After retiring from inter-county hurling in 1949, Creedon was coaxed back to the Cork team in 1952. He went on to win a further three All-Ireland medals in-a-row between 1952 and 1954. Creedon also won five Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He played his last game for Cork in June 1955. In retirement from playing Creedon served as an administrative officer and as a selector with Glen Rovers. Playing career=ClubEarly successes= Creedon first enjoyed success as a member of the Glen Rovers minor team. He won back-to-back county championship medals in 1933 and 1934, before later being added to the Glen Rovers senior panel. In 1940 he took over from Mick Casey as first-choice goalkeeper, as the Glen qualified for a seventh successive county championship final against Sarsfields. A remarkable feature of the game was the scoring of seventeen goals which remains a record for a county final. Charlie Tobin scored six of those goals as Glen Rovers secured a 10-6 to 7-5 victory. It was Creedon's first county senior championship medal. Glen Rovers continued their remarkable run of success in 1941 by qualifying for an eight successive championship decider. A Willie \\"Long Puck\\" Murphy-inspired Ballincollig provided the opposition, however, they were completely outplayed. The Glen recorded a 4-7 to 2-2 victory, setting the all-time record of eight championship titles in succession. It was Creedon's second successive winners' medal. Nine-in-a-row proved beyond Glen Rovers as Ballincollig exacted their revenge in the semi- final of the 1942 championship. After a season of reorganisation, which saw the introduction of nine new players to the team, Glen Rovers reached the 1944 championship final where they faced reigning champions and three-in-a-row hopefuls St. Finbarr's. The game started at a furious pace and inside a minute Denis Leahy had the ball in the St. Finbarr's net. This lead was increased to 2-3 after 27 minutes. \\"The Barrs\\" replied with a goal and at half time the Glen led by 4-3 to 1-0. A St. Finbarr's goal at the three-quarter mark was immediately cancelled out by an own goal, however, the final quarter was fought out score for score. At the final whistle Glen Rovers were the champions by 5-7 to 3-3 and Creedon had collected his third championship medal. Divisional side Carrigdhoun provided the opposition as Glen Rovers reached the 1945 championship final in search of their tenth title. In what was probably the most exciting decider in which the club had been involved in so far, the Glen were five goals ahead after 25 minutes having played with a gale force wind, however, Carrigdhoun fought back to reduce the arrears and set up an exciting finish. Lyons was single dout for praise at full-back as Glen Rovers retained the championship title following a 4-10 to 5-3 victory. =Glen Rovers march on= After defeat by St. Finbarr's in the 1946 championship final, Glen Rovers saw a number of changes to the team when they next contested the decider in 1948. Retirement and emigration and forced a number of changes, however, Creedon remained in goal. Glen veterans Jack Lynch and Johnny Quirke were to the fore in securing the double scores 5-7 to 3-2 victory over roll of honour leaders Blackrock. Glen Rovers were presented with their chance of retaining their title when they faced divisional side Imokilly in the 1949 championship decider. On a day of incessant rain, the game was described as one of the best of the year. Donie Twomey and Jack Lynch were the stars of the team as they bagged 5-2 between them. Christy Ring scored the Glen's sixth goal of the game to secure the 6-5 to 0-14 victory. It was a sixth medal for Creedon, who also had the honour of lifting the Se√°n √ìg Murphy Cup as captain. Southside rivals St. Finbarr's were the opponents as Glen Rovers were determined to make it three titles in-a-row in the 1950 championship final. St. Finbarr's had the advantage of a very strong breeze in the first half and mounted attack after attack on the Glen goal but failed to raise the green flag. The Glen backs gave one of the finest displays of defensive hurling ever seen in the championship and kept the southsiders tally for the first half to 0-4. \\"The Barrs\\" added just one further point to their tally after the interval. The 2-8 to 0-5 victory secured a third successive championship title for the club and a seventh winners' medal for Creedon. =Final victories= Sarsfields ended the Glen's hopes of four-in-a-row in 1951, while defeat in the first round of 1952 looked like heralding a fallow period. The club returned stronger than ever when they qualified for the 1953 championship final where they faced Sarsfields once again. After a slow start Glen Rovers gave an exhibition of hurling all over the field, with Creedon, John Lyons, Se√°n French and Se√°n O'Brien proving impregnable in defence. The 8-5 to 4-3 victory secured his eighth championship medal. In 1954 Glen Rovers reached their 17th championship final in twenty years. Blackrock fielded a young team, however, Glen Rovers had eight inter-county players on their team. In spite of this, Blackrock stood up to the champions and the result remained in doubt to the end. A 3-7 to 3-2 victory secured an eighth and final championship medal for Creedon. Inter-county Creedon played with the Cork minor hurling team in the mid-1940s. He was a member of the senior panel when Cork won the Munster Championship in 1947, however, he had yet to make his own championship debut. He won his first All-Ireland medal when he was sub goalkeeper in the 1946 final. In 1952 Creedon came out of retirement at the age of 33 to become the first-choice goalkeeper on the Cork senior hurling team. It proved to be an excellent decision as he won his first Munster title that year before later defeating Dublin to claim his first All-Ireland medal. 1953 began well for Creedon when he won his first National Hurling League title. Later that year he won his second consecutive Munster medal as well as a second consecutive All-Ireland medal following an ill-tempered win over Galway. In 1954 Creedon made it a hat-trick of Munster and All-Ireland medals as a defeat of Wexford gave the team its third All-Ireland title in-a-row. In 1955 Cork were defeated by Clare in the first round of the championship. Creedon subsequently retired from inter-county hurling.

A staunch nationalist, he was elected head of the Second League of Prizren.  Biography = Early life Rexhep was born to a wealthy land-owning family from Mitrovi√ßa (currently Mitrovica, Kosovo), in the Ottoman Empire. He studied in Usk√ºb and Istanbul. He was one of the leaders of the Kosovo uprising of 1912, together with Isa Boletini and Hasan Prishtina. Also in 1912, he took part in the declaration of Albanian independence as the representative of Peja. From 1921 to 1923, he served as Albanian minister of education. By 1921, Kosovo was within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes against the will of the Albanian population majority. Albanian resistance had been largely crushed in Drenica in November 1920. The Serbian government's Decree on the Colonization of the New Southern Lands was now facilitating the takeover by Serb colonists of large Ottoman estates and of land seized from Albanian rebels. It is within this context that Rexhep Mitrovica, along with Bedri Pejani, tried to seek help from the western powers. After the fall of the government of Fan Noli in December 1924, he took part in a failed plot to overthrow Ahmet Zogu, spent a couple of years in exile in Austria and France, but was amnestied with seventy other figures on 21 September 1927. He returned to Albania after the Italian invasion and joined the Balli Komb√´tar resistance movement in 1942. He spent much of the Italian period in prison in Porto Romano near Durr√´s. Prime minister After the capitulation of Italy, Rexhep Mitrovica was head of the Second League of Prizren, which supported Greater Albania, i.e., unification of all territories with substantial Albanian population. After German occupation of Albania, on November 6, 1943, Berlin announced that the regents and the assembly had formed a government headed by Rexhep Mitrovica, an active member of the Balli Komb√´tar from Kosovo. Mitrovica's cabinet, most of whom had credentials as nationalists as well as some German or Austrian connection, included Xhafer Deva, who had studied at the Robert College of Istanbul and in Vienna, as minister of the interior and Rrok Kolaj, a Catholic from Shkod√´r who had studied at the University of Graz, as minister of Justice. Austrian educated Vehbi Frasheri was appointed as foreign minister. The Orthodox Elbasaner, Sokrat Dodbiba, the nephew of Lef Nosi, became minister of finance. In his first address to the National Assembly, Mitrovica noted that four and a half years of Italian domination had left anarchy and chaos in Albania. The pre-1939 state apparatus had been completely dismantled. The Italians had destroyed the army, the gendarmerie, the police, and the Foreign Ministry; they had changed the flag, altered personal greetings, renamed cities, and even reassigned family names. To reestablish the state, Mitrovica set down an ambitious plan that included reestablishing local government on the pre-1939 basis, gaining foreign recognition, reorganizing the economy, introducing effective agrarian reform, and creating a military force. The general goal of the government, and this was repeated at every available opportunity, was to protect Albania's territorial integrity within its ethnic borders. With the land reforms for the peasants and a very effective German propaganda emphasizing the return of Kosovo, the Germans managed to extract considerable support from the regime. With control over Kosovo and the creation of an Independent State of Albania, Mitrovica exacted revenge on the Serb colonists, killing and expelling thousands of Serbs. On July 18, 1944, Rexhep Mitrovica resigned due to illness. Hermann Neubacher, Hitler's political expert for Balkan problems, came to Tirana and persuaded Fiqri Dine to form the next government Exile and death During the communist takeover in November 1944, though he was ill with tuberculosis, he managed to escape to Croatia with Xhafer Deva and Rexhep Krasniqi, and in December of that year carried on over the mountains to Austria to reach Vienna. With Deva‚Äôs assistance, the ailing Mitrovica spent time in a sanatorium in Feldkirch in western Austria. In 1947, he accompanied Deva and Krasniqi to Genoa where, with the help of a Turkish diplomat of Albanian origin, he was able to immigrate to Turkey. He died at the German hospital in Istanbul as head of the Albanian community in exile. His grandson, Redjep Mitrovitsa is an actor of Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Quotes Mitrovica identified the Albanian communists as un-Albanian since he argues that: \\"Albanians, as Aryans of Illyrian heritage, could not ignore tradition and would be saved from the hydra of communism.\\" Sources *Owen Pearson, Albania and King Zog: Independence, republic and monarchy 1908-1939, London, Tauris, 2004, . *Owen Pearson, Albania in occupation and war: From fascism to communism, 1940-1945, London, Tauris, 2005, .

Consisting of two brothers' from Cincinnati, Ohio; Gerald Brown & Terry Brown; Judy Jones, Patricia Williamson (replaced by Denise Smith in 1976) and Hollis Pippin, the Soul Train Gang recorded its debut album, Don Cornelius Presents the Soul Train Gang, in 1975.

Software was sold both by Atari, Inc. (then Atari Corporation starting in mid-1984) and third parties. Atari also distributed software through the Atari Program Exchange from 1981 to 1984. After APX folded, many titles were picked up by Antic Software.  Programming languages =Assembly language Atari, Inc. published two assemblers. The Atari Assembler Editor cartridge is a friendlier, integrated development environment on using line numbers for editing source code similar to Atari BASIC. The professionally targeted Atari Macro Assembler shipped at a higher price on a copy protected disk without editor or debugger. Third-party assemblers include SynAssembler from Synapse Software and MAE (Macro Assembler Editor) from Eastern House. Optimized Systems Software published an enhanced disk-based assembler mimicking the structure of Atari's Assembler Editor as EASMD (Editor/Assembler/Debug). It followed that with MAC/65 (first on disk with BUG/65 as a companion product, then as a 16KB bank-switched cartridge). MAC/65 tokenizes lines of code as they are entered and has much faster assembly times than Atari's products. Dunion's Debugging Tool (or DDT) by Jim Dunion is a machine language debugger originally sold through the Atari Program Exchange. A reduced version is included in the cartridge version of MAC/65. Atari magazine ANALOG Computing published the machine language monitor H:BUG as a type-in listing. followed by BBK Monitor. BASIC Atari shipped Atari BASIC with all their machines either as a cartridge or in ROM. It also sold Atari Microsoft BASIC on disk. Optimized Systems Software created a series of enhanced BASICs: BASIC A+, BASIC XL, BASIC XE. BASIC compilers were also available, from 1982's ABC (Monarch Data Systems) to two releases from 1985: Advan BASIC and Turbo BASIC XL. Pascal Atari's own Atari Pascal requires two disk drives and was relegated to the Atari Program Exchange instead of the official product line. Later options were Draper Pascal and Kyan Pascal. Forth Atari 8-bit Forths include fig-Forth, Extended fig-Forth (Atari Program Exchange), ES-Forth, QS Forth, and ValFORTH. Other Action! is an ALGOL 68-like procedural programming language that shipped on cartridge with an integrated compiler and full-screen text editor. The language is designed for quick compile times and to generate efficient 6502 machine code. Deep Blue C is a port of Ron Cain's Small-C compiler. It was sold through the Atari Program Exchange. Atari, Inc. published versions of Atari Logo and Atari PILOT on cartridge. Other Atari 8-bit family languages include Extended WSFN and Inter-LISP/65. Applications : See :Category:Atari 8-bit family software. Word processors Atari, Inc. published the Atari Word Processor in 1981, followed by the more popular AtariWriter cartridge in 1983. Third party options include PaperClip, Letter Perfect, Word Magic, Superscript, Bank Street Writer, COMPUTE! magazine's type-in SpeedScript, The Writer's Tool, Muse Software's Super-Text, and relative latecomer The First XLEnt Word Processor in 1986. Cut & Paste from Electronic Arts and Homeword from Sierra On-Line were designed to be simpler to use than other programs. Two integrated software packages that include word processing are HomePak and Mini Office II. Antic compared seven word processors in the February 1987 issue of the magazine. Games : See :Category:Atari 8-bit family games. Because of graphics superior to that of the Apple II and Atari's home-oriented marketing, the Atari 8-bit computers gained a good reputation for games. BYTE in 1981 stated that \\"for sound and video graphics [they] are hard to beat\\". Jerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine in 1982, when trying to decide what computer to buy his sons, that \\"if you're only interested in games, that's the machine to get. It's not all that expensive, either\\". Star Raiders was Atari's killer app, akin to VisiCalc for the Apple II in its ability to persuade customers to buy the computer. Antic in 1986 stated that \\"it was the first program that showed all of the Atari computer's audio and visual capabilities. It was just a game, yes, but it revolutionized the idea of what a personal computer could be made to do.\\" A 1984 compendium of reviews used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all others. It noted the existence of a distinct \\"graphics look\\" to native Atari software: \\"Multiple graphics modes, four directional fine scrolling, colorful modified character-set backgrounds, and, of course, player missile graphics\\".

The dam is named after nearby village ≈†tƒõchovice. The construction started before World War 2 and because of the need for electricity resources were allocated for the project in spite of general shortage. The power station was put in action in 1943. The reservoir had flooded St John's Rapids (Svatoj√°nsk√© proudyhttp://www.svatojanske-proudy.cz/), the most dangerous but romantic part of Vltava. The main role of the reservoir is to balance the water runoff from peak-load power station at Slapy Dam and to propel two Kaplan turbines with total installed power 2 x 11.25 MW (≈†tƒõchovice I). A lock (20.1 m difference between water levels, length 118 m) handles ships with displacement up to 1,000 tons. The reservoir is also used by the pumped- storage hydroelectric plant ≈†tƒõchovice II whose upper reservoir was created on the top of hill Homole. The plant was set in operation in 1947 and closed in 1991 due to obsolescence. From 1992 to 1996 a new hydroelectric plant using the reservoirs was built. This plant uses reverse Francis turbine with power 45 MW. During 2002 floods the turbines of both power plants were severely damaged.

B. West, was the 6th Chief Usher of the White House serving from 1957 to 1969. His best- selling book, Upstairs at the White House: My Life with the First Ladies (with Mary Lynn Kotz), documents his time in the executive mansion and is considered a good source of material on the First Families he served. Biography West was born in Afton, Iowa, on July 27, 1912, to William and Sarah ( McVey) West. He graduated from Creston High School in 1930 and moved to Washington in 1939, where he worked in the Veterans Administration. West began work in the White House as assistant to the chief usher, Howell G. Crim, on March 1, 1941. He was promoted to Chief Usher when Crim retired in 1957. He was responsible for taking care of all activities occurring in the Executive Residence. Letitia Baldrige, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy social secretary, called him \\"the miracle maker of the White House\\". Mrs. Kennedy herself gave him a vermeil cigarette case inscribed \\"With deep appreciation for Jan. 20, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963\\" with the following letter, ‚ÄúDear Mr. West, This little gold box is a sad substitute for the Citation of Merit which President Kennedy was going to give you this last Fourth of July, for all that you did for your country for so many years, serving four Presidents with such extraordinary energy, tact and devotion. I had it made early this year when I knew he would never be able to give it to you himself in his beloved Rose Garden, which you also made possible. Dear Mr. West, you can imagine the words President Kennedy would have said about you in the Citation. I was looking forward with such joy to hearing him that day and to seeing you, whose passion is anonymity, and whose contribution has never been known except by Presidents. But please accept some additional words from me‚Äîyou, more than anyone else, made our brief years in the White House so full of happiness. I will be grateful to you forever for all that you did for him, his last years were his happiest ones in spite of all the agony of the decisions he had to make in those years. Neither you nor I will ever forget him. Please accept this from me in lieu of so much more, in memory of President Kennedy and with the devotion of both of us. Sincerely, Jacqueline Kennedy‚Äù West oversaw the transition of Johnson to the White House following Kennedy's assassination. With a staff of 72 and budget of $750,000, West oversaw the day-to-day operation of the White House, the executive mansion's maintenance and renovation, and planning and execution of both formal and informal White House events. These included the funeral of John F. Kennedy and the wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson. West announced his retirement from the White House on November 14, 1968. West left the White House on March 1, 1969. According to author Ronald Kessler,Inside the White House, 1995, Pocket Books, during the Nixon administration an investigation found that West used to let friends into the White House for after hours tours and some of them had stolen White House mementos and chinaware. It also found that West was a homosexual. For that reason the administration considered him a blackmail/security risk and dismissed him in 1969. Although West said he had no intention of writing his memoirs, in 1973 he wrote Upstairs at the White House: My Life With the First Ladies. It became a best-seller. Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post later characterized West's book as one of two of the most useful memoirs written by a White House staffer, President, First Lady, or member of the First Family. West died on July 18, 1983, at Northern Virginia Doctors Hospital (now Virginia Hospital Center) in Arlington County, Virginia, of respiratory failure. He was survived by his wife of 40 years, Zella, and his daughters Sally West and Kathy West Langhoff. ReferencesBibliography * * External links *Records of the White House Usher, Dwight D.

It was primarily a Silverface Bandmaster piggyback 'head' with the addition of reverb and vibrato and a modified circuit that shared more similarities with other Fender amplifiers. It was introduced in 1968 and was discontinued in 1980 .The Bandmaster Reverb was produced in both a 40 watt and 70 watt tube variant, before being reissued as a vintage modified amplifier.  History  The first version of the Fender Bandmaster Reverb was introduced in 1968 as a Silverface Bandmaster that offered reverb on the vibrato channel. Fender introduced the amplifier with a 5U4GB rectifier tube rather than the diode rectifier found in the previous Blackface Bandmaster. This resulted in the Bandmaster Reverb having reduced power over the standard model and increased sag and power amp break up. The revised circuit also places the gain stage within the reverb recovery circuit which causes the amp to break up earlier These series amps offer the designations AA768, AA568, AA1069, and TFL5005. A revised model was introduced 1978 that increased power output from 40 watts to 70 watts. it offered a larger power and transformer and larger filter caps. This increased the headroom of the amp and brought it more inline with the non-reverb versions. This was complemented by the added functionality of a master volume and a push/pull boost. Some of these models also added a mid knob and a bright switch but this was not common across all models. Master volume models with \\"pull boost\\" tone circuit, a Mid control knob for the Normal channel and a tailless amp decal were introduced in 1976. Power was increased from 40 to 70 watts/RMS; Line Out jack, hum balance pot and an ultra-linear output transformer were added in 1977.Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years The amp was reissued in 2009 as the Band-Master VM (Vintage Modified series), and features many of the characteristics of the original. It is however largely a different amp as it models the blackface variants of the Bandmaster bad adds reverb. On top of this it deviates from the traditional Bandmaster reverb formula in its use of a hybrid preamp section which utilises 12ax7 tube power alongside a DSP section.

It was founded in 1570 under the auspices of Charles IX of France by the poet Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf and the musician Joachim Thibault de Courville.Grove, AcademyFremy 1887.Yates 1988, pp. 14‚Äì35. Jean- Antoine de Ba√Øf The purpose of the Acad√©mie was to revive Classical Greek and Roman poetry and music. It met regularly at Ba√Øf's house in Paris, and had two classes of members ‚Äî \\"musicians\\", or poets, singers and instrumentalists; and \\"auditors\\", or subscribers who helped support the academy financially. Ba√Øf's intention was to revitalise and transform French poetry by applying the ancient metres (vers mesur√©s √† l'antique) to it, and combining it with simple music following ancient metres (musique mesur√©e √† l'antique). Although the ostensible purpose of the Acad√©mie was musico-poetic, Ba√Øf's goals were much more ambitious ‚Äì he hoped that through a structuring of French poetry, he might bring about a more structured social order and morality. This goal followed from Neo-Platonic ideals, where music and morality are closely linked. To this end, discussions were not limited to music and poetry, but also included discussions of Natural philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects. Ba√Øf was influenced at least in part by the Accademia Platonica of Marsilio Ficino in Florence. Other influences on the creation of the Acad√©mie were the teacher and poet Jean Daurat, Pierre de Ronsard, and other members of La Pl√©iade, a literary group. Despite Ba√Øf's goals of spreading his philosophy, the Acad√©mie kept the art of measured poetry and music a secret.Grove, Ba√Øf Claude Le Jeune In order to help further his goals, Ba√Øf enlisted the help of French musicians, the most influential of whom was Claude Le Jeune. Le Jeune's experiments influenced musical setting of French poetry, including the use of irregular metres in the air de cour, for several generations, despite the influence of the academy itself being much shorter in duration. Other musicians involved included Eustache du Caurroy and Jacques Mauduit.Rare Materials Digital Services at UVA When Charles IX died, the Acad√©mie became far less active. It had a renaissance for a short time under Henry III of France when it met in the Louvre under the name Acad√©mie du Palais. At this time Guy du Faur de Pibrac took over, and the focus of the group shifted to oratory and debate. References ;Notes ;Sources * Brown, Howard Mayer; Iain Fenlon (2001). \\"Academy 4.

He is mostly known in the West, via an alternative transliteration of his name, Krivosheev, as the editor of a book on Soviet military casualties in the 20th century, which was translated and published in English. Biography Grigoriy Krivosheyev was born in the village of Kinterep, Legostayevsky (now Maslyaninsky District) of the Novosibirsk Oblast (province) in western Siberia. He was a graduate of the Frunze Military Academy. A Ph.D. (Kandidat nauk) in military science, from 1995 Krivosheyev is a professor in the Russian Academy of Military Sciences.

With Krivosheyev being the general editor of the book, this analysis prepared by historians based on declassified Soviet archival data represents the first comprehensive attempt to scientifically address the losses of the armed forces of the former Soviet Union during World War II. Previously, the number of human casualties was mostly a matter of political speculations, and widely fluctuated with changes in political expediencies. In 1997 Krivosheyev's book was translated and published in English under the title of Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century. A follow-up book also under editorship of Krivosheyev addressed Russian and Soviet combat losses in the wars of the 20th century, titled Russia and the USSR in the Wars of the Twentieth Century: Losses of the Armed Forces. A Statistical Study, was published in Moscow in 2001. Commentary on Krivosheev Krivosheev's analysis has generally been accepted by historians, however his study has been disputed by some independent researchers in Russia. His critics maintain that he underestimated the number of missing in action and POW deaths (In Russian) and deaths of service personnel in rear area hospitals. Makhmut Gareev former Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR maintains that the published information on Soviet casualties is the work of the individual authors and not based on official data. According to Gareev the Russian government has not disclosed the actual losses in the war.Makhmut Gareev, Battles on the military historical front(in Russian), Moscow 2008. p.496 In 2000 S. N. Mikhalev published a study of Soviet casualties. From 1989 to 1996 he was an associate of the Institute of Military History of the Ministry of Defence. Mikhalev disputed Krivosheev's figure of 8.7 million military war dead, he put the losses of the at more than 10.9 million persons based on his analysis of those conscripted. He maintained that the official figures cannot be reconciled to the total men drafted and that POW deaths were understated.Mikhalev, S. N (2000). Liudskie poteri v Velikoi Otechestvennoi voine 1941‚Äì1945 gg: Statisticheskoe issledovanie (Human Losses in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945 A Statistical Investigation). Krasnoiarskii gos. pedagog. universitet (Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University). pp.18-23 . (In Russian) Mikhalev put total irreplaceable losses at 13.7 million, he believed at the official figures understated POW and missing losses, the deaths of service personnel convicted of offenses were not included with overall losses and the number that died of wounds was understated.Mikhalev, S. N (2000). Liudskie poteri v Velikoi Otechestvennoi voine 1941‚Äì1945 gg: Statisticheskoe issledovanie (Human Losses in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945 A Statistical Investigation). Krasnoiarskii gos. pedagog. universitet (Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University). pp.26-28 . (In Russian) German historian Roman T√∂ppel, in his 2017 book on the battle of Kursk (written after consulting all available armies and units archives), noted that Krivosheev's figures for the Battle of Kursk are underestimated, probably by 40% Krivosheev did maintain POW and MIA losses of the combat forces were actually 1.783 million, according to Krivosheev the higher figures of dead includes reservists not on active strength, civilians and military personnel who were captured in the war.

Scieszka says, \\"It kind of came out of my experience both as growing up a guy, for starters, and then going into elementary school teaching, where I found that the guy sensibility isn't really appreciated there, mostly that the world of elementary school is probably like 85% women - teachers and librarians.\\" As for how exactly to motivate boys to read, Scieszka says, \\"I think the best way to do it is to give them things they like to read... What we haven't done with boys is we haven't really given them a broad range of reading.

Owned and operated by the Comisar family and located since 1966 at 114 E. 6th Street in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Maisonette boasted the longest running streak of five-star awards, the highest designation given by Mobil Travel Guide. That streak ended at 41 years when the Maisonette closed. Opinions vary on what caused the restaurant to lose its luster. Fewer people frequented the luxury restaurant, operating costs increased, and the City of Cincinnati refused to offer a tax break to the downtown landmark. The Maisonette had plans to move to Kenwood, a suburb of Cincinnati, where it would reinvent its image, hoping to attract a more modern, younger crowd; however, the Hamilton County Planning Commission rejected zoning for the proposed Sycamore Square project, a $60 million development that included a relocated Maisonette as the anchor tenant. Instead, the top-rated French cuisine restaurant auctioned off all of its assets through a two-day auction hosted by the Great American Group auction firm. The most expensive item sold at auction was the Maisonette's name/logo, which sold for $35,000. The restaurant originally opened in 1949. In 1964 the restaurant won its first 5-star rating from Mobil.

The 75th Battalion was authorized on 10 July 1915 and embarked for Great Britain on 29 March 1916. It disembarked in France on 12 August 1916, where it fought as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was disbanded on 15 September 1920. History The 75th Battalion was authorized on 10 July 1915. Recruitment was undertaken in Toronto, Hamilton and London, Ontario and the unit was mobilized at Toronto.Meek, John F. Over the Top! The Canadian Infantry in the First World War. Orangeville, Ont.: The Author, 1971. The 75th was formed by Lieutenant Colonel Samuel G. Beckett, who had been trained as a cavalry officer in the 9th Mississauga Horse. Following training in Niagara and Toronto, the 75th left for overseas on 29 March 1916 and arrived on 9 April 1916. On arrival in England they formed part of the newly created 11th Brigade of the 4th Canadian Division and saw their first action in the trenches in Belgium in August 1916. Within the month, the 75th Battalion was at the Somme and fought with great distinction in the battles at the Regina and Desire Trenches. In December, the 75th had been moved to Vimy Ridge, immediately after taking part in the assault on the Regina Trench, where they, with the rest of the Canadian Army dug in, prepared for, and waited until the great assault on 9 April 1917. On the night of February 28 ‚Äì 1 March 1917, the 75th, along with the 72nd, the 73rd, and the 54th Battalions were chosen to conduct a multi-battalion sized raid on German positions at Hill 145 at Vimy Ridge in preparation for the larger assault 5 weeks later. A total of 1,700 personnel of all ranks participated in this large scale raid, 491 (all ranks) participating from the 75th. The defensive position was manned by soldiers of the 261st Regiment \\"Section Fischer\\" in the centre, on the left as the Canadians attacked, was the 16th Bavarian Infantry Division, and the 262nd Regiment \\"Section Zollern\\" on the right.Canadian Military History, Vol. 15 [2006], Iss. 1, Art. 7 pp. 73‚Äì74 All 75th Battalion troops were ready at their jumping off point just behind the Snargate Trench by 0250 hours. Phosgene gas had been released by the Canadians prior to going \\"over the top\\". The gas release had alerted the defenders that an attack was forthcoming, and the alarm was raised. German shells began a steady fire on the Canadian lines, some hitting canisters of Chlorine gas that had been brought forward but not deployed. The Battalion had to wait until the gas cleared before advancing. A second wave of gas released by the 12th Brigade rolled down no-mans land right on top of the 75th, further delaying the assault. By this time the Germans were fully prepared, and waiting. After waiting for their own artillery barrage, they finally advanced at 0547 hours. The German defences were too strong to breach, especially on the right of the battalion's attack, and the battalion had no choice but to retire to the comparative safety of their own lines. The raid was especially costly, as it claimed the life of the Commanding Officer, LCol S.G. Beckett, and the numerous casualties (9 Officers, 112 other ranks killed, missing or wounded) so depleted the battalion that its participation in the multi- divisional assault of Vimy Ridge on 9 April 1917 was as a weakened battalion in the 11th Brigade, behind the 87th Battalion, the 102nd Battalion, and the 11th Canadian Machine Gun Company. Elements of the 75th attacked in the first wave at 0530 hrs in front of the Tottenham Trench on a particularly stubborn German sniping position. By 1500 hours the area was reported clear with 40 prisoners captured.War Diary, 75th Battalion, C.E.F. entry 9-4-17 One member of the 75th Battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross. Medical Officer Captain Bellenden Hutcheson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 2 September 1918 at the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line. The battalion was disbanded on 15 September 1920.

Biography Den Ouden was a daughter of Willemijntje Kuipers and Antonius Victor Jozephus den Ouden, a caf√© owner in Rotterdam, a town that was then the swimming center of the Netherlands. in 1931, at the age of 13, she became the Rotterdamsche Dames Zwemclub (\\"Rotterdam's Ladies Swimming Club\\") champion in her favorite discipline, 100m freestyle and broke the Dutch national record on that distance by 1.4 seconds with a time of 1:10.4. A year later, Den Ouden came in the international limelight when she participated at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and won two of the five contestable silver medals in swimming. In the series, she also broke the Olympic record on the 100 m. These accomplishments attracted wide attention since as a 14-year old she was also the youngest Olympic participant. Four years later at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, she was widely favored to win the same race, but came in fourth place in the final. She did win the gold medal in the women's 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay with her compatriots Tini Wagner, Rie Mastenbroek and Jopie Selbach.Willy den Ouden. sports-reference.com However, the diminutive Den Ouden -she reached \\\\- was far more successful between these two Olympic games. At the 1934 European Championships in Magdeburg she won all three contests she participated in, though her shared win at the 400 m race with Rie Mastenbroek led only to a silver medal when she refused to swim the race again to decide a winner. On July 9, 1933 in Antwerp, she broke Helene Madison's two-year-old world record on the 100 m freestyle, setting it at 1:06.0. She would improve on this three times, swimming 1:04.8 in April 1934 and finally reaching 1:04.6 on 27 February 1936 in Amsterdam. This record would last until 1956 when it was broken twice within ten days by Dawn Fraser and Cocky Gastelaars, respectively. Thus, she held the world record for the top event in swimming for an unequalled 22 years and 8 months. Den Ouden further broke the world records on the 200 m freestyle (three times between 1933 and 1936), the 400 m freestyle (in 1934), and the now defunct distances of 100 yd, 150 yd, 220 yd, 300 yd, 400 yd, 300 m, and 500 m freestyle. She was also the anchor swimmer for the Dutch relay teams that broke the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay record in 1934 and in 1936. On February 4, 1934, she became the first woman to swim 100 yards in under a minute (59.8 seconds). In 1935 she held all 10 world-records freestyle swimming for 500 m and shorter simultaneously. She retired from competitive swimming in 1938, at the age of 20, after obtaining a silver medal at the European Championship's 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay. She set her eyes on an acting career and in 1939 she was cast in the Belgian movie Van het een komt het ander (\\"One Thing Leads to Another\\"). However the outbreak of the Second World War stopped the production. The German invasion of the Netherlands piled on the misery: Den Ouden was engaged, but her fianc√©'s family fled to America just before the invasion, and her parental house was destroyed on May 14, 1940 in the bombing of Rotterdam. Most if not all of her medals and prizes were lost in the burning rubble. Den Ouden herself fled to England, where in October 1943 she married Staffan Broms, son of a Swedish diplomat stationed in London. The couple moved to Saltsj√∂baden in Sweden after the wedding, but the marriage didn't last and in 1946 Den Ouden returned to Rotterdam. She married twice more; in November 1953 to Wicher Hooite Jager (divorce in 1957) and in October 1958 to Jan Edwin Schupper. Her last marriage only lasted half a year. Den Ouden spent her further life in anonymity although she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1970.

Israel Presses for Oil From Shale, by Neal Sandler, Business Week. 5 July 2006Analysis: Israel sees shale replacing oil, by Leah Krauss, UPI. 7 November 2006 In 1996, Sonol, a wholly owned subsidiary of Granite Hacarmel, invested $1.5 million in the company. In 2006, it was reported that 70% of the company shares would be acquired by a group of investors led by Israeli businessman Ofer Glazer. However, the transaction was not finalized, and Hom Tov subsequently ceased to operate. Shale oil extraction process In the shale oil extraction process (US Patent 5372708) invented in 1992 by Moshe Gvirtz (also spelled as Moshe Gewertz) and promoted by Hom Tov, oil shale fine particles are slurried with waste bitumen and pumped through coils in a heater. Promoters of this process claimed that the process was profitable at the crude oil price of US$17 per barrel. The company also claimed that the technology was more efficient as it enables the oil shale to be processed at somewhat lower temperatures with the addition of the catalyzing bitumen, and more environmentally friendly than classical shale oil extraction methods. In 2006, in conjunction with announcing the planned partnership with Glazer, the company announced plans to build a full-scale production plant in the Negev Desert south of Beer Sheba at Mishor Rotem.Israel assesses new oil shale technology, Platts Energy Economist, Issue 297 July 2006 The Mishor Rotem plant would bring bitumen by pipeline from the Ashdod refinery and return product along the same corridor.

Coggan is an engineer and consultant in the field of value engineering. As a published author he has made notable contributions to his field and become a recognized expert in value engineering.  Biography  Donald Coggan graduated from McGill University in 1967 with a degree in Electrical Engineering.Donald Coggan Curriculum Vitae. Retrieved 24 April 2009. From 1967 to 1977 he worked at Johnson Controls Limited, starting as a Sales Engineer, Canadian Sales Manager to account Manager building automation. From 1977 to 1980 he was manager at MCC Powers, unit of Mark Controls Ltd. In 1981 he founded Coggan Consulting Corporation for engineering consulting and software development. After 1988 as a consultant Coggan focussed on business management and engineering consulting. During his time at McGill he was awarded the J. W. McConnell Scholarship in Engineering. He is currently a member of the Ordre des Ing√©nieurs du Qu√©bec; Professional Engineers Ontario; Instrument Society of America; and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers.  Work  Coggan‚Äôs contributions to the field of value engineering fall primarily within three areas: automatic process control systems, laboratory ventilation control systems, and intelligent building.  Automatic Process Control Systems  Donald Coggan has become an innovator in his field by applying the practices of value engineering to both automatic process control systems and laboratory control systems. His contributions to laboratory control systems have enabled designers to reduce energy usage of a business while maintaining worker safety.  Intelligent Buildings  Although the definition of an intelligent building varies, it can essentially be understood to mean a building that utilizes a variety of advanced technologies to control and regulate the building. This may include, but is not limited to, the incorporation of computer-controlled energy management systems, advanced security systems, shared telecommunication services, local area networks, satellite facilities, and conferencing facilities into the structure of the building. Coggan‚Äôs contributions to intelligent buildings include the development of the Intelligent Building Database in 1985. This database identified the services that an intelligent building could offer, as well as the technology that would be required to implement such services. The database also analyzed which national and international markets were best suited for these services.  Publications  Cogggan wrote several books and articles.

The station transmits with 1,000 watts during the day using a directional antenna that sends the signal primarily to the north and south (including Lansing, Michigan). At night it operates with a 3 watts. In the summer of 2010, WWSJ began to simulcast on translator W262BD 100.3 FM licensed to Dimondale, Michigan, enabling it to get clearer FM coverage of the Lansing area day and night. W262BD operates with 22 watts from a transmitter in the heart of Lansing; despite being licensed to Dimondale, its primary signal contour does not actually reach Dimondale. W262BD is owned by Educational Media Foundation and had previously operated using EMF's Air 1 format; although EMF continues to own the translator, it is being programmed by the owners of WWSJ. History=Early history The station began operation at 10 a.m. on September 23, 1959, as WJUD. The original owner was Justin F. Marzke. In the 1960s, it was purchased by Robert D. Ditmer and began operating under the new callsign of WRBJ. In 1972 Ditmer added WRBJ-FM on 92.1 MHz (now WQTX). During the time the station was owned by Robert Ditmer it was a true community station playing a variety of music along with local high school sports, news and announcements. The 1980s bring changes Robert Ditmer sold WRBJ-AM-FM to R. Charles McLravy in 1981. McLravy changed the call letters of WRBJ-AM-FM to WQTK-AM-FM, and implemented a country music format which was simulcast on both stations. AM 1580 changed calls again in November 1982, this time to WKZY, when the station switched to an MOR format as \\"Cozy 16\\". The format did not last long, and by May 1983, the station had reverted to the country music format, and also back to the WQTK calls. The station implemented Al Ham's Music of Your Life format in October 1983, this time adopting the call letters WVGO, which had recently been dropped by Lansing station WVIC. By the spring of 1985, the call station's call letters changed again, this time to WKLH, simulcasting the country music format of FM sister station WKLH-FM (K-92). In early 1985, McLravy moved the WKLH-FM studios to the DeWitt Shopping Center, although the AM studio and transmitter remained on Parks Road, just south of St. Johns. McLravy sold WKLH-AM-FM, to Lansing Broadcasting Associates in July 1985, and on Labor Day 1985, the format of FM 92.1 was flipped to Album Oriented Rock. The call letters WGZS were applied for and assigned to AM 1580, in anticipation of a Christian format, but the format never materialized. Instead, WGZS became a simulcast of AOR sister station WLNZ-FM 92.1. The WGZS call letters, although assigned to the station for a short time, were never used on the air. Lansing Broadcasting Associates continued to maintain the AM studios on Parks Road, mainly because of an FCC requirement that both the AM and FM stations originate 50% of their news and public affairs programming from the St. Johns studio. Part-time employees were paid to operate the St. Johns studio and transmitter. In 1986, Robert Ditmer repurchased the AM station, now known as WLNZ, and changed the call sign to WWSJ. The station featured country music, talk, local news and high school sports. During a portion of this time it went by News Radio 1580 and featured syndicated talkers Phil Donahue, Church Harder and Jack Ellery. By the mid-1990s, the station added time-brokered Tejano music programming to a portion of its broadcast day. Into the '90s In February 1995, Ditmer sold the station to Steve and Cheryl Evans of DeWitt, Michigan, who operated the station under the company name Mint City Radio. WWSJ continued with a mix of country music, community information, Tejano music (time-brokered) and talk programs from the USA Radio Network. The station dropped the country music portion of its format in favor of Oldies on Labor Day 1995, and was rebranded as AM-16 The Mint. The Evans' sold the station back to Ditmer in August 1996. Shortly thereafter, Ditmer resold the station to Larry Harp, Helen Harp, Wayne Hill and Elmira Hill, and it became Joy 1580 playing urban Christian music. The station still uses the original studios at the transmitter on Parks Road, just south of St. Johns. Clinton County Radio Clinton County Radio was an internet radio station serving Clinton County, Michigan from June 2004 until September 2007. The station programmed an Oldies format which was based upon the format previously programmed by WWSJ and was created by former station co-owner Steve Evans, who co-operated the station along with former WWSJ program director Dan Drolett. The mission of the station was to provide residents of Clinton County with programming and services which were no longer being offered by terrestrial radio stations. The station's URL was http://www.clintoncountyradio.net. Clinton County Radio offered, in addition to Oldies from the 1960s and 70's, local weather, daily programs from the U.S.D.A., hourly news from the FSN Radio Network (and later the USA Radio Network), nostalgic radio programs under the title Radio's Golden Days, and a locally produced program entitled The Michigan Oldies Podcast. Through the use of digital automation, the station was able to operate with little if any overhead expense. Initially, the majority of announcing on the station was handled by Evans and Drolett, but Mark Walton and Bryan Mix-Dean were added as staff announcers in 2006. Both provided their services on a volunteer basis. Unlike its terrestrial predecessor WWSJ, Clinton County Radio was a non-profit operation. Dan Drolett announced the sale of the internet station and its assets to Tony Clark of Rosebush, Michigan in early September 2007. The internet stream ceased operations as Clinton County Radio at midnight on September 30, 2007.

Although slight gains were made in performance, the U.S. Army Air Corps and U.S. Navy did not order the aircraft. Design and development The Boeing YP-29 originated as the Model 264, developed as a private venture under a bailment contract negotiated with the U.S. Army. Development of three prototypes was initiated in the interval between the testing of the XP-936 (P-26 prototype, company Model 248) and the delivery of the first P-26A (Model 266) to the U.S. Army. The Model 264 was an updated and modernized P-26, differing in having fully cantilever wings of elliptical-design, wing flaps, enclosed \\"greenhouse\\" canopy, and retractable undercarriage. The landing gear was similar to the Boeing Monomail, the main wheels retracting backwards about halfway into the wings. The fuselage and the tail were basically the same as those of the P-26. The 264 retained the proven 550 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1340-31 Wasp air-cooled radial, used in the P-26. The armament of one 0.30-cal and one 0.50 cal machine guns mounted in the fuselage sides and firing between the cylinder heads of the radial engine was the same as the P-26A. The first Model 264 featured a long, narrow, sliding canopy, essentially a transparent continuation of the P-26's protective headrest, extending all the way to the windshield frame. The Wasp radial was enclosed in a full NACA cowling rather than the narrow Townend ring of the P-26. One final variant was considered by Boeing, the Model 273, which was intended for the U.S. Navy as the XF7B-1. Aside from slight dimensional variations, military equipment carried, and the performance ratings of its Wasp engine, the naval fighter was very similar to its Army antecedents. Like the other variants, its enclosed cockpit was eventually modified into an open cockpit, which was considered more acceptable in the era. Testing Boeing YP-29A The airplane made its maiden flight on 20 January 1934 and was flown to Wright Field for Army testing under the experimental military designation XP-940 five days later. During testing, the XP-940 achieved a maximum speed of 220 mph at 10,000 ft (354 km/h at 3,050 m). After testing, the XP-940 was returned to the factory in March for modifications. Due to the tight-fitting canopy and restricted pilot vision from the cockpit enclosure, Boeing reverted to an open cockpit design, retaining the long headrest all the way to the tail. The engine was replaced by a 600 hp (450 kW) R-1340-35 with a drag ring, similar to the P-26A's. It was also fitted with flaps, which the XP-940 lacked.Jones 1975, p. 71. Upon completion of testing of the XP-940, the Army decided on 29 June 1934 to purchase it and two sister ships. The designation P-29 was assigned. After the modified XP-940 was returned to the Army in April 1934, it was assigned the designation YP-29A (serial number 34-24). It eventually was redesignated the P-29A after an engine change to an R-1340-27 in place of the -35. The cleaner design of the P-29A resulted in a speed increase of 16 mph over the P-26A, but its greater weight cut down on the aircraft's ceiling and maneuverability. Consequently, the Army cancelled an intended P-29A order. The three prototypes were subsequently used strictly for experimental purposes. The second prototype was completed with a large and roomy glasshouse enclosure around the cockpit and, in addition, the tailwheel was housed in a different fairing. Other changes included an R-1340-35 enclosed in an anti-drag ring. The aircraft was delivered to the Army on 4 September 1934 under the designation YP-29 with serial number 34-23. Despite its earlier Army designation and serial number, it was actually the second Model 264 to fly. During tests, the following data was obtained: Weights were 2509 lbs. empty, 3518 lbs. gross. Maximum speed was 244 mph at 10,000 ft. Initial climb was 1,600 ft per minute. Service ceiling was 26,000 ft, and absolute ceiling was 26,700 ft. Range was 800 miles. This new cockpit enclosure satisfied the requirement for pilot protection at 250 mph operating speeds. Nevertheless, the landing speed of the YP-29 was considered too high for Army operational use and the YP-29 was returned to the factory for the installation of wing flaps. Following service testing by the Army and Boeing, which included trials with controllable pitch propellers, the service test designation was dropped and changed to P-29 after the engine was changed to a Pratt & Whitney R-1340-39. The third Model 264 was completed as the YP-29B with an open cockpit configuration similar to that of the YP-29A. The serial number was 34-25. The only outward differences between it and the YP-29A were the addition of a one-piece wing flap similar to that of the YP-29, an additional one degree of dihedral in the wing, and an oleo tail wheel assembly similar to that of the YP-29. The YP-29B was sent to Chanute Field in Illinois for service testing. It was eventually redesignated P-29B, adding to the bewildering succession of designations for essentially the same model. An additional variant with a 700 hp (520 kW) R-1535 (civil Twin Wasp Junior) was proposed, as the XP-32, but was never constructed. Flying for the first time in September 1933, the XF7B-1 (BuNo 9378) was the first monoplane fighter to be tested by the U.S. Navy, although concerns over its high landing speed rendered it unsuitable for carrier operations. All the P-29 and XF7B-1 aircraft were ultimately scrapped. Specifications (XF7B-1) XF7B-1 prior to modifications to an open cockpit c. 1933 See alsoReferences=NotesBibliography * Boeing Company.

It was introduced in 1947 and discontinued in 1979.Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years. After Fender introduced the Champ Amp in 1948, the Princeton occupied the next to the bottom spot in the Fender line. Fender Princetons (as well as their sister amp the Princeton Reverb) from the early models into the 1970s models are highly valued particularly as recording amplifiers. The first Princeton, the \\"Woody\\" (so called for its uncovered wooden cabinet), was the smallest of the original Fender line of three amplifiers, an incredibly basic 3-watt practice amp with no controls at all, not even a power switch.Technically this first \\"Princeton\\" had no name; it was offered in the catalog in a package with the Princeton lap steel guitar. The first widely produced Princeton, the 1948 tweed-covered \\"TV front,\\" used one 6SL7 or 6SC7 dual-triode tube to provide two stages of RC- coupled voltage amplification in the preamplifier section; the power amplifier section used a single cathode-biased 6V6 beam power tetrode necessarily in Class A operation. The amplifier had a single volume control and a simple low- pass tone control to control treble response. The Princeton circuits up through 5C2 differed from the Fender Champ in having two versus one preamp stage (6SC7 dual-triode vs 6SJ7 pentode) and added the tone control that was absent in the Champs; the 12AX7-based Princeton models 5D2 through 5F2-A were essentially the Champ circuits 5D1 through 5F1 with a tone control and a somewhat larger output transformer. In 1956 the Princeton received a new cabinet roughly half again as tall and wide as the previous Champ-sized \\"small box.\\" In 1961, a new Princeton (6G2) of fundamentally different design was introduced, which instead of being essentially an upgraded Champ was more like a junior Deluxe.In fact, the circuit was nearly identical to the 1955-61 Vibrolux This \\"brownface\\" version used a single 7025 dual triode in the preamplifier; a 12AX7 dual triode, one half of which operated a tremolo oscillator and the other half of which served as a split-load phase inverter; and two 6V6GT tubes, which were fixed-biased in Class AB push-pull configuration in the power section. In 1963, the single tone control was replaced with individual bass and treble control knobs, and the base Princeton was joined by the Princeton Reverb. A pull-out \\"boost\\" switch was added to the volume pot in 1978. The Princeton is particularly famous as the basis for Mesa Boogie's Mark I, which is a heavily hotrodded Princeton equipped with modified preamp and a Bassman transformer, allowing it a higher gain output of 60 watts. Fender produced a solid state Princeton, the Princeton Chorus, from 1988-1991 (\\"red knob,\\" made in USA) and 1991-1997 (\\"black knob,\\" made in Mexico). This model was notable for its two independent 25.5-watt amplifiers running in stereo mode. In 2006, Fender revived the Princeton name, under \\"Princeton Recording-Amp\\" (Pro-tube series) and \\"Princeton 650\\" (under Dyna- touch III series). The Princeton recording amplifier is basically a blackface Princeton with built-in overdrive, compressor and power attenuator. Fender also reissued the Princeton Reverb in 2008.

It was released in 1939. Background Director Jyotiprasad faced a major financial crisis after his first film Joymoti (1935) failed commercially. He spent more than Rs 50,000 and was in debt in the late 1930s; he was fortunate to gather together just Rs 15,000 to make his dream of making a second film come true. Desperately seeking to compensate the loss he incurred in the making of Joymoti, he began shooting Indramalati in late 1937. This time, however, he did not use his Chitraban Studio for the outdoor shoot. Instead, he chose the ‚ÄòTalbari‚Äô of his family, at Harigaon, two kilometres from Tezpur Mission Chariali. Within seven days, Jyotiprasad completed the outdoor shooting for the picture and often the camera was kept at a fixed point as the sets and artistes kept changing the angles. The film used over 15,000 feet of reel. On release in 1939 it was relatively successful, earning in excess of Joymati, aiding Jyotiprasad to go on to direct other films afterwards. Story Jyotiprasad Agarwala wrote the story of Indramalati, which was a tale of romance. The name of the hero was Indrajit while Malati was the name of the heroine. Significantly, Jyotiprasad was the first filmmaker to introduce the style of movie-making of using the names of the lead pair. The role of the hero was played by Manoviram Baruah while Raseswari Baruah (Hazarika) was cast as Malati. Acclaimed theatre actor Phani Sarma was again drafted in to play one of the significant roles, that of Indrajit‚Äôs friend. Even great Assamese musician Dr Bhupen Hazarika acted in the film and sang \\"Biswa Bijoyee Navajowan\\" at only age 13. Unlike casting for his first film, Jyotiprasad faced comparatively less trouble in finding actors for Indramalati. There were only nine major roles in Indramalati. Besides Manoviram Barua and Raseswari Baruah, the others were Phani Sarma, Thanuram Bora, Lalit Mohan Choudhury, Khargeswar Agarwalla, Kashi Saikia, Bedananda Sarma and Bhupen Hazarika. Other actors who were in the film included the Rupkonwar himself, Jnanaviram Barua, Mani Lahiri, etc. Filming and production After the casting and seven-day outdoor shoot, the eight-member film unit left for Kolkata where they would shoot for the indoor locations. Sets were built in Arora Studio, Narkeldanga, where all the indoor shooting was done. An amazingly short three-day shooting schedule at Arora Studio was followed by the artistes, working hard round the clock. Indramalati was produced once again under the banner of ‚ÄòChitralekha Movietone and was very much a solo effort in that Jyotiprasad Agarwalla was the director, screenwriter, lyricist, music director, art director, costume designer and editor. No artistes of Indramalati, like Joymoti, took remuneration. They even participated in the shooting wearing their own clothes. In some scenes, the costumes fail to maintain continuity.

He was later freed and resided in Portugal before being impressed into the Royal Navy. He was eventually discharged near Cornwall and later became a notable and celebrated violinist and composer in the region, passing away in 1835. Life Born in Guinea, Emidy was sold into slavery as a child to Portuguese traders who took him to Brazil and later to Portugal. In Portugal, he became a virtuoso violinist in the Lisbon Opera. He was press-ganged by sailors under Admiral Sir Edward Pellew during the Napoleonic Wars and spent the next four years serving as a ship's fiddler. Music Early 19th-century sketch of the Truro Philharmonic Orchestra with Joseph Antonio Emidy In 1799, Emidy was discharged in Falmouth, Cornwall. In Falmouth, he earned his living as a violinist and a teacher. He became the leader of the Truro Philharmonic Orchestra, and went on to become one of the most celebrated and influential musical figures in early 19th-century Cornwall. He composed many works, including concertos and a symphony, but no known copies survive.Cornwall, musicians, history (British Association for Local History). Personal life In 1802, he married Jane Hutchins, a local tradesman's daughter, and they had eight children. They moved to Truro around 1815. Death listed He died in Truro, Cornwall, and his grave is in Kenwyn churchyard.

Members of the TDA were known by many names such as Lithuanian auxiliaries, policemen, white-armbands, nationalists, rebels, partisans, or resistance fighters. TDA was intended as basis for the future independent Lithuanian Army, but soon it was taken over by Nazi officials and reorganized into the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions (Lithuanian version of Schutzmannschaft). The original TDA eventually became the 12th and the 13th Police Battalions. These two units took an active role in mass killings of the Jews in Lithuania and Belarus. Based on the J√§ger Report, members of TDA murdered about 26,000 Jews between July and December 1941. Formation As Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union and invaded Lithuania, the Provisional Government of Lithuania declared independence on June 23, 1941. Lithuanians hoped to restore independent Lithuania that existed before the Soviet occupation or at least gain some autonomy from Nazi Germany. In an effort to re-establish Lithuanian Army, the Provisional Government announced the formation of the TDA in Kaunas on June 28. Plans for such a formation were made as early as March 24, 1941. TDA wore a white armband with black letters TDA on their sleeves. Andrius Butk≈´nas became the first commander of the newly formed battalion. The original goals of the formation were to protect strategic objects (like bridges or railways), guard Soviet prisoners of war, establish general order in Kaunas and in the vicinity. By July 4, 724 men, mostly former Lithuanian soldiers and partisans fighting in the June Uprising against the retreating Soviets, responded to the announcement and signed up for the battalion. By the end of July, seven companies were formed. At the time of its formation TDA was the only armed and organized group in Kaunas and Nazi authorities took advantage of it. Activities=Executions of Jews According to a July 6 report by Karl J√§ger, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, two companies of TDA were assigned to duties related to mass murders of Jews: one was to guard and execute Jews at the Seventh Fort of the Kaunas Fortress and another was assigned to Einsatzkommando. According to extensive post-war investigations by Soviet authorities, as executions of Jews grew in number more companies of TDA were involved in the murders. In light of such developments TDA started losing its members: between July 5 and July 11, 117 members resigned. Commander of the 1st company, which was especially frequently involved in the executions, committed suicide on July 12. The 3rd company was assigned to the notorious Rollkommando Hamann commanded by Joachim Hamann and Bronius Norkus. The unit committed mass murders of Jews in the countryside. Based on the J√§ger Report, members of TDA murdered about 26,000 Jews between July and December 1941. Reorganizations During the night between July 23 and 24, some members of the TDA were involved in an attempted coup against the Provisional Government. The coup, organized by members of the Iron Wolf Association and supported by German Gestapo, succeeded in replacing the leadership of the TDA. Iron Wolf now could promote or dismiss various members of TDA. Commander Butk≈´nas was replaced by Kazys ≈†imkus. The Provisional Government dissolved itself on August 5, 1941. The following day Franz Lechthaler took over the command of all police units, including TDA. On August 7, when TDA had 703 members, Lechthaler ordered the battalion to be reorganized into two battalions of auxiliary police or Hilfspolizei ( or PPT) and renamed accordingly. During August three more battalions of PPT were formed. In October these five battalions were renamed to security battalions (). Liquidation and persecution Eight members of TDA on trial in 1961 (found guilty and executed) In December, the five battalions were reorganized again: * 1st battalion became the 13th, * 2nd ‚Äì 12th, * 3rd ‚Äì 11th battalions of Lithuanian Self-Defence Units (). In 1942 the new 13th battalion was reassigned to combat Soviet partisans near Pskov and Tver. The 13th battalion started retreating with losing Wehrmacht in 1944. Its members were captured by Red Army or hid in Lithuanian forests. Many members were persecuted by Soviet authorities for their anti-Soviet activities. Some were executed, others imprisoned in Gulags. Soviet investigations continued until 1979 when the last execution was carried out in Minsk.

The DOW fleet and its associated Mobile Mesonet and Pod deployable weather stations are Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities (LAOF) \\"National Facilities\\" supporting a wide variety NSF- sponsored research.  History and deployment  As of 2017, there are three operational DOWs of a total of eight constructed since 1995. All three are dual-polarization dual-frequency quick-scanning Doppler weather radars. Several instrumented mobile mesonet pickup trucks host in situ weather instrumentation on masts to complement the remote sensing radars. These mobile mesonets also carry approximately twenty instrumented \\"PODS\\", which are ruggedized quickly deployable weather stations designed to survive inside tornadoes, tropical cyclones, and other adverse environments. The DOW fleet is sometimes accompanied by a Mobile Operations and Repair Center (MORC), a large van containing workstations for in-field coordination, data management, and equipment repair. The DOW fleet has collected data in 200 tornadoes and inside the cores of thirteen hurricanes. DOWs have been deployed to Europe twice, for the MAP and COPS field programs, and to Alaska twice for the JAWS-Juneau projects. DOWs have operated as high as on Bristol Head and at for the ASCII project at Battle Pass. Three DOWs, Mobile Mesonets and PODS were deployed for the OWLeS lake-effect snow study. The DOWs have participated in many field programs including VORTEX, VORTEX2, COPS, MAP, ASCII, IHOP, SCMS, CASES, ROTATE, PAMREX, SNOWD-UNDER, FLATLAND, HERO, UIDOW, UNDEO. The DOW fleet was deployed to the nocturnal convection study, PECAN, in June‚ÄìJuly 2015.  Findings  DOW data led to the discovery of sub-kilometer hurricane boundary layer rolls, which likely modulate wind damage and may play a key role in hurricane intensification. DOW data revealed the most intense winds ever recorded (Bridge Creek tornado, 3 May 1999), and the largest tornadic circulation ever documented (also 3 May 1999 in Mulhall, OK), and made the first 3D maps of tornado winds and sub-tornadic vortex winds, and documented intense vortices within lake-effect snow bands. About 70 peer reviewed scientific publications have used DOW data. The DOW fleet, PODS, and mobile mesonets have been featured on television, including Discovery Channel's reality series Storm Chasers, National Geographic Channel's specials Tornado Intercept and The True Face of Hurricanes, and PBS's Nova episode \\"The Hunt for the Supertwister,\\" and others.

La Lomia served as part of a papal-commissioned mission to Brazil where he dedicated himself to works of evangelization and the preservation of culture. He was a noted preacher and served as a confessor to Emperor Pedro II. La Lomia's cause for canonization commenced and he was titled as a Servant of God when it commenced. In 2002 he was named as Venerable upon confirmation of his life of heroic virtue. Life Gaetano La Lomia was born on 3 March 1831 in Canicatt√¨ as the seventh of nine children to the baron Nicol√≤ La Lomia and Eleonora Agostino ( 1799-15.3.1879); the couple married on 11 October 1818. One brother was Francesco Salvatore. His maternal grandparents were Ferdinando Agostino and Rosalia Li Chiavi and his maternal great-grandfather was Marco Agostino. His nephew was the writer Agostino Fausto La Lomia (30.1.1905-21.1.1978). He received baptism from Biagio Salamone and his godparents were Emanuele and Carolina La Lomia. He decided to become a Franciscan after he heard the Capuchin priest Michele da San Cataldo preach. La Lomia entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin on 4 November 1851 where he assumed the religious name of \\"Gioacchino Fedele da Canicatt√¨\\" and was vested on 12 December 1852 before he was ordained to the priesthood in Palermo on 2 June 1855; he had received the tonsure and minor orders the previous 2 March. La Lomia made his solemn profession in Agrigento on 5 November 1853 and since 1861 underwent his theological and philosophical studies at Caltanissetta. On 27 June 1864 he left for Rome to learn Portuguese. He served in the missions in the Amazonian Forest in Brazil from March 1868 until 1880 at the behest of Pope Pius IX who commissioned the Franciscan-led mission. He departed from Sardinia on 13 January 1868 and arrived first in Rio de Janeiro in March. Together with other brothers in the mission he preached the Gospel to thirteen villages and dedicated himself to the improvement of the health and the wellbeing of the Brazilian people as well as to the improvement of culture in the region; he also baptized converts to the faith. Ill health forced him to stop his work and return to his homeland and he left on 14 January 1880 to arrive in Rome on 1 April. It was upon his return that his nephew Nicol√≤ La Lomia informed him that his mother had died on 15 March 1879. He returned to his homeland in 1880 and established the convent for the order at Canicatt√¨ in the Madonna della Rocca church. He was famous for performing miracles both in Brazil and in his homeland and he was a noted preacher and evangelist. His charismatic and humble nature was recognized and even Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil acknowledged him and had La Lomia hear his confessions. La Lomia preached his final mission starting on 6 April 1903 and knew around Easter that his life was coming to a close. On 28 July 1905 he was bought to his cell window to impart his blessing to the faithful who kept their vigil outside. La Lomia died in his convent at 8:00pm on 30 July 1905. Doctor Sciacca embalmed him on 31 July and his funeral was celebrated on 1 August lasting over three hours; his remains were relocated on 21 April 1912. Beatification process The beatification process for La Lomia began in the Agrigento archdiocese that saw the late friar titled as a Servant of God; the Archbishop Giovanni Battista Peruzzo oversaw the informative phase of investigation from 1949 until its closure in 1951. The documents and other collected information from the archdiocese was sent to the Congregation for Rites but the cause remained dormant for some time until the Congregation for the Causes of Saints began assessing the documents and validated the informative process on 26 April 1985. The postulation later compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for further investigation. The theologians approved the dossier's contents in their meeting on 12 February 2002 as did the C.C.S. themselves on 9 April 2002. On 23 April 2002 - in the Clementine Hall - Pope John Paul II proclaimed him to be Venerable after confirming that the late friar had lived a model life of heroic virtue. One miracle is required to receive papal ratification before La Lomia can be beatified. One such case was investigated and was sent to the C.C.S. for additional investigation; the C.C.S. validated the process on 19 December 1997 but initial investigation debunked the healing as no miracle attributed to La Lomia prompting the search for another possible miracle. There was a second later reported in France and was investigated with that process ending sometime in 2016; the documents were sent to the C.C.S. in March 2017 for further evaluation. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan priest Carlo Calloni. Music In the 1970s there was the first recording of \\"The Padre Gioacchino Song\\" in the Sicilian region on 45rpm that Cesare d'Ambra undertook; the orchestration was performed under the direction of Maestro Giuseppe Buttice. It remains a noted piece of music still recited. Chista e' la storia di Patri Jachinu, lu bon cappuccinu, di Canijatti'. Lassa' lu munnu, si chiusi 'ncummentu e tuttu cuntentu a Diu, sirvi... This is the story of Padre Gioacchino, the good Cappuccino, of Canicatti'. He left the world to be secluded in a convent totally contented to serve the Lord...

The party contested elections to both the London County Council and metropolitan borough councils of the county from 1906 to 1945. Formation The party was formed in 1906 in order to overturn Progressive and Labour control of much of London municipal government. Before 1906 the Conservatives stood as Moderates. A central Municipal Reform Committee was formed in September 1906, and the new organisation absorbed the Moderate Party, who formed the opposition to the Progressives on the county council, as well as groups on the borough councils that opposed what they termed the \\"Progressive-Socialist Party\\".London Borough Council elections, The Times, 26 September 1906 The new party was actively supported by the London Municipal Society whose aim was \\"maintaining and promoting the effective and economical working of the existing system of London Government.\\" The Society campaigned on behalf of Municipal Reform candidates, who it was hoped would reduce municipal debt and \\"overcome the increasing advance of Socialism under Progressive auspices\\".London Municipal Reform, advertisement for the London Municipal Society, The Times, 30 October 1906 Metropolitan borough councils The first elections for which the Municipal Reform Party stood were those to Metropolitan Borough councils, on 1 November 1906. The campaign was very successful, with Municipal Reformers winning control of twenty-two of twenty-eight councils. Of the remaining six councils, three had majorities of Municipal Reform-backed ratepayers or independents. Progressives held only three of twelve boroughs they previously controlled, while the Labour party lost its only borough, Woolwich, to the new party.London borough council elections, The Times, 3 November 1906 1906 was to prove a high point for Municipal Reform in the boroughs. They lost some ground in 1909 and 1912, but in 1919 they suffered major reverses at the hands of a resurgent Labour Party. Labour and Municipal Reform each had control of 11 boroughs after the election, although Municipal Reformers were able to have a share of power in the remaining boroughs by forming anti-Labour alliances with the remnants of the Progressive organisation. This anti-Labour strategy led to them returning to power in a number of boroughs at the next election in 1922 and by 1931 they controlled 18 boroughs, with six others controlled by allied parties or coalitions. From that point on the party's vote and share of seats declined at each election. The last election contested by the Municipal Reform Party was in 1945, when they held six boroughs. At the following election in 1949, official Conservative Party candidates stood for the first time. More councils won by Conservatives ‚Äì Heavy Labour losses in London, The Times, 14 May 1949 London County Council Following their success in the 1906 borough elections, the Municipal Reform Party published a manifesto for the 1907 London County Council election. The party's policies included: tight controls on financial expenditure, proper auditing of municipal accounts, creation of a traffic board to co-ordinate transport in the capital, abandonment of the Progressive Party's plan to supply electricity in favour of provision by private enterprise and an education policy favouring denominational schools.The Coming L.C.C. Elections ‚Äì Municipal Reform Policy, The Times, 5 December 1906 The election was held on 2 March 1907, and the party's campaign was highly successful, with Municipal Reformers taking power from the Progressives.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.

The French surrounded the much smaller Dutch force, which however managed to beat it back, break out and retire to safety. The battle had no strategic effect whatsoever. Prelude After taking Bonn on May 15, Marlborough now wanted to conquer Ostend, Antwerp, or force the French to an open battle. He ordered the Dutch general, Coehoorn, to march to Ostend and lay siege to it. Dutch general Van Sparre would march south west of Antwerp, Dutch general Obdam would march south from Bergen op Zoom, and Marlborough himself would march on Lier. The Battle of Ekeren by Constantijn Francken Obdam had to send several of his battalions to join Coehoorn. Obdam's depleted force marched on 28 June from Bergen op Zoom to Antwerp. It arrived the next day at Ekeren, seven kilometres north of Antwerp, just south of Dutch held fort Lillo (top left of map). After hearing about this, Villeroi sent a detachment force-marching from Diest to support the troops already around Antwerp to pounce on Obdam's force, before it could dig in or be reinforced. The battle The Battle of Ekeren by Jasper Broers Early in the morning of 30 June French dragoons marched from Merksem and Ekeren in the direction of Kapellen to cut off the escape route near Hoevenen for the Dutch to return to Breda and Bergen-op-Zoom. The Marquis of Bedmar and his Spanish troops were positioned near Wilmarsdonk. This ensured that the Dutch forces were surrounded on all sides by a force outnumbering them four to one. Soon Dutch reconnaissance discovered the French dragoons and Obdam immediately sent his cavalry to Hoevenen, but it was too late, the village was packed with French troops. An attempt to conquer neighboring Muisbroek also failed. Then the French attacked, and Obdam tried to take Oorderen, an attack which was briefly successful before the French retook the village. The fighting went on for the entire day. The engagement was long and bloody. Dutch drill and independently and quick thinking lower commanders made up for their lack in numbers. Towards the end, many units were out of ammunition, and several Dutch units continued to fight with fixed bayonets only. By eight o'clock there was no more sign of Obdam, and Slangenburg decided to attack Oorderen to force a breakthrough to safety. Friesheim sent his men wading through the water, appearing where the French had not expected them to. Here too the fighting was long and hard, but the attack was a success: the encirclement was broken and the Dutch troops could retire under cover of the night to fort Lillo. Aftermath General Slangenburg The battle was undecided, but both sides claimed victory. The French because they ended up occupying the battlefield, the Dutch because they had forced the French from the battlefield, allowing the outnumbered Dutch to retire to safety. It may be considered an operational victory for the Two Crowns, because it stopped the Dutch move along the Scheldt. And it may be considered a tactical victory for the Dutch, because they managed to save 8,000 troops instead of losing 10,000. Boufflers was blamed for letting a perfect chance slip through his fingers. Obdam had panicked in the afternoon and had managed to get through the enemy line with a handful of riders by throwing away their green field signs and orange sashes so everyone around thought them to be French. His behaviour was not forgiven by the Dutch military, and his military career was destroyed. Slangenburg, for his part, was acclaimed as a Dutch hero. He was also furious at Marlborough, who had been outmanoeuvered by the French and had not come to the aid of the Dutch. The Dutch took one gun, 2 sets of dragoon drums and at least 17 banners (several other had been reused as scarfs before they could be collected). The French and Spaniards lost at least 2,800 men: over 1,200 killed, 1,200 wounded and several hundred missing. The Dutch lost over 2,400 men: around 700 killed, 1,000 wounded and 700 taken prisoner or missing. Exact Dutch losses: 2,423 combatants out of 10,629 (23%), of which 2,049 were infantry (553 killed, 862 wounded, 634 prisoner or missing, or 27% of the infantry) and 374 cavalry (162 killed, 152 wounded, 60 prisoner or missing, or 12% of the cavalry; and 376 horses: 279 killed, 58 wounded and 39 missing, or 13% of the horses). Losses from the train were 17 men, 22 wagons and 30 horses (7 men wounded, the others missing). Modern location A large part of the battlefield, including the villages of Oorderen, Wilmarsdonk and Lillo, has disappeared under the Port of Antwerp expansion in the 1960s.

The line, \\"Sticking to my pointy ribs/ Are all your infants in abortion cribs\\" refers to a story told in The Long Hard Road Out of Hell in which Manson as a child found a coffee can with something rotting inside. His mother told him it was discarded meat, but later told him that it was actually an aborted fetus. Manson initially penned the song during his cousin Chad's wedding ceremony. In his autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out of Hell Manson writes that the wedding was the first time he'd been in a church since his childhood. He recounts feeling uncomfortable during the service and imagining himself marrying a black woman or gay man. He says it was during this service that he conceived of the closing line for the Antichrist Superstar album: \\"The boy that you loved is the man that you fear.\\" On the album version, the final two minutes repeat the phrase \\"When all of your wishes are granted, many of your dreams will be destroyed.\\" The synthesized voices at the end of the song appear courtesy of the MacInTalk speech feature of Apple's Macintosh computers.

Early life Kilkenny's father and uncle immigrated to Morrow County, Oregon, from County Leitrim in Ireland in the 1890s. They worked for the railroads until they had saved enough money to buy land. John Kilkenny was born in Heppner, Oregon on October 26, 1901. He was raised on a sheep farm and attended the one-room Alpine School before being sent to Portland, Oregon, where he attended the private boys' boarding school Columbia Preparatory. After graduation, Kilkenny went on to the Notre Dame Law School, graduating in 1925 with cum laude honors earning a Bachelor of Laws. At Notre Dame, Kilkenny tried out for the football team, then coached by Knute Rockne, but a knee injury kept him from playing. He helped manage one of the teams and was assigned by Rockne the task of acquiring four horses for the Four Horsemen photograph in 1924 due to his experience growing up on a ranch. Legal career Upon graduation he became a practicing attorney in Pendleton Oregon, until his appointment to the federal bench in 1959. In 1931 he married Virginia Brannock in Pendleton and had two children. While in private practice he served as president of the Oregon State Bar from 1943 to 1944.

His service terminated on February 17, 1995, due to his death. Later life In 1984, the federal courthouse in Pendleton, Oregon was renamed in his honor and is now the John F. Kilkenny U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. While on the bench, Kilkenny worked to preserve Portland, Oregon's Pioneer Courthouse, receiving an award for this work in 1974 from the American Association for State and Local History. Kilkenny was a student of Irish American history, and wrote Shamrocks and Shepherds: The Irish of Morrow County (1981), about the history of Irish settlement in Eastern Oregon. In the same year, he received an award of merit from the Oregon State Bar. He donated funds to both Blue Mountain Community College and his alma mater, Notre Dame Law School. Kilkenny died in Beaverton, Oregon, at the age of 93 on February 17, 1995. He is buried at Olney Cemetery in Pendleton.

Football career After playing at the University of North Dakota, Myhra was drafted in the 12th round of the 1956 NFL Draft by the Colts as an offensive guard and linebacker. In 1957, Myhra became the Colts' placekicker, and was successful on 88% of his extra point attempts (14 of 16) and 4 of 6 on field goals. The next season, Myhra was only 4 for 10 on field goal attempts, which many have speculated may be why Johnny Unitas and the Colts went for the touchdown in overtime of the championship game rather than line up for a game- winning field goal attempt. Myhra is known for kicking the game-tying field goal for the Baltimore Colts with seven seconds to go in the fourth quarter of the 1958 NFL Championship Game. His field goal pushed the game into overtime, marking the first occasion in professional football history that any game had moved into an extra period. The game was eventually won by the Colts on a touchdown by Alan Ameche, and has since become referred to as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\". Myhra kicked for the Colts for three more seasons.

Though once believed to be cryptodires, they are not closely related to any living species of turtle, and lie outside crown group Testudines, having diverged from them around the Middle Jurassic. They are best known from the last surviving genus, Meiolania, which lived in the rain forests of Australia from the Miocene until the Pleistocene, and insular species that lived on Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia during the Pleistocene and possibly the Holocene for the latter. A similar form is also known from the Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna of New Zealand. The family was once thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the Miocene, when the earliest Meiolania first appeared. However, due to the discovery of South American meiolaniids, including Niolamia in Eocene Argentina, it is now believed that the meiolaniids appeared sometime prior to the breakup of South America, Australia and Antarctica during the Eocene. More recently, Eocene Australian species have also been uncovered.

Both are devices that provide a physical and aerodynamic (air overpressure) barrier between the external clean room environment and a work process. The isolator design is the more dependable of the two barrier design choices, as it prevents contamination hazards by achieving a more comprehensive separation of the processing environment from the surrounding facility. Nonetheless, both Isolator and RABS designs are contemporary approaches developed over the last 35 years and a great advancement over designs of the 1950s-70s that were far more prone to microbial contamination problems. Barrier and Isolator designs are used throughout the industries, from sterile injectable drug filling to cytotoxic sterile drug compounding to electronics manufacturing to orange juice filling. Pharmaceutical industry and pharmacy compounding isolators are used for maintaining sterility of a drug, and that is the focus of this article. This type of strict design and control is important when producing sterile medicines because consumers receiving injections, surgical irrigants, or other \\"parenterally\\"-administered drugs are often highly vulnerable to infection. As a result, contaminated drugs have caused grave (e.g., permanent injury, death) consequences for the consumer. The sterility of other dosage forms, such as ophthalmics, is similarly important, as blindness or partial loss of vision has occurred due to intrinsically contaminated eye medications. Isolators are routinely found within the pharmaceutical industry and are widely used in Europe (and increasingly in the US) for pharmacy aseptic compounding applications. See also Asepsis. They are designed to provide continuous and complete isolation of the inside of the isolator from the external room environment (including its operators). Only installed gloves or robotic arms are used to manipulate the product. This ensures that the environment is maintained as contamination-free to safeguard patients who will later be administered the drug. Isolators operate as positive-pressure devices, and use full wall separation and substantial overpressure to both physically and aerodynamically separate the interior from the external room environment. The more complete technical definition is as follows: An isolator is a decontaminated unit, supplied with Class 100 (ISO 5) or higher air quality, that provides uncompromised, continuous isolation of its interior from the external environment (e.g., surrounding cleanroom air and personnel). There are two major types of isolators: # Closed Isolator operation \\"Closed isolator\\" systems exclude external contamination from the isolator's interior by accomplishing material transfer via aseptic connection to auxiliary equipment, rather than use of openings to the surrounding environment. Closed systems remain sealed throughout operations. # Open Isolator \\"Open Isolator\\" systems are designed to allow for the continuous or semi- continuous ingress and/or egress of materials during operations through one or more openings. Openings are engineered (i.e., using continuous overpressure) to exclude external contamination from entering the isolator chamber. While the positive pressure isolator is most common, \\"negative\\" pressure devices also exist for very large industrial operations that handle toxic products. The \\"negative pressure isolator,\\" and has become less common and desirable, but is superior to the traditional biosafety cabinet which is vulnerable to contamination and can expose the worker to toxicological hazards if not operated properly. A simpler and more effective option for nearly all toxicological containment applications is the use of \\"closed isolator\\" design, which is maintained under positive pressure (this is the most appropriate containment option unless a company processes thousands of units per minute). If a negative isolator is used, its intricate design must fulfill two objectives: protect workers outside of the isolator, and assure sterility of sterile drugs inside the isolator. As such, the term \\"negative pressure\\" isolator is somewhat of a misnomer, as contaminated (\\"polluted\\") room air must not be pulled into the main workstation isolator in a sterile operation. Thus, the actual workstation isolator is always maintained under substantial positive pressure. The \\"negative\\" pressure isolator does however include a separate buffer zone (an extra isolator compartment) that is designed to exhaust both incoming room air and outgoing positive pressure air from the main workstation. The main workstation isolator, in which the sterile product is exposed, is therefore protected from contaminated air as the toxic product should be exhausted via the buffer zone before it reaches operators working outside of the isolation. In addition to Isolators, there are also extensive barriers that provide sub-isolation protection, but have a very good track record of reducing hazards to sterile drugs during processing when they are designed and operated properly. This extensive barrier is known as a restricted access barrier system, or RABS. A barrier cabinet using RABS design and control, is below the isolator in its ability to assure sterility assurance and containment, but far better than the traditional laminar air flow hood or \\"open process\\" designs that are progressively being phased-out by the industries. In particular, a RABS that operates only in closed-door mode after the equipment setup and sporadic disinfection is performed, is commonly used now and provides substantial risk mitigation. These \\"closed RABS\\" require all processing interventions to be done using gauntlet gloves attached to the RABS walls. RABS doors are only opened at the start of an operation to perform equipment setup, and must be locked thereafter until the conclusion of operations. In contrast, other RABS designs allow for rare door openings in specified circumstances. Because this \\"open RABS\\" allows for a door to be opened to the surrounding cleanroom (albeit into a fully HEPA-filtered perimeter around the RABS structure) during aseptic operations, the design allows for higher contamination hazard than a RABS that is kept closed. If doors are opened to the \\"open RABS\\" on anything other than an exceptional basis, it may not represents an improvement over traditional aseptic processes. Therefore, \\"open RABS\\" must be operated properly to realize sterility assurance gains. Some historical background regarding isolators and RABS is also important to understand how sterile product proaction has evolved. In the mid-1980s, after the industry had already begun to employ isolators, RABS units became an alternative to separating people from the process. While isolator usage continued to expand, RABS also became popular in the 1990s. The acronym RABS was coined by Stewart Davenport of Upjohn (now Pfizer). (See ISPE publications for a definition of RABS.) Since that time, the technology and applications of these systems has developed and broadened significantly. It is now very unusual for a sterile drug operation to be run without either an Isolator or RABS protective design. There are also other devices, which can offer some helpful separation. These devices are known as Gloveboxes. Gloveboxes do not offer the separative control provisions of an isolator or RABS. Gloveboxes were originally designed for non-sterile product applications, such as weighing or manipulating a toxic drug and have a long track record for such non-sterile applications. Such gloveboxes can be very effective in preventing exposure of an operator to a toxic drug. In limited cases, they can also be used to protect a sterile product, when supplied with ISO 5 unidirectional air. However, in some notable cases, gloveboxes used for aseptic processing have provided no more sterile product protection than the traditional laminar air flow hood (LAF) design of the 1960s. In these cases, the glove boxes were problematic due to inappropriate design or controls (e.g., insufficient disinfection, transfer of contaminated materials, ingress of lower quality air into glovebox, poor design/integrity, poor transfers). However, if gloveboxes are very meticulously designed, thoroughly disinfected (e.g., using a sporadical) and carefully operated by well-trained aseptic processing personnel to prevent introduction of microbial contamination, it is possible to obtain some degree of increased sterile product protection versus the simple traditional LAF hood.

The route runs through various townships and boroughs in Delaware and Chester, and Montgomery counties, including Nether Providence Township, Media, Upper Providence Township, Marple Township, Newtown Township, Easttown Township, Tredyffrin Township, and Upper Merion Township. The route intersects many roads including U.S. Route 1 (US 1) north of Media, PA 3 in Newtown Square, US 30 in Paoli, and US 202 in Tredyffrin Township. The southernmost part of PA 252 was originally built as part of the Providence Road in 1684. PA 252 was designated by 1928 to run from PA 320 north of Chester north to US 122/PA 52 (now US 202) in King of Prussia. By 1960, the northern terminus was moved to PA 23 in King of Prussia. PA 252 was realigned to head to its current northern terminus at Valley Forge by 1970, running along a concurrency with US 202 (removed by 1980) for a distance north of Paoli and replacing a part of PA 83 in the Valley Forge area. Route description  Providence Road (center of map) from 289x289px Delaware County PA 252 northbound in Wallingford PA 252 begins at an intersection with PA 320 north of the city of Chester in Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, heading north-northwest on two-lane undivided Providence Road. The road passes through wooded suburban residential neighborhoods, running to the west of Springhaven Country Club. The route heads into the community of Wallingford, where it passes to the east of Strath Haven High School and comes to a bridge over SEPTA's Media/Elwyn Line west of Wallingford station. PA 252 continues north and enters the borough of Media, where it heads into commercial areas and intersects Baltimore Avenue. A block further north, the route intersects State Street at the point SEPTA's Route 101 trolley line crosses the road at-grade west of the Providence Road station. The road continues through residential areas in the eastern part of Media. PA 252 leaves Media for Upper Providence Township and continues past homes with some businesses. The route widens to a four-lane divided highway as it comes to an interchange with the US 1 freeway bypass of Media. Past this interchange, PA 252 becomes a four-lane undivided road with two northbound and southbound lanes, passing to the west of Rose Tree Park. The route splits from Providence Road by curving north onto two-lane Palmers Mill Road, running through wooded residential areas. The road crosses Crum Creek on the dam that forms Springton Reservoir to the west, at which point it enters Marple Township. Past the reservoir, Palmers Mill Road turns to the east and PA 252 continues north on Newtown Street Road, running past more homes. The road passes to the west of Delaware County Community College before it heads into Newtown Township at the Media Line Road intersection. The route continues north through wooded suburban development. PA 252 turns northwest and heads through commercial areas as it comes to an intersection with PA 3 in the community of Newtown Square. Past this intersection, the road widens into a four-lane divided highway and passes more businesses before heading between a business campus to the west and residential areas to the east. The route curves north before heading northwest past housing developments. PA 252 passes to the southwest of Aronimink Golf Club before coming to an interchange with St. Davids Road and Newtown Street Road. Here, the name of the route changes to Darby Paoli Road and it narrows into a two-lane undivided road as it passes between wooded residential neighborhoods to the northeast and the Episcopal Academy to the southwest. Chester and Montgomery counties PA 252 northbound past Darby Road/Sugartown Road in Easttown TownshipAt the intersection with White Horse Road, PA 252 enters Easttown Township in Chester County and continues northwest through wooded areas of homes. The road passes to the east of Waynesborough Country Club before it comes to an intersection with Darby Road/Sugartown Road. At this intersection, the name of the route becomes Leopard Road and it passes more wooded development, crossing into Tredyffrin Township. PA 252 curves north and becomes a four-lane road, heading into commercial areas and coming to an intersection with US 30 in the community of Paoli. Past this intersection, the road becomes Bear Hill Road and immediately passes under Amtrak's Keystone Corridor. The route passes homes and narrows back to two lanes before heading into forested areas. PA 252 widens back into a four-lane divided highway and comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Dale Secondary railroad line, curving northeast. The road passes southeast of a residential neighborhood before it comes to an intersection with Swedesford Road/Howellville Road. At this point, the name of the route becomes Swedesford Road and it heads past business parks as a four- lane undivided road. The lanes of PA 252 split as it passes over the Chester Valley Trail and comes to a partial interchange with the US 202 freeway to the north, with access between northbound PA 252 and northbound US 202 and southbound US 202 and southbound PA 252. Following this, the route heads east- northeast as a two-lane undivided road, passing between the US 202 freeway to the north and businesses to the south. PA 252 curves east and turns northwest onto Valley Forge Road, immediately interchanging with US 202. The route continues through suburban neighborhoods in Chesterbrook before coming to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76, I-76). At this point, the road enters Valley Forge National Historical Park. PA 252 passes through fields within the park, turning west onto Valley Creek Road at the Baptist Road intersection. Upon intersecting Yellow Springs Road just east of the Knox Covered Bridge over the Valley Creek, the route turns north and enters Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County and winds north through forested areas along the east bank of the creek. PA 252 comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 23 near the community of Valley Forge. History Providence Friends Meetinghouse in Media on the east side of PA 252. The first meetinghouse was built here about 1700 Newtown Square Friends Meeting House built in 1711 in Newtown Square on the west side of PA 252. In 1683, the Court of Chester County (which then included present-day Delaware County) approved the construction of \\"Providence Great Road\\", which included the route of present-day PA 252 from the southern terminus to north of Media. The road was built to provide access to Chester from the north. The Providence Road was said to have been completed in 1684. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what would become PA 252 was designated as Legislative Route 144, running between Media and King of Prussia. At this time, the entire route was unpaved. PA 252 was designated by 1928 to run from PA 320 north of Chester north to US 122/PA 52 (now US 202) in King of Prussia, following its current alignment north to Wyola, where it turned northeast and intersected US 30 in Wayne before continuing north to King of Prussia. Between Wyola and King of Prussia, PA 252 followed what is now unnumbered portions of St. Davids Road, Brooke Road, Wayne Avenue, Radnor Road, Croton Road, and King of Prussia Road. At this time, the entire route was paved. By 1928, the current alignment of PA 252 was an unnumbered road between Wyola and Paoli, a part of US 122 between Paoli and Valley Forge Road, and a part of PA 83 north of there. The northern terminus of PA 252 was moved to PA 23 (Gulph Road) along Croton Road in King of Prussia by 1960 after the original alignment to US 202 along King of Prussia Road was severed by the construction of I-80S/PA 43 (Schuylkill Expressway, now I-76). By 1970, PA 252 was realigned to its current northern terminus at PA 23 near Valley Forge along its current alignment, running concurrent with US 202 between Paoli and the southern interchange with the US 202 freeway and replacing the PA 83 designation along Valley Forge Road and Valley Creek Road. Also by this time, the route was widened into a divided highway between Newtown Square and Wyola. By 1980, the US 202 concurrency was removed from PA 252. Major intersectionsPA 252 Alternate Truck Pennsylvania Route 252 Alternate Truck is a truck route around a weight- restricted bridge over the Crum Creek at the Springton Reservoir in Marple Township, on which trucks over 34 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The truck route follows Providence Road and PA 3 between Upper Providence Township and Newtown Square. It was signed in 2013.

The seat of Karnes County from 1854 to 1894, Helena was once known as the self-proclaimed \\"toughest town on earth\\" in the mid-19th century. It was named for the second wife of Dr. Lewis S. Owings, Helen M. Owings Swisher. The town was the birthplace of the so-called \\"Helena Duel\\", in which the left hands of two opponents are tied together with buckskin and each fighter is given a knife with a three-inch blade ‚Äî too short to reach a vital organ or cause a single fatal stab. After the combatants are whirled around a few times, they slash away at each other until one bleeds to death from the accumulation of cuts and stabs. Crowds of spectators would view this gory, gruesome spectacle and place bets on the outcome. Helena is a ghost town allegedly because of the vendetta that Colonel William G. Butler (1831‚Äì1912), a powerful rancher, had against the town he blamed for the death of his son, Emmett Butler, who had been killed by a stray bullet from a saloon brawl on December 26, 1884. A few days later, Colonel Butler went to Helena with group of cowhands and demanded to know who had shot his son and found that none of the townspeople was willing to tell the truth. Enraged, Colonel Butler reportedly shouted: \\"All right! For that I'll kill the town that killed my son!\\" Following through on his threat, Butler, a veteran of the American Civil War, arranged for the tracks of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway to be built away from Helena. Then, in a bitterly contested election in 1894 the county seat was moved from Helena to Karnes City. Helena quickly died. The popular character actor Jim Davis played the role of Colonel Butler in the 1969 episode \\"The Oldest Law\\" of the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor not long before Taylor's own death. Tom Lowell (born 1941) played Emmett Butler; Stacy Harris, the corrupt Mayor Ackerson, and Tyler McVey, Parson Blake.

The company billed itself as \\"offering warehouse-style shopping at the lowest possible prices.\\" The company was founded in 1981 by John Volken, an immigrant who arrived in Canada from East Germany in 1960 at the age of 18. It \\"was one of the first businesses to sell at warehouse prices and to operate without commission sales staff or in-store decor.\\" In 2001, the company had sales of CAN$210 million (approx. US$135 million). By 2003, the company had expanded to over 150 stores including 39 stores in the northwestern United States. With stores in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Utah, it was \\"one of the most widespread retail furniture chains in North America\\" and \\"one of Canada's most successful stateside retailers\\". However, in early 2003 they were forced to close all but 5 of their stores in the United States. By early 2004, the company had completely exited the U.S. market. As of March 2004, the company had reduced its size to 81 stores and was acquired by another national furniture retailer, The Brick. In 2006, The Brick rebranded 24 of these under their own name in an attempt to save on advertising costs and increase sales, which had fallen 10.8% in the third quarter of 2005 for established UFW stores. As of February 2010, the company had reduced its size to 36 stores across Canada - 15 in Ontario, 10 in Alberta, 5 in British Columbia, 3 in each of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Some time later, they re-entered the U.S. market with stores in Bellingham and Mount Vernon in Washington. Those two stores are still open, despite the United Furniture Warehouse name being retired in 2018. As of January 2014, the company had reduced its size yet again. Now there were 24 United Furniture Warehouse stores across Canada - 8 in each of Alberta and Ontario, 2 in British Columbia, and 3 in each of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. As of March 2017, the number of stores had decreased to 12. All UFW stores had been re-branded as UFW/The Brick Clearance Centre by that time. Stores have a mixture of new items on display, as well as clearance items. Later that year in July, all remaining UFW locations were switched to a new branding called ‚ÄúThe Brick Outlet‚Äù, along with renaming The Brick Clearance Centre locations. Advertisements United Furniture Warehouse had a well-known musical cue at the end of its broadcast ads, including the phrase \\"United Furniture Warehouse\\" sung in bass, followed closely by a \\"bump bump!\\" sound effect‚Äî a pair of orchestral hits that are simultaneous to the flashing of the company's logo on the screen. In one of its commercials, they poked fun at this fact, with an employee singing the jingle and a group of children pointing out, \\"You forgot the bump bump!\\" One commentator wrote the jingle was \\"maddeningly catchy\\".

He was trained by Antonio Gandini. Among his masterpieces is a large fresco about the life of Sant'Alberto (c. 1640) in the Carmelite church of Brescia, painted with Gandino's son, Bernardino. Biography The date of birth of the Amigoni, that had been open to discussion in artistic literature for a long period and fell anywhere between 1605 and 1665, was finally fixed with certainty only in 2006 after careful research in the parish archives of the church di Sant'Agata. It was discovered that he was born on 16 October 1606. He initially worked as a chemist at his father's workshop but, before 1632, for unknown reasons he had already traveled to Genoa and Bologna, getting from the first city the teaching of Bernardo Strozzi and from the second the method used by Bartolomeo Cesi, these motives were noticeable in his first famous work, San Rocco and Nicola da Tolentino invoke the Virgin to spare Sergnana from the plague in the presence of the saints Bartolomeo, Faustino and Giovita that is preserved in the church of San Rocco in Provezze. The altarpiece is dated 1632 and can be attributed to a first experiment, performed on the basis of the works seen during the two journeys just completed, works belonging to the worlds that were very different from the environment in Brescia. Closer to the \\"local\\" style appears his second known work, Madonna with Child between Saints Charles and Francis for the church of Siant Giorgio in Cellatica, signed and dated 1633. In the painting the influences of Genoa and Bologna were much more attenuated to give way to the lessons of Pietro da Marone, Paolo Veronese and Moretto. The following year, he painted a fresco of the two great monochromes of Saint Gregorio Magno and Saint'Onorio on the counter-fa√ßade of the church of Saints Faustino and Giovita in Brescia, where the shift towards more characteristic features of the Brescia area can be found. The activity of Amigoni in the second half of the 1630s, which would thus attest the evolution of his reunion with local art, remains obscure today due to the loss of some works that were fundamental in this sense. In the early 1640s, still for unknown reasons, he traveled to Switzerland and left the altarpiece of the Perdon d'Assisi in the church of San Francesco in Ruis, in the Surselva District, signed and dated 1642. It is therefore his first work, which has reached a certain attribution after the two frescoes of 1633. This work was also the beginning of the most prolific period of the painter, which lasted twenty years until his death. During this period he already matured in a personal style oriented more towards baroque features than mannerism of the Gandino.

Santa Maria dei Miracoli Immacolata Cristo e Maddalena Brescia.jpgThe Immaculate by Ottavio Amigoni and Noli me tangere by Giuseppe Fali in the Santa Maria dei Miracoli church in Brescia. In 1642 he signed the Madonna with Child and the saints Eufemia and Francesco in the parish church of Vello, thus testifying his return to Brescia, and again in the same year he executed the frescoes on the semi-dome of the apse and the central vault of the church of San Giorgio. The style of Amigoni, now turned to a true experimentation with contemporary baroque lines, does not stop in the second half of the 40s. We can still find it in the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli in Brescia with the paintings of 1648 of the Immaculate Conception and Presentation in the Temple of Mary (the first half-destroyed and the second completely destroyed in 1944 during a bombing), then again in Chiari, Paitone and Zone. Here he performs for the parish church a Madonna with Child, St. George, St. Rocco and a devotee, another masterpiece, where his experiments reached a certain stability, allowing the artist to return to the lessons learned at the beginning of his training and enrich them with the new, well-established baroque style. In the fifties of the seventeenth century he turned to light tones, while the traits are becoming increasingly important: this aspect is clearly visible, for example in San Gregorio Magno in the sanctuary of the Madonna della Misericordia in Bovegno, dated 1650. A masterpiece of early 50s is the Madonna with Child and Saint Bernard Abbot for the church of San Bernardo in Marone, with almost silver tones on twisted figures. For two years ( 1655-1656) Amigoni returns to painting frescos with the internal frieze of the church of Santa Maria della Carit√† in Brescia, executed together with Agostino Avanzo and now lost, and with the decoration of the Villa Togni salon in Gussago, created in collaboration with the young Pompeo Ghitti. After this date, however, the artist's tracks are becoming increasingly rare. In 1660 he reappeared with a shovel in the parish church of Gorzone depicting the Saints Ambrogio and Antonio da Padova. Ottavio Amigoni died on 28 October 1661 in his hometown and was buried in the church of San Giuseppe.

The date of the festival is based on the lunar cycle of the lunisolar Hindu calendar, falling on the first day of the year, in the Sindhi month of Chet (Chaitra). It typically falls in late March or early April in the Gregorian calendar on or about the same day as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra and Ugadi in other parts of the Deccan region of India. The festival marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in the Sindhi community, it also marks the birth of Uderolal in 1007, after they prayed to the Hindu god Varun Dev to save them from the persecution by the tyrannical Muslim ruler Mirkhshah. Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal, became the champion of the people in Sindh, from both religions. Among his Sufi Muslim followers, Jhulelal is known as \\"Khwaja Khizir\\" or \\"Sheikh Tahit\\". The Hindu Sindhi, according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal's birthday. The tradition likely started with Daryapanthis. During the British colonial rule era, major annual fairs (melas) used to be held in Uderolal and Zindapir (near Hyderabad, Pakistan). In contemporary times, the Sindhi community celebrates the festival of Cheti Chand with major fairs, feast parties, processions with jhankis (glimpse stage) of Jhulelal (an avatar of [Varun dev], similar to Vithoba), other Hindu deities, and social dancing. On this day, many Sindhis take Baharana Sahib, a representation of Jhulelal, to a nearby river or lake. Baharana Sahib consists of jyot (oil lamp), misiri (crystal sugar), fota (cardamom), fal (fruits), and akha. Behind is kalash (water jar) and a nariyal (coconut) in it, covered with cloth, phool (flowers) and patta (leaves). There is also a Murti (statue) of Pujya Jhulelal Devta. Cheti Chand is a major festival of Sindhi Hindus in India and Pakistan, and also celebrated by the Hindu Sindhi diaspora around the world.

It resembled its relative, Meiolania, save that the largest pair of horns on its head stuck out to the sides, rather than point backwards. It is only known from a mostly complete skull and the distal portion of a tail. Discovery and Taxonomy Restoration The remains of Ninjemys were found at the King's Creek locality in Queensland in 1879 by G. F. Bennett, an Australian collector. The King's Creek deposit is believed to be of Pleistocene age, though the precise dating is uncertain. Despite the fact that Bennett correctly identified the remains as that of a turtle, when they were sent to the Natural History Museum, Richard Owen mixed up the remains with the verebrae of Megalania, and subsequently with the foot bones of Diprotodon. He later described better remains of the related genus Meiolania from Lord Howe Island, so it was realised that this first known meiolaniid was actually a turtle. It was subsequently described by A. S. Woodward as Meiolania oweni.Woodward, A. S. 1888. \\"Notes on the Extinct Reptilian Genera Megalania, Owen, and Meiolania, Owen\\". Annals and Magazine of Natural History.

Gafney (1992) notes that this consists of a \\"tail club and single tail ring\\", this is assumed to belong to the holotype individual. In 1992, anatomical differences with the type species M. platyceps led to its placement in the new genus Ninjemys, which was named in honor of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Etymology The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) gives a 1589 quotation for this phrase as a friendly greeting, and quotations for the related phrase \\"hail fellow\\", a greeting that apparently dates to medieval times. \\"Well met\\" appears to have been added to the phrase in the 16th century to intensify its friendliness, and derives from the concept of \\"good to meet you\\", and also from the meaning of \\"meet\\" as something literally the right size for a given situation. Historic usage The expression appeared in Jonathan Swift's My Lady's Lamentation (1728). The phrase appears in a section entitled \\"Sad\\"‚Äîin the Aeolus episode‚Äîin James Joyce's novel, Ulysses (1918), at the end of a description of the behaviour of newspaper men: \\"Funny the way the newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same breath. Wouldn't know which to believe. One story good till you hear the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over. Hailfellow well met the next moment.\\" The early twentieth-century English novelist W. Somerset Maugham frequently used the term in his novels and short stories, in particular when he describes male characters of a genial, sociable, and hard-drinking temperament (e.g., Of Human Bondage, The Trembling of a Leaf, and Then and Now). Contemporary usage In modern English, the idiom is defined as \\"heartily friendly and congenial, comradely, hail-fellow‚Äîcharacteristic of or befitting a friend; 'friendly advice'; 'a friendly neighborhood'; 'the only friendly person here'; 'a friendly host and hostess'.\\" As such, the idiom is used as an exaggerated greeting, or as a description of a personality type. Hence, modern use of the term tends to be deliberately archaic, with overtones of over-familiarity in the person so described (almost always male), or as a deliberate, tongue in cheek term of endearment; in the latter case it heightens the effect of the greeting of an unexpected friend (as in \\"the only friendly person here\\"), or to communicate the idea of a friend in an otherwise unfriendly environment. Linguistic observations Kuiper uses the fact that this idiom is a phrase that is a part of the English lexicon (technically, a \\"phrasal lexical item\\"), and that there are different ways that the expression can be presented‚Äîfor instance, as the common \\"hail-fellow-well-met,\\" which appears as a modifier before the noun it modifies,The appearance of the idiom before the noun it modifies classifies its use in this case as a \\"prenominal modifier.\\" See Kuiper (2007), op. cit., [Needed here is a further citation to define the term.], and Maugham (1915), op. cit. for an example. versus the more original greeting form of \\"Hail fellow. Well met\\"; these variants are given as an example to explain how changes between the two (deformation), performed for the sake of artistry in writing (i.e., artistic deformation), can move alternative interpretations to the foreground (i.e., can create \\"syntactic ambiguity\\"); that is, ambiguity can be foregrounded by artistic deformation, including, Kuiper notes, toward the end of creating humorous interpretations.

In the collection of the Landesmuseum Joanneum Antonio Amorosi (1660 - 5 October 1738) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque, active in Ascoli Piceno and Rome. Amorosi was born in Comunanza, then part of the Papal States. In 1668, he moved to Rome where he was trained by Giuseppe Ghezzi.Memorie intorno i letterati e gli artisti della citt√† di Ascoli nel Picino, by Giacinto Cantalamessa Carboni, (183), page 267. He painted genre scenes similar to those of the Bamboccianti. Biography He was born in Comunanza in 1660 and moved to Rome in 1668 with the intention to become a priest, his interest in art and, in 1676, acquaintance with Giuseppe Ghezzi, made him change his mind and enter Giuseppe Ghezzi\`s workshop to remain there for 11 years. Around 1690 he became an independent painter. His first work, signed and dated 1690, was the Portrait of the child Filippo Ricci, now kept in the Weitzner private collection in New York. In 1699 he frescoed the Palazzo comunale of Civitavecchia with Pope Innocent III receiving the Magistrates of the city and with the Madonna and San Fermo, destroyed in 1944; in 1702 he painted, in the church of Santa Maria della Morte in Civitavecchia, the altarpiece Saint Gregorio and the souls of Purgatory. In the mid-seventeenth century appeared the first bambocciate, that is pictorial representations of scenes of popular life that took their roots in the pictorial culture of northern Europe9genre scenes). In Italy they were marked by grotesque elements and caricatures as it was the representation of life of the \\"popolino\\" shown to the aristocratic clientele. It is said that Amorosi\`s interest in genre scenes was fostered by artistic preferences of circle of the Spanish ambassador in Rome, the duke of Uceda, who was himself an important commissioner of Amorosi. In this environment, among other things, Amorosi met and became friends with his future biographer and art historian Leone Pascoli. His popular scenes remained a fundamental component of his artistic activity until his death, granting him commissions from wealthy clients, most belonging to the Roman aristocracy. In addition to genre scenes, he painted sacred themes, such as can be found in altarpieces in Rome. According to Pascoli, Amorosi was also a skilled copyist of Renaissance artists and a restorer. His son Filippo also collaborated in his father's workshop and was a painter of genre scenes.

They were housed in the Twelve Collegia building in Saint Petersburg. Building of the Twelve Collegia, 1753 engraving The reasons for establishing the colleges In 1718-19, the liquidation of the former state bodies took place, replacing them with new ones, more suitable for young Peter the Great Russia. The Senate founding in 1711 served as a signal for the establishing of the sectoral management bodies - colleges. According to the plan of the Peter the Great, they had to replace the awkward system of prikaz and bring two innovations into the administration: # The systematic separation of departments (orders often substituted each other, performing the same function that caused chaos in management. Moreover, some other functions were not at all covered by any clerical proceedings). # Advisory procedure for solving the cases. The form of the new central government was borrowed from Sweden and in Germany. The Sweden legislation became the basis for the development of the regulations for the legislation. Evolution of the college system Already in 1712, an attempt was made to establish a trading board with the participation of foreigners. In Germany and other European countries, experienced lawyers and officials were recruited to work in Russian state institutions. The Swedish boards were considered the best in Europe, and they were taken as a model. The college system, however, began to take shape only by the end of 1717. ‚ÄúBreaking‚Äù the order system overnight turned out to be difficult, so the one-time abolition had to be abandoned. Orders were either absorbed by the colleges, or subordinated to them (for example, seven orders were included in the Justice Board). Historic building of the Twelve Collegia now belongs to the Saint Petersburg State University Originally nine were established: *Collegium of Commerce *Collegium of Financial Inspection and Control *Collegium of Foreign Affairs *Collegium of Justice *Collegium of Manufacturing *Collegium of the Navy *Collegium of State Expenses *Collegium of State Income *Collegium of War Three more were later added: *Collegium of Estates *Collegium of Mining *Collegium of Town Organization Each collegium consisted of a president, a vice-president, four councilors, four assessors, a procurator, a secretary, and a chancellery. The collegia were replaced with ministries during the Government reform of Alexander I. In 1720, the Chief Magistrate was established (having the rights of the board). This body coordinated the work of all magistrates and being for them the Court of Appeal. Around 1720, the Justice college of Livland and Estland Affairs was established, from 1762 it was named the Justice college of Livonia, Estland and Finland Affairs, which dealt with administrative and judicial issues of the affiliated Swedish provinces, as well as the activities of Protestant churches on the empire territory. In 1721, the Collegium of Estates was established, replacing the Local Order. In 1722, the Berg-Manufacture college was divided into the Berg board and the Collegium of Manufacturing, and the Collegium of Little Russia (1722‚Äì27) board was established, replacing the Little Russia Office. In 1726, the College of Savings was established. In 1763, the Medical College was established. Because of the reform of local government carried out by Catherine the Great, by the mid-1780s the number of colleges sharply decreased. The redistributing of powers between central and local governments, and with the need to save the state funds, led to the fact that the colleges functions of local significance were transferred to the provincial institutions, and the functions of national importance to the Governing Senate. The colleges that continued to operate were only the Admiralty, Military, Foreign Affairs, Medical and Justice Board e of Livonia, Estonia and Finland. Some of the old colleges were restored for a while during the transformations done by Paul I of Russia, but during this period, the college management principle increasingly complied with the command unity principle in the framework of the project of establishing a ministerial system developed by the emperor. In particular, the Minister of Commerce headed the restored Commerce College. The college management took place by 1802, when the ‚ÄúManifesto on the Establishment of Ministries‚Äù laid the foundation for a more progressive, ministerial system. General Regulations The colleges activity was determined by the General Regulations approved by Peter I on February 28 (March 10), 1720 (lost its value with the publication of the Digest of Laws of the Russian Empire). The full title of this regulation is: ‚ÄúThe General Regulations or the Charter, according to which state colleges, as well as all the chancelleries and offices belonging to them, are servants, not only in external and internal institutions, but also in the administration of their rank, they have a subtle approach‚Äù. The General Regulations introduced an office administration called the ‚Äúcollegiate‚Äù after the name of the new type of institutions - colleges. The collegial way of making decisions by the presence of the collegium was dominant in these institutions. Peter I drew special attention to this form of decision-making, noting, ‚Äúall the best d through councils happens‚Äù (Chapter 2 of the General Regulations ‚ÄúOn the advantage of colleges‚Äù). Colleges Activity The Senate has appointed the presidents and the vice-presidents of the colleges (when appointing the president, the opinion of the tsar was taken into account). In addition to them, the new bodies included four advisers, four assessor (assessors), secretary, actuary (chancellery servant, who registered acts or their components), a registrar, a translator, clerks. The President was the first person in the college, but he could not decide anything without the consent of the members of the college. Vice-President replaced the President during his absence; usually helped him to carry out the tasks of a chairperson of the board. In 1718‚Äì1722, the presidents of the collegiums were part of the Senate, but then, only the presidents of the three most important collegiums (Foreign, Military, and Admiralty), and (temporarily) the President of the Berg College, participated at the meetings. The meetings of the collegiums were held daily, except Sunday and holidays. They began at 6 or 8 am, depending on the time of year, and lasted 5 hours. Materials for the colleges were prepared in the Office of the collegium, from where they were transferred to the General Presence of the Collegium, where they were discussed and adopted by the majority of votes. Issues on which the college failed to make a decision were transferred to Senate - the only institution to which the colleges were subordinate. At each college, there was a prosecutor, whose duty was to observe the correct and powerless solution of cases and the execution of decrees both by the college and by its subordinate structures. The secretary becomes the central figure of the office. The secretary was responsible for the collegium office operation: preparing cases for the hearing, reporting cases at the collegium meeting, conducting reference work on cases, making decisions and monitor their execution, keeping the seal of the collegium. The value of boards The established collegium system completed the process of centralization and bureaucratization of the state apparatus. A clear distribution of departmental functions, uniform standards of activity (according to the General Regulations) - all this significantly distinguished the new apparatus from the mandate system. In addition, the creation of colleges system of regionalism, which struck the last blow to the mestnichestvo system that was abolished in the early 1682, but which took place informally. Colleges‚Äô operation drawbacks The grandiose plan of Peter I to define the departmental functions and to give each official a clear plan of action was not fully implemented. Often colleges replaced each other (as once orders). Therefore, for example, Berg-, Manufactura- and Commerce- colleges could perform the same function. For a long time, outside the sphere of control of the collegiums, the most important functions remained ‚Äî police, lumi√®res, medicine, and the post offices. Gradually, however, new branch bodies, often called chancelleries, supplemented the collegium system. Thus, the Pharmaceutical Order, which was already operating in the new capital, St. Petersburg, was transformed into the Medical College since 1721, and since 1725 into the Medical Chancellery. Colleges‚Äô chancelleries could be both single-minded and collegial. Collective chancelleries did not have such a rigid and precise regulation as collegiums, but approached to them by structure and tasks.

The inevitable-disclosure doctrine is one's means in demonstrating a revelation of trade secrets, and some have recently found some renewed judicial support. Where it is acceptable, the doctrine allows the court to find that a former employee would disclose proprietary information in their position with a new employer, even if there is no evidence of actual disclosure. Thus, allowing a company to make a critical showing, when it can't do so if required to come forward with evidence of misconduct. However, because it also rests on a prediction about a future harm, inevitable disclosure also is in tension with the general principle that injunctive relief will not be given to prevent a conjectural injury at any means.

He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Dak To. Adopted as a child, Barnes joined the army after graduating from Dedham High School in 1964. After serving in the Dominican Civil War and completing a tour of duty in Vietnam, he volunteered to go back to the war. During his second tour, his unit came under attack during the Battle of Dak To. He was killed when he jumped on a grenade to save the lives of wounded comrades. For \\"conspicuous gallantry\\" that was \\"above and beyond the call of duty\\", Barnes received the Medal of Honor. Early life and education Barnes was born in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 1945. When he was two years old, he was adopted by John A. Barnes, Jr. and his wife, Katherine (n√©e Hermes). Their 18-year-old daughter, Carson, was a freshman in college at the time. From a young age, Barnes expressed an interest in joining the Army. As a child Barnes lived in Belmont before moving to Dedham during his sophomore year of high school. He wanted to leave Dedham High School early to become a Marine aviator, but his parents talked him into finishing. He graduated in 1964. He was described by his sister as \\"an average student, quiet, and shy,\\" as well as \\"very dedicated, very patriotic.\\" While in high school, he served in the Civil Air Patrol and drilled at the South Weymouth Naval Air Station. Career Shortly after graduating from Dedham High School Barnes enlisted in the United States Army and went through basic training at Fort Pickett. His sister was surprised he enlisted so soon after graduation, but said he \\"felt determined that it was the right thing to do.\\" Barnes also trained at the engineering school at Fort Benning. He served for a year in Santo Domingo during the Dominican Civil War. Vietnam War Barnes was dispatched to Vietnam as part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade on May 31, 1966, during the Vietnam War. Serving in Company C of the 1st Battalion, 503d Infantry, Barnes was assigned as a grenadier. Soldiers of the brigade became involved in Operation Attleboro in fall of 1966, an operation that started out as a small search and destroy mission north of Saigon but eventually involved 22,000 troops from 21 battalions. After serving a single tour Barnes was sent home, but volunteered to return to Vietnam and was sent back in the fall of 1967. According to Barnes' sister, his mother was very upset that he had volunteered to go back. On November 12, 1967, while patrolling in Dak To District of Kon Tum Province during the Battle of Dak To, Barnes' unit was attacked by a North Vietnamese battalion. During the battle, Barnes manned a machine gun that had lost its crew to enemy fire and was credited with nine enemy kills. While retrieving more ammunition, Barnes dived on top of a grenade that had landed among American wounded in order to use his body to protect them from the blast. The grenade exploded, killing Barnes. Medal of Honor Two years later, Barnes was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. His parents accepted the award on his behalf from Spiro Agnew in the Vice President's executive office in Washington, D.C. Carson and her husband, James Fleming, and the oldest four of their seven children also attended. The ceremony also honored Fr. Charles J. Watters and Robert F. Stryker. Barnes was also awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, and several other medals. =Citation= Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company C, 1st Battalion, 503d Infantry 173d Airborne Brigade.

His name is inscribed on Panel 29E ‚Äì Row 084 of the Vietnam War Memorial. Carson Barnes Fleming believed that the distress of the loss of Barnes contributed to the deaths of their parents in the years that followed. Within hours of learning that Barnes was to be awarded the Medal of Honor, a Blue Ribbon Commission was established by the Town of Dedham to make plans for a \\"John A. Barnes Memorial Day.\\" The Dedham High School class of 1968 established a scholarship in his name. On April 19, 1970, The Town of Dedham rededicated Memorial Field as John A. Barnes III Memorial Park. At the ceremony, dignitaries, V.F.W. members from dozens of towns, and local marching bands proceeded to the intersection of East Street and Eastern Ave., where a marble monument was unveiled in Barnes' honor. Among the speakers that day was Congressman James A. Burke. A building used by the United States Navy, located at 495 Summer Street in Boston, was renovated and renamed for Barnes. The street sign on Colwell Drive also now indicates that Barnes lived there.

Biography As a Jew, Varga lost his position at the Budapest Symphony during WW II and was later interned by Hungarian authorities in a Nazi labor camp. For 11 years Varga held the position as principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic under the baton of the orchestra's music directors Dimitri Mitropoulos and Leonard Bernstein, and many guest conductors including Fritz Reiner and Guido Cantelli. He performed as soloist with orchestras in countries such as Australia, Japan, USA, the former Soviet Union, and throughout Europe. In music festivals such as Aspen, Chautauqua, and Shreveport, he has been spotlighted during the last 40 years for his duties as a soloist, chamber musician and teaching mentor. During this time recorded a multitude of disks for numerous labels including Columbia, CRI, Decca, EMI, Musicelli, Period, Philips, RCA, Serenus, and Vox. Many composers throughout the world have requested that Mr. Varga give the first performance of their works. As a chamber musician he was a member of groups such as the Borodin Piano Trio, the Canadian String Quartet, the L√©ner String Quartet, the Trio Concertante, and the Crown Chamber Players. Indiana University awarded Varga with the title of Chevalier du Violoncelle for having dedicated his career as a teacher and soloist for the improvement of cello playing. He taught the cello at San Francisco State University (where he also taught conducting and oversaw the chamber music program), University of California at Santa Cruz, the University of Toronto and the University of Houston, from which he retired in 2000. He has the great pleasure of having many of his students landing jobs in orchestras and in universities throughout the globe. He routinely holds master classes and performs in recitals as well as conducts large groups of cello ensembles on all sides of the globe. Many of these take place during the various international Cello Congresses. He has been the conductor of orchestras in Budapest, Hungary and San Leandro, California, as well as Festivals in Aspen, Colorado and Shreveport, Louisiana. He not only conducted the Virtuosi of New York and the Virtuosi of San Francisco but he was founder of both of them. He has arranged many works of music which are published by MusiCelli Publications. Groups such as the Yale Cellos, the Saito Cello Ensemble, CELLO for Sony/Philips, MusiCelli, the Los Angeles I Cellisti, as well as his own New York Philharmonic Cello Quartet have recorded his arrangements.

It was also home to an informal migrant farm camp that was locally known as \\"Rancho Diablo\\", where the 800 residents of the settlement worked in the farms and lived off of the land to survive, who later moved east to Torrey Highlands after becoming displaced to make way for the Pacific Highlands Ranch development. The residential development of Pacific Highlands Ranch was approved by the City of San Diego in 1998, in which the majority of the community is being developed by Pardee Homes and the majority of the community has been developed in the 2000s. Geography The community is bordered to the north by Fairbanks Ranch and Rancho Santa Fe, to the south by Del Mar Mesa, to the east by Torrey Highlands, and to the west by Carmel Valley. State Route 56 (Ted Williams Freeway) passes through this community. 1,300 acres (49 percent) of this community is preserved as natural habitat. Demographics According to January 2010 estimates by the San Diego Association of Governments, there were 4,224 people and 1655 households residing in the neighborhood. The estimated racial makeup was 68.5% White, 17.4% Asian & Pacific Islander, 11.7% Hispanic, 1.6% from other races, 0.4% African American, and 0.2% American Indian. The median age was 40.9 with 22.7% under the age of 18 and 13.2% over the age of 65. The estimated median household income was $269,757 (current dollars); 47% of the community made more than $200,000; 52% made between $60,000 and $199,999; and 1% made less than $60,000. Education Public schools in this community include Sycamore Ridge elementary (Del Mar Union School District) and Canyon Crest Academy (San Dieguito Union High School District). The only private school in this community is Cathedral Catholic High School (Roman Catholic); however, San Diego Jewish Academy, located in Carmel Valley, is within close proximity of the western border of Pacific Highland Ranch.

Holy Trinity Catholic High School is a private, co-educational college- preparatory school. It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin. History Holy Trinity was established as an independent school by a group of committed parents in 1997 with a core group of twelve freshmen, and made possible only through the generosity and facilities of St. Luke's Catholic Church in Temple. The school was housed in the Religious Education Building on the St. Luke's campus. Adding bus transportation in January 2001 allowed students from south and west Bell County to attend the school. During its first four years, Holy Trinity added many athletic and extra-curricular programs to the school, including the first drama production, first newspaper, and first yearbook in 2000. The first class graduated from Holy Trinity in 2001. In August 2001, the school moved to the Vandiver school building, a historic school building owned by the Temple Independent School District. In 2004, the school was allowed use of the adjacent modular building, now known as the Assisi Annex. In 2005, Holy Trinity secured a donation of a portable science building from the Cameron Independent School District and through the generosity of the EBCO company was able to move the building, creating the EBCO Science Center. In 2007, the school added another modular building, now known as the Aquinas Math Building. During the past several years, Holy Trinity increased academic offerings to include many advanced placement and dual credit classes. In recent years, the school has had success in extra- curricular activities, including five state championships in academics, two state championships in boys' golf, and girls state championship in 2009 and 2010. On November 30, 2010, the students, faculty, staff, parents and volunteers moved the school to its new facility at 6608 W. Adams Avenue. The move to the 31-acre campus marked a significant turn for the school. In 2012 the school built the Tornado Safe Shelter which is used as a cafeteria and auditorium. Prior to this building, lunch was eaten in the gym, and all school events were held in the gym as well.

Taxonomy This species was formerly treated as containing two subspecies - P. m. macroptera and P. m. gouldi, the latter of which is endemic to New Zealand. As of 2014, the latter is recognized as a species in its own right, the grey-faced petrel (Pterodroma gouldi). In 2016 further research was published supporting the full species status of the grey-faced petrel. Description This is a large seabird, with a body length of 42‚Äì45 cm. The bird is completely dark brown except for a variable patch of white near the base of the bill, which is black. It is separated from sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater by the all-dark underwing, the thick, stubby bill, and different jizz. The similar flesh-footed shearwater has a light, pinkish bill. Petrels in the genus Procellaria are larger and have a less bounding flight. Distribution Young bird The great-winged petrel breeds in the Southern Hemisphere between 30 and 50 degrees south with colonies on Tristan da Cunha, Gough Island, the Crozet Islands, the Prince Edward Islands, the Kerguelen Islands and on the coasts of southern Australia. It is a rare vagrant to the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California, United States. Ecology The species feeds mostly on squid and to a lesser degree on fish and crustaceans. Prey is generally caught at night, by dipping and surface-seizing. The great- winged petrel will on occasion follow whales and associate with other related bird species to feed. Breeding occurs in the southern winter (beginning in April); nests are either solitary or in small colonies, located in burrows or aboveground among boulders or low vegetation.

The species is an endemic breeder of New Zealand, breeding only on Great Barrier Island and Little Barrier Island, off the North Island. At sea it disperses as far as Australia and Ecuador. Description The plumage of the black petrel is all black, as are its legs and bill except for pale sections on bill. It is a medium-sized petrel (average about ), with a wingspan averaging 110 cm. Distribution It is endemic to New Zealand. It was previously found throughout the North Island and Northwest Nelson in the South Island, but predators (feral cats, pigs) caused their extinction on the mainland from about the 1950s (Medway 2002). It is often seen in the outer Hauraki Gulf from October to May.

Males will return to the same burrow every year and try to attract another female if their mate does not return or if there is a ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù (about 12% annually) (Bell et al. 2011). Pairs then depart on ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù, returning to the colony again in late November when the females lay a single egg (Imber 1987). Both birds share incubation of the egg for 57 days (about 8 weeks) (Imber 1987). Eggs can hatch from late January through February (Imber 1987). Chicks fledge after 107 days (15 weeks) from mid-April through to late June (Imber 1987) - about 75% of chicks survive to fledge (Bell et al. 2011). In 2011 breeding success fell to 61% (Bell, unpublished data) for unknown reasons. Adults and chicks migrate to South America for winter (to waters off the Ecuador coast) (Imber 1987, Bell et al. In press B) ‚Äì only 10% of fledged chicks survive this first year. Juveniles will remain at sea in the West Pacific for 3‚Äì4 years until they are ready to breed ‚Äì survival rate is 46% during this time vs 90% for birds over 3 years old (Bell et al. 2011). At about 4 years old, pre-breeding birds will fly back to the colony to find a mate ‚Äì this may take 1-2 seasons (Bell et al. 2011) Off Wollongong, Australia Feeding They may feed at night or during the day (unlike albatrosses which do not feed at night) (Imber 1976). Birds will aggressively follow fishing boats and long line hooks and may dive up to 20m below the surface after baits (Imber 1976). Black petrels can cover amazing distances ‚Äì the longest recorded foraging trip for a bird from Great Barrier Island is 39 days (Bell et al. 2009, Bell et al. In press). Mapping of foraging patterns against fishing activity in New Zealand waters is currently underway (see reports ‚Äì Bell et al. 2009, Bell et al. In press). Status and conservation The black petrel is classified under DOC Threat Classification System as Nationally Vulnerable (Miskelly et al. 2008) and by the International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN Red list: Vulnerable. Land-based population research at their breeding colonies since 1995 indicates the species is declining at a rate of at least 1.4% per year (Bell et al. In press A). At current survival rates, a fledged bird has a 1 in 20 chance of reaching breeding age (4+ years) and must breed 20 times successfully just to replace the current population. Threats to survival Auckland Museum While at sea, black petrels are caught by commercial and recreational fishers both in New Zealand and overseas (Abraham et al. 2010, Thompson 2010, Richard et al. 2011). Ministry of Fisheries research shows the black petrel is the most at-risk seabird in New Zealand from commercial fishing, estimating that between 725 and 1524 birds may have been killed each year in the period 2003 to 2009 (Richard et al. 2011). Petrels may be drowned by taking long line hooks after they are set (launched) or when they are being pulled onto boats. Inshore snapper and bluenose bottom long-line fisheries are the greatest risks, especially where fisheries overlap with foraging patterns of breeding birds (Richard et al. 2011). Reported deaths by fishers are low ‚Äì since 1996, there have been only 38 birds reported caught and killed in New Zealand waters by local commercial fishers, mainly on domestic tuna long-line and on snapper fisheries (Richards et al. 2011, Thompson 2011, Bell et al. In Press A). Less than 0.5% of boats in these high risk fisheries had observers on board in any one year. The level of deaths in fisheries outside New Zealand waters is unknown. There are anecdotal capture reports from recreational fishers especially in the outer Hauraki Gulf (Abraham et al. 2010) where birds are commonly reported. On Great Barrier Island feral pigs are known to dig up burrows and eat eggs and chicks ‚Äì in one example in 1996 pigs destroyed 8 burrows in one incident (Bell & Sim 1998). Feral cats can kill adults on the ground or at the nest as well as chicks. Cat numbers on Great Barrier Island are impacted by trapping by the Department of Conservation in the Whangapoua basin but there has been no specific protection of the colony to date. Kiore and ship rats are also present on Great Barrier Island but predation levels are between 1 and 6.5% per annum (Bell et al. 2011); kiore cannot eat through a black petrel egg. Risk to black petrel survival from a one-off event/events is significant due to limited habitat for breeding / i.e. a single site on Hirakimata on Great Barrier Island (for example fire, storm damage or predator invasion at main colony).

Prarthana Samaj was founded by the Dadoba Pandurang and his brother Atmaram Pandurang in 1867 when Keshub Chandra Sen visited Maharashtra, with an aim to make people believe in one God and worship only one God. It became popular after Mahadev Govind Ranade joined. The main reformers were the intellectuals who advocated reforms of the social system of the Hindus. It was spread to southern India by noted Telugu reformer and writer, Kandukuri Veeresalingam. The movement was started as a movement for religious and social reform in Maharashtra and can be seen much more alike Brahmo Samaj. The precursor of the Prarthana Samaj in Mumbai was the Paramahamsa Sabha, a secret society for the furtherance of liberal ideas by Ram Balkrishna Jaykar and others in Mumbai. It was secret in order to avoid the wrath of the powerful and orthodox elements. Old Members of Prarthana Samaj  Religious reforms  By comparison with the parallel Brahmo Samaj of Bengal, and the ideals of rational or theistic belief and social reform, the Prarthana Samaj(ists) were followers of the great religious tradition of the Marathi Sant Mat like Namdev, Tukaram. The Brahmo Samaj founders examined many world religions, including ancient Vedic texts, which subsequently were not accepted to be infallible or divine. Although the adherents of Prarthana Samaj were devoted theists, they also did not regard the Vedas as divine or infallible. They drew their nourishment from the Hindu scriptures and used the hymns of the old Marathi \\"poet-saints\\" in their prayers. B. N. Luniya, \\"Rajendra Suri: A Reformer and Revivalist\\". Their ideas trace back to the devotional poems of the Vitthalas Vitthalas (Varkari Panth), PHILTAR, St. Martin's College. as part of the Vaishnava bhakti devotional movements of the thirteenth century in southern Maharashtra. \\"Prarthana Samaj\\", PHILTAR, St. Martin's College. The Marathi poets had inspired a movement of resistance to the Mughals. But, beyond religious concerns, the primary focus of the Prarthana Samaj was on social and cultural reform.  Social reforms  Prarthana Samaj critically examined the relations between contemporary social and cultural systems and religious beliefs and gave priority to social reform as compared with the political changes already initiated by the British government. Their comprehensive reform movement has led many impressive projects of cultural change and social reform in Western India, such as the improvement of the lot of women and depressed classes, an end to the caste system, abolition of child marriages and infanticide, educational opportunities for women, and remarriage of widows. Its success was guided by Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, a noted Sanskrit scholar, Dr. Atmaram Pandurang, Narayan Chandavarkar, and Justice Mahadev Govinda Ranade. Ranade emphasized that \\"the reformer must attempt to deal with the whole man and not to carry out reform on one side only\\".

Plot Irritated neighbor Wendell Burnshaw (Philip Ober) brings the Larkin family to the attention of the Internal Revenue Service. Lorenzo Charlton (Tony Randall) is assigned to the case by his boss, Kelsey (Fred Clark). Ma (Una Merkel) and Pop Larkin (Paul Douglas) warmly welcome him to their family farm in Maryland, at first unaware of why he is there. Lorenzo is aghast to learn that the Larkins have never filed a tax return. With their cooperation, he sets out to figure out what, if anything, they owe in the way of back taxes, a difficult task, as Pop usually just trades for what they need and keeps no records. Lorenzo and the eldest Larkin daughter, Mariette (Debbie Reynolds), become attracted to each other, but he does not let that get in the way of his work, at least not at first. However, as time goes by, he begins to loosen up and lose some of his buttoned-down mentality. When Kelsey and Burnshaw drop by to check his progress, Kelsey is displeased with this development. He takes charge of the investigation and sends Lorenzo back to the office in disgrace. Kelsey calculates the Larkins owe $50,000. The Larkins are unable to pay such a large sum, so Kelsey tells them they can either sell the farm to Burnshaw or face foreclosure. The Larkins' many friends rally round them and offer to buy some of their junk for inflated prices, but Pop proudly turns them down. Meanwhile, Mariette goes to see Lorenzo. The family's only hope is a receipt for 30 horses bought by the government in the American Civil War and never paid for. With great difficulty, they manage to see Inspector General Bigelow (Charles Lane). His legal department calculates that the Larkins are owed, with all the interest that has accrued, over $14 million. Pop decides not to accept it, as he did nothing to earn it, but Lorenzo gets Bigelow to agree to apply it against all present and future taxes owing.

According to the 22 November 2004 report of the Regina Planning Commission to the Mayor and City Council, \\"The current directions of residential [growth] for Regina (northwest, southeast and infill in existing areas of development) were essentially established in 1961‚Ä¶and ‚Ä¶[i]n the most recent review of the Development Plan undertaken in 2001, it was determined that these directions continue to be the most appropriate for the next 20 years.\\"Regina Planning Commission report to the Mayor and City Council, 22 November 2004 retrieved 10 June 2007. An eighth general residential category,therefore, is: :(8) the newer residential subdivisions in the east, north and northwest precincts of the city, planned in anticipation of gradual urban growth over several decades, a development which now with Saskatchewan's recent and unexpected economic boom is occurring in a matter of years rather than decades. Downtown business district Old Post Office and Scarth Street Mall, among other downtown precincts increasingly turned from commercial to residential use. Note East Tower of the new McCallum-Hill buildings in background. Hotel Saskatchewan on Victoria Avenue, south side of Victoria Park, circa 1930. The downtown business district, latterly and somewhat confusingly to the historically-minded deemed \\"Market Square\\" by civic boosters (the historic Market Square was on the current site of the Regina City Police headquarters and was the site of the Regina Riot), is located between Saskatchewan Drive and the CPR line to the north, Albert Street to the west, Broad Street to the East and Victoria Avenue to the south. The historical heart of Regina and noted nationally for its widespread destruction in the Regina Cyclone of 1912, it is nowadays possibly more to be noted for its former significance as commercial and residential growth has relocated to the periphery of the city, and indeed many historically significant landmarks and buildings have long since been demolished and forgotten. New apartment buildings and condominium residential development in older commercial and office buildings in, for example, the Scarth Street Mall and the Motherwell Building, show promise of revitalising the city core; the Cornwall Centre, an impressive inner city shopping mall originally with Eaton's and Hudson's Bay Company department stores as its anchors together with large cinemas, has not yet thrived but growing posh residential redevelopment could spur new vitality if urban crime spilling over from North Central can be stemmed. Former commercial and office facilities along Scarth Street are now strata title apartments. Historic entertainment venues and churches have largely lapsed but the Globe Theatre has relocated from the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts to the Old Post Office on 11th Avenue; the conversion of the Union Station to a casino and the construction of several new hotels are bringing new night life vitality to the Central Business District, albeit with the urgent caveat that urban crime spilling over from the North Central remains a serious issue. Currently, the downtown covers 82 hectares, . \\"Cathedral Area\\" (the West End) West End (\\"Cathedral Area\\") and the Crescents, showing location relative to Exhibition Park, Taylor Field, central business district, Wascana Creek and Wascana Lake. Weir holding back Wascana Lake is under the Albert Street Bridge.In 1927, the City of Regina passed its first zoning bylaw, setting the patterns for land use in the area. Over time, additional bylaws encouraged the construction of high-density housing, which replaced older housing near Albert Street. A 235-hectare (581 acres) largely residential area west of downtown Regina, this neighbourhood is defined as the area west of Albert Street, northeast of Wascana Creek and south of the CPR mainline. The area has some commercial properties on the north and east and along the 13th Avenue shopping district, the neighbourhood's main street. Holy Rosary Roman Catholic Cathedral on 13th Avenue opened in 1913, and it is the source of real estate agents' now popular sobriquet of the \\"Cathedral Area,\\" the area previously having been known as the West End. Immediately to the east of Holy Rosary on 13th Avenue is Westminster United (formerly Presbyterian) Church, also a construction of 1913, and the other major place of worship in the West End. When Holy Rosary found itself without a meeting house after the catastrophic fire of 1976 Westminster gladly provided it with a worship space for the duration of the repairs. In recent years the West End has come to be perceived both as a bohemian enclave and an area of economic need. There are, however,pockets of decidedly affluent housing throughout the Cathedral Area, extending intermittently from the immediate west of Albert Street right to Pasqua Street. Holy Rosary Cathedral has always been a centre of high culture in Regina and Westminster Presbyterian, later United, Church has been an √©lite bastion throughout its history while never forsaking its liberal Evangelical Protestant mandate of doing good as well as being good. Both Holy Rosary and Westminster (perhaps as well as St Mary's Anglican in the Crescents) draw parishioners ‚Äî and make it a matter of urgency that they do so ‚Äî not only from among the Anglo-Saxon/Irish √©lite but also from among the less advantaged persons in their geographical purview. On the perimeter of the West End on Albert Street is First Presbyterian Church, built in 1926 and founded by non- concurring dissidents from Westminster, Knox and Carmichael United Churches who objected to their several Presbyterian Church congregations' entry into the United Church of Canada ‚Äî all Regina Presbyterian congregations had entered into the United Church. First Presbyterian, however, is perhaps a church more of the posh South Albert and Lakeview precincts than of the West End, the latter having been amply served by the two existing United Churches of Westminster and Wascana. (Wascana's plain vernacular style wooden meeting house originally stood on 14th Avenue as Fourteenth Avenue Methodist Church and was moved in 1925 to its new site at 13th and Pasqua; it was sold in the 1960s when Wascana United built a new church; the congregation subsequently merged with that of Westminster.) By the 1970s, inner-city problems had arisen to some extent ‚Äî declining and aging population, decreasing quality of housing stock, increasing crime, heavier vehicular traffic and fewer parking places ‚Äî although, unlike other older residential areas of town, the population base and indeed the number of young families remained sufficiently high that the now nearly century-old Connaught Public and Holy Rosary Separate Schools remained continuously in use while several other elementary schools were demolished and not replaced. By the middle of the 1970s, area residents organised the Cathedral Area Community Association. Through the work of the associations ‚Äî as well as joint municipal, provincial and federal social programs ‚Äî local conditions improved. In addition, the spread on non- residential properties and high-density housing was controlled, and a large number of older homes in the area were renovated extensively.Source: The Cathedral Area in recent years has become a desirable residential neighbourhood by reason of its latter-day atmosphere of rakishness: the old Sacred Heart Academy, formerly a private girls' high school operated by the Western Canada-based Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions, immediately adjacent to the Roman Catholic Cathedral on 13th Avenue at Garnet Street, has been redeveloped as tony townhouses; many formerly rundown houses have been expensively renovated. On the other hand, recent cuts to the Cathedral Area Community Association have put many of the community programs and festivals, that created the renewed atmosphere, in jeopardy.

Note horse-drawn draysNot historically a residential neighbourhood, the Warehouse District is immediately to the north and east of the downtown central business district, beyond the CPR rail line (see map, below). Before the highways were upgraded to the extent that they permitted trans-Canada commercial shipping by road within Canada, and did not require trucking companies to dip below the 49th parallel to traverse the Great Lakes, and prior to the emergence of the airlines as a preferred mode of passenger travel and freight carriage, the railways were, as Sir John A. Macdonald‚Äôs National Policy had envisaged, at first the sole and for long the principal conduit linking Canada together. In Regina the warehouses were commercial depots for the receipt of goods from eastern Canada and the USA. With the eclipse of the railroads by the highways the Warehouse District lost its original raison d‚Äô√™tre and for a time the warehouses seemed in danger of becoming white elephants. Warehouse District, Dewdney Avenue, 2008 Beginning in the 1970s and ‚Äò80s imaginative property developers took their cue from the transformation of similarly outmoded warehouse districts in major eastern North American cities ‚Äì television dramas and comedies set in New York, Chicago and Toronto and house-beautiful home decoration magazines played a considerable part ‚Äì and began transforming the increasingly idle warehouses into tony restaurants and shopping precincts, live music clubs, condominiums and loft apartments which had the amenity of immediate proximity to professional employment venues in the central business district, just across the CPR tracks, and retail outlets in the new Cornwall Centre and elsewhere in the central business district. The Warehouse District has become a highly desirable night life precinct and residential address in Regina and appears likely to become a salutary exception to the general trend of commercial and residential development during the postwar years away from the city centre to the periphery. North Central Map of North Central (outlined in yellow), north of the CPR tracks between Pasqua (or Lewvan) and Broad Streets north to McKinley Avenue, except for the Warehouse District, south of Dewdney Avenue and east of Albert Street. The Warehouse District is shown and also the northern sectors of the Cathedral area and the downtown business district south of the CPR tracks. The map shows Exhibition Park; Pasqua Hospital, the old Regina cemetery; Scott Collegiate, Herchmer and Kitchener public schools and Sacred Heart separate school. North Central is contained within a trapezium described by the CPR tracks to the south, which divides North Central from the downtown business district; Broad Street to the east; Alexandra Street (two blocks west of Pasqua) to the west; and McKinley Avenue to the north. The increasingly tony Warehouse District being historically a non-residential sector and not part of North Central, is an exception to the generally depressed economic circumstances of the region immediately north of the CPR tracks and is appropriately hived off from the map. The largest of Regina's inner city neighbourhoods, it was originally established in the mid-1880s to accommodate European labourers working on the Canadian Pacific Railway. It subsequently became a prosperous middle class precinct.

Since the federal government's amendments to the Indian Act (R.S., 1985, c. I-5) removed restrictions on mobility of Status Indians (a Status Indian being an aboriginal person who is registered under the Act: see Indian Act), the neighbourhood's aboriginal population has steadily risen; current estimates show that one-third of the neighbourhood's 12,000-odd population is of aboriginal ethnicity.North Central ‚Äì Regina, Saskatchewan Action for Neighbourhood Change website.

It is estimated that there are more IV drug users in North-Central per capita than in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Although crime rates in the area remain relatively high, they have fallen in recent years due to efforts by the Regina Police Service and several agencies, including a stolen vehicle program, an anti-drug strategy, and an increase in the number of police officers in the area. This has been a national trend for some time. http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/050721/d050721a.htm As of November 2006, nearly 18% of the crime in Regina occurred in this neighbourhood, which has less than 6% of the population, or a 153-block area containing approximately (by another estimate) 10,500 people. In recent years the local government's commitment to invest in the inner-city has been questioned in view of its attempts to close inner-city library branches and a proposal to implement a base tax which would have lowered property taxes in outlying areas, where average household income for all residents is more than triple that of all residents in the inner city ‚Äî but would have increased taxes for inner-city properties. A change in funding structure will result in the three low income neighbourhoods of Cathedral Area, Al Ritchie and Argyle Park having funding reduced by $40,000 collectively and North Central having funding increased by $15,000. The $494,000 necessary to reach this target have not been fully provided. Positive efforts to engage the social problems in North-Central include the Inner City Family Foundation, community association programs and a rental property inspection team provided via a volunteer organization. The City of Regina has legal authority to create a rental licensing program and an inspection team, but has not yet implemented either of these solutions. At the beginning of 2007, City Council increased funding for six inner-city community associations by $19,000, but disbursed the total $369,000 to an additional 18 associations. A January 2007 article in Maclean'sGatehouse, op. cit. has helped prompt the city government to look at new ways of providing better housing to residents. The mayor has met with First Nations chiefs to create a dialogue, the first time during his six-year tenure in office. Also, It has spurred renewed discussion of establishing Regina's first urban reserve within the city, in association with the Piapot Cree Nation. Several years ago, the City of Regina negotiated a servicing agreement with the Nekaneet First Nation to establish an urban reserve in the northeast Industrial Area. The reserve has not yet been approved by the federal government. Newer residential subdivisions Residential streetscapes in south Regina subdivision of Albert Park, developed in the 1960s Decorative storm reservoir in the east Regina subdivision of Windsor Park, characteristic of both eastern and northern new residential subdivisions There is an increasingly likely population explosion in Saskatchewan cities and towns as the economy continues to boom at a rate unprecedented since the 1920s. Regina urban planners confront the issue of making new Regina neighbourhoods suitably comfortable for Saskatchewan expatriates long resident elsewhere in North America and now returning to live in the province. Increasingly also this becomes necessary as to people from elsewhere in Canada and the world who may have rather greater expectations as to urban amenity than previously obtained when Reginans were drawn from the Saskatchewan hinterland and were perhaps somewhat forgiving. School playgrounds, both those associated with functioning schools and those which were former playgrounds of now-closed schools, are increasingly converted to landscaped parks. New residential subdivisions in the north and east sectors of the city nowadays contain an abundance of parks with, frequently, decorative lagoons containing spring run-off and summer rain catchment instead of the older model of utilitarian storm ravines.

It formerly included the very similar Olrog's gull as a subspecies, but that bird occurs on the Atlantic coast of South America and is now accepted as Larus atlanticus. Belcher's gull is a medium-sized gull with a blackish mantle, white head and underparts, a black band on the otherwise white tail, and a yellow bill with a red and black tip. Non-breeding adults have a brownish- black head and a white eye-ring. The name of this bird commemorates the British explorer Sir Edward Belcher who performed survey work on the Pacific coast of South America. Description The band on the tail is a diagnostic feature Belcher's gull grows to a length of about . The sexes are similar in appearance and in the breeding season, the adult has a white head and very pale grey neck and underparts. The mantle and back are greyish-black and the tail is white with a broad black subterminal band and a white trailing edge. The wing coverts and primaries are black and the secondaries dark grey with white tips. The eye is black, the bill yellow with a distinctive red and black tip, and the legs and feet yellow. Outside the breeding season the head is dark brown with a white ring surrounding the eye. The juvenile is mottled brown and white and attains the adult plumage during its third year. Belcher's gull can be confused with the slightly larger kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) but that species has a small white tip on its otherwise black wing and lacks the Belcher's gull's black band on its tail. Distribution and habitat Belcher's gull is found on the Pacific coast of South America. Its range extends from northern Peru to northern Chile in the area influenced by the Humboldt Current and its habitat includes rocky shores, bays and offshore islands. It ventures several kilometres offshore to forage and also feeds on rocky shores when the tide is out. It is a non-migratory species. Ecology Looking for food in the beach in Peru Belcher's gull is an omnivore and scavenger. It feeds on fish, crabs, molluscs and carrion, and seasonally on the eggs and nestlings of seabirds. It often associates with Guanay cormorants, pestering them until they regurgitate their prey which it then consumes. Breeding takes place from December onwards in small colonies of up to one hundred pairs. The nest is a scrape in the sand or among rocks near the high tide line. There are usually three eggs averaging , pale blotched with dark olive markings. Status Belcher's gull is estimated to have a total population of under ten thousand individuals and an estimated distribution range of . Persecution of this bird by humans has diminished and its population is thought to be increasing.

The tour was organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club and matches outside the Tests were played under the MCC name. The tour included five Test matches in Australia, and England won The Ashes by four games to one. The tour was highly controversial because of the bodyline bowling tactics used by the England team under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine. After the Australian tour was over, the MCC team moved on to play in New Zealand, where two further Test matches were played.

Front row: Herbert Sutcliffe, Bob Wyatt, Douglas Jardine, Gubby Allen, Wally Hammond The MCC team was captained by Douglas Jardine, with Bob Wyatt as vice- captain. Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet were joint managers. The team members were: * Douglas Jardine, Surrey, team captain & batsman * Bob Wyatt, Warwickshire, vice-captain & batsman * Gubby Allen, Middlesex, all-rounder * Les Ames, Kent, wicket-keeper * Bill Bowes, Yorkshire, fast bowler * Freddie Brown, Surrey, leg break bowler * George Duckworth, Lancashire, wicket-keeper * Wally Hammond, Gloucestershire, all-rounder * Harold Larwood, Nottinghamshire, opening fast bowler * Maurice Leyland, Yorkshire, batsman * Tommy Mitchell, Derbyshire, leg break bowler * Nawab of Pataudi, Worcestershire, batsman * Eddie Paynter, Lancashire, batsman * Herbert Sutcliffe, Yorkshire, opening batsman * Maurice Tate, Sussex, all-rounder * Hedley Verity, Yorkshire, left arm spin bowler * Bill Voce, Nottinghamshire, opening fast bowler Walter Robins and Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji were invited to tour, but declined to do so, the latter because of ill-health. Test matches=First Test An easy victory for England, with Bradman absent for Australia. McCabe provided Australia's only significant resistance with the bat; Larwood claimed ten match wickets. Pataudi's century on Test debut was to be his sole Test century, and he was dropped after the second Test due to his dissent against Bodyline tactics (when he refused to move to a leg-side fielding position, Jardine is said to have commented \\"I see his highness is a conscientious objector\\"). Second Test Bradman is bowled first ball, 30 December 1932 On his return, Bradman was bowled first ball in the first innings when expecting a bouncer; Fingleton was left to hold Australia's first innings together. Nonetheless, an unbeaten century for Bradman in the second innings, and ten wickets for O'Reilly, granted Australia their only victory of the Test series. Third Test The match best known for Bodyline, with Woodfull receiving a blow to the chest (although he stayed at the crease to make an obdurate 73 not out) and Oldfield a fractured skull from Larwood's hostile fast bowling. Larwood took seven wickets in the match, but the principal wicket-taker was Allen, who took four in either innings despite his notable dissent against Bodyline. Fourth Test A match best remembered for the heroism of Paynter, who despite spending much of the match in hospital with severe tonsillitis, scored 83 in the first innings, and won the match with a six in the second. Bellevue Hotel, where the English team stayed during the fourth test Fifth Test Fine performances from both sides' middle orders (with some aid from dropped catches) led to approximate parity after the first innings. Hammond (101) and Larwood (98) in particular batted excellently; Larwood, promoted to number four as a night-watchman, scored the then highest innings ever made in that role. Bradman and Woodfull shared a partnership of 115 in Australia's second innings before Verity induced a collapse, and Wyatt and Hammond experienced little difficulty in reaching a target of 164, with Hammond in particularly belligerent form. Ceylon The English team had a stopover in Colombo en route to Australia and played a one- day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status.

History St. Mary's School was founded in 1897 under the name of St. Mary's Academy by Father Heckmann, pastor of St. Mary's Church. Under his direction, with the support of a group of parishioners, Divine Providence Sisters guided the pupils for several years. The Divine Providence Sisters withdrew in 1912 and not until 1919 could teaching sisters be found to continue their good work. Sisters of the Congregation of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament from Houston, Texas, began at St. Mary's School in 1919 and had a presence in the school until the retirement in May 1995 of long-time librarian, Sister James Philip Davison. In 1974, Mrs. Loris Edwards became the first lay principal. Today, the school is staffed by lay teachers. Academics In addition to its emphasis on moral development, St. Mary's prides itself on academics and is a presence at the PSIA tournaments every year. It has hosted the academic competitions several times at its school. Elementary students study the core subjects of math, English, science, social studies, and religion. Middle school continues with each of these but also adds Spanish as a core class. Elementary students do have weekly music, band, Spanish, and technology classes. Middle school students have electives, which include creative writing, drama, technology, guitar, choir, art 1 and 2, band, bible study, and study hall. Elementary students also have electives such as baking and home ec. Buildings The school is divided up into two interwoven campuses, the Reagan campus and the Parish campus. The Parish campus was the home for the school for 105 years. The school, because of a rise in its student body, acquired a recently closed down elementary school directly across the street. This building was Reagan Elementary, and it is now the current home of the school. Some are still held in the Parish hall, but most activities take place in the Reagan building. Plans exist to expand the Reagan building even more, for the school is quickly running out of room. Recently added was the new gym for the students located next to the Reagan building. It contains a band hall, gymnasium, and offices.

The group recorded two demo cassettes - \\"Pretention Is No Excuse\\" and \\"Hear No Evil...\\". The fledgling group disbanded in 1989 when Michael McKeegan joined Therapy?. Therapy? In 1989, while McKeegan was still at school, his classmate Fyfe Ewing handed him a four song cassette that he had recorded with Andy Cairns, entitled \\"Thirty Seconds Of Silence\\". McKeegan was so impressed he immediately joined as Therapy?'s bassist, and soon recorded his first material with the band; another four track demo tape entitled \\"Meat Abstract\\". He has since recorded fifteen studio albums, two compilation albums and numerous EPs. Along with Cairns, McKeegan is the only original member still with the band. Side Projects In the late 1990s, McKeegan joined the short-lived Belfast based group, Sons Of Massey, along with his brother Charlie McKeegan (drums), Robyn G. Shiels (vocals/guitar) and Paul Kinghan (guitar). The group played live around Northern Ireland and recorded a demo at Einstein Studios in County Antrim. In November 2014, McKeegan along with Andy Cairns recorded 15 tracks for a side project called East Antrim in Belfast's Start Studio with fellow Northern Irish musicians including Robyn G Shiels, Desert Hearts, Brian Coney, LaFaro and Goons. It's an electronic record, with a lot of spoken word and it deals in a very late night ambient sound. It remains unreleased.

Sir John Bell KCB ‚Äì Mezzotint ‚Äì Painted by John Lucas, engraved by Henry Cousins thumb Landing of van Riebeeck at the Cape of Good Hope, 1652 Cape Wagon Crossing a River Charles Davidson Bell FRSE (22 October 1813 ‚Äì 7 April 1882) was the Surveyor-General in the Cape Colony, an artist, heraldist, and designer of Cape medals and stamps. Life history Born on 22 October 1813 at Newhall, Crail, Fife, Scotland, he was educated locally at St Andrews University. Bell left Scotland and sailed to South Africa, landing at the Cape of Good Hope in 1830 and through his uncle Sir John Bell, Secretary to the Cape Government, was given a post in the civil service. He was appointed as expedition artist on Dr. Andrew Smith's two-year journey north as far as the Limpopo in 1834. He went from Acting Clerk of the Legislative Council in 1838, to Assistant Surveyor-General in 1843, to Surveyor-General in 1848. In 1851, he designed a silver gallantry medal for Cape governor Sir Harry Smith to present to troops during the 8th Frontier War. This is often referred to as the first South African medal. Appointed to the Postal Enquiry Board in 1852, he designed the well-known Cape of Good Hope triangular stamp, the first of that shape, which became extremely rare and consequently much sought after by philatelists. His design of rectangular stamps remained in use until 1902. Many of his sketches and paintings show a whimsical sense of humour, though his sensitive portrayals of the mixed population of Cape Town and of the tribes he encountered on the Smith expedition to the north, have become an invaluable record of life in 19th-century South Africa. The return of many of his paintings from England to South Africa in 1978, gave art historians a fresh appreciation of his work and greater insight into that period of Cape history. However, in his essay \\"Alcohol and Art\\", Russel Viljoen, professor in history at the University of South Africa wrote: Bell also made an important contribution to heraldry in South Africa. Throughout his residence at the Cape, he copied old Dutch/Afrikaner coats of arms from memorials, seals, stained glass windows, and other artefacts, and in 1861 he advertised his intention of publishing them in book form. The book did not see the light of day, but he later gave the manuscript, the drawings, and his notes to his brother-in-law Daniel Krynauw. Krynauw built up his own heraldry collection, and after his death, the two collections were placed in a Cape Town museum, from where they were transferred to the South African Library (now National Library of South Africa ‚Äì Cape Town Campus) in 1946. The material in the Bell-Krynauw Collection was eventually published in Cornelis Pama's Die Wapens van die Ou Afrikaanse Families (1959), and his later heraldry books. Bell designed the arms of the South African College (now University of Cape Town), and the \\"three anchors\\" badge of the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society (\\"Old Mutual\\"), of which he was chairman at one time. Both emblems are still in use, and may well be the oldest academic arms and corporate logo in South Africa. Bell was a founder member and chairman of the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society. He was awarded a gold medal in 1851 for his oil painting depicting the Landing of van Riebeeck at the Cape of Good Hope. A large number of his originals hang in the Library of Parliament in Cape Town, the University of the Witwatersrand and the Africana Museum in Johannesburg. The book Travels in the Interior of South Africa (1868) by James Chapman, was illustrated by Bell. His Reports of the Surveyor-General, Charles D. Bell Esq., on the copper fields of Little Namaqualand (1855) was written after a three-month visit to the area. He gave his name to the town of Bellville in the Cape, and Bell, a small village between Peddie and Hamburg, near the mouth of the Keiskamma River in the Eastern Cape. John Bell was a traveller and the eldest son of Charles Davidson Bell. Between 1861 and 1862 he accompanied Henry Samuel Chapman from Cape Town to Walvis Bay, through Hereroland to Lake Ngami and back to the Cape Colony via Shoshong, Kuruman and Hopetown. He was married to Margaret Roome in 1865 and died in 1878 in England. Charles Bell was a friend of Andrew Geddes Bain and was a pall-bearer at his funeral in 1864. After his retirement in 1872 he returned to Scotland in 1873 with Helena and their 3 surviving children, where Helena Bell died on 10 September 1881 and he died on 7 April 1882.

Plot summary The story opens as fifteen-year-old Cait recounts events occurring a year before on her small island home, Hale, which is roughly four miles long and two miles across at its greatest extent. She begins her story by explaining when she first met Lucas, a mysterious teenager who has traveled to the island to explore and live for a short time period. On the same day that she first sees Lucas, her brother returns home and she is nearly assaulted by another islander, Jamie Tait. However, Lucas is not accepted into the island community easily, due to the discrimination he receives at the hands of the town folk. He works a few odd jobs, but is the victim of attempted assault, forcing him to defend himself and earn a negative reputation. Primarily this comes from Jamie Tait, a university student and popular islander from a wealthy family. The negative behavior escalates when Lucas rescues a young girl from drowning during a town festival, but is met with accusations of molestation. Lucas is forced into hiding. However, he feels an urge to visit Cait one last time. Unfortunately, Jamie has decided to frame Lucas for the rape, assault and attempted murder of a promiscuous islander named Angel, who had befriended Bill, Cait's old best friend. The novel climaxes as the islanders attempt to capture Lucas, who is innocent of the crime. When islanders came to the McCann's house, knowing Lucas was there, Lucas was told to stay with Caitlyn in hiding as Dom and John (Cait's brother and father) went to talk to the villagers. Lucas and Caitlyn, however, can see what's happening through. When Lucas saw the villagers continued to protest and threaten the McCanns, Lucas decided to take the problem in his own hands. Lucas said goodbye to Caitlyn and told her to stay in place. Even though, Caitlyn protested, she obeyed. After a few talks with the islanders, Lucas turned around and looked at the hole where Caitlyn was peeking through and waved goodbye, and ran, the islanders chasing him. When Caitlyn saw this, she went out of hiding and ran as fast as she can just to get to Lucas. When Lucas got to the mudflats, which is very dangerous, since one wrong step can lead to death by sinking, he didn't stop while the villagers stayed in place. When Caitlyn got there she took the first step, but didn't get through all the way to Lucas, because Dom and John took a hold of her, because it was deadly, leaving Caitlyn thrashing around and shouting 'Lucas'. Lucas, however didn't responded and just stepped in one of the mudflats and sunk, leaving Caitlyn. Caitlyn, depressed, didn't talk as much and ate as much for days. People visited her like Simon and Bill, though she was still as glum and didn't mind them much. The police officer came and gave them Lucas' things and his notebook, he said that everything was clear because of it and Lucas' bad reputation was recovered. Characters Caitlyn 'Cait' McCann: Is the fifteen-year-old heroine of Lucas. Cait is a strong willed teenager, who feels alone on the island - her best friend is growing up in the wrong crowd and she does not want to be a part of their toxic behavior. Although she runs environmental charity stalls she is not as interested in that as she appears - she wants life to be simpler with the friends she used to have and that is why she is attracted to Lucas; he is a simple, untainted outsider who has a both pure and animalistic instinct setting him apart from everyone she knows. She tells the story a year after the events occurred because her father, a writer, told her to \\"cry herself a story\\", and understand what happened better. Lucas: The seventeen-year-old title character. Lucas tells Cait that his mother gave birth to him when she was young and Lucas had later left home for mysterious reasons, traveling from town to town. However, we never find out his full, true story and he remains a mysterious character which is part of his persona. He is a soft-spoken character with the potential for danger. Bill Grey: Bill is Cait's old best friend. Cait misses the 'old' Bill who used to enjoy trips to the library and looked at the world innocently. Their friendship falls apart when they begin to discover the world in different ways; whilst Cait tries to live her life quietly Bill craves attention and sex, alcohol and everything she believes will make her more 'grown-up' and in fact makes her more childish. Dominic \\"Dom\\" McCann: Dom is Cait's older brother who returns from university. At first he is involved in drugs and the island's party scene, but comes to his senses when he realizes how dangerous it is, via Cait. John McCann: John is Cait's father. He is an author of Young Adult fiction, is Irish and an alcoholic, due to the death of Cait's mother years before. He is in his early forties and supports Cait unconditionally. Jamie Tait: Jamie Tait is the son of a powerful man in town. Although he is engaged to the daughter of the police captain, he is a sexual predator who threatens Cait on multiple occasions. He is extremely prejudiced against Lucas and like all prejudices it stems from his fear of Lucas, the threat of Lucas being so attractive and such an unknown quantity. Angel Dean: Angel is the teen friend and sort-of mistress of Jamie, and Bill's \\"idol\\". She has a wild reputation for making bad choices and being promiscuous but underneath it all is just as lost, confused and lonely as Cait Simon: An unsure-of-self boy who works with Cait on projects. Simon has a crush on Cait and Dominic uses this to taunt Cait before Dominic changed. Reception Lucas has received numerous pieces of praise from a variety of different sources. The novel has been compared to To Kill a Mockingbird and The Ox-Bow Incident.http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/kevin-brooks Nicolette Jones of the Sunday Times praised Lucas, writing that \\"it gets to you. Then when this has happened, you want to tell everyone how good it is.\\" The book also won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis. Themes Kevin Brooks deals with a variety of different themes and main ideas in Lucas. Most notably, he expresses the theme of coming of age through Cait's narration. She changes a great deal throughout the novel and there are many references to her being both \\"an adult\\" and \\"a child,\\" referring to her changing personality. More than just coming of age though, Cait seems to develop a better self awareness. Other themes include how discrimination and distrust of strangers (xenophobia) can have drastically strong influences and that redemption is always possible for those who look for it. In addition, Brooks explores how just one person (both Jamie and Lucas) can have a massively large impact on small communities.

The village of Sokoleƒç lies completely inside the larger circuit. * small circuit 3.951-kilometre long with a maximum allowed speed of 90 km/h. * large circuit 13.276-kilometre long with a maximum allowed speed of 230 km/h for tilting trains and up to 210 km/h for conventional trains. The circuits allows the testing of the characteristics of vehicles, noise levels, the ability to communicate using the European Train Control System (ETCS) and GSM-R radio, and simulation of failures and changes in power system. Both circuits provide all railway electrification systems used in central Europe: * 3000 V (DC) * 1500 V (DC) * 25 kV AC railway electrification (50 Hz) * 15 kV AC railway electrification (16.7 Hz) In addition 1.5-kilometre length can be equipped for third rail supply for metro operators.

Synopsis While Ted is trying to fix the plumbing in the Craggy Island parochial house, he receives news that the nearby Holy Stone of Clonrichert is being upgraded to a \\"class two relic\\" by the Vatican. Three bishops are being sent to perform the ceremony and will be staying in the parochial house, and Ted realises he needs to have both Dougal and Jack on their \\"best behaviour\\". Ted tells Dougal to keep to matters about the Church, while he trains Jack, with the promise of a drink, to speak simple replies to answer any question he may be asked, specifically \\"yes\\", and \\"that would be an ecumenical matter\\". Bishops O'Neill, Facks, and Jordan arrive, and with Ted, Dougal, and Jack, they perform the ceremony without incident, and then they congregate into pairs. Dougal speaks with O'Neill, expressing his doubts about organised religion and the Catholic Church. Facks is enthusiastically impressed with Jack's \\"views\\" on the Church, and starts jabbing Jack with his finger to express his excitement, leading Jack to stuff the Holy Stone up Facks' rear end. At the parochial house, Ted excuses himself from Jordan to use the restroom, but as the plumbing is not yet fixed, Ted's flushes causes the water to erupt out over a drain in the yard that Jordan happens to be standing over. The elderly bishop has a heart attack and dies. Later, Ted and Dougal watch the three bishops leave: O'Neill has taken to Dougal's words and has left the Church to become a hippie (asking that Dougal now call him \\"Eddie\\"), Facks is escorted in an ambulance to have the Holy Stone removed, and a hearse drives away with Jordan's casket. When all have gone, Ted reflects on the visit, remarking that it went rather well.

His latest endeavor, The Grail Project was an effort to develop a \\"new approach for digital content delivery.\\" Education Magnussen graduated from the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business in 1995. During his time as an undergraduate at USC, he developed an award-winning business plan for a class project that would eventually grow to become Zentropy Partners, according to the Los Angeles Business Journal. Business ventures Magnussen formed Zentropy Partners, an interactive advertising and branding company, in 1995 just prior to the dot-com boom. Under his leadership, the fledgling company hit $80 million in annual revenue in three years. Global advertising conglomerate Interpublic Group acquired Zentropy in 1999 for $50 million. In 2001, Zentropy was folded into the MRM Worldwide division of McCann-Erickson. In 2002, Magnussen founded Ripe Digital Entertainment, a media company that developed video-on-demand television networks for cable, the Internet, and wireless devices.

The title has been variously translated as Kinship of the Three, Akinness of the Three, Triplex Unity, The Seal of the Unity of the Three, and in several other ways. The full title of the text is Zhouyi cantong qi, which can be translated as, for example, The Kinship of the Three, in Accordance with the Book of Changes. According to the traditional view, well-established in China, the text was composed by Wei Boyang in the mid-second century CE, and deals entirely with alchemy‚Äîin particular, with Neidan, or Internal Alchemy. Besides this one, there has been, within the Taoist tradition, a second way of reading the text: in agreement with its title, the Cantong qi is concerned not with one, but with three major subjects, namely Cosmology (the system of the Book of Changes), Taoism (the way of \\"non-doing\\"), and Alchemy, and joins them to one another into a single doctrine. Authorship For about a millennium, the authorship of the Cantong qi has been attributed to Wei Boyang, who was said to have been a southern alchemist from the Shangyu district of Kuaiji in the region of Jiangnan, corresponding to Fenghui () in present-day Shangyu, about east of Hangzhou. The best-known account of Wei Boyang is found in the Shenxian zhuan (Biographies of the Divine Immortals), a work attributed to Ge Hong (283-343). According to this record (trans. Campany, 2002:368-69), Wei Boyang was the son of a high-ranking family. He and three disciples retired to a mountain and compounded an elixir. When they tested it on a dog, the dog died. Despite this, Wei Boyang and one of his disciples decided to ingest the compound, and they also died. After the two other disciples had left, Wei Boyang came to life again. He poured some of the elixir into the mouths of the dead disciple and the dog, and they also revived. Thus Wei Boyang and his faithful disciple attained immortality. With an abrupt change in tone and language, the account ends with a final paragraph, which mentions Wei Boyang‚Äôs authorship of the Cantong qi and of another work entitled The Five Categories (Wu xianglei ‰∫îÁõ∏È°û), criticizing at the same time those who read the Cantong qi as a work concerned with cosmology instead of alchemy.Taiping guangji Â§™Âπ≥Âª£Ë®ò (Extended Collection of Records of the Taiping xingguo Reign Period), chapter 2. Several centuries later, Peng Xiao (?-955) gives a different portrait of Wei Boyang in his commentary, dating from 947 CE (trans. Pregadio, 2011:264-65). With Peng Xiao, Wei Boyang becomes a learned master who is competent in prose and poetry, is versed in the esoteric texts, cultivates the Dao ‚Äúin secret and silence,‚Äù and nourishes himself ‚Äúin Empty Non-being.‚Äù At the end of his account, moreover, Peng Xiao gives further details on the early history of the text, saying: Elsewhere in his work, moreover, Peng Xiao reveals a different view on the authorship of the Cantong qi: While Wei Boyang was a southern alchemist, Xu Congshi and Chunyu Shutong were representatives of the cosmological traditions of northern China. Xu was a native of Qingzhou, in the present-day region of Shandong. His disciple, Chunyu, was a \\"master of the methods\\" (fangshi) specialized in cosmology, prognostication, and the related sciences. (See Pregadio, 2011:7-9.) Sources prior to Peng Xiao show that Xu Congshi and Chunyu Shutong were originally believed to be the main authors of the Cantong qi.See Riyue xuanshu lun Êó•ÊúàÁéÑÊ®ûË´ñ (Essay on the Mysterious Pivot of the Sun and the Moon), in Daoshu ÈÅìÊ®û (Pivot of the Dao), chapter 26; and the prefaces to the two Tang-dynasty commentaries to the Cantong qi, i.e., the Zhouyi cantong qi zhu Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëÊ≥® (anonymous) and the Zhouyi cantong qi (attributed to Yin Changsheng Èô∞Èï∑Áîü). To give one example, an anonymous commentary to the Cantong qi, dating from ca. 700, is explicit about the roles played by Xu Congshi, Chunyu Shutong, and Wei Boyang in the creation of the text, saying: Elsewhere, the same commentary ascribes the Cantong qi to Xu Congshi alone. For example, the notes on the verse, ‚ÄúHe contemplates on high the manifest signs of Heaven‚Äù („Äå‰∏äËßÄÈ°ØÂ§©Á¨¶„Äç), state: ‚ÄúThe True Man Xu Congshi looked above and contemplated the images of the trigrams; thus he determined Yin and Yang.‚ÄùZhouyi cantong qi zhu, chapter 1. The passages quoted above reflect contrasting views on the authorship of the Cantong qi, between those who maintained that the text pertained in the first place to the northern cosmological traditions, and those who saw it as a product of the southern alchemical traditions. Taking this point into account, Pregadio (2011:23-25) has suggested that the final paragraph in the Shenxian zhuan's account may have been added at a later time to further the second view. With the possible exception of Ge Hong, the first author known to have attributed the composition of the whole Cantong qi to Wei Boyang is Liu Zhigu ÂäâÁü•Âè§, a Taoist priest and alchemical practitioner who was received at court by Emperor Xuanzong around 750 CE.Riyue xuanshu lun, in Daoshu, chapter 26. Two centuries later, another alchemist, Peng Xiao, cites and praises Liu Zhigu‚Äôs discussion, and becomes the first major author to promote the same view. With the development of the Neidan traditions, this view became established. Since then, there has been virtually unanimous consent that the Cantong qi was not only transmitted, but also entirely composed, within the context of the alchemical tradition. Date The view that the Cantong qi is entirely concerned with alchemy and was entirely composed by Wei Boyang in the second century CE is virtually impervious to historical analysis. The view that the Cantong qi is concerned with three related subjects, instead, leaves more room to inquiries into the dates of the respective textual portions. (1) Cosmology. The cosmological views of the Cantong qi are rooted in the system of the Yijing, or Book of Changes. Moreover, commentators (e.g. Peng Xiao and Zhu Xi) and scholars (e.g. Yang Xiaolei 1993:552-53; Meng Naichang 1993:30 ff., 85 ff.) have suggested that the Cantong qi is also related to the so-called \\"apocrypha\\" (weishu Á∑ØÊõ∏), a Han-dynasty corpus of cosmological and divinatory texts that is now almost entirely lost. While this relation has often been taken as evidence of a Han date of the Cantong qi, other scholars (e.g., Fukui 1974:27-31) have suggested that a work entitled Cantong qi may have existed during the Han period, but if it did exist, it was not the same as the present-day text. One further point deserving attention in this context is the fact that two passages of the Cantong qi are similar to passages found in the Yijing commentary written by Yu Fan (164-233), a major representative of the cosmological tradition. Suzuki Yoshijir≈ç (1977:602-3) suggested that Yu Fan drew on the Cantong qi for his commentary on the Yijing. Pregadio (2011:16-17) has suggested, vice versa, that the Cantong qi presents a poetical rendition of Yu Fan‚Äôs passages. If this suggestion is correct, the cosmological portions of the Cantong qi were composed, or at least were completed, after the end of the Han period.Yu Fan‚Äôs passage is preserved with other fragments of his lost Yijing commentary in Li Dingzuo‚Äôs ÊùéÈºéÁ•ö (Tang, dates unknown) Zhouyi jijie Âë®ÊòìÈõÜËß£ (Collected Explications of the Book of Changes), chapter 14. (2) Alchemy. Among the large number of Chinese scholars who have expressed their views about the date of the Cantong qi, the opinions of Chen Guofu (who was for several decades the main Chinese expert in this field) are especially worthy of attention. As he pointed out, no extant alchemical work dating from the Han period is based on the doctrinal principles of the Cantong qi, or uses its cosmological model and its language (Chen Guofu, 1983:352-54). Pregadio's views are even more radical in this regard: \\"First, neither the Cantong qi nor its cosmological and alchemical models play any visible influence on extant Waidan texts dating not only from the Han period, but also from the whole Six Dynasties (i.e., until the sixth century inclusive). . . . Second, the same can be said with even more confidence about Neidan, since no text belonging to this branch of Chinese alchemy has existed‚Äîor has left traces of its existence‚Äîuntil the eighth century\\" (Pregadio, 2011:19-20). The earliest explicit mention of the Cantong qi in relation to alchemy was pointed out by Arthur Waley in the early 1930s. It is found in a piece by the poet Jiang Yan (444-505), who mentions the Cantong qi in a poem devoted to an immortal named Qin Gao. The relevant lines of the poem read, in Arthur Waley‚Äôs translation (1930-32:8): (3) Taoism. The \\"Taoist\\" portions of the Cantong qi make a distinction between the paths of \\"superior virtue\\" (shangde) and \\"inferior virtue\\" (xiade)‚Äîi.e., the paths of non-doing (wuwei) and of alchemy. This distinction is drawn from the perspective of the former path, and conforms to principles set forth in the Daode jing and elaborated on in the Zhuangzi. If this point is taken into account, it appears evident that those who gave the Cantong qi its present shape could only be the nameless representatives of the Taoist traditions of Jiangnan, who had essential ties to the doctrines of the Daode jing and the Zhuangzi. Moreover, as it has been pointed out (Pregadio 2011:26-27), the Taoist portions of the Cantong qi contain passages that criticize the Taoist methods of meditation on the inner deities. Despite this, the Cantong qi draws some of its terminology from texts pertaining to Taoist meditation, and in particular from the \\"Inner‚Äù version of the Scripture of the Yellow Court (Huangting jing), a work belonging to the Shangqing revelations of 364-70. Since the shared terms are evenly distributed among the different parts of the Cantong qi, it seems clear that an anonymous \\"hand\\"‚Äîthe collective hand of the southern Taoist traditions‚Äîrevised the text, probably after the end of the fourth century. On the basis of the above evidence, Pregadio (2001:27) concludes that \\"the Cantong qi was composed in different stages, perhaps from the Han period onward, and did not reach a form substantially similar to the present one before ca. 450, and possibly one or even two centuries later.\\" Composition In most redactions, the Cantong qi is divided into 3 parts. Parts 1 and 2 contain the main text. With the exception of a few short passages in prose, they are written in 4- or 5-character verses (the 5-character verses prevail in the first part, while the second part is almost entirely made of 4-character verses). Several poems written in either meter mirror one another in subject matter and vocabulary. Part 3 is made of several additional compositions: (1) An \\"Epilogue\\" (\\"Luanci\\" ‰∫ÇËæ≠), mostly written according to the saoti È®∑È´î prosody, so called after the Lisao (Encountering Sorrow) piece in the Songs of Chu (Chuci). (2) The \\"Song of the Tripod\\" (\\"Dingqi ge\\" ÈºéÂô®Ê≠å), a poem in three-character verses, another prosodic form not found in the first two parts. (3) A final section‚Äîentitled in different ways by different commentators‚Äîstating that the teachings of the Cantong qi are based on the Book of Changes, Taoism, and alchemy, and containing a final poem in which the author describes himself and his work. In some redactions, moreover, the third part is concluded by an anonymous postface entitled \\"Eulogium\\" (\\"Zanxu\\" ËÆöÂ∫è). The \\"Ancient Text\\" In the early sixteenth century, a new version of the Cantong qi, anachronistically called Guwen cantong qi Âè§ÊñáÂèÉÂêåÂ•ë, or Ancient Text of the Cantong qi, was created on the basis of a complete rearrangement of the scripture. This version divides the sections in verses of 4 characters from those in verses of 5 characters, following a suggestion that was first given by Yu Yan in his commentary of 1284. Yu Yan refers to this as a sudden realization that he had after he finished to write his work: The origins of the Ancient Text can be traced back to Du Yicheng Êùú‰∏ÄË™†, who came from Suzhou (like Yu Yan) and wrote a now-lost commentary on it in 1517. About three decades later, the famous literatus, Yang Shen (1488‚Äì1559), claimed to have found the work in a stone casket, and published it under his own name. Since then, the Ancient Text has been mainly associated with Yang Shen. Several authors of commentaries to the standard version of the Cantong qi have regarded the Ancient Text as spurious, and similar criticism has also been voiced by Chinese scholars from the Qing period onward. This view has been partly influenced by the controversial personality of Yang Shen, who was known to have falsified early Chinese works (Schorr 1993). Whether the verdict of \\"non-authenticity\\" is or is not accurate, it should be considered that the Ancient Text, despite the different arrangement, includes the whole Cantong qi, without any addition and with the omission of only a few verses; and that no one without a solid knowledge of the standard version of the Cantong qi, and of its doctrinal principles, could have fabricated a work of this nature. In the arrangement of the Ancient Text, the 4- and 5-character verses are not reproduced in the same sequence as in the standard version; and in the new arrangement, the discourse of Cantong qi reveals a much clearer pattern. The Ancient Text gives prominence not only to the three main subjects of the Cantong qi, but also to the three authors traditionally considered to be involved in its composition. This is likely to be the main reason why several commentators, for whom Wei Boyang could only be the single author of the whole Cantong qi, and Internal Alchemy its single subject, rejected the Ancient Text altogether. According to the new version, Wei Boyang wrote the portion entitled \\"Canon\\" (\\"Jing\\") in verses of 4 characters; Xu Congshi‚Äîwhom the Ancient Text exegetes regularly identify as Xu Jingxiu ÂæêÊôØ‰ºë, as also did Yu YanZhouyi cantong qi fahui, chapter 9.‚Äîcontributed a \\"Commentary\\" (\\"Zhu\\" Ê≥®) in verses of 5 characters; and Chunyu Shutong added a final section, entitled \\"The Three Categories\\" (\\"San xianglei\\" ‰∏âÁõ∏È°û). In the Ancient Text, both the \\"Canon\\" and the \\"Commentary\\" are divided into three chapters, respectively devoted to cosmology, Taoism, and alchemy. Cosmology Qian, Kun, Kan, Li. The main cosmological emblems in the Cantong qi are Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Although these names belong to the vocabulary of the Book of Changes, in the Cantong qi they denote formless principles that serve to explicate how the Dao generates the world and manifests itself in it. The corresponding trigrams (Qian ‚ò∞, Kun ‚ò∑, Kan ‚òµ, Li ‚ò≤) and hexagrams (Qian ‰∑Ä, Kun ‰∑Å, Kan ‰∑ú, Li ‰∑ù) are symbolic forms used to represent those principles. Qian is the active (\\"creative\\") principle, essence, Yang, and Heaven; Kun is the passive (\\"receptive\\") principle, substance, Yin, and Earth. Being permanently joined to one another in the precosmic domain, Qian entrusts its creative power to Kun, and Kun brings creation to accomplishment. In the everlasting instant in which Qian and Kun give birth to the cosmos, the Yang of Qian moves into Kun, and, in response, the Yin of Kun moves into Qian. In the symbolic representation by the corresponding trigrams, Qian ‚ò∞ entrusts its essence to Kun and becomes Li ‚ò≤; Kun ‚ò∑ receives the essence of Qian and becomes Kan ‚òµ. Kan and Li, therefore, replace Qian and Kun in the cosmic domain. Since they harbor the Yang of Qian and the Yin of Kun, respectively, as their own inner essences, they enable the Yin and Yang of the precosmic domain to operate in the cosmic domain. The main images of Qian and Kun are Heaven and Earth, which are immutably joined to one another. The main images of Kan and Li are the Moon and the Sun, which alternate in their growth and decline during the longer or shorter time cycles. Five agents. The five agents (wuxing) are Wood, Fire, Soil, Metal, and Water. They are generated in the first place by the division of original Unity into Yin and Yang, and by the further subdivision of Yin and Yang into four states. In the Cantong qi, Water and Fire are the Yin and Yang of the postcelestial state, and Wood and Metal are True Yin and True Yang of the precelestial state. Soil, the fifth agent, has both a Yang and a Yin aspect. Being at the center, it stands for the source from which the other four agents derive. Time Cycles. The cosmological portions of the Cantong qi give emphasis to three emblematic time cycles: the day, the month, and the year. These cycles manifest the presence of the One Breath (yiqi ‰∏ÄÊ∞£) of the Dao in the cosmos. All of them became models of the \\"fire times\\" (huohou ÁÅ´ÂÄô) in alchemy, which determine the process needed to heat the Elixir. Taoism \\"Superior Virtue\\", \\"Inferior Virtue\\". A passage of the Cantong qi states: These verses are directly based on a passage of the Daode jing (sec. 38): > ‰∏äÂæ∑‰∏çÂæ∑ÔºåÊòØ‰ª•ÊúâÂæ∑Ôºõ‰∏ãÂæ∑‰∏çÂ§±Âæ∑ÔºåÊòØ‰ª•ÁÑ°Âæ∑„ÄÇ In both the Daode jing and the Cantong qi, the subject of these verses is the distinction between non-doing (wuwei) and doing (youwei), referred to as the ways of \\"superior virtue\\" (shangde ‰∏äÂæ∑) and \\"inferior virtue\\" (xiade ‰∏ãÂæ∑), respectively. In the way of \\"superior virtue\\", the state prior to the separation of the One into the two is spontaneously attained. The distinction between \\"one\\" and \\"two\\" does not even arise, and the unity of the precelestial and the postcelestial domains is immediately realized. There is no need to seek the One Breath, and therefore no support is necessary to find it. This is the way of the True Man (zhenren). \\"Inferior virtue\\", instead, focuses on seeking; its unceasing search of the One Breath needs supports, and the postcelestial domain is \\"used\\" to find the precelestial state hidden within it. This is the way of alchemy. Performing a practice‚Äîeither \\"internal\\" or \\"external\\"‚Äîis a form of \\"doing\\": the alchemical process is conducted in order to attain the realized state. Its purpose is to prepare one to enter the state of \\"non doing,\\" and is fulfilled only when this happens. This process‚Äîwhich is gradual, and differs in this respect from immediate realization, the prerogative of \\"superior virtue\\"‚Äîis at the core of alchemy, in all of its forms. Criticism of Other Practices. The Cantong qi devotes much attention to practices deemed to be inadequate for true realization. These practices are of two kinds. The first consists of non-alchemical practices, including breathing, meditation on the inner gods, sexual practices, and worship of spirits and minor deities: This \\"treading the Dipper and pacing the asterisms\\" refers to yubu and bugang. All these practices and methods were current during the Later Han period and the Six Dynasties (1st-6th centuries CE). The second kind of criticism is addressed to alchemical practices that are not based on the principle of \\"being of the same kind\\" (or \\"category,\\" tonglei ÂêåÈ°û). Only Lead and Mercury, according to the Cantong qi, are of the \\"same kind\\" as Qian and Kun, and can represent and enable their conjunction. Alchemy The alchemical discourse of the Cantong qi revolves around Lead and Mercury. Its basic principles proceed directly from its views on the relation between the Dao and the \\"ten thousand things\\" (i.e., multiplicity and change). As in the whole of Taoism, this relation is explained by means of a sequence of stages. The absolute principle (Dao) establishes itself as Unity (Yi ‰∏Ä), which divides itself into the active and the passive principles‚Äînamely, Qian and Kun, respectively equivalent to original Yang and Yin, or True Yang and True Yin. The re-conjunction of these principles gives birth to all entities and phenomena in the world. All these \\"stages\\" occur simultaneously. The alchemical process consists in tracing the stages of this process in a reverse sequence, in order to recover the hidden One Breath and return to it. In alchemical language, True Lead (‚ò∞) and True Mercury (‚ò∑) respectively represent True Yang and True Yin. The Yin and Yang entities that respectively contain these authentic principles are represented by \\"black lead\\" (i.e., native lead ‚òµ) and cinnabar (‚ò≤). In the strict sense of the term, alchemy consists in extracting True Lead from \\"black lead\\" and True Mercury from cinnabar, and in joining them to one another. When the five agents (wuxing) are used to represent the alchemical process, the basic configuration is the same. \\"Black lead\\" and cinnabar are Water and Fire, and True Lead and True Mercury are Metal and Wood. In the alchemical process, where the \\"generation sequence\\" of the agents is inverted, Water (\\"black lead\\") generates Metal (True Lead), and Fire (cinnabar) generates Wood (True Mercury). Soil, the fifth agent, allows the entire alchemical process to unfold, and also represent its completion. Positioned at the center of the other agents, it is emblematic of Unity containing True Yin and True Yang. Being found within both ingredients of the Elixir, Soil stands for their fundamental unity, and enables them to conjoin. Commentaries With the exception of the Daode jing and the Zhuangzi, few Taoist texts have enjoyed an exegetical tradition as voluminous and diversified as the Cantong qi. More than three dozen traditional commentaries are extant, written between ca. 700 and the final years of the Qing dynasty (Pregadio 2012:21-76). Different sources‚Äîin particular, bibliographies and premodern library catalogues‚Äîyield information on about twice as many lost commentaries and closely related works (Pregadio 2012:91-102). The Taoist Canon (Daozang) of 1445 contains the following commentaries to the standard text: # Zhouyi cantong qi zhu Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëÊ≥® (Commentary to the Cantong qi). Anonymous, dating from ca. 700, containing the only surviving explication of the Cantong qi as a work concerned with Waidan. Only the portion corresponding to part 1 is extant. # Zhouyi cantong qi. Attributed to a venerable Taoist immortal, Yin Changsheng Èô∞Èï∑Áîü, also dating from ca. 700. # Zhouyi cantong qi fenzhang tong zhenyi Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëÂàÜÁ´†ÈÄöÁúüÁæ© (True Meaning of the Cantong qi, with a Subdivision into Sections). Peng Xiao ÂΩ≠Êõâ (?-955), dating from 947. # Zhouyi cantong qi kaoyi Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëËÄÉÁï∞ (Investigation of Discrepancies in the Cantong qi). Zhu Xi Êú±ÁÜπ (1130-1200), dating from 1197. # Zhouyi cantong qi. Chu Yong ÂÑ≤Ê≥≥ (also known as Chu Huagu ÂÑ≤ËèØË∞∑, fl. ca. 1230), dating from ca. 1230. # Zhouyi cantong qi jie Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëËß£ (Explication of the Cantong qi). Chen Xianwei Èô≥È°ØÂæÆ (?-after 1254), dating from 1234. # Zhouyi cantong qi fahui Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëÁôºÊèÆ (Elucidation of the Cantong qi). Yu Yan ‰øûÁê∞ (1258-1314), dating from 1284. # Zhouyi cantong qi zhu Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëÊ≥® (Commentary to the Cantong qi). Anonymous Neidan commentary, dating from after 1208. The first two commentaries present a somewhat unrefined state of the text, not divided into sections, with several sentences not yet normalized into 4- or 5-character verses, and‚Äîa significant detail‚Äîwith more explicit allusions to Waidan compared to the later redactions (where certain sentences appear in slightly modified forms). In the mid-tenth century, Peng Xiao revised the text and produced the version that is, directly or indirectly, at the basis of most later commentaries. His work, which is divided into 90 sections, has not reached us in its original form; there is clear evidence that it was altered in the early thirteenth century with the incorporation of several dozen readings drawn from Zhu Xi‚Äôs text (Pregadio 2012:120-25). The revised version of Peng Xiao‚Äôs text is faithfully followed by the anonymous Neidan commentary. The first text to be based on a comparison of earlier editions was established by Zhu Xi, but his work was deprived of most of its critical notes by the mid-fourteenth century (Pregadio: 137-45). Zhu Xi‚Äôs text in turn served as a model to Chu Yong. The two remaining commentaries in the Taoist Canon are those by Chen Xianwei, whose text derives from Peng Xiao; and by Yu Yan, who based his work on Zhu Xi‚Äôs text. Yu Yan‚Äôs learned commentary contains quotations from about one hundred different texts, and is accompanied by philological notes on variants found in earlier editions. The Neidan commentary by Chen Zhixu Èô≥Ëá¥Ëôõ (1290-ca. 1368) is entitled Zhouyi cantong qi zhujie Âë®ÊòìÂèÉÂêåÂ•ëÊ≥®Ëß£ (Commentary and Explication of the Cantong qi) and dates from ca. 1330. His text is ultimately based on Peng Xiao‚Äôs redaction, but contains about four dozen readings that are not documented in earlier extant works (Pregadio 2012:148-56). With the exception of Zhu Xi‚Äôs work, all extant commentaries to the Cantong qi written through the Yuan period (1279-1368) are related to the Taoist alchemical traditions. During the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and the Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, the Cantong qi continued to exert its prestige on Neidan, but its influence also extended to other fields. Zhu Xi‚Äôs commentary, in particular, inspired many literati to read the text and write about it. The commentaries by Xu Wei ÂæêÊ∏≠ (ca. 1570) and Wang Wenlu ÁéãÊñáÁ•ø (1582) during the Ming period, and those by Li Guangdi ÊùéÂÖâÂú∞ (ca. 1700), Wang Fu Ê±™Á¥± (ca. 1750), and Li Shixu Èªé‰∏ñÂ∫è (1823) during the Qing period, are representative of this trend. The redaction by Chen Zhixu was, either on its own or in a substantial way, at the basis of the commentaries by Xu Wei, Wang Wenlu, Li Guangdi, and Wang Fu, as well as those by Zhang Wenlong ÂºµÊñáÈæç (1566), Zhen Shu ÁîÑÊ∑ë (1636), and Dong Dening Ëë£Âæ∑ÂØß (1787). Other commentators, including Lu Xixing Èô∏Ë•øÊòü (1569, revised in 1573) and Zhu Yuanyu Êú±ÂÖÉËÇ≤ (1669), based their texts on other redactions. Ten commentaries to the Ancient Text version of the Cantong qi are extant, including those by Wang Jiachun ÁéãÂÆ∂Êò• (1591?), Peng Haogu ÂΩ≠Â•ΩÂè§ (1599), Qiu Zhao‚Äôao ‰ªáÂÖÜÈ∞≤ (1704), and Liu Yiming Âäâ‰∏ÄÊòé (1799), whose authors were affiliated with different Ming and Qing lineages of Neidan (Pregadio 2012:185-97). Translations In 1932, Wu Lu-Ch'iang and Tenney L. Davis first translated the Cantong qi. A hard-to-find translation was published by the Chinese scholar, Zhou Shiyi, in 1988. In 1994, Richard Bertschinger translated the Guwen cantong qi, i.e., the 16th-century \\"Ancient Text\\" version. A new annotated translation of the standard text was published by Fabrizio Pregadio in 2011. Several passages of the text are also translated and discussed in works by Joseph Needham (1976: 50-75), Ho Peng Yoke (1972), and Nathan Sivin (1980).

Design and development The basic design of the Blackburn Dart was developed into a two-seater to meet a Greek Navy requirement for a coastal defence seaplane. The aircraft became the T.3 Velos, a twin-float seaplane. The Velos differed from the standard Dart T.2 in having a two-seat cockpit with a rear-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun, an increased weapons load with four 230 lb (104 kg) bombs mounted under the wings and provisions to fly as either a seaplane with floats or with a conventional undercarriage. In 1925, a small batch of four aircraft was built at Brough Aerodrome for the Greek Navy. Later in the same year, the aircraft was chosen to be the first licence-built aircraft in Greece, in a factory built by Blackburn and operated under a five-year contract. The Aircraft Factory, later renamed the State Aircraft Factory or Greek National Aircraft Factory, operated in Palaion Faliro to produce 12 Greek-built T.3A Velos aircraft with a raised rear cockpit to give an improved field of fire for the observer and a larger radiator. The first of the production order flew in March 1926. Blackburn produced two additional T.3 models as the T.3A Velos, initially for trials of the company's new metal floats and later, one example embarked on a demonstration and sales tour of South America in 1927. Despite the sales tour, the T.3A garnered no orders. Both T.3As were converted to seaplane trainers and joined four other production aircraft built for the Blackburn Reserve School (North Sea Aerial and General Transport Co. Ltd) to replace the company's Dart seaplane trainers for providing advanced training. After 1929, all of the T.3As were converted back into landplanes and continued in service until replacement by Ripons and Baffins in 1933. Operational service The Blackburn T.3 Velos not only fulfilled an operational role as a coastal defence/torpedo bomber in the Naval Air Component Squadrons in Greece, but also helped establish an indigenous aviation industry. The aircraft began operations in 1926 with the Greek Navy deployed at Tatoi Aerodrome and Phaleron Bay, Athens. During operations, the T.3s delivered steady if not spectacular service. The Velos remained in squadron use until 1934 with all examples retired by 1936.

Born and educated in Edinburgh, he spent most of his early career in India, where he made a study of the local languages. In later life, he returned to Britain and lived in Edinburgh and London. In his final years, he moved to Paris, where he died at the age of 81. He is principally known for his study of the Hindustani language, which led to it being adopted as the lingua franca off northern India (including present- day Pakistan) by British colonists and indigenous people. He compiled and authored An English-Hindustani Dictionary, A Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language, The Oriental Linguist, and many more. His lexicon of Hindustani was published in Arabic script, NƒÅgarƒ´ script, and in Roman transliteration. He is also known for his role in the foundation of University College London and for endowing the Gilchrist Educational Trust. Biography=Early life and education Gilchrist was born on 19 June 1759 in Edinburgh, and baptised on 22 June 1759 with the names John Hay Gilchrist.19/06/1759 GILCHRIST, JOHN HAY (Church registers Old Parish Registers Records 685/1 300 78) Page 78 of 325 His father was Walter Gilchrist, but very little is known about him except that he was a merchant who disappeared the year that John was born. His mother was Henrietta Farquharson (1730-1830), originally from Dundee, who lived to the very advanced age of 100. In later life, Gilchrist obtained a licence to use the name Borthwick, his maternal grandmother's surname, based on her descendancy from the Borthwick title in the Scottish peerage.House of Lords 7 HLC 124 July 1, 8, l2 13, 16, 1858 Walter G. Whicker - Appellant; Joseph Hume and others, - Respondents http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs3/11ER50.html He was educated at George Heriot's School and the Edinburgh High School (1773‚Äì1775). At the age of 16, he travelled to the West Indies, where he gained a knowledge of the cultivation and production of indigo. He remained there for two or three years before returning to Edinburgh. Career in India In 1782, Gilchrist was apprenticed as a surgeon's mate in the Royal Navy and travelled to Bombay, India. There, he joined the East India Company's Medical Service and was appointed assistant surgeon in 1784. He marched with the company's Bengal Army to Fatehgarh, and during this journey he noted the extent to which the Hindustani language could be understood in different parts of the country. However, he was surprised that the company neither required nor encouraged their employees to learn it, and subsequent experiences convinced him that officers in the army should also learn it in order to communicate effectively with the Indian soldiers or sepoys. =Hindustani dictionary= Gilchrist began a systematic study of Hindustani, and from this work he created his first dictionary. In 1785 he requested a year's leave from duty to continue these studies. This leave was eventually granted in 1787 and Gilchrist never returned to the Medical Service. He spent 12 years living at various places, including Patna, Faizabad, Lucknow, Delhi, and Ghazipur. He travelled extensively to work with native speakers and also to garner material. In Ghazipur, to help finance his work, he also engaged in the production of indigo, sugar and opium ‚Äì an enterprise which was initially successful but eventually failed. In 1786, he advertised his first publication, A Dictionary: English and Hindoostanee. To which Is Prefixed a Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language. This was published by subscription and issued in instalments to be completed in 1790. It was the first printed publication in Devanagari type, as developed by the Orientalist and typographer, Charles Wilkins. The Government promised to take 150 sets at 40 rupees each, and the price rose eventually to 60 rupees. =Background to the Hindustani language= In Northern India, the Hindustani language developed from the need of the new migrants of Persian and Turkish origin to communicate with people in Delhi and the surrounding regions. The local populace spoke Dehlavi dialect, one of the Hindi languages, which supplied the basic vocabulary and grammar but also absorbed a lot of words from Persian to form Hindustani. Gilchrist popularized Hindustani as the language of British administration. When he started as a surgeon with the East India Company's payroll, he was told that Persian was India's main language, but he quickly discovered that none of the people he met spoke either Persian or Arabic very well. His interactions with people helped him to discover that Hindustani was already known to some in the East India Company. They referred to the language as Moors language or simply Jargon, and it was Gilchrist who adopted this as the new language of administration for British India. =Fort William College= On Gilchrist's suggestion, the Governor-General, the Marquess of Wellesley, and the East India Company decided to set up a training institution for its recruits in Calcutta. This started as the Oriental Seminary or Gilchrist ka madrasa, but was enlarged within a year to become Fort William College in 1800. Gilchrist served as the first principal of the college until 1804, and through the personal patronage of Wellesley received a generous salary of 1500 rupees a month, or about ¬£1800 per year (about ¬£180,000 in present-day terms). During this time, he also published a number of books: The Stranger's East India Guide to the Hindoostanee or Grand Popular Language of India, The Hindustani Manual or Casket of India, Nastaliq-e- Hindoe, The Hindu Roman Orthoeptical Ultimatum, The Oriental Fabulist, and others. Under Gilchrist's leadership, Fort William also became a centre for Urdu prose. The language they taught was meant for young British people to acquire a general practical knowledge for administrative purposes, and not for native speakers of the language. He gathered around him writers from all over India who were able to produce a simple Urdu style that was \\"intelligible to British officers and merchants who had no use for poetry\\". One of Gilchrist's pupils was the missionary Henry Martyn, an Anglican priest and chaplain for the East India Company, who revised the Hindustani version of the New Testament and later translated it, together with the Book of Psalms and Book of Common Prayer, into Urdu and Persian. By the early nineteenth century, the Persian language was gradually replaced by Urdu as the vernacular to serve as the administrative language in a growing colonial bureaucracy. In 1803, Gilchrist inducted other writers into the college, who helped make rapid strides in Hindi language and literature. Subsequently, a Hindi translation of the Bible appeared in 1818 and Udant Martand, the first Hindi newspaper, was published in 1826 in Calcutta. Scholars debate Gilchrist's role in the distillation of Hindustani into the modern languages of Hindi and Urdu, but according to Gilchrist, the rise of the new prose tradition was also the \\"bifurcation of Khariboli into two forms ‚Äì the Hindustani language with Khariboli as the root resulted in two languages (Hindi and Urdu), each with its own character and script.\\" He not only discovered/invented the Hindustani language, but he was credited as a great patron of Urdu and indirectly the reinvigoration of Hindi. During his time at Fort William College, he encouraged the use of the purer form of Khariboli from which contemporary Hindi evolved. In the words of K.B. Jindal, author of A history of Hindi literature: \\"Hindi as we know it today is the product of the nineteenth century.\\" Another view was that of George Abraham Grierson, an Irish linguist and Civil servant, who said that the standard or pure Hindi which contemporary Indians use is \\"an artificial dialect the mother tongue of no native-born Indian, a newly invented speech, that wonderful hybrid known to Europeans as Hindi and invented by them.\\" Land in Australia In 1801, while still in India, Gilchrist acquired a substantial holding of land near Sydney, Australia, from William Balmain. He bought this for a nominal sum in settlement of a debt. Gilchrist never went to Australia, but as Sydney subsequently developed, the value of this holding (now part of the suburb named Balmain) rose substantially. Return to Britain In 1804, Gilchrist was granted leave of absence from his position at Fort William and travelled back to Britain. However, due to ill health, he never returned to India. He retired from the service of the East India Company in 1805 and was awarded a pension for the remainder of his life. He took an interest in the Borthwick title and, through a series of grants of arms, he eventually styled himself, \\"John Borthwick Gilchrist, of Camberwell, in the county of Surrey, LL.D., late Professor of the Hindoostanee Language in the College of Fort William, at Calcutta.\\" In 1806, when the East India College was established at Haileybury, Hertfordshire, its original plan called only for the teaching of Arabic and Persian. However, the first appointed Oriental Professor, Jonathan Scott, a scholar of these languages, resigned even before the College opened its doors. Gilchrist succeeded him but held the post only a few months. Later the same year, Gilchrist moved to Edinburgh where, in partnership with James Inglis, he founded a banking firm, Inglis, Borthwick Gilchrist & Co, which operated from a flat in Hunter Square. He also became in 1807 a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (proposed by William Moodie, John Playfair and James Bonar), the Horticultural Society, the East India Club, and the Scottish Military and Naval Academy. He gained a reputation for being somewhat eccentric, with a fiery temper and violent politics and language. One of his eccentricities was to erect an aviary containing exotic birds on the side of his house on Nicolson Square. In 1815 his banking business ran into difficulties and was dissolved. He moved for a brief period to Perthshire, resolving never to return to Edinburgh. He then moved to London in 1817 and the following year was appointed as lecturer in oriental languages for the East India Company, a position he held until 1825. However, after this employment ceased, he controversially continued to give lectures without payment, as a vehicle to promote the sale of his works as textbooks. With a similar view, he assisted in the foundation of the London Oriental Institution and became a founding shareholder of University College London, serving as its first Professor of Hindustani. He also worked with George Birkbeck to establish the London Mechanics Institution (later Birkbeck College). Marriage and children Gilchrist fathered a number of children during his time in India between 1782 and 1804. However, their legitimacy and the identity of the mother are unclear, and it appears that several died young. One surviving daughter, Mary Anne (b. 1786), may have remained in India after Gilchrist departed and it is known that, in 1810, she married Major Charles William Burton in Calcutta. He was the son of James Burton, canon of Christ Church, Oxford and chaplain to George III and George IV. Charles William Burton died at Mirzapur in 1816 and decades later, his and Mary Anne's son, Major Charles Aeneas Burton, was murdered together with his two sons at Kotah in 1857, during the Indian mutiny. It is also known that three other Indian-born daughters returned with Gilchrist to Britain: *Henrietta (1797‚Äì1864) married James Wilson, a merchant, in Edinburgh in 1815. *Elizabeth (b. 1801) married John Mann, a jeweller, in Edinburgh in 1818. *Violet (1802‚Äì1872) married the writer and composer, George Linley, in Edinburgh in 1824. After his return to Edinburgh, Gilchrist married Mary Ann Coventry on 15 May 1808, a woman nearly 30 years his junior, with whom he had no children. After he died, she married General Guglielmo Pepe, Prince of the Kingdom of Naples. Final years, death and legacy Tomb at the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery. Gilchrist travelled to the Continent several times between 1825 and 1831, for reasons of ill health. He settled in Paris almost permanently from 1831 onwards, obtaining a French passport for himself, his wife and two servants, and resided in the Rue Matignon. He died there on 9 January 1841, aged 81, and was buried in the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery. =Will= Gilchrist left a considerable fortune, which included property and investments in London and Edinburgh, as well as the Balmain estate in Australia. In his will, he appointed the Member of Parliament, Joseph Hume, to be his principal executor, and instructed that his assets be sold and the proceeds held in a charitable trust. From the Trust's income, he granted annuities to his widow and surviving daughters. The residual income he instructed to be used \\"for the benefit and advancement and propagation of education and learning in every part of the world as far as circumstances will permit.\\" =Legal battle= The will was contested by some members of Gilchrist's family. The principal appellant was his nephew, Walter Gilchrist Whicker (son of his sister, Helen), who considered himself to be Gilchrist's legitimate heir-at-law. The case, known as Whicker v Hume, was complex and considered several issues: * Gilchrist's legal domicile at the time of his death. It was argued that this should be Scotland or France (his countries of birth and death, respectively), rather than England, where the will had been drawn up. * The legitimacy of Gilchrist's Indian-born daughters. * The jurisdiction which applied to the land in the colony of New South Wales, and whether the legal doctrine of mortmain applied to it. * Whether Gilchrist's words \\"education and learning\\" constituted a valid charitable objective. The case dragged on for many years and eventually went as far as the House of Lords, which handed down its final judgement upholding the validity of the will in July 1858, over 17 years after Gilchrist's death and after which time several of the parties, including both Whicker and Hume, had themselves died. It has become a significant legal precedent, regarding the definition of domicile and the jurisdiction under which a will must be executed. =Gilchrist Educational Trust= An unexpected side-effect of the lengthy legal battle was that the value of the land in Australia had in the meantime increased to an estimated ¬£70,000, and the total value of Gilchrist's estate when probate was finally granted was in excess of ¬£100,000 (over ¬£10,000,000 in current values). With this large endowment, the Gilchrist Educational Trust was finally able in 1865 to start its work, and continues to the present day to provide financial grants to individuals and organizations for educational purposes. Character and political views Gilchrist had a fiery temperament and frequently became involved in arguments. He had a lifelong habit of expressing his views and frustrations in letters and printed pamphlets, blaming everyone except himself for the woes that afflicted him from time to time. He has been described as \\"alternately rambling and forthright, self- pitying and aggressive ‚Äì indeed, at times downright abusive.\\" Despite this, he was usually treated exceptionally well by those in a position of authority and patronage, and by various means he became a very wealthy man ‚Äì even if his business methods were sometimes rather unethical. During his time in Edinburgh, he became notorious for his radical political views and became an outspoken advocate of republicanism.

Early life and career Born in May 1956 and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota, he received his commission from the United States Naval Academy in 1978. Following a successful interview with Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, he was subsequently trained in the Navy's nuclear propulsion and submarine programs. Fowler served at sea as a junior officer aboard , as Engineer Officer for , and as executive officer for the Pre-commissioning Unit and . He commanded and Submarine Squadron Three, responsible for eight nuclear-powered fast attack submarines. Fowler has deployed to the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Arctic oceans, and the Persian Gulf.

Fowler relieved Vice Admiral Rodney P. Rempt as Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy on June 8, 2007. In August 2007, Fowler unveiled new plans for the Naval Academy, stating that the school was focusing too much on extracurriculars. Some of the new changes include mandatory study time each night for all Midshipmen, secured all weekday liberty (which Seniors had Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and Juniors Tuesday and Friday), and mandatory meals Sunday night through Friday night. Fowler stressed, however, that the Academy was not in a state of emergency, and that these changes were merely to keep the recent graduates ready to enter into wartime service. He cast the changes as having more to do with preparing future Navy and Marine officers for wartime duty than with cracking down on misbehavior. > We are a nation at war,\\" he said. \\"If any campus should understand being a > nation at war, it's the United States Naval Academy. Fowler stepped down as Superintendent of the Naval Academy in August 2010 (30 days earlier than his scheduled relief) amidst controversy over financial irregularities at the academy as well as multiple honor-code violations by USNA midshipmen.

He now runs a goalkeeper coaching school in Ireland.  Playing career  Gregg played cricket for Gloucestershire up to under-16 level before deciding to concentrate on his football career. He played for Gloucester Primary Schools alongside future Torquay United teammate Wayne Thomas. He began his senior career as an apprentice with Torquay United, making his debut while still aged only 16 in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Wigan Athletic on 16 September 1995. He then returned to the reserves and his apprenticeship, appearing once more, in the last match of the 1996‚Äì97 season away to Doncaster Rovers, before turning professional in July 1997. He played another 30 times for Torquay, including the 1997‚Äì98 play-off final due to regular keeper Ken Veysey being suspended, before moving to Crystal Palace in October 1998 for a fee of ¬£400,000. He joined Swansea City on loan in February 1999, before making his Palace debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Fulham at Craven Cottage in April 2000. He struggled to win a place in the first team, and the arrival of Matt Clarke from Bradford City pushed Gregg further out of contention and on 14 September 2001 he joined Exeter City on loan. Career in Ireland He left Selhurst Park on 25 October 2001, joining Irish side Bray Wanderers on a free transfer. Gregg impressed at Bray and earned a move in April 2003 to then champions, Bohemians.\\"Eircom Shorts\\". The Irish Times. 9 April 2003 He spent four years at Dalymount Park where he established himself as first choice and making numerous European appearances and later moved to UCD for the 2007 season. He made his UCD debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Sligo Rovers on 1 April 2007 and started his UCD career with five clean sheets in his first eight appearances. He traded places with Darren Quigley through the 2007 season and his performances became shaky as he faded to second choice by season's end. Gregg appeared to have rejoined Bray Wanderers for the 2008 season, but re-signed for UCD when Quigley left the club. He began the 2008 season as first choice keeper and firmly claimed the number one spot as his own with some vastly improved performances including a dramatic equalising injury time headed goal against Cobh Ramblers. In December 2008, he was short-listed for the Eircom/Soccer Writers Association of Ireland Goalkeeper of the Year award, but lost out to Bohemians keeper Brian Murphy. With UCD relegated to Division One at the end of the 2008 season, Gregg rejoined Bohemians in January 2009. He was released in November 2009 after his contract expired. Gregg signed for Dundalk on 18 January 2010 to battle Peter Cherrie for the number one spot. Gregg's appearances for Dundalk were limited due to Cherrie's excellent form in goal. Gregg left Dundalk by mutual agreement on 24 June 2010, citing lack of first team football as the main reason for his departure. Gregg moved back to Bray in July 2010 in time for the friendly against Spanish side Villarreal and was substituted on at half time. Bray lost 5‚Äì0 although Gregg put in a good performance. His performances continued in this vein with Gregg being instrumental in turning around Bray's season and helping them overhaul a ten-point deficit at the bottom of the league to retain their Premier League status. Bray manager Pat Delvin hailed Gregg's professionalism in helping keep his team in the Premier Division. Gregg went on to play one more year for the Seagulls, helping them to a mid table finish. He then decided to hang up the Gloves (despite numerous offers) to concentrate on his Goalkeeper Coaching Career with Just4Keepers, where he has helped several young keepers achieve their dream of becoming professionals.

It is named for the collector of the first specimen, and its closest relative is probably Hatt's vesper rat, a similar, but slightly smaller, species from the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Description Sumichrast's vesper rat is a relatively small rat, with an adult length of , not including the tail, which is only slightly shorter. Males and females are of similar size, with both weighing between . It is one of the more brightly coloured rats, with a reddish or orange back and creamy to white underparts. The rats have a thick pelt of soft fur, which extends over the entire length of the tail, and is absent only on the soles of the feet. The eyes are relatively large, and surrounded by a narrow ring of black hair, while the whiskers are long and the ears small. To aid in climbing, the claws are compressed and curved, and the first toe on each foot is thumb-like. Distribution and subspecies Sumichrast's vesper rat is found from southern Jalisco and Veracruz in Mexico through much of Central America, excluding the Yucatan, as far east as central Panama. It occurs in evergreen and semi- deciduous forests throughout this range, at elevations from sea level to as high as . A total of nine subspecies are currently recognised: * N. s. sumichrasti - southern Veracruz, Mexico * N. s. colimensis - Jalisco to Oaxaca, Mexico * N. s. costaricensis - southern Costa Rica * N. s. decolorus - southern Belize and eastern Guatemala to Honduras * N. s. florencei - southern Honduras and western Nicaragua * N. s. nitellinus - eastern Costa Rica to central Panama * N. s. pallidulus - southern Tabasco and western Chiapas * N. s. salvini - eastern Chiapas and southern Guatemala * N. s. venustulus - eastern Nicaragua Biology and behaviour Sumichrast's vesper rat is unusual in that it is arboreal, and builds nests of twigs and leaves. They rarely travel along the ground, preferring to remain in the middle and upper parts of the forest canopy, between high. They build their nests in tree hollows or in the forks of branches, constructing an irregular mass of material with a hollow central cavity about across, often building them on top of older nests so that a series of multiple layers builds up over time. It is nocturnal and herbivorous, eating fruits and seeds, although it has been reported to eat a small number of moths. Favoured foods include figs, and the seeds of plants such as Jacquinia pungens and borage. In Costa Rica, they have also been observed to eat the poisonous leaves of the plant Daphnopsis americana, although avoiding the central part of the leaf, and selecting only young leaves. They follow established paths along branches in search of food, and have a home range of about across. Although they move slowly when compelled to travel along the ground, and make slow deliberate movements while feeding or grooming, they are agile in the trees, moving rapidly and constantly twitching their whiskers and ears. Under laboratory conditions, the rats remain in family groups of mated pairs, but are intolerant of any strangers, often attacking them. They have been observed to make high-pitched, musical chirps and trills, while males sometimes make lower pitched grunts towards established mates. Reproduction Mating occurs throughout the year. Gestation lasts from 30 to 38 days and results in the birth of one to three young. The young are reared in a nest constructed by both parents, although the male usually remains outside the nest for the first seven days after birth. The young are about long at birth, and weigh . They are initially blind and only partially furred, and remain attached to the mother's teats for most of their first two weeks, although they are able to crawl from two days of age. They are weaned at around three weeks, and their eyes open after fifteen to eighteen days. The rats become sexually mature at around 75 days of age, and have lived for up to five years in captivity.

Career  Friis-Christensen received a Magisterkonferens (Ph.D. equivalent) in Geophysics from University of Copenhagen in 1971. In 1972, he was a geophysicist at the Danish Meteorological Institute. His interest in solar activity began in August, in his tent, when he experienced an extreme solar storm: > \\"I was in Greenland, on my first assignment in my new job as geophysicist at > the Danish Meteorological Institute, setting up a chain of magnetometer > stations on the west coast... watching ink pens of my recorder going so wild > that they nearly tore the paper chart apart -- we had no digital recording > at that time -- and I wondered whether such big events could also have an > influence in the lower atmosphere, on weather and climate. That storm cut > off my contact to the outside world for nine days -- all radio communication > was blacked out -- so I had lots of time to reflect on the enormity of the > forces at play.\\" Between 1976 and 1997, he was the Principal Investigator of the Greenland Magnetometer Array. Between 1991 and 1997, he was Head of the Solar- Terrestrial Physics Division, Danish Meteorological Institute. In 1992, he was also the Project scientist on the first Danish satellite, √òrsted, which was launched February 1999. He was an Adjunct Professor of geophysics and space physics 1996 to 2006 at the Niels Bohr Institute of University of Copenhagen and has authored over 140 research articles or books. He lectures worldwide; in 2008 he made a presentation at the U.S. National Institute of Aerospace. From 2004 until 2012 Friis-Christensen was Director of the Danish National Space Center.  Solar activity and climate change  Friis-Christensen's 1991 paper, \\"Length of the Solar Cycle: An Indicator of Solar Activity Closely Associated with Climate\\", published in Science, presented his findings on global warming and sun activity correlation. The New York Times reviewed the Science article on 5 November 1991, stating, \\"While the correlation established by Dr. Friis-Christensen and Dr. Lassen falls short of definite proof, a number of scientists nevertheless called it remarkable in its close fit between the solar and temperature trends.\\" Subsequent work with updated data has found that the correlation has not stood up. In 2009, a number of leading experts, including one Nobel laureate, concluded that the graphs of Friis-Christensen and Svensmark showing apparent correlations between global warming, sunspots and cosmic rays were deeply flawed. Friis-Christensen agreed that any correlation between sunspots and global warming that he may have identified in the 1991 study has since broken down. There is, he said, a clear \\"divergence\\" between the sunspots and global temperatures after 1986, which shows that the present warming period cannot be explained by solar activity alone.

Octopus vulgaris is the most studied of all octopus species. It is considered cosmopolitan, that is, a global species, which ranges from the eastern Atlantic, extends from the Mediterranean Sea and the southern coast of England, to at least Senegal in Africa. It also occurs off the Azores, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde Islands. The species is also common in the Western Atlantic. The common octopus hunts at dusk. Crabs, crayfish, and bivalve molluscs (two-shelled, such as cockles) are preferred, although the octopus eats almost anything it can catch. It is able to change colour to blend in with its surroundings, and is able to jump upon any unwary prey that strays across its path. Using its beak, it is able to break into the shells of shelled molluscs. Training experiments have shown the common octopus can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects.

Cephalopods: A World Guide. ConchBooks. O. vulgaris is caught by bottom trawls on a huge scale off the northwestern coast of Africa. More than 20,000 tonnes are harvested annually. The common octopus hunts at dusk. Crabs, crayfish, and bivalve molluscs (such as cockles) are preferred, although the octopus eats almost anything it can catch. It is able to change colour to blend in with its surroundings, and is able to jump upon any unwary prey that strays across its path. Using its beak, it is able to break into the shells of shelled molluscs. It also possesses venom to subdue its prey. Training experiments have shown the common octopus can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects. They are intelligent enough to learn how to unscrew a jar and are known to raid lobster traps. O. vulgaris was the first invertebrate animal protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in the UK; it was included because of its high intelligence.  Physiology = Habitat and demands  The common octopus is typically found in tropical waters throughout the world, such as the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic.Belcari, P., Cuccu, D., Gonz√°lez, M., Srairi, A. & Vidoris, P. (2002) Distribution and abundance of Octopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797, (Cephalopoda: Octopoda) in the Mediterranean Sea. Scientia Marina, 66(S2): 157‚Äì166. . They prefer the floor of relatively shallow, rocky, coastal waters, often no deeper than 200 m. Although they prefer around 36 grams per liter, salinity throughout their global habitat is found to be between roughly 30 and 45 grams of salt per liter of water.Moreno, A., Louren√ßo, S., Pereira, J., Gaspar, M.B., Cabral, H.N., Pierce, G.J., et al. (2013). Essential habits for pre- recruit Octopus vulgaris along the Portuguese coast. Fisheries Research, 152: 74‚Äì85. . They are exposed to a wide variety of temperatures in their environments, but their preferred temperature ranges from about 15 to 16 ¬∞C. In especially warm seasons, the octopus can often be found deeper than usual to escape the warmer layers of water.Katsanevakis, S. & Verriopoulos, G. (2004). Abundance of Octopus vulgaris on soft sediment. Scientia Marina, 68, 553‚Äì560. . In moving vertically throughout the water, the octopus is subjected to various pressures and temperatures, which affect the concentration of oxygen available in the water. This can be understood through Henry's law, which states that the concentration of a gas in a substance is proportional to pressure and solubility, which is influenced by temperature. These various discrepancies in oxygen availability introduce a requirement for regulation methods.Valverde, Jes√∫s C. & Garc√≠a, Benjamin. (2005). Suitable dissolved oxygen levels for common octopus (Octopus vulgaris cuvier, 1797) at different weights and temperature: analysis of respiratory behavior. Aquaculture. 244: 303‚Äì314. . Primarily, the octopus situates itself in a shelter where a minimal amount of its body is presented to the external water, which would pose a problem for an organism that breathes solely through its skin.Madan, J.J. & Wells, M.J. (1996). Cutaneous respiration in Octopus vulgaris. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 199: 2477‚Äì2483 When it does move, most of the time it is along the ocean or sea floor, in which case the underside of the octopus is still obscured. This crawling increases metabolic demands greatly, requiring they increase their oxygen intake by roughly 2.4 times the amount required for a resting octopus.Katsanevakis, S., Stephanopoulou, S., Miliou, H., Moraitou- Apostolopoulou, M. & Verriopoulos, G. (2005). Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion of Octopus vulgaris (Cephalopoda) in relation to body mass and temperature. Marine Biology, 146, 725‚Äì732. . This increased demand is met by an increase in the stroke volume of the octopus' heart.Wells, M.J., Duthie, G.G., Houlihan, D.F., Smith, P.J.S. & Wells, J. (1987). Blood flow and pressure changes in exercising octopuses (Octopus vulgaris). The Journal of Experimental Biology, 131, 175‚Äì187 The octopus does sometimes swim throughout the water, exposing itself completely. In doing so, it uses a jet mechanism that involves creating a much higher pressure in its mantle cavity that allows it to propel itself through the water. As the common octopus' heart and gills are located within its mantle, this high pressure also constricts and puts constraints on the various vessels that are returning blood to the heart. Ultimately, this creates circulation issues and is not a sustainable form of transportation, as the octopus cannot attain an oxygen intake that can balance the metabolic demands of maximum exertion.  Respiration  The octopus uses gills as its respiratory surface. The gill is composed of branchial ganglia and a series of folded lamellae. Primary lamellae extend out to form demibranches and are further folded to form the secondary free folded lamellae, which are only attached at their tops and bottoms.Young, Richard E. & Vecchione, Michael. (2002). Evolution of the gills in the octopodiformes. Bulletin of marine science. 71(2): 1003‚Äì1017 The tertiary lamellae are formed by folding the secondary lamellae in a fan-like shape. Water moves slowly in one direction over the gills and lamellae, into the mantle cavity and out of the octopus' funnel.Wells, M.J., & Wells, J. (1995). The control of ventilatory and cardiac responses to changes in ambient oxygen tension and oxygen demand in Octopus. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 198, 1717‚Äì1727 The structure of the octopus' gills allows for a high amount of oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20‚Å∞C. The thin skin of the octopus accounts for a large portion of in-vitro oxygen uptake; estimates suggest around 41% of all oxygen absorption is through the skin when at rest. This number is affected by the activity of the animal ‚Äì the oxygen uptake increases when the octopus is exercising due to its entire body being constantly exposed to water, but the total amount of oxygen absorption through skin is actually decreased to 33% as a result of the metabolic cost of swimming. When the animal is curled up after eating, its absorption through its skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake. The octopus' respiratory pigment, hemocyanin, also assists in increasing oxygen uptake. Octopuses can maintain a constant oxygen uptake even when oxygen concentrations in the water decrease to around 3.5 kPa or 31.6% saturation (standard deviation 8.3%). If oxygen saturation in sea water drops to about 1‚Äì10% it can be fatal for Octopus vulgaris depending on the weight of the animal and the water temperature. Ventilation may increase to pump more water carrying oxygen across the gills but due to receptors found on the gills the energy use and oxygen uptake remains at a stable rate. The high percent of oxygen extraction allows for energy saving and benefits for living in an area of low oxygen concentration. Water is pumped into the mantle cavity of the octopus, where it comes into contact with the internal gills. The water has a high concentration of oxygen compared to the blood returning from the veins, so oxygen diffuses into the blood. The tissues and muscles of the octopus use oxygen and release carbon dioxide when breaking down glucose in the Krebs cycle. The carbon dioxide then dissolves into the blood or combines with water to form carbonic acid, which decreases blood pH. The Bohr effect explains why oxygen concentrations are lower in venous blood than arterial blood and why oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream. The rate of diffusion is affected by the distance the oxygen has to travel from the water to the bloodstream as indicated by Fick's laws of diffusion. Fick's laws explain why the gills of the octopus contain many small folds that are highly vascularised. They increase surface area, thus also increase the rate of diffusion. The capillaries that line the folds of the gill epithelium have a very thin tissue barrier (10 ¬µm), which allows for fast, easy diffusion of the oxygen into the blood.Eno, N.C. (August 1994). The morphometrics of cephalopod gills. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 74(3), 687‚Äì706 In situations where the partial pressure of oxygen in the water is low, diffusion of oxygen into the blood is reduced,Melzner, F., Block, C. & P√∂rtner, H.O. (2006). Temperature-dependent oxygen extraction from the ventilatory current and the costs of ventilation in the cephalopod Sepia officinalis. Journal of Comparative Physiology B, 176, 607‚Äì621 Henry's law can explain this phenomenon. The law states that at equilibrium, the partial pressure of oxygen in water will be equal to that in air; but the concentrations will differ due to the differing solubility. This law explains why O. vulgaris has to alter the amount of water cycled through its mantle cavity as the oxygen concentration in water changes. The gills are in direct contact with water ‚Äì carrying more oxygen than the blood ‚Äì that has been brought into the mantle cavity of the octopus. Gill capillaries are quite small and abundant, which creates an increased surface area that water can come into contact with, thus resulting in enhanced diffusion of oxygen into the blood. Some evidence indicates that lamellae and vessels within the lamellae on the gills contract to aid in propelling blood through the capillaries.Wells, M.J., & Smith, P.J.S. (1987). The performance of the octopus circulatory system: A triumph of engineering over design. Experientia, 43, 487‚Äì499  Circulation  The octopus has three hearts, one main two-chambered heart charged with sending oxygenated blood to the body and two smaller branchial hearts, one next to each set of gills. The circulatory circuit sends oxygenated blood from the gills to the atrium of the systemic heart, then to its ventricle which pumps this blood to the rest of the body. Deoxygenated blood from the body goes to the branchial hearts which pump the blood across the gills to oxygenate it, and then the blood flows back to the systemic atrium for the process to begin again.Wells, M.J. (1980). Nervous control of the heartbeat in Octopus. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 85, 111‚Äì128. . Three aortae leave the systemic heart, two minor ones (the abdominal aorta and the gonadal aorta) and one major one, the dorsal aorta which services most of the body.Smith, P.J.S. (1981). The role of venous pressure in regulation of output from the heart of the octopus, Eledone cirrhosa (Lam.). The Journal of Experimental Biology, 93, 243‚Äì255 The octopus also has large blood sinuses around its gut and behind its eyes that function as reserves in times of physiologic stress.O'Dor, R.K., & Wells, M.J. (1984). Circulation time, blood reserves and extracellular space in a cephalopod. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 113, 461‚Äì464. . The octopus' heart rate does not change significantly with exercise, though temporary cardiac arrest of the systemic heart can be induced by oxygen debt, almost any sudden stimulus, or mantle pressure during jet propulsion.Wells, M.J. (1979). The heartbeat of Octopus vulgaris. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 78, 87‚Äì104 Its only compensation for exertion is through an increase in stroke volume of up to three times by the systemic heart, which means it suffers an oxygen debt with almost any rapid movement.Shadwick, R.E., & Nilsson E.K.. (1990). The importance of vascular elasticity in the circulatory system of the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 152, 471‚Äì484 The octopus is, however, able to control how much oxygen it pulls out of the water with each breath using receptors on its gills, allowing it to keep its oxygen uptake constant over a range of oxygen pressures in the surrounding water. The three hearts are also temperature and oxygen dependent and the beat rhythm of the three hearts are generally in phase with the two branchial hearts beating together followed by the systemic heart. The Frank‚ÄìStarling law also contributes to overall heart function, through contractility and stroke volume, since the total volume of blood vessels must be maintained, and must be kept relatively constant within the system for the heart to function properly.Hill, Richard W., Gordon A. Wyse, and Margaret Anderson. Animal Physiology. 3rd ed. Sunderland, MA: (635‚Äì636, 654‚Äì657, 671‚Äì672) Sinauer Associates, 2012. Print The blood of the octopus is composed of copper-rich hemocyanin, which is less efficient than the iron-rich hemoglobin of vertebrates, thus does not increase oxygen affinity to the same degree. Oxygenated hemocyanin in the arteries binds to CO2, which is then released when the blood in the veins is deoxygenated. The release of CO2 into the blood causes it to acidify by forming carbonic acid.P√∂rtner, H.O. (1994). Coordination of metabolism, acid-base regulation and haemocyanin function in cephalopods. Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology, 25(1‚Äì3), 131‚Äì148. . The Bohr effect explains that carbon dioxide concentrations affect the blood pH and the release or intake of oxygen. The Krebs cycle uses the oxygen from the blood to break down glucose in active tissues or muscles and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product, which leads to more oxygen being released. Oxygen released into the tissues or muscles creates deoxygenated blood, which returns to the gills in veins. The two brachial hearts of the octopus pump blood from the veins through the gill capillaries. The newly oxygenated blood drains from the gill capillaries into the systemic heart, where it is then pumped back throughout the body. Blood volume in the octopus' body is about 3.5% of its body weight but the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity is only about 4 volume percent. This contributes to their susceptibility to the oxygen debt mentioned before. Shadwick and Nilsson concluded that the octopus circulatory system is \\"fundamentally unsuitable for high physiologic performance\\". Since the binding agent is found within the plasma and not the blood cells, a limit exists to the oxygen uptake that the octopus can experience. If it were to increase the hemocyanin within its blood stream, the fluid would become too viscous for the myogenicExcitation-contraction coupling hearts to pump. Poiseuille's law explains the rate of flow of the bulk fluid throughout the entire circulatory system through the differences of blood pressure and vascular resistance. Like those of vertebrates, octopus blood vessels are very elastic, with a resilience of 70% at physiologic pressures. They are primarily made of an elastic fibre called octopus arterial elastomer, with stiffer collagen fibres recruited at high pressure to help the vessel maintain its shape without over-stretching.Shadwick, Robert E. & Gosline, John M. (1985). Mechanical properties of the octopus aorta. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 114, 259‚Äì284 Shadwick and NilssonShadwick, R.E., & Nilsson E.K.. (1990). The importance of vascular elasticity in the circulatory system of the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 152, 471‚Äì484 theorized that all octopus blood vessels may use smooth-muscle contractions to help move blood through the body, which would make sense in the context of them living under water with the attendant pressure. The elasticity and contractile nature of the octopus aorta serves to smooth out the pulsing nature of blood flow from the heart as the pulses travel the length of the vessel, while the vena cava serves in an energy-storage capacity. Stroke volume of the systemic heart changes inversely with the difference between the input blood pressure through the vena cava and the output back pressure through the aorta.  Osmoregulation  The hemolymph, pericardial fluid and urine of cephalopods, including the common octopus, are all isosmotic with each other, as well as with the surrounding sea water.Wells, M.J. (1978). Octopus: Physiology and behaviour of an advanced invertebrate. Cambridge: University Printing House. It has been suggested that cephalopods do not osmoregulate, which would indicate that they are conformers. This means that they adapt to match the osmotic pressure of their environment, and because there is no osmotic gradient, there is no net movement of water from the organism to the seawater, or from the seawater into the organism. Octopuses have an average minimum salinity requirement of 27g/l, and that any disturbance introducing significant amounts of fresh water into their environment can prove fatal.Vaz-Pires, P., Seixas, P. & Barbosa, A. 2004. Aquaculture potential of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797): a review. Aquaculture, 238, 221‚Äì238. . In terms of ions, however, a discrepancy does seem to occur between ionic concentrations found in the seawater and those found within cephalopods. In general, they seem to maintain hypoionic concentrations of sodium, calcium, and chloride in contrast to the salt water. Sulfate and potassium exist in a hypoionic state, as well, with the exception of the excretory systems of cephalopods, where the urine is hyperionic. These ions are free to diffuse, and because they exist in hypoionic concentrations within the organism, they would be moving into the organism from the seawater. The fact that the organism can maintain hypoionic concentrations suggests not only that a form of ionic regulation exists within cephalopods, but also that they also actively excrete certain ions such as potassium and sulfate to maintain homeostasis. O. vulgaris has a mollusc-style kidney system, which is very different from mammals. The system is built around an appendage of each branchial heart, which is essentially an extension of its pericardium. These long, ciliated ducts filter the blood into a pair of kidney sacs, while actively reabsorbing glucose and amino acids into the bloodstream. The renal sacs actively adjust the ionic concentrations of the urine, and actively add nitrogenous compounds and other metabolic waste products to the urine. Once filtration and reabsorption are complete, the urine is emptied into O. vulgaris' mantle cavity via a pair of renal papillae, one from each renal sac. Temperature and body size directly affect the oxygen consumption of O. vulgaris, which alters the rate of metabolism. When oxygen consumption decreases, the amount of ammonia excretion also decreases due to the slowed metabolic rate. O. vulgaris has four different fluids found within its body: blood, pericardial fluid, urine, and renal fluid. The urine and renal fluid have high concentrations of potassium and sulphate, but low concentrations of chloride. The urine has low calcium concentrations, which suggests it has been actively removed. The renal fluid has similar calcium concentrations to the blood. Chloride concentrations are high in the blood, while sodium varies. The pericardial fluid has concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorine and calcium similar to that of the salt water supporting the idea that O. vulgaris does not osmoregulate, but conforms. However, it has lower sulphate concentrations. The pericardial duct contains an ultrafiltrate of the blood known as the pericardial fluid, and the rate of filtration is partly controlled by the muscle- and nerve-rich branchial hearts. The renal appendages move nitrogenous and other waste products from the blood to the renal sacs, but do not add volume. The renal fluid has a higher concentration of ammonia than the urine or the blood, thus the renal sacs are kept acidic to help draw the ammonia from the renal appendages. The ammonia diffuses down its concentration gradient into the urine or into the blood, where it gets pumped through the branchial hearts and diffuses out the gills. The excretion of ammonia by O. vulgaris makes them ammonotelic organisms. Aside from ammonia, a few other nitrogenous waste products have been found to be excreted by O. vulgaris such as urea, uric acid, purines, and some free amino acids, but in smaller amounts. Within the renal sacs, two recognized and specific cells are responsible for the regulation of ions. The two kinds of cells are the lacuna- forming cells and the epithelial cells that are typical to kidney tubules. The epithelia cells are ciliated, cylindrical, and polarized with three distinct regions. These three regions are apical, middle cytoplasmic, and basal lamina. The middle cytoplasmic region is the most active of the three due to the concentration of multiple organelles within, such as mitochondria and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, among others. The increase of activity is due to the interlocking labyrinth of the basal lamina creating a crosscurrent activity similar to the mitochondrial-rich cells found in teleost marine fish. The lacuna-forming cells are characterized by contact to the basal lamina, but not reaching the apical rim of the associated epithelial cells and are located in the branchial heart epithelium. The shape varies widely and are occasionally more electron-dense than the epithelial cells, seen as a \\"diffused kidney\\" regulating ion concentrations.Witmer, A. (1975). The fine structure of the renopericardial cavity of the cephalopod ocotopus dofleine martini. Journal of Ultrastructure Research, (53), 29‚Äì36. One adaptation that O. vulgaris has is some direct control over its kidneys. It is able to switch at will between the right or left kidney doing the bulk of the filtration, and can also regulate the filtration rate so that the rate does not increase when the animal's blood pressure goes up due to stress or exercise. Some species of octopuses, including O. vulgaris, also have a duct that runs from the gonadal space into the branchial pericardium. Wells theorized that this duct, which is highly vascularized and innervated, may enable the reabsorption of important metabolites from the ovisac fluid of pregnant females by directing this fluid into the renal appendages.  Thermoregulation  As an oceanic organism, O. vulgaris experiences a temperature variance due to many factors, such as season, geographical location, and depth.Hill, R.W., Wyse, G.A., & Anderson, M. (2012). Animal Physiology. Sunderland: SinauerAssociates pp. 164‚Äì165. For example, octopuses living around Naples may experience a temperature of 25¬∞C in the summer and 15¬∞C in the winter. These changes would occur quite gradually, however, and thus would not require any extreme regulation. The common octopus is a poikilothermic, eurythermic ectotherm, meaning that it conforms to the ambient temperature.Katsanevakis, S., Protopapas, N., Miliou, H. & Verriopoulos, G. (2005). Effect of temperature on specific dynamic action in the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris (Cephalopoda). Marine Biology, 146, 733‚Äì738. This implies that no real temperature gradient is seen between the organism and its environment, and the two are quickly equalized. If the octopus swims to a warmer locale, it gains heat from the surrounding water, and if it swims to colder surroundings, it loses heat in a similar fashion. O. vulgaris can apply behavioral changes to manage wide varieties of environmental temperatures. Respiration rate in octopods is temperature- sensitive ‚Äì respiration increases with temperature.Yin F., et al. 2013. The respiration, excretion and biochemical response of the juvenile common Chinese cuttlefish, Sepiella maindroni at different temperatures. Aquaculture. 402‚Äì403: 127‚Äì132. . Its oxygen consumption increases when in water temperatures between 16 and 28¬∞C, reaches a maximum at 28¬∞C, and then begins to drop at 32¬∞C. The optimum temperature for metabolism and oxygen consumption is between 18and 24¬∞C. Variations in temperature can also induce a change in hemolymph protein levels along oxygen consumption. As temperature increases, protein concentrations increase in order to accommodate the temperature. Also the cooperativity of hemocyanin increases, but the affinity decreases.Zeilinski S., et al. 2001. Temperature effects on hemocyanin oxygen binding in an antarctic cephalopod. The Biological Bulletin. 200(1): 67‚Äì76. . . Conversely, a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in respiratory pigment cooperativity and increase in affinity. The slight rise in P50 that occurs with temperature change allows oxygen pressure to remain high in the capillaries, allowing for elevated diffusion of oxygen into the mitochondria during periods of high oxygen consumption. The increase in temperature results in higher enzyme activity, yet the decrease in hemocyanin affinity allows enzyme activity to remain constant and maintain homeostasis. The highest hemolymph protein concentrations are seen at 32¬∞C and then drop at temperatures above this. Oxygen affinity in the blood decreases by 0.20 kPa/¬∞C at a pH of 7.4. The octopod's thermal tolerance is limited by its ability to consume oxygen, and when it fails to provide enough oxygen to circulate at extreme temperatures the effects can be fatal. O. vulgaris has a pH- independent venous reserve that represents the amount of oxygen that remains bound to the respiratory pigment at constant pressure of oxygen. This reserve allows the octopus to tolerate a wide range of pH related to temperature. As a temperature conformer,Noyola, J., Caamal-Monsreal, C., D√≠az, F., Re, D., S√°nchez, A., & Rosas, C. (2013). Thermopreference, tolerance and metabolic rate of early stages juvenile Octopus maya acclimated to different temperatures. Journal of Thermal Biology, 38, 14‚Äì19. O. vulgaris does not have any specific organ or structure dedicated to heat production or heat exchange. Like all animals, they produce heat as a result of ordinary metabolic processes such as digestion of food, but take no special means to keep their body temperature within a certain range. Their preferred temperature directly reflects the temperature to which they are acclimated. They have an acceptable ambient temperature range of 13‚Äì28¬∞C, with their optimum for maximum metabolic efficiency being about 20¬∞C. As ectothermal animals, common octopuses are highly influenced by changes in temperature. All species have a thermal preference where they can function at their basal metabolic rate. The low metabolic rate allows for rapid growth, thus these cephalopods mate as the water becomes closest to the preferential zone. Increasing temperatures cause an increase in oxygen consumption by O. vulgaris. Increased oxygen consumption can be directly related to the metabolic rate, because the breakdown of molecules such as glucose requires an input of oxygen, as explained by the Krebs cycle. The amount of ammonia excreted conversely decreases with increasing temperature. The decrease in ammonia being excreted is also related to the metabolism of the octopus due to its need to spend more energy as the temperature increases. Octopus vulgaris will reduce the amount of ammonia excreted in order to use the excess solutes that it would have otherwise excreted due to the increased metabolic rate. Octopuses do not regulate their internal temperatures until it reaches a threshold where they must begin to regulate to prevent death. The increase in metabolic rate shown with increasing temperatures is likely due to the octopus swimming to shallower or deeper depths to stay within its preferential temperature zone.

The club was officially formed in 1884 and the team played its first game in February 1885. St Johnstone first appeared in the Scottish Cup in the 1886‚Äì87 season and they joined the Scottish Football League in 1911‚Äì12. The club has had three home grounds, the current one since 1989 is McDiarmid Park. St Johnstone have won only one major honour which was the Scottish Cup with a 2‚Äì0 win against Dundee United in 2014. Their highest placing in the league is third place (three times, most recently in 2013). St Johnstone have qualified for either the UEFA Cup or the Europa League in six seasons; these include four consecutive seasons from 2013 to 2016. They have reached two Scottish League Cup finals: 1969 and 1998, losing both. Including the 2016‚Äì17 season, the team have spent 46 seasons in the top tier of the Scottish football league system, 44 in the second and 4 in the third. The table summarises their seasons from 1886‚Äì87 in Scottish and European football. It highlights the club's achievements in senior first team competitions, lists their managers and, where known, the top goalscorer(s) in each season. Some seasons to 1921‚Äì22 and the wartime seasons 1915‚Äì19 and 1939‚Äì45, in which the club did not compete in top-level football (e.g., Scottish Football League, Scottish Cup), are excluded.

The G26 was developed to increase traction capacities on the tracks which supported lesser axle loadings. They were intended for main line freight and passenger traffic. Rail companies using the G26 locomotives in the past or present include Australian Railroad Group, Freight Australia, Croatian Railways, Slovenian Railways, Serbian Railways, PT Kereta Api in Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran Railways, Israel Railways, Korail, ONCF in Morocco, MTR Corporation, and others. Australia The Victorian Railways purchased 24 G26C locomotives built in Australia by Clyde Engineering, called the X class. They are now operated by Pacific National and SCT Logistics. Queensland Rail purchased 102 GL26C-2 locomotives in 1970, locally built by Comeng as sub- contractor for Clyde Engineering, and known as the 2100 class. Ten of the 2100 class have since been sold to FCAB, Chile. Tasrail in Tasmania, operates four GL26C locomotives formerly of Queensland Rail. Known as the 2050 class. And two G26C locomotives known as the D class which are due to be retired late in 2014.

Primarily used in passenger service, all were withdrawn from the roster by the end of the 1990s.  Indonesia  Double heading of CC202s, hauling long-consist coal train. The Indonesian State Railways purchased 15 G26MC-2U locomotives in 1986, classified as CC202 and numbered from 01-15. Later orders arrived in 1990 (15 locomotives, CC202 16-30), 1995 (3 locomotives, CC202 31-33), 2001 (4 locomotives, CC202 34-37), 2002 (2 locomotives, CC202 38-39) and finally in 2008 (9 locomotives, CC202 40-48). The locomotives have an axle loading of 18 tons, and were originally used for bulk coal traffic between Tanjungenim (South Sumatra) and Tarahan (Lampung) pulling 50-60 coal gondolas in multiple operation. They have since been supplanted by the more modern CC205. Beginning in 2010 a new numbering system was introduced, inserting two final digits of the date of manufacture of the locomotive. The individual numbers are restarted for each batch Hence the first batch (CC202 01-15) becomes CC202 86 01-86 15, and the second batch (CC202 16-30) becoming CC202 90 01-90 15. Except for CC202 90 01, scrapped after a crash in 2012, all the locomotives remain in operation. The locomotives are based in the Tanjungkarang depot (Lampung).

The library is located in the so-called Stock Exchange Building () at 4, K√§llargr√§nd, a short alley passing between Slottsbacken and Stortorget in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Since its foundation in 1901, the primary task of the library is to acquire literary works and journals needed for the evaluation of the laureates, a task achieved by collecting works mainly in other languages than Swedish. , the collection encompasses some 200,000 volumes and is thus one of the largest libraries devoted to literature in northern Europe. The library is offering loans to the general public and to other libraries in Nordic countries, as well as guided tours on request, lectures, and seminars. The library was founded on November 16, 1901 in connection to the inauguration of the Nobel Institute of the Swedish Academy. It was first accommodated in a ten-room-flat at Norra Bantorget in a building designed by Ferdinand Boberg, the so-called LO-borgen today accommodating the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) but at the time called Vasaborgen (\\"The Castle of Vasa\\"). The collection encompassed some 15,000 literary works after five years and within two decades the library had become cramped for space and was relocated to its present address.

Plans are a set of drawings or two-dimensional diagrams used to describe a place or object, or to communicate building or fabrication instructions. Usually plans are drawn or printed on paper, but they can take the form of a digital file. These plans are used in a range of fields from architecture, urban planning, landscape architecture, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, industrial engineering to systems engineering.  Overview  Plans are often for technical purposes such as architecture, engineering, or planning. Their purpose in these disciplines is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a site, building, product or component. Plans can also be for presentation or orientation purposes, and as such are often less detailed versions of the former. The end goal of plans is either to portray an existing place or object, or to convey enough information to allow a builder or manufacturer to realize a design. The term \\"plan\\" may casually be used to refer to a single view, sheet, or drawing in a set of plans. More specifically a plan view is an orthographic projection looking down on the object, such as in a floor plan. The process of producing plans, and the skill of producing them, is often referred to as technical drawing. A working drawing is a type of technical drawing, which is part of the documentation needed to build an engineering product or architecture. Typically in architecture these could include civil drawings, architectural drawings, structural drawings, mechanical drawings, electrical drawings, and plumbing drawings. In engineering, these drawings show all necessary data to manufacture a given object, such as dimensions and angles.  Plan features = Format  Plans are often prepared in a \\"set\\". The set includes all the information required for the purpose of the set, and may exclude views or projections which are unnecessary. A set of plans can be on standard office-sized paper or on large sheets. It can be stapled, folded or rolled as required. A set of plans can also take the form of a digital file in a proprietary format such as DWG or an exchange file format such as DXF or PDF. Plans are often referred to as \\"blueprints\\" or \\"bluelines\\". However, the terms are rapidly becoming an anachronism, since these copying methods have mostly been superseded by reproduction processes that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper, or by electronic representations of information.  Scale  Plans are usually \\"scale drawings\\", meaning that the plans are drawn at a specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:48 (or 1/4\\"=1'-0\\") whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:24 (or 1/2\\"=1'-0\\"). Site plans are often drawn at 1\\" = 20' (1:240) or 1\\" = 30' (1:360). In the metric system the ratios commonly are 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000 and 1:5000  Views and projections  Symbols used to define whether a projection is either Third Angle (right) or First Angle (left). Comparison of several types of graphical projection. Because plans represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane, the use of views or projections is crucial to the legibility of plans. Each projection is achieved by assuming a vantage point from which to see the place or object, and a type of projection. These projection types are: *Parallel projection **Orthographic projection ***Multiview projection, including: ****Plan view or floor plan view ****Elevation, usually a side view of an exterior ****Section, a view of the interior at a particular cutting plane ***Axonometric projection, including: ****Isometric projection ****Dimetric projection ****Trimetric projection **Oblique projection, and *Perspective projection, including: **One-point perspective **Two-point perspective **Three-point perspective  Planning approach  There is no universal standard for sheet order, however the following describes a common approach: * General Information : The first sheets in a set may include notes, assembly descriptions, a rendering of the project, or simply the project title. * Site : Site plans, including a key plan, appear before other plans and on smaller projects may be on the first sheet. A project could require a landscape plan, although this can be integrated with the site plan if the drawing remains clear. * Specific plans : Floor plans, starting with the lowest floor and ending with the roof plan usually appear near the beginning of the set. Further, for example, reflected Ceiling Plans (RCP)s showing ceiling layouts appear after the floor plans. * Elevations : Starting with the principal, or front elevation, all the building elevations appear after the plans. Smaller residential projects may display the elevations before the plans. Elevation details may appear on the same sheets as the building elevations. * Sections: Building sections that describe views cut through the entire building appear next, followed by wall sections, then detail sections. * Details: Details may appear on any of the previous sheets, or may be collected to appear on detail sheets. These details may include construction details that show how the components of the building fit together. These details may also include millwork drawings or other interior details. * Schedules: Many aspects of a building must be listed as schedules on larger projects. These include schedules for windows, doors, wall or floor finishes, hardware, landscaping elements, rooms, and areas. Where additional systems are complex and require many details for installation, specialized additional plan drawings may be used, such as: * Structural: While smaller projects may only show structural information on the plans and sections, larger projects have separate sheets describing the structure of the building. * Mechanical: Mechanical drawings show plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, or fire protection systems. * Electrical :Electrical plan drawings may include equipment and cable tray layout, lighting and power, grounding, telephone, local area network, special communications or signal systems, or a reflected lighting plan.

During the thirties, he worked with Kid Milton's band but was drafted into the US Navy during World War II. Upon demobilization, he worked internationally with the bands of Paul Barbarin and Kid Ory, later returning to New Orleans where he played with several of the well-known jazz and brass bands in the city. He was regularly seen at Preservation Hall and toured Australia with a band made up of Preservation Hall musicians.

The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy (a response to the problem of evil). It defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the best of all possible worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development. Second-century philosopher and theologian Irenaeus, after whom the theodicy is named, proposed a two-stage creation process in which humans require free will and the experience of evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, Origen, presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. Friedrich Schleiermacher argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God's purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher John Hick discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all \\"Irenaean\\". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher Richard Swinburne proposed that, to make a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices. The development of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited and that he cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth-century philosopher Alvin Plantinga opposed the idea that this is the best possible world, arguing that there could always be at least one more good person, in every possible world. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy. Outline The Irenaean theodicy was first identified as a form of theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it.Hall 2003, p. 132 The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.Svendsen & Pierce 2010, p. 15 Evidential problem of evil The Irenaean theodicy is a response to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.Svendsen 2010, p. 43 Creation and development of humans According to the Irenaean tradition, humans are not created perfectly, but in a state of imperfection.Svendsen & Pierce 2010, p. 51 The theodicy teaches that creation has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed.Engel, Soldan & Durand 2004, p. 214 The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world because this is the best way for humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the \\"soul-making theodicy\\", a phrase taken from the poet John Keats. Greatest possible world Typical to variations of the Irenaean theodicy is the notion that the present world is the greatest possible world, or the best of all possible worlds.Eriksen 1998, p. 447 This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.Ellwood & Alles 2006, p. 446 Development Irenaeus used the Biblical example of Jonah as someone whose suffering brought about a greater good Irenaeus Second-century philosopher Irenaeus developed a theodicy based on the idea that the creation of humans is still in progress.Davis 2001, pp. 40‚Äì42 He proposed that creation consists of two distinct parts: first in the image of God, then in the likeness of God. Irenaeus believed the first stage is complete, but the second stage requires humans to develop and grow into the likeness of God, a stage which Irenaeus believed is still in progress. He believed that, in order to achieve moral perfection, humans must be given free choice, with the actual possibility of choosing to do evil.Engel, Soldan & Durand 2007, p. 214 Irenaeus argued that for humans to have free will, God must be at an epistemic distance (or intellectual distance) from humans, far enough that belief in God remains a free choice.Davis 2001, p.41 As Irenaeus said, \\"there is no coercion with God, but a good will [towards us] is present with Him continually.\\" Because Irenaeus saw the purpose of the world to be the development of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.Irenaeus, Ch. God endured Jonah's absorption, man's long punishment. p. 284 Irenaeus' eschatology was based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation.Minns 2010, p. 144 He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem.Barber & Neville 2005, p. 82 The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.Bretherton 2011, Ch. 10 Origen Early Christian theologian Origen also presented suffering as necessary for the development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' and ought to be called an \\"Origenian theodicy\\". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an allegorical reading of Exodus and the books of Solomon, Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and our original nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of Adam and Eve, the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.Scott 2010, pp. 322-333 Friedrich Schleiermacher In the early 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote Speeches and The Christian Faith, proposing a theodicy which John Hick later identified as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, \\"God would create flawlessly\\". He proposed that it would be illogical for a perfect creation to go wrong (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason.Engel & Soldan 2008, p. 213 Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus as an example of a sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed.Bennett, Peters, Hewlett & Russell 2008, pp. 127‚Äì128 This theology led Schleiermacher to universalism, arguing that it is God's will for everyone to be saved and that no person could alter this.Hall 2003, pp. 21‚Äì22 John Hick John Hick published Evil and the God of Love in 1966, in which he developed a theodicy based on the work of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy.Geivett 1995, p. 29 Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation.Pojman & Rea 2011, p. 349 He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans. Hick used Irenaeus' notion of two-stage creation and supported the belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity.Davis 2001, pp. 40‚Äì41 Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if there is an element of mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.Scott 2010, p. 320 The value Hick placed on free will was the result of his belief that it is necessary for genuine love: he believed that love which is not freely chosen is valueless. A genuinely loving God, he argued, would have created humans with free will. Hick held that it would be possible for God to create beings that would always freely choose to do good, but argued that a genuine relationship requires the possibility of rejection.Cheetham 2003, pp. 48‚Äì49 Irenaeus' notion of humans existing at an \\"epistemic distance\\" from God also influenced Hick, as it would ensure a free choice in belief in God. Hick argued that a world without pain or suffering would prevent moral development; such a world would have no fixed structure, or have a structure subject to divine intervention, preventing humans from coming to any harm. Hick argued that this would leave humans unable to help or harm one another, allowing them no moral choices and so preventing moral development.Stump 1999, pp. 222‚Äì227 The nature of his theodicy required Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed that there would be no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.Hall 2003, p. 133 Richard Swinburne British philosopher Richard Swinburne proposed a version of the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent.Little 2005, p. 73 He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience‚ÄîSwinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability.Stump 1999, p. 155 Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in order to understand the consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering.Campbell & Wilkinson 2010, p. 181 Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment,Hall 2003, p. 76 and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.Hall 2003, p. 74 Reception=Process theology Process theologian David Ray Griffin contested \\"the utility of soul making\\" The development of process theology has presented a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. The doctrine proposes that God is benevolent but suggests that his power is restricted to persuasion, rather than coercion and so is unable to prevent certain evil events from occurring.Migliore 2004, p. 129 Process theology accepts God's indirect responsibility for evil, but maintains that he is blameless, and does everything in his power to bring about good.Melse 1993, pp. 13 In his introduction to process theology, C. Robert Melse argued that, although suffering does sometimes bring about good, not all suffering is valuable and that most does more harm than good.Melse 1993, pp. 18 Process theologian David Griffin contested \\"the utility of soul making\\". He argued that the Irenaean theodicy supposes that God inflicts pain for his own ends, which Griffin regarded as immoral.Thiselton 2005, pp. 131‚Äì133 D. Z. Phillips D. Z. Phillips argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced in the Holocaust cannot be justified by any apparent gains Philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips published The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God in 2004, presenting a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence.Wilkinson & Campbell 2010, p. 183 With reference to the suffering of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.Wilkinson & Campbell 2010, p. 183‚Äì184 Edward Feser, a Catholic philosopher, recalls that D. Z. Phillips critiqued the Irenaean theodicy in his classes, summarising its essence as, \\"Here you go, a bit of cancer should help toughen you up!\\"https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/12/unbroken-and-problem-of-evil.html Fyodor Dostoyevsky Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky presented a similar argument in his novel, The Brothers Karamazov. This is however not a final argument, given the nature of Dostoyevsky's work as polyphonic. In the novel, the character Ivan Karamazov presents an account of incredible cruelty to innocent people and children to his theist brother, Alyosha. Following this, Ivan asks his brother if he would, hypothetically, choose to be the architect of the eternal happiness of mankind, which would come into existence, if, and only if he would torture an innocent child, a necessary evil, after which this eternal happiness would come into existence.Aitfield 2006, p. 137 But Dostoyevsky's work, polyphonic in nature, also states that the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and in the face of evil, the beauty that will save the world. Michael Tooley Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley rejected the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well as people who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development. Henri Blocher French theologian Henri Blocher criticised the universalism of John Hick's theory. Blocher argued that universalism contradicts free will, which is vital to the Irenaean theodicy, because, if everyone will receive salvation, humans cannot choose to reject God. Hick did attempt to address this issue: he argued that a free action is one which reflects that character of a person, and that humans were created with a \\"Godward bias\\", so would choose salvation. Blocher proposed that Hick must then accept a level of determinism, though not going all the way.Blocher 2005, p. 52 ReferencesBibliography    See also * Augustinian theodicy * Theodicy * Theodicy and the Bible Category:Philosophy of religion Category:Theodicy Category:Problem of evil ","title":"Irenaean theodicy"},{"id":"10129226","text":"Say When!! is an American game show emceed by Art James which aired on NBC television from January 2, 1961, to March 26, 1965. The show was a Mark Goodson-Bill Todman production and James' only game show for them. Wayne Howell was the announcer, with occasional substitution by Roger Tuttle, Mel Brandt, and Fred Collins. The models alternatingly consisted of Ruth Halsey, Emily Banks, Gunilla Knutson, Carolyn White, Kristan Johnson, and Elizabeth Ames. Carmen Mastren was the show's music director. The series aired live in black and white (switching to color in mid-1964) from NBC Studio 6A at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York. Game play Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed. At the beginning of each game a dollar goal was revealed and four prizes were displayed. The contestants then took turns picking one prize at a time (when a prize was picked, another prize replaced it). Once picked, the dollar value of the prize was added to the contestant's total. The object for the players was to get closer to the goal than their opponent without going over. Once either player came within $250 of the goal she/he could \\"say when\\" (freeze), forcing the other to continue playing until she/he either won the game by beating the frozen total, or losing the game by exceeding the goal. One of the recurring prizes was the \\"Blank Check\\", which usually involved a grocery-related item. The contestant who chose it could select up to a certain amount of it times the product's individual cost. The individual price would then be revealed and multiplied, with its total then added to the contestant's score. (James' later game show Blank Check was not actually based on this \\"prize\\", but on adding digits to a four-digit cash prize.) A best-of-three match was played to determine the champion, with players keeping all prizes won outright. \\"Peter Pan\\" incident During one episode following the switch to color, James was doing a live commercial for Peter Pan peanut butter. The spot went normally until, as he had done several times during rehearsals for the spot, he dropped a table knife into the glass jar as he held it up; on this instance, however, the bottom of the jar broke and the knife fell out of the bottom. James continued the spot to laughter from the audience, which held as the bottom part of the jar (now a fully visible circle) came \\"unglued\\" from the peanut butter. \\"It's great peanut butter,\\" James said. \\"The jar is something else\\". He later said, \\"My mother told me there'd be days like this\\". Episode status Due to wiping, a run- through taped in December 1960 and an episode from 1961 are the only regular episodes in existence. The latter show was discovered in 2014 and uploaded to YouTube. In the 1960 run-through, the format was somewhat different: two games were played, and the winners of those games competed head-to-head; the goal in each game was $2,000. Both episodes were kept using the Kinescope format. The Peter Pan incident also exists, as a clip running just under two minutes (the episode of origin is believed to have been destroyed). A portion of this footage was used on both NBC's Most Outrageous Game Show Moments and VH1's Game Show Moments Gone Bananas; the full version is available for viewing on YouTube Buzzr aired an early episode of the program during it's 5th annual \\"Lostnfun\\" marathon on September 27, 2020.

The Club sponsors an annual convention and the National Postmark Museum in Bellevue, Ohio. The PMCC maintains the Post Office Directory, the most accurate list of Post Offices available. These listings detail postal operations in all 50 states, some Canadian provinces, and U.S. possessions. Each year the PMCC holds an annual Convention in a different part of the U.S. hosted by member(s) of the club, offering free postmarks, cachets, benefit auctions, exhibits, tours and more. The Post Mark Collectors Club is affiliate #62 of the American Philatelic Society (APS).The Post Mark Collectors Club Museum Pamphlet It held its 49th annual convention in New London, Connecticut on July 21, 2010. History The Post Mark Collectors Club (PMCC) began in 1941 by Charles Strobel of Cleveland, Ohio. However, World War II intervened and Mr. Strobel's health was poor, so the PMCC was reorganized in 1946 under the guidance of Rev. Walter Smith in Maine. By 1950, the Postal Cancellations Society (PCS), founded by Kenneth Rinker merged with PMCC.\\"Early History of PMCC\\", by Linda Barkley #1785L PMCC Bulletin, October 2006 In 1974, Herbert H. Harrington, then president of the club, wrote to several members of Congress to object to the removal of town names from canceled postage due to the introduction by the United States Postal Service of automated sorting and canceling machines, which he said were, \\"taking the romance out of post marks.\\" Slogan The slogan for PMCC, composed by Rev. Smith, had its earliest mention in the June 1950 Bulletin. It evolved in form and by September 1950, it appeared on the cover page of the bulletin for the first time: \\"Joyful In Joining...First In Friendliness...Happy In Helpfulness...Gladsome In The Golden Rule.\\" This slogan was considered the cornerstone of PMCC. Bulletin In October 1947, the PMCC Bulletin was first published by Rev. Smith and Robert K. Francis. The mimeographed issue was three pages long. The award-winning newsletter is published eleven times a year with news, photos and postmark collecting information. The current editor of the PMCC Bulletin is Bill German. Museum The start of the PMCC Museum, goes back to 1957. Margie Pfund of Columbiana, Ohio devoted a 7 foot by 10 foot room of her farmhouse for the museum. Pfund and her husband helped play an important role of the club. She, and her husband, Art, were the curators. Soon, they moved the PMCC Museum to a larger room in an added wing of the house. The Pfund's received help in the museum from nearby members. In 1963 the museum was dedicated as the Margie Pfund Memorial Postmark Museum and Library to honor the many hours she spent building PMCC enthusiasm and making the museum a success. Bernice Mittower was the museum curator from 1969 to 1994 and a cornerstone of the PMCC Museum for 25 years. She was a driving force behind its growth, moving the collection from a bus located on her farm to Historic Lyme Village in 1978. Its new home was the original Lyme Post Office, which had been relocated to Historic Lyme Village by the PMCC. In 1993 the museum collection was transferred again to the larger Groton Township building. The current home of the PMCC Museum was dedicated on October 23, 2003. This expansive space was built entirely with donations from PMCC members. The Museum's holdings make up the largest single Postmark collection in the world, grouping nearly two million different postal history items. The library contains reference material on postmark collecting from all 50 states, as well as from Canada and many other countries around the world. Along with postmarks and research materials, the Museum has a fine collection of vintage post office memorabilia. Special collections of postmark slogans, such as the \\"Pray for Peace\\" series are the highlights of the holdings. The museum is situated in Historic Lyme Village, just east of Bellevue, Ohio on State Road 4, near Route 113. The current curator of the museum is Gary Hendren.

Charles Hughes began football coaching in 1964 by being assistant coach to Allen Wade, he used the experience he gained from studying for a degree in physical education at Loughborough University. Hughes would later become the Director of Coaching for The Football Association and publish his book, The Winning Formula, which would be the basis of how English football would be played and coached for several decades. Tactics Hughes presented his ideas in the magazine Match Analysis and concluded most goals were scored from three passes or fewer, therefore it was important to get the ball quickly forward as soon as possible. He based this analysis on over one hundred games at all levels, including games involving Liverpool and the Brazilian national team, as well as many England youth games. His ideals were developed from those previously developed by World War II Wing Commander Charles Reep. From his statistical analysis, Hughes emphasised the importance of particular areas of the field from where goals were most often scored. He called these areas the 'POMO' ‚Äì Positions Of Maximum Opportunity ‚Äì and asserted that players would score if the ball was played into the 'POMO' enough times. He stressed the importance of set plays and crosses into the penalty area.

It was unknown to science until 1950, when it was collected by herpetologist W. T. Neill. It is rarely observed in the wild, and much about the species remains uncertain.  Description  The one-toed amphiuma is considered aquatic, and ranges in coloration from gray-black to purplish-brown. Unlike the other two Amphiuma species which have distinctively lighter undersides, one-toed amphiumas are the same color on both the dorsum (back) and the venter (belly). It can also be distinguished by its cone-shaped head and toe number‚Äîone-toed amphiumas have one toe on each foot as opposed to the two or three exhibited by other Amphiuma species. It is the smallest species in the genus Amphiuma with the average adult size being 8.5 inches (220 mm).  Distribution  One-toed amphiumas are generally known only to occur in parts of the Florida panhandle, extreme southern Georgia, and southern Alabama.  Behavior  One-toed amphiumas are active mostly at night, when they forage for invertebrate prey. Their habits are similar to that of the other members of its genus, preferring slow moving or stagnant, shallow water with either muddy bottoms or areas with weedy vegetation. They have a special affinity for the semi-fluid mud deposits that accumulate in the swampy floodplains of rivers and streams or along the edges of coastal spring-fed rivers. Like all amphiumas, one-toed amphiumas eat small, aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish, annelid worms, insect larvae, and occasionally fish or amphibian larvae. Its breeding habits are largely unknown and eggs and hatchlings have never been observed.Means, D.B. 1996. Amphiuma pholeter. Neill. Pp. 622.1‚Äì622.2. Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles.

The region is part of the Ring of Fire: the subduction of the Pacific and Farallon Plates under the North American Plate is responsible for many of the area's scenic features as well as some of its hazards, such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and landslides. The geology of the Pacific Northwest is vast and complex. Most of the region began forming about 200 million years ago as the North American Plate started to drift westward during the rifting of Pangaea. Since that date, the western edge of North America has grown westward as a succession of island arcs and assorted ocean-floor rocks have been added along the continental margin. There are at least five geologic provinces in the area: the Cascade Volcanoes, the Columbia Plateau, the North Cascades, the Coast Mountains, and the Insular Mountains. The Cascade Volcanoes are an active volcanic region along the western side of the Pacific Northwest. The Columbia Plateau is a region of subdued geography that is inland of the Cascade Volcanoes, and the North Cascades are a mountainous region in the northwest corner of the United States, extending into British Columbia. The Coast Mountains and Insular Mountains are a strip of mountains along the coast of British Columbia, each with its own geological history. Volcanoes=The Cascade Volcanoes The Cascades Province forms an arc-shaped band extending from southwestern British Columbia to Northern California, roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline. Within this region, nearly 20 major volcanic centers lie in sequence. Mount St. Helens erupts on May 18, 1980 Although the largest volcanoes like Mount St. Helens get the most attention, the Cascade Volcanic Arc includes a band of thousands of very small, short- lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes that dominate the landscape. The Cascade volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is also known for its frequent earthquakes. The volcanoes and earthquakes arise from a common source: subduction. Beneath the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a dense oceanic plate sinks beneath the North American Plate; a process known as subduction. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma ascends upward through the crust along a path of least resistance, both by way of fractures and faults as well as by melting wall rocks. The addition of melted crust changes the geochemical composition. Some of the melt rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Volcanic Arc) above the subduction zone. The addition of crustal melt to the original mantle melt results in volcanic and plutonic rocks that differ in mineralogy from the mantle source. A close-up look at the Cascades reveals a more complicated picture than a simple subduction zone. Not far off the coast of the North Pacific lies a spreading ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where melted mantle rises and freezes, creating new ocean crust. On one side of the spreading ridge new Pacific Plate crust is made, then moves away from the ridge. On the other side of the spreading ridge the Juan de Fuca and Gorda Plates move eastward. Image of the Juan de Fuca Plate that produced the magnitude 8.7‚Äì9.2 Cascadia earthquake in 1700. There are some unusual features at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca Plate sinks beneath the North American Plate there is no deep trench, seismicity (earthquakes) is less than expected, and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American Plates. These two plates converge at 3‚Äì4 centimeters per year at present. This is only about half the rate of convergence of 7 million years ago. The small Juan de Fuca Plate and two platelets, the Explorer Plate and Gorda Plate are the meager remnants of the much larger Farallon oceanic plate. The Explorer Plate broke away from the Juan de Fuca about 4 million years ago and shows no evidence that it is still being subducted. The Gorda platelet split away between 18 and 5 million years ago and continues to sink beneath North America. The Cascade Volcanic Arc made its first appearance 36 million years ago, but the major peaks that rise up from today's volcanic centers were born within the last 1.6 million years. More than 3,000 vents erupted during the most recent volcanic episode that began 5 million years ago. As long as subduction continues, new Cascade volcanoes will continue to rise. Volcanism outside the Cascades Map of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt centers. The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in southwestern British Columbia is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the United States and contains the most explosive young volcanoes in Canada. Like the rest of the arc, it has its origins in the Cascadia subduction zone. Volcanoes of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt have been sporadically active over a time span of several millions of years. The northernmost member, the Mount Meager massif, was responsible for a major catastrophic eruption that occurred about 2,350 years ago. This eruption may have been close in size to that of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Ash from this eruption can be traced eastward to western Alberta. It is also the most unstable volcanic massif in Canada, which has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Pemberton Valley at least three times during the past 7,300 years. Hot springs near the Mount Cayley and Mount Meager massifs suggest that magmatic heat is still present. The long history of volcanism in the region, coupled with continued subduction off the coast, suggests that volcanism has not yet ended in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. A few isolated volcanic centers northwest of the Mount Meager massif such as the Franklin Glacier Complex and the Silverthrone Caldera, which lie in the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, may also be the product of Cascadia subduction, but geologic investigations have been very limited in this remote region. About 5‚Äì7 million years ago, the northern end of the Juan de Fuca Plate broke off along the Nootka Fault to form the Explorer Plate, and there is no definitive consensus among geologists on the relation of the volcanoes north of that fault to the rest of the Cascade Arc. However, the Pemberton Volcanic Belt is usually merged with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, making Mount Silverthrone the northernmost, but an uncertain Cascadia subduction-related volcano. Mount Edziza, a large shield volcano in northwestern British Columbia The most active volcanic region of the northern Pacific Northwest is called the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province (sometimes called the Stikine Volcanic Belt). It contains more than 100 young volcanoes and several eruptions known to have occurred within the last 400 years. The last eruptions within the volcanic belt was about 150 years ago at The Volcano in the Iskut- Unuk River Cones volcanic field. The most voluminous and most persistent eruptive center within the belt and in Canada is Level Mountain. It is a large shield volcano that covers an area of southwest of Dease Lake and north of Telegraph Creek. The broad dissected summit region consists of trachytic and rhyolitic lava domes and was considered to be dotted with several minor basaltic vents of postglacial age, although considered Holocene activity to be uncertain. The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is perhaps the most spectacular volcanic edifice in British Columbia. It is the second largest persistent eruptive center within the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province and is flanked with numerous young satellite cones, including the young, well- preserved Eve Cone. There are some indications that Level Mountain and Mount Edziza volcanic complex may be between 11 and 9 million years old. Map of the Anahim Volcanic Belt centers. The Anahim Volcanic Belt is a volcanic belt that stretches from just north of Vancouver Island to near Quesnel. It is thought to have formed as a result of the North American Plate moving over a stationary hotspot, similar to the hotspot feeding the Hawaiian Islands, called the Anahim hotspot. The youngest volcano within the volcanic belt is Nazko Cone. It last erupted about 7,000 years ago, producing two small lava flows that traveled to the west, along with a blanket of volcanic ash that extends several km to the north and east of the cone. The volcanic belt also contains three large shield volcanoes that were formed between 8 and 1 million years ago, called the Ilgachuz Range, Rainbow Range and the Itcha Range. The Chilcotin Group in southern British Columbia is a north-south range of volcanoes, thought to have formed as a result of back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone. The majority of the eruptions in this belt happened either 6 to 10 million years ago (Miocene) or 2‚Äì3 million years ago (Pliocene). However, there have been few eruptions in the Pleistocene.Volcanoes of Canada-Map of Canadian volcanoes. Retrieved on 2007-06-24 The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field in south-eastern British Columbia consists of several small basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows that have been active for the past 3 million years.Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Wells Gray-Clearwater volcano field Retrieved on 2007-07-25 It is within the Wells Gray Provincial Park, which also includes the -high Helmcken Falls. The origin of the volcanism is unknown, but is probably related to crustal thinning. Some of the lava flows in the field are similar to those that erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon, where olivine nephelinite occurs. The last eruption in the field was about 400 years ago at Kostal Cone. Numerous seamounts lie off British Columbia's coast and are related to hotspot volcanism. The Bowie Seamount located west of the Queen Charlotte Islands, is perhaps the shallowest seamount in Canada's Pacific waters. Because of its shallow depth, scientists believe it was an active volcanic island throughout the last ice age. The Bowie Seamount is also the youngest seamount in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain. Volcanic disasters The last eruption of the Tseax Cone around the years 1750 or 1775 is Canada's worst known geophysical disaster. The eruption produced a long lava flow, destroying the Nisga'a villages and the death of at least 2000 Nisga'a people by volcanic gases and poisonous smoke. The Nass River valley was inundated by the lava flows and contain abundant tree molds and lava tubes. The event coincided with the arrival of the first European explorers to penetrate the uncharted coastal waters of northern British Columbia. Today, the basaltic lava deposits are a draw to tourists and are part of the Nisga'a Memorial Lava Beds Provincial Park. Recent volcanic activity Lava Butte, Oregon, erupted roughly 5000 years BCE The Pacific Northwest volcanoes continue to be a geologically active area. The most geologically recent volcanic eruptions include: * Level Mountain, Canada's most voluminous and most persistent eruptive center, might have erupted in the Holocene. * Nazko Cone, the youngest volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, erupted 7200 BP. * Hoodoo Mountain erupted 7050 BP. * Lava Butte, Oregon erupted about 7,000 years ago. * Mount Mazama, which erupted catastrophically in 5670 BCE to form Crater Lake. * Mount Meager massif erupted about 2350 BP, sending an ash column high into the stratosphere. * Mount Edziza volcanic complex, Canada's second largest eruptive center, erupted about 1340 BP. * Medicine Lake Volcano erupted about 1000 BP. * Silverthrone Caldera might have eruptions younger than 1000 BP. * Kostal Cone in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field might have erupted and formed in 1500 based on tree-ring dating. * Glacier Peak erupted in the 17th or 18th century. * Tseax Cone erupted in the 18th century. * Mount Hood erupted in 1781‚Äì82; fumaroles on the summit still spew sulfurous gas. * Mount Shasta erupted in 1786. * The Volcano erupted about 150 BP, producing a long lava flow. * Mount Rainier erupted 1854. * Mount Baker erupted in 1880; fumaroles still occur at its summit. * Ruby Mountain might have erupted in 1898. * Lassen Peak erupted in 1914-5. * Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, killing 57 people. (see 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens). Seismic activity State Route 302 after the Nisqually earthquake The Pacific Northwest is seismically active. The Juan de Fuca Plate is capable of producing megathrust earthquakes of moment magnitude 9: the last such earthquake was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, which produced a tsunami in Japan, and may have temporarily blocked the Columbia River with the Bonneville Slide. More recently, in 2001, the Nisqually earthquake (magnitude 6.8) struck northeast of Olympia, Washington, causing some structural damage and panic. In addition, eleven volcanoes in Canada have had seismic activity since 1975, including: the Silverthrone Caldera, Mount Meager massif, Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley massif, Castle Rock, The Volcano, Mount Edziza volcanic complex, Hoodoo Mountain, Crow Lagoon and Nazko Cone. Columbia Plateau The Columbia River basalts cover portions of three states The Columbia Plateau province is enveloped by one of the world's largest accumulations of basalt. Over of the Earth's surface is covered by it. The topography here is dominated by geologically young lava flows that inundated the countryside with amazing speed, all within the last 17 million years. Over of basaltic lava, known as the Columbia River Basalt Group, covers the western part of the province. These tremendous flows erupted between 17‚Äì6 million years ago. Most of the lava flooded out in the first 1.5 million years: an extraordinarily short time for such an outpouring of molten rock. The Snake River Plain stretches across Oregon, through northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and ends at the Yellowstone Plateau in Wyoming. Looking like a great spoon scooped out the Earth surface, the smooth topography of this province forms a striking contrast with the strong mountainous fabric around it. The Snake River Plain lies in a distinct depression. At the western end, the base has dropped down along normal faults, forming a graben structure. Although there is extensive faulting at the eastern end, the structure is not as clear. A map of the Snake River Plain, showing its smooth topography Like the Columbia River region, volcanic eruptions dominate the story of the Snake River Plain in the eastern part of the Columbia Plateau Province. The earliest Snake River Plain eruptions began about 15 million years ago, just as the tremendous early eruptions of Columbia River Basalt were ending. But most of the Snake River Plain volcanic rock is less than a few million years old, Pliocene age (5-1.6 million years ago) and younger. In the west, the Columbia River Basalts are just that: almost exclusively black basalt. Not so in the Snake River Plain, where relatively quiet eruptions of soupy black basalt lava flows alternated with tremendous explosive eruptions of rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock. Cinder cones dot the landscape of the Snake River Plain. Some are aligned along vents, the fissures that fed flows and cone-building eruptions. Calderas, great pits formed by explosive volcanism, and low shield volcanoes, and rhyolite hills are also part of the landscape here, but many are obscured by later lava flows. Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. At the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth's moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau, and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas. Although scientists are still gathering evidence, a probable explanation is that a hot spot, an extremely hot plume of deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. Geologists know that beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at the boundary between the core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth. When the hot plume arrives at the base of the lithosphere, some of the lighter rock of the lithosphere rapidly melts. It is this molten lithosphere that becomes the basalt lavas that gush onto the surface to form the Columbia River and Snake River Plain basalts. The track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to Yellowstone National Park. The steaming fumaroles and explosive geysers are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hotspot is probably quite stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a superb record of the rate and direction of plate motion. The Ice Age floods With the beginning of the Pleistocene time (about one million years ago), cooling temperatures provided conditions favorable for the creation of continental glaciers. Over the centuries, as snowfall exceeded melting and evaporation, a great accumulation of snow covered part of the continent, forming extensive ice fields. This vast continental ice sheet reached a thickness of about in some areas. Sufficient pressure on the ice caused it to flow outward as a glacier. The glacier moved south out of Canada, damming rivers and creating lakes in Washington, Idaho and Montana. The ice blocked the Clark Fork River, forming the huge Glacial Lake Missoula. The lake measured about and contained about , half the volume of Lake Michigan. The immense floods created channels that are presently dry, such as the Drumheller Channels Glacial Lake Missoula eventually broke through the ice dam, allowing a tremendous volume of water to rush across northern Idaho and into eastern Washington. Such catastrophic floods raced across the southward-dipping plateau a number of times, etching the coulees which characterize this region, now known as the channeled scablands. As the floods in this vicinity raced southward, two major cascades formed along their course. The larger cataract was that of the upper Grand Coulee, where the river roared over an waterfall. The eroding power of the water plucked pieces of basalt from the precipice, causing the falls to retreat and self-destruct by cutting through to the Columbia River valley near what is now the Grand Coulee Dam. The other major cataract is now known as Dry Falls. It started near Soap Lake in Washington State, where less resistant basalt layers gave way before the great erosive power of this tremendous torrent and waterfalls developed. As in the upper Grand Coulee, the raging river yanked chunks of rock from the face of the falls and the falls eventually retreated to their present location. Dry Falls is wide, with a drop of more than . By way of comparison, Niagara Falls, wide with a drop of only , would be dwarfed by Dry Falls. The North Cascades The North Cascade Range in Washington is part of the American cordillera, a mountain chain stretching more than from Tierra del Fuego to the Alaska Peninsula, and second only to the Alpine-Himalayan chain in height. Although only a small part of the Cordillera, mile for mile, the North Cascade Range is steeper and wetter than most other ranges in the conterminous United States. In geology, the range has more in common with the Coast Ranges of British Columbia and Alaska than it does with its Cordilleran cousins in the Rocky Mountains or Sierra Nevada. Although the peaks of the North Cascades do not reach great elevations (high peaks are generally in the range, their overall relief, the relatively uninterrupted vertical distance from valley bottom to mountain top, is commonly . Rocks of the North Cascades record at least 400 million years of history. The record of this long history can be read in the many rock layers deposited over time through the forces of erosion, volcanic activity and plate subduction. These different forces have made a geologic mosaic made up of volcanic island arcs, deep ocean sediments, basaltic ocean floor, parts of old continents, submarine fans, and even pieces of the deep subcrustal mantle of the earth. The disparate pieces of the North Cascade mosaic were born far from one another but subsequently drifted together, carried along by the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's outer shell or were uplifted, eroded by streams, and then locally buried in their own eroded debris; other pieces were forced deep into the Earth to be heated and squeezed, almost beyond recognition, and then raised again to view. Over time, the moving plates eventually accreted the various pieces of the mosaic onto the western side of North America. About 35 million years ago, a volcanic arc grew across this complex mosaic of old terranes. Volcanoes erupted to cover the older rocks with lava and ash. Large masses of molten rock invaded the older rocks from below. The volcanic arc is still active today, decorating the skyline with the cones of Mount Baker and Glacier Peak. The North Cascades are heavily eroded by glaciers The deep canyons and sharp peaks of today's North Cascades scene are products of profound erosion. Running water has etched out the grain of the range, landslides have softened the abrupt edges, homegrown glaciers have scoured the peaks and high valleys and, during the Ice Age, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet overrode almost all the range and rearranged courses of streams. Erosion has written and still writes its own history in the mountains, but it has also revealed the complex mosaic of the bedrock. Coast Mountains The Coast Mountains are the western range of the North American mainland cordillera, covering the Alaska Panhandle and most of coastal British Columbia. The range is approximately long and wide. Most of the Coast Mountains are composed of granite, which is part of the Coast Plutonic Complex. This is the single largest contiguous granite outcropping in the world, which extends approximately in length. It is a large batholith complex. Its formation is related to subduction of the Kula and Farallon tectonic plates along the continental margin during the Jurassic-to-Eocene periods. The plutonic complex is built on unusual island arc fragments, oceanic plateaus and continental margin assemblages accreted between the Triassic and the Cretaceous periods.U-Pb dates from the Scotia-Quaal metamorphic belt, Coast Plutonic Complex, central-western British Columbia Retrieved on 2007-12-02 In addition, the Garibaldi, Meager, Cayley and Silverthrone areas are of recent volcanic origin. The Coast Mountains are heavily eroded by glaciers, including Mount Waddington (far background, center). The Coast Mountains consist of a single uplifted mass. During the Pliocene period the Coast Mountains did not exist and a level peneplain extended to the sea. This mass was uplifted during the Miocene period. Rivers such as the Klinaklini River and Homathko River predate this uplift and due to erosion occurring faster than uplift, have continued to flow right up to the present day, directly across the axis of the range. The mountains flanking the Homathko River are the highest in the Coast Mountains, and include Mount Waddington west of the river in the Waddington Range and Mount Queen Bess east of the river, adjacent to the Homathko Icefield. The Pacific Ranges in southwestern British Columbia are the southernmost subdivision of the Coast Mountains. It has been characterized by rapid rates of uplift over the past 4 million years unlike the North Cascades and has led to relatively high rates of erosion. Insular Mountains The Insular Mountains on the coast of British Columbia have not yet fully emerged above sea level, and Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii are just the higher elevations of the range, which was in fact fully exposed during the last ice age when the continental shelf in this area was a broad coastal plain. Although the Coast Mountains are commonly considered to be the westernmost range of the American cordillera, the Insular Mountains are the true westernmost range.Coast Mountains in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2007-12-02 Through the most recent ice age about 18,000 years ago, ice enclosed nearly all of the mountains. Glaciers that ran down to the Pacific Ocean sharpened the valley faces and eroded their bottoms. The Golden Hinde on Vancouver Island was formed by erosion carving into basalt. The Insular Mountains were formed when a large island arc, called the Insular Islands, collided against North America during the Mid-Cretaceous period. The mountains are made of turbidite and pillow lavas unlike the plutons of the Coast Plutonic Complex that make the Coast Mountains. The Insular Mountains have much seismic activity, with the Juan de Fuca Plate subducting at the Cascadia subduction zone and the Pacific Plate sliding along the Queen Charlotte Fault. Large earthquakes have led to collapsing mountains, landslides, and the development of fissures.Insular Mountains in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2007-12-02 Flood basalts on Vancouver Island form a geologic formation called the Karmutsen Formation, which is perhaps the thickest accreted section of an oceanic plateau worldwide, exposing up to of basal sediment-sill complexes, basaltic to picritic pillow lavas, pillow breccia, and thick, massive basalt flows.

Furuseth was active in the formation of two influential maritime unions: the Sailors' Union of the Pacific and the International Seamen's Union, and served as the executive of both for decades. Furuseth was largely responsible for the passage of four reforms that changed the lives of American mariners. Two of them, the Maguire Act of 1895 and the White Act of 1898, ended corporal punishment and abolished imprisonment for deserting a vessel. Furuseth was credited as the key figure behind drafting and enacting the Seamen's Act of 1915, hailed by many as \\"The Magna Carta of the Sea\\" and the Jones Act of 1920 which governs the workers' compensation rights of sailors and the use of foreign vessels in domestic trade. In his later years, he was known as \\"the Old Viking.\\"Newell, Gordon R., ed. H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at page 39, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Furuseth was also a founding member of the xenophobic organization Asiatic Exclusion League in May 1905. Family and early years Furuseth was born Anders Andreassen Nilsen, the fifth child of Andreas and Marthe Nielsen. The family had recently moved to a cottage in Furuseth, which lies in what is now the municipality of Stange. In accordance with local custom, the boy was named after his residence. In 1855, the family moved to Damstuen where the elder Nilsen took a low-paying job working at a dam. Five more children were born, causing the family financial distress. At age eight, Furuseth was sent to work for a farmer, Jonas S. Schjotz in nearby Ostby, Romedal. Schjotz, noticing the young Furuseth's keen mind, sent him to a private Lutheran school. On June 2, 1870, Furuseth moved to Oslo (then Christiania). He worked as a clerk and attempted to enter a military academy. Although he was ultimately unsuccessful in this bid, he did develop skills with the English, German, Dutch and French languages, which not only brought him employment at the time but would become very useful later in his life. Career at sea Furuseth started his career sailing on a barque out of Drammen, Norway.Furuseth went to sea in 1873 and sailed aboard ships under the Norwegian, Swedish, British, and American flags until coming ashore in San Francisco, California, in August 1880. He briefly pursued a career in the fishing industry near Portland, Oregon. Work in the Coast Seamen's Union The Coast Seamen's Union was formed while Furuseth was at sea, but he joined within three months of its formation, on June 3, 1885. Less than two years later, in January 1887, he was elected to the union's highest office: the secretary-treasurer. In 1889 he returned to sea but was reelected to the position of union secretary in 1891. It was during this term on July 29, 1891, that Furuseth merged the Coast Seamen's Union with the Steamship Sailor's Union to create the Sailors' Union of the Pacific, a union which is still active today. With the exception of a two-month period when he shipped out as a fisherman, he was the head of the SUP until 1935. Furuseth was an important backer of the successful legislation known as the White Act of 1898, which among other things abolished corporal punishment on American-flag ships and abolished imprisonment for desertion in American ports.McCurdy, at 39 Together with Walter MacArthur, secretary of the Coast Seamen's Union, Furuseth compiled and published the so-called \\"Red Record\\", an inventory of the various brutalities and oppressions practiced upon seamen by officers and shoreside thugs. One of many examples was in 1897, when the British four-masted ship Gifford was lying at Port Townsend, Washington, about to depart to round Cape Horn. Her master contracted with the keeper of a Tacoma boarding house to recruit sailors for the voyage. The boarding house keeper tricked the sailors into boarding the Gifford with promises of shore leave afterwards. The ship's mates locked them on board, paid the boarding house keeper $40 per man, which they then deducted from the men's salaries (on the false claim that they owed the money to the keeper). When the men refused to work, the ship's officers cut off food and water until they gave in. Beatings and other inhumane treatment were also common in other cases, and continued well after the supposed abolition of such brutality.McCurdy, at 23 and 93 Less than a year after the birth of the ISU, Furuseth was involved in a meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in which a federation of maritime unions called the \\"National Union of Seamen of America\\" was created. In 1895, this federation affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and was renamed the \\"International Seamen's Union of America\\" or (ISU). Furuseth was chosen as the ISU's president in 1897 and served in this position until 1899. He took part in the founding meeting of the Asiatic Exclusion League in May 1905, which was almost immediately successful in pressuring the San Francisco Board of Education to segregate Asian school children. In 1908, he was again elected to the ISU's presidency and served in that office until 1938. The Seamen's Act of 1915 Senator La Follette (center), and muckraker Lincoln Steffens, c. 1915. It was during this period, that Furuseth successfully pushed for legislative reforms that eventually became the Seamen's Act of 1915. The act was hailed by many as the \\"Magna Carta of the Sea,\\" and was sponsored in the United States Senate by Senator \\"Fightin' Bob\\" La Follette. The measure also received had significant support from then Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson. The Act promoted the living and working conditions of seamen serving in the United States Merchant Marine, specifically applying to vessels in excess of 100 gross tons. It fundamentally changed the life of the American sailor. Among other things, it: #abolished the practice of imprisonment for seamen who deserted their ship #reduced the penalties for disobedience #regulated a seaman's working hours both at sea and in port #established a minimum quality for ship's food #regulated the payment of seamen's wages #required specific levels of safety, particularly the provision of lifeboats #required a minimum percentage of the seamen aboard a vessel to be qualified Able Seamen #required a minimum of 75% of the seamen aboard a vessel to understand the language spoken by the officers Later life A monument was erected to Furuseth at San Francisco Embarcadero on September 1, 1942. It was later moved to make way for a highway.Furuseth's presidency of the ISU was at a turbulent time in the American shipping industry. The unions within the ISU faced \\"continual changeover in the makeup and leadership,\\" and weathered the historical periods of the Great Depression and World War I. Select periods were beneficial, including during World War I when a shipping boom and ISU's membership included more than 115,000 dues-paying members. The strike of 1919 was a great success for Furuseth, resulting in the highest peacetime wages ever for deep sea sailors. However failures followed close behind. When the World War I shipping boom ended, the ISU shrunk to only 50,000 dues-paying members. After a round of failed contract negotiations, ISU issued an all-ports strike on May 1, 1921. The strike lasted only two months, failed, and resulted in wage cuts of 25%. ISU also suffered a tremendous blow with the loss of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific in 1934. Furuseth charged that \\"radicals\\" from the Industrial Workers of the World were infiltrating the SUP and demanded they cease activities with the Maritime Federation. The SUP refused and Furuseth revoked their charter. In 1934, Furuseth was involved San Francisco's longshoremen's strike. Furuseth had lived in San Francisco's Embarcadero for 40 years, and was concerned the strike could lead to the kind of violence experienced in the recent Auto-Lite and the Minneapolis Teamsters strikes. He unsuccessfully attempted to mediate, pleading \\"With confidence and justice we can settle this strike within 24 hours and without bloodshed. Men, let's get together while there is still time. The only thing in the way of peace now is distrust, one group of the other.\\" The strike led to the unionization of all West Coast ports of the United States. Furuseth died on January 22, 1938. His body was placed in state at the Department of Labor. He was the first labor leader honored in this way. A ceremony was held, including seventy-one honorary pall bearers, including the \\"Secretary of Labor, nine members of the House of Representatives, seven United States Senators, two Supreme Court Justices, and a representative of Norway.\\" Longtime friend Senator Robert La Follette gave the eulogy. He had attended every meeting of the American Federation of Labor since Grover Cleveland's administration. He never took a salary higher than the men he represented.McCurdy, at 467 Furuseth's body was cremated and his ashes scattered on March 21, 1938, aboard the SS Schoharoe in the mid-Atlantic, \\"as far from land as possible,\\" according to his own request. The ship's master, before the assembled crew, said, \\"Fellow shipmates, we are assembled here to execute the wish to (sic.) Andrew Furuseth, venerable man, an unselfish worker for the betterment of seamen, who through legal means has done more to secure improved conditions under which you can work than any other man.\\" Memorials * The Sailors' Union of the Pacific established Andrew Furuseth School of Seamanship. * There is a monument to Furuseth in √Ösbygda, Norway * There is a monument to Furuseth outside the entrance to the Sailors' Union of the Pacific Hall in San Francisco, California. Inscribed on it is the \\"Furuseth Credo\\": \\"You can put me in jail. But you cannot give me narrower quarters than as a seaman I have always had. You cannot give me coarser food than I have always eaten. You cannot make me lonelier than I have always been.\\" The monument was originally placed at the Ferry building during the mayoralty of Angelo Rossi, it was later moved. * The Andrew Furseth Memorial Bust is at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. * The liberty ship was named after Furuseth.

Phase I trials of interactions with other drugs used in cancer treatment were also undertaken. On February 27, 2008, AstraZeneca announced that the use of cediranib in non-small cell lung cancer will not progress into phase III after failing to meet its main goal. On 8 March 2010, AstraZeneca issued a press-release stating that cediranib had failed Phase III clinical trials for use in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer when it was compared clinically with the market-leader bevacizumab. In 2016, AstraZeneca completed a phase III trial comparing the efficacy of cediranib alone and cediranib with lomustine to the efficacy of lomustine alone in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The trial failed to meet its primary endpoint and survival was not extended with cediranib. Combination trials Findings from a federally funded, NCI-sponsored phase II clinical trial presented at the 50th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (May 30 - June 3, 2014, Chicago, Ill; Abstract No: LBA5500), show that the combination of two investigational oral drugs, olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, and cediranib is significantly more active against recurrent, platinum chemotherapy-sensitive disease or ovarian cancer related to mutations in BRCA genes than olaparib alone.

Comstock, circa 1905 Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills was one of the most successful and enduring products to be manufactured and marketed in North America as part of the lucrative patent medicine industry, which thrived during most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Its manufacturer claimed the pills contained herbal ingredients that would help \\"cleanse the blood,\\" as \\"impurity of the blood\\" was believed to be the cause of all disease. History Advertisement for Dr Morse's Indian Root Pills near Morpeth, New South Wales, Australia Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills have their genesis with the father of William Henry Comstock, Edwin Perkins Comstock (1799‚Äì1837) who founded a drug company in New York City sometime before 1833. The Comstock patent medicine business was involved in the sale of a number of successful drugs, including Carlton's Pile Liniment, Oldridge's Balm of Columbia, Kline's Tooth Ache Drops and Judson's Worm Tea. Between 1833 and the time of the acquisition of the rights to Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills, the company remained under the control of the Comstocks through the additional involvement of Edwin's four brothers: # Lucius Samuel Comstock, (1806‚Äì1876) # Albert Lee Comstock (1802‚Äì1876) # John Carlton Comstock (1819‚Äì1853) # George Wells Comstock (1820‚Äì1889) The Indian Root Pills were first formulated and manufactured in 1854 by Andrew B. Moore (born around 1821, New York), who was then operating under the name A.B. Moore in Buffalo, New York. Rights to the pills were then transferred through a number of different business partnerships under the control of Moore involving: # Andrew Judson White, MD (1824‚Äì1898) ‚Äî paternal uncle of publisher and poet James Terry White (1845‚Äì1920) # Baldwin Lake Judson (1832‚Äì1867), son of Edwin's sister # George Wells Comstock # William Henry Comstock These reorganizations all occurred amid numerous disputes and lawsuits. During that long period of instability, the manufacturing operations moved from Buffalo to New York City and then to dual sites on opposite sides of the St. Lawrence River, one at Brockville, Ontario, and the other at Morristown, New York. Ownership of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills finally stabilized in 1867 when it settled solely in the hands of William Henry Comstock, and thereafter business was carried out under the name W.H. Comstock Co. Ltd. When William Henry Comstock died in 1919, control of the company passed to his son, William Henry Comstock II (1897‚Äì1959), known as \\"Young Bill.\\" A year after William Henry Comstock II died, his widow liquidated the company, selling the assets and patents to Milburn Medicine Company.Brockville: The River City, by Russ Disotell, Natural Heritage Books (1997) The subsidiary in Australia ‚Äî W.H.

He was a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic soccer team and earned one cap with the U.S. national team in 1984. He spent his entire professional career playing indoor soccer. Playing career=High school and college Swanner attended Southwest High School in St. Louis. After graduating from high school, Swanner attended Clemson University, where he played as a goalkeeper on the men's soccer team. In 1983, his senior season, he earned first-team All-American honors and was named the ISAA Goalkeeper of the Year. He also lettered in baseball at Clemson in 1983.Clemson Statistics National and Olympic teams Swanner represented the U.S. at the 1983 Pan American Games, playing in a 1‚Äì2 first round loss to Chile and joined the U.S. Olympic soccer team as it prepared for the 1984 Summer Olympics. Swanner earned his only cap with the U.S. national team when he came on for Winston DuBose in a December 2 tie with Ecuador. Professional When Swanner expressed his intentions to enter the pros, the Canton Invaders of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA) drafted him in the first round. Swanner immediately became a prominent indoor goalkeeper, winning Rookie of the Year for the 1985‚Äì86 season. Swanner would be named the AISA Goalkeeper of the Year for the 1986‚Äì87, 1988‚Äì89, 1989‚Äì90, 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92 seasons. He was also named to the All AISA team in 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. He was also the league MVP for 1989‚Äì90 and 1991‚Äì92. While playing with the Invaders, the AISA was renamed as the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) in 1990. During his seven seasons with the Invaders, the team won four championships. Despite Swanner's amazing success with the Invaders, he left the team at the end of the 1991‚Äì1992 season to join the Buffalo Blizzard of the NPSL. Swanner failed to achieve the same level of success with the Blizzard as he had with the Invaders. However, he remained with the Blizzard for only two seasons before moving to the St. Louis Ambush in 1994 for the next six seasons. The move to St. Louis saw a resurgence for Swanner as he was named All NPSL in 1995 and was the NPSL Goalkeeper of the Year for the 1994‚Äì95 season. Swanner won yet another championship as the Ambush swept the Harrisburg Heat four games to none in the NPSL championship series. In 1999, Swanner replaced Daryl Doran as the head coach of the Ambush. While he had not intended to continue playing, he was forced into that role when the team's goalkeeper was injured. The Ambush folded at the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season and Swanner moved to the Kansas City Attack to play as a goalkeeper, but saw little playing time and retired at the end of the season. When Swanner finished his time in professional soccer, he topped the AISA/NPSL career list with 296 wins & 10 shutouts. Other notable career stats: scored 9 goals and 98 assists (as a Goalkeeper) In November 2008, Swanner came out of retirement when he installed himself as a goalkeeper on the St. Louis Illusion of the Professional Arena Soccer League. Swanner is the owner of the Illusion.Swanner purchases Illusion Coaching While Swanner had spent a year as a professional coach with the Ambush in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, that was not his first coaching experience.

Wartime damage, the inability to maintain a labor force without slavery, and miserable weather had a disastrous effect on agricultural production. The state's chief cash crop, cotton, fell from a high of more than 700,000 bales in 1860 to less than 50,000 in 1865, while harvests of corn and wheat were also meager.\\"Reconstruction in Georgia\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia. The state government subsidized construction of numerous new railroad lines. White farmers turned to cotton as a cash crop, often using commercial fertilizers to make up for the poor soils they owned. The coastal rice plantations never recovered from the war. Bartow County was representative of the postwar difficulties. Property destruction and the deaths of a third of the soldiers caused financial and social crises; recovery was delayed by repeated crop failures. The Freedmen's Bureau agents were unable to give blacks the help they needed.Keith S. H√©bert, \\"The Bitter Trial of Defeat and Emancipation: Reconstruction in Bartow County, Georgia, 1865-1872,\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly (2008) 92#1 pp 65-92 Wartime Reconstruction, or \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" At the beginning of Reconstruction, Georgia had over 460,000 freedmen.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Reconstruction in Georgia In January 1865, in Savannah, William T. Sherman issued Special Field Orders, No. 15, authorizing federal authorities to confiscate abandoned plantation lands in the Sea Islands, whose owners had fled with the advance of his army, and redistribute them to former slaves. Redistributing 400,000 acres (1,600 km¬≤) in coastal Georgia and South Carolina to 40,000 freed slaves in forty-acre plots, this order was intended to provide for the thousands of escaped slaves who had been following his army during his March to the Sea.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Sherman's Field Order No. 15 Shortly after Sherman issued his order, Congressional leaders convinced President Lincoln to establish the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in March 1865. The Freedmen's Bureau, as it came to be called, was authorized to give legal title for plots of land to freedmen and white Southern Unionists. Rev. Tunis Campbell, a free Northern black missionary, was appointed to supervise land claims and resettlement in Georgia. Over the objections of Freedmen's Bureau chief General Oliver O. Howard, President Andrew Johnson revoked Sherman's directive in the fall of 1865, after the war had ended, returning these lands to the planters who had previously owned them, and expelling their new Black farmers. Presidential Reconstruction On Georgia's farms and plantations, wartime destruction, the inability to maintain a labor force without slavery, and miserable weather had a disastrous effect on agricultural production and the regional economy. The state's chief money crop, cotton, fell from a high of more than 700,000 bales in 1860 to less than 50,000 in 1865, while harvests of corn and wheat were also meager. After the war, new railroad lines and commercial fertilizers created conditions that spurred increased cotton production in Georgia's upcountry, but coastal rice plantations never recovered. Many emancipated slaves flocked to towns, where they encountered overcrowding and food shortages, with significant numbers dying from epidemic diseases. The Freedmens Bureau returned much of the prewar black labor back to the field, mediating a contract-labor system between white landowners and their black workers, who often consisted of the landowners' former slaves. Taking advantage of educational opportunities available for the first time, within a year, at least 8,000 former slaves were attending schools in Georgia, established with northern philanthropy.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Freedmen's Education during Reconstruction In mid-June 1865, Andrew Johnson appointed as provisional governor his friend and fellow Unionist, James Johnson, a Columbus lawyer who sat out the war. Delegates to a constitutional convention, meeting in Milledgeville in October, abolished slavery, repealed the Ordinance of Secession, and repudiated the Confederacy debt. The General Assembly, while alone among ex-Confederate states in refraining from enacting a harsh Black Code, assumed newly freed slaves would enjoy only the limited freedom of the prewar period's 'free persons of color,' and enacted a constitutional amendment outlawing interracial marriage. On November 15, 1865, Georgia elected a new governor, congressmen, and state legislators. Voters repudiated most Unionist candidates, electing to office many ex-Confederates, although several of these ‚Äì including the new governor, former Whig Charles J. Jenkins ‚Äì initially opposed secession. The new state legislature created a political firestorm in Washington by electing to the Senate Alexander Stephens and Herschel Johnson, who had been the Vice-President and a Senator of the Confederacy, respectively. Neither Stephens or Johnson, nor any of Georgia's newly-selected U.S. House delegation, were inaugurated or allowed to take their seats, as the federal government, at the time, refused to accept into the congregation persons implicated so heavily with the Confederacy's secession and rebellion, or to enable them to wield federal-level political influence. Congressional Reconstruction Andrew Johnson's decision in August 1866 to restore the former Confederate states to the Union was criticized by the Radical Republicans in Congress, who, in March 1867, passed the First Reconstruction Act, placing the South under military occupation. Georgia, along with Alabama and Florida, became part of the Third Military District, under the command of General John Pope. Radical Republicans also passed an ironclad oath which prevented ex-Confederates from voting or holding office, replacing them with a coalition of freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags, mostly former Whigs who had opposed secession. Thomas Nash political cartoon, \\"Worse than Slavery\\", depicting the subjugation of Blacks by the Ku Klux Klan and the White League. Note the lynching victim in upper left of shield. As directed by Congress, General John Pope registered Georgia's eligible white and black voters, 95,214 and 93,457 respectively. From October 29 through November 2, 1867, elections were held for delegates to a new constitutional convention, held in Atlanta rather than the state capital of Milledgeville, to prevent the interference of the ex-Confederates. In January 1868, after Georgia's first elected governor after the end of the war, Charles Jenkins, refused to authorize state funds for the racially integrated state constitutional convention, his government was dissolved by Pope's successor General George Meade and replaced by a military governor. This coup galvanized white resistance to the Reconstruction, fueling the growth of the Ku Klux Klan. Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest visited Atlanta several times in early 1868 to help set up the organization. In Georgia, the Klan was led by John Brown Gordon, a charismatic General in Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Freedmen's Bureau agents reported 336 cases of murder or assault with intent to kill against freedmen across the state from January 1 through November 15 of 1868.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstruction Era In July 1868, Georgia was readmitted to the Union, the newly elected General Assembly ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, and a Republican governor, New York native Rufus Bullock, was inaugurated. The state's Democrats‚Äîincluding former Confederate leaders Robert Toombs and Howell Cobb‚Äîdenounced the policies of the Reconstruction in a mass rally in Atlanta, described as the largest in the state's history. The principal target of the rally, Joseph E. Brown, Georgia's Governor under the Confederacy, who became a Republican and a delegate to the Chicago convention that had nominated Union general Ulysses S. Grant for president, declared that although the state, reluctantly, had given Blacks the vote, as they were not citizens the state's constitution did not allow them to hold office. In September, white Republicans joined with the Democrats in expelling the Black senators and Black representatives in the lower house from the General Assembly. While Governor Bullock gave the figure of 28, the monument Expelled Because of Their Color, on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, identifies 33. A week later, in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla, white residents attacked a black Republican rally, killing twelve people in the Camilla massacre. These developments led to calls for Georgia's return to military rule, which increased after Georgia was one of only two ex-Confederate states to vote against Grant in the election of 1868. (Louisiana was the other; Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia did not vote because they had not yet been readmitted to the Union.) The expelled black legislators, led by Rev. Tunis Campbell and Henry McNeill Turner, lobbied in Washington for federal intervention. In March 1869 Governor Bullock, hoping to prolong Reconstruction, \\"engineered\\" Georgia's refusalto ratify the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave Blacks the vote. The same month the U.S. Congress once again barred Georgia's representatives from their seats, causing military rule to resume in December 1869. In January 1870, Gen. Alfred H. Terry, the final commanding general of the Third District, purged the General Assembly's ex-Confederates, replaced them with the Republican runners-up, and reinstated the expelled black legislators, creating a large Republican majority in the legislature. On February 2, 1870, Georgia ratified the Fifteenth Amendment. Amos T. Akerman As U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman set up a justice system that vigorously prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan. During the tenure of Amos T. Akerman (1821‚Äì1880) as Attorney General of the United States from 1870 to 1871, thousands of indictments were brought against Klansmen in an effort to enforce the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and the Enforcement Acts of 1870 and 1871. Akerman, though born in the North, moved to Georgia after college and owned slaves; he fought for the Confederacy and became a scalawag during Reconstruction, speaking out for civil rights for Blacks. As U.S. Attorney General under President Grant, he became the first ex-Confederate to reach the cabinet. Akerman was unafraid of the Klan and committed to protecting the lives and civil rights of Blacks. To bolster Akerman's investigation, President Grant sent in Secret Service agents from the Justice Department to infiltrate the Klan to gather evidence for prosecution. The investigations revealed that many whites actively participated in Klan activities. With this evidence, Grant issued a Presidential proclamation to disarm and remove the Klan's notorious white robe and hood disguises. When the Klan ignored the proclamation, Grant sent Federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to put down the violent activities of the Klan. Grant teamed Akerman up with another reformer in 1870, a native Kentuckian, the first Solicitor General Benjamin Bristow, and the duo went on to prosecute thousands of Klan members and brought a brief quiet period of two years (1870‚Äì1872) in the turbulent Reconstruction era.Trelease, White Terror (1971) End of Reconstruction Georgia Democrats despised the 'Carpetbagger' administration of Rufus Bullock, accusing two of his friends, Foster Blodgett, superintendent of the state's Western and Atlantic Railroad, and Hannibal I. Kimball, owner of the Atlanta opera house where the state legislature met, of embezzling state funds. His efforts to prolong military rule caused considerable divisions in the states party, while black politicians complained that they did not receive an adequate share of patronage. In February 1870 the newly constituted legislature ratified the Fifteenth Amendment and chose new Senators to send to Washington. On July 15, Georgia became the last former Confederate state readmitted into the Union. The Democrats subsequently won commanding majorities in both houses of the General Assembly. Governor Rufus Bullock fled the state in order to avoid impeachment. With the voting restrictions against former Confederates removed, Democrat and ex-Confederate Colonel James Milton Smith was elected to complete Bullock's term. By January 1872 Georgia was fully under the control of the Redeemers, the state's resurgent white conservative Democrats. The so-called Redeemers used terrorism to strengthen their rule. The expelled African American legislators were particular targets for their violence. African American legislator Abram Colby was pulled out of his home by a mob and given 100 lashes with a whip. His colleague Abram Turner was murdered. Other African American lawmakers were threatened and attacked.See Drago p. 146 (in sources below) for details.

Given an n-tuple of integers (a_1,a_2,...,a_n), the next n-tuple in the sequence is formed by taking the absolute differences of neighbouring integers: :(a_1,a_2,...,a_n) \\\\rightarrow (a_1-a_2, a_2-a_3, ..., a_n-a_1)\\\\, . Another way of describing this is as follows. Arrange n integers in a circle and make a new circle by taking the difference between neighbours, ignoring any minus signs; then repeat the operation. Ducci sequences are named after Enrico Ducci (1864 - 1940), the Italian mathematician who discovered this in the 1930s. Ducci sequences are also known as the Ducci map or the n-number game. Open problems in the study of these maps still remain. Properties From the second n-tuple onwards, it is clear that every integer in each n-tuple in a Ducci sequence is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum members of the first n-tuple. As there are only a finite number of possible n-tuples with these constraints, the sequence of n-tuples must sooner or later repeat itself. Every Ducci sequence therefore eventually becomes periodic. If n is a power of 2 every Ducci sequence eventually reaches the n-tuple (0,0,...,0) in a finite number of steps. If n is not a power of two, a Ducci sequence will either eventually reach an n-tuple of zeros or will settle into a periodic loop of 'binary' n-tuples; that is, n-tuples of form k(b_1, b_2, ... b_n), k is a constant, and b_i \\\\in {0, 1}. An obvious generalisation of Ducci sequences is to allow the members of the n-tuples to be any real numbers rather than just integers. For example, this 4-tuple converges to (0, 0, 0, 0) in four iterations: (e, \\\\pi, \\\\sqrt2, 1) \\\\rightarrow (\\\\pi - e, \\\\pi - \\\\sqrt2, \\\\sqrt2 - 1, e - 1) \\\\rightarrow (e - \\\\sqrt2, \\\\pi - 2\\\\sqrt2 + 1, e - \\\\sqrt2, 2e - \\\\pi - 1) \\\\rightarrow (\\\\pi - e - \\\\sqrt2 + 1, \\\\pi - e - \\\\sqrt2 + 1, \\\\pi - e - \\\\sqrt2 + 1, \\\\pi - e - \\\\sqrt2 + 1) \\\\rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 0) The properties presented here do not always hold for these generalisations. For example, a Ducci sequence starting with the n-tuple (1, q, q2, q3) where q is the (irrational) positive root of the cubic x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 = 0 does not reach (0,0,0,0) in a finite number of steps, although in the limit it converges to (0,0,0,0). Examples Ducci sequences may be arbitrarily long before they reach a tuple of zeros or a periodic loop. The 4-tuple sequence starting with (0, 653, 1854, 4063) takes 24 iterations to reach the zeros tuple. (0, 653, 1854, 4063) \\\\rightarrow (653, 1201, 2209, 4063) \\\\rightarrow (548, 1008, 1854, 3410) \\\\rightarrow \\\\cdots \\\\rightarrow (0, 0, 128, 128) \\\\rightarrow (0, 128, 0, 128) \\\\rightarrow (128, 128, 128, 128) \\\\rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 0) This 5-tuple sequence enters a period 15 binary 'loop' after 7 iterations. \\\\begin{matrix} 1 5 7 9 9 \\\\rightarrow & 4 2 2 0 8 \\\\rightarrow & 2 0 2 8 4 \\\\rightarrow & 2 2 6 4 2 \\\\rightarrow & 0 4 2 2 0 \\\\rightarrow & 4 2 0 2 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\ 2 2 2 2 4 \\\\rightarrow & 0 0 0 2 2 \\\\rightarrow & 0 0 2 0 2 \\\\rightarrow & 0 2 2 2 2 \\\\rightarrow & 2 0 0 0 2 \\\\rightarrow & 2 0 0 2 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\ 2 0 2 2 2 \\\\rightarrow & 2 2 0 0 0 \\\\rightarrow & 0 2 0 0 2 \\\\rightarrow & 2 2 0 2 2 \\\\rightarrow & 0 2 2 0 0 \\\\rightarrow & 2 0 2 0 0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\ 2 2 2 0 2 \\\\rightarrow & 0 0 2 2 0 \\\\rightarrow & 0 2 0 2 0 \\\\rightarrow & 2 2 2 2 0 \\\\rightarrow & 0 0 0 2 2 \\\\rightarrow & \\\\cdots \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\ \\\\end{matrix} The following 6-tuple sequence shows that sequences of tuples whose length is not a power of two may still reach a tuple of zeros: \\\\begin{matrix} 1 2 1 2 1 0 \\\\rightarrow & 1 1 1 1 1 1 \\\\rightarrow & 0 0 0 0 0 0 \\\\ \\\\end{matrix} If some conditions are imposed on any \\"power of two\\"-tuple Ducci sequence, it would take that power of two or lesser iterations to reach the zeros tuple. It is hypothesized that these sequences conform to a rule. Modulo two form When the Ducci sequences enter binary loops, it is possible to treat the sequence in modulo two. That is:Florian Breuer, \\"Ducci sequences in higher dimensions\\" in INTEGERS: ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL NUMBER THEORY 7 (2007) :(a_1-a_2, a_2-a_3, ..., a_n-a_1)\\\\ = (a_1+a_2, a_2+a_3, ..., a_n + a_1)\\\\ mod 2 This forms the basis for proving when the sequence vanish to all zeros. Cellular automata right The linear map in modulo 2 can further be identified as the cellular automata denoted as rule 102 in Wolfram code and related to rule 90 through the Martin-Odlyzko-Wolfram map.S Lettieri, JG Stevens, DM Thomas, \\"Characteristic and minimal polynomials of linear cellular automata\\" in Rocky Mountain J. Math, 2006.M Misiurewicz, JG Stevens, DM Thomas, \\"Iterations of linear maps over finite fields\\", Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 2006 Rule 102 reproduces the Sierpinski triangle.Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Rule 102.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule102.html Other related topics The Ducci map is an example of a difference equation, a category that also include non- linear dynamics, chaos theory and numerical analysis. Similarities to cyclotomic polynomials have also been pointed out.F. Breuer et al. 'Ducci- sequences and cyclotomic polynomials' in Finite Fields and Their Applications 13 (2007) 293‚Äì304 While there are no practical applications of the Ducci map at present, its connection to the highly applied field of difference equations led to conjecture that a form of the Ducci map may also find application in the future.

Generating information and making meaning of it based on personal or societal experience is referred to as constructivism. Dewey's experiential learning pedagogy (that is, learning through experiences) comprises the learner actively participating in personal or authentic experiences to make meaning from it. Inquiry can be conducted through experiential learning because inquiry values the same concepts, which include engaging with the content/material in questioning, as well as investigating and collaborating to make meaning. Vygotsky approached constructivism as learning from an experience that is influenced by society and the facilitator. The meaning constructed from an experience can be concluded as an individual or within a group. In the 1960s Joseph Schwab called for inquiry to be divided into three distinct levels.Schwab, J. (1960) Inquiry, the Science Teacher, and the Educator. The School Review ¬© 1960 The University of Chicago Press This was later formalized by Marshall Herron in 1971, who developed the Herron Scale to evaluate the amount of inquiry within a particular lab exercise.Herron, M.D. (1971). The nature of scientific enquiry. The school review, 79(2), 171‚Äì212. Since then, there have been a number of revisions proposed and inquiry can take various forms. There is a spectrum of inquiry-based teaching methods available.Wilhelm, J. G., & Wilhelm, P. J. (2010). Inquiring minds learn to read, write, and think: Reaching all learners through inquiry. Middle School Journal, May 2010, 39‚Äì46.  Characteristics  Specific learning processes that people engage in during inquiry-learning include: *Creating questions of their own *Obtaining supporting evidence to answer the question(s) *Explaining the evidence collected *Connecting the explanation to the knowledge obtained from the investigative process *Creating an argument and justification for the explanation Inquiry learning involves developing questions, making observations, doing research to find out what information is already recorded, developing methods for experiments, developing instruments for data collection, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, outlining possible explanations and creating predictions for future study.  Levels  There are many different explanations for inquiry teaching and learning and the various levels of inquiry that can exist within those contexts. The article titled The Many Levels of Inquiry by Heather Banchi and Randy Bell (2008) clearly outlines four levels of inquiry. Level 1: Confirmation Inquiry The teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings. Level 2: Structured Inquiry The teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect. Level 3: Guided Inquiry The teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings. Level 4: Open/True Inquiry Students formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions. Banchi and Bell (2008) explain that teachers should begin their inquiry instruction at the lower levels and work their way to open inquiry in order to effectively develop students' inquiry skills. Open inquiry activities are only successful if students are motivated by intrinsic interests and if they are equipped with the skills to conduct their own research study.Yoon, H., Joung, Y. J., Kim, M. (2012). The challenges of science inquiry teaching for pre-service teachers in elementary classrooms: Difficulties on and under the scene. Research in Science & Technological Education, 42(3), 589‚Äì608.  Open/true inquiry learning  An important aspect of inquiry-based learning is the use of open learning, as evidence suggests that only utilizing lower level inquiry is not enough to develop critical and scientific thinking to the full potential.Yen C F and Hunang S C (2001) Authentic learning about tree frogs by preservice biology teachers in an open-inquiry research settings. Proc. Natl. Sci. Counc. ROC(D) 11, 1‚Äì10. Open learning has no prescribed target or result that people have to achieve. There is an emphasis on the individual manipulating information and creating meaning from a set of given materials or circumstances.Hannafin, M., Land, S., Oliver, K. (1999). Open learning environments: Foundation, methods, and models. In C. M. Reigeluth (Ed.), Instructional-design theories and models. A new paradigm of instructional theory Volume II (pp. 115‚Äì140). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. In many conventional and structured learning environments, people are told what the outcome is expected to be, and then they are simply expected to 'confirm' or show evidence that this is the case. Open learning has many benefits. It means students do not simply perform experiments in a routine like fashion, but actually think about the results they collect and what they mean. With traditional non-open lessons there is a tendency for students to say that the experiment 'went wrong' when they collect results contrary to what they are told to expect. In open learning there are no wrong results, and students have to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the results they collect themselves and decide their value. Open learning has been developed by a number of science educators including the American John Dewey and the German Martin Wagenschein. Wagenschein's ideas particularly complement both open learning and inquiry- based learning in teaching work. He emphasized that students should not be taught bald facts, but should understand and explain what they are learning. His most famous example of this was when he asked physics students to tell him what the speed of a falling object was. Nearly all students would produce an equation, but no students could explain what this equation meant. Wagenschein used this example to show the importance of understanding over knowledge.  Inquisitive learning  Sociologist of education Phillip Brown defined inquisitive learning as learning that is intrinsically motivated (e.g. by curiosity and interest in knowledge for its own sake), as opposed to acquisitive learning that is extrinsically motivated (e.g. by acquiring high scores on examinations to earn credentials). However, occasionally the term inquisitive learning is simply used as a synonym for inquiry-based learning.  Inquiry-based learning in academic disciplines = Inquiry learning in science education  Inquiry learning has been used as a teaching and learning tool for thousands of years, however, the use of inquiry within public education has a much briefer history.National Research Council. 2000. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards: A Guide for Teaching and Learning. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. Ancient Greek and Roman educational philosophies focused much more on the art of agricultural and domestic skills for the middle class and oratory for the wealthy upper class. It was not until the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason, during the late 17th and 18th century that the subject of Science was considered a respectable academic body of knowledge.Murphy, M. (2006). The History and Philosophy of Education: Voices of Educational Pioneers Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Pearson Education, Inc. Up until the 1900s the study of science within education had a primary focus on memorizing and organizing facts. John Dewey, a well-known philosopher of education at the beginning of the 20th century, was the first to criticize the fact that science education was not taught in a way to develop young scientific thinkers. Dewey proposed that science should be taught as a process and way of thinking ‚Äì not as a subject with facts to be memorized. While Dewey was the first to draw attention to this issue, much of the reform within science education followed the lifelong work and efforts of Joseph Schwab. Joseph Schwab was an educator who proposed that science did not need to be a process for identifying stable truths about the world that we live in, but rather science could be a flexible and multi-directional inquiry driven process of thinking and learning. Schwab believed that science in the classroom should more closely reflect the work of practicing scientists. Schwab developed three levels of open inquiry that align with the breakdown of inquiry processes that we see today.Schwab, J. 1966. The Teaching of Science. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press #Students are provided with questions, methods and materials and are challenged to discover relationships between variables #Students are provided with a question, however, the method for research is up to the students to develop #Phenomena are proposed but students must develop their own questions and method for research to discover relationships among variables Today, we know that students at all levels of education can successfully experience and develop deeper level thinking skills through scientific inquiry.National Science Education Standards. (1996). National Academy Press. Washington, DC. The graduated levels of scientific inquiry outlined by Schwab demonstrate that students need to develop thinking skills and strategies prior to being exposed to higher levels of inquiry. Effectively, these skills need to be scaffolded by the teacher or instructor until students are able to develop questions, methods, and conclusions on their own.Ban chi, H., & Bell, R. (2008). The Many Levels of Inquiry. Science and Children, 46(2), 26‚Äì29. A catalyst for reform within North American science education was the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the Soviet Union satellite. This historical scientific breakthrough caused a great deal of concern around the science and technology education the American students were receiving. In 1958 the U.S. congress developed and passed the National Defense Education Act in order to provide math and science teachers with adequate teaching materials.National Institute for Health. (2005). Doing Science: The Process of Science Inquiry. http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih6/inquiry/guide/info_process-a.htm America's National Science Education Standards (NSES) (1996) outlines six important aspects pivotal to inquiry learning in science education. #Students should be able to recognize that science is more than memorizing and knowing facts. #Students should have the opportunity to develop new knowledge that builds on their prior knowledge and scientific ideas. #Students will develop new knowledge by restructuring their previous understandings of scientific concepts and adding new information learned. #Learning is influenced by students' social environment whereby they have an opportunity to learn from each other. #Students will take control of their learning. #The extent to which students are able to learn with deep understanding will influence how transferable their new knowledge is to real life contexts.  Inquiry learning in social studies & history  The College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards was a joint collaboration among states and social studies organizations, including the National Council for the Social Studies, designed to focus social studies education on the practice of inquiry, emphasizing \\"the disciplinary concepts and practices that support students as they develop the capacity to know, analyze, explain, and argue about interdisciplinary challenges in our social world.\\" The C3 Framework recommends an \\"Inquiry Arc\\" incorporating four dimensions: 1. developing questions and planning inquiries; 2. applying disciplinary concepts and tools; 3. evaluating primary sources and using evidence; and 4. communicating conclusions and taking informed action. For example, a theme for this approach could be an exploration of etiquette today and in the past. Students might formulate their own questions or begin with an essential question such as \\"Why are men and women expected to follow different codes of etiquette?\\" Students explore change and continuity of manners over time and the perspectives of different cultures and groups of people. They analyze primary source documents such as books of etiquette from different time periods and form conclusions that answer the inquiry questions. Students finally communicate their conclusions in formal essays or creative projects. They may also take action by recommending solutions for improving school climate. Robert Bain in How Students Learn described a similar approach called \\"problematizing history\\".Bain, R.B., Donovan, M.S. & Bransford, J.D. (Eds). (2005). \\"They thought the world was flat?\\": Applying the principles of How People Learn in teaching high school history. How Students Learn. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309074339 First a learning curriculum is organized around central concepts. Next, a question and primary sources are provided, such as eyewitness historical accounts. The task for inquiry is to create an interpretation of history that will answer the central question. Students will form a hypothesis, collect and consider information and revisit their hypothesis as they evaluate their data.  Inquiry learning in Ontario's kindergarten program  After Charles Pascal's report in 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario's Ministry of Education decided to implement a full day kindergarten program that focuses on inquiry and play-based learning, called The Early Learning Kindergarten Program. As of September 2014, all primary schools in Ontario started the program. The curriculum document outlines the philosophy, definitions, process and core learning concepts for the program. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Piaget's child development theory and Dewey's experiential learning are the heart of the program's design. As research shows, children learn best through play, whether it is independently or in a group. Three forms of play are noted in the curriculum document, pretend or \\"pretense\\" play, socio-dramatic play and constructive play. Through play and authentic experiences, children interact with their environment (people and/or objects) and question things; thus leading to inquiry learning. A chart on page 15 clearly outlines the process of inquiry for young children, including initial engagement, exploration, investigation, and communication. The new program supports holistic approach to learning. For further details, please see the curriculum document. Since the program is extremely new, there is limited research on its success and areas of improvement. One government research report was released with the initial groups of children in the new kindergarten program. The Final Report: Evaluation of the Implementation of the Ontario Full-Day Early-Learning Kindergarten Program from Vanderlee, Youmans, Peters, and Eastabrook (2012) conclude with primary research that high-need children improved more compared to children who did not attend Ontario's new kindergarten program. As with inquiry-based learning in all divisions and subject areas, longitudinal research is needed to examine the full extent of this teaching/learning method.  Inquiry learning to read in the Netherlands, for reading mature children only  Since 2013 Dutch children have the opportunity of inquiry learning to read. The program is from the Dutch developmental psychologist dr. Ewald Vervaet, is named 'Ontdekkend Leren Lezen' (OLL; Discovery Learning to Read) and has three parts. In 2019 OLL is only available in Dutch. As we will see soon, an English version is feasible. OLL's main characteristic is that it is for children who are reading mature. Reading maturity is assessed with the Reading Maturity Test. It is a descriptive test that consists of two subtests. We present here the essentials. In the writing test ('schrijfproef') the child writes his name, the words 'mam' and 'dad' and some names more, which he happens to know. In the reading test ('leesproef') the tester makes new, transparent (common, rare or nonsense) words which the child then tries to read. Testwords consist of three or four letters. Suppose, Tim writes TIM, MAM, DAD and SOFIE (Tims sister). Good testwords are SIT, (nonsense word) FOM and MIST. When Tim reads SIT as 's, i, t', he only analyses the sounds of the word. He is definitely not reading mature then. However, when Tims reaction on SIT is first 's, i, t' and then 'sit', he analyses-and-synthesizes. He then is reading mature of almost so for there are some conditions more such af analysing-and-synthesizin of words of four letters and absence of mirror writing in the writing test. If a child is reading mature, he can start with OLL. The essential element of OLL are the discovering pages. See the discovering page for the letter 'k' below. The Dutch word 'kat' is the English word 'cat'; Dutch 'slak' is English 'snail', Dutch 'kers' is English 'cherry' and Dutch 'vork' is English 'fork'. Picture 1. Ontdekkend Leren Lezen (Dutch) (OLL; Discovery Learning to Read). In earlier chapters the child has discovered the letters 'a', 't', 's', 'l', 'e', 'r', 'v' and 'o' in similar discovering pages. Consequently, the novelty in the discovering page for the letter 'k' is the figure 'k': obviously, the figure 'k' is a letter in the Dutch alphabet, but how does 'k' sound? The child finds this out by making hypotheses: is the one animal perhaps a snail, 'slak' in Dutch? If so, the word below sounds as /slak/; the child reads 's, l, a, k; slak'; hypothesis confirmed! Similarly with 'k, a, t; kat', 'k, e, r, s; kers' and 'v, o, r, k; vork'. Consequently, the hypothesis 'That is a snail' has broadened itself to the hypothesis that 'k' sounds like /k/ as twice in the English word 'clock', and that hypothesis had proven to be tenable. Not just that: the process to find out how 'k' sounds, is rightly called a discovering process and Discovering Learing to Read clearly is a form of discovery or inquiry learning. Discovery Learning to Read (DLR) in English Phonemically speaking the Dutch language is much less transparent than almost completely transparent languages like Italian, Finnish and Czech, but much more transparent than languages like English and Danish. The classification of the British reading expert Debbie Hepplewhite (born in 1956) yields 217 letter-sound-combinations. The letter symbol 'a' for instance sounds on at least four ways: 'car', 'fat', 'saw' and 'table'. Conversely, the sound in 'table' is written on at least seven other ways: 'sundae', 'aid', 'straight', 'say', 'break', 'eight' and 'prey'. And so on. Maybe a native speaker of English can construct enough discovering pages for all these 217 letter-sound- combinations, but the time being Discovery Learning to Read (DLR) looks only feasible with one or more auxiliary letters. *The very first discovering page could be with the word '…ënd' and would actually be a discovering page for the letters '…ë', 'n' and 'd'. Picture 2. Ontdekkend Leren Lezen (Dutch) (OLL; Discovery Learning to Read). *In the second discovering page the letter 'm'-/m/ is discovered with 'm…ën', 'd…ëm' and eventually 'm…ëd' as discovering words. *In the third discovering page the letter 't'-/t/ is discovered with 'm…ët' en '…ënt' and possibly 't…ën' as discovering words. *In the fourth discovering page the letter 'e'-/e/ is discovered with 'ten', 'net', 'tent' and 'men' as discovering words. *In the fifth discovering page the letter 'r'-/r/ is discovered with 'r…ët', 'tr…ëm' and 'red' (for instance on the basis of the British/USA-flag, with an arrow near the red parts). *In the sixth discovering page the letter 's'-/s/ is discovered with 'stem', 'nest', 's…ënd' and '…ënts'. *In the seventh discovering page the letter 'p'-/p/ is discovered with 'pen', 't…ëp', 'p…ën' and 'm…ëp'. *In the eighth discovering page the letter 'i'-/i/ is discovered with 'pin', 'tin', 'pit' and 'mist'. *In the ninth discovering page the first auxiliary letter could be discovered: the /ai/-sound of 'my', 'pie', 'find' and 'ice', for instance with the discovering words 'night'-/nait/, 'mice'-/mais/, 'pie'-/pai/ and 'rice'-/rais/. Picture 3. Ontdekkend Leren Lezen (Dutch) (OLL; Discovery Learning to Read). To make it clear to the child from the outset that 'ai' is not a standard letter but an auxiliary letter, this is told to him and this letter is presented in a different way than the standard letters, for example with a line through it and/or against a gray instead of white background: as '…ëi', '…ëi' or '…ëi'. There are two conditions for a discovering page with a non-standard letter symbol. The first is that such a letter symbol resembles the standard alphabet as much as possible. And the second condition is that in the case of a combination of letters, the child is familiar with the composing parts. With '…ëi' both conditions are fulfilled: the parts are derived from the standard alphabet and the child knows '…ë' and 'i' from the first and the eighth discovering pages. In Vervaets opinion, the aim should be to keep the number of non-standard letter symbols as low as possible. After all, whatever kind of positive purpose is aimed for with non-standard letter symbols, the child learns them for the time being and should replace them ‚Äì preferably as early as possible ‚Äì and thus unlearn them. The number of things to be unlearned should therefore not be greater than strictly necessary. In later discovering pages the child discovers the correct spelling. The /…ëi/-sound has at least these six spellings: #'igh' ‚Äì 'bright', 'fight', 'flight', 'high', 'knight', 'light', 'might', 'nigh', 'night', 'plight', 'right', 'sigh', 'sight', 'slight', 'thigh', 'tight'; #'ie' ‚Äì 'die', 'hie', 'lie', 'pie', 'tie', 'vie'; #'i(nd)‚Äô ‚Äì 'behind', 'bind', 'blind', 'find', 'kind', 'mind', 'rind', 'wind'; #'y' ‚Äì by', 'cry', 'dry', 'fly', 'fry', 'my', 'pry', 'shy', 'sky', 'spy', 'try', 'why'; #'ei' ‚Äì 'eider', 'eiderdown'; #'i(consonant)e' ‚Äì 'jibe', 'nice', 'tide', 'life', 'oblige', 'bike', 'file', 'time', 'fine', 'ripe', 'wise', 'kite', 'dive', 'size'.  Misconceptions about inquiry  There are several common misconceptions regarding inquiry-based science, the first being that inquiry science is simply instruction that teaches students to follow the scientific method. Many teachers had the opportunity to work within the constraints of the scientific method as students themselves and figure inquiry learning must be the same. Inquiry science is not just about solving problems in six simple steps but much more broadly focused on the intellectual problem- solving skills developed throughout a scientific process. Additionally, not every hands-on lesson can be considered inquiry. Some educators believe that there is only one true method of inquiry, which would be described as the level four: Open Inquiry. While open inquiry may be the most authentic form of inquiry, there are many skills and a level of conceptual understanding that the students must have developed before they can be successful at this high level of inquiry. While inquiry-based science is considered to be a teaching strategy that fosters higher order thinking in students, it should be one of several methods used. A multifaceted approach to science keeps students engaged and learning. Not every student is going to learn the same amount from an inquiry lesson; students must be invested in the topic of study to authentically reach the set learning goals. Teachers must be prepared to ask students questions to probe their thinking processes in order to assess accurately. Inquiry-science requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise, however, the benefits outweigh the cost when true authentic learning can take place.  Neuroscience complexity  The literature states that inquiry requires multiple cognitive processes and variables, such as causality and co- occurrence that enrich with age and experience. Kuhn, et al. (2000) used explicit training workshops to teach children in grades six to eight in the United States how to inquire through a quantitative study. By completing an inquiry-based task at the end of the study, the participants demonstrated enhanced mental models by applying different inquiry strategies. In a similar study, Kuhan and Pease (2008) completed a longitudinal quantitative study following a set of American children from grades four to six to investigate the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies for inquiry. Results demonstrated that children benefitted from the scaffolding because they outperformed the grade seven control group on an inquiry task. Understanding the neuroscience of inquiry learning the scaffolding process related to it should be reinforced for Ontario's primary teachers as part of their training.  Notes for educators  Inquiry-based learning is fundamental for the development of higher order thinking skills. According to Bloom's Taxonomy, the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information or new understandings indicates a high level of thinking.Krathwohl, D. R. (2002). A revision of Bloom's Taxonomy: An overview. Theory into Practice, 41(4), 212‚Äì218. Teachers should be encouraging divergent thinking and allowing students the freedom to ask their own questions and to learn the effective strategies for discovering the answers. The higher order thinking skills that students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical thinking skills that they will be able to transfer to other subjects. As shown in the section above on the neuroscience of inquiry learning, it is significant to scaffold students to teach them how to inquire and inquire through the four levels. It cannot be assumed that they know how to inquire without foundational skills. Scaffolding the students at a younger age will result in enriched inquiring learning later. Inquiry-based learning can be done in multiple formats, including: * Field-work * Case studies * Investigations * Individual and group projects * Research projects Remember to keep in mind... * Teacher is Facilitator in IBL environment * Place needs of students and their ideas at the center * Don't wait for the perfect question, pose multiple open-ended questions. * Work towards common goal of understanding * Remain faithful to the students' line of inquiry * Teach directly on a need-to-know basis * Encourage students to demonstrate learning using a range of media  Necessity for teacher training  There is a necessity for professional collaboration when executing a new inquiry program (Chu, 2009; Twigg, 2010). The teacher training and process of using inquiry learning should be a joint mission to ensure the maximal amount of resources are used and that the teachers are producing the best learning scenarios. The scholarly literature supports this notion. Twigg's (2010) education professionals who participated in her experiment emphasized year round professional development sessions, such as workshops, weekly meetings and observations, to ensure inquiry is being implemented in the class correctly. Another example is Chu's (2009) study, where the participants appreciated the professional collaboration of educators, information technicians and librarians to provide more resources and expertise for preparing the structure and resources for the inquiry project. To establish a professional collaboration and researched training methods, administration support is required for funding.  Criticism  Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) review of literature found that although constructivists often cite each other's work, empirical evidence is not often cited. Nonetheless the constructivist movement gained great momentum in the 1990s, because many educators began to write about this philosophy of learning. Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, & Chinn cite several studies supporting the success of the constructivist problem-based and inquiry learning methods. For example, they describe a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application. Students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses. In contrast, Hmelo-Silver et al. also cite a large study by Geier on the effectiveness of inquiry-based science for middle school students, as demonstrated by their performance on high-stakes standardized tests. The improvement was 14% for the first cohort of students and 13% for the second cohort. This study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students. In a 2006 article, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute's president, Chester E. Finn Jr., was quoted as saying \\"But like so many things in education, it gets carried to excess... [the approach is] fine to some degree.\\". The organization ran a study in 2005 concluding that the emphasis states put on inquiry-based learning is too great. Richard E. Mayer from the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2004 that there was sufficient research evidence to make any reasonable person skeptical about the benefits of discovery learning‚Äîpracticed under the guise of cognitive constructivism or social constructivism‚Äîas a preferred instructional method. He reviewed research on discovery of problem-solving rules culminating in the 1960s, discovery of conservation strategies culminating in the 1970s, and discovery of LOGO programming strategies culminating in the 1980s. In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer. It should be cautioned that inquiry-based learning takes a lot of planning before implementation. It is not something that can be put into place in the classroom quickly. Measurements must be put in place for how students knowledge and performance will be measured and how standards will be incorporated. The teacher's responsibility during inquiry exercises is to support and facilitate student learning (Bell et al., 769‚Äì770). A common mistake teachers make is lacking the vision to see where students' weaknesses lie. According to Bain, teachers cannot assume that students will hold the same assumptions and thinking processes as a professional within that discipline (p. 201). While some see inquiry-based teaching as increasingly mainstream, it can be perceived as in conflict with standardized testing common in standards-based assessment systems which emphasise the measurement of student knowledge, and meeting of pre-defined criteria, for example the shift towards \\"fact\\" in changes to the National Assessment of Educational Progress as a result of the American No Child Left Behind program.  Additional scholarly research literature  Chu (2009) used a mixed method design to examine the outcome of an inquiry project completed by students in Hong Kong with the assistance of multiple educators. Chu's (2009) results show that the children were more motivated and academically successful compared to the control group. Cindy Hmelo-Silver reviewed a number of reports on a variety studies into problem based learning.Hmelo-Silver, C. (2004) Problem Based Learning: What and how do students learn . Educational Psychology Review, Vol. 16, No. 3, September 2004 Edelson, Gordin and Pea describe five significant challenges to implementing inquiry-based learning and present strategies for addressing them through the design of technology and curriculum. They present a design history covering four generations of software and curriculum to show how these challenges arise in classrooms and how the design strategies respond to them.Edelson, D., Gordin, D., Pea, R. (1999) Addressing the Challenges of Inquiry-Based Learning Through Technology and Curriculum Design Journal of the Learning Sciences 8.3 (1999): 391‚Äì450.

I'm a Teenage Outlaw is a British television programme filmed in the Czech Republic and first aired on CITV. The show follows three hapless outlaws during the English Civil War, who are trying to bring justice back to the land. Synopsis The year is 1643, a time of civil war in England and Wales. When twelve-year-old Tom York inherits the family business, he discovers that his mother was the wild and daring highwayman Swiftnick - a title which now passes to Tom. But the last thing Tom needs is a dangerous and poorly paid after school job. Having said that, he does look kind of cool in his outlaw mask... Tom loves the fame and glory that comes with the title Swiftnick. Seeing his pictures on wanted posters is quite a kick. If only it weren't from the dangerous highway stuff, this would be the perfect job for him. Tom's vanity is coupled with an overblown sense of his ability as a highwayman: his vanity and over confidence regularly land him and his gang in trouble. If things get a little to dangerous, Tom isn't above taking a non confrontational approach to hold-ups; he's quite prepared to lie, cheat, charm, trick, scam and beg. And if those ploys don't work he can run fast too!(1) The Swifnick Gang (Tom, Moses and Deedee) will face different problems and will have to solve them in the most bizarre ways. They will set out their adventures together...defeating Sir John and robbing coaches. Cast Lucinda Dryzek as Lady Devereux/DeeDee Benjamin Smith as Tom A.K.A. Swiftnick Eliot Otis Walters as Moses Brian Hibbard as Sir John Steve O'Donnell as Captain Watt Mattew Curtis as Food Tester George Pearcy as Giles Characters=Major Characters Tom - Sorting through the belongings of his dead mother, 12-year-old Tom York discovers that she was the notorious highwaywoman Swiftnick. Though something of a coward, Tom dons a mask and, having decided he looks dashing enough, takes up the mantle to continue the family tradition.He is obnoxious and has a soft spot for Lady Devereux.Tom would do anything to get money and would sometimes end up with a rubbish plan like when he and Moses dressed up as women to get in the castle in the episode \\"Kidnapped\\". Tom thinks extremely highly of himself and presents himself as someone who is nearly unbeatable, when he perfectly well knows he is not. Moses - Tom is joined in his risky venture by his best friend Moses, a precocious ten-year-old who fancies himself as an inventor but whose creations rarely work. He was once Sir John's inventor. At times he is feeble and is useless but can be fiercely loyal to Tom as was displayed in the episode \\"Pants\\". Deedee - Deedee is a tomboy-ish girl who is more courageous, resourceful and capable than the two lads put together. Although, like the others, Deedee masquerades as a peasant, she is actually Lady Devereux, the lady of the local castle. The other two are unaware of this; she hides herself by making up excuses when she gets news from the castle. She has a secret tunnel that can lead out of the village from her wardrobe. In the episode \\"Locked In\\", the three got locked in the crypt and she decided to write about when they all first met, it turned out that she was being robbed but tricked them into giving her their clothes. She decided to be an outlaw when she thought her father who went to war was kidnapped. In one of the episodes, Lady Devereux falls for a rich lord called Felix. Although criticising Tom's leadership skills at times she prefers to have him lead rather than anyone else as otherwise the gang falls apart as seen in \\"Pants\\" and the episode where Bardolph becomes leader of the gang. Sir John Snakelaw - The Devereux castle has been commandeered by her uncle, the evil Sir John Snakelaw, who imposes crippling taxes on the local populace. Sir John is supported by a motley crew including Captain Watt and a hapless team of guards. He also has a food taster whose ingestion of poison has prematurely aged him so that he looks 50 rather than 20.He hates his mother and would do anything to get money. He also pays a lot of money for the capture of the Swiftnick Gang. He is Lady Devereux's legal guardian. In one of the episodes he sang Romeo and Juliet to a rich widow named Countess Cornocopia for money but was tricked by Swiftnick. Sir John is known to have a particularly bad reaction to Shellfish especially prawns, this reaction causes him to fart rudely and often, one such time was in \\"Love Hurts\\" in front of Countess Cornocopia. In the Episode \\"Pants\\" he discourages Captain Watt ordering shellfish from the caterers once they believe to have captured Swiftnick. Giles - Sir John's son, the spoilt Giles, has a crush on Lady Devereux but it is strictly one way. He takes lessons in flirting and fencing (although not showing the same aptitude for it as Lady Devereux). He will do anything to gain \\"Daddy\\"'s approval. Giles once sabotaged Lord Montague's kart during the village karting race. Minor Characters Captain Watt- Sir John's right hand and his personal guard's captain. Watt is very loyal to Sir John and was one of the main characters in the episode \\"Fools Day\\", when he told Sir John that an assassin was on his way to kill him for a joke, but Sir John thought it was true and dressed up as a peasant. Bardolph- The Village Idiot Bardolph was seen in 4 episodes. The first appearance was in \\"Valentine\\" in which he is delivered a valentine by Tom. Bardolph confuses it with a brother he never had because of it being addressed to \\"village idiot\\", he quickly realises this and exclaims \\"it must be for me!\\" and runs away ranting. One was when he became the new leader of the Swiftnick Gang when he saw Tom taking of his mask. He ends up being in the stocks and was going to tell John their real identities when he was stopped by Tom. Bardolph also took part in the village Karting race in one episode of which he won. Bardolph became Sir John's mother's man servant. Sir John's Mother- Sir John's mother appeared in one episode when she looked for a manservant in secret on a visit to the castle, and almost took Captain Watt but took Bardolph instead. Food Tester- The Food Tester is Sir John's servant. As his name he tests the food Sir John was supposed to eat and every time there is something poisonous. His real age is 20 but because of how much poison he had consumed looked like 50. Lord Montague- Lord Montague is Giles's friend and in one episode was almost engaged with Lady Devereux. He also took part in the village karting race in which his kart was sabotaged by Giles and in turn sabotaged Giles' simultaneously. Felix- The son of one of the most richest widow in the country called Countess Cornacopia. He fancies Lady Devereux, which causes Tom to hate him. His mother is being courted by Sir John for money purposes only. Countess Cornocopia- A very rich widow which tempted Sir John to court her. She is the proud mother of Felix Cornocopia.

Water privatisation has taken many different forms in South Africa. Since 1996 some municipalities decided to involve the private sector in water and sanitation service provision through short-term management contracts, long-term concessions and contracts for specific services such as wastewater treatment. Most municipalities continue to provide water and sanitation services through public utilities or directly themselves. Suez of France, through its subsidiary Water and Sanitation Services South Africa (WSSA), and Sembcorp of Singapore, through its subsidiary Silulumanzi, are international firms with contracts in South Africa. According to the Managing Director of Silulumanzi \\"the South African water market is still in its infancy and municipalities are unsure of how to engage the private sector.\\"Marius van Aardt:A south African story:Silulumanzi's perspective, in: Transforming the World of Water, Global Water Summit 2010, Global Water Intelligence and International Desalination Association, p. 156-157 Cases of water privatisation=Dolphin Coast (iLembe) In January 1999, the Siza Water Company (SWC), then part of the French SAUR Group, became the first private company to manage a water and wastewater utility in South Africa. Under a groundbreaking 30-year concession contract, SWC assumed responsibility for providing water and sanitation services to what was then known as the Borough of Dolphin Coast, a locality in the iLembe District Municipality with a permanent population estimated at 34,000 located about 50 kilometers north of Durban. The privatisation was welcomed and supported by the city council and senior government officials, including President Thabo Mbeki who visited the area to sanction the process. The Development Bank of Southern Africa and the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit supported the development and completion of the concession arrangement by providing technical and advisory services during the conception and contract development phase. This helped to make this option understandable and financially feasible. SWC is a local company formed by Saur International of France (which holds a 58% share), four other companies and company employees. After initial difficulties the contract was renegotiated in 2001, including a substantial reduction in investment requirements and the provision of free basic water. A more accurate billing and collection system has led to an increase in revenues of 68%, while tariffs were increased by about 30% and the number of customers increased by 6%.USAID: CASE STUDIES OF BANKABLE WATER AND SEWERAGE UTILITIES; SOUTH AFRICA: BOROUGH OF DOLPHIN COAST 2005, p. 3-11 In May 2007, SWC became a subsidiary of the British firm Cascal N.V. and in October 2012 it became part of the Sembcorp group from Singapore. Nelspruit (Mbombela) In 1999 the municipality of Nelspruit in Mpumalanga (ex-East Transvaal) signed a 30-year concession with the Greater Nelspruit Utility Company (GNUC), a subsidiary of Cascal, itself part of the British firm Biwater. The concession serves 350,000 people in Nelspruit and neighboring townships. GNUC subsequently changed its name to Silulumanzi. In July 2010 it was sold to Sembcorp of Singapore.Silulumanzi:About us, retrieved on 15 November 2010 According to the private concessionnaire, in the first two years of the concession thousands of unregistered connections were found and many household and mains leaks repaired. The savings have enabled water delivery to other areas not previously supplied. Over 8,000 broken meters have been replaced and a further 15,000 new meters have been installed to provide new house connections and formalise existing unauthorised supplies. Total water supplied into distribution fell from 66,000 m3/day to 60,000, despite an increase of over 30% of customers supplied. This was achieved by reducing non- revenue water. Traditional political protests had involved non-payment of water bills so that a change in culture was required. Facilitators have worked in the villages and townships educating, discussing and encouraging the regular payment of water and sewage bills. Besides meetings with elected representatives, they engage in street theatre and sports sponsorship. Also local offices have been established throughout the concession area to provide easy access for customers to pay their bills, raise queries, deal with complaints and report leaks. As a result, revenue collection has substantially improved.Biwater:Silulumanzi Water & Wastewater Concession, South Africa, retrieved on 15 November 2010 Furthermore, the portion of households with access to basic water supply increased from 52% in 1999 to 88% in 2009. In formalised urban areas, 24-hour supply has been extended to 82% of households, up from 37% in 1999. Johannesburg In January 2001, the city of Johannesburg established the municipal company Johannesburg Water and subsequently signed a management contract with Water and Sanitation Services South Africa (WSSA), a joint venture between Suez (ex-Lyonnaise des Eaux), its subsidiary Northumbrian Water Group and the South African company Group 5. The contract was not extended when it expired in 2006. Other cases In 2003, WSSA also had a 25- year concession in Queenstown, Eastern Cape and provided water and wastewater services to over 2 million people in the provinces of Kwa-Zulu Natal (Dolphin Coast), Eastern Cape (including in Stutterheim), Western Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng.Suez See also *Water supply and sanitation in South Africa *Water in Africa  References External links Clarissa Brocklehurst, WSP Africa:Durban Metro Water Private Sector Partnerships to Serve the Poor, May 2001 The Water Dialogues-South Africa, case studies of various forms of privatisation in South Africa (including Ilembe/ Siza Water concession, Johannesburg's management contract, and others)  Further reading  * McDonald, David A, and John Pape, Cost Recovery and the Crisis of Service Delivery in South Africa, Zed Press, London, 2002. * McDonald, David A, and Greg Ruiters, The Age of Commodity: Water Privatization in Southern Africa, Earthscan Press, London, 2005.

Early life and education Schneirov attended Grinnell College from 1966 to 1968, where he helped found and lead that school's chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). He also started the underground newspaper \\"Pterodactyl.\\" He transferred to the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1971. He obtained a master's degree in history in 1975 and a Ph.D. in history in 1984, both from Northern Illinois University. Career Schneirov was named a Fulbright Scholar after receiving his doctorate. During the 1985 to 1986 academic year, he lectured at the Institut Fur England und Amerikastudien at the University of Frankfurt in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. He returned to Germany in 2011, where he taught at Westfallische Wilhelms-Universitat in Muenster. In 1986, Schneirov won appointment as an adjunct professor at The Ohio State University. In 1989, Schneirov was named an assistant professor at Indiana State University. He was promoted to associate professor in 1993, and made a full professor in 1999. In 2020 Schneirov entered \\"phased retirement\\" from Indiana State University. He will teach in the Fall of 2020 and 2021. Research interests Schneirov is a noted scholar of working-class history and of the Gilded Age-Progressive Era. Much of his research has focused on the American labor movement during the Gilded Age. He has also researched the period of the 1960s and 70s, and regularly teaches a class: \\"The Sixties: Counterculture and Protest.\\" Schneirov's most notable work is his 1998 book, Labor and Urban Politics: Class Conflict and the Origins of Modern Liberalism in Chicago, 1864-97. The work won the Urban History Association's Kenneth Jackson Award in 1999 for best book in North American urban history. The book is a definitive account of the rise of the Chicago labor movement during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, the struggle for the eight-hour day, and the Pullman Strike of 1894. The work is considered a major reinterpretation of Gilded Era history. Schneirov's thesis is that the American labor movement exerted a profound influence on Chicago and urban politics, and radically transformed liberal and progressive political thought. As noted labor scholar Joseph McCartin observed: :Richard Schneirov has written an ambitious and important book. It is ambitious in that it aims to combine the concerns of labor history and of political history in order to offer a new perspective on both the origins of modern liberalism and the nature of the late nineteenth- century class formation and labor organization. It is important in that Schneirov's fusion of class and politics yields a set of fresh insights that are likely to engage historians for a long time to come.McCartin, \\"Review: Labor and Urban Politics...\\" Journal of Social History, Summer 2000, p. 1010. In 2006 Schneirov contributed an important article periodizing the Gilded Age: ‚ÄúThoughts on Periodizing the Gilded Age: Capital Accumulation, Society, and Politics, 1873-1898‚Äù and rejoinder to responses by Rebecca Edwards and James L Huston, Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era 5 (July 2006): 189-240. In 2012, Schneirov has published \\"Chicago in the Age of Capital: Class, Politics, and Democracy during the Civil War and Reconstruction\\" (with John B. Jentz). The book charts the rise of a capitalist economy and society out of an artisan one and the ensuing political consequences. In 2014 Routledge published his extended essay and primer on American democracy (with Gaston Fernandez), \\"Democracy as a Way of Life in America: A History.\\" In 2019 Schneirov published a re-interpretation of AFL founder Samuel Gompers in ‚ÄúUncovering the Contradictions in Samuel Gompers‚Äôs ‚ÄòMore‚Äô: Reading ‚ÄòWhat Does Labor Want?‚Äù Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. Schneirov views Gompers as a leader who tried to bridge diverse discourses and political viewpoints within the late nineteenth century labor movement, rather than simply representing a narrow stratum of craft workers. Schneirov's current research agenda focuses on American politics and culture during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.

After an inauspicious beginning, the camp attracted wide praise in the Jewish educational community for its ability to teach campers Hebrew. First moving the camp to a site in Connecticut in 1950, Habonim, due to financial troubles, was forced to move the camp again several times, in 1951 to the Cream Ridge Farm, in 1952 to Camp Moshava, and in 1953 to share the campsite of Camp Galil in Pennsylvania. The sharing of one campground by two different camps turned out to be untenable, so Habonim discontinued Amal after 1953.

A predominantly instrumental recording which utilises elements of both rock and electronic music, it blends genres including techno, dream pop, ambient music, and dub. Guitarist Mark Clifford worked continuously on tracks while other members either completed them or provided component ideas. The album was met with positive reviews from critics, and was released by Astralwerks in the US the following year. It was followed up with the EP Starethrough on Warp in 1994. It was re-released in 2007 in a deluxe format that included unreleased, re-mixed tracks and other music that was only released on compilations. The album continued to receive praise on its re- issue. Background and production Mark Clifford formed Seefeel in 1992 after posting advertisements for potential group members. After performing a few shows and recording demos, Seefeel signed to the Too Pure label in late 1992. Too Pure's co-owner Richard Roberts stated that upon hearing Seefeel's demo \\"there was no obvious song for radio, but in my opinion it felt good. As we viewed ourselves as an experimental label that didn't want to be tied to a sound or a scene, it seemed to make sense to release something with the band.\\" Seefeel chose Too Pure as they felt the label had respect for its artists, despite the low budget given to them to record Quique. Clifford described the composition of the track as \\"messing around with a particular sound and then that sound would quite often just evoke a melody. Because the sounds we used were very much based around harmonics and stuff.\\" The songs were completed before recording in the studio and many tracks had been performed live prior to the album's release. The only song written in the recording studio was \\"Charlotte's Mouth\\". All the songs on the album were completed in a way that would allow Seefeel to re-create their music in a live setting. Quique was recorded in July 1993. During their time in the studio, Seefeel also recorded the EP More Like Space. Clifford felt that the tracks on More Like Space were simpler to create while those on Quique were more involved and took longer. Daren Seymour stated that Clifford was \\"working on a constant basis. The other members of the band contributed either complete tracks or component ideas into the process ‚Äì some where accepted or not as Mark acted as the editor, and quite rightly so at times!\\" After the album was mastered, the group had Too Pure remove a track from the album before it was released. Music The music on Quique is predominantly instrumental. Some tracks include wordless vocals from Seefeel's guitarist and vocalist Sarah Peacock. Peacock's vocals are low in the audio mix and are heard on the tracks \\"Industrious\\" and \\"Charlotte's Mouth\\". The tone of the album has been described as less dark than the group's follow-up albums Succour and CH-VOX. The album's unusual blend of genres led critics to apply various different labels to Quique, associating it with styles such as dream pop, ambient techno, dub, intelligent dance music, and shoegaze. Critic Simon Reynolds described the group as \\"the best\\" of various dream pop bands who had \\"turned on to techno.\\" Glenn Swan of AllMusic described the album's mixture of genres as \\"a sort of electronic hybrid that had listeners simultaneously scratching their heads\\", while Jess Harvell of Pitchfork stated that the audience will \\"hear the beginnings of a still- thriving genre that remains slippery and unnamed, purely electronic music with a strange, tangy rock aftertaste.\\" Paste writer Robert Ham classified the album as a post-rock album in 2016, as did Simon Reynolds in his 2011 book Bring the Noise. AllMusic's John Bush described it as \\"an even colder document of ambient indie techno than the previous EPs had predicted,\\" and noted that \\"[t]he album was hailed -- mostly in rock circles -- as a techno album which indie kids could listen to.\\" Mark Richardson of Pitchfork located it on \\"the oceanic end of shoegaze.\\" \\"Charlotte's Mouth\\" is named after actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg. Clifford was irritated by being placed within a genre by critics, stating that Seefeel \\"weren't trying to fit into any one of their scenes and it felt a little like we were almost having convention thrust upon us when that was the very thing we were reacting against.\\" Glenn Swan compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Cam Lindsay of Exclaim! noted that \\"Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching.\\" The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt \\"more affinity with them than many of the bands we'd met ‚Äì Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!\\" \\"Climactic Phase #3\\" contains minimal percussion, a bass line that rises and falls that creates a faint pulse to guide it. Clifford described \\"Climactic Phase #3\\" as \\"an attempt to see how much juice I could squeeze out of a few repetitive loops.\\" Both \\"Climatic Phase No. 3\\" and \\"Polyfusion\\" contain guitar feedback and drum machines. The vocals on \\"Polyfusion\\" were described by Sarah Peacock as not having lyrics, but vocalizations invented for their sonic value. Peacock said that she loved the song's \\"groovy and dubby\\" feel, but disliked the \\"pitchy vocals\\" \\"Imperial\\", \\"Climatic Phase #3\\" and \\"Plainsong\\" were made from what Clifford called \\"an obsession for sampling and sequencing. Very standard technology now, but at the time the ability to sample and shift and manipulate guitar sounds was fascinating to me.\\" Clifford would later describe \\"Plainsong\\" as attempt to put \\"the vaguest hint of a song into the equation\\", having had difficulty with the rhythm of the song changing it continuously. \\"Industrious\\" showcases ambiance and drums which anchor the mix. Clifford characterized the song as an audio experiment by processing drum machines through guitar effects. \\"Charlotte's Mouth\\", named after Charlotte Gainsbourg, contains guitar, bass and metallic percussion. The song began as a loop of Justin Fletcher's percussion which later had guitar and vocals added. \\"Through You\\" is the only Seefeel song to use a keyboard on Quique. Clifford composed it quickly, noting that it was made in \\"about two hours\\". \\"Filter Dub\\" was described by Clifford as heavily influenced by Jah Wobble. It does not feature a large amount of sampled guitars like other tracks on the album. When asked how the group felt about Quique in 2013, Clifford said he found that it \\"holds up okay‚Äîsome tracks more than others\\" and that he felt \\"mostly good about [the songs]\\" and \\"looked forward to playing certain tracks live\\". Peacock spoke positively about the album, saying that since it was their first album, it \\"will always be the fondest\\". Release Quique was released in the United Kingdom in late 1993 on Too Pure. In February 1994, US label Astralwerks announced that they had signed the group and were set to give the album a US release in April of that year. Quique was released on compact disc and cassette by Astralwerks. On 10 June 1994, Astralwerks released \\"Plainsong\\" as a single, with two remixes of \\"Time to Find Me\\" by the Aphex Twin as b-sides. In 2003, Mark Clifford stated that Quique sold between sixteen or seventeen thousand copies. After the release of Quique, Seefeel left Too Pure and signed to the more electronic music oriented Warp. Warp released their follow-up EP Starethrough on 18 April 1994. In 2007, Quique was re-released in a deluxe edition. This version of the album included a bonus disc containing unreleased tracks, re-mixes and songs that appeared on compilation albums. Quique was re-released on vinyl on 27 August 2013 through Light in the Attic Records and its Modern Classics Recordings series, in conjunction with Medical Records. It was released with a gate fold sleeve with 1000 copies printed on blue vinyl. In November 2018, the group performed the album in full at festivals in Barcelona and Utrecht in celebration of its 25th anniversary, under the heading \\"Seefeel performing 'Quique'\\". Critical reception Simon Reynolds gave Quique a positive review in Spin, stating that Seefeel had \\"struck a sublime groove between MBV's sensual tumult and Aphex Twin's ambient serenity\\". In his review for Melody Maker, Reynolds wrote that the group's songs \\"sometimes need a bit more space in their sound, a bit of emptiness to punctuate the drone-swarm. Like [My Bloody Valentine] on Loveless, they're sometimes so blissed it's suffocating\\" and that \\"overall, Quique is consummate, a blanched canvas for the imagination, and a cracking debut.\\" Jon Savage of Mojo gave a positive review of the album, stating that \\"throughout much of Quique, Seefeel achieve that spacious weightlessness hinted at by their titles: 'Climactic Phase #3', 'Filter Dub', 'Signals'\\". In a review of the group's next album Succour, Selects Gareth Grundy remarked negatively on Quique, opining that it \\"owed as much to My Bloody Valentine as Aphex, but never believably cemented the two influences.\\" Louise Gray of The Times commented on Quique in 1994, stating that the album \\"drew sighs of admiration from critics and the public alike\\" and was \\"a beautiful document which has its roots in an experimentalism that began with La Monte Young and has, in recent years, been continued variously by Glenn Branca, the Swans and Spiritualised. The points of contact with any of the current crop of dance music-makers are minimal.\\" In 1999, CMJ New Music Monthly summarised the British critics' reception to Quique, stating that the album \\"earned Seefeel several months of adoration in the British music press and subsequent obscurity which usually follows such kudos\\". The Village Voices Robert Christgau gave the album a \\"neither\\" rating, indicating that an album \\"may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't.\\" Later reviews have been positive. Jess Harvell of Pitchfork opined that Quique \\"still sounds timeless.\\" Glenn Swan of AllMusic praised the album as \\"Seefeel at their most ornate. They squint by staring into the geometric refractions of light and record the results.\\" Jason Ferguson of Harp described Quique as \\"shimmered with a futuristic ethereality that was far more substantial than the electro- ambience of the era, but also much less assaultive than the shoegazers Seefeel was affiliated with early on,\\" adding that the 2007 re-issue was \\"a fitting tribute to a very unique sound.\\" Los Angeles Times writer Chris Barton called it an \\"underrated\\" album \\"that even 20 years later sounds like nothing else.\\" Mark Edwards of The Sunday Times gave the Redux edition a positive review, referring to Quique as the group's \\"finest moment\\" and concluding: \\"If you like music to have structure, Quique will drive you barmy; but if you consider the presence of the word 'texture' in an album review to be a positive, you might well enjoy this languid landmark.\\" Cam Lindsay wrote in Exclaim! that \\"While it doesn't feel like a timely release, the re-discovery of Seefeel (no word yet on a reunion) certainly verifies their relevance in today's music, especially in light of neo-gazers like Ulrich Schnauss and Tim Hecker.\\" In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 34 on his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties\\" for Freaky Trigger. In 2016, Pitchfork placed Quique at number 13 on its list of \\"The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time\\", and Paste included it at number 8 on its list of \\"The 50 Best Post-Rock Albums\\".

Explosion vents are available in the versions self-destructive, non-self-re-closing and re-usable, self-re-closing. Explosion vents in service Explosion vent construction must balance the contradictory requirements \\"low inertia\\" and \\"high strength\\". Inertia negatively affects an explosion vent's efficiency. High strength is required to endure the considerable forces that move the vent's venting element in order to open the venting orifice.

Discharge hood with explosion relief panels and fracture clip releases The evaluation of an explosion vent's efficiency and its range of application are subject to rules. See National Fire Protection Association 68, EN 14797. During normal venting, the explosion is freely discharged, allowing flames to exit the process being protected. When the protected vessel or pipe is located indoors, ducts are generally used to safely convey the explosion outside the building. However, ductwork has disadvantages and may result in decreased venting efficiency. Flameless venting, in combination with explosion vents, can extinguish the flame from the vented explosion without the use of expensive ducting, limitations to equipment location, or more costly explosion protection.

Mud pies are not meant to be eaten, although they can be thrown in the face. A broader category describes this activity as mud play. Description Mud pies are composed from a mixture of water and soil. Other ingredients are sometimes added to the basic water and soil mixture such as plants and pebbles. The 'pie' will stay together if the mud is sticky ‚Äì similar to bread dough. In addition to mud pies, children often create other structures like mud sandwiches and mud-based tea parties. Creating a mud pie can be a very enjoyable activity and is thought to nurture the imagination of a child. Making mud pies allows the exploration of textures, and establishes the basis of scientific reasoning as they change the variables such as the addition of less water or even freezing the mixture. Some children do not enjoy the activity. A child may hesitate to \\"get dirty.\\" Many people recall this childhood activity with fondness. An author recounts: \\"As a child, I was drawn to mud. Some of my fondest childhood memories saw me covered in the stuff, head to toe.\\"  Techniques  Adult with a mud 'facial' Digging a small hole, adding water and stirring with a stick is one method used by children to create the mud pie. Some choose to organize a party or event for children with creating mud pies as part of the activities. The benefits of making pies out of mud include: strengthening the sense of touch and developing \\"true\\" creativity. Some take a more formal approach to the activity and dedicate children's play spaces to the making of mud pies. A mud pie kitchen can be created to make other mud play 'food'. A mud center can be created in a school setting. Some teachers are able to incorporate art and music into mud pie-making activities during school. Other ingredients have been proposed and include: * sawdust * eggshells * orange peel * crushed leaves *sand Washing up afterwards is to be expected. Adults can participate in creating mud pies and some continue to use mud as a facial enhancing product.  Other types of mud play  Mud play can include the use of mud as an artistic medium. Thin mixtures of mud and water can be used as paint and applied to paper with twig 'brushes'. After the mud dries, different areas can demonstrate the different color shades and constituents of the mixture. Events Mudfest activity International Mud Day was established in 2009 by schoolchildren in Australia and Nepal. Schools in many countries organize mud play events. International Mud Month was proposed in 2015. Adults sometimes participate in mud festivals. Other uses Some desserts made out of crushed cookies and other ingredients are called mud pies or puddings.

The station has a main transmitter site near Lake Morena, just west of Campo.Radio-Locator.com/KYDO The station also uses KYDO-FM1, a 700 watt booster transmitter on Mount San Miguel, and licensed to Santee. KYDO is owned by the Educational Media Foundation, based in Rocklin, California. KYDO airs an internet-based Worship music format, and is the Air 1 network affiliate for the southern San Diego area. No local programming originates here as the station broadcasts complete wall-to-wall syndication. KYDO is considered a \\"move in\\" station, because it started in Brawley in California's Imperial Valley before moving closer to San Diego. History=KSIQ in Brawley, California (1981-2009) This station's history began on February 12, 1981, when a construction permit was issued, calling for a 50 kW station at 96.1 FM, licensed to Brawley. The station was assigned the KSIQ call letters on March 25 of that year. On September 10 of that year, KSIQ signed on.Broadcasting Yearbook 2009 page D-82 It aired a Top 40 format and was called \\"SI-96\\" (pronounced \\"SEE-96\\"), using the middle letters of its call sign. \\"SI\\" stood for the Spanish-language word for \\"yes.\\" This was meant to attract the large Hispanic audience in the Imperial Valley and to have them interpret the name as \\"Yes-96.\\" The station would later rebrand as Q96, using the last letter of its callsign. During its time in the Imperial Valley, the station's signal was heard as far west as Yuma, Arizona, and was also popular across the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border in Mexicali, a city of more than half a million people in the state of Baja California. Move to San Diego Market (2010) While KSIQ was successful in its home territory, the Imperial Valley is considered a small market in radio. In early 2010, KSIQ announced that it was moving to San Diego, a much larger market with the potential to increase KSIQ's advertising revenue. The only on- air DJs who moved with the station were morning host Tony Driskill and afternoon host Stacy Lynn. The personalities moved again to Cherry Creek's Lake Tahoe cluster at the end of 2010, voice-tracking to KSIQ in the process, At this point, all of the programs were syndicated, with no local talent whatsoever. KSIQ had been broadcasting at 50,000 watts in Brawley, but the move to Campo required the station to drop its power in half. The station began broadcasting to the San Diego area from its new main transmitter and booster on March 17, 2010, continuing its Contemporary Hit Radio format. Its moniker at the time, \\"San Diego's New Q - Q96,\\" referenced San Diego's legendary KCBQ, a popular Top 40 station in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The main transmitter is located east of Lake Morena, just west of Campo. To better cover San Diego, a booster station was also set up, also on 96.1 MHz. It is located atop Mount San Miguel along with several other FM and TV transmitters, including those of television stations KUSI and KNSD. The booster is licensed for 700 watts effective radiated power. Booster site problems (2010-2012) The booster site went through a long period of non-operation and problems from late October 2010 through July 2011. On early morning October 22, 2010 the booster transmitter went silent, transmitting a dead carrier. Cheery Creek Radio, the owners of KSIQ, applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a Silent STA: A \\"special temporary authority\\" to retain their license despite not being on the air. The application stated that the T1 link to the booster transmitter failed, that troubleshooting was underway, and that they intended to return to the air as soon as possible. On Tuesday, November 16, 2010, KSIQ was heard in San Diego again. But on January 24, 2011 the San Diego Radio blog reported that KSIQ's relay on Mount San Miguel was not operating, and the signal from the main transmitter in Campo was not reaching San Diego. On March 31, 2011, the station's management requested special temporary authority (STA) to operate the booster transmitter with temporary facilities from an alternate site. The site proposed was just west of Sweetwater Reservoir, about four miles west of the Mount San Miguel location. The STA request also included a significant increase in transmitter power for the booster, from 700 watts ERP to 5,000 watts ERP, but also noted that the new site would be at just 137 meters above sea level (compared to 785 meters for the booster site on Mount San Miguel) and that the new antenna's height would be nine meters below the average terrain. This request was granted on April 5. The station intended to file an application for permanent use of the new site if it proved successful. However, the new site and increased power did not improve reception. The old booster site on Mount San Miguel resumed operation in July 2011 with 700 watts ERP. On May 24, 2012, KSIQ's booster went off the air yet again. This was simultaneous with KPBS-FM's report that their transmitter, also on San Miguel, had lost power, apparently due to a brush fire that affected the incoming lines. However KPBS's signal was restored the next day, while KSIQ's booster was not back on the air until July 11, 2012, almost two months later. EMF Acquisition, Format changes (2013-present) On November 1, 2013, Cherry Creek Radio announced its intention to sell KSIQ to the Educational Media Foundation, operator of two Christian radio networks, K-Love, which plays Contemporary Christian music, and Air 1, which leaned toward Christian rock at the time of the announcement. \\"Q96\\" signed off on November 6, at 5:45 pm, and entered a fifteen minute period of silence. At 6:00pm that night, KSIQ flipped to Christian rock and began airing programming from Air 1. The sale was finalized on January 27, 2014 at a price of $1 million. KSIQ became KYDO that same day. With the acquisition, this station became the first religious station on FM to reach the San Diego metropolitan Area, and the first to reach Downtown. The station shifted to CCM in 2017. EMF also acquired KYDQ, a station in North County at 92.1 FM, and converted it to a repeater station on November 16 of that year, the KYDQ calls resembled KYDO. On January 1, 2019, at midnight, KYDO, like all other Air 1 affiliates, flipped to its present worship music format.

It took place near the Hill of Tara in Ireland in the year 980. The battle was a devastating defeat for the Vikings and led to the Irish regaining control of Dublin. Description On one side there was a Norse army from the Kingdom of Dublin supported by troops from the Hebrides, which was commanded by a son of Olaf Cuaran named Ragnall. The other side was led by M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill, who had recently come to power as head of the southern U√≠ N√©ill. The latter's force consisted of troops from his home province of Mide (the Kingdom of Meath), probably with strong support from troops from Leinster and Ulster. The battle ended in a devastating defeat for the Norse of Dublin, called a \\"red slaughter\\" in the Annals of the Four Masters. Olaf abdicated and died in religious retirement in Iona. Dublin was besieged by the victorious M√°el Sechnaill, who forced it to surrender slaves and valuables, as well as give up all its prior claims to U√≠ N√©ill-held territory. In the following decade, Dublin was more or less under the control of M√°el Sechnaill and the Southern U√≠ N√©ill. The Battle of Tara is regarded as a far more decisive defeat for the Norse of Dublin than the later, and much more famous, Battle of Clontarf.

Beautiful Katamari is the fourth game in the Katamari series of games following Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari and Me & My Katamari. Beautiful Katamari has gained extra attention because it was originally scheduled as a PlayStation 3 title in addition to the Xbox 360, but development on the PlayStation 3 was abandoned and Beautiful Katamari was released for the Xbox 360 alone. All previous Katamari games had been exclusively available on Sony consoles. Story The game opens with the King of All Cosmos, his Queen, and the Prince, enjoying some tennis while on vacation. However, a powerful serve by the King causes the tennis ball to rip through the fabric of the universe, creating a black hole that sucks everything but the planet Earth into it. In order to correct it, the King commands the Prince to roll up katamaris on Earth to recreate the planets, sun, and other celestial features. Once the Prince completes this, the King then orders him to create a katamari large enough to plug up the black hole and restore order to the universe. The Prince then rolls up enough stuff to create the \\"Super Giant\\", a very large Katamari that he then clogs up the black hole with. In the end, the black hole is stopped and the King of All Cosmos takes all the credit for stopping it. Gameplay Typical gameplay screenshot The core gameplay from the Katamari Damacy series is unchanged; the player, as the diminutive Prince, controls a \\"katamari\\" to collect objects smaller than the katamari, causing the katamari to grow and collect even larger objects, as to meet various objectives given by the King of All Cosmos. After successfully clearing any level once, the player can then attempt a time attack challenge on that level to make a katamari of a given size in the shortest time possible. Eternal modes, where the player is allowed to roll without any time limits, are available once a perfect score is obtained on a level. The player can also change to another character that the second player also uses- Marcy. In Beautiful Katamari, players are urged to build katamari with specific types of items. For example, to make the planet Mercury, the King asks the player to collect liquids. After successfully completing the task, the player is rated on time, size, and the number of objects meeting the King's request. Another level requires that the player roll up only hot items and avoid cold items to raise the katamari's temperature to 10,000 degrees Celsius. Beautiful Katamari is the first game in the series to support high- definition television resolutions of 720p, 1080i and 1080p. Multiplayer modes include 2 player support on the same console and 2-4 player support over Xbox Live in both cooperative and competitive modes. One of the online battle types is a \\"Thingy Battle\\", similar to a mode in We Love Katamari, where each player must collect the most of a specific type of item. Game lobbies include simple mini-games. The game tracks all progress by the player in the various modes and shares this data through Xbox Live to allow the player to compare their performance to others, including on normal request levels, time attacks, and online play performance (tracked as \\"cookies\\" awarded by the King). A \\"worldwide katamari\\", representing the total size of all objects rolled up by all Xbox Live players and the player's contribution to that, is also available. Downloadable content Beautiful Katamari is the first game in the series to include downloadable content. Seven additional levels are available individually from the Xbox Live Marketplace.Downloadable: Beautiful Katamari DLC Available in Japan/Asia Each additional level occupies only about 384 kB on the Xbox 360 console's hard drive, leading game reviewer Aaron Linde to complain that the game was shipped feature-complete but crippled unless players paid additional money. One of the Beautiful Katamari achievements explicitly requires that the player \\"download stages\\" to be able to build a 1,500,000 km katamari. Additional downloads available on the U.S. Xbox Live Marketplace immediately unlock ten cousins or presents at a time. These downloads do not introduce new cousins or presents into the game; they merely work around the game's need to have the player find these hidden objects. Downloadable content for the European market was released May 7, though mistakes were made with the item names, resulting in two items named \\"Perfectly Sized Katamari\\" with identical descriptions and only an image to differentiate the two. There are 6 additional levels available for download on EU Xbox Live Marketplace. History and development Artist, designer, and creator of the previous Katamari Damacy titles, Keita Takahashi, was not involved with Beautiful Katamari, which was directed by Me & My Katamari co- lead game designer Jun Moriwaki. Early in 2007, various reports suggested that Beautiful Katamari was in development and might be released in North America in Autumn 2007. These reports were based on a United States trademark filing, retailer listings, and a reported announcement by Namco Bandai to retailers. A demo was distributed in the September 2007 issue of Official Xbox Magazine and on the Xbox Live Marketplace on August 14, 2007. The demo spawns the player in one of several starting points in a single level with a three-minute time limit and an 80 cm katamari. The main menu features the song Nananan Katamari. The demo level contains a song called Katamari Dancing by Takashi Utsunomiya which is also the opening song. According to a press release from Namco Bandai, Beautiful Katamari went gold on October 2, 2007.Press Releases - NAMCO BANDAI Games America Inc The game was released in North America on October 16, 2007, on October 18, 2007 in Japan and was released on February 29, 2008 in Europe. PlayStation 3 and Wii development A March 16, 2007 post at Orange Lounge Radio reported that Namco Bandai announced Beautiful Katamari to retailers, which included a release for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii. According to the post, the PlayStation 3 version of Beautiful Katamari was to feature support for the motion-sensing feature of the Sixaxis Wireless Controller. The post was removed at the request of Namco Bandai. In mid-April 2007, the game was confirmed by Famitsu to be in development for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan, and officially announced by Namco Bandai Games America on April 20. Both versions of the game were stated to retain the dual analog control scheme of the PlayStation 2 Katamari games, and also include online play features. Designer Jun Moriwaki stated in April 2007 that while a Wii version of Beautiful Katamari was under consideration, difficulties are presented by the system's controller that must first be resolved. On June 29, 2007, IGN Nintendo editor-in-chief Matt Casamassina reported that according to unnamed sources close to Namco Bandai, the PlayStation 3 edition of Beautiful Katamari had been cancelled due to porting issues and stalled PlayStation 3 sales, with resources being redirected towards the development of a Wii version. Namco Bandai was contacted for comment, but a statement was not returned in time for the publishing of the report. On July 5, 2007 Namco revealed their E3 2007 lineup, listing Beautiful Katamari as Xbox 360 only.Namco unveils E3 2007 lineup - Gaming Age On the same day, Famitsu reported that Beautiful Katamari had been cancelled for the PS3 and was currently in development for the Wii and Xbox 360. The box cover image for the Xbox 360 version, released in late August 2007, indicates that the game is exclusive to the Xbox 360.EBgames.com On September 11, 2007, Namco-Bandai's U.S. website briefly identified Beautiful Katamari as a title for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii, with the latter two platforms bearing a release date of \\"TBD.\\" When asked by 1UP during the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Beautiful Katamari director Jun Morikawa stated specifically that the game will not be available for the PS3, though another Katamari game that stars the King of Cosmos in the lead will make its way to the PS3 \\"soon\\". Morikawa also suggested the same for the Wii. Due to the PlayStation 3 version cancelled, Namco later released Katamari Forever, which shares some of its levels with Beautiful Katamari, for that console in 2009. Reception Beautiful Katamari received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review score aggregator Metacritic. Official Xbox Magazine stated, \\"It clearly aims to include everyone and exclude no one, and that's just plain refreshing amid a holiday season stuffed full of deadly serious, high-learning-curve me-toos.\\" IGN gave the game a 7.8 out of 10, calling Beautiful Katamari \\"a welcome addition to the barren category of family friendly games on 360,\\" but also found fault in the game's short length and the lack of evolution in the Katamari series. Other critics lamented the lack of originality in Beautiful Katamari. Game Informer called the game the \\"ugly duckling\\" of the Katamari series, praising the new multiplayer facilities but calling the environments \\"dull and lifeless.\\" Import-centric UK site NTSC-uk gave it 6/10, saying, \\"When throwing in the short nature of the game and the lack of loving care to the little things that seemed to be lavished on its predecessors... then fans of the series may be left feeling somewhat disappointed. Newcomers will no doubt discover the reason why so many people hold the series very dear to their heart...\\" As of December 27, 2007, Beautiful Katamari is the 25th best-selling Xbox 360 title in Japan at 24,186 copies sold.

The first is a lack of orientation, vision or ethical > practices in the exercise of political, economic, media, and technological > power by those who hold it. Neither States nor multinational corporations > nor other holders of effective power appear to express this vision. The > United Nations identified the objectives to be achieved in order to respond > to the major challenges of the new century; however, its normative function > is weakened by the fragmentation of competences, between the various > international organizations, and by the absence of an integrated mechanism, > such as a world human rights jurisdiction, which would control the effective > and indivisible application of all fundamental rights, whether civil, > political, economic, cultural and/or social. This ethical weakness is all > the more serious given that there is an increasing deficit of > responsibility: as globalization occurs, power is concentrated, but > responsibility becomes diluted. Today, effective power is disseminated > between economic, political, media, social, cultural, intellectual and > religious players, without clearly predetermining the conditions and means > of their responsibility with regard to the peoples and citizens concerned. > The second is the growing impact on human beings and the ecosystems, of the > physical, biological, and atmospheric degradation of our world, with > consequences manifested in a sporadic manner through droughts (and > consequent desertification), floods, cyclones, climatic changes and the > threats of irreversible pollution. The programs advocated at the world > Conferences of Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and Johannesburg in 2002 for dealing > with such threats, already insufficient solutions in relation to the risks, > are afterwards ignored or misinterpreted. The third reason for alarm is the > widening gulf between rich and poor, exemplified by the fact that more than > two-thirds of the world's population today are deprived of their political, > economic and cultural human rights, in contradiction with the promises that > have been formulated by the international community since the adoption of > the legal instruments drafted by the United Nations. Our primary indicators, > which are principally monetary, are leading us towards a market society > guided by pure economics. Globalization thus works to the detriment of the > majority of humanity by destroying its ecological backbone. The > informational mutation is failing to attain the promises that it has been > holding. The weight accorded to true riches ‚Äî those of intelligence and life > ‚Äî should however lead us to take the only possible route: a renaissance of > ethical, ecological and anthropological fundamentals. The fourth reason > resides in the growing risks of war and terrorism, and in the absence of > ways to curb rising violence and barbarity, which indicate that humanity > today is principally threatened by its own inhumanity. However, the > possibility of humanity's self-destruction makes it its own victim, while > being in charge of its own history. The stakes of an ethical and spiritual > responsibility are thus becoming major political issues that must be treated > within the framework of a genuine dialogue between civilizations. In order > to come forward with a pertinent response to these risks and challenges ‚Äî > replacing science, economics and technology in the realm of means and not of > ends - the construction of world civility requires an entity, which is not > subject to the constraints of particular interests, to media obsession, or > to short-term pressure. This established fact is now the driving force > behind the creation of an International Ethical, Political and Scientific > Collegium that has a quadruple function: To be vigilant and alert regarding > the principal risks faced by humanity; To apply discernment, in particular > ethical, as to the nature of these risks and the quality of the means which > are necessary for dealing with them, without such means becoming themselves > counter-productive; To deliberate in the event of major conflicts, which > call for an ethical framework; To give advice to governments and > international institutions (primarily the United Nations) in order to > clarify their decision-making procedures. An appeal for an acute awareness > of world interdependence, an idea that was predominant during the drafting > of the United Nations Charter, appears necessary. This appeal reflects the > joint responsibilities of Statesmen and -women as well as of men and women > relevant in the different fields that affect the life of the planet and the > thinking of its people. These voices must also make themselves heard through > the world network of civil society that has taken shape during the last > decade. As a follow-up to the Preamble of the Declaration of Rio which, for > the first time, proclaimed that \\"the Earth, home of humanity, constitutes a > whole denoted by interdependence\\", this appeal takes the form of a general > Declaration, recalling that if interdependence has become a reality, it is > also time to formulate it as a project.

Until the municipal reform of 1972, Karise was part of its own Karise Municipality. Karise Church The church is built as a fortified church which served as a place of refuge during wendish incursions in the 13th century. At that time the stream on the east side of the church was a navigable fjord, rendering the surrounding villages an easy target for the wendish pirates. The architecture of the church displays both romanesque and gothic style features. The windows in the apse are romanesque round arches while the windows in the nave are gothic pointed arches. The double function of the church as both of a fortress and a church can be seen in the unusual design of having two church towers. One of the towers has later been lowered to give the church a more classic Danish church look. The larger tower also still have archer holes. The yellow and grey memorial chapel on the southern side of the church was built in 1766-1769 by Count A. G. Moltke and designed by C. F. Harsdorff. The neo-classical style of the chapel contrasts the medieval brickwork of the church. The Town The original village was situated northwest of the church. A large part of the village was consumed in a great fire in 1804 and never rebuilt since the village was undergoing enclosure. Modern day Karise is centered on the railway station which was built in 1879. The railway connects Karise with neighbouring towns Faxe and H√•rlev as well as K√∏ge and Copenhagen. Karise in fiction According to the legend of Mrs. Marthe, her estate Kariseg√•rd was destroyed by wendish pirates. Mrs. Marthe fled to a small chamber above the apse of Karise Church and remained there until her property was reconstructed. Poet and novelist B. S. Ingemann mentions the fictive person Karl of Riise in his historic novel Valdemar the Victorius (Danish: Valdemar Seier). Karl of Riise was a squire of archbishop Anders Sunesen during the Northern Crusades against the Estonians. In the Battle of Lindanise in 1219, Karl af Rise is mentioned as being the person who caught the Danish flag, Dannebrog, when it fell from the sky. Karise is mentioned in a few folk songs. Most famous are \\"Lille fregnede Louise (fra Karise)\\" and \\"Slikkehans\\". Karise is also mentioned in the comedy song \\"Syd for K√∏ge\\" by Monrad & Rislund. The title of the Danish national play Elves' Hill (Danish: Elverh√∏j) refers to a small mound situated 2.5 kilometers northeast of Karise.

He was chosen at the very last minute to stand for Parliament, and eventually served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for nineteen years. He was described as a member of the 'old school' of trade union leaders, and proud of it.\\"Capt. Mark Hewitson\\" (obituary), The Times, 1 March 1973. First World War Hewitson was born in Consett, County Durham where he went to the local council school. He was a convinced socialist and joined the Labour Party in 1914. Later that year, he joined the Northumberland Fusiliers, and went to fight in the First World War. From 1916 he was in the West Yorkshire Regiment until his discharge in 1920. Trade Union activities In 1927 Hewitson became a trade union official with the General and Municipal Workers' Union in the north-east of England. He was based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and was an area organiser. He was elected to Durham County Council in 1930. From 1937, Hewitson was President of the International Trade Secretariat for the Public and Civil Service, a post which involved many visits to continental Europe where he became well known. Hewitson served on the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1939‚Äì40. Second World War After the outbreak of the Second World War, Hewitson was one of the first national trade union leaders to leave some of his posts and volunteer to serve in the armed forces. He was commissioned into the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps in 1940, but resigned his commission due to ill health in 1941, by which time he was a Captain. Subsequently, he became chief industrial officer for his union, and was involved in preventing unlawful strikes: in October 1944 he protested against a dockers' strike in Newcastle, saying that the dockers were now out of hand and the union was no longer responsible for their actions.\\"Troops As Dockers\\", The Times, 3 October 1944. He was elected to a five-year term as President of the International Federation of General Factory Workers in 1945. Member of Parliament During the 1945 general election campaign on 29 June 1945, the sitting Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull Central Walter Windsor died. Polling was postponed to allow the party time to choose its replacement, and on 5 July Hewitson was chosen. In the last result of the election, he easily held the seat. Later, questions were raised about his election due to his membership of trade boards appointed by the Minister of Labour; however, the Select Committee on Elections reported that they were not offices \\"of profit\\" and so did not invalidate his election.\\"Captain Hewitson's election\\", The Times, 8 March 1946. Hewitson was again elected to the Labour Party National Executive Committee from 1947 to 1953, nominated in the section for trade unions. He remained involved in his union and spoke to the Trade Union Congress in 1949 calling for the TUC to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions, which was communist- dominated.\\"Trades Union Congress\\", The Times, 7 September 1949; \\"T.U.C. Defeat For Communists\\", The Times, 7 September 1949. At the 1950 general election, Hewitson defeated his Conservative opponent R.D. Wilberforce, a descendant of William Wilberforce who had been Member of Parliament for Hull when he began his famous campaign against slavery.\\"Wars Of The Rosettes\\", The Times, 21 February 1950. Anti-Bevanism During the Bevanite campaign of the early 1950s, Hewitson supported the leadership. He made a speech in his constituency in August 1952 insisting that differences of opinion within the Labour Party \\"did not require the existence of private and conspiratorial groups\\".\\"Labour M.P. On Party Discipline\\", The Times, 14 August 1952. In 1953 he was replaced as GMWU candidate for the National Executive Committee, and ran instead in the constituency parties section, but came bottom of the poll.\\"Executive Officers\\", The Times, 1 October 1953. In 1954, Hewitson \\"talked out\\" a Private Member's Bill introduced by Frederick Mulley which called for publication of football pools promoters' accounts.\\"Pool Promoters' Action\\", The Times, 11 February 1954. After boundary changes, Hewitson was returned for Kingston upon Hull West. Representing many fishermen, he moved a motion in Parliament to stop a proposed doubling in the levy for the White Fish Authority in September 1956.\\"Appeal Against Higher Fish Levy\\", The Times, 29 October 1956. Retirement In April 1960 Hewitson announced that he would not fight the next election, on medical advice.\\"Hull M.P. not to stand again\\", The Times, 13 April 1960. He was involved in a scandal in March 1964 when a girl from South Shields who was working as a club hostess in London claimed that Hewitson, who was a club regular, had given her money and made advances on her after inviting her to his flat. She had pleaded guilty to theft of cheque books from his flat.\\"Girl Tells Of Visits To M.P.'s Flat\\", The Times, 24 March 1964.

It was released on Endtime Productions and then Solid State Records the following year. According to Allmusic, Burial was \\"a breath of fresh air among a genre that relies on satanic gimmicks\\", and marked a renewal in the Christian metal scene. In 2010, HM magazine ranked it #13 on the Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list.  Recording  Burial was recorded at B√∏rud Lydskredderi, Norway, mastered at The Mastering Room, and released on 22 December 1998. Burial was the first release by the Swedish record label Endtime Productions. Critics and fans usually categorize the album's style as either death/black metal or simply metal because it contains elements of several subgenres of heavy metal music. The notable black metal elements on the album include the high-pitched shrieking vocals of Peter Espevoll, some black metal tremolo riffs, such as on \\"Innbydelse\\", and the slightly raw sound production. However, the album's overall atmosphere is not particularly dark or cold; on several songs the soundscape contains happy sounding elements such as the cheerful power metal vocals of the guitarist Ole B√∏rud, creating tensions between the darker elements. The musical output of Burial is a combination of power metal, old school death metal and traditional heavy metal, and the latter style is especially apparent on the main riff of \\"Renhetens Elv\\". Additionally, the songs contain interludes that include elements of industrial music, such as on the song \\"Justified\\", jazz and classical music, such as on the song \\"Tears of Bitterness\\". The guest musician Maria Riddervold played violin on the songs \\"Embraced\\" and \\"Tears of Bitterness\\". The musicianship on Burial is virtuoisic, taking the style a step towards technical death metal and progressive death metal, technically exceptionally precise, and contains experimental, bizarre song structures.

The DVD was released in February 2007. The movie celebrates the 30 year anniversary of the Super Sentai Series. Plot The movie starts with Time Demon Chronos meeting with High Priest Gajya on getting rid of the Boukengers while obtaining three Goodomu Engines. As they plot, a mysterious figure watches above them. Afterwards, the Boukenger, excluding Bouken Silver, were summoned to battle some Curse. After their battle, they see Gajya and Chronos, with Chronos sending the Boukengers to a different dimension. Eiji was alerted of the situation, but before he could set out to rescue the other Boukengers, a mysterious figure named Aka Red, who describes himself as the embodiment of the fighting spirit of all Red Sentai Warriors, meets him and gives him the Super Sentai Address Book, which lists information on every Super Sentai member. He opens it to find Tsubasa Ozu, a.k.a. Magi Yellow from Mahou Sentai Magiranger. Eiji tries to talk to Tsubasa during his boxing match, but ends up getting ejected from the side of the ring since he was interfering with his match. Next, Tetsu, a.k.a. Deka Break from Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger, is undercover trying to negotiate with Alienizers when Eiji interrupts. Eiji tries to acknowledge Tetsu's background as Deka Break, but Tetsu beats him up and sends him out the window to maintain his cover. Elsewhere, at the Duel Bond site, Chronos shows a time device, a reverse flowing hourglass, to Gajya, which when augmented to a Goodomu Engine enable him to revive one of the Three Sorcerers, past Super Sentai villains whose magic caused the greatest harm to the Earth. Chronos would set another up at the Matrix ruins with Gajya remaining to welcome the second Sorcerer while Chronos installed the final device at the countryside. In Chronos' time prison, the Boukengers find out they were blocked of their technology and they meet up with Hikaru, a.k.a. Magi Shine, also from Mahou Sentai Magiranger. Eiji then receives a call through his GoGo Changer from Asuka, a.k.a. Abare Black from Bakury≈´ Sentai Abaranger, all the way from Dino Earth while taking care of his daughter. He tells Eiji that Aka Red contacted him, but the connection to Earth is weak since the power of the dimension door is weak as well. Even contacting him was hard through the GoGo Changer. He loses connection to Eiji after a few minutes. While Chronos set up his time devices, Hikaru talks to the Boukengers about Chronos and the Boukengers are introduced to Smokey, although at first mistaking him as precious. Eiji then tries to meet Nanami Nono, a.k.a. Hurricane Blue from Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger, before her rehearsal, but is blocked by security and many fans. In a desperate attempt to catch Nanami's attention, Eiji shouts out \\"Hurricane Blue,\\" which Nanami is surprised by. Chronos was then successful in summoning Meemy, from Mahou Sentai Magiranger, who meets up with Chronos. In frustration, Eiji throws out the Super Sentai Address Book and decides to battle Meemy and Chronos on his own. After Eiji is overpowered, he was rescued by Hurricane Blue, Abare Black, Deka Break and Magi Yellow. However, the various Super Sentai warriors repeatedly get in each other's way and Meemy and Chronos were able to escape. In the time prison, Satoru reveals that he has Zubaan with him. TsueTsue from Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger was then revived and welcomed by Gajya. At SGS, Eiji receives a message from Satoru concerning Chronos. The Super Sentai warriors then promised to help Eiji rescue the rest of the Boukengers and meet Aka Red while the time prison holding the Boukengers and Hikaru is slowly disappearing. Chronos and the other villains found the last hourglass tipped over, with the final Sorcerer missing, when they were attacked by the Super Sentai warriors. As the time prison started to disintegrate, Sakura analyzed and concluded that the clock with root-like designs in the wall was the key to their escape. The Boukengers and Hikaru then utilize the Magi Lamp Buster's Smoky Shining Attack, accompanied by Zubaan, on the clock in the wall. Although this does not damage the clock at all, it causes another root-like clock in the real world to appear. Aka Red orders the other warriors to destroy the clock while he takes care of the villains, transforming into Magi Red and Gao Red respectively, and frightening both Meemy and TsueTsue in the process; for both respective villains, Magi Red and Gao Red were their worst enemies. As Aka Red fights off the villains, the others succeed in freeing the Boukengers and Magi Shine from the alternate dimension. The Super Sentai warriors and the villains face off, with the Sentai warriors getting the upper hand until Furabiijo from Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanger interferes after \\"taking a walk\\". But with all three Sorcerers present and accounted, Chronos fuses them all into the Staff of the Three Philosophers, his intended goal from the start. With the power of the staff, Chronos enabled himself to grow to gigantic proportions with new golden armor. The Boukengers countered with Ultimate DaiBouken and SirenBuilder, but Chronos proved too powerful for both the mecha and were defeated. In a last-ditch effort, the Boukengers summoned DaiVoyager, which was almost defeated by Chronos as well. Aka Red, sensing the danger, came back into the action, becoming a vessel to power up DaiVoyager using the Spirits given by the remaining Super Sentai warriors, enabling DaiVoyager to access its Burning Legend form. Burning Legend DaiVoyager went on to defeat Chronos with the special attack, 30 Super Sentai Soul (an energy attack powered by the Super Sentai warriors of the past), and sent the released sorcerers back into the afterlife. After their victory, the Boukengers and the other Super Sentai warriors return to the SGS headquarters, and then parted ways. The Boukengers, however, would not have time to relax, as they receive another call from Mr. Voice concerning another Negative Syndicate on the move. The movie ends with Aka Red watching over the Earth in outer space, going into a deep sleep until he is needed again. Characters=NewAka Red= is the Spirit of the Super Sentai's Red Warriors. He has all of the powers of all of the Red Warriors, except Bouken Red. He leads the veteran Super Sentai warriors in the fight against Time Demon Chronos and his associates. Using his power of , he transforms into two of the past 30 warriors, Hyakujuu Sentai Gaorangers Gao Red and Mahou Sentai Magirangers Magi Red, the latter of which is Tsubasa's younger brother and Hikaru's brother-in-law. This power even recreates the henshin initiation gestures, the henshin sequence, roll call, and signature weapons and attacks. He also uses weapons from Bakury≈´ Sentai Abarangers Aba Red, Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanegers Hurricane Red, and Tokusou Sentai Dekarangers Deka Red. During his roll call, he quickly transforms into the aforementioned Red warriors in chronological order (from Gao Red to Magi Red). Design-wise, he is based on the first Red Warrior, Himitsu Sentai Gorangers Aka Ranger and the thickness of his spandex recalls the cloth suits used from Goranger to Dai Sentai Goggle-V. The logo of the 30th Anniversary is on his left chest, while his belt buckle is made of the Roman numeral for the number 30 (XXX). He also possesses a fire motif, the common element of most Red Warriors, such as Gosei Sentai Dairangers Ryu Ranger, Seijuu Sentai Gingamans Ginga Red, Gao Red, Deka Red, Magi Red, and even Bouken Red himself. Before battle, he recites One who inherits the souls of the red warriors! Aka Red! *In episode 39 of the future Super Sentai series, Engine Sentai Go-Onger, Aka Red's helmet appears as one of the nine faces on the monster Yatai Banki's yatai, though the passive mask has no connection to the character from the Boukenger V-Cinema which premiered two years earlier; its appearance is merely trivial. *Aka Red returns in the 35th anniversary series Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger. In the series, his suit is redesigned with a 35 on chest to represent the 35th anniversary of Super Sentai. It is revealed that he was the leader of the Red Pirates - the largest rebel group to resist the Space Empire Zangyack. But when Basco ta Jolokia betrayed the group and sided with the Zangyack Empire, Aka Red handed Captain Marvelous the Ranger Keys, making him promise to find the Greatest Treasure in the Universe before disappearing in battle. Aka Red also made an appearance in Gokaiger Goseiger Super Sentai 199 Hero Great Battle. AkaRed is voiced by Tohru Furuya. =Chronos= is the V-Cinema's main antagonist. As his name suggests, he has the ability to control time, using a reverse flowing hourglass to revive past Super Sentai villains. He also imprisoned the Boukenger and Magi Shine in a time prison filled with cogs. Although he seems to fit into the theme of the enemies from Mahou Sentai Magiranger, he's fittingly based on Mirai Sentai Timerangers Providus. Chronos is voiced by Bunk≈ç Ogata. Past Super SentaiNanami Nono= has a career as a singer nowadays. Eiji finds her before her concert. To power up DaiVoyager, she gives Aka Red the Spirit of Friendship.

He calls Eiji through the Dino Commander while simultaneously doing laundry and minding his newest child. Instead of wearing his armor like he did when he briefly returned to Another Earth in Dekaranger vs. Abaranger, he wears his Dino House jacket. To power up DaiVoyager, he gives Aka Red the Spirit of Passion. Kaoru Abe reprises his role as Asuka from Bakury≈´ Sentai Abaranger. =Tekkan Aira= , nicknamed , is still a member of the SPD Earth Branch, working undercover when Eiji first met him but was forced to throw Eiji out to prevent his cover from being blown, but later apologizes for it.

It is located near the Flensburg Fjord just south of the easternmost part of the Danish-German border. Overview Kupferm√ºhle belonged to Bov Parish until the establishment of the present border, when the rest of the parish became Danish following the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites. The village now belongs to the Gemeinde Harrislee. Kupferm√ºhle was the home of the first factory in Schleswig, which is the reason behind the settlement's name. The copper mill was founded by king Christian IV of Denmark in 1612 and produced finished copper products and later also products in brass. Among its products were pipes and sheet copper for copper roofs but also utensils such as buckets, pots, kettles and candlesticks. The copper production flourished in 1914 when the factory employed more than 200 workers. It went bankrupt in 1962. Both the 17th century factory buildings and the workers' residences are preserved. The latter are known in Danish as nyboder and show great similarities with Christian's contemporary buildings in the Copenhagen district of Nyboder. The village is now home to a museum which displays a large number of copper and brass products produced by the mill. Many of the residents in Kupferm√ºhle belong to the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig. A Danish school, Kobberm√∏lle Skole, is located in the neighbouring village, Wassersleben.

He is also the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the Middle East and North Africa. Kabil served as an officer in the Military of Egypt's Special Forces before becoming a promising actor in Egyptian cinema during the 1970s. Blacklisted in 1980, Kabil moved to the United States and took a 14-year hiatus from acting. He made a successful comeback upon his return to Egypt in 1993, and has since starred in more than 50 films and TV series on his way to becoming one of Egypt's most popular actors. After years of involvement with the United Nations, Kabil was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in November 2003.  Life & career  Mahmoud Kabil was born in Cairo, Egypt. His father, Dr. Ibrahim Kabil, was head of the internal revenue service in Alexandria and the Western provinces as well as the Minister of Finance in the shadow government of the Saadi opposition party before the 1952 coup. At his death in 1959, Mahmoud was 12. Kabil was educated at the Lycee Francais of Alexandria before joining the Military of Egypt in 1964 at the age of 18. Serving until 1973 as an officer and captain in the Special Forces, Kabil participated in the Yemen War, the Six-Day War, and the War of Attrition. Prior to his decision to enlist, Kabil was approached by director Youssef Chahine about starring in one of his films. Though Kabil declined the offer at the time, he would later renew ties with Chahine after his service in the military. Chahine, credited with launching the career of Omar Sharif, took Kabil under his wing and established him as a promising young actor in Egyptian cinema during the 1970s. Some of Kabil's more notable films during this period include Chahine's The Sparrow, Love Under the Rain (based on the Naguib Mahfouz novel), and The Damned (an adaptation of King Lear). Kabil spent the last years of the 1970s attempting to have a short story he penned, Sinai 73, turned into a full-length film. Based on his experience of capturing Israeli pilot Yair Barak in the Six-Day War in 1967, the film was ideally to be a joint American-Israeli-Egyptian production that would highlight the possibility of peace between Egypt and Israel. By 1979, Dustin Hoffman had signed on to play the role of Kabil's prisoner for $3.5 million, but the project ultimately never advanced past the preliminary stages due to Sadat's assassination. United Studios of Israel approached Kabil to produce the film independent of Egyptian involvement, but he declined. After a visit to Israel in March 1980, Kabil was subsequently blacklisted by the League of Arab States and threatened by radical terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization. Unable to find work as an actor, Kabil left to the United States in 1981. Kabil returned to Egypt in 1993 to attempt an acting comeback. He found initial success with audiences and critics alike with the films Penalty (1994) and Cheap Meat (1995). Since then, Kabil has starred in more than 50 films and TV series on his way to becoming one of Egypt's most popular actors. The bulk of his notoriety lies in television series, particularly those aired during the Ramadan season. He is most remembered for his roles in Ladies of Garden City (Haw√¢nim G√¢rden Cit√Æ) (1998), Where is My Heart? (Ayna Qalb√Æ) (2003), and Amar 14 (2008). Involvement with UNICEF After years of involvement with the United Nations, Kabil was named the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the Middle East and North Africa in November 2003. He has spoken publicly about several important issues concerning children in the Middle Eastern region, including the plight of the children in Gaza, Darfur, and Yemen, Female Immunization, Female Genital Mutilation, HIV/AIDS, and the education of young girls. He has also been an outspoken critic of the Darfur genocide. Following a visit to the region, Kabil appealed to the Arab countries to play a more active role in offering support to UNICEF activities designed to help the women and children who have carried the brunt of the conflict. In the aftermath of the Gaza Crisis, Kabil in February 2009 paid a visit to the El- Arish Hospital near the Gaza border crossing in Rafah. He met with injured Palestinian children and pledged UNICEF support to the development of an effective and speedy relief effort. He concluded 2009 with a trip to Yemen and a joint visit to Gaza with fellow UNICEF Ambassador Mia Farrow. Kabil currently resides in San Antonio, Texas, USA.

The series has had a long running history, first appearing in 1932 as a comics magazine. It is currently published by Panini Comics. Topolino giornale (1932‚Äì1949) In 1932 the editor Mario Nerbini decided to open a new weekly newspaper for kids, containing illustrated tales with Mickey Mouse. The first issue of Topolino was published on December 31, 1932: it contained Mickey's first Italian story drawn by Giove Toppi. In this story, Mickey Mouse was chased by an elephant. However Nerbini, hadn't correctly secured the publication rights, so when Emmanuel (Disney's representative in Italy) protested, Nerbini changed the title of the comic book with issue #3 into Topo Lino (Mouse Lino), replacing Mickey Mouse with Topo Lino, another mouse. When Nerbini bought the publication rights from Disney and King Features Syndicate, he changed the title back to Topolino with issue #5. Floyd Gottfredson's stories made their debut in Topolino #7 with a Sunday page featuring Mickey, his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, and Mickey's nephews Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse. Topolino published mainly Mickey Mouse Sunday pages; the daily strips were published in the supplement to the newspaper. Topolino had eight pages and also published non-Disney comic strips such as Tim Tyler's Luck (Cino e Franco). In 1935 Topolino published Bobo the Elephant, Mickey Mouse and the sacred jewel and Mickey Mouse and Pluto the racer. The same year the publishing house Mondadori bought the newspaper; the first issue published by Mondadori was #137. In 1937 Topolino and I tre porcellini, Mondadori's newspapers for kids, merged into Topolino - Grandi avventure (\\"Mickey Mouse - Great adventures\\"). The number of the pages of the weekly increased from eight to sixteen. The first page published a story in instalments by Floyd Gottfredson starring Mickey Mouse and his friends; the other pages published American stories such as Tim Tyler's Luck as well as Italian stories such as Saturno contro la Terra, a story by Federico Pedrocchi in which Rebo (the dictator of Saturn, who later appeared as Donald Duck's enemy in four Italian stories drawn by Luciano Bottaro) made his debut. December 1937 also saw the publication of a companion newspaper, Paperino e altre avventure (Donald Duck and Other Adventures), which ran for three years before being merged with Topolino in October 1940. In 1938, Mussolini's fascist government forbade the publishing of American stories except Disney stories (his children liked Mickey Mouse). Topolino continued to publish Mickey Mouse stories until February 3, 1942 (#477, containing the last episode of Mickey Mouse in love trouble) when they were forced by the fascist government to stop publishing Mickey's stories. For two years, Mickey Mouse was replaced by Tuffolino, a human character very similar to Mickey. Tuffolino made his debut in Tuffolino agente di pubblicit√†, a remake (starring non-Disney characters) of American story Mickey Mouse, super salesman (1941). Tuffolino and his friends (Mimma, Clara) very much resembled Mickey, Minnie and Clarabelle Cow. Tuffolino's stories were written by Pedrocchi and drawn by Pier Lorenzo De Vita. The newspaper had to cease all publications in December 1943 (#564). In December 1945, Mondadori resumed publication of Topolino. Because of the fall of fascism in Italy, Mondadori could once again publish Mickey Mouse stories by Floyd Gottfredson. Topolino also began publishing Donald Duck stories by Carl Barks. Topolino #713 published the first episode of Topolino e il cobra bianco, written by Guido Martina and drawn by Angelo Bioletto; this was the first long Italian story to be published in the newspaper. In 1949, Mario Gentilini, Topolino's director, decided to convert the newspaper into a pocket comic book containing only Disney stories. The last issue of Topolino (giornale) was #738; on April 10, 1949 the first issue of Topolino digest (libretto) format was released.Mario Morcellini, Alberto Abruzzese, Donatella Scipioni, Carocci, Il Mediaevo: TV e industria culturale nell'Italia del XX secolo Volume 290 de Universit√† (Rome, Italy), 404, 2001 Topolino libretto Topolino started as a monthly comic book, and the first issue was released on April 10, 1949: it had 100 pages and its price was 60 lire. The first issue contained the final part of Topolino e il cobra bianco, the first episode of Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse and the man of Tomorrow (the story where Eega Beeva makes its debut), a Carl Barks ten- pager where Gladstone Gander makes his second appearance (though it's the first story with the character to be published in Italy), the long story Pluto Saves the Ship, written by Barks, Jack Hannah and Nick George and drawn by an unidentified illustrator, the first episode of a long Barks story (The Old Castle's Secret, where Scrooge McDuck makes his second appearance), and many stories about minor characters like Br'er Rabbit, Li'l Bad Wolf, etc. Mickey's Inferno (L'inferno di Topolino), written by Guido Martina and drawn by Angelo Bioletto, was the second Italian story to be published on Topolino (#7-12): a satiric retelling of Dante Aligheri's Inferno, the panels of the comic also have a poem, written using hendecasyllables in terza rima, describing what's happening in each scene. Mickey's Inferno was the first Italian Great Parody and the first Disney story featuring credits, albeit partially: in the first panel, under the title of the story, it is written \\"verseggiatura di G. Martina\\", meaning \\"verses by G. Martina\\"; however, Martina was only credited for the poem and not for also writing the story, while Bioletto's work was similarly uncredited. The third Italian story to be published was Topolino e i grilli atomici (literally Mickey Mouse and the atomic crickets, #13-16), written by Martina and drawn by Bioletto: for the latter, it was his third and last Disney work. However Topolino published mainly American stories by Carl Barks, Floyd Gottfredson, Paul Murry and others and in 1951 the periodical published only American stories. In 1952, the comic book became a biweekly, and Italian stories increased. Italian stories were written mainly by Guido Martina, who wrote the first great parodies of the classics of literature: in 1956 he wrote Paperino Don Chisciotte (a parody of Don Quixote) and in 1957 he wrote Paperin di Tarascona (parody of Tartarin of Tarascon), Paperino e il conte di Montecristo (parody of The Count of Monte Cristo) and Paperino e i tre moschettieri (parody of The Three Musketeers); these stories were drawn by skillful artists such as Pier Lorenzo De Vita and Luciano Bottaro. These parodies were successful among the readers, so many other writers such as Carlo Chendi, Dalmasso, Missaglia and Romano Scarpa began to write parodies. The duo Chendi (writer)-Bottaro (artist) wrote many great parodies such as Dr. Paperus (parody of Dr. Faustus), Paperino il paladino, Paperin Furioso (parody of Orlando Furioso by Ariosto), and Paperino e il tesoro di Papero Magno. One of these parodies, Paperin Meschino (Martina/De Vita, 1958), revealed why Donald is persecuted by bad luck (Paperin meschino, one of his ancestors (he lived in the 15th century), was cursed by a witch: \\"You and all your descendents will be persecuted by bad luck for 1000 years!\\"). Romano Scarpa wrote and drew many masterpieces such as Paperino e i gamberi in salm√¨, Topolino e l'unghia di Kali (English: \\"Kali's Nail\\"), Topolino e la dimensione delta (\\"Mickey Mouse in the Delta Dimension\\"), Topolino e la collana chirikawa, Topolino imperatore della calidornia, Paperino e le lenticchie di Babilonia (\\"The Lentils from Babylon\\"), Paperin Hood. He also created many new characters such as Atomo Bleep-Bleep (Atomino Bip Bip), Trudy Van Tubb (Peg Leg Pete's girlfriend), and Brigitta MacBridge, a female duck enamoured of Scrooge (though the feelings are unrequited). Rodolfo Cimino was initially Scarpa's inker; later he became a skillful writer. He wrote many stories about Scrooge's treasure hunts. He also created Reginella, an alien female duck enamoured of Donald Duck; unfortunately their love is impossible. In 1960, Topolino became a weekly. In 1969, Guido Martina created Paperinik (Duck Avenger), the superheroic alter ego of Donald Duck. Inspired by the then- popular fictional character Diabolik as well as Fant√¥mas, Paperinik was originally the diabolic avenger of Donald Duck, and he originally committed criminal acts, i.e., stealing Uncle Scrooge's money, in order to avenge Donald (Scrooge said to Donald \\"you aren't able to steal not even a nut from a squirrel\\"). As this was not considered a good role model for Topolino's young readers, he soon became a superhero, especially reminiscent of Batman. Giorgio Pezzin was another skillful Italian writer. He wrote many sagas, i.e. I signori della galassia (The Lords of Galaxy, a sort of parody of Star Wars), C'era una volta in America (Once Upon a time in America, a far west saga that tells the story of the United States through the lives of Mickey's ancestors) and The Time machine saga. In the time machine saga Mickey Mouse and Goofy are sent back in time through a time machine by Professor Zapotec and Professor Marlin of Mouseton's museum in order to resolve the great mysteries of history (i.e. \\"Why did Napoleon always put his hand in his pocket?\\"). Massimo De Vita was the son of Pier Lorenzo De Vita. He drew many stories. He wrote also some stories, such as the Ice Sword Saga starring Mickey and Goofy in a fantasy word threatened by the \\"Lord of the Mists\\". Another skillful artist was Giovan Battista Carpi, who drew masterpieces such as Paperino missione Bob Fingher (Donald Duck mission Moldfinger) and Paperinik il diabolico vendicatore. He also wrote and drew some stories, such as the great parodies Guerra e pace (War and Peace) and Zio Paperone e il mistero dei Candelabri (parody of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo). Casty is another skillful writer and artist. Some of his stories featuring Mickey Mouse have been published in the United States in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories and in Mickey Mouse.

Early life and career Nicols was born in Edinburgh as Margaret Nicholson. Her father was from the Isle of Lewis, and her mother was half-French, half-Berber, from North Africa. In her mid-teens she left school and started to work as a dancer at the Windmill Theatre. Her first singing engagement was in a strip club in Manchester in 1965. At about that time she became obsessed with jazz, and sang with bebop pianist Dennis Rose. From then on she sang in pubs, clubs, hotels, and in dance bands with some of the finest jazz musicians around. In the midst of all this she worked abroad for a year as a dancer (including a six-month stint at the Moulin Rouge in Paris). In 1968, she went to London and joined (as Maggie Nichols) an early improvisational group, the Spontaneous Music Ensemble, with John Stevens, Trevor Watts, and Johnny Dyani, and the group performed that year at Berlin's then new avant-garde festival, Total Music Meeting. In the early 1970s she began running voice workshops at the Oval House Theatre, using free improvisational techniques that Stevens had introduced her to. She both acted in some of the productions and rehearsed regularly with a local rock band. Shortly afterwards she became part of Keith Tippett's fifty-piece British jazz/progressive rock big band Centipede, which included Julie Tippetts, Phil Minton, Robert Wyatt, Dudu Pukwana, and Alan Skidmore. She formed her own group Okuren, and later joined Tippetts, Minton, and Brian Eley to form the vocal group Voice. Around the same time she began collaborating with the Scottish percussionist Ken Hyder (who had recently moved to London) and his band Talisker. In 1978 Nicols recorded an album with the vocalist Julie Tippetts called Sweet and S'Ours on the FMP label. By the late 1970s, Nicols had become an active feminist, and co-founded the Feminist Improvising Group, which performed across Europe, with Lindsay Cooper. She also organised Contradictions, a women's workshop performance group that began in 1980 and dealt with improvisation and other modes of performance in a variety of media including music and dance. Over the years, Nicols has collaborated with other women's groups, such as the Changing Women Theatre Group, and wrote music for a prime-time television series, Women in Sport. She also composed the music for a production by Common Stock Youth Theatre of Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Later career Nicols has also collaborated regularly over the years with Swiss pianist Irene Schweizer and French bassist Joelle Leandre, including tours and three recordings as the trio \\"Les Diaboliques\\". In 1991 she began a weekly free improvisational meeting in London, which became known as The Gathering, a taste of which was captured on the album The Gathering: For John Stevens.

'(St.) Basil-pie' or 'princess pie', see below) is a New Year's Day bread or cake in Greece and many other areas in eastern Europe and the Balkans which contains a hidden coin or trinket which gives good luck to the receiver, like the Western European. It is associated with Saint Basil's day, January 1, in most of Greece, but in some regions, the traditions surrounding a cake with a hidden coin are attached to Epiphany or to Christmas. It is made of a variety of dough, depending on regional and family tradition, including tsoureki. In some families, instead of dough, it is made from a custard base called galatopita (literally milk-pita). The pie is also known as Chron√≥pita (ŒßœÅŒøŒΩœåœÄŒπœÑŒ± < œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ: chr√≥nos ‚á® time/year + œÄŒØœÑŒ±: p√≠ta ‚á® pie), meaning \\"New Year's pie\\". In other areas of the Balkans, the tradition of cake with a hidden coin during winter holidays exists, but is not associated with Saint Basil at all. The practice is documented among Ukrainians (a pirog is cut); Romanians; Serbs (\\"ƒçesnica\\", eaten on Christmas); Albanians (\\"pitta\\", eaten by both Christians and Muslims); Bulgarians (pogacha, Novogodishna banitsa (for New Year's), Svety Vasileva pogacha); etc. Ritual On New Year's Day families cut the vasilopita to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. This is usually done at the midnight of New Year's Eve. A coin is hidden in the bread by slipping it into the dough before baking. At midnight the sign of the cross is etched with a knife across the cake. A piece of cake is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, by order of age from eldest to youngest. Slices are also cut for various symbolic people or groups, depending on local and family tradition. They may include the Lord, St. Basil and other saints, the poor, the household, or the Kallikantzaroi. In older times, the coin often was a valuable one, such as a gold sovereign. Nowadays there is often a prearranged gift, money, or otherwise, to be given to the coin recipient. Many private or public institutions, such as societies, clubs, workplaces, companies, etc., cut their vasilopita at a convenient time between New Year's Day and the beginning of the Great Lent, in celebrations that range from impromptu potluck gatherings to formal receptions or balls. Saint Basil's Feast Day is observed on January 1, the beginning of the New Year and the Epiphany season known as the Vasilopita Observance. Origins Hasluck (1927) connects both the western and the eastern celebrations to the ancient Greek Kronia, the festival of Cronus, which involved selecting a \\"king\\" by lot, and then the Roman Saturnalia.Margaret Hasluck, \\"The Basil-Cake of the Greek New Year\\", Folklore 38:2:143 (June 30, 1927) The traditions surrounding vasilopita are very similar to western European celebrations of the Twelfth Night and Epiphany: the king cake of France and Louisiana and the tortell in Catalonia. Nonetheless, in popular tradition, vasilopita is associated with a legend of Basil of Caesarea. According to one story, Basil called on the Roman citizens of Caesarea to raise a ransom payment to stop the siege of the city. Each member of the city gave whatever they had in gold and jewelry. When the ransom was raised, the enemy was so embarrassed by the act of collective giving that he called off the siege without collecting payment. Basil was then tasked with returning the unpaid ransom, but had no way to know which items belonged to which family so he baked all of the jewellery into loaves of bread and distributed the loaves to the city, and by a miracle each citizen received their exact share. In some tellings, the sieging tribal chief is replaced with an evil emperor levying a tax or simply with Basil attempting to give charity to the poor without embarrassing them.Vasilopita.com, https://vasilopita.com/story/Antiochian.org, \\"The Tradition of the Vasilopita (with Recipe)\\", https://www.antiochian.org/node/18684 Bulgaria In Bulgarian cuisine, pita or pitka () is served on special occasions. It is a round bread loaf, which can sometimes be flavoured. Its preparation and consumption can have a ritual meaning. For example, on the night before Christmas Eve, ( - Badni vecher) each housewife prepares a pita and decorates it with symbols to bring fertility to the cattle and a rich harvest from the fields, as well as prosperity to each member of the household. She hides a coin in it. Whoever finds the coin will be the healthiest and the wealthiest of the family. Prior to marriage, a bride's future mother-in-law prepares a pita for the newlyweds and sifts the flour seven times, so that the pita will be soft as their future life together. Pita is also prepared for guests. A traditional welcome in Bulgaria includes pita and honey or salt. The meaning of this ritual can be found in the expression \\"to welcome someone with bread and salt\\" (since bread is an important part of Bulgarian cuisine - and as a Bulgarian proverb says, \\"no one is bigger than bread\\", and the salt is the basic ingredient that gives flavour to every meal). Name The name \\"Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªœåœÄŒπœÑŒ±\\" comes from Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœçœÇ 'king' + œÄŒØœÑŒ± 'cake', but was reinterpreted as \\"Basil's (ŒíŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ) cake\\".Babiniotis, ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒùŒ≠Œ±œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒìŒªœéœÉœÉŒ±œÇ.

A protein domain is a conserved part of a given protein sequence and tertiary structure that can evolve, function, and exist independently of the rest of the protein chain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and often can be independently stable and folded. Many proteins consist of several structural domains. One domain may appear in a variety of different proteins. Molecular evolution uses domains as building blocks and these may be recombined in different arrangements to create proteins with different functions. In general, domains vary in length from between about 50 amino acids up to 250 amino acids in length. The shortest domains, such as zinc fingers, are stabilized by metal ions or disulfide bridges. Domains often form functional units, such as the calcium-binding EF hand domain of calmodulin. Because they are independently stable, domains can be \\"swapped\\" by genetic engineering between one protein and another to make chimeric proteins. Background The concept of the domain was first proposed in 1973 by Wetlaufer after X-ray crystallographic studies of hen lysozyme and papain and by limited proteolysis studies of immunoglobulins. Wetlaufer defined domains as stable units of protein structure that could fold autonomously. In the past domains have been described as units of: * compact structure * function and evolution * folding. Each definition is valid and will often overlap, i.e. a compact structural domain that is found amongst diverse proteins is likely to fold independently within its structural environment. Nature often brings several domains together to form multidomain and multifunctional proteins with a vast number of possibilities. In a multidomain protein, each domain may fulfill its own function independently, or in a concerted manner with its neighbours. Domains can either serve as modules for building up large assemblies such as virus particles or muscle fibres, or can provide specific catalytic or binding sites as found in enzymes or regulatory proteins.  Example: Pyruvate kinase  An appropriate example is pyruvate kinase (see first figure), a glycolytic enzyme that plays an important role in regulating the flux from fructose-1,6-biphosphate to pyruvate. It contains an all-Œ≤ nucleotide binding domain (in blue), an Œ±/Œ≤-substrate binding domain (in grey) and an Œ±/Œ≤-regulatory domain (in olive green), connected by several polypeptide linkers. Each domain in this protein occurs in diverse sets of protein families. The central Œ±/Œ≤-barrel substrate binding domain is one of the most common enzyme folds. It is seen in many different enzyme families catalysing completely unrelated reactions. The Œ±/Œ≤-barrel is commonly called the TIM barrel named after triose phosphate isomerase, which was the first such structure to be solved. It is currently classified into 26 homologous families in the CATH domain database. The TIM barrel is formed from a sequence of Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤ motifs closed by the first and last strand hydrogen bonding together, forming an eight stranded barrel. There is debate about the evolutionary origin of this domain. One study has suggested that a single ancestral enzyme could have diverged into several families, while another suggests that a stable TIM- barrel structure has evolved through convergent evolution. The TIM-barrel in pyruvate kinase is 'discontinuous', meaning that more than one segment of the polypeptide is required to form the domain. This is likely to be the result of the insertion of one domain into another during the protein's evolution. It has been shown from known structures that about a quarter of structural domains are discontinuous. The inserted Œ≤-barrel regulatory domain is 'continuous', made up of a single stretch of polypeptide. Units of protein structure The primary structure (string of amino acids) of a protein ultimately encodes its uniquely folded three-dimensional (3D) conformation. The most important factor governing the folding of a protein into 3D structure is the distribution of polar and non-polar side chains. Folding is driven by the burial of hydrophobic side chains into the interior of the molecule so to avoid contact with the aqueous environment. Generally proteins have a core of hydrophobic residues surrounded by a shell of hydrophilic residues. Since the peptide bonds themselves are polar they are neutralised by hydrogen bonding with each other when in the hydrophobic environment. This gives rise to regions of the polypeptide that form regular 3D structural patterns called secondary structure. There are two main types of secondary structure: Œ±-helices and Œ≤-sheets. Some simple combinations of secondary structure elements have been found to frequently occur in protein structure and are referred to as supersecondary structure or motifs. For example, the Œ≤-hairpin motif consists of two adjacent antiparallel Œ≤-strands joined by a small loop. It is present in most antiparallel Œ≤ structures both as an isolated ribbon and as part of more complex Œ≤-sheets. Another common super-secondary structure is the Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤ motif, which is frequently used to connect two parallel Œ≤-strands. The central Œ±-helix connects the C-termini of the first strand to the N-termini of the second strand, packing its side chains against the Œ≤-sheet and therefore shielding the hydrophobic residues of the Œ≤-strands from the surface. Covalent association of two domains represents a functional and structural advantage since there is an increase in stability when compared with the same structures non-covalently associated. Other, advantages are the protection of intermediates within inter-domain enzymatic clefts that may otherwise be unstable in aqueous environments, and a fixed stoichiometric ratio of the enzymatic activity necessary for a sequential set of reactions. Structural alignment is an important tool for determining domains. Tertiary structure Several motifs pack together to form compact, local, semi- independent units called domains. The overall 3D structure of the polypeptide chain is referred to as the protein's tertiary structure. Domains are the fundamental units of tertiary structure, each domain containing an individual hydrophobic core built from secondary structural units connected by loop regions. The packing of the polypeptide is usually much tighter in the interior than the exterior of the domain producing a solid-like core and a fluid-like surface. Core residues are often conserved in a protein family, whereas the residues in loops are less conserved, unless they are involved in the protein's function. Protein tertiary structure can be divided into four main classes based on the secondary structural content of the domain. * All-Œ± domains have a domain core built exclusively from Œ±-helices. This class is dominated by small folds, many of which form a simple bundle with helices running up and down. * All-Œ≤ domains have a core composed of antiparallel Œ≤-sheets, usually two sheets packed against each other. Various patterns can be identified in the arrangement of the strands, often giving rise to the identification of recurring motifs, for example the Greek key motif. * Œ±+Œ≤ domains are a mixture of all-Œ± and all-Œ≤ motifs. Classification of proteins into this class is difficult because of overlaps to the other three classes and therefore is not used in the CATH domain database. * Œ±/Œ≤ domains are made from a combination of Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤ motifs that predominantly form a parallel Œ≤-sheet surrounded by amphipathic Œ±-helices. The secondary structures are arranged in layers or barrels. Limits on size Domains have limits on size. The size of individual structural domains varies from 36 residues in E-selectin to 692 residues in lipoxygenase-1, but the majority, 90%, have fewer than 200 residues with an average of approximately 100 residues. Very short domains, less than 40 residues, are often stabilised by metal ions or disulfide bonds. Larger domains, greater than 300 residues, are likely to consist of multiple hydrophobic cores. Quaternary structure Many proteins have a quaternary structure, which consists of several polypeptide chains that associate into an oligomeric molecule. Each polypeptide chain in such a protein is called a subunit. Hemoglobin, for example, consists of two Œ± and two Œ≤ subunits. Each of the four chains has an all-Œ± globin fold with a heme pocket. Domain swapping is a mechanism for forming oligomeric assemblies. In domain swapping, a secondary or tertiary element of a monomeric protein is replaced by the same element of another protein. Domain swapping can range from secondary structure elements to whole structural domains. It also represents a model of evolution for functional adaptation by oligomerisation, e.g. oligomeric enzymes that have their active site at subunit interfaces. Domains as evolutionary modules Nature is a tinkerer and not an inventor, new sequences are adapted from pre-existing sequences rather than invented. Domains are the common material used by nature to generate new sequences; they can be thought of as genetically mobile units, referred to as 'modules'. Often, the C and N termini of domains are close together in space, allowing them to easily be \\"slotted into\\" parent structures during the process of evolution. Many domain families are found in all three forms of life, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. Protein modules are a subset of protein domains which are found across a range of different proteins with a particularly versatile structure. Examples can be found among extracellular proteins associated with clotting, fibrinolysis, complement, the extracellular matrix, cell surface adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors. Four concrete examples of widespread protein modules are the following domains: SH2, immunoglobulin, fibronectin type 3 and the kringle. Molecular evolution gives rise to families of related proteins with similar sequence and structure. However, sequence similarities can be extremely low between proteins that share the same structure. Protein structures may be similar because proteins have diverged from a common ancestor. Alternatively, some folds may be more favored than others as they represent stable arrangements of secondary structures and some proteins may converge towards these folds over the course of evolution. There are currently about 110,000 experimentally determined protein 3D structures deposited within the Protein Data Bank (PDB). However, this set contains many identical or very similar structures. All proteins should be classified to structural families to understand their evolutionary relationships. Structural comparisons are best achieved at the domain level. For this reason many algorithms have been developed to automatically assign domains in proteins with known 3D structure; see 'Domain definition from structural co-ordinates'. The CATH domain database classifies domains into approximately 800 fold families; ten of these folds are highly populated and are referred to as 'super-folds'. Super-folds are defined as folds for which there are at least three structures without significant sequence similarity. The most populated is the Œ±/Œ≤-barrel super- fold, as described previously.  Multidomain proteins  The majority of proteins, two-thirds in unicellular organisms and more than 80% in metazoa, are multidomain proteins. However, other studies concluded that 40% of prokaryotic proteins consist of multiple domains while eukaryotes have approximately 65% multi-domain proteins. Many domains in eukaryotic multidomain proteins can be found as independent proteins in prokaryotes, suggesting that domains in multidomain proteins have once existed as independent proteins. For example, vertebrates have a multi-enzyme polypeptide containing the GAR synthetase, AIR synthetase and GAR transformylase domains (GARs-AIRs-GARt; GAR: glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase/transferase; AIR: aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase). In insects, the polypeptide appears as GARs-(AIRs)2-GARt, in yeast GARs-AIRs is encoded separately from GARt, and in bacteria each domain is encoded separately. Origin Multidomain proteins are likely to have emerged from selective pressure during evolution to create new functions. Various proteins have diverged from common ancestors by different combinations and associations of domains. Modular units frequently move about, within and between biological systems through mechanisms of genetic shuffling: * transposition of mobile elements including horizontal transfers (between species); * gross rearrangements such as inversions, translocations, deletions and duplications; * homologous recombination; * slippage of DNA polymerase during replication. Types of organization PH domain modules (maroon) into two different proteins. The simplest multidomain organization seen in proteins is that of a single domain repeated in tandem. The domains may interact with each other (domain-domain interaction) or remain isolated, like beads on string. The giant 30,000 residue muscle protein titin comprises about 120 fibronectin-III-type and Ig- type domains. In the serine proteases, a gene duplication event has led to the formation of a two Œ≤-barrel domain enzyme. The repeats have diverged so widely that there is no obvious sequence similarity between them. The active site is located at a cleft between the two Œ≤-barrel domains, in which functionally important residues are contributed from each domain. Genetically engineered mutants of the chymotrypsin serine protease were shown to have some proteinase activity even though their active site residues were abolished and it has therefore been postulated that the duplication event enhanced the enzyme's activity. Modules frequently display different connectivity relationships, as illustrated by the kinesins and ABC transporters. The kinesin motor domain can be at either end of a polypeptide chain that includes a coiled-coil region and a cargo domain. ABC transporters are built with up to four domains consisting of two unrelated modules, ATP-binding cassette and an integral membrane module, arranged in various combinations. Not only do domains recombine, but there are many examples of a domain having been inserted into another. Sequence or structural similarities to other domains demonstrate that homologues of inserted and parent domains can exist independently. An example is that of the 'fingers' inserted into the 'palm' domain within the polymerases of the Pol I family. Since a domain can be inserted into another, there should always be at least one continuous domain in a multidomain protein. This is the main difference between definitions of structural domains and evolutionary/functional domains. An evolutionary domain will be limited to one or two connections between domains, whereas structural domains can have unlimited connections, within a given criterion of the existence of a common core. Several structural domains could be assigned to an evolutionary domain. A superdomain consists of two or more conserved domains of nominally independent origin, but subsequently inherited as a single structural/functional unit. This combined superdomain can occur in diverse proteins that are not related by gene duplication alone. An example of a superdomain is the protein tyrosine phosphatase‚ÄìC2 domain pair in PTEN, tensin, auxilin and the membrane protein TPTE2. This superdomain is found in proteins in animals, plants and fungi. A key feature of the PTP-C2 superdomain is amino acid residue conservation in the domain interface.  Domains are autonomous folding units = Folding  Protein folding - the unsolved problem : Since the seminal work of Anfinsen in the early 1960s, the goal to completely understand the mechanism by which a polypeptide rapidly folds into its stable native conformation remains elusive. Many experimental folding studies have contributed much to our understanding, but the principles that govern protein folding are still based on those discovered in the very first studies of folding. Anfinsen showed that the native state of a protein is thermodynamically stable, the conformation being at a global minimum of its free energy. Folding is a directed search of conformational space allowing the protein to fold on a biologically feasible time scale. The Levinthal paradox states that if an averaged sized protein would sample all possible conformations before finding the one with the lowest energy, the whole process would take billions of years. Proteins typically fold within 0.1 and 1000 seconds. Therefore, the protein folding process must be directed some way through a specific folding pathway. The forces that direct this search are likely to be a combination of local and global influences whose effects are felt at various stages of the reaction. Advances in experimental and theoretical studies have shown that folding can be viewed in terms of energy landscapes, where folding kinetics is considered as a progressive organisation of an ensemble of partially folded structures through which a protein passes on its way to the folded structure. This has been described in terms of a folding funnel, in which an unfolded protein has a large number of conformational states available and there are fewer states available to the folded protein. A funnel implies that for protein folding there is a decrease in energy and loss of entropy with increasing tertiary structure formation. The local roughness of the funnel reflects kinetic traps, corresponding to the accumulation of misfolded intermediates. A folding chain progresses toward lower intra-chain free-energies by increasing its compactness. The chain's conformational options become increasingly narrowed ultimately toward one native structure. Advantage of domains in protein folding The organisation of large proteins by structural domains represents an advantage for protein folding, with each domain being able to individually fold, accelerating the folding process and reducing a potentially large combination of residue interactions. Furthermore, given the observed random distribution of hydrophobic residues in proteins, domain formation appears to be the optimal solution for a large protein to bury its hydrophobic residues while keeping the hydrophilic residues at the surface. However, the role of inter- domain interactions in protein folding and in energetics of stabilisation of the native structure, probably differs for each protein. In T4 lysozyme, the influence of one domain on the other is so strong that the entire molecule is resistant to proteolytic cleavage. In this case, folding is a sequential process where the C-terminal domain is required to fold independently in an early step, and the other domain requires the presence of the folded C-terminal domain for folding and stabilisation. It has been found that the folding of an isolated domain can take place at the same rate or sometimes faster than that of the integrated domain, suggesting that unfavourable interactions with the rest of the protein can occur during folding. Several arguments suggest that the slowest step in the folding of large proteins is the pairing of the folded domains. This is either because the domains are not folded entirely correctly or because the small adjustments required for their interaction are energetically unfavourable,Creighton, T. E. (1983). Proteins: Structures and molecular properties. Freeman, New York. Second edition. such as the removal of water from the domain interface.  Domains and protein flexibility  Protein domain dynamics play a key role in a multitude of molecular recognition and signaling processes. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker domains, induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics. The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains. They can however be inferred by comparing different structures of a protein (as in Database of Molecular Motions). They can also be suggested by sampling in extensive molecular dynamics trajectories and principal component analysis, or they can be directly observed using spectra measured by neutron spin echo spectroscopy.  Domain definition from structural co-ordinates  The importance of domains as structural building blocks and elements of evolution has brought about many automated methods for their identification and classification in proteins of known structure. Automatic procedures for reliable domain assignment is essential for the generation of the domain databases, especially as the number of known protein structures is increasing. Although the boundaries of a domain can be determined by visual inspection, construction of an automated method is not straightforward. Problems occur when faced with domains that are discontinuous or highly associated. The fact that there is no standard definition of what a domain really is has meant that domain assignments have varied enormously, with each researcher using a unique set of criteria. A structural domain is a compact, globular sub-structure with more interactions within it than with the rest of the protein. Therefore, a structural domain can be determined by two visual characteristics: its compactness and its extent of isolation. Measures of local compactness in proteins have been used in many of the early methods of domain assignment and in several of the more recent methods. Methods One of the first algorithms used a CŒ±-CŒ± distance map together with a hierarchical clustering routine that considered proteins as several small segments, 10 residues in length. The initial segments were clustered one after another based on inter- segment distances; segments with the shortest distances were clustered and considered as single segments thereafter. The stepwise clustering finally included the full protein. Go also exploited the fact that inter-domain distances are normally larger than intra-domain distances; all possible CŒ±-CŒ± distances were represented as diagonal plots in which there were distinct patterns for helices, extended strands and combinations of secondary structures. The method by Sowdhamini and Blundell clusters secondary structures in a protein based on their CŒ±-CŒ± distances and identifies domains from the pattern in their dendrograms. As the procedure does not consider the protein as a continuous chain of amino acids there are no problems in treating discontinuous domains. Specific nodes in these dendrograms are identified as tertiary structural clusters of the protein, these include both super- secondary structures and domains. The DOMAK algorithm is used to create the 3Dee domain database. It calculates a 'split value' from the number of each type of contact when the protein is divided arbitrarily into two parts. This split value is large when the two parts of the structure are distinct. The method of Wodak and Janin was based on the calculated interface areas between two chain segments repeatedly cleaved at various residue positions. Interface areas were calculated by comparing surface areas of the cleaved segments with that of the native structure. Potential domain boundaries can be identified at a site where the interface area was at a minimum. Other methods have used measures of solvent accessibility to calculate compactness.Rashin, 1985 The PUU algorithm incorporates a harmonic model used to approximate inter-domain dynamics. The underlying physical concept is that many rigid interactions will occur within each domain and loose interactions will occur between domains. This algorithm is used to define domains in the FSSP domain database. Swindells (1995) developed a method, DETECTIVE, for identification of domains in protein structures based on the idea that domains have a hydrophobic interior. Deficiencies were found to occur when hydrophobic cores from different domains continue through the interface region. RigidFinder is a novel method for identification of protein rigid blocks (domains and loops) from two different conformations. Rigid blocks are defined as blocks where all inter residue distances are conserved across conformations. The method RIBFIND developed by Pandurangan and Topf identifies rigid bodies in protein structures by performing spacial clustering of secondary structural elements in proteins. The RIBFIND rigid bodies have been used to flexibly fit protein structures into cryo electron microscopy density maps. A general method to identify dynamical domains, that is protein regions that behave approximately as rigid units in the course of structural fluctuations, has been introduced by Potestio et al. and, among other applications was also used to compare the consistency of the dynamics-based domain subdivisions with standard structure- based ones. The method, termed PiSQRD, is publicly available in the form of a webserver. The latter allows users to optimally subdivide single-chain or multimeric proteins into quasi-rigid domains based on the collective modes of fluctuation of the system. By default the latter are calculated through an elastic network model;Micheletti, C., Carloni, P. and Maritan, A. Accurate and efficient description of protein vibrational dynamics: comparing molecular dynamics and gaussian models, Proteins, 55, 635, 2004. alternatively pre- calculated essential dynamical spaces can be uploaded by the user.  Example domains  *Armadillo repeats : named after the Œ≤-catenin-like Armadillo protein of the fruit fly Drosophila. *Basic Leucine zipper domain (bZIP domain) : is found in many DNA-binding eukaryotic proteins. One part of the domain contains a region that mediates sequence-specific DNA-binding properties and the Leucine zipper that is required for the dimerization of two DNA-binding regions. The DNA-binding region comprises a number of basic aminoacids such as arginine and lysine *Cadherin repeats : Cadherins function as Ca2+-dependent cell‚Äìcell adhesion proteins. Cadherin domains are extracellular regions which mediate cell-to-cell homophilic binding between cadherins on the surface of adjacent cells. *Death effector domain (DED) : allows protein‚Äìprotein binding by homotypic interactions (DED-DED). Caspase proteases trigger apoptosis via proteolytic cascades. Pro-Caspase-8 and pro- caspase-9 bind to specific adaptor molecules via DED domains and this leads to autoactivation of caspases. *EF hand : a helix-turn-helix structural motif found in each structural domain of the signaling protein calmodulin and in the muscle protein troponin-C. *Immunoglobulin-like domains : are found in proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). They contain about 70-110 amino acids and are classified into different categories (IgV, IgC1, IgC2 and IgI) according to their size and function. They possess a characteristic fold in which two beta sheets form a \\"sandwich\\" that is stabilized by interactions between conserved cysteines and other charged amino acids. They are important for protein‚Äìprotein interactions in processes of cell adhesion, cell activation, and molecular recognition. These domains are commonly found in molecules with roles in the immune system. *Phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) : PTB domains usually bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues. They are often found in signal transduction proteins. PTB-domain binding specificity is determined by residues to the amino-terminal side of the phosphotyrosine. Examples: the PTB domains of both SHC and IRS-1 bind to a NPXpY sequence. PTB- containing proteins such as SHC and IRS-1 are important for insulin responses of human cells. *Pleckstrin homology domain (PH) : PH domains bind phosphoinositides with high affinity. Specificity for PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have all been observed. Given the fact that phosphoinositides are sequestered to various cell membranes (due to their long lipophilic tail) the PH domains usually causes recruitment of the protein in question to a membrane where the protein can exert a certain function in cell signalling, cytoskeletal reorganization or membrane trafficking. *Src homology 2 domain (SH2) : SH2 domains are often found in signal transduction proteins. SH2 domains confer binding to phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr). Named after the phosphotyrosine binding domain of the src viral oncogene, which is itself a tyrosine kinase. See also: SH3 domain. *Zinc finger DNA binding domain (ZnF_GATA) : ZnF_GATA domain- containing proteins are typically transcription factors that usually bind to the DNA sequence [AT]GATA[AG] of promoters.  Domains of unknown function  A large fraction of domains are of unknown function. A domain of unknown function (DUF) is a protein domain that has no characterized function. These families have been collected together in the Pfam database using the prefix DUF followed by a number, with examples being DUF2992 and DUF1220. There are now over 3,000 DUF families within the Pfam database representing over 20% of known families. Surprisingly, the number of DUFs in Pfam has increased from 20% (in 2010) to 22% (in 2019), mostly due to an increasing number of new genome sequences. Pfam release 32.0 (2019) contained 3,961 DUFs.

He attended Horseheads High School in Horseheads, New York before attending Florida International University and Monroe Community College. Career=The draft and minors Keagle was selected in the sixth round, 170th overall, of the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Diego Padres. He was used almost entirely as a starter in the minors, appearing in only one game in relief before his first call to the majors. His first professional season in the Northwest League with the Spokane Indians was promising (3-3 record, 3.25 ERA), but the first half of his 1994 season was absolutely outstanding. He was 11-1 with a 2.05 ERA in 14 games for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and was named to the California League All-Star team. However, that success did not continue after he was promoted to the Double-A Wichita Wranglers, where he was 3-9 with a 6.27 ERA. He remained in the Padres organization until September 17, 1995, when he was named as the player to be named later in a deal announced July 31 in which the Padres sent Andy Benes to the Seattle Mariners for Ron Villone and Marc Newfield. In December of that year, the Tigers took him from the Mariners in the Rule 5 Draft. The majors Keagle was on the Tigers' Opening Day roster in 1996, and he made his debut in their first game of the season, April 1. He pitched three innings in his first big league game, surrendering three hits, walking two and striking out two. He allowed one earned run. His first career strikeout victim was Chuck Knoblauch. He then struck out Rich Becker, who followed Knoblauch in the batting order. Keagle did not have a very successful rookie season. In 26 games (six started), he posted a three and six record with an ERA of 7.39. He also walked 68 batters in 87+ innings of work. He was used mostly as a starter in the final two seasons of his career, 1997 and 1998. He went three and eight combined in those final two years, posting a career best ERA of 5.59 in 1998. He did not average five innings a start in his final two seasons. Perhaps the best game of his career came on September 12, 1997, against the Oakland Athletics. He threw seven fine innings of work, giving up only five hits, one run (a home run to Scott Spiezio) walking only one and striking out nine batters. Overall, his career record was six and 16. He posted an ERA of 6.76, and in 171 innings of work, he walked 106 batters and struck out 123. He pitched in a total of 46 games in his career, starting exactly half of those. He hit a total of 18 batters in his career, or one every 9.53 innings of work. He had only one career at bat, facing Denny Neagle of the Atlanta Braves on September 2, 1997, he struck out. He committed zero errors in his career, for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. He played his final big league game on May 26, 1998. He wore number 57 during his time in the majors. Back to the minors Although his major league career ended in 1998, his professional career lasted until 2005. He stayed in the Tigers' organization in 1999, split time between the Anaheim Angels organization and the Elmira Pioneers in 2000, where he threw the first no-hitter in Pioneers history (and just one of three in Northeast League history). In 2001 and 2002, Keagle was a pitcher/coach for the Pioneers. He played in the Florida Marlins organization in all of 2003. He last played in 2005 with the Elmira Pioneers of the Can-Am League. Overall, he spent six professional seasons as a teammate of Raul Casanova-longer than any other teammate.

Club career Mokone attracted much attention in his native South Africa, making his debut for a South Africa Black XI at the age of just 16. The Durban Bush Bucks player was close to signing for English side Newcastle United but for the intervention of his father, who wished him to continue his studies. Mokone began his professional career in 1955 with English side Coventry City, where he made four league appearances, scoring one goal in the process. He later played in the Netherlands with Heracles Almelo, for whom he scored twice at his debut and won the 1958 Tweede Divisie title to become a club legend.Steve Mokone, de Zwarte Meteoor, overleden - Tubantia He was the first foreign professional player in Dutch football.Heracles-legende Steve Mokone overleden - Voetbal International A stand in Heracles' Polman Stadion is named after him.

According to his obituary on the Cambridge web site, he was \\"recognized as one of the leading philosophers of science and epistemologists in the world.\\" Career Lipton was an undergraduate at Wesleyan University and a graduate student at Oxford University. Before coming to Cambridge, he taught at Clark University and Williams College. He was a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and chaired the working party that produced Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues. He was also on the AskPhilosophers panel. In 2004, Lipton had the honour of being the Medawar Prize Lecturer of the Royal Society. Lipton's research interests focused on the philosophy of science, including topics such as explanation, inference, testing, theory change, laws of nature, and scientific realism. Lipton's research in philosophy of science led him to do work in other related areas of philosophy; in epistemology, Lipton also investigated the philosophy of induction and testimony. Likewise in philosophy of mind Lipton researched notions of mental content and the mind-body problem. He was a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2003‚Äì2007). Personal life Lipton lived with his wife Diana and two sons Jonah and Jacob. He was a self-confessed \\"religious atheist\\"; he held that he could follow the customs and culture of a Jewish lifestyle, and use the teachings of Judaism to help him tackle moral problems in life, without simultaneously believing in the metaphysics of such a religion (such as the existence of God). On 25 November 2007, Lipton suffered a fatal heart attack after playing a game of squash. He was succeeded in his capacity as Head of Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge by Professor John Forrester.

Seasons given are first and last seasons; the player did not necessarily play in all the intervening seasons. Note that many players represented other top- class teams besides Somerset. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.

He assisted Giambologna's foreman, Pietro Tacca, in Paris, in finishing and erecting the equestrian statue of Henri IV on the Pont Neuf. He moved to England and spent the most productive decades of his working career there, providing monuments, portraits and replicas of classical antiquities for the court of Charles I, where his main rival was Francesco Fanelli.

Webb quotes Sir Balthazar Gerbier's draft for a contract for the sculpture (p 16). was informed that Le Sueur was a pupil of Giambologna in Florence. Though he is not otherwise documented in Florence, in Paris he was recorded as sculpteur du Roy at the baptism of his son at Saint- Germain l'Auxerrois in 1610, when a royal secretary and the daughter of another served as witnesses. In London he and his second wife were of the Huguenot congregation in Threadneedle Street.Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of London, vol. vii, noted by Cust 1912: He worked with Pietro Tacca's assistantsTacca sent the bronze to Paris in 1614; it was completed in 1618. on the equestrian bronze of Henri IV on the Pont Neuf, a project that gave him technical skills that were put to use in his equestrian Charles I. Since Inigo Jones had passed through Paris in July 1613, in the train of Lord Arundel, on their way to Strasbourg, Katharine Esdaile suggestedEsdaile 1935:178. that Jones was the one who convinced Le Sueur to go to England. The earliest occasion on which Le Sueur received an official commission in England was for twelve figures against the frieze of the grand catafalque‚Äî both figures and hearse designed by Inigo Jones ‚Äî in James I's funeral, 1625.Katharine A. Esdaile, \\"New Light on Hubert Le Sueur\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 66 No. 385 (April 1935, pp 177-184) p 177. In 1631 he was dispatched to Rome to arrange to have moulds taken of classical antiquities, to complement the Borghese Gladiator, moulds of which had been obtained for Charles, and which Le Sueur cast in London for the Privy Garden of the Palace of Whitehall.Now on the East Terrace, Windsor Castle. As a great favour, the 4th Earl of Pembroke was permitted to have Le Sueur make a second cast, for the centre of his parterre garden at Wilton House. The 8th Earl of Pembroke subsequently presented it to Robert Walpole for Houghton Hall, where it now is; see Edward Chaney, The Evolution of English Collecting (New Haven and London, 2003), p. 44 and fig. 4. Henry Peacham praised Le Sueur for his skill and credits the Catholic priest and agent, George Gage, with obtaining the relevant casts in Rome: \\"The best of them is the Gladiator, molded from that in Cardinall Borgheses Villa, by the procurement and industry of ingenious Master Gage.\\" Chaney, Evolution of English Collecting, p. 43 On a recommendation of Sir Bathazar Gerbier, he cast the famous bronze equestrian statue of the king, made in 1633According to the inscription on the hoof of the horse's left foreleg. for Richard, Lord Weston, Lord High Treasurer, for his house Mortlake Park in Roehampton. This statue was ordered to be destroyed by Parliament in 1649. After being hidden by the man charged with destroying the statue, it resurfaced at the Restoration and was erected in 1675 at the original site of Charing Cross, at Trafalgar Square, London (on a small traffic island at the entrance to The Mall).Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (1983) The London Encyclopaedia: 815 In 1634 he made for the king a cast of the Diane Chasseresse then still at Fontainebleau.Now at Windsor Castle. (Haskell and Penny 1981:196). It was alluded to by Peacham, 1634 Le Sueur created a market for the portrait bust, initiated and epitomized by a series of bronze busts and one marble bust of Charles I (1631), now at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the only work in marble by Le Sueur known to exist.Sculptural enrichments on the tomb monuments are in general applied bronzes; marble sculptures in Le Sueur's tomb monuments are attributed to his assistants. A bust of Katherine, Lady Dysart, was formerly at Ham House. There are bronze sculptures by Le Sueur for tombs in Westminster Abbey, of the Stuart Kings Charles I and James I originally in niches on the former screen by Inigo Jones in Winchester Cathedral and now re-located at the west end of the Cathedral in which Le Sueur also provided the bronze reclining figure for the tomb of Lord Portland.Equally in contexts supervised by Jones, in the Banqueting House, the colossal bust of James I is by Hubert Le Sueur, and on Jones' porch for Old St Paul's, Le Sueur's sculptures were lost in the Great Fire of London (Esdaile 1935). At Oxford are his lifesize bronze standing figures of King Charles and Queen Henrietta Maria, made for Archbishop Laud, 1634, now at St John's College,Geoffrey Webb, \\"Notes on Hubert le Sueur-II\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 52 No. 299 (February 1928, pp. 81-89) p 82. and of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), originally standing in the forecourt at Wilton House and in 1723 donated by the 8th Earl to the Bodleian Library,The donor, the 8th Earl, recorded in 1723 on an inscription on the plinth that it follows a drawing by Rubens (Webb 1928:16). Oxford, where it now stands outdoors in front of the main entrance. With the beginnings of the English Civil War, English court patronage dried up, and Le Sueur returned to Paris in 1643, produced four busts of Richelieu for the duchesse d'Aiguillon, and disappeared from art history. His known pupils were both of Huguenot extraction as was Le Sueur himself: one was Peter Besnier (or Bennier), appointed sculptor to the king after Le Sueur's departure; another was John Poultrain or Colt.Esdaile 1935.

History The station signed on in 1999 as KWOL, although while it was still unbuilt, the Federal Communications Commission construction permit used the call sign KVPC. The station played smooth jazz music from 2006 to 2009 as KJZN. This was the second station in Fresno to use the smooth jazz format, which was previously heard on 96.7 KEZL (now KALZ). On April 29, 2009, KJWL began stunting with Christmas music interspersed with Santa Claus-voiced liners which invited listeners to tune in on Friday, May 1, at noon if they \\"can handle the truth.\\" At noon on May 1, the station flipped to a conservative talk format called \\"105.5 The Truth.\\" The conservative talk format lasted three and a half years. On January 28, 2013, KJZN changed its format from talk to sports radio, branded as \\"105.5 The Game,\\" with programming from the CBS Sports Radio Network. On Tuesday, November 25, 2014, KJZN and sister stations 104.1 KFRR and 95.7 KJFX were purchased by One Putt Broadcasting from Wilks Broadcasting for $6.6 million. The purchase was consummated on January 30, 2015. On March 5, 2015, at 6 AM, KJZN flipped to classic hip-hop. Initially set to be branded as \\"Bling 105.5,\\" One Putt decided that 105.5's branding under its new format was to be chosen via an online name-the-station contest. In mid-May, the contest ended, and 105.5's new branding was revealed as \\"Rewind 105.5\\". On January 1, 2017, KJZN dropped the classic hip-hop format and adopted the branding and call sign, used on \\"K-Jewel,\\" previously heard on FM 99.3 (now KWDO). The format was Soft Adult Contemporary.99.3 Now FM Fresno Launches as Jewel FM Moves Radioinsight - January 2, 2017 On January 5, 2017, KJZN changed its call sign to KJWL.

Michel Warschawski (Mikado) () is an Israeli anti-Zionist activist. He led the Marxist Revolutionary Communist League (previously Matzpen-Jerusalem) until its demise in the 1990s, and founded the Alternative Information Center, a joint Palestinian-Israeli non-governmental organization, in 1984.  Biography  Michel Warschawski, July 2005. Michel Warschawski was born 1949 in Strasbourg, France, where his father was the Rabbi. At the age of 16 Warschawski moved to Jerusalem, in order to study the Talmud‚Äîhe is a graduate of Mercaz HaRav. He later studied philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Despite having long since stopped being religious, fellow-activists on occasion turn to him to elucidate subtle points of the Jewish religion. In 1982, Warschawski was one of the co-founders of Yesh Gvul, a term that plays on three meanings: (1) \\"there is a border\\": \\"there is a limit\\": and \\"enough's enough\\".Daphne Golan, \\"Between Universalism and Particularism: the 'Border' in Israeli Discourse\\", in V.

In 1987, Warschawski was arrested for \\"providing services for illegal (Palestinian) organizations\\" and sentenced in 1989 to twenty months in prison, with a 10-month suspended sentence, for typesetting a booklet that the judges ruled had come from members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which described torture and interrogation techniques allegedly employed by Israel's security apparatus, with advice on how to withstand them. The court determined that Warschawsky was unaware of the booklet's origins, but guilty of closing his eyes to the evidence.Daphne Golan, 1997, p. 89. Warschawski is a writer and journalist, whose articles appear regularly in International Viewpoint, Le Monde diplomatique, ZNet, Monthly Review, Sin√© Hebdo and other publications.

The awards are Australia's only national design awards for industrial design. Since 1991, the Australian International Design Awards has been a division of Standards Australia. In 2007 the Australian Design Awards expanded its entry criteria to include all professionally designed products on the Australian market, including products designed in Australia. From 2007, the Australian Design Awards became known as the Australian International Design Awards to reflect the global nature of the awards. The Australian International Design Awards has been recognised by the Commonwealth Government and the International Council of Societies of Industrial DesignICSID .org as a promotional body for the Australian design industry.  Awards  There are three types of accolades issued by the Australian International Design Awards,Designawards.com.au they are: * Australian International Design Mark (recognising Good Design) * Australian International Design Award (recognising Design Excellence) * Australian International Design Award of the Year (recognising the best product of the year) Special Awards include: * Award for Excellence in Sustainable DesignSustainable design * Powerhouse Museum Design Award and SelectionPowerhouse museum selection * Wheels Automotive Design AwardWheels  History  In 1958 the Industrial Design Council of Australia (IDCA) was established funded by the Commonwealth Government. The goal was to educate manufacturers and consumers on the value of design, encourage and promote high standards of design in manufactured goods. From 1964 Good Design Labels began to appear on products and the Australian Design Index became a register of the best designed products in Australia. A panel of experts reviewed items for inclusion in the Index. Products meeting the criteria received the Good Design Label and other manufacturers were given constructive criticism on how to improve their products. In 1964, the IDCA opened the first Australian Design Centre in Melbourne with a special exhibition of selected products from the Australian Design Index. Federal and state government funding helped establish a new Design Centre in Sydney, with more centres to follow in other cities. In 1967 the Prince Philip Prize for Australian Design was set up, supported by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with the aim of promoting greater awareness of good design in Australian engineering. The inaugural Prince Philip Prize was awarded in 1968. Over 90 entries were received and the winning entry was a self-propelled grain header, designed by Kenneth Gibson. The Prince Philip Prize continued for twenty years. The IDCA faced funding difficulties in the mid-1970s and was forced to close temporarily in 1976. A new funding injection from the Commonwealth Government helped the Council reopen and a new 'innovation' recognition program was introduced. Recognising not only high quality but innovative Australian designed products, the Australian Design Award (ADA) program became a valuable promotional tool for manufacturers and designers and provided a source of revenue for the IDCA to continue its operations. The Prince Philip Prize continued to be awarded, but only to products which had received the ADA. During this time, publicity was at an all-time high. Televised coverage of the Awards presentation on ABC TV reached audiences of over four million and in 1979, the first annual yearbook of ADA winners was published. For the next two decades, however, continuing funding issues, dwindling industry support and a lack of clear direction plagued the IDCA. In 1987 in an effort to reinvigorate the movement, the government re-launched the IDCA as the Australian Design Council and the Prince Philip Prize was folded, leaving the ADA as Australia's top design accolade. In 1991, control of the Australian Design Council and the ADA program moved to Standards Australia. Under Standards Australia, the ADA program continued to run, but the Australian Design Council was disbanded in 1993. New formats and incentives for the ADA program such as the Australian Design Mark certification scheme were trialled during the second half of the '90s without success. In 1997 a revamped format was introduced to the Awards, using an online application form and first round internet shortlisting. It attracted more than one hundred applications. The first Presentation Night was held at the Metro Theatre in Sydney. In 1998, profession-based categories were introduced. However, the program was threatened by significant operating costs. The 1999 program was put on hold while Standards Australia explored other options to secure the future of the awards. The majority of staff was made redundant and for the first time in many years, no Design Awards were presented in Australia. The Design Institute of Australia was approached to take over the program but the financial commitment to posed too great a risk. Armed with a new business plan and financial model, the Board of Standards Australia approved another year for the awards. For the next few years, the ADA continued to grow in standing and support, buoyed by financial stability. A student design category was launched in 2002 supported by Dyson Appliances Australia and in 2004, product-focused categories were introduced. In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of rewarding design and innovation excellence in Australia, internationally designed products available for sale in Australia were allowed to enter the awards for the first time. This bold move was aimed at raising the stakes for good design once again, allowing Australian design to be benchmarked against the best in the world. With the ongoing support of the design industry and Standards Australia, this opens the door to the next chapter in the history of the Design Awards.50 Year Retrospective of the Australian International Design Awards 1958‚Äì2008  Previous winners  Previous winners include: * Caroma's Invisi Series II Toilet Suite and H2Zero Cube Urinal * Qantas A380 Economy Class Seat2009 Australian International Design Award of the Year designed by Marc Newson, * Ford XE Falcon * 1987 Mitsubishi Magna wagon * Holden VT Commodore * Ford AU Falcon * Ford Territory * Holden Commodore VE Sportswagon and Ute * Blueye Sport Goggle designed by Paul Cohen * Victa Lawn Mower * Bionic Ear * winged keel * VentrAssist Artificial Heart * Sunbeam Mixmaster * Test Series Cricket Helmet * R√òDE Podcaster microphoneThe Rode Podcaster ‚Äì Australian International Design Awards * Dolphin Torch * Enzie Spiral Stair  References  External links  * Australian Good Design Awards * Standards Australia * AIDA Facebook Page Category:Awards established in 1958 Category:Design awards Category:Industrial design Design Award Category:1958 establishments in Australia ","title":"Australian Good Design Awards"},{"id":"10131128","text":"Henry \\"Western Warrior\\" Coyle (born 8 July 1982) is a professional boxer from Geesala near Belmullet, County Mayo, Ireland who currently fights out of Chicago, US.Boxrec Fighter Page He won the WBF Light Middleweight title at the Royal Theatre in Castlebar on 12 August 2011 when he beat Italy's Elio Cotena on a technical knockout.

Merrie Melodies series directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on May 24, 1952, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. The cartoon is named after the Road Runner's catchphrase. Plot The cartoon opens with the Road Runner (Accelerati Incredibilus) being chased by the Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris), the action pausing while these taxon captions are displayed. Wile E. chases after the Road Runner with a knife and fork, striking and missing, and sticking the utensils into the road as the Road Runner accelerates away. He slumps on the ground and soon comes up with a new plan. #The Coyote attaches a spring-activated boxing glove to a large rock and hides behind it, hoping to strike the Road Runner. However, the tension in the spring causes the rock and Wile E. to be launched backwards instead of the glove forwards. The glove then retracts backwards and punches the stunned Coyote in the face. #Wile E.'s next plan is to traverse a tightwire and drop an anvil on the Road Runner. The anvil proves too heavy for the tightwire to handle, and Wile E. is stretched all the way to the ground and can be seen by the Road Runner, who taunts him before dashing off. Wile E. drops the anvil and is slung up into the air. Wile E. points expectantly at his backpack and pulls out a cord, hoping for a parachute; however, upon opening the pack, there is no parachute, simply common items like a hatchet and kitchen utensils. His expression darkens, and he produces a cartridge of ACME-branded aspirin, taking a few to alleviate the inevitable pain. He weakly waves at the camera as he takes the plunge. #The Coyote's next plan is to set out a water glass with two signs by it reading \\"Last Water for 300 MILES\\" and \\"Free Drink of Water\\". The glass is attached by string to a TNT device. Wile E. hides as he hears the approaching Road Runner, who stops at the water stand, but simply ignores the trap and speeds behind the hiding Coyote bearing a sign that reads \\"ROAD RUNNERS CAN'T READ AND DON'T DRINK\\". Furious at this revelation, the Coyote chases the Road Runner into a mine, but soon realizes he has no helmet or flashlight. He returns to the cap rack and dons a cap, and the Road Runner pulls up to him and provokes a chase through the mine. During this chase, the audience's viewpoint cuts alternately between a view inside the mine and a Pac-Man style map of the mine, the lights on the characters' caps color-coding their wearers in the latter period (green for Road Runner and red for Wile E.). After breaking his headlamp, Wile E. lights a match for light, but happens to be in a tunnel laden with explosives, which detonate, the explosion warping some cacti above ground into the word \\"YIPE!\\" #Back on the surface, Wile E. has loaded himself on a springboard in order to sling himself towards the passing Road Runner. When he cuts the rope holding him back, he is planted directly on the ground and the spring unfurls like a Slinky. #The Coyote is now waiting for the Road Runner to make a turn so that he can chase him with an abstrusely designed rocket. He lights the fuse with perfect timing, but unfortunately, the rocket fires directly up into the sky and explodes into a firework with an \\"EAT AT JOE'S\\" sign. #Wile E. attempts to use ACME's rocket-powered roller skates to chase the Road Runner. When the road takes a turn, however, the Coyote is propelled off the end, and finds himself briefly stranded on top of a high plateau, before being thrown up into the sky. As he falls, Coyote begins to pray and pulls out an \\"R.I.P.\\" wreath before crashing into the ground. An exhausted Wile E. climbs out of the hole and spots the \\"Free Drink of Water\\" stand from before. Anxious to quench his thirst but completely forgetting that this was the trap set earlier in the cartoon, he lifts the glass and the TNT explodes. #The fully recovered Coyote places a small railroad track, two bushes, himself, and an \\"R.R. STOP\\" sign in the middle of the road. This fails to stop the Road Runner, who mows down the Coyote and leaves him spread-eagled on the track to be flattened again by a train which appears on the track. The Road Runner relaxes on the balcony of the caboose, with a sign written as \\"THE END\\" attached to the caboose.

Going! Gosh! is a 1952 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on August 23, 1952, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  Plot  Wile E. Coyote attempts to catch the Road Runner using several methods: #As the Road Runner speeds at 130 mph across the mountain roads, the coyote fires a bow loaded with some dynamite attached to an arrow. However, it is just like that ‚Äî he fires the bow, and the dynamite explodes on himself. The middle portion of the arrow falls off. #The fuming Coyote loads himself onto a slingshot; however, the support breaks out of the ground and wedges him into a cactus. #Wile E. Coyote now tries covering the ground with quick-drying cement to stop the Road Runner dead. Unfortunately, the Road Runner cuts directly through it without being touched, and the Coyote is covered all over. Enraged, Wile E. attempts to follow, but the cement dries, leaving him frozen stiff like a statue. #Hoping to avoid being hit with loose ends, Wile hides himself under a manhole with an armed hand grenade, but the Road Runner passes through the road fast enough to drop a boulder on top of the cover, which prevents the Coyote from throwing the grenade out at the bird before it explodes. Dazed, Wile peeks out to inspect the cause, and the manhole cover, and then the boulder, land on his head. #Wile E. Coyote dresses as an attractive, blond hitch hiker holding a sign that says \\"Ole Virginy or Bust\\" in an attempt to lure the Road Runner, but the clever bird speeds right past him and uncovers the Coyote. The Road Runner returns with Wile E's wig, holding up a sign saying \\"I've Already Got a Date\\". #Using deception, the Coyote paints a realistic picture of a bridge and places it at the dead-end of a high-level road as displayed by a sign that the Coyote turns around to make the facade convincing. The Road Runner runs through the trick picture as if it was a real road. As the Coyote looks on, puzzled, he fails to see a truck emerging through the road in the painting, which promptly runs him over. Frustrated, the Coyote starts after Road Runner but tears through the painting and falls into the chasm, leaving dust in the air in the word, \\"OH, NO!\\" #Wile heaves a large boulder onto the winding mountain roads which the Road Runner is traveling. Eventually, the Road Runner and the boulder approach the same area, but the Road Runner slips just out of the way, while the boulder is pitched into the air, up a serac, and onto a new set of roads. The Coyote is out peeking at the roads, hoping to see the Road Runner crushed, but instead he is about to suffer the same fate. The boulder is approaching from behind, and Wile E. sees it coming but cannot escape fast enough (this gag is set to Wagner's \\"Rienzi\\" Overture). #The Coyote, hoping for technology to triumph, uses various ACME devices put together (an anvil, a weather balloon, a street cleaner's bin, and a fan) to create a makeshift air balloon. Floating in the clouds, he sees the Road Runner and releases the anvil, causing the balloon to quickly ascend until it stops. At this point, the string keeping it blown up unfurls, sending it flying through the air until it runs out of air. Coyote falls through the ground (passing the deflated balloon and the anvil), followed by the anvil falling on his head and the Road Runner passing over him just to embarrass him even further. #The Coyote, listening out for the Road Runner's beeping, drops from a high log and lunges towards the bird with a javelin, only to realise that the beeping came from a nearby truck, which the Coyote dives straight into, and is thus whacked into the air and wound around the log. The camera cuts to the truck to show that the Road Runner is driving.  Home video  Going! Going! Gosh! is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 DVD.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on September 19, 1953, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  Plot  Introduction: The Road Runner is \\"zipping along\\" by a train, and the camera zooms in and then freezes for his cod Latin name: Velocitus Tremenjus. When the cartoon restarts, the Road Runner leaves the train and runs onto the main roads, with the coyote watching from above. He glances from side to side, and the camera freezes for Wile E. Coyote (Road- Runnerus Digestus) halfway through his head turning. True to this name, he ventures down the mountain and toward the road, waiting for the familiar Beep- beep sound; when this reaches his ears, he jumps into a 4-way intersection, but the Road Runner mows him down from behind. When the seething coyote stands up, facing the opposite direction, he is flattened from the other side, and then eventually from all four directions. The camera cuts to Wile E., who looks increasingly annoyed as this sequence repeats over and over until the camera cuts away. 1\\\\. Lying in wait behind a rock with a hand grenade, the coyote mistakenly chews off the grenade and throws the stop at the Road Runner, and once Wile E. realizes the gaffe, KA-BOOM!. 2\\\\. Wile E. now inspects the roads from a high overlook and peers out to see that the Road Runner has disappeared temporarily. That ends when the bird pops up behind Wile E. and beeps, then dashes away, leaving behind a lifesize cloud of dust in his likeness that also beeps at the coyote. He reclines on the rail, miffed at the turn of events. 3\\\\. As the cartoon returns to the regular desert scenery, Wile E. gingerly drops a bunch of mousetraps onto the road, but when the Road Runner zooms past, instead of getting trapped in them, the traps drop onto Wile in his trench hideout. The coyote's reaction is delayed briefly before he leaps into the air, screaming in pain. 4\\\\. Resorting now to ACME products, these being a kite kit and bomb, Wile E. leaps in the air several times in an attempt to go airborne, but soon runs off the edge of the cliff he is on, and he falls to the ground and his own bomb explodes on him. 5\\\\. The Road Runner is zipping along some roads while Wile E. is chopping down a telephone pole. He confirms the path of the Road Runner and finishes chopping, but is too late to realize he has still miscalculated. The pole traverses the road and is followed by all of the other poles connected by the same power lines. Thus, the pole directly to the left of the one Wile E. chopped down pounds him into the ground. 6\\\\. Living up to the Wile E. part of his name, Coyote offers bird seed mixed with steel shot to the Road Runner, who stops his road-burning and has a quick snack. Wile E. jumps out behind the bird as he speeds away with a giant magnet, but lucky only he could be, a big TNT canister is attracted to the magnet and another explosion results, twisting the magnet into a pretzel and knocking Wile E. back through a rock face. 7\\\\. Delving deeper into wily trickery, Coyote learns hypnotism from a book to induce the Road Runner to jump off a cliff. He tests the method successfully on a small bug by projecting a static lightning from his hands. However, when he jumps out and tries to hit the Road Runner with it, the bird is already wise, holding a mirror that causes the lightning to be reflected back to Wile E. who obligingly walks off the cliff having succeeded in hypnotising himself. 8\\\\. The Road Runner taunts his opponent from above, and Coyote attempts to use a seesaw and rock contraption, but the rock simply falls directly back on its owner. 9\\\\. Now, Wile E. sets a gun trap for the Road Runner, with himself ready to activate the guns at a moment's notice. He hides behind a turn as the Road Runner runs into the trap. However, because of the force he applied to the strings, the guns are pulled into the crosshairs of the Coyote when they are activated, and he ends up shooting himself. 10\\\\. Coyote now hides behind a rock as he waits for the Road Runner to speed across a treacherous suspension bridge. As the Road Runner crosses, Wile E. jumps out and cuts the ropes, but instead of causing the bridge to fall, the whole plateau that Wile E. inhabits falls down. The Road Runner brakes at the end of the bridge and continues his rampage. 11\\\\. Wile E. waits for the Road Runner to pass and then loads himself into a \\"human cannonball\\" cannon, which recoils and is thrown backwards, leaving Coyote blackened. 12\\\\. Coyote is now on top of a rectangular board bridging a deep canyon with a large wrecking ball at his command. He drops the ball into a circular path, which would have hit the Road Runner if the bird hadn't stopped and waited. The ball continues its circle and ends up right back where it started...on top of Coyote. 13\\\\. One last time, Coyote attempts to ensnare his nemesis. He mines a canyon with myriad explosives behind a doorway with many \\"FREE BIRD SEED\\" declarations and connects the main controller to the door. However, as soon as Coyote climbs over the wall, he encounters a gigantic truck. With no recourse, Wile E. opens the door, gets blown up and then gets run over by the truck. The cartoon ends with a charred and disoriented Wile E. sticking out his tongue and letting out a \\"beep, beep\\" in an imitation of the Road Runner, then falling unconscious.

The movement used shocking, irrational, or absurd imagery and Freudian dream symbolism to challenge the traditional function of art to represent reality. Related to Dada cinema, Surrealist cinema is characterized by juxtapositions, the rejection of dramatic psychology, and a frequent use of shocking imagery. Philippe Soupault and Andr√© Breton‚Äôs 1920 book collaboration Les Champs Magn√©tiquesAndr√© Breton, Compl√®tes, T. I, ed. Marguerite Bonnet (≈íuvres Paris: Gallimard, 1988), 51-105. is often considered to be the first Surrealist work, but it was only once Breton had completed his Surrealist Manifesto in 1924 that ‚ÄòSurrealism drafted itself an official birth certificate.‚ÄôAs agreed by interviewer and interviewee. Breton and Parinaud, 71 Surrealist films of the twenties include Rene Clair's Entr'acte (1924), Fernand Leger's Ballet Mechanique (1924), Jean Renoir's La Fille de L'eau (1924), Marcel Duchamp's Anemic Cinema (1926), Jean Epstein's Fall of the House of Usher (1928) (with Luis Bu√±uel assisting), Watson and Webber's Fall of the House of Usher (1928)Em Gee Film Library, Catalog 83 (no date) Murray Glass,Editorial assistant Rhoda Friedman and Germaine Dulac's The Seashell and the Clergyman (1928) (from a screenplay by Antonin Artaud). Other films include Un Chien Andalou and L'Age d'Or by Bu√±uel and Salvador Dal√≠; Bu√±uel went on to direct many more films, never denying his surrealist roots. Ingmar Bergman said \\"Bu√±uel nearly always made Bu√±uel films\\".  Theory  In his 2006 book Surrealism and Cinema, Michael Richardson argues that surrealist works cannot be defined by style or form, but rather as results of the practice of surrealism. Richardson writes: \\"Within popular conceptions, surrealism is misunderstood in many different ways, some of which contradict others, but all of these misunderstandings are founded in the fact that they seek to reduce surrealism to a style or a thing in itself rather than being prepared to see it as an activity with broadening horizons. Many critics fail to recognize the distinctive qualities that make up the surrealist attitude. They seek something ‚Äì a theme, a particular type of imagery, certain concepts ‚Äì they can identify as 'surrealist' in order to provide a criterion of judgement by which a film or artwork can be appraised. The problem is that this goes against the very essence of surrealism, which refuses to be here but is always elsewhere. It is not a thing but a relation between things and therefore needs to be treated as a whole. Surrealists are not concerned with conjuring up some magic world that can be defined as 'surreal'. Their interest is almost exclusively in exploring the conjunctions, the points of contact, between different realms of existence. Surrealism is always about departures rather than arrivals.\\" Rather than a fixed aesthetic, Richardson defines surrealism as \\"a shifting point of magnetism around which the collective activity of the surrealists revolves.\\" Surrealism draws upon irrational imagery and the subconscious mind. Surrealists should not, however, be mistaken as whimsical or incapable of logical thought; rather, most Surrealists promote themselves as revolutionaries.  History  Surrealism was the first literary and artistic movement to become seriously associated with cinema, though it has also been a movement largely neglected by film critics and historians. However, shortlived though its popularity was, it became known for its dream-like quality, juxtaposition of everyday people and objects in irrational forms, and the abstraction of real life, places, and things. Highly influenced by Freudian psychology, surrealism sought to bring the unconscious mind to visual life. \\"Balanced between symbolism and realism, surrealist cinema commentated on themes of life, death, modernity, politics, religion, and art itself.\\" The foundations of the movement began in France and coincided with the birth of motion pictures. France served as the birthplace of surrealist cinema because of a fortunate combination of easy access to film equipment, film financing, and a plethora of interested artists and audiences. The Surrealists who participated in the movement were among the first generation to have grown up with film as a part of daily life. Breton himself, even before the launching of the movement, possessed an avid interest in film: while serving in the First World War, he was stationed in Nantes and, during his spare time, would frequent the movie houses with a superior named Jacques Vach√©. According to Breton, he and Vach√© ignored movie titles and times, preferring to drop in at any given moment and view the films without any foreknowledge. When they grew bored, they left and visited the next theater. Breton's movie-going habits supplied him with a stream of images with no constructed order about them. He could juxtapose the images of one film with those of another, and from the experience craft his own interpretation. Referring to his experiences with Vach√©, he once remarked, \\"I think what we [valued] most in it, to the point of taking no interest in anything else, was its power to disorient.\\" Breton believed that film could help one abstract himself from \\"real life\\" whenever he felt like it. Serials, which often contained cliffhanger effects and hints of \\"other worldliness,\\" were attractive to early Surrealists. Examples include Houdini's daredevil deeds and the escapades of Musidora and Pearl White in detective stories. What endeared Surrealists most to the genre was its ability to evoke and sustain a sense of mystery and suspense in viewers. The Surrealists saw in film a medium which nullified reality's boundaries. Film critic Ren√© Gardies wrote in 1968, \\"Now the cinema is, quite naturally, the privileged instrument for derealising (sic) the world. Its technical resources... allied with its photo-magic, provide the alchemical tools for transforming reality.\\" Surrealist artists were interested in cinema as a medium for expression. As cinema continued to develop in the 1920s, many Surrealists saw in it an opportunity to portray the ridiculous as rational. \\"Surrealist artists realized that the film camera could capture the real world in a dreamlike way that their pens and paintbrushes could not: superimpositions, overexposures, fast-motion, slow- motion, reverse-motion, stop-motion, lens flares, large depth of field, shallow depth of field, and more bizarre camera tricks could transform the original image in front of the lens into something new once exposed on the film plate. For surrealists, film gave them the ability to challenge and mold the boundaries between fantasy and reality, especially with space and time. Like the dreams they wished to bring to life, film had no limits or rules.\\" Cinema provided more convincing illusions than its closest rival, theatre, and the tendency for Surrealists to express themselves through film was a sign of their confidence in the adaptability of cinema to Surrealism's goals and requirements. They were the first to take seriously the resemblance between film's imaginary images and those of dreams and the unconscious. Luis Bu√±uel said, \\"The film seems to be the involuntary imitation of the dream.\\" Surrealist filmmakers sought to re-define human awareness of reality by illustrating that the \\"real\\" was little more than what was perceived as real; that reality was subject to no limits beyond those mankind imposed upon it. Breton once compared the experience of Surrealist literature to \\"the point at which the waking state joins sleep.\\" His analogy helps to explain the advantage of cinema over books in facilitating the kind of release Surrealists sought from their daily pressures. The modernity of film was appealing to as well. Critics have debated whether \\"Surrealist film\\" constitutes a distinct genre. Recognition of a cinematographic genre involves the ability to cite many works which share thematic, formal, and stylistic traits. To refer to Surrealism as a genre is to imply that there is repetition of elements and a recognizable, \\"generic formula\\" which describes their makeup. Several critics have argued that, due to Surrealism's use of the irrational and on non- sequitur, it is impossible for Surrealist films to constitute a genre. While there are numerous films which are true expressions of the movement, many other films which have been classified as Surrealist simply contain Surrealist fragments. Rather than \\"Surrealist film\\" the more accurate term for such works may be \\"Surrealism in film.\\"  Surrealist films and filmmakers = Films of the Parisian Surrealist Group  *Entr'acte: a 22-minute, silent French film, written by Ren√© Clair and Francis Picabia, and directed by Clair, released December 4, 1924. *The Seashell and the Clergyman: a 31-minute, silent film, written by Antonin Artaud, and directed by Germaine Dulac, released in February 1928. *L'√âtoile de Mer: a 15-minute silent French film written and directed by Man Ray, released in 1928. *Un Chien Andalou: a 21-minute, silent French film, written by Salvador Dal√≠ and Luis Bu√±uel, and directed by Bu√±uel, released in 1929. *Les Myst√®res du Ch√¢teau de D√©: a 27 minute silent French film written and directed by Man Ray, released in 1929. *L'Age d'Or: a 60-minute French film with sound, written by Dal√≠ and Bu√±uel, and directed by Bu√±uel, released in 1930.  Later films  Joseph Cornell produced surrealist films in the United States in the later 1930s (such as Rose Hobart in 1936). Antonin Artaud, Philippe Soupault, and Robert Desnos wrote screenplays for later films. Salvador Dal√≠ designed a dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's film Spellbound (1945). It was one of the first American films to use psychoanalysis as a major element of the story. Hitchcock wanted to capture the vividness of dreams as never before and felt that Dal√≠ was the person to help him do so.

There it is situated near the \\"Maas\\" (\\"Meuse\\") river in the southwestern part of the province of Limburg. Oost is the larger part of the merged administrative population centre of Oost-Maarland, which is part of the municipality of Eijsden-Margraten. This municipality borders with Belgium to the south and to the west. To the west that border mostly corresponds with the Meuse river. As Oost is situated in the westernmost part of this municipality, to the west its outlying area borders the Meuse river and Belgium. Oost has more than 600 inhabitants and is situated south of the city of Maastricht and 3 kilometers north of Eijsden, which is the largest place in the municipality. History Dalhem county with upperleft the \\"ban\\" of Oost The region around Oost has a complex history, but significantly, many centuries ago, Oost was a seignory and its own municipality and a \\"ban\\" (judicial district) of the Dalhem county. Since the Peace of M√ºnster in 1648 it is part of the Northern Netherlands. In 1828, Oost was merged with the nearby Eijsden municipality. At the same time Maarland, the separate village a few hundred meters to the south east, that was part of another municipality also became part of Eijsden, and was joined with Oost. The name of this new 'administrative centre' became \\"Oost-Maarland\\". On January 1, 2011 the Eijsden municipality merged with the neighbouring municipality of Margraten and so Oost became part of the Eijsden- Margraten municipality. Name perils The name \\"Oost-Maarland\\" could lead to some confusion as \\"Oost\\" is also the Dutch word for \\"East\\", so it might be expected to be the eastern part of the merged village (or a place called Maarland). Oost and Maarland are situated beside one other, but Oost (despite its name) is the western part, near the river Meuse and Maarland is the southeastern part of the community. In fact, \\"Oost en Maarland\\" (\\"Oost and Maarland\\") would be a clearer place-name. The origin of the name \\"Oost\\" has surprisingly nothing to do with location. It is said to be derived from \\"Augusta\\". Once Saint Augusta of Treviso was the patron saint of the village, that then was called \\"Augustakirchen\\", after the church, that then was there, dedicated to that saint. By the 18th century already the name had been deformed to \\"Aoust\\"). Economy Intensive apple growing The main economic activities in the village have, for generations, been (and still partially are with several working farms): * Fruit growing (apples, pears, prunes, cherries, strawberries). * Grain growing (wheat, barley, corn) * Cattle farming (milk cows, hen's eggs) Naturally jobs in industry and services in nearby larger settlements have been and still are providing employment to villagers. Furthermore, since a number of farms have lost (a considerable part of) their agricultural land to several causes, such as extraction of grit in the river area and small industrial as well as housing projects, most of them have been rebuilt thus, that in former business buildings like stables now touristic apartments are rented out. Culture *Apart from a citizen soldiery, which has its own yearly events, there's other folklore in this village, like in many other villages in this region, on their separate festival days with a religious background. This festival, called the \\"Bronk\\", starts on a Sunday in June, July or August with a procession in which the priest carries the Blessed Sacrament through the streets of the village, which for that occasion are festively decked. A typical element of these processions is the fact that on multiple stops in their route temporary altars are built, in front of which flower carpets have been laid out.Image of a flower carpet in front of a street altar When these piousnesses have ended around noon, two or three days of feasting follow. One folkloristic part of this event is the round dancing called \\"Cramignon\\", which also takes place in the streets, whereas the involved are moving from caf√© to caf√©, (but not to drink coffee).article about the Cramignon round dance as part of the Bronk *For a long time constantly a number of inhabitants of this village have been either musicians or board members of the military band St. Cecile, which is based in the neighbouring Eijsden and has several times ended on the first place in the highest Concert division of the World Music Contest at Kerkrade. Results of the 16th WMC in 2013 Nature Near Oost the Albert Canal is connected with the Meuse river through the Lanaye canal To the west and northwest of the village a considerable part of its former fruit-tree area were lost by the extraction of grit, which was abundantly present in the soil near the river.

Look! And Hasten! is a 1954 Warner Bros.Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on August 14, 1954, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. The title is a play on the railroad crossing safety phrase \\"stop, look, and listen\\". Plot Introduction: A famished Wile E. Coyote (Eatibus Anythingus) trudges across the desert floor, catching and eating anything that he finds to satisfy himself, ranging from a fly to an empty tin can, before being flattened by the Road Runner (Hot- roddicus Supersonicus). Wile E., after recovering, blinks his eyes and visualizes a wonderful Road Runner feast. Seeing no need for a comparatively tawdry can, he chases the Road Runner. Wile's low stance reduces his drag and allows him to approach the Road Runner until the bird rockets away. The coyote's eyes pop out of his sockets and he is left dejectedly planning his next scheme. #First, Wile E. uses a pulley, rope and rock trap to smash the passing Road Runner, evidently hoping the extra complexity will stop himself from being squashed instead. No dice; Wile E. is squashed by the rock as the Road Runner stops and mocks him. #The clearly angry Coyote, with a lasso in the road, listens for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso first, dragging the coyote across the hard ground. Wile E. is left with a bare rear end from friction as he paces off the road. #The Coyote builds a Burmese tiger trap according to a How-To book: dig a square pit in the road and fill it with a sheet camouflaged as road. He hides behind a rock and, hearing the Road Runner beep and the trap activate, dives in to capture his prey... only to instantly re-emerge all white and flee in terror, after which a real Burmese tiger (Surprisibus! Surprisibus!), stealthily climbs out of the trap and stalks off. #The camera displays a road with a pop-up steel grate intended to block the Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner. The Coyote unsuccessfully tries numerous methods of unspringing the grate, then resumes the chase in outrage and is soon stopped by a railroad crossing. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis as he slowly prances the tracks, and the coyote is lifted into the air by the striped divider. After falling back down, Wile E. chases the Road Runner down the tracks, which run through mountains. The two pass by opposite lanes and the Road Runner signals the coyote, who stops cold after a few seconds and turns back, and after again running past the bird, he reverses only to find the Road Runner has escaped to a lower track. When he finally pursues the bird across the correct track, Wile is stopped by a train, and dashes in and out of a rockface; he sees the train proceed across an inferior track, and sighs with relief until a second train approaches from inside the rock. The apoplectic coyote holds up a circular STOP IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY\\" sign, but since Wile E. is not human, nothing happens except for the crash. # Next, Wile E. digs a corrugated culvert intending to mine the road with TNT, but the wires are short enough that he pulls the detonator over, which squeezes onto a loose rock and explodes the TNT while Wile inhabits the culvert. # The Coyote starts a speed motorcycle in pursuit of a passing Road Runner, but simply slams into a tree and is then jiggled around by the intense engine vibrations. # Now, Wile E. baits a white circle in the middle of a wide suspension bridge with bird seed, then hides underneath the bridge to cut out the circle as the Road Runner feasts. Instead, Wile falls along with the entirety of the bridge except for the bird and circle left floating in midair. # Finally, the Coyote attempts to outrun his rival by ingesting a family sized box of ACME Triple- Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins. With his legs transformed into those of a track star, he burns rubber on the road and dashes off, leaving the highway on fire. The Road Runner watches his foe approach and, from a standing start with a tongue-flapping beep, matches that speed instantly with about a one-second lead. This warp-speed chase continues, with the Coyote getting as close as a half-second at a valley and the Road Runner gaining distance on uphill grades, until they pass by the cranked-up grate, which finally rises for only Wile E. to smash into. The bird brakes and views the steel imprint of his hapless rival before burning more rubber on the road, spelling out \\"That's all, Folks!\\" in smoke. The cartoon then fades to the regular end title card of the era before fading out.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on April 30, 1955, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot Introduction: The Road Runner is in the middle of the road, and after surveying his surroundings, dashes at hyperspeed onto a low plateau (Speedipus Rex), then continues to mountain roads and leaves dust clouds everywhere. Meanwhile, Wile E. Coyote (Famishus-Famishus) emerges from his cave after a good-night's sleep and is soon fully awoken by a Beep-beep. He peeks over the plateau to see the Road Runner at the bottom and strides down the vertical edge with eating utensils, in pursuit of breakfast. The Road Runner taunts his nemesis by dodging at the last possible moment, allowing the coyote to slam into the rock floor. The chase moves to the real roads, and the Road Runner taunts him with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 187, disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 6 frames of film, causing Wile E.'s entire jaw to hang open and then drop out as he enters a cloud. The coyote trails dust as he reclines on a low rock to dream his next plan. 1\\\\. Wile E. covers an entire section of a canyon with glue, making sure to leave space for himself to stand. However, the approaching \\"beep\\" belongs to a truck and not the Road Runner, and thus the coyote lacks sufficient time to escape the glue; he tries anyway and cannot leap far enough before he gets stuck, and can only watch as he is flattened. Wile E. thus tries another method: covering a low rockface with glue and preparing, from a distance, to throw dynamite at the Road Runner. However, the bird's velocity causes the glue to part sideways, drowning Wile E. in his hiding place and preventing him from throwing the dynamite. After failing at this and at blowing out the fuse, he begins walking with his hips (his legs are glued to the stick) in an effort to allow the wind to snuff or slow the burning fuse, then jumps into a nearby river; however, the explosive detonates about three feet above, and the coyote pauses in midair before he falls into the water. 2\\\\. A detour sign points through a hollow log, and the Road Runner \\"falls\\" for the trap by dashing in at full speed. The camera zooms out to show that the exit leads only to air, but does not show the Road Runner; it then cuts to him perched on the very edge of the log. Wile E. is puzzled and climbs into the log; the bird beeps and exits out a hole in the top, and the coyote peeks out after him, but his weight causes the log to tip over the cliff. 3\\\\. Now, the coyote hopes to flatten the bird with a 10,000-lb weight supported by a pair of pulleys. However, the weight does not drop when the coyote lets go of the rope, only falling on the coyote when he resumes the chase. Wile E. strolls into view postured like a walking barchair. 4\\\\. Seeing the Road Runner approach his cliff lair, Wile E. lights a sequence of fireworks attached to a lasso, but the Road Runner is actually running down a different cliff, and the coyote inertially spins the lasso until the hissing fireworks explode. 5\\\\. Next, Wile E. loads himself into a slingshot and retreats for maximum velocity, until he backs into a beeping Road Runner; the slingshot fires before he can grab the bird, and the coyote flies two feet above the ground, into a tunnel, and is squashed into a passing truck's grille. 6\\\\. Wile E. uses an outboard motor, a jim-dandy wagon, a wash tub, water, and roller skates to create a hydropowered wagon that will hopefully lead him on his quest. He soon passes a DANGER BRIDGE OUT sign and cannot stop the wagon from running off the bridge; he finally unties himself from the wagon by the moment he reaches thin air, but sees the rope dropping to the road below and, worst of all, the wagon arriving safely at the other end of the bridge. The coyote funereally waves at the camera before he plummets into the road. 7\\\\. Wile E. observes the Road Runner's trajectory across the mountain and ignites a rocket aimed at a particular location. The camera cuts to both the rocket and the Road Runner chicken-style until the rocket hits its target location, but just after his enemy. The rocket continues down through the mountain and out of a mine before giving up the ghost. Wile E. sighs with relief ‚Äî and then the rocket explodes. 8\\\\. The coyote uses a female Road Runner costume to attract his counterpart, but instead ends up attracting a rout of coyotes that all look identical to him. Then they chase him down the road as the real Road Runner pulls into view with a sign that reads THE END.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on December 10, 1955, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  Plot  Introduction: Wile E. Coyote is cooking some food in a tin bucket over a fire. He adds pepper and a drop of a brown liquid, and stirs the bucket and fishes out what is revealed to be a tin can. The Coyote then sits down on a rock and prepares to cut the can in half (as if it was a steak) before he realizes what he is eating, and then pushes the entire table setting off the rock table. \\"COYOTE - Eatibus Almost Anythingus\\". With a Beep-beep, the Roadrunner speeds by and throws the coyote rolling across the ground. The camera cuts to the Road Runner, who is currently a blur of motion, and freezes the clip temporarily to add his fictitious Latin name \\"Velocitus Delectiblus\\". Wile licks his lips, then dashes after his nemesis. The Road Runner taunts Wile E. with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 225, disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 5 frames of film, dusting up all the roads in the distance. Wile stops in mid-stride and points at the bird as if to say \\"Did you see that?\\", then thinks of his new plan on the next scheme. 1\\\\. The Coyote attaches an arrowhead to the end of his nose and shoots himself from a bow at the passing Road Runner, but instead spears through the trunk of a saguaro, which breaks out of the ground and falls over a cliff. 2\\\\. Wile then loads himself into a slingshot and cuts the string as the Road Runner dashes ahead of him, but nothing happens. He ducks out of the slingshot and puts his head into it to peer at the \\"faulty\\" string, but then it activates and pitches the Coyote onto the stone ground 10 feet away. 3\\\\. The Coyote lies in wait for the Road Runner to come around a turn and lights a cannon fuse, but instead of firing the cannonball, the entire cannon, with Wile on board, is fired backwards into a mountain wall. When Wile steps out of the cannon, it fires another ball into his face. 4\\\\. He then attempts to use a stone \\"wrecking ball\\" attached to a tree to hit the Roadrunner, but instead hits the trunk of the tree, which hammers him into the rock he is standing on. 5\\\\. Next, Wile simply rolls the ball down a hill out into the road, but it pitches up a stone serac and right back on top of its owner. 6\\\\. Wile covers a narrow canyon floor with Acme GREASE, but once again, a truck just happens to be approaching. He tries to run across the grease, but fails and is run over. The Road Runner easily glides over it, so he attempts to follow. However, each attempt moves him forward a negligible amount of distance until he finally collapses in the grease. 7\\\\. The Road Runner is then seen zipping to one end of a cliff and beeping at the Coyote on the other end, who attempts to swing over the canyon but only smacks into a plateau just underneath him. 8\\\\. Wile leaves out bird seed while he climbs to the top of the cliff and prepares his trap. The Road Runner zips up and munches down, while the Coyote lowers a dynamite stick on the end of a fishing line. Instead of blowing up the Road Runner, the flame travels up the line and back to the TNT box, which explodes on the Coyote. 9\\\\. He then creates a tar-and-feather machine based on his readings of How To Tar And Feather A Road Runner: 10th printing, and successfully tests it on a small cactus. Wile hides in a thin crevice with the machine pointed towards the road that the Road Runner traverses. Unfortunately, the emitters are spun around by the Road Runner's speed and attack their owner, and the Road Runner, as if it were the simplest thing in the world (which it is), holds up a sign saying: ROAD-RUNNERS ALREADY HAVE FEATHERS! 10\\\\. Wile prepares one final trap: a dynamite pit in the road. Just after he lights the fuse, the Road Runner stops short of him and beeps in his face, provoking a short chase that ends when he runs directly over his own exploding pit. Dejected, the charred Coyote walks off-camera and returns with a stand-up sign that says: Wanted: One gullible Coyote. Apply to manager of this theater. Then he goes back and returns with the Looney Tunes \\"That's all, Folks!\\" end title card.

Constructed in 1989, it is located on the southwest corner of Round Grove Road and the portion of Interstate 35E known as Stemmons Freeway. It contains 105 Stores, four of which are anchor tenants: Dillard's Clearance Center, Macy's (formerly Foley's), Cinemark, and Zion Market (formerly Sears). Atrium Court East Concourse History Exterior depiction of Vacant 2nd level west facing entrance. The mall had its grand opening on October 4, 1989, with Sears and Dillard's as its initial anchor stores. By March 1990, an additional 19 stores had opened including The Gap, Casual Corner, and The Limited and Vista Ridge Mall was 65 percent leased. The mall added a third anchor store when JCPenney opened its Vista Ridge Mall store on August 1, 1990. The fourth anchor store to open was a Foley's, a unit of May Department Stores, as part of an expansion push by the chain, with its Vista Ridge Mall location holding its dedication in 1991. In 1991, the mall underwent interior renovations to make the indoor areas more appealing. When Vista Ridge Mall opened in 1989, it included a 12-screen Cinemark theater, whose marquee and ticket office were in the center court of the mall. In 2006, Cinemark constructed an attached 15-screen movie theater to the mall (it contains entrances both inside and outside the mall) and relocated there upon completion (the original theater has since remained unused). Foley's would be re-branded as Macy's in September 2006, as a part of the Federated Department Stores acquisition and re-branding of May Company properties. The mall was sold on live auction in October 2017 to the highest bidder, Texas businessman John Bushman, of ICA Properties. It was renamed Music City Mall, Lewisville. On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide. The store closed in September 2018.https://starlocalmedia.com/lewisvilleleader/news/sears-to-close- lewisville-location/article_2c6f3a02-6529-11e8-bf0a-734590b651f2.html Zion announced its purchase and plans to open in Lewisville by the third quarter 2019 in the former Sears. Dillard's announced in early 2019 it would transition into Clearance Center by May. On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would also be closing as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. The store completed its liquidation on the 23rd of June.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are-the-154-stores-jc-penney- will-soon-close-2020-06-04  Identity transformation  Since its re-branding and transition to a music-focused identity, the mall has been a key supporter of the local music and arts scene. By ensuring adherence to strict safety policies, it was able to resume live performances while they were suspended at most area music venues during the pandemic. With multiple live performances seven days a week, consistency has made the mall a valued anchor that helps sustain local musicians.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on November 10, 1956, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot Wile E. Coyote, apparently famished, wads up a bunch of mud to make a lookalike chicken. He shovels it in an adobe oven, then one he is done roasting it he sits down to \\"eat\\" it, with less than perfect results (a tooth falls off his mouth in the process). So he makes a second fixture - a trash can - and throws the \\"chicken\\" in it, proving he is indeed Famishius Fantasticus. An object bowls everything over and the \\"chicken\\" in the \\"trash can\\" lands on him. A question mark appears. Wile E. looks out to see what has everything bowled over. Its name and Latin name appears Roadrunner (dig-outtis tid-bittius). The bird beeps and zooms away starting the chase. Wile E. takes a straight-line shortcut instead of the road to catch up. Before Wile E. can come close, however, the Road Runner sets the road ablaze with his blinding speed, causing Wile E. to burn his feet. He stomps out the fire on his paws, but finds his tail is also burning. Wile E., thinking fast, witches for water to cool his tail off. The Coyote rages at the camera, but nothing can be done except plan the next scheme. 1\\\\. Wile E. uses his frequent idea: swing from a high place armed with a javelin, looking to spear the Road Runner. This time, he simply plows into the ground as the Road Runner calmly passes on the right. 2\\\\. The Coyote stuffs a gun on a spring into a ground compartment and locks it with a safety lock, hoping to shoot his enemy, but due to the excessive spring force, the gun does a 180 and ends up on the opposite side of the Coyote, pointed in his face upside down. Wile E. plugs the barrel with his finger but still gets blasted in the face. The gun retracts back to the hole in the ground, pulling its owner with it. 3\\\\. Wile E. attaches himself to a tree catapult to throw himself towards a passing Road Runner, but instead he bounces himself on the ground and suffers repeating back and forth faceplants as the tree continually stretches to either side. 4\\\\. To block the Road Runner, the Coyote attaches a bunch of maces to a string and pole, and unwinds the string when he hears the bird approaching. It's an effective obstacle, and would have stopped the Road Runner except that the pole lifts itself out of the ground and drops on the hiding Coyote before the Road Runner passes. Wile E. is battered and tied up by the end of the fracas. 5\\\\. This time, the Coyote uses deception. He posts a detour and bridges a crevasse with a ladder that he has sabotaged with a cut in the structure, which will make it collapse if passed over. He hears the Road Runner, but doesn't see him, and he looks up to see the Road Runner safely perched on top of a high cliff, watching his every move. The angry Coyote uses his own broken ladder to climb up to the top, with predictably disastrous results. Wile E. falls into the canyon, grabs onto the second section of the ladder to alleviate the fall, and continues into the ground through each rung on the way down. 6\\\\. Now, Wile E. loads a circle of explosives into the center of a tire. He rolls the tire down a hill to meet the Road Runner, but the explosives stay behind and blow up their user. 7\\\\. The Coyote is loaded into a massive missile to chase the Road Runner, but when he sets it off, instead of launching the missile, he only launches himself out of it and through a rock face. He emerges from the resulting hole, blackened. 8\\\\. The final gag in this cartoon involves a pack of rocks from on high, ready to fall on the Road Runner when the trap door opens. But when Wile E. opens the trap door, the rocks remain intact because they're too densely packed. To try and fix this, the Coyote first runs to the top and stomps on them; no dice. Next, he procures a long, thin stick and uses it like an ice pick to force them out while standing under them. Pebbles start to fall, followed by stones then rocks. Wile E. finally comes to his senses and raises a sign: \\"IN HEAVEN'S NAME - WHAT AM I DOING?\\" (Also used in the next Road Runner cartoon) Too late; Wile E. drops the long thin stick and raises a tiny parasol to prepare for the resulting impact of huge rocks, and after the impact, a long lump forms on the Coyote's head with a white flag making the lump look like a flagpole. The flag reads \\"THE END\\" while it waves in the wind, accompanied by the song: \\"Taps\\".

The library was previously named as \\"Central Public Library\\" between 2004 and 2010. The library is located in Dhaka's Shahbag neighbourhood. The auditorium (Shawkat Osman Auditorium) of the library is a major venue for cultural events in Dhaka, including the International Short and Independent Film Festival. It also houses the Library Training Institute funded and managed by the Library Association of Bangladesh (LAB). It also has a reprography service, in-house bindery and conservation section. History The foundation stone for Dhaka Central Public Library was laid in 1954 with the Registrar of Dhaka University as part-time Librarian.Parker, J. Stephen (1979), Bangladesh public library survey final report, vol. 1, p. 49, Library Development Consultants, London Designated to be the centre for the public library system in the then East Pakistan on the basis of the recommendations made by Australian Library consultant Mr. L C Key in 1955,Mannan, S.M.(1990), Library professional in Bangladesh: A study of their social background, The Dhaka University Studies, Part-A, 47(2), p. 114, Dhaka University, Dhaka it was opened to the public on 22 March 1958 with a stock of 10,040 books. In 1978 the library moved to its building near the Shahbag Intersection from its original building designed by pioneering Bangladeshi architect Mazharul Islam, which went on to house the Dhaka University Central Library. The Department of the Public Libraries was established with Bangladesh Central Public Library as its headquarters in 1984. Between 1980 and 1985 UNESCO provided nearly 9.9 million Bangladeshi taka to develop the library. The library has undergone a number of name changes. Previously it was named the Sufia Kamal National Public Library after the Bangladeshi writer Begum Sufia Kamal. However, in 2004 the name was changed to the \\"Central Public Library\\", amid protests from cultural activists who cited Sufia Kamal worthy of the honour. However, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party State Minister for Cultural Affairs, Selina Rahman, defended the decision at the time, stating, \\"We're not changing the name, rather restoring it to its original one. Our aim is not to name any government institution after any person.\\" However, in 2010 the subsequent Awami League administration again changed the name back to Sufia Kamal National Public Library. Collection As of March 2007, the Library had 119,750 books in its collection, including old and rare books with historical value, along with a small valuable collection of 40 to 50 manuscripts titles for research and reference services. Books in the collection are mostly in Bengali and English, as well as other languages including Urdu, Hindi, Arabic and Persian. As a depository library, it deposits all Bangladeshi publications under the Copyright. The Library receives most of the Bangladeshi daily newspapers and periodicals. It also has a special collection of juvenile material and is providing separate reading facilities for children. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system with minor modifications is used to organise library materials. Library hours The library remains open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on all days except Fridays and national holidays. On 26 July 2003 started 24 hours reader service, which ceased on 1 March 2004 since drug abusers were taking opportunity of those hours. The district and branch libraries managed by the Department of Public Libraries remain open from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on all days except Fridays and government holidays. Lending facilities were introduced in 1994. As of 2004, the average number of readers was about 2,500 a day.

Coyote (Eternalii Famishiis) and the Road Runner (Tastyus Supersonicus) are continuing their chase through the twisty roads of the desert. As Wile E. closes in on the Road Runner, a 4-way intersection is reached and the Road Runner takes a left turn. Wile E. looks back as he brakes himself into the dirt, not noticing a \\"DANGER BRIDGE OUT\\" sign, and thus falls off the edge of the plateau and bursts a hole in his shape in the ground below. The Coyote walks out of the hole in disgust and plans his next scheme. 1\\\\. Thinking simple, the Coyote attempts to simply trip the Road Runner with a fake coyote foot (to avoid unpleasant repercussions on himself), but only ends up getting the fake foot winded. As he walks out, he kneels on the leg and scratches his head, only for the leg to unreel itself, twisting his body in turn. 2\\\\. Wile E. broods in the dirt, and soon comes up with a new plan: Throw out a dynamite stick with a string. However, when Wile E. circles the string over his head, it lassos itself around the coyote's face before exploding. 3\\\\. Going for speed again, the Coyote then builds a contraption made from a fan, a sail, and roller skates to propel himself down the road.

Next, Wile E. holds onto a large fireworks-type rocket and lights it as the Road Runner passes, hoping to give semi-aerial chase. However, the firework takes off without its owner, flaying the coyote's chest in the process, and then it hits a curve and reverses itself, also flaying Wile's p√¢t√© and behind. The Coyote sulks off in the process. 5\\\\. Devious doesn't apply to the next simple trap: Wile E. tries to pull a large boulder onto one end of a see-saw to launch himself towards the Road Runner on a high cliff, but the boulder squashes him instead. 6\\\\. Wile E. pushes an anvil tied to a balloon off an outcropping, and then pulls the string when he hears the Road Runner, trying to flatten his nemesis. The anvil and the Road Runner converge towards the same spot in the bridge the Road Runner is now on, but the Road Runner brakes just in time to avoid it. The anvil smashes through the bridge, is thrown back up through the hole by a power line, and drops towards the Coyote who is perched on the very edge of the outcropping. Shivering with fear, Wile E. covers his head, preparing for the impact. The anvil misses him, but instead breaks through another part of the outcropping. The Coyote sighs with relief, but soon spots he is defying gravity and is then subject to it! 7\\\\. Again attempting to give semi-aerial chase, the Coyote retracts a massive spring attached to a cliff face and sits in it, tentatively letting go of his grip on the ground as the Road Runner passes on the left. But instead of launching at the bird, he simply gets caught inside the spring as it extends itself outwards. 8\\\\. Another ACME product (Dehydrated Boulders) takes the scene. Wile E. picks up one of them, places a drop of water on it (thus hydrating it), and attempts to throw it off the cliff towards the Road Runner below, but instead, the boulder expands first and crushes him. 9\\\\. In a final attempt to outrun and flatten the Road Runner, the Coyote constructs an outboard steam roller. When he turns it on, it rolls away from him and down the road. The steam roller soon encounters the Road Runner, who reverses direction and runs away. Wile E. continues to chase after his creation, while in what appears to be a convenient Deus ex machina, a fork comes up ahead with a sign stating: In case of steam roller use Detour. The Road Runner takes the detour and zooms into a miniature \\"escape tunnel\\", which was actually a cannon trap, with the coyote in hot pursuit. Wile E. leaps behind the cannon, lights the fuse and sits down, tired but satisfied. The fuse smokes, but the cannon doesn't fire. Confused, Wile E. looks inside the cannon and sees a white light coming out, accompanied by railroad noises. Seeing no danger, he laughs and looks inside again, but the cannon fires, with the Road Runner riding on top of the cannonball. The Road Runner waves at the now injured Coyote as he walks away, only for his own steamroller to come rolling towards him. Wile E. holds up a sign saying: \\"This is the end\\" just as the steam roller flattens him. Availability *Laserdisc: Road Runner Vs. Wile E.

Merrie Melodies series directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on September 14, 1957, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot left The pair zooms into view and begin to chase, freezing momentarily for the credits and Latin names to be shown: COYOTE: Famishus Vulgaris and ROAD-RUNNER: Birdibus Zippibus. From here, the Road Runner speeds off, leaving the coyote to fall on the ground. Wile E. recovers quickly, kicks up some dust, and begins to chase the Road Runner; the bird, though, leaves so much dust in the road that his pursuer cannot see ahead. Eventually, except for his ears, the coyote is completely enclosed in the dust. The Road Runner pulls next to the coyote and beeps, alerting Wile E. to his surroundings. The coyote's expression becomes foreboding, and the camera cuts out to show both apparently suspended in midair. As the dust clears, the coyote pokes his hands through the bottom of the cloud, and then looks down to see nothing but air below him. The dust completely clears, showing that the Road Runner is perched on the edge of a cliff and the coyote on the wrong side of him, and gravity then turns on. Determined not to let this happen again, Wile E. climbs up a very high escarpment and surveys his surroundings for the Road Runner...who happens to have pulled up right behind him and now beeps such that the coyote falls back down. The camera zooms in on an obviously miffed Wile E. as he falls to the ground again. Dusting himself off, the coyote gets up and walks out onto the road until the Road Runner beeps a second time and sends his rival directly into a low-slung rock plateau. 1\\\\. As he hasn't studied it enough, Wile E. follows the instructions of THE ART OF ROAD-RUNNER TRAPPING: # Dig hole in road # Camouflage hole # Wait patiently # Eat Road Runner However, he never gets past the first step, as his jackhammer vibrates enough to pull the coyote into the hole. When the power cord stretches enough to unplug the jackhammer, the coyote climbs out and finds himself vibrating sporadically. Wile E. walks over to the book and prepares to tear it in half, but one of the vibrations does the job for him. 2\\\\. Still trying to halt the Road Runner, Wile E. builds a brick wall (with one more vibration for good measure) on the mountain roads and waits. Soon, he hears the Road Runner braking in front of the wall. When his ears recover from the sonic assault and the dust cloud settles, he quizzically looks around the corner of the wall to see his own rear end. Wile E. makes random movements, imitated by his rear, while looking behind and ahead of him, and finally determines that this is a duplicate of himself and rolls dynamite under his own rear. The firework promptly explodes, and Wile E. laughs until he realizes his own tail is aflame, he leaps directly into the air in pain and falls down to the ground. 3\\\\. Wile E. sets up the first of two bird seed traps with a plate of bird seed, then takes off into the distance with a long string attached to the cork of a 1/5 bottle of \\"Acme Bumblebees\\" which is tied to a cactus arm above the plate. Road Runner approaches the plate and starts eating the seed, prompting Coyote to pull the cork. The huge swarm of bees burst out of the bottle, but instead of attacking the munching Road Runner it zooms into the distance towards Wile E. and repeatedly stings him. 4\\\\. For his second bird seed trap, Wile E. plans on squashing the bird with an anvil from high above a wooden plank. Predictably, the combined weight of Coyote and anvil causes the plank to snap in two when he walks on it. Road Runner easily dodges the falling anvil by sidestepping it, the plank halves fall on top of the resulting crater to create a convenient bridge back to the feast. 5\\\\. Having had enough of the simple traps, Wile E. builds a lengthy steep ramp and lights a bomb intended for the Road Runner at the ramp's bottom. All that effort is for nothing as the bomb instantly explodes upon lighting (even though the fuse is one foot long!) 6\\\\. Coyote now prepares a giant catapult in the road, but the boulder is too heavy for the catapult to sling at the passing Road Runner and it flattens its owner. 7\\\\. Finally, Wile E. hopes to shoot the Road Runner with a harpoon gun. The rope, however, catches one of Coyote's feet and drags his rear over a cactus and under several rocks, then hurtles him into open space. Wile E. sees the fix he is in and recovers in time to grab the very end of the rope. Unfortunately, the rope continues into a very thin pipe, then out onto the road and directly into a chicken race with a truck. Wile E. smashes directly through the truck, and then the spear finally impales a rock face, but this leads to the coyote being swung down into the path of a train and bumped all the way up to the edge of a precipice. The Road Runner pulls up directly behind the ragged, exhausted, gasping, and sobbing Coyote, but instead of beeping (which would possibly drive his opponent insane with more gravity-induced humiliation), he shows a soft side by holding up a sign saying: \\"I just don't have the heart.\\" As Road Runner dashes back the way he came, the sign changes to \\"'Bye!\\" Music The music is Dance of the Comedians from The Bartered Bride by Bedrich Smetana.15 Pieces of Classical Music That Showed Up in 'Looney Tunes', Mental Floss, July 31, 2015 See also * Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1950‚Äì1959) References External links  * Category:1957 films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:1957 animated films Category:Wile E.

The teams played at Holcomb Park. The first professional night baseball game was played at Holcomb Park when the Demons played at home on May 2, 1930.http://www.digitalballparks.com/Western/Holcomb_640_10.html Demons' Seasons 1925 In 1925 the Des Moines Boosters of the Western League became the Des Moines Demons. The club from Des Moines, Iowa broke in in fine form, winning the pennant with a 98‚Äì70 record, one game ahead of the Denver Bears. The Demons had six representatives on the All-Star team: First baseman Charles Stuvengen collected 229 hits, 18 of which were triples, to complement a .349, which was fifth in the Western League. Outfielder Sam Langford hit .339 with a league leading 160 runs. Outfielder Pug Griffin hit .320 with 23 home runs, catcher Homer Haworth hit .295, pitcher Herm Holshouser posted a record of 19‚Äì8 and pitcher Claude Thomas went 19‚Äì6. Leo Moon went 22‚Äì13 with 127 strikeouts on the season and tied for third in the league in wins and strikeouts. Left off of the All-Star team was the most productive hitter in the Triple Crown categories, Dutch Wetzel, who batted .353 and was second in the league with 32 homers. 1926 The Demons repeated as champions in 1926, winning another close race. Their 99‚Äì64 record gave them fewer wins than the Oklahoma City Indians, though they finished with two fewer losses and a half- game margin of victory overall. Oklahoma City claimed that other clubs (the Wichita Izzies, Lincoln Links and Tulsa Oilers) threw games to Des Moines but Western League president Mike Sexton cleared all involved parties. Des Moines lost a Mid-Western Championship to the Three-I League champion Springfield Senators team by a three games to one margin. The Demons had been led by Moon (an All-Star with a 24‚Äì8 record) and Pat Malone (28‚Äì13, second in the league in wins and first with 190 strikeouts) on the mound and Wetzel (.352 batting average, 18 home runs, sixth in average and tied for third with 394 total bases) and Griffin (an All-Star again with a .345 average and 18 homers). 40-year-old player-manager Shano Collins batted .315 with 14 home runs. 1927 Collins tied for the team lead with 11 home runs and hit .331 at age 41 in 1927 but the team fell to third at 82‚Äì72. Langford returned and led the league in hitting (.409), triples (28) and steals (31, tied for the lead with Wilbur Swansboro). He was tied for fourth in doubles (47), second in hits (250) and fourth in total bases (377). Joining him on the All-Star team were C Joe Sprinz who batted .314, utility man Al Van Camp who hit .309 with 11 home runs and pitcher Fred Ortman who went 21‚Äì11. Claude Davenport, who went 21‚Äì10, and Ortman tied for second in the league in wins; Davenport was also second in innings worked at 289. 1928 The bottom fell out for Des Moines in 1928 as they finished last in the first half (28‚Äì50) and last overall (62‚Äì98). The one bright spot was Van Camp's hitting, as he was fifth in the league with 19 triples, hit .351 and led the club with 15 homers. Three pitchers lost 16 or more games. 1929 The next year brought a slight improvement to 72‚Äì86 and 7th place in the 8-team Western League. A player named Circle, whose full name is unknown, hit 26 homers, which was fifth in the Western League. 1930 The 1930 campaign saw Des Moines return to the first division with a 77‚Äì71 record and fourth-place finish. Van Camp was fourth in the circuit with a .344 average and fifth with 18 homers. All-Stars were first baseman Jim Oglesby who hit .308 with 100 RBI, outfielder Stan Keyes who hit .340 with 35 HR, 358 total bases and 140 RBI was an All-Star as well. He was 6th in average, first in homers, RBI and total bases, fifth in runs with 123 and he tied for third in the league with 18 triples. Pitcher Bud Tinning, who went 16‚Äì11 with a 4.39 ERA, was an All-Star as well. 1931 Des Moines duked it out with the Wichita Aviators throughout the 1931 season. The Demons went 39‚Äì26 to finish second in the first half, three games behind Wichita, then won 55 of 80 second-half contests to finish six and a half games ahead of the Aviators. In the championship, the Demons won four of six games. All three 1930 All-Stars returned and again made the All-Star team ‚Äì Oglesby hit .341 which was 5th in the league to go along with 119 runs, 106 RBI, 200 hits (second-most) and 278 total bases (fifth); Tinning went 24‚Äì2 with a league-leading 3.11 ERA and was second in wins and first in winning percentage; Keyes won the Triple crown with a .369 average, 38 homers and 160 RBI, which were 22 more than anyone else. He also led with 401 total bases (111 more than the next player) and 203 hits. Joining them as All-Stars were outfielder Mike Kreevich who hit .329, and P Jack Knight who went 17‚Äì7 with a 3.30 ERA, which ranked second in the league. Jim Grant went 12‚Äì11 with a 3.48 ERA, the fifth-best mark, while Johnny Niggeling was 17‚Äì12 with a 3.65 ERA. 1932 The 1932 Demons finished third in the first half (36‚Äì30) but skidded down to 35‚Äì42 in the concluding segment of the season. Oglesby made his third All-Star team in a row and finished fifth in the league with 19 triples. Jim hit .385 with nine homers and 86 RBI. 1933 Des Moines won the most games in the Western League in 1933 at 81‚Äì47 but finished one and a half games behind the leader in both halves of the season. All-Star outfielder Leo Ogorek, who hit .321, led the league with 60 stolen bases and was fourth with 108 runs scored. Pitcher Al Gizelbach went 18‚Äì10, placing him fifth in wins, fourth in winning percentage and third with 203 strikeouts. Roy Hudson, who hit .348 with 16 homers and Mort Cooper, who went 7‚Äì5 both split the season between Des Moines and the Muskogee Oilers. 1934 An unusual situation occurred in 1934 when Des Moines, the St. Joseph Saints and Sioux City Cowboys all posted identical 36‚Äì23 first-half records and none won the second half (Des Moines was 32‚Äì33, behind St. Joseph and ahead of Sioux City). A four-team playoff resulted with Des Moines facing the second-half champion Davenport Blue Sox while the Saints and Cowboys squared off. Davenport beat the Demons three games to one to advance to the finals. Ogorek, who hit .316, again stole the most bases with 38, tied for the hit lead (164, also a 3-way tie) and was tied for second with 108 runs. Hudson hit .318 and led the loop with 94 RBI and Fabian Gaffke hit .311 and was second with 93 RBI, tied for fourth with 163 hits, second with 17 triples, tied for fourth with 15 homers and first with 269 total bases. 1935 The Western League eliminated the split-season format in 1935 and the Demons finished third at 58‚Äì55. In the playoffs they were swept in three games by the Saints. Ogorek hit .317 and was among the leaders in outfield fielding percentage (.984, third-best), steals (25, 2 behind the leader), hits (144, third-best) and runs (92, one behind the leader) while August Luther, who hit .306, was third in homers at 15 and second with 14 triples. Claude Passeau was the staff ace at 20‚Äì11 and led the Western League in wins, strikeouts (239) and innings hurled (244). 1936 The 1936 edition of the Des Moines Demons went 33‚Äì33 to finish fifth in the first half of the revived split-season system. They were 31‚Äì31 and third in the second half in the six-team Western League. All-Stars were pitcher Hal Turpin who went 20‚Äì10 with a 2.74 ERA, centerfielder Jim Asbell who hit .284 and catcher Hack Wilson (not the Hall of Fame player), who hit .267. Asbell tied for fourth with 13 homers. Keyes returned to blast 20 homers (second-best in the league) with 233 total bases, which was fourth best. Van Camp came back with 148 hits (fifth in the league) and tied for the league lead with 14 triples. Turpin led the league in complete games (28) and wins, was second in innings (259), third in ERA and fifth with 124 strikeouts. Julio Bonnetti, who went 14‚Äì13 with a 2.56 ERA had the best ERA in the Western League that year. 1937 In 1937 Des Moines went 32‚Äì31 to finish second in the first half then went 25‚Äì31 in the second half as the league was crumbling. All-Stars were catcher Bus Payton who hit .276, utility man Walt Menke who hit .293 and southpaw pitcher Art McDougall who went 16‚Äì11 with a 4.02 ERA. McDougall led the Western League in complete games (24) and innings (233) and was third in wins while teammate Gil Gebo (11‚Äì15, 4.63) was fourth in innings (216), games pitched (36) and losses. Henry Mart√≠nez hit just .216 but led the team in homers (12, which ranked fifth in the Western League) and steals (28, which was third most). He struck out the most (107 times) as well. Bob Allaire hit 2.84 and was among the leaders in walks (95, tied for second) and runs (94, fourth-most) while leading with 34 steals. Harry Hughes, who hit .303, drew 109 walks, the most in the circuit. The Demons were affiliated with the St. Louis Browns in 1937. The end of the Demons After the Western League collapsed following the 1937 season, Des Moines was without baseball for its longest stretch in the 20th century as the professional game did not return until 1947 with the Des Moines Bruins . The rebirth of the Demons: 1959‚Äì1961 In 1959, the Demons name was revived after 21 years of non-usage. The new Des Moines Demons were a Philadelphia Phillies farm club in the Three-I League. Managed by Chuck Kress, they finished second in the first half (38‚Äì26) then won the second-half pennant (40‚Äì29) before falling to the first- half champion Green Bay Bluejays in the championship three games to one. Cal Emery hit .323 and led the league with 281 total bases, 27 homers and 129 RBI. In 1960, Andy Seminick took over as manager and the Demons went 64‚Äì74, tied for last in the Three-I. Jerry Reimer hit .331 with 18 home runs and led the league with 179 hits and 294 total bases. Ray Culp went 6‚Äì7 and had a 6.59 ERA, not indicative of his future big-league performance. The final year was a poor one. Kress was managing again and Des Moines finished last ‚Äì by a wide margin, with a pitiful 37‚Äì93 record. They were so bad every other team in the Three-I League's final season of existence finished .500 or better. Five pitchers lost in double digits while no one won more than six contests. Dick Haines led the league with a .355 average while future big-leaguer Pat Corrales batted .309. The Demons name has not been used since that time by the Des Moines teams ‚Äì when organized baseball returned to the city in 1969 the club was called the Iowa Oaks.

In jurisdictions such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Nova Scotia, it is a defined legal term. Some jurisdictions, such as Virginia, may use the term adjacent landowner, while others, such as California, use the term adjoining landowner, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines rights of contiguous property owners (CPO). In land use regulations, concerns of an abutter may be given special attention, being the one most likely to suffer specific harm from a hasty, uninformed decision. For example, a developer requesting a subdivision may be required to notify (or pay to notify) all abutters of the proposal and invite them to a public hearing. Regulations may also provide an abutter with the right to be heard at the hearing, unlike others who must request permission to be heard, at the discretion of the board. In the spirit of land use politics, even the unified voices of the concerned abutters may sound only faintly against the machinery of \\"progress\\" or well-funded special interests. However, the courts will objectively consider a proper case brought by an abutter whose rights have been arguably under-appreciated. Generally, the more abutters interested in a project, the more likely someone will object to it. Some regulations otherwise expand or limit the participation of local owners, as where notice may be required for \\"anyone whose property is within 200 feet of any point of the parcel under consideration.\\" Another expansive definition would include those whose properties are across a public way or flowing waterway, where the parcels do not actually touch. Contrarily, regulations may define \\"abutter\\" to include only those people who hold record title to an adjacent parcel, thus undermining the rights of tenants, associations and partial owners (e.g., mineral rights and easement owners) to be notified, let alone heard on a proposal. This would also eliminate participation of owners of unrecorded title, such as adverse possession or those who have simply failed to record a deed or settle an estate involving the adjacent property.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on April 12, 1958, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Eddie Selzer, who produced all of Warner Bros. cartoons since September 1944, retired in 1958. Whoa, Be-Gone! was the final cartoon he produced. John W. Burton took over after this release. Plot Introduction: The Road Runner is chased down a roadway by Wile E. Coyote on a rocket, and the rocket's exhaust repeatedly runs into the camera during the chase, allowing the title cards to be shown. The chase begins in full force, and the Coyote gains on the Road Runner, leans off the rocket slightly, and prepares to sink his utensils into the Road Runner. Then the cartoon pauses for a red arrow and Wile E.'s Latin name (Famishius Vulgaris Ingeniusi), and then for another red arrow and the Road Runner's Latin name (Birdius High- Ballius). The chase continues down the road as Wile E. prepares to make his move, but before he can deliver the final blow, he hits his head on a tunnel arch as the Road Runner goes through it. The Road Runner and the rocket come out the other end; the bird escapes and the rocket (gets turned around) returns toward its owner. Wile E. recovers from the jar and climbs down, but soon returns upwards when he sees the rocket coming at him. He sighs with relief and dismounts the arch, but ironically, is hit by an ACME truck. Wile E. is pacing around a mountaintop when he runs directly into the Road Runner, who beeps and causes Wile E.'s head to retract after being scared into a rock ceiling. The Coyote chases after the bird through a cloud of dust, but only manages to throw himself into thin air. The Road Runner alerts the Coyote, who promptly falls into the canyon with an angry arm-folded glare. He manages to climb back up the mountain again, but no sooner does he do so than the Road Runner, on another plateau, beeps again. 1\\\\. The Coyote uses a see-saw and rock to attempt to launch himself towards the Road Runner, but the rock breaks through the cliff's edge, and the Coyote slides from the top of the board down and through the hole. He falls into almost the same spot as the first time, creating a cross of coyote imprints in the ground. 2\\\\. The Coyote patches up a trampoline on the desert ground and then proceeds to man a sniper rifle. He hears the Road Runner's beep, but doesn't see him approaching. He turns around to find the bird is actually perched 20 feet behind him. So he turns the rifle around, but there's no space on the other side. Wile E. falls off the cliff again, smiling because he thinks the trampoline will save him. Not so... it turns out that the trampoline is too fragile to be bounced on, so he busts directly through it. 3\\\\. The Coyote has now ordered a giant rubber band and ties it around two rocks, hoping to trap the Road Runner. However, it is so elastic that it pulls the two rocks together while Wile E. is still in between them. 4\\\\. Now, Wile E. lights a bunch of fireworks inside a barrel and bungee- swings the barrel out into open space above the road which the Road Runner is about to pass. But the very edge of the rock that Wile E. is standing on breaks off, causing the Coyote to swing directly below the barrel. As the rope begins to snap, Wile E. climbs up to escape the calamity, but fails to make it off in time. He falls to the ground and is smashed by the barrel. Now, the Coyote has to escape his own security measure, a nailed-shut lid. Wile E. manages to hammer off all the nails and climb out of the barrel, then hide and wait for the explosion. However, he forgot to check the lid - the fireworks are on the lid, which Wile E. is still wearing! 5\\\\. Next, Wile E. builds a high wire structure and dons a wheel-head. He struggles to get himself balanced upside-down on top of the wire (even after the Road Runner is long gone), and when he finally is able to let go of the rock, the wire (predictably) snaps, sending Wile E. crashing headfirst into the ground. Then, the wire drapes over a power line while one end falls into the Coyote's hole, resulting in the Coyote incurring a violent electrical shock. 6\\\\. The Coyote now attaches TNT to the bottom of a high bridge as he waits on the ground with the controller. The Road Runner moves towards the intended target, but stops short of the bridge. The bridge detonates and the concrete falls directly upon the poor Coyote. 7\\\\. Wile E.'s last plan is to use ACME Tornado Seeds to trap the Road Runner. Wile E. tests them by placing one next to a small cactus and shooting the requisite blast of water at it. The seed morphs into a tornado and sucks up the cacti as planned. Therefore, Wile E. drops a handful of seeds into the road just before the Road Runner turns up. Wile E. fires his pistol, but instead of firing on the seeds on the road to suck up the Road Runner, it malfunctions and all the water comes out the bottom of the pistol and when it lands on the jar of tornado seeds near Wile E., it soaks all of them instead which means the jar grows big and makes it cold and then it starts to spin and all the seven words of ‚ÄúOne thousand tornado seeds.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on October 11, 1958, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot The Coyote, on a cliff, drops a washtub on the Road Runner on the road below, jumps on it and puts a stick of dynamite underneath it. The Road Runner zips up to him. The Coyote goes under the washtub to investigate why the bird isn't there and the dynamite blows up, encasing the Coyote in a tube made from the washtub. The Coyote hides around a corner to bash the Road Runner with a sledgehammer. But the hammer falls off and the stick bashes the Coyote and chases him into the distance. Birdseed is place on some railroad tracks but a train runs down the Coyote before he can get off the railroad. Attached to a green balloon, the Coyote carrying a harpoon jumps off a cliff, tied to a rope. He misses the Road Runner, but the force carries him into a storm cloud. The harpoon attracts lightning which zaps the Coyote and dissolves the rope, causing him to fall. Coyote unrolls a bundle of dynamite from its wires to a short underpass beneath the road. Coyote heads back to his hiding spot, oblivious that the wires and dynamite are rolling back to him and the detonator. Thus, one push of the plunger blows him up. Using a rope and a pulley, the Coyote raises a baby grand piano high above the road. As the Road Runner passes, the Coyote lets go of the rope, which sticks in the pulley. The Coyote jumps on top of the piano, which loosens the rope and causes the piano - and the Coyote - to drop to the ground. Dazed, the Coyote opens his mouth to reveal that the piano keys are now his teeth; he plays \\"Taps\\" on them briefly before passing out. An elaborate Rube Goldberg-type gag ends the cartoon. A target and birdseed is placed on the road. Road Runner zips by and eats the seeds. The Coyote uses a tiny slingshot to knock loose a stick holding up a watering can suspended on a wooden yardarm. The can tips and water pours onto a plant which has a wooden match attached to it. The plant grows and the match strikes against a rock and lights a stick of dynamite. On top of the dynamite is a boot with a brick in it. The blast sends the boot on top of a teeter board, which rises and releases a mouse (with an extended tail) in a cage at the other end. The mouse runs to grab a piece of cheese on a scale. A weight on the other end of the scale falls, pulling the trigger on a rifle attached to a cliff. A bullet from the rifle ricochets off two metal bullseyes and knocks down an upright cannon. The wick on the cannon is lit by a nearby candle, which fires a cannonball that goes through two funnels and plummets on top of the unsuspecting Coyote instead of the curious Road Runner. After Coyote is bashed into the ground, \\"The End\\" appears on the cannonball. The title is a pun on the title Hook, Line and Sinker. Availability *VHS- Wile. E. Coyote Vs.

This defensive system was part of the northernmost section of the Hindenburg Line, a vast German defensive system that ran through northeastern France. It was attacked and captured by Canadian and British troops in the closing months of the war as part of Canada's Hundred Days of successful offensive campaigning that helped end the war. Description Western front 1917 The Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Line ran between the French cities of Drocourt and Qu√©ant and was part of a defensive system that ran from a point within the Hindenburg Line, eleven miles west of Cambrai, northward to within seven miles west of Douai and terminated along the front east of Armenti√®res. The Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Line was a system in depth and incorporated a number of mutually supporting lines of defence. The system consisted of a front line system and a support line system, each consisting of two lines of trenches. The system incorporated numerous fortifications including concrete bunkers, machine gun posts and heavy belts of barbed wire. Capture At 5:00 a.m. in the morning on 2 September 1918, Canadian and British forces attacked the Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Line supported by tanks and aircraft.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on December 6, 1958, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. The title is a pun on the phrase \\"Hip Hip Hooray!!\\" Plot The Road Runner zooms into view, labeled \\"Digoutius- unbelievablii\\", and then moves away to escape Wile E. Coyote, labeled \\"Eatius- slobbius\\" (no doubt due to Wile's protruding tongue at this time). Eventually, the chase leads to a 3-way Y fork, leaving the coyote confused as to which way his enemy went. The bird answers for him by pulling up behind him and beeping, giving the coyote a real headache on the rocks above. However, before he can chase the Road Runner in that direction, the bird pulls behind him a second time. Wile instantly suspects the situation, and peeks through his legs, but this only leads to him bumping his head on the ground when the Road Runner beeps. The chase now begins in full force, ending when the Road Runner barely escapes the coyote's grip and sets a bridge on fire due to his speed. Wile E. is left bemused at the bird's burst of speed, gesturing the incident, and falls through the bridge and down to the ground. After hitting the ground, Wile E. comes up with an idea or two on how to catch the Road Runner. 1\\\\. While the Road Runner is munching on desert plants, his opponent attempts to drop a hand grenade on him. However, the grenade, by pure misfortune, drops onto a power line and is hoisted directly back to its owner, instantly wiping the laugh off his face. The grenade explodes, and the unhappy Coyote lets go of the stop perforce. This, however, causes a second grenade to be thrown up to Wile E. and explode on him as well. Later on, Wile E. paces the cliff he's still on and it isn't until he stops near the edge that he comes up with a new plan. 2\\\\. Wile E. starts his painful trapeze act and ends up getting scraped on the ground, hitting the top of a tunnel and hit by the face by an ACME truck. 3\\\\. Hoping to ambush the Road Runner, Wile E. loads a firework into a slingshot and prepares to fire it at the Road Runner, but it explodes on him first. 4\\\\. Having mined the road with a giant firework, the coyote has logistical problems with the match. His first attempts has the match burn his face. Finally he is \\"gratefully\\" helped out by the Road Runner, who gives the coyote a lit match. As soon as Wile lights the fuse, the Road Runner disappears, causing the coyote to chase after him. The Road Runner then stops next to the firework, signals for the coyote to stop, and points at the sizzling firework before he dodges the explosion, leaving Wile to take the entire blast. 5\\\\. To hopefully squash the Road Runner, the coyote flips a rock across a high outcropping, rather predictably leading to the entire outcropping breaking off. Wile continues to flip the rock over, and it is only when the rock ends up in the air above him that he realizes what is happening. He runs through the air to avoid being squashed directly by the rock, and the piece of outcropping lands on a rock to create a see-saw. Wile E. lands on the right end, while the rock smashes onto the left end and sends the coyote up into a rock face, then down onto the see-saw again before he flips the rock onto himself. 6\\\\. With his own special motorboat, it looks good for Wile E. Coyote, tearing apart the river as he attempts to catch the Road Runner on the riverbank. However, when he climbs out to attempt to grab his opponent, he sees that he is going over a waterfall and only barely steers himself back in the other direction. With relief, the coyote relaxes until he ends up falling off a second waterfall in the opposite direction. 7\\\\. With stealth exhausted, the coyote tries to use raw speed to catch the Road Runner and tests his new high-speed tonic (containing \\"Vitamins R, P, & M\\", no less) on an unsuspecting mouse. The mouse rattles around as a \\"warm-up\\", then darts across the desert at an impossible speed, and runs up and down a rock arch to return to his tester. Happy with this development, Wile E. releases the mouse, still suffering the effects of RPM, into his hole, and then drinks the entire bottle of it himself. After the warm-up period, Wile begins the chase and quickly begins to erase the Road Runner's considerable head start. However, just as it is getting down to the wire, the Road Runner sidesteps and trips the coyote, making him roll out of control into a construction zone and then into a dynamite shed, along with a kerosene lamp, which explodes everything inside. The small silo top is transformed into a rocket, which is fired through the clouds with its rider and goes off, creating fireworks in the starry night sky, much to Road Runner's amusement.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on May 9, 1959, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot Wile E. Coyote (Famishius Famishius) attempts several ways to get the Roadrunner (Super-Sonicus-Tastius). The Roadrunner reaches two outcroppings. When Wile E. tries it, the end of said outcropping comes off. Just when he thinks he is about to suffer gravity yet again, Wile. E is saved by a tree branch. He tries to go on the plateau nearby, only for the plateau to fall to a river. A fish nearby is spooked when Wile E. gets his newest scheme. 1\\\\. The Coyote races after the Roadrunner with his new roller skates. When the Roadrunner tries to trip the Coyote, Wile E., in time, leaps in the air and sticks his tongue out at the bird, but little does he know, he is about to fall of a cliff yet again! He ends up in the ground, with only his feet sticking out, as the wheels fall off one of the skates. 2\\\\. After getting an explosive camera kit, Wile E. prepares for his newest deception. The Roadrunner is intrigued by the signs. When the Roadrunner gets ready for his picture, the gun goes off on the Coyote. As the Roadrunner speeds away, the dazed Wile E. sees the one flaw of his attempt: he forgot to take off the lens cap that was on the entire time. 3\\\\. As the Roadrunner taunts the Coyote from above, Wile E. prepares a trampoline. However, when he jumps, he gets trapped inside like a burlap sack. 4\\\\. Now armed with a crossbow and dynamite, Wile E. prepares for his plan. However, when he lights the fuse and the Roadrunner comes, the crossbow fires yet the dynamite is left behind to blow him up. 5\\\\. Now resorting to his best friend Acme, Wile E. receives a jet propelled pogo stick. However, when the Coyote prepares the pogo stick, it propels him to the cliff behind him. Down he goes again. 6\\\\. Using railroad deception again, Wile E. hammers a crossing sign, accompanied by tracks set up and a record player with Hi-Fi railroad crossing sounds playing. When the Roadrunner stops, the Coyote tries to catch the bird, only to be run over by an actual train. 7\\\\. Having almost blown his top with simple traps, Wile E. uses 12 bombs down an extremely long slide (identical to the one he had tried to use in Zoom and Bored). He lifts the slide door to release the bombs from their bin, but none of them come out. He tries shaking the bin moderately, then violently. After pondering, he also tries to prise them out, but when he tries to stomp on them, Boom! A dazed Wile E. slides down, and the Roadrunner passes over him to add insult to injury. 8\\\\. Wile E. receives another of Acme's products, a jet propelled unicycle. When the Coyote lights the fuse, he is dragged away. Wile E. tries to balance himself and succeeds. As he passes the Roadrunner, he tries to get him, but didn't move when he seemed to speed off. Wile E. then falls off a cliff and the resulting cloud of smoke has the words \\"The End\\" on it.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on October 10, 1959, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot Wile E. is shown brandishing scissors on top of a high-rise tree branch, ready to cut the rope and drop a rock onto the passing Road Runner. The rock displays the title, and when it falls to the ground and barely misses, the credits are shown in the dust. Director Chuck Jones' credit is displayed upon a rocket that the coyote plans to ride. The letters in Jones' name and his director credit fall off the rocket as it takes off. The rocket is paused in mid-flight to show the coyote's Latinesque name: Hardheadipus Oedipus. The Road Runner is still leading the way, and his flight is paused to show his Latinesque name: Batoutahelius. The chase goes well for Wile E., until the rocket slams into a low plateau. Luckily enough, the coyote can still continue the air chase. He almost catches the Road Runner, but slams his head on a rock arch before he can pounce. Wile E., looking like a sunflower, looks at the camera and then trudges off. 1\\\\. Hoping for better luck this time, Wile E. takes delivery of an ACME giant elastic rubber band and attempts to launch himself off a slingshot, but only succeeds in going about 2 feet before face planting. The coyote poses innocently on a rock perch until the Road Runner passes by below, and soon comes up with his next plan. 2\\\\. Again hoping for a big smash, he flips a clam-shaped rock across a thin outcropping, but when Wile E. finally pushes it over the edge, it flips over and the end attaches itself to the precipice. Wile E. attempts to push it down, and then stomps on and off it six times, with no result. Then, he jumps fully on and puts his whole might onto the rock, and succeeds. He continues to stomp on the rock until he realizes he's falling. He looks down and sees the ground, then attempts to jump off the rock. However, all that does is turn the rock in circles. Not giving up, Wile E. thus manages to slow the rock down, but the end result is the rock drilling through a large rock face and into a train tunnel, where the coyote is hit and thrown all the way back out. A small piece of the rock plants him on the ground neatly, and a relieved Wile E. steps off, but finds himself continuing to rotate periodically like the McKimson-created character Tasmanian Devil as he walks. 3\\\\. The camera shows an order form for an extremely large railroad construction job that Wile E. has done to attempt to ensnare his nemesis. Now, the camera zooms across the landscape to show the extremely long railroad, and that the coyote has put himself into a rocket sled to glide across the tracks. The first turn is going from almost straight down to about 60 degrees downwards; however, the sled breaks directly through the mounted railroad and face plants on the ground. 4\\\\. Since physics never works for the coyote, he uses it as a weapon by baiting the Road Runner's bird seed with iron pellets and mounting a bomb and a magnet on an old-fashioned clamp-on roller skate; however, the magnetic force is strong enough to separate the skate into two pieces, leaving the bomb close to the coyote. A puzzled Wile E. pokes his head up from his hiding place and is obliterated by the bomb. 5\\\\. Not having learned from the last physics outing, Wile E. drops a bowling ball through a pipe section, trying to squash his rival. It misses the Road Runner, and the ball's weight causes it to bounce straight back up through the pipe and hit its owner in the face. Wile E. is thrown up into the air, and down through the pipe and onto the ground, followed by the bowling ball to add insult to injury. 6\\\\. With all the forces of nature against him, the coyote plugs himself into an ACME Indestructo Steel Ball to avoid them, and rolls himself off an escarpment. However, he narrowly misses his intended target (the Road Runner) and pitches himself onto a serac and into a dam. He rolls himself up out of the water, and then directly down a wall, over several rocks, and then back into the water. Wile E. finally pokes out of the ball to realize where he is going: off the edge again. He falls directly down the waterfall, into a mash of water, and finally out of the dam, but instead onto an old enemy: railroad tracks. He gets out, relieved, but soon gets back inside for shelter when he sees an approaching train, which hits the ball and sends it directly into an abandoned mine field. One explosion dents the ball and sends him back into the air, and then down to the same escarpment as before. The entire sequence repeats as the Road Runner approaches once again, and after Wile E. misses him for a second time, the Road Runner holds up a sign that says HERE WE GO AGAIN, beeps, and then dashes off into the distance as the cartoon irises out. The title is based on the song title \\"I'm Just Wild About Harry\\". The bird seed with iron pellets gag was reused in The Wild Chase.

In geometric topology, PDIFF, for piecewise differentiable, is the category of piecewise-smooth manifolds and piecewise-smooth maps between them. It properly contains DIFF (the category of smooth manifolds and smooth functions between them) and PL (the category of piecewise linear manifolds and piecewise linear maps between them), and the reason it is defined is to allow one to relate these two categories. Further, piecewise functions such as splines and polygonal chains are common in mathematics, and PDIFF provides a category for discussing them.  Motivation  PDIFF serves to relate DIFF and PL, and it is equivalent to PL. PDIFF is mostly a technical point: smooth maps are not piecewise linear (unless linear), and piecewise linear maps are not smooth (unless globally linear) ‚Äì the intersection is linear maps, or more precisely affine maps (because not based) ‚Äì so they cannot directly be related: they are separate generalizations of the notion of an affine map. However, while a smooth manifold is not a PL manifold, it carries a canonical PL structure ‚Äì it is uniquely triangularizable; conversely, not every PL manifold is smoothable. For a particular smooth manifold or smooth map between smooth manifolds, this can be shown by breaking up the manifold into small enough pieces, and then linearizing the manifold or map on each piece: for example, a circle in the plane can be approximated by a triangle, but not by a 2-gon, since this latter cannot be linearly embedded. This relation between Diff and PL requires choices, however, and is more naturally shown and understood by including both categories in a larger category, and then showing that the inclusion of PL is an equivalence: every smooth manifold and every PL manifold is a PDiff manifold. Thus, going from Diff to PDiff and PL to PDiff are natural ‚Äì they are just inclusion. The map PL to PDiff, while not an equality ‚Äì not every piecewise smooth function is piecewise linear ‚Äì is an equivalence: one can go backwards by linearize pieces. Thus it can for some purposes be inverted, or considered an isomorphism, which gives a map \\\\text{Diff} \\\\to \\\\text{PDiff} \\\\to \\\\text{PL}. These categories all sit inside TOP, the category of topological manifold and continuous maps between them. In summary, PDiff is more general than Diff because it allows pieces (corners), and one cannot in general smooth corners, while PL is no less general that PDiff because one can linearize pieces (more precisely, one may need to break them up into smaller pieces and then linearize, which is allowed in PDiff). History That every smooth (indeed, C1) manifold has a unique PL structure was originally proven in . A detailed expositionary proof is given in . The result is elementary and rather technical to prove in detail, so it is generally only sketched in modern texts, as in the brief proof outline given in .

He also spent one season with the Washington Redskins. He retired in 2000 after being released by the Chicago Bears in training camp that same year. Early years Mims attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, California. As a senior, he set the school single season records for sacks and tackles. However, he failed to meet the academic qualifications to attended an NCAA university. Therefore, he chose to attend Los Angeles Pierce College, then Los Angeles Southwest Junior College. After earning better grades, he was recruited by assistant coach A. J. Christoff to the University of Tennessee where he spent two seasons. While at Tennessee, he recorded 90 tackles and 9.5 sacks. In the October 18, 2010 issue of Sports Illustrated, former NFL agent Josh Luchs alleged that he paid Mims 'about $500 a month' during his last year at the University of Tennessee.

During his final years, Mims was unable to take care of himself and he lived on disability payments and avoided bill collectors. On October 15, 2008, Mims was found dead in his Los Angeles apartment by police officers conducting a welfare check. The cause of death was determined to be an enlarged heart. He weighed at the time of his death. A few years prior to his death, he had suffered a stroke. Mims is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).Chris Mims Personal life Mims had one son, Christopher Eddie Mims, Jr. Legal troubles During his playing career, Mims had numerous legal troubles. Among them were charges of assault, vandalism, and driving under the influence. He was taken to court more than 20 times for unpaid bills in San Diego County. All of which date to his National Football League (NFL) career. A career during which he earned almost $6 million. He is reported to have defaulted on a $243,750 house loan during the Chargers' Super Bowl season. He neglected bills for his Mercedes- Benz 600 SEL, attorneys' fees, carpet bills, liquor bills and, at times, child support. In 1995, he was cited by a Superior Court judge for not making monthly payments of $5,000 to a man whose windshield he smashed in a traffic dispute. In 1998, he was convicted of refusing to take a blood-alcohol test after being pulled over on suspicion of driving drunk. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge after he hit a man with a belt outside a Del Taco.

These generators have proven to be useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity for example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio in 50 or so homes. Even smaller turbines of 200‚Äì300 W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only one meter. Pico-hydro setups typically are run-of- stream, meaning that a reservoir of water is not created, only a small weir is common, pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before being exhausted back to the stream. Like other hydroelectric and renewable source power generation, pollution and consumption of fossil fuels is reduced, though there is still typically an environmental cost to the manufacture of the generator and distribution methods. Small- scale DIY hydroplants With a growing DIY-community and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly \\"green energy\\", some hobbyists have endeavored to build their own hydroelectric plants from old water mills, from kits, or from scratch. The DIY-community has used abandoned water mills to mount a waterwheel and electrical generating components. This approach has also been popularized in the TV-series It's Not Easy Being Green. These are usually smaller turbines of ~5 kW or less. Through the internet, the community is now able to obtain plans to construct DIY-water turbines, and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements. The DIY- hydroelectric plants are now being used both in developed countries and in developing countries, to power residences and small businesses. Two examples of pico hydro power can be found in the towns of Kithamba and Thimba in the Central Province of Kenya. These produce 1.1 kW and 2.2 kW, respectively. Local residents were trained to maintain the hydro schemes. The pico hydro sites in Kenya won Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy. Using a pumped- storage system of cisterns and small generators, pico hydro may also be effective for \\"closed loop\\" home systems. Manufacturers In Vietnam, several Chinese manufacturers have sold pico-powerplants at prices as low as $20‚Äì70 for a powerplant of 300‚Äì500 W. However, the devices sold are said to be low in quality and may damage connected equipment if connected improperly. Sam Redfield of the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group (AIDG) has developed a pico-hydro generator made from common PVC pipe and a modified Toyota alternator housed in a five gallon bucket. The generator was developed to provide power to communities without access to the electricity grid in developing countries. Envisioned as an energy source to charge cell phones, provide lighting and charge batteries, the generator is designed to be made by artisans with basic skills and can be built for less than $150.00. The Toyota alternator used in the generator is converted to a permanent magnet alternator allowing it to generate power at low RPMs. The Five Gallon Bucket Hydroelectric Generator was the subject of a work group at the 2008 International Development Design Summit (IDDS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the Summer of 2013, an energy project in Abra Malaga, Peru was completed using the bucket generator. A website has been put together as a forum for ideas and further iterations of the generator that includes a build manual. Common centrifugal water pumps, can be operated in reverse to act as turbines. While these machines rarely have optimum hydraulic characteristics when operated as turbines, their availability and low cost makes them attractive. Transmission distance If the power will be used more than 30 meters (100 feet) from the generator, then the transmission distance may be an important consideration. Many small systems use automotive alternators producing 12 VDC, and possibly charging a battery. For example, a 12 V system that produces 1 kW of power has a flow of 80 A and the wire size is 4-gauge. The purchase cost of two strands of wire 1000 feet long for this voltage and amperage was typically $2400(US) in 2015. To avoid such a large wire cost a higher voltage and lower current is required. If a 240 VAC alternator is used instead the flow is only 4 A over 1000' of 18 gauge wire costing $180(US). The cost of wire resulted in North America using 120/240 VAC after DC voltage lost the war of the currents in the late 1800s. Another approach to reduce wire costs is to have a 12 VDC alternator with a short high current connection to an inverter outputting 120 VAC or 240 VAC at a much lower current on a long length of thinner wire.

It is located in the municipality of Landgraaf, on the German border. Rimburg was a separate municipality until 1887, when it was merged with Ubach over Worms.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \\"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\\", KNAW, 2006. Rimburg is a village (consisting of the cores and Rimburg Broekhuizen) on the River Worm in eastern South Limburg. Rimburg is part of the municipality of Landgraaf. It is part of the former municipality Ubach over Worms. In the early 1980s the municipalities of Schaesberg, Ubach over Worms and Nieuwenhagen were collectively known as the SUN municipalities, until they merged to form the new municipality of Landgraaf.  History  Until 1886 Rimburg was an independent municipality; its territory extended to Brunssum. The glory, with aldermen, was after the arrival of the French at the end of the 18th century, as well Ubach over Worms, assigned to the Canton Rolduc. When the cantonal division was disbanded in 1800, the municipality Rimburg was formed from that part of the former glory, located on the left / west bank of the river Worm. The remaining part of the former glory became German territory. The municipality Rimburg had during its existence the same government organization as Nieuwenhagen, which therefore is referred to. The municipality was terminated by \\"Law of the 16th December 1886 to union of municipalities Rimburg and Ubach over Worms.\\" The effective date for termination was designated the day the board of the new municipality Ubach over Worms had its first meeting. That first meeting was held on March 15, 1887. The last council meeting of the municipality Rimburg took place on October 9, 1886.  World War II  Rimburg became an independent municipality once again during World War II. Rimburg was in the frontline and was the last part of South Limburg liberated on 2 October 1944. It played an important role in the encirclement of Aachen. During this assault the castle was heavily defended by the Germans. One part of the castle was destroyed along with many treasures. On the German side of the Worm, there still are many bunkers that were once part of the Siegfried Line.  Geography  The river Worm flows past Rimburg and forms the natural markings of the Dutch-German state border. In Germany, it is called the River Wurm. Across the Worm, on the territory of the German municipality √úbach-Palenberg, is the castle of Rimburg, which is still in aristocratic hands.  Sights  Sights in Rimburg include the castle, the water tower, a water mill on the bank of the Worm near the church, the church itself, and several historic farms. On the Street \\"Broekhuizenstraat\\", the foot of a Roman milestone can be found.

History, ensembles, touring, teachers  Lenny Seidman is a tabla player, composer and teacher based in Philadelphia. For the past 30 years, his creative output has centered around the application of tabla to a wide range of interdisciplinary and intercultural settings. The son of a cantor and choir leader, he graduated Temple University with a degree in accounting. Realizing that this was not his calling after a few years and after an equally discouraging stint in the army, he \\"dropped out\\" and began studying classical and jazz piano with aspirations of becoming a jazz pianist. Along the way, however, he experienced an epiphany in discovering Indian classical music and tabla in 1971. He immediately began studying tabla, first with Ishwarlal Misra followed by Chotelal Misra and Kiran Deshponde, all from Benares, India. Inspired by this rich, ancient musical culture and seeking deeper personal awareness of the world around him, he set off on several journeys to India, Nepal, Kashmir, Eastern and Western Europe, backpacking and hitchhiking with his tabla and quickly learning that music is the universal language no matter where he found himself. Playing tabla allowed him entry into many different communities even if he didn't speak the language. His first formal entry into the magical world of music was working with improvisational musicians and dancers in Philadelphia. He was hooked. By the 80s, feeling the need to dig deeper into Indian rhythms, Lenny began learning the South Indian rhythm system with carnatic violinist Adrian L‚ÄôArmand. At the same time, he had been expanding his creative vision by integrating analog electronic music (Serge Modular) with tabla and other percussion - composing and performing pieces for independent choreographers, dance companies and installation artists and for his own music ensembles, Lotus and Shamanistics, with such creative musicians including Jamaaladeen Tacuma, Ric Iannacone, Michael Daugherty and Toshi Makihara. Memorable events include week long solo performances at ARTPARK in Lewiston NY for an outdoor fabric installation in the woods by Elaine Crivelli, several performances in East and West Berlin with Group Motion Dance Theater Co. directed by Manfred and Brigitta Fischbeck and a collaboration with choreograper/dancer Benoit LaChambre at the Canada Dance Festival in Ottawa. He continued his tabla development with performances of North and South Indian classical music with L'Armand and with North Indian bansuri flutist, Paul John. In 1991, Lenny became a student of tabla maestro and composer, Zakir Hussain in California that permanently cemented his commitment exclusively to tabla as his life's work moving forward. He subsequently designed, coordinated and performed in two intensive residencies led by Zakir and kathak dancer/choreographer, Antonia Minnecola, that involved 20 culturally diverse traditional hand drummers and dancers. This experience helped launch Seidman into dedicating himself to focusing on creating his own projects that bring cultures together. A three-month residency in 1993 at the Headlands Center for the Arts in Sausalito, California provided Seidman a fertile cultural environment for continued study with Zakir, composing, collaborating with fellow residents and researching for what was to follow. In 1996, Spoken Hand Percussion Orchestra and the Lenny Seidman Tabla Choir were born. He was awarded a fellowship/residency at APPEX (Asian Pacific Performing Arts Exchange) hosted by UCLA in 1999, that monumentally expanding Lenny's aesthetic and world view. This intense six-week residency, curated and coordinated by Judy Mitoma, involved living, work-shopping and performing with a large group of traditional and contemporary drummers, choreographers, and theater artists from many Pacific Rim countries. The performances took place at UCLA and other venues in Los Angeles. Lenny was co-director with Daryl Burgee of Spoken Hand Percussion Orchestra, unifying the drumming traditions of North Indian tabla, Afro-Cuban bata, Afro-Brazilian samba, and West African djembe into its own unique voice. Spoken Hand performed and conducted workshops extensively in university, festival and theater settings nationally for twenty years. Among their many accomplishments was a collaboration in 2002 with Zakir Hussain and pioneer hip-hop choreographer Rennie Harris' Puremovement in \\"Flammable Contents\\". Shortly after, Spoken Hand released its first CD and followed up with their \\"Skins & Songs\\" CD, a collaboration with Philip Hamilton's \\"Voices,\\" with whom Lenny also performed in Poland. He completed a four-year international tour in 2007 with hip hop pioneer Rennie Harris' PureMovement epic piece, \\"Facing Mekka,\\" as a musical collaborator. Seidman is director of the Lenny Seidman Tabla Choir and is an original member of Atzilut, the Middle Eastern Jewish/Arabic music ensemble noted for their \\"Concerts for Peace\\" performed at the United Nations, throughout the U.S., and Europe. In other more recent projects, he was musical director and composer for Nadine Patterson's feature film, \\"Tango Macbeth\\" which screened internationally. He guest performed with the contemporary opera \\"Ghosts of Monticello\\" at Bucknell University in 2015 (Garrett Fisher (composer), Carmen Gillespie (librettist), and Emily Martin-Mobley (director)). In late 2015, he collaborated with butoh artist Michael Sakamoto with his tabla choir (Daniel Ando Scholnick and Mike Nevin) at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. By this time, Seidman had become hyper aware of the thread that was subconsciously weaving through his creative life over the past few decades - applying tabla to a multitude of collaborative inter cultural and interdisciplinary environments and reconciling all their inherent differences. The culmination of this formalized mission resulted in a 2017 project grant from Pew Center for Arts & Heritage to create and direct \\"ARC\\", a full length contemporary suite merging the drumming traditions of tabla and taiko with choreography and dance representing Asia Pacific, African diasporic, hip hop and Western post modern. With substantial additional support from the William J. Cooper Foundation, the world premier took place at Swarthmore College in October, 2018. The cast consisted of Joe Small, Kristy Oshiro, Isaku Kageyama, Laurel Jenkins, Ani Gavino, Orlando Hunter, Daniel Ando Scholnick, Jonathan Marmor, and Seidman. A month long artist retreat at the Millay Colony for the Arts in Austerlitz, NY provided him uninterrupted time to develop his vision and compose music for this project. Lenny had founded and coordinated several other ensembles along the way including the Shamanistics with Michael Daugherty and Ric Iannacone, and Splinter Group, a percussion/dance ensemble that included Rennie Harris, Roko Kawai, Grace Zarnoch-Green, Toshi Makihara, Joe Ruscitto and Branavan Ganesan. He has performed and/or recorded throughout the Americas, as well as abroad, with such music artists including Zakir Hussain, Kenny Endo, Simon Shaheen, Yacouba Sissoko; LL Cool J, Kenny Muhammad, I Dewa Puta Berata; Butch Morris, Yair Dalal, Kyaw Kyaw Naing, Elio Villafranca, Papo Vazquez, Adam Rudolph and poet Ursula Rucker. He has also collaborated with many choreographers including Cynthia Lee, Viji Rao, Helmut Gottschild, Christine Cox, Nina Martin, Myra Bazell, Eko Supriyanto, Cheng- Chieh Yu, Sen Hea Ha, Ananya Chatterjea, Kim Arrow, and Pallabi Chakrobarty. He was a guest artist at Swarthmore College Department of Music and Dance from 1998 to 2012 teaching tabla, collaborating with their gamelan orchestra and taiko ensemble, and the kathak dance classes. Lenny has given workshops nationally, teaches tabla and rhythm theory privately, and has been the World Music and Jazz curator at the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia since 1986 having programmed over 400 concerts, residencies and educational outreach activities. He continues to perform for South Asian community events. Grants, fellowships, commissions, residencies, awards Lenny's creative work has been supported by the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, Independence Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, Rockefeller Foundation's MAP Fund, William J. Cooper Foundation and Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. He was commissioned by Phrenic New Ballet to compose a new piece for choreographer Christine Cox's \\"Tabula Rasa,\\" and by Kim Arrow for his \\"Quasimodo in the Outback\\". He was awarded the APPEX Fellowship in 1999, a six-week inter-cultural residency at UCLA where he collaborated and lived with 30 performing artists from throughout Asia. He also was awarded a three-month residency at Headlands Center for the Arts in Sausalito, CA in 1993. Seidman completed a month-long artist retreat at The Millay Colony for the Arts in April 2017, and was awarded a project grant from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage to develop \\"ARC\\", a performance suite that brings together the drumming traditions of tabla and taiko along with the added dimension of dance.

Description It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub growing up to 6 m (rarely to 10 m) tall, often with a dense cluster of stems from its base. The bark is light brown, smooth, scaly, inner bark reddish purple. The branchlets are pubescent at first, later smooth, light orange brown, marked with occasional white dots, finally dark or reddish brown. The foliage buds are acute, slightly falcate, downy, light brown. The leaves are oval, long and broad, oblique at the base, acute or rounded at the apex, with a wavy-toothed or shallowly lobed margin, and a short, stout petiole long; the midrib is more or less hairy, stout, with six to seven pairs of primary veins. The young leaves open involute, covered with stellate rusty down; when full grown, they are dark green above, and paler beneath. In fall, they turn yellow with rusty spots. The leaf stipules are lanceolate, acute; they fall soon after the leaf expands. The flowers are pale to bright yellow, rarely orange or reddish, with four ribbon-shaped petals long and four short stamens, and grow in clusters; flowering begins in about mid-fall and continues until late fall. The flower calyx is deeply four-parted, very downy, orange brown within, imbricate in bud, persistent, cohering with the base of the ovary. Two or three bractlets appear at base. The fruit is a hard woody capsule long, which splits explosively at the apex at maturity one year after pollination, ejecting the two shiny black seeds up to distant from the parent plant. It can be distinguished from the related Hamamelis vernalis by its flowering in fall, not winter. Ecology It supports 62 species of caterpillars. Uses Native Americans produced witch hazel extract by boiling the stems of the shrub and producing a decoction, which was used to treat swellings, inflammations, and tumors. Early Puritan settlers in New England adopted this remedy from the natives, and its use became widely established in the United States. An extract of the plant is used in the astringent witch hazel. H. virginiana produces a specific kind of tannins called hamamelitannins. One of those substances displays a specific cytotoxic activity against colon cancer cells. The bark and leaves were used by Native Americans in the treatment of external inflammations. Pond's Extract was a popular distillation of the bark in dilute alcohol. The wood is light reddish brown, sapwood nearly white; heavy, hard, close-grained, with a density of 0.68. The forked twigs of witch- hazel are preferred as divining rods.

The piece has four main subdivisions and is based on prayers by S√∏ren Kierkegaard. It is written for chorus, large orchestra, soprano solo and incidental tenor and alto solos. Origins Samuel Barber began writing the Prayers of Kierkegaard with the commission of the Koussevitzky Music Foundation in 1942, but because of World War II and other interruptions, only completed the work 12 years later. It was premiered on December 3, 1954 by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Cecilia Society Chorus, and soprano Leontyne Price, with Charles Munch conducting. Historical significance Samuel Barber chose a selection of prayers by philosopher and theologian S√∏ren Kierkegaard derived from his Journals as well as his books The Unchangeableness of God and Christian Discourses. These works were harsh discourses of the vague practices of the Danish church, and were a direct reflection of Barber's orthodox Presbyterian-Quaker background. In direct correlation with his Hermit Songs (1953), Barber began to use sacred texts to show the realistic but extremely hopeful outlook of American Christianity, especially the Protestantism of this period. Barber once said when speaking about the piece, \\"One finds here three basic truths: imagination, dialectic, and religious melancholy. The truth S√∏ren Kierkegaard sought after was a truth which was a truth for me.\\" Musical significance Prayers of Kierkegaard is an unequivocal religious statement that Samuel Barber divided into four distinct parts, each representing a different prayer. The first section speaks of ‚ÄúGod the Unchangeable‚Äù and begins in an unaccompanied chant performed by unaccompanied male voices in a Gregorian chant style. It then continues with the orchestra responding to the chant in imitative counterpoint until the chorus and orchestra join in climax on the words \\"Thou Art Unchanging\\", repeating the theme of the text. In the second section, which is recited in the first person, the soprano solo receives the melody from an oboe solo. This minimalism, however, is changed in the third section that reflects Russian chorus writing in the thickness of the lines. This prayer grows in both the chorus and the orchestra, until it expands into a dance which ends with the sempre forte \\"Father In Heaven\\" by the chorus. This is one of Samuel Barber's most personal works and \\"the prayers Barber chose to set were taken from Kierkegaard‚Äôs journals and sermons, and reflect both Kierkegaard‚Äôs and Barber‚Äôs belief in the power of God‚Äôs redemption through affirmative human deeds and personal self-awareness.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Giordano, Diego. \\"Samuel Barber: Kierkegaard, From a Musical Point of View\\".

It is currently known as Concord Law School at Purdue University Global and is one of several schools within Purdue University Global. All lecture and study sessions are conducted online.Online Law Schools Have Yet to Pass the Bar March 23, 2011 Established in 1998, Concord Law School was the United States' first fully online law school. History In October 1998, 33 students began the online program. By July 2006, 100 students had passed the California Bar. The merger of Concord into Kaplan University in late 2007 made Concord the first online law school to be part of a regionally accredited university. As the first fully online law school in the United States, the concept of Concord initially drew criticism from the legal establishment, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In June 2016, Martin Pritikin joined Concord Law School as its dean. In 2017, Purdue University, a public university based in Indiana, announced the acquisition of Kaplan University with the aim of making a nonprofit institution and a new online university, Purdue University Global. The acquisition was completed in March 2018 and as a result, the university is now known as Purdue University Global. However, for- profit Kaplan Higher Education still has a 30-year contract to serve Purdue Global. Accreditation status In August 2020, it became accredited by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California. It is not accredited by the ABA. Bar pass rate Concord's pass rate for the July 2019 sitting of the California bar exam was 29% for first-time takers and 17% for repeat takers, compared to 64% and 27% overall pass rates, respectively.  Faculty  The Concord Law School lists 19 faculty: four deans, six professors, and nine adjuncts. Degrees offered Concord offers two Juris Doctor (J.D.) law degrees. The recipients of the regular J.D. degree who pass the California Bar Examination and otherwise meet the California State Bar requirements are admitted to the bar and can practice law in California. California bar licensees may practice in most federal courts outside of California, and may work as in-house counsel in out-of-state corporations, among other roles. Recipients of the Executive Juris Doctor (E.J.D.) are not eligible to take the bar examination. The J.D. program is a 92-unit, four-year program. Students are required to complete at least 22-24 units of coursework between 48 and 52 consecutive weeks each year. Graduates of this program meet the legal education requirement of the Committee of Bar Examiners, State Bar of California and may apply for admission to the State Bar of California. The Concord Law School offers an Executive J.D. (E.J.D.) degree for a 72-unit, three-year program. This degree stirred controversy, with Buzzfeed News reporting that students were misled into thinking the degree would allow them to practice as attorneys. Higher education experts raised concerns about the value of the degree, saying it was misleading for students. Employment Concord‚Äôs website reads, ‚Äò‚ÄôConcord Law School cannot guarantee employment or career advancement,‚Äô‚Äô and no employment information is provided. With a few notable exceptions, graduates cannot practice law outside the State of California. In November 2008, Ross Mitchell, a 2004 Concord graduate who had been admitted to the California bar, sued for and won the right to take the Massachusetts bar exam, which is normally open only to graduates of ABA accredited law schools. In a 6-1 decision, the state's Supreme Judicial Court ruled for Mitchell, citing his excellent law school record and the ability to represent himself and properly present his case. The court also ruled on equitable grounds, noting that under the ABA standards it would have been impossible for Concord to have received accreditation, regardless of the quality of its educational offerings.Court win for online law school grad , California Bar Journal, January 2009Ross E. Mitchell v. Board of Bar Examiners, no. SJC-10157, Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts, September 3, 2008 Mitchell subsequently passed the Massachusetts bar exam in February 2009.

Childhood Marie- Th√©r√®se was the daughter of Edward von Solms, consul of W√ºrttemberg in Paris, and Olympe Adrienne Bentzon. She was born in the family house, owned by her grandparents. She had a brother, from whom we know nothing. Her grandmother, a woman she never mentions in her letters except to say she was a \\"witty and sound Parisian\\" was at that time remarried to the Marquis de Vitry, an old French aristocrat, born before the French Revolution, who used to tell her story about this era. Although her biological maternal grandfather died when her mother was very young, she mentions in her letters to Theodore Stanton that she was raised with an admiration for this unknown grandfather,Stanton, Theodore, \\"Autobiographical notes of Madame Blanc\\" The North American Review Vol. 166, Issue 498. (May 1898). Major Adrian Benjamin Bentzon, governor of the Danish West Indies from 1816 to 1820. The major, after Denmark lost the Virgin Islands, went on to file a case in the US Supreme Court arguing he should have his sugar canes plantations back. After living in America with his family, Adrian Bentzon went back to Europe, but died later in the Caribbeans. His wife later married the Marquis de Vitry, installed in the small village of Seine-Port. Marie-Th√©r√®se was in part raised by her grandparents and the new husband of her mother, Count Antoine Cartier D'Aure, whom her mother had married shortly after her father's death (her father was 13 years older than her mother, as her birth certificate demonstrates). At her grandparents' home she received a cosmopolitan education, learning German and English, due to her father's origins and having an English nurse. She was taught every day at their house by the village's school teacher, and from him learned Greek, Latin and how to write. She married in 1856 to a Louis Blanc, but three years later, after having a son, her husband left her. It isn't clear if he died or simple if they divorced, but she mentions in her letters to Stanton that after three years of a long and grieving time, she finally got free. But with this freedom also came the need for money to provide for her son, whose name is unknown (he is mentioned by the Goncourt brothers as the \\"son of Madame Blanc\\"The Goncourt brothers' journal). After working for different newspapers and magazines, she was introduced by her grandfather, the Count Antoine Cartier D'Aure to George Sand, and spent a lot of time at Sand's house, in Nohant, helping her with her recording of events happening here. Sand mentions her in her journal.Jenney Howe, Marie. George Sand. The Intimate Journal. Chicago: Academy of Chicago Publishers, 1978. Her grandfather and Sand shared an interest for horses, and he had helped the writer buy some pure-breed race horses. As a thank she agreed to read a short novel written by his granddaughter, and to present her to the then editor of the Revue des Deux Mondes, Fran√ßois Buloz. This was the real beginning of her writing career. As an alias, she took her mother's maiden name, and generally was known as \\"Th√©odore Bentzon\\" a masculine penname that was voluntarily identifying her as a man, for a woman writing was not well perceived in the nineteenth century. The Revue des Deux Mondes After Sand insisted, and helped by Victor Cherbuliez, a reluctant Buloz let her in, as a literary critic, in 1872. She stayed in the magazine up until one year before her death. Thanks to her fluent English, she was appointed to the translation and comment of very important American and English authors, and it contributed to build her a solid network in the United States. Her work at the magazine consisted essentially in writing critics pertaining to the Anglo- Saxon, German and Russian world. She also published most of her fictional work through the magazine, while developing her friendship with major literary figures of her time. By the time the magazine's direction changed to Ferdinand Bruneti√®re, she had become a prominent writer at it. She lived the best years of the magazine. In 1893, she was sent by the Revue des Deux Mondes in the US to report on the women's condition there. She left France in the first part of 1893, and from New York City went to Chicago. After spending a couple of months there, she took the train to Boston, where she spent almost a year, with trips to Louisiana and the Midwest. During her stay she went to visit Jane Addams, the founder of Hull House, met Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. just before he died, and saw Jacob Riis during a lecture on one of his latest novels. She also met political, feminists and abolitionist figures. At her return from the US, she compiled her articles in a book, a travel journal, published in 1896 by Calmann-Levy. She visited the US again in 1897 for a shorter amount of time. Her travel journal was a best-seller and was edited again 8 times, in different editions, the latest in 1904. The American Women At Home First published in 1896, her travel notes were organized around the remarks she had about American women. Her travel notes are not considered to be very original in terms of opinion on America, but the subjects she chose (education of and for women, women in society and the charity system in America) make her notes original according to William Chew's researches.Chew, William. Shifting Identities in Late 19th Century French Feminism: the case of Th. Bentzon. Her book also accords a great importance on urban America, making a thorough portrayal of it. Her work Among her essays are Litt√©rature et m≈ìurs √©trang√®res (1882) and Les nouveaux romanciers am√©ricains (1885). Her novels include: *La vocation de Louise (1873) *Sang m√™l√© (1875) *Un remords (1878) *Yette, histoire d'une jeune Cr√©ole (1880; 1882) *Yvonne (1881) *Tony (1884), crowned by the French Academy *Contes de tous les pays (1890) *Jacqueline (1893) *Une double √©preuve (1896) *Au dessus de l'abime (1905) She also wrote Nouvelle France et Nouvelle Angleterre: Notes de Voyage (1899); Choses et gens d'Am√©rique, Questions Americaines, and Femmes d' Am√©rique, and translated works by Dickens, Bret Harte, Ouida, Aldrich, and Mark Twain.

Slenaken was a separate municipality until 1982, when it was merged with Wittem. Geography=Site Slenaken is located in the municipality of Gulpen-Wittem in Limburg, and is one of the southernmost villages of the Netherlands, close to the frontier with Belgian Limburg, and along the valley of the Gulp river. To the north of the village is the Loorberg Hill, with the village of Epen, beyond that, to the northeast. The village of Noorbeek lies to the west of Slenaken, and across the border to the south are the little settlements of Nurop and Teuven. Slenaken itself is ringed by the hamlets of Beutenaken, Heijenrath and Schilberg, which for many purposes are treated as part of Slenaken. History On a bank of the River Gulp, just to the south of Slenaken, is the \\"grinding stone of Slenaken\\" (\\"Slijpsteen van Slenaken\\"), a large flint boulder used in the Neolithic period to polish stone axe heads. The earliest surviving written record of Slenaken dates from 1252. At that time, along with the parish, Slenaken comprised a handful of houses and farmsteads. At some point before 1428 a small chapel was constructed. There is a legend that this was triggered when a shepherd saw one of his sheep kneeling before a \\"cross\\" in a burning bush.Gerard C. Ubaghs, Geschiedkundig overzigt van Gulpen en deszelfs onderhoorige plaatsen, Maastricht: Hollmann, 1865, 55 & 57. This inspired the villagers to build the little chapel, where they came together each Friday to venerate the Holy Cross. Starting in 1495, the site expanded and became a monastery. By 1676 the village was part of the (today Belgian) parish of St. Martens-Voeren. In 1793, after a number of conflicts, the St. Remigus church, the current church, was built.

' is a jackal that usually features as the chief villain in strips of the Kalia the Crow series. He is usually seen working together with his accomplice and friend Doob Doob, the crocodile.

He has a she-jackal friend named Chamataki. Doob Doob the crocodile is a loyal friend of Chamataka, and is somewhat dimwitted. He usually dislikes Kalia but is sometimes used by Kalia to save the rabbits. Doob Doob cherishes a dream of being able to fly. Doob Doob has a fianc√©e named Lubdubi. Keechu and Meechu are the two rabbits who are always the target of Chamataka, in almost every episode. Shonar is a spotted deer that appears occasionally in the comics. Normally he is also a target of the Chamataka and Doob Doob, but is always saved by Kalia. Babloo is a bear who is friend of Kalia. He is always angry with Chamataka because Chamataka frequently steals his precious honeycombs. Chamataka is very much afraid of being caught by Babloo as he has been punished by Babloo many times for the thefts. Kalia often \\"uses\\" Babloo to save the other animals from Chamataka. Kalia's other lesser known friends are Sayal the porcupine, Sundar the peacock, Sundari the peahen, an elephant (referred to as Brother Elephant), and a bison.

Synopsis There was an old, poor fisherman who cast his net four times a day and only four times. One day he went to the shore and cast his net. When he tried to pull it up, he found it to be heavy. When he dove in and pulled up the net, he found a dead donkey in it. Then he cast his net again and netted a pitcher full of dirt. Then he cast his net for a third time and netted shards of pottery and glass. On his fourth and final try, he called upon the name of God and cast his net. When he pulled it up he found a copper jar with a cap that had the seal of Solomon on it. The fisherman was overjoyed, since he could sell the jar for money. He was curious of what was inside the jar, and removed the cap with his knife. A plume of smoke came out of the jar and condensed into an Ifrit (a more powerful, malevolent jinni). The fisherman was frightened, although initially the jinni did not notice him. The jinni thought that Solomon had come to kill him. When the fisherman told him that Solomon had been dead for many centuries, the Jinni was overjoyed and granted the fisherman a choice of the manner of his death. The jinni explained that for the first hundred years of his imprisonment, he swore to enrich the person who freed him forever, but nobody freed him. For the second century of his imprisonment, he swore to grant his liberator great wealth, but nobody freed him. After another century, he swore to grant three wishes to the person who freed him, yet nobody did so. After four hundred years of imprisonment, the jinni became enraged and swore to grant the person who freed him a choice of deaths. The fisherman pleaded for his life, but the jinni would not concede. The fisherman decided to trick the jinni. He asked the jinni how he managed to fit into the bottle. The jinni, eager to show off, shrank and placed himself back into the bottle to demonstrate his abilities. The fisherman quickly put the cap back on and threatened to throw it back to the sea. The jinni pleaded with the fisherman, who began to tell the story of \\"The Wazir and the Sage Duban\\" as an example of why the jinni should have spared him. After the story, the jinni pleaded for mercy, and swore to help him in return for being released. The fisherman accepted the bargain, and released the jinni. The jinni then led the fisherman to a pond with many exotic fish, and the fisherman caught four. Before disappearing, the jinni told the fisherman to give the fish to the Sultan. The fisherman did so and was rewarded with money for presenting the fishes. Every time a fish was fried, a person would appear and question them, and the fish answered. When the fish would be flipped in the pan, it would be charred. Awed by the sight, the Sultan asked the fisherman where he got the fish and went to the pond to uncover their mystery. When he reached his destination, the Sultan found a young man who was half man and half stone. The young man recounted his story, as the story of \\"The Ensorcelled Prince\\". The Sultan then assisted the Prince in his liberation and revenge. They became close friends, and the fisherman who first found the fish was rewarded with his son being appointed the Sultan's treasurer, and the Sultan and the Prince married the fisherman's two beautiful daughters.

He previously coached the Milwaukee Wave of Major Indoor Soccer League. Player=College Tozer grew up in upstate New York. After graduating from high school, he attended Oneonta State from 1975 to 1979, where he played as a forward on the men's soccer team. He finished his four seasons at Oneonta with the school's all-time points record of 117 points off 50 goals and 17 assists. In 2002, Oneonta State inducted Tozer into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional In 1978, the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) was preparing for its first season. When they held their first college draft, the Cincinnati Kids selected Tozer as the league's first draft pick. He played a single season with the Kids, as the team folded at the end of the 1978‚Äì1979 season. When the Kids folded, Tozer moved outdoors to the Pennsylvania Stoners for the 1979 American Soccer League season. The Stoners made it to the league's playoff semifinals before being eliminated by the Columbus Magic. Tozer moved back to the MISL where he played for the Hartford Hellions for two seasons. At the end of the 1980‚Äì1981 season, Hartford moved to Memphis. Tozer did not move with the team, but joined the Pittsburgh Spirit. Tozer spent the next three seasons with the Spirit. While with the Spirit, Tozer spent time assisting with a summer soccer camp. That experience gave Tozer a taste for coaching which he would use in later years. In 1984, Tozer left both the Spirit and MISL when he moved to the Louisville Thunder of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA). The AISA was formed in March 1984 as a rival to MISL. Tozer played nearly 100 games with the Thunder over three seasons, but more significantly, he was the team's head coach. In his first two seasons with the Thunder, Tozer saw his team fall in the championship series to the Canton Invaders. In his third season with the team, Tozer and the Thunder finally mastered the Invaders, winning their first AISA championship. Tozer left the Thunder in 1987 to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Lazers (MISL), having coached the Thunder to a 70-37 record, three championship series and one AISA title. Coach=Professional In 1987, Tozer became the head coach of the Lazers. Over the next two seasons, Tozer coached the team to a 62-70 record. In 1989 the Lazers folded and Tozer moved back to the AISA where he became a player/coach for the Atlanta Attack. He played only one season with the Attack, 1989‚Äì1990. At the end of the season, he retired from playing professionally, becoming a dedicated head coach for the Attack. He remained with the team when it moved to Kansas City in 1991 to become the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) Kansas City Attack. When Tozer left the team at the end of the 1991‚Äì1992 season, he had led the team to a 74-46 record. Tozer joined the Milwaukee Wave in 1992 and no longer coaches the team today. In 1997‚Äì1998 he took the Wave to their first NPSL championship, and since then Tozer and the Wave won the NPSL title two more times, in 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì2001. In 2001, the NPSL became the second incarnation of Major Indoor Soccer League. Tozer and the Wave continued their winning way, taking the MISL championship in 2004‚Äì2005. Tozer guided the Wave again to a 15-5 record during the 2010-11 season tied with the Baltimore Blast for first place. The Wave beat the Missouri Comets in two games in the semi- finals and then beat the Baltimore Blast 16-7 in Baltimore for the Wave's fifth MISL Championship. On January 29, 2012, Tozer recorded his 700th win as a coach in a 25-10 victory over the Syracuse Silver Knights. Tozer is currently the winningest professional indoor coach in North American indoor soccer history. On March 28, 2014, he parted ways on good terms as coach of the Milwaukee Wave. Futsal Tozer's success as a professional indoor coach has led to his selection as the interim U.S. Futsal team coach in 1996. He took the U.S. to the 1996 CONCACAF Futsal championship that year. Despite that success, he remained and interim/assistant coach until 1998 when he was hired as the team's head coach. That year he took the U.S. to third, its best finish ever, at the 1998 Futsal World Cup. In 2000, the U.S. took third at the CONCACAF championship before winning the tournament in 2004.http://soccerhalloffame.org/news/FutsalCONCACAF_Gold_812004.htm Since 1984 Tozer has become one of the most successful coaches in U.S. soccer history, and the all-time winningest coach in North America indoor soccer with over 700 wins, six league championships and eight \\"coach of the year awards., He also owns a motivational company, Teamwork Concepts.

Club career=Shamrock Rovers He made his League of Ireland debut on 20 May 2005, keeping a clean sheet against Waterford, after the departure of Russell Payne. Having come through the club's youth system in 2004, where he was U21 Player of the Year, he made rapid progress to become the club's Young Player of the Year and Player of the Year for 2005. He played a total of 25 league games in his first season keeping seven clean sheets. Murphy kept 24 clean sheets from 35 games during the 2006 campaign as Rovers won the First Division. He made his 100th competitive appearance for The Hoops on 2 October 2007 at Bray Wanderers where for the first time in his Rovers career, he was not only booked but sent off. For the 2007 season he kept 16 clean sheets in 29 league games as Rovers finished fifth in the league. Midway through the 2009 season, Murphy was dropped as first choice goalkeeper by Michael O'Neill and replaced by new signing, Alan Mannus who held on to the position for the remainder of the campaign. Bohemians Having reportedly turned down a new contract at Shamrock Rovers, no press release confirming his departure was ever issued by the club, Murphy reportedly signed for rivals, Bohemians in time for the start of the 2010 League of Ireland season.

Murphy spent the first half of the season as first choice goalkeeper for Pat Fenlon's side but lost his place midway through the season after some poor performances. When Chris O'Connor was suspended towards the end of the season, Murphy regained his place and put in some man of the match performances, most notably against St. Patrick's Athletic on 9 October. Unfortunately for Murphy and Bohs, they would lose the league title on goal difference. This qualified them for the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League qualifiers where they played NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005). Murphy playing in both legs as Bohs were eliminated. St Patrick's Athletic On 4 January 2012, it was confirmed that Murphy had signed for St Patrick's Athletic for the 2012 season.

Career Rowe signed for Sunderland after impressing in the Milk Cup but after two and a half years, he returned home to sign for Shelbourne where he made his League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers on 2 September 2002. However that was his only appearance that season and so he was sent on loan at the end of the season to Crusaders. He returned to Shels shortly after for the beginning of the 2003 season and made 12 appearances as the Reds captured the Premier Division title. Rowe played a bigger role in retaining that crown 12 months later when he made 17 appearances and scored three goals and also representing his country in a Four Nations Tournament in Scotland in May 2004. He left Shels to join Saint Patrick's Athletic on-loan ahead of the 2005 campaign. At Richmond Park, Rowe scored four goals in 26 league appearances before, after leaving the Saints and being released by Shels, he found his way to Ballymena United for a spell during the 2005/06 season. After one goal in 13 outings, Ger returned to the League of Ireland in July 2006 when he was snapped up by Pat Scully to aid Shamrock Rovers‚Äô First Division title assault. It proved a shrewd move by Scully as Rowe scored on his debut against Athlone Town before going on to net a further six in 13 more outings as the Hoops narrowly held off the challenge of Dundalk by a single point ‚Äì although the margin of victory was lessened after the Dublin club were deducted three points for playing the suspended Paul Shiels against the Lilywhites earlier that season. Rowe remained on for Rovers‚Äô return to the Premier Division after a one-season absence and scored six times in 29 appearances as the club finished a respectable fifth after threatening to derail Drogheda United's title charge for long periods before they tailed off towards the end of the campaign. Rowe then looked set for a second full season with Rovers but he placed himself on the transfer list on 15 January 2007 before being taken off it 16 days later However, the want-away striker finally got his wish in February 2008 when he was snapped up by Bray Wanderers' manager Eddie Gormley. He was an ever-present for the Carlisle Grounds outfit, appearing in 30 of their 33 league games and scoring four goals. However, he was released from the club at the end of the season after they finished an eye-catching sixth. Rowe also scored against Leeds United in a friendly on 20/7/20008. His goal helped Bray race in into a 2‚Äì0 lead before half time, but Bray eventually lost 3‚Äì2. His release sparked interest from Bohemians, who had previously chased the striker, and he spent pre-season there with his former boss Fenlon. However, despite still training with the squad when their season kicked off away to Dundalk, the money was not available to offer Ger a contract and he left. Eventually, he ended up in Vietnam where he spent a week at TT Ha Noi, however, after being unimpressed with the setup there he returned home to Ireland and took up Sean Connor‚Äôs offer to join Dundalk. He made his debut for the Lilywhites when he entered as a second-half substitute in the 2‚Äì1 defeat by Cork City at Oriel Park on 17 April 2009 while his first start came a fortnight later in the 5‚Äì0 loss at Bohemians. He scored his first club goal in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Bray Wanderers on 5 June. Ger was also, incidentally, capped by the Republic of Ireland under-23 team three times in the past two years while he has also been capped at under-16 level.

Griscom also served in the 1990s as the executive vice president for external relations for the RJ Reynolds Tobacco company, as an employee of Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd; and as a public relations consultant with Powell- Tate. In December 1998, Fortune magazine's \\"The Power of 25: the influence merchants\\" named Griscom, along with other ex-White House staff, ex- politicians and sons-of-politicians, as a key lobbyist in Washington. Life and career=Journalism He was political editor at The Chattanooga News- Free Press. Politics In 1978 Griscom joined the staff of Senator Baker and served as press secretary. In 1985-86, after Baker's retirement from the Senate, Griscom served as the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), and was charged with the task of overseeing the re-election efforts of the Republican majority in the Senate. He later became part of the Reagan administration in 1987, while Baker was chief of staff. As Baker's senior staff person, he essentially ran day-to-day operations at the White House, and he maintained the strong links between the administration and the Republican Party. His most notable claim during this period was that, in 1987, as communications director at the White House, he approved and promoted (against diplomatic advice) Peter Robinson's draft speech made at the Berlin Wall, where President Reagan demanded that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev \\"tear down this wall\\".http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3550602.html Reynolds Tobacco In 1990 he joined Reynolds Tobacco as head of its external relations program, and over the next 10 years he was responsible for the company's strategic operations against the growing anti-smoking forces. He also administered and organized the company's involvement in the many cooperative campaigns conducted with Philip Morris and the Tobacco Institute in lobbying the United States Congress to block anti-smoking legislation. RJR also took a lead role at this time in conducting misinformation campaigns for media and public consumption‚Äîespecially in the promotion of the idea that health regulations were largely the product of junk science. Not long after joining RJR, Griscom became a key director on the management committee of the Tobacco Institute, responsible for secretly funding friendly think tanks and other organizations, and for organizing scientists, lawyers and other business allies to attack regulatory measures that blocked cigarette advertising, or those that introduced environmental and health regulations. Steve Milloy, who ran the fake \\"scientific grassroots\\" organisation known as the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) and its junk science website for Philip Morris on behalf of the tobacco industry, was transferred in mid-1996 to the control of Reynolds under Griscom when TASSC and the junkscience.com links with Philip Morris were exposed. Griscom subcontracted the administration of this \\"sound-science\\" operation to Jody Powell (ex-press secretary to President Jimmy Carter) and Sheila Tate, (First Lady Nancy Reagan's adviser) at Powell- Tate. RJR and Powell-Tate also handled the distribution of Milloy's book Science without Sense, supposedly published by the Cato Institute (which was itself funded by tobacco interests).http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/cgi/getdoc?tid=ryq70d00&fmt;=pdf&ref;=results Similar books were commissioned and payment laundered through think tanks for academic authors. One other \\"successful\\" program run at this time was to characterise relatively harmless substances as \\"potentially cancerous\\" as part of the industry's \\"sound-science\\" campaign. Griscom's PR staff attempted to both promote and ridicule the idea that coffee could cause cancer via Milloy's junk-science web pages and op-ed articles planted in newspapers. This created the straw-man idea that everything enjoyable could be classed as potentially dangerous (to counter fears about passive smoking) and no one could live without taking the normal risks associated with living. Smoking, they implied, was no different from drinking coffee. Griscom's communications and media division of RJR also hired state and federal lobbyists, planted ghost-written articles and letters to the editor in major newspapers and magazines and promoted seemingly normal tours by comedians, musicians, artists, etc. who were all carefully trained and contracted to promote the pro-smoking message. In 1997-1998, Griscom represented R.J. Reynolds on a long series of tobacco industry negotiations with the State Attorneys-General, the Justices Department, the White House and its agencies. This led to a February 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the tobacco industry agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for Medicaid costs associated with smoking to avoid charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). He left R.J. Reynolds in the later half of 1999 and returned to Chattanooga \\"to help shape the overall identity\\" of the city's now single daily print newspaper, formed after WEHCO Media bought and merged the fiercely competitive afternoon Free Press and the morning The Chattanooga Times to create the Chattanooga Times Free Press. On May 26, 2010, Griscom announced he would resign from the newspaper June 30, 2010. Personal life Griscom is married to the former Marion Dobbins.
