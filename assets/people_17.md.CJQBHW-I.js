The ministry was headed by Ziya Mammadov until February 13, 2017 when the ministry was reformed into Ministry of Transport, Communications and High Technologies. History The Ministry was established on August 5, 1998 by the Presidential Decree No. 743. The statute of the Ministry was approved by the President Heydar Aliyev on June 10, 2003. According to the Ministry charter, it is responsible for organization and implementation of state policies in the state railway, water, air and automobile transportation sector. On February 13, 2017 the Ministry was absorbed into the newly founded Ministry of Transport, Communications and High Technologies. Structure The Ministry was headed by the Minister of Transport, aided by two deputies. Its main functions were the regulation of activities in the transportation sector of Azerbaijan consisting of transportation activities of entities by railway, water, automobile, air; shipping and expedition activities; design, projection and construction of roads, repairs and maintenance of roads; technical maintenance of hydrotechnical equipment in maritime transportation; preparation of human resources and implementation of scientific research; cooperation with transportation ministries in other countries for joint projects. Projects The ministry was involved in big international projects such as TRACECA for revitalization of the Ancient Silk Way or the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway. Almost all transport projects within Azerbaijan except for oil and gas pipelines such as Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan were regulated by the Ministry of Transport. High economic growth in Azerbaijan in the recent years triggered many construction projects including repairs and construction of new roads throughout the country. In 2004, 46 km road between Ələt and Qazıməmməd was built, 6 new overpass bridges were built in Gabala, Tovuz, Gadabay, Ujar, Quba and Biləcəri, 290 km and 178 km of existing roads, 3 bridges were extensively repaired. Several sections of major interstate roads such as 508 km long Baku- Ələt-Qazakh highway, 85 km long Qazıməmməd-Kurdamir, 188 km long Kurdamir- Ucar-Yevlakh-Ganja were rebuilt according to international standards. In late 2009, the ministry signed a protocol with the Korean International Cooperation Agency for the feasibility study for Baku Bay Sea Bridge Project. The projected bridge will connect Shykh with Zığ settlement stretching over Bay of Baku for 14.5 km. Transport Minister Ziya Mammadov and President of Stadler Rail Group Peter Spuhler informed the President that Swiss Stadler Rail Group and Azerbaijan-based Railway International Distribution LLC signed a contract on establishment of joint venture for wagon-assembling.

Background  With this Declaration, published in German, English, Italian, French and Polish, the aim of the Kunsthistorisches Institut is to foster understanding of the fundamental importance of analogue photos and photo archives for the future of the arts, humanities and social sciences. The Florence Declaration was presented on 31 October 2009 in the framework of the International Conference “Photo Archives and the Photographic Memory of Art History – Part II” (Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz, 29–31 October 2009). Since then the Declaration has received the backing and been subscribed by numerous international scholars.  Content of the Declaration  Against the background of the ongoing debate on the complete digitization of photo archives and the frequent demands thus being made for the gradual winding up of photo archives and their conversion into digital and internet searchable forms, the Florence Declaration supports the view that, while the digitization of photographic collections is undoubtedly an aim worth pursuing, digital photos can only in part replace the original photographic print. Digital archives cannot therefore entirely take over the task of analogue archives. For technologies not only condition the methods of transmission, conservation and use of documents, but also shape their content. An analogue photo and its digital reproduction should therefore be considered two distinct objects. They each have different features. They cannot be interchanged. Since fields of research and topics of investigation in the human and social sciences have greatly changed in recent years, and analogue photography itself has increasingly become a focus of scholarly research, it is essential, according to the Florence Declaration, to overcome the traditional equivalence between analogue photographs and their digital reproduction. Importance of analogue photos In this context, a particular significance is attributed in the Florence Declaration to the character of analogue photos as material objects. Each analogue photo is thus said to possess a “biography” of its own that is expressed in various aspects such as the moment of its production, the technology used, the aim of its production, and its incorporation in the context of a particular archive and its system. Particular emphasis is placed on the tactile features of analogue photos, which are indispensable for their use in research and which are inevitably lost during the process of digital reproduction. The digital format is unable to reconstruct the “biography” of each photo in all its aspects and can only have a partial character. The combination of visual and material qualities with which an analogue photo is distinguished would, in the digitization process itself, be lost and its complexity inevitably reduced. Consequently, the idea of total accessibility connected to the digital format through databases would be illusory. While internet access is ideally independent of place and time, it also limits access to a single component of the photographic object: the digitalized image. Since digitization projects are necessarily bound up with a selection of particular aspects of the material, a wholly digitalized “capture” of the object with all its qualities would be impossible. The Florence Declaration further points out the inherent obsolescence and instability of the digital format itself: so far little reliable information is available on whether the long-term archiving of digital information is viable and how far online databases and internet structures can be maintained in the long run. Archive Research on photographs, moreover, is indissolubly bound up with the context of their conservation: the photo archive. Each photo archive is not just the sum of the single photographs preserved in it, but represents a unique and autonomous structure. For the human and social sciences it has the role of a laboratory: a place for the production and interpretation of knowledge. The physical context of an analogue photo library and the opportunities it opens up for research are fundamentally different from the conditions of a database that can be consulted online. In the view of the Florence Declaration it is therefore essential that the photo archive, not only as a tool, but also as an object of research, be preserved in all its structures and functions and that continuing access to it be guaranteed. For analogue archives are part of our cultural heritage, and in their overall structure can themselves become an important field for research. So the Florence Declaration and its subscribers appeal for the preservation of analogue photo libraries: digital libraries, they insist, ought not to replace but supplement them, so that scientific research and the tools for interpretation at the disposal of researchers be not limited, but expanded.

Early life Sargent was born in 1745 and baptized on June 23, 1745 in Salem, Massachusetts. He was the son of Katherine Winthrop (1711–1781), a widow of Samuel Brown and the second wife of his father, Epes Sargent. His father was one of the largest landholders in Gloucester and was a colonel of militia before the Revolution and a justice of the general session court for more than thirty years. His younger brother was John Sargent (1750–1824), was an exiled loyalist who became a lieutenant in the King's American Regiment, and his elder half-brothers included Winthrop Sargent (1727–1793) and Daniel Sargent Sr. (1730–1806), a prominent merchant. As a first name, 'Winthrop' occurs frequently among descendants of Epes Sargent's first wife, Esther McCarty, though it was Colonel Sargent's mother Katharine Winthrop Browne who was descended from Governor Winthrop, not she. His maternal grandparents were Ann Dudley, daughter of Joseph Dudley, and John Winthrop (1681–1747), son of Wait Winthrop, grandson of John Winthrop the Younger and great-grandson of John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Sargent's paternal ancestor, William, came to America from Gloucester, England, before 1678. Among his first cousins was Dudley Saltonstall, a notorious Revolutionary War naval commander. Through his brother Winthrop, he was uncle to Winthrop Sargent (1753–1820), a major in the Continental Army who was appointed the first Governor of the Mississippi Territory by president John Adams, and Judith Sargent Murray, an early American advocate for women's rights, essayist, playwright, poet, and letter writer. Through his brother Daniel, he was an uncle to Lucius Manlius Sargent, the author, antiquarian, and temperance advocate, Henry Sargent, the artist who was the father of Henry Winthrop Sargent, the prominent horticulturist, and merchant prince Daniel Sargent of Boston, paid the elderly Colonel Sargent's respects to his former comrade-in-arms Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette during the latter's visit to the United States in 1824. The painter John Singer Sargent was descended from the first Winthrop Sargent's youngest son Fitzwilliam. Career=Revolutionary War Service Paul Dudley Sargent commanded a regiment at the Siege of Boston, was wounded at Bunker Hill, commanded a brigade in the summer of 1776, and fought at Harlem Heights, White Plains, Trenton, and Princeton. See the List of Continental Army units (1776) for information on Col. Sargent's regiment, the 16th Continental, (later designated the 8th Massachusetts), and the Massachusetts Line article for his earlier command of the 27th Massachusetts, disbanded after the Siege of Boston. For a time during the campaign in New York in '76 he was brevetted Brigadier General, having taken command of the regiments of Col.s Selden, Talcott & Ward in addition to his own.How, David (1865). Diary of David How, a private in Colonel Paul Dudley Sargent's regiment of the Massachusetts line, in the army of the American Revolution. Morrisania, NY: H. O. Houghton and Company. He and his regiment were among the force that famously crossed the Delaware with Washington on December 25, 1776. Sargent also had interests as owner or bonder in numerous privateer vessels, on his own behalf and in partnership with James Swan, Mungo Mackay, Joseph Barrell and others. Among these was one of the largest privateers ever commissioned, the 300-ton three- decker Boston, formerly the British merchant ship Zachariah Bayley, captured by Sargent's much smaller privateer Yankee in 1776.Allen, Gardner Weld (1927). Massachusetts Privateers of the Revolution. Boston, Massachusetts: Massachusetts Historical Society. Laden with supplies intended for the British army, the prize was significant enough to be the subject of congratulatory correspondence between Gen. Washington and John Hancock.NDAR, \\"George Washington to John Hancock,\\" V, 1072-1073 Though apparently separated from the Continental Army as of 1777 Sargent remained active in the Revolutionary cause, being commissioned Colonel of the 1st Regiment Essex County Massachusetts Militia, September 26, 1778.Catalogue (1921). Portraits of Epes and Ann Sargent, children of William Sargent, 2nd, and their descendants in the Sargent-Murray-Gilman house, Gloucester, Massachusetts. Printed privately. Post-war Occupations After the war, ruined by shipping losses, Sargent withdrew to the hinterlands, serving as chief justice of the court of common pleas of Hancock County, Maine, its first judge of probate, first representative of the (pre-statehood) district to the Massachusetts General Court, postmaster, justice of the peace, and as one of the founding overseers of Bowdoin College. It is unclear whether Sargent continued his privateering activities after the war, but he did engage in real estate speculation, successfully petitioning in 1784 to acquire an archipelago off the Maine coast including Rogues, later Roques Island,(1784). Acts and Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, ch. 22. Boston, Massachusetts: Adams & Nourse. which some years afterwards was transferred to the Peabody family, whose descendants the Gardners still hold it. By 1788 he and his family had moved to Sullivan, on the mainland not far from Rogues. There is reason to suppose the departure from Boston for such a distant place may have been in part an attempt to evade creditors. In 1803 Sargent played an inadvertent role in a test of the early republic's constitutionally mandated separation of powers, having been, along with William Vinal, the target of an effort by the Massachusetts General Court to strip him of his commission as Justice of the Peace for seeking to be reimbursed for expenses in amounts in excess of what was allowed. \\"It was urged in mitigation that the charges against the judges 'originated in party contention and personal revenge', and in view of the fact that Sargent's overcharge amounted to only $3.33 and Vinal's to only $9, the statement is probably true.\\"(1919). Bulletins for the Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, Volume 2, p. 553-54. Boston, Massachusetts: Wright & Potter Printing Company. Since the assembly's action had removed the judges' powers without a hearing, it was felt by John Quincy Adams and Henry Knox, among others, that the future independence of the judiciary was threatened by the precedent. Both put their names to strongly worded protests.(1919). Bulletins for the Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, Volume 2, p. 585. Boston, Massachusetts: Wright & Potter Printing Company. Unlike many of his business partners and relatives, Sargent left no monument of domestic architecture by Charles Bulfinch or oil portrait by John Singleton Copley or Gilbert Stuart. However he did manage to raise a large number of educated and accomplished young men and women despite the remoteness and comparative poverty of his retirement. A well-stocked library, frequent extended stays with family in Boston and Salem, and much visiting back and forth with French revolutionary expatriates at nearby Fontaine Leval contributed to the cultivated atmosphere of the Sargent household, where Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord was a guest on at least one occasion.Sargent, Ignatius (January, 1887). Colonel Paul Dudley Sargent of Sullivan, Maine, and Family. Bangor, Maine: Bangor Historical Magazine. Perhaps representative of Sargent's taste, or that of any man of his times and circle, is the silver service he commissioned from Paul Revere when in funds during 1781, the tea pot being the same type as that displayed in the famous portrait of its creator by Copley.Yves Henry Buhler, Mrs. (1961) Toward a Tea Set by Paul Revere.

Sargent's wife was Lucy Smith Sanders (often spelled 'Saunders', as it is pronounced) of the Salem mercantile family which gave its name to Sanders Theater in Harvard's Memorial Hall and whose members were among the first mansion-builders in Salem's Chestnut Street District. Like other branches of the family, the Sargents of Sullivan have many descendants.Sargent, Emma Worcester (1923). Epes Sargent of Gloucester and his Descendants.

History SPIDER began in 1998 as a web project to convert a single course module into an interactive web environment. Originally in 1998 SPIDER was a \\"static\\" website and was coded in HTML. This type of coding became a flaw to development as hand scripting HTML became very time consuming. Development Timeline The development of SPIDER is documented from its creation in 1998. The following bullet points give the main development from previous versions. * 1998 SPIDER: Approximately 120 students. * 1999 SPIDER 1A: Move to dynamic, database backed system (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). * 2001 SPIDER II: Caters for around 550 students. * 2002 SPIDER II/III: Improved content management system; new content creation tools; quiz builder. * 2003 SPIDER III: SPIDER system modified to allow for faculty wide use, using \\"clusters\\" to allow different departments/ groups of departments to control own content. * 2004: Authentication and integration with central university systems (LDAP/ADS, PEGASUS). * 2005 SPIDER V Start of session 05-06 sees over 10,000 registered users. * 2006: Around 900 classes from dozens of degrees use SPIDER to support their teaching. * 2007: Classes climb to over 1000 in 11 clusters, with over 7,500 users logging per month. * 2008: SPIDER has over 26,000 users (1,300 staff, 15,000 students, 10,000 alumni). * 2009: Over 20.8 million visits for the year, delivering 1400+ classes for over 160 degree programmes. * 2010: core of SPIDER re-written to improve database, data handling and form management; CSS reworked in combination with the core rewrite to allow for \\"SPIDER-mobile\\" . Benefits of SPIDER=clusters The SPIDER system is organised into clusters. Each cluster represents an academic degree or a series of related academic degrees, which allows administration and management of classes and content to be handled by different departments. For example, all pharmacy related content is in the pharmacy cluster, chemistry content in the chemistry cluster and so on, with each cluster having its own administrator, sub-administrators and editors in charge of management and control of their own classes and materials. The availability of clusters is one of SPIDER's unique features. It allows for much finer control and better organisation of content than typical VLEs which have a very flat structure, a single layer of classes controlled by tutors. There may be hundreds or even thousands of these classes, but there is no unit or department structure to allow for sensible grouping of classes and their control. SPIDER's cluster system provides an extra level of hierarchy that allows for devolved administration by allocating each class to a department within a cluster. Administrators within the cluster then have complete control of their own classes and content, but have no control over those in other clusters. At the same time student users are able to view classes and content across cluster boundaries. As a result of this cluster being available, many of SPIDER's tools have the flexibility to operate at both the class and academic degree/ programme/ unit level. For example, staff users on SPIDER are able to target news items at several classes in their cluster or even at year level. This news will only be seen by students in the matching cluster - so if a Pharmacy lecturer were to post news for year 1 pharmacy students, this won't be seen by chemistry or physics students. However, if the target is a class code (e.g. a mathematics class taken by chemists and pharmacists) the news will be seen by anyone in any cluster who has the code set in their news filter. In addition the user object exists within a cluster, allowing suitably authorised users to view all the data corresponding to a user in their cluster. This would allow a year co-ordinator to see all a student's results across all their classes without having to own or be a tutor in every single class that the student is taking sessions and archiving SPIDER makes use of an academic session to establish which content is current and which is archived. Class lists, group membership, class content, exam & quiz results and many other tools are 'session aware' so that the user is presented with the active data or can choose to view archived data. The session preserves the data in these tools as it was at the time the activity took place. This enables students who are viewing their previous classes for revision or resitting classes to see exactly the content and activities that were available at the time they took the class. Similarly staff can view session by session archives of the class as it was in previous sessions.

It was directed by Michael J. Jacobs, and stars Dylan Patton, Edward Asner, Judge Reinhold, Sarah Ryder, Kathy Patrick, and Ruby Handler. During production, the film's working title was Crab Orchard. It was known as Angel Dog 2 when released on DVD in the UK in 2013. Story Sheeba is the tale of a young boy named Clay Thomas (Patton) from New York City whose parents have become estranged after the events of 9-11. His mother (Handler) elects to move them away from his firefighter father (Reinhold) to live in the country with Clay's grandfather (Asner). At first, a lonesome Clay initially struggles to fit in and make friends in the rural community, but he eventually gets into a fight with a troublemaking teenager named Wax at school and is expelled as a result. A bitter Clay is confronted by his grandfather and mother for his actions, but after learning about what had happened, Clay’s mother takes him back to school and the principal gives Clay another chance on the condition that he doesn’t start another fight in school again. Despite a difficult start in adjusting to a new school and trying to make friends, Clay soon finds comfort and friendship with his new dog, a border collie named Sheeba. He also makes friends with two of the kids from his school, a girl named Kristen and a boy named Amir. When bitter tensions between Clay and Wax mount, Clay finds himself in some serious trouble. Wax eventually steals Sheeba and takes the dog to his father’s land, but when Clay arrives to get his dog back, they are both chased off and separated when Wax shoots Sheeba in the left hind leg with his father’s rifle. As his parents reunite together and join forces with the rest of the community to find Clay, Clay spends the next two days in the remote countryside searching for his missing dog. He eventually finds Sheeba, wounded but alive, and the two of them seek refuge in an abandoned barn. Unbeknownst to either of them, Wax secretly follows them undetected, sets fire to the barn, and locks them up inside. Sheeba eventually escapes and runs off to find help, but Clay remains trapped inside the burning barn. Fortunately for Clay, Sheeba returns with his parents, friends, and an armed force of policemen and firefighters to rescue Clay and put out the fire. Clay watches with relief and joy as his parents decide to get back together again as a family, while he makes peace with his friends Kristen and Amir. Sheeba is hailed as a hero by the community for her bravery and undying loyalty to Clay and his family. A few days later, the police inform Clay and his parents that Wax had just been arrested after admitting to starting the fire and trying to kill Clay and Sheeba. Wax’s father was also arrested for committing a number of unsolved crimes around the community after Wax revealed this secret information during his interview at the police station. With Wax and his father in prison and his family reunited at last, Clay is able to enjoy a comfortable life in the rural community with his family, friends, and his faithful dog Sheeba.

The station at Muskrat Falls will have a capacity of over 824 MW and provide 4.9 TWh of electricity per year. A $6.2 billion deal between Newfoundland and Labrador's Nalcor Energy and Halifax-based Emera to develop the project was announced in November 2010. The project is more than $6 billion over budget and two years late as of 2019. Projected cost overruns exceeding 70% from C$7.4B to C$12.7B, poor planning, lack of engineering experience, and related assumptions that were invalid, misleading or later turned out to be incorrect have led to Nalcor CEO Stan Marshall declaring the project a boondoggle. Premier Dwight Ball called for a public inquiry into the project that started in September 2018. Technical plan=Generation Reservoir impoundment was completed in 2019 with the flooding of 41 km2 of land to create the 101 km2 reservoir. Containment is by a two-part concrete dam totalling 757 metres long. This will power an 834 MW generating station. Transmission Power will be transmitted to the island of Newfoundland via a 2.1 billion dollar high- voltage direct current line. The total length is to be 1,100 km, of which 30 km are submarine power cables under the Strait of Belle Isle. Construction began in 2014 and ended in 2018. Power will be further transmitted from Stephenville on the island of Newfoundland to Nova Scotia via a 180 km sub-sea line to Point Aconi on Cape Breton Island. Construction is a 1.2 billion dollar joint venture between Nalcor and Emera (the now-privatized Nova Scotia Power). The link came online in December 2017. Once on the island of Newfoundland and the mainland of the Maritimes, power will be distributed via the existing grid. Emera hopes to sell surplus power via a proposed 563 km underwater transmission line from New Brunswick to Massachusetts. Environmental impact Researchers from Harvard University found that methylmercury levels in fish would rise as a result of the project. After protests led by Indigenous groups in Central Labrador in 2016, an Agreement was reached by Labrador’s three Indigenous groups (Nunatsiavut Government, Innu Nation and the NunatuKavut Community Council) and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador outlining the establishment of an independent committee to make recommendations on mitigating potential impacts of methylmercury on human health from the Lower Churchill Project at Muskrat Falls, Labrador.

Individual terror vs. political assassination Many authors do not draw distinction between types of political assassinations and furthermore, and there is no full consensus on the issue.Political assassinations by Jews: a rhetorical device for justice By Nachman Ben-Yehuda, , 1993, Ze'ev Iviansky attempted to draw a distinction as follows. While revolutionary individual terror and traditional political assassination share the common goal, a major political change, they differ in various aspects: tactics, methods, role, view on the society, and significance of an individual act. Most of the differences stem from the immediate purpose of an individual act. In traditional political assassination the target of the killing is a central political figure, such as the king or dictator, whose removal would give way to political changes, and as such the choice of the target is of primary importance. The ultimate goal is to hit the regime represented by the target. Whereas in individual terror, the choice of the target, while important, is secondary to the primary goal, which is to bring the attention of the public to a political movement and to promote the political movement. This key distinction explains differences in tactics. While traditional political assassination may well be clandestine, the efficiency of revolutionary individual terror in a greater extent depends on the publicity of the act. The target of a political assassination is usually a very specific individual, while the target of an act of terrorism is not. David C. Rapoport (1971) drew the difference as follows: \\"...the assassin destroys men who are corrupting the system, while the terrorist destroys a system which has already corrupted everyone it touches...\\" History The roots of individual terror as revolutionary tactics lie in the second half of the 19th century in Europe. Part of its theoretical base was \\"propaganda by deed\\" put forth by the ideologists of anarchism. Different revolutionary parties had different attitude to individual terror, for political, tactical, moral, and other reasons.

The film follows Matt Weston (Reynolds), a CIA agent on his first low-level posting in Cape Town who is in charge of a safe house where the CIA is interrogating Tobin Frost (Washington), a veteran operative who has allegedly betrayed the agency. When the safe house is attacked by mercenaries who kill almost all the agents, Weston flees with Frost in his charge, and they end up on the run. As the team of killers, who seem to be one step ahead of the pair, track them throughout Cape Town, Weston begins to wonder whom to trust. The film was released on February 10, 2012, in North America by Universal Pictures. Filming took place in Cape Town, South Africa. The film premiered in New York City on February 7, 2012, and was released in U.S. theaters on February 10, 2012. While Washington and Reynolds' performances were praised, the film received mixed reviews. The film earned $208 million worldwide against its $85 million budget. Plot In Cape Town, South Africa, CIA agent Matt Weston complains to his handler, David Barlow, that he should’ve been reassigned by now, as it’s been a year, and he has been hoping to move up the ladder (preferably to Paris with his girlfriend). Barlow puts him off, saying perhaps in four months he may be able to get him something. Elsewhere in Cape Town, ex-CIA NOC operative turned international criminal Tobin Frost acquires a data storage device from rogue MI6 agent Alec Wade. A team of mercenaries attacks them and kills Wade. Frost flees and, out of options, surrenders to the American consulate. Frost is transferred to a local CIA safe house where Weston is a “housekeeper”. A team led by veteran Daniel Kiefer is sent to interrogate Frost and bring him back to the US. Weston watches uneasily as Kiefer's team waterboards Frost. The mercenaries, led by Vargas, attack the safe house and kill Kiefer and his team. Weston escapes with Frost. Weston contacts his superior, David Barlow, at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, along with Catherine Linklater, the operative in charge of Frost's interrogation and Kiefer's superior, and CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford, who is overseeing the operation. Linklater orders Weston to lay low and await further instructions. Frost begins to manipulate Weston, insisting that someone within the CIA gave away their location to the mercenaries and that Weston will be forced to take the fall if things go wrong. Weston contacts his girlfriend Ana, giving her a cover story that his office has been threatened and suggesting she stay with friends when it appears their apartment is under surveillance. Barlow tells Weston to go to Cape Town Stadium where he retrieves a GPS device containing the location of another safe house, but Frost creates a diversion and escapes. Weston, detained by the police, escapes and is forced to fire at them. Weston contacts Langley to report Frost's escape. After hearing that Weston fired at the police, Linklater orders him to visit the nearest American embassy for debriefing. When Whitford tells him \\"we'll take it from here\\", Weston decides to pursue Frost himself as Frost had warned him that when he heard that phrase, that was when Weston should become concerned about his own safety. Linklater and Barlow go to South Africa themselves. En route, Linklater suggests that Weston has joined Frost, which Barlow refutes. Weston meets with Ana and admits he is in the CIA, urging her to return to Paris for her medical residency and to tell anyone who asks that they broke up weeks ago in order to protect her. Weston tracks Frost to a shantytown in Langa, where Frost meets Carlos Villar, an old friend and forger who provides him with travel documents but suggests that he leave his life of crime behind. Vargas' team attacks again, killing Carlos and his family, but Weston helps Frost escape. Weston brutally interrogates one of Vargas' wounded mercenaries, who reveals that Vargas is working for the CIA, which is seeking to retrieve the storage device from Frost. As they bandage their wounds, Frost tells the story of how he was forced to kill an air traffic controller while on a mission. He later learned that he was simply part of a plot to assassinate a whistle-blower who would expose wetwork committed by the CIA. Weston takes Frost to the new safe house, where Weston keeps the housekeeper, Keller, at gunpoint. Keller attacks and severely wounds Weston before Weston kills him. Frost reveals the device contains evidence of corruption and bribery involving the CIA, MI6, and other intelligence agencies. Frost leaves Weston, who passes out from blood loss. Meanwhile, Linklater arrives in South Africa and informs Barlow of the device's existence, but not its contents. Barlow kills her and travels to the safe house where he reveals that he is Vargas' employer. He confirms that the file contains incriminating evidence against him, and encourages Weston to lie about what has happened. Frost returns and kills Vargas' team but is fatally wounded by Barlow. Weston then shoots and kills Barlow. As he dies, Frost gives Weston the file. Back in the United States, Weston meets with Director Whitford, who informs Weston that unflattering facts about the CIA must be removed from his report, but that he will be promoted. He asks Weston about the file's location but Weston denies knowing about it. Whitford states that whoever has those files will have many enemies. Weston assures Whitford that he will \\"take it from here,“ visibly shaking Whitford, and leaves. He leaks the files to the media, incriminating personnel from many intelligence agencies, including Whitford. Weston travels to Paris and covertly observes Ana while she sits with friends in a cafe. She notices him across the street and smiles before he walks away, content that she is safe.

They found that it could produce an earthquake measuring up to magnitude 7.5 and that two past large earthquakes likely took place on the fault around 7,000 and 4,000 years ago. The fault is long, and runs near Stanley, Idaho and Redfish Lake. Future earthquakes could be felt as far as Boise.

The fact that his imprisonment cost the town far more than the town would have recovered from his tax had he paid it made the case a contentious one. Smith wrote of his civil disobedience: > I am not a citizen of the United States, and consequently am taxed without > representation, which is quite contrary to the genius of republican > institutions.

A post office in Albany opened on 14 October 1834, and the main post office moved to Perth in 1835. First stamps The colony issued its first postage stamp on 1 August 1854. The 1d black stamp featured the black swan, a design used for most of the colony's later stamps as well. This stamp was engraved in England and printed by Perkins Bacon; later in the year, local lithographer Horace Samson produced 4d and 1sh values by taking an impression of the 1d's swan vignette and adding different frames. Alfred Hillman's mistake in the repair of the printing stones in 1855 resulted in the frame being inverted, yielding the extremely rare Inverted Swan error. Later issues In 1857, Hillman produced 2d and 6d values of the swan design by imitating the existing stamps, though with the swan on a blank background, but these were only used until 1860, when Perkins Bacon plates of the 1854 design were used in Perth to print all values. A new swan design, for the 3d value, appeared in 1872, and variations on it finally superseded the 1854 design starting in 1885, with a definitive series of eight values. After federation, the states continued to operate their own postal systems, and 1902 saw a new series of swan definitives, along with stamps depicting Queen Victoria for the first time, on the values from 2 shillings to 1 pound. The Victoria stamps are also unusual in having the inscription read \\"WEST AUSTRALIA\\" instead of \\"WESTERN AUSTRALIA\\" as was the norm. These stamps continued in daily use until Commonwealth stamps were issued in 1913.

The West Suriname Plan is an economic development plan for the western part of Suriname. As originally conceived, it consists among others of the mining of bauxite in the Bakhuis Mountains, the building of a hydroelectric power plant on the Kabalebo River, and the construction of a harbour and an aluminium smelter at Apoera. The plan was the brainchild of former Surinamese Minister of Development .Trouw.nl - Roemrucht plan West-Suriname herleeft Overview In 1963, Operation Grasshopper found bauxite deposits in the Bakhuis Mountains. Two years later, extensive explorations were conducted by and Billiton.

False start The Dutch government agreed to help execute the plan as part of the development subsidies to be given after Suriname would gain independence in 1975. Between 1976 and 1978, a railroad track was constructed between Apoera and the Bakhuis Mountains by Morrison-Knudsen as main contractor and local companies as sub contractors. After the 1980 Surinamese coup d'état Dutch development funds were frozen, and the project was halted. Low bauxite market prices in the 1980s also led to doubts about the economic feasibility of the project.

Developed and tested during 1942 and 1943, the design proved moderately successful, but development of improved drones saw the TDN-1 relegated to second-line duties, and none were used in operational service. Design and development The development of the radar altimeter and television in the early 1940s made remotely guided bomb- or torpedo-carrying aircraft a practical proposition.Parsch 2005 In January 1942, the Naval Aircraft Factory was instructed to initiate the development of such an aircraft, with a go- ahead for prototype construction being given in February.Naval Aviation News, Volume 55 (January 1973). p.12.

The improved Interstate TDR was selected for development as an alternative, the majority of TDN-1s being used in the test, liaison and training roles, with some being expended as aerial targets.

He had his first exhibition of oil paintings in Paris at the Galerie Mouninou on the Rue Marbeuf. Watercolour became Barr's main medium around 1939. He focused on painting nature.

The 1980 Surinamese coup d'état, usually referred to as the Sergeants' Coup (), was a military coup in Suriname which occurred on 25 February 1980, when a group of 16 sergeants () of the Surinamese Armed Forces (SKM) led by Dési Bouterse overthrew the government of Prime Minister Henck Arron with a violent coup d'état. This marked the beginning of the military dictatorship that dominated the country from 1980 until 1991. The dictatorship featured the presence of an evening curfew, the lack of freedom of press, a ban on political parties (from 1985), a restriction on the freedom of assembly, a high level of government corruption and the summary executions of political opponents. Background The Netherlands granted Suriname independence on 25 November 1975. It was marked by social unrest, economic depression, and rumors of corruption. The hastily- created Suriname National Army had many non-commissioned officers who tried to unionize and complained about corruption and poor pay. President Henck Arron refused to recognise them and arrested the ringleaders, who were to go to trial on 26 February 1980. Elections were also scheduled for March 1980. Coup President Johan Ferrier was eventually forced out of office in August 1980, and several months after the coup d'état by Bouterse, most of the political authority transferred to the military leadership. Until 1988, the titular presidents were essentially army-installed by Bouterse, who ruled as a de facto leader with few practical checks on his power. December murders and Moiwana massacre On 8 December 1982, a group of fifteen academics, journalists, lawyers, union leaders and military officials who opposed the military rule in Suriname were snatched from their beds and brought to Fort Zeelandia in Paramaribo, where they were tortured and executed by Bouterse's soldiers. Fourteen of those executed were Surinamese, and the journalist Frank Wijngaarde was a Dutch national. The events are known as the December murders. In 1986 Bouterse's soldiers killed at least 39 citizens, mostly children and women, of the Maroon village of Moiwana, as part of the Suriname Guerrilla War, which was fought between the soldiers of Bouterse and the Jungle Commando led by Ronnie Brunswijk. Transition to democratic rule Elections were held in 1987 and a new constitution was adopted, which allowed Bouterse to remain in charge of the army. Dissatisfied with the government, Bouterse overthrew them on 24 December 1990 during another coup. The event became popularly known as \\"the telephone coup.\\" In 1991, elections returned to Suriname, and the New Front party gained 41 of the 51 parliament seats. Ronald Venetiaan, a fierce opponent of Bouterse, became president. In 1996, Jules Wijdenbosch was elected as president of Suriname on behalf of Bouterse's party, the National Democratic Party (NDP). In 2000 and 2005, Ronald Venetiaan was elected as president of Suriname. Dési Bouterse returned to power as president in 2010. National holiday Monument commemorating the coup. After becoming president of Suriname, Bouterse designated February 25, the anniversary of the day of the coup d’état, as a national holiday. On the day of the coup, Bouterse's soldiers burned down the Central Police Station of Suriname. The remains of the building now form the Monument of the Revolution, and every year on 25 February, the coup is commemorated there.

Early life Quick was born in Plymouth. After graduating at Oxford in 1657 he was ordained at Ermington in Devon in 1659. A more famous contemporary John Flavel (1628–91) ministered at nearby Dartmouth. He served at Kingsbridge and then at Brixton near Plymouth.Quick, John (1636-1706). Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900. London: Smith, Elder & Co  Imprisonment  Undeterred by the Act of Uniformity (1662), he continued to preach. He was arrested during a service on 13 December 1663 and imprisoned at Exeter. At his trial, he was nearly acquitted on a technicality, but since he refused to give up preaching, he was sent to prison. After eight weeks, he was liberated by Sir Matthew Hale. The Bishop of Exeter, Seth Ward, then prosecuted Quick for preaching to the prisoners but he was acquitted. Charles II’s Royal Declaration of Indulgence of 1672 brought a brief respite for the persecuted Puritan brotherhood. Quick was licensed to preach at Plymouth. When restrictions were imposed again the following year, he was imprisoned for three months with other nonconformists at the Marshalsea prison in Plymouth. On his release, Quick left the west of England for London. He then traveled to the Dutch Republic where he became a minister to the English church at Middelburg in 1679. Returning to London two years later, Quick gathered a Presbyterian congregation in a small meeting house in Middlesex Court, Bartholomew Close and Smithfield. On the eve of easier times, his London ministry “successful to the conversion of many,” says Edmund CalamyAn Account of the Ministers...Ejected or Silenced after the Restoration in 1660, 2nd edition (London, 1713), ii. 333 was relatively undisturbed; the Glorious Revolution and the Toleration Act of 1688-89 eventually brought persecution to an end. Known as “a serious, good preacher” with a “great facility and freedom in prayer,” John Quick continued to serve his people faithfully until his death on 29 April 1706. His wife Elizabeth died in 1708. Their only daughter became the wife of Dr. John Evans (c. 1680-1730) who completed the Matthew Henry's commentary on the Epistle to the Romans.J. B. Williams, Memoirs of..the Revd. (London, 1828; fac. rep. Edinburgh, 1974), 308 Publications Quick was author of the Synodicon in Gallia Reformata - a collection of liturgical texts used by the Huguenots in late 17th-century England. During his early ministry, he became acquainted with the Huguenot refugees, some of whom landed at Plymouth from La Rochelle in 1681—the year the dragonnades began. Quick's interest in the Huguenots did not end with the Synodicon. Besides published sermons of his own, he also prepared for publication a selection of fifty brief biographies of eminent pastors, theologians, and martyrs of the French Reformed Church, the Icones Sacrae Gallicanae.For the complete list, see Proceedings of the Huguenot Society, 2 (London, 1887-88), 257-9 He also produced a similar selection of twenty Puritans, the Icones Sacrae Anglicanae.See A. H. Drysdale, History of the Presbyterians in England (London, 1889), 468. In June 1694, Quick approached Matthew Henry for biographical material for his project. In a letter to his “venerable father,” dated 26 June, Henry wrote: “Last Friday, Mr Quick, of London, Minister, author of the Synodicon, came to my house, recommended to me by Sir Henry Ashurst. He tells me he hath now under hand a book which he calls Icones, intending an account of the lives of eminent ministers, our own and foreigners, never yet written: he casts for four volumes in folio, and obligeth me to furnish him with what memoirs I can get concerning any in this country. I refer further talk of it till I can see you” (J. B.Williams, op. cit. 238) These ambitious ventures failed with the death in 1700 of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford (the dedicatee of the Synodicon) who had offered to assist with the cost. Advancing illness also prevented Quick from collecting subscriptions for the work.See “Translated Abstracts from the Act Book of the Consistory of the Threadneedle Street [French] Church, 1693- 1708,” entry for 6 March 1702-3: “M. Quick returned the 25s paid him as subscription for the book called Icones which he proposed to give to the public, his indisposition compelling him to refrain from printing it” (Proceedings 7 [1901-4], 40. Following the Quick's death, the manuscript volumes were eventually deposited at Dr. Williams's Library in London.

The company was established in 1998 and has been owned by Mark and David Samworth since 2017. History The West Cornish Pasty Company was launched in 1998 by Ken Cocking, a serial entrepreneur, along with his sons, Arron and Gavin, and Mark Christophers. The first store was opened in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and the firm was initially financed by family and friends. After nine years, Cockings sold the company to its management for £40 million in October 2007. At the time, the company had four hundred staff in 55 establishments of various types. By July 2013, it was reported to employ around 450 staff in eighty locations, including eighteen in London. The pasty was originally a portable meal of meat and potatoes in a pastry case, made for tin miners in Cornwall to take underground. The modern range has expanded to include lamb and minted peas, chicken, and spicy chorizo. In April 2014, the private equity house Gresham, the owners of the company, put it into administration, blaming its failure on the government's decision to charge VAT on pasties. The company was subsequently sold to another private equity fund, Endless, backed by Danny Mills, former Leeds United F.C. and England footballer, and others. Losses were reduced by expanding the company's range and by taking a more targeted approach, concentrating on outlets such as railway stations and sports venues. The firm boosted the range of own brand coffees that it sells, to try to get each customer to spend more in each transaction. Endless sold the business in 2017 to Samworth Brothers, who already owned the Ginsters pasty brand. At that time there were 33 shops and 19 franchises at motorway service stations. The company states that its pasties are still made in west Cornwall. In what was described as a temporary measure, all the company's shops closed in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is contrasted with abolitionism, the position that human beings have no moral right to use animals, and ought to have no legal right, no matter how the animals are treated.Introduction, Francione and Garner 2010, pp. x–xi. Animal protectionists agree with abolitionists that the animal welfare model of animal protection—whereby animals may be used as food, clothing, entertainment and in experiments so long as their suffering is regulated—has failed ethically and politically, but argue that its philosophy can be reformulated. Robert Garner of the University of Leicester, a leading academic protectionist, argues that animal use may in some circumstances be justified, though it should be better regulated, and that the pursuit of better treatment and incremental change is consistent with holding an abolitionist ideology. Gary Francione, professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark and a leading abolitionist, calls this approach \\"new welfarism.\\" He regards it as counter- productive because it wrongly persuades the public that the animals they use are being treated kindly, and that continued use is therefore justifiable. Francione regards the abolitionist position as the only one that can properly be called animal rights.Francione, Gary. \\"The Abolition of Animal Exploitation,\\" in Francione and Garner 2010, p. 1. __TOC__ Arguments One of the arguments put forward by abolitionists against protectionism is that small improvements in animal welfare serve to salve consciences by persuading the public that their use of animals is not unethical. Welfare reform can therefore be counter-productive. Abolitionists also argue that real reform is invariably unsuccessful, because industries that depend on animal use will not implement change that harms their profit margin. That is, the property status of animals prohibits reform that will harm their owners' interests. For that reason, abolitionists argue, it is the property status of animals that must be removed.Garner, Robert. \\"A Defense of a Broad Animal Protectionism,\\" in Francione and Garner 2010, pp. 120–121. Robert Garner argues against this that welfare reform is not simply a staging post on the way to abolition, but is in itself desirable. An approach that is based on the right of animals not to suffer could, in theory, be satisfied with a welfare system in which animal suffering, if not animal use, was minimized, though he concedes that this is unlikely. He also argues that Francione has not shown that improvements in welfare persuade the public that all is well. Rather, he argues, reform has the effect of raising public consciousness about the interests of animals.Garner 2010, pp. 122–123. NotesReferences *Francione, Gary L. and Garner, Robert.

One of Mississippi’s original Independent Negro League's charter franchises, the club was founded in 1932 by Dayton Hair. Negro Leaguers such as Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, Piper Davis, Lester Lockett, Artie Wilson and Ed Steele are among the many players to play for the Black Cats. Games were held on Sundays always starting at 3:00 pm so that fans could attend after church. From the 1930s to the 60s, the Black Cats home ballpark was Rahaim Park, located in the KC Community. In the 1990s, they moved to the Queensburg Community, where they currently remain today. The Black Cats have achieved widespread popularity and a dedicated fan base. Their rivalry with the Hattiesburg Black Sox is arguably the fiercest and most historic in the state of Mississippi semi- pro baseball. After sending several players to college and other Negro League franchises, the team was disbanded in 2006 but later returned in 2010 when former Jones County Jr. College assistant baseball coach Jody P. Babineaux took ownership and management of the club. In 2016 the team won a state championship. Origins In 1932, a local African American businessman by the name of Dayton Hair, whose business enterprises included real estate, insurance, rental collection agency, the Black Cat Inn and the Black Cat Taxi Service, ventured in sports by bringing James “Lefty” Bell to Laurel from Livingston, Alabama, and together they organized the Laurel Black Cats Baseball team. Hair drew players from all over the south exclusively to showcase their playing talent. He put together a formidable collection of all-black talent, including pitcher James “Lefty” Bell who established himself as one of the most popular stars of the Independent Negro League. Immediate contenders, the Black Cats became bitter rivals to the Hattiesburg Black Sox. Managed by A.W. Watson In the 1940s and 50s, manager Author \\"A.W.\\" Watson took over as player/manager. He kept up the Black Cat's tradition, as the team's staff over the next few years featured James \\"Lefty\\" Bell, Willie McNeil, Walter Charles “W.C.“ Crosby, W.P. Noble, A.D. Chamber, Joe Grace,Edward Payton, Bombet Boston, J.D. Lewis, Hack Afterberry,Afonso Dunn and Ted Nicholson who was selected 3rd in the Major League Baseball Draft. Under the management of Watson, the Black Cats spent several years as an independent team, mostly barnstorming throughout the south. As baseball gradually desegregated in the late 1940s and 1950s, the Black Cats developed a niche as the foremost developer of black talent for local colleges and professional baseball teams. They frequently had players that toured with Negro League franchises such as the Kansas City Monarchs, Birmingham Black Barons, and Memphis Red Sox and in the 1969 Major League Baseball Draft had a player by the name of Ted Nicholson selected 3rd overall pick by the Chicago White Sox. Managed by W.C. Jones After decades of winning seasons, Watson step down as manager due to personal illness. In honor of A.W. Watson years of managing the club the City of Laurel named the field in Queensburg after him. “A.W. Watson Field.” W.C. Jones who played for Watson succeeded as manager of the team. Under the leadership of Jones the team continued the tradition of barnstorming throughout the south posting winning seasons each year. Though the Jackson Metro Baseball League (JMBL) had begun to form in the state, Jones kept the Black Cats as an independent team playing local community teams such as Bay Springs, MS, Heidelberg,MS, Paulding,MS, and Meridian, MS. After remaining rivals with the Hattiesburg Black Sox for half of a century, the rivalry would come to an end in under Jones due to a personal disagreement between Hattiesburg’s owner Trey Aby. W.C. Jones stayed at the helm through the 2005 season but later step down from running the club due to lack player participation and illness. The Laurel Black Cats ceased operations in 2006, but later returned in 2010 when former Jones County Jr. College assistant baseball coach Jody P. Babineaux took ownership and management of the club.

Early life Vasily Mitrofanovich Shatilov was born on 17 February 1902 to a peasant family in the village of Kalmyk, Voronezh Governorate. Conscripted into the Red Army in May 1924, he was sent to the 8th Caucasian Rifle Regiment of the 3rd Caucasian Rifle Division at Leninakan as a Red Army man. Shatilov rose to assistant platoon commander in November of that year and became a cadet at the Tiflis Infantry School in September 1925. Upon his graduation from the school in September 1928, he was posted to the 56th Rifle Regiment of the 19th Rifle Division at Bobrov, with which he served for the next seven years. Initially a rifle platoon commander, Shatilov successively became a regimental school platoon commander, company commander and political officer, and assistant battalion chief of staff. Shatilov was sent to receive advanced training at the Frunze Military Academy in April 1935, and following his graduation from its motorization and mechanization department in September 1938 was appointed assistant chief of staff of the 10th Tank Brigade of the Belorussian Special Military District at Borisov. Serving as chief of staff of the new 46th Light Tank Brigade from 19 August 1939, he participated with it in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Shatilov transferred to become chief of staff of the 27th Separate Light Tank Brigade at Riga, commanded by Colonel Ivan Chernyakhovsky, in April 1940 and then held the same position with the 196th Rifle Division of the Odessa Military District from March 1941. Soviet-German War After Operation Barbarossa began, Shatilov and his division fought in the border battles and in the Battle of Kiev. The 196th was encircled on 23 September and destroyed. Shatilov reached Soviet lines with a group of eight others on 3 October in the area of Shishaki north of Khorol, still armed and in possession of his documents. Then he was transferred to the same post in the Dnipropetrovsk-based 196th Rifle Division, under General Konstantin Kulikov, not long before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. When Kulikov was ambushed and taken prisoner in September, Shatilov replaced him.Berlin was So Far Away, Part I, Chapter 9. Appointed chief of staff of the 200th Rifle Division, forming and training in the South Ural Military District at Buzuluk, in January 1942, Shatilov was sent with the unit to the Northwestern Front in March and April. After joining the 11th Army of the front, the division fought in the Demyansk Offensive, then defended positions on the Lovat. By now a colonel, he was appointed commander of the 182nd Rifle Division on 30 August 1942. The division defended positions northeast of Staraya Russa as part of the 27th Army until late 1942 and in February 1943 fought in the second Demyansk Offensive, breaking through to the Porusye River and capturing Goroshkovo. Withdrawn to the 34th Army reserve in May, the 182nd returned to action on 18 February with the 1st Shock Army of the 2nd Baltic Front during the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive and fought in the attack on Dretino. Pursuing the retreating German troops, Shatilov's division reached Dno on 23 February and recaptured the city, for which it received the name of the city as an honorific. Shatilov took command of the 150th Rifle Division, which he led for the rest of the war, on 30 April 1944. As part of the 79th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Shock Army of the front, the division fought in the Rezhitsa–Dvinsk Offensive and the Madona Offensive, in which it captured Sebezh and Idritsa. The 150th received the name of the latter as an honorific and in late 1944 with the corps and army fought in the Baltic Offensive and the Riga Offensive. With its corps and army, the 150th was transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front in late December for the Vistula–Oder Offensive. After the end of the latter, the division participated in the East Pomeranian Offensive in early 1945, in which it was decorated for its role in the capture of Stargard. Battle of Berlin On 16 April 1945, the Division crossed the Oder in the vicinity of Wriezen, reaching Berlin on the 21. It was tasked with hoisting the Victory Banner on the Reichstag.

He studied at the University of Otago and trained with the Otago Nuggets' academy while based in Dunedin. NBL career Wheeler was a member of the inaugural Southland Sharks team in 2010, making his NBL debut in the Sharks' opening game before making two other appearances off the bench. Following an incident in Dunedin on 27 March 2010, he was suspended from playing or practising with the Sharks for the rest of the NBL season. In September 2010, Wheeler was sentenced in the Dunedin District Court to seven months' home detention after admitting a charge of reckless disregard for safety when he struck a man in the face with a beer bottle at a Dunedin flat-warming party in March.

As a result, Wheeler became the only Sharks player to be part of all three of the franchise's championships. In 2019, Wheeler returned to the Sharks for a ninth season.

The building had been declining over the years and it was slated for demolition when a part of the building collapsed on August 9, 2009. The building was torn down later that year. Architecture The Colonel Young Block was a three-story, nine bay, brick building that was built on a stone foundation. Its decorative elements were found in the tall narrow windows and their projecting hoods. When it was built it featured an ornate cornice that was removed in later years. A skim coat application had been applied to the exterior. The building's original three-bay storefronts were altered with a permastone covering.

Therefore, a player should always have a listing under at least two years — for instance, a player making his debut in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, will have '2011–12' after his name. This follows general practice in expressing sporting seasons. In bold: players who have played at least one Eredivisie game in the (2016–17) season, and the clubs they have played for. They include players who have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of an Eredivisie club who have not played an Eredivisie game in the current season.

M. Stirling's alternate history series The Domination. The anthology was released in the United States on October 31, 2000. Contents=Custer Under the Baobab Written by: William Sanders Centurion George Armstrong Custer, former Lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, was dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Army for cowardice in battle for not attacking a group of Sioux. He finds himself in the Dominion of Draka, where he is brought into the Kalahari Mounted Police by J.E.B. Stuart and he is asked to do a final mission, he is ordered to hunt down a group of bushmen who have killed a white Draka farmer with a lochos consisting of old Confederate soldiers. Hewn in Pieces for the Lord Written by John J. Miller Charles George Gordon, once field marshal in both the Ottoman Empire and China, finds himself in Draka controlled Alexandria, where he tries to achieve The Plan, a plan to dam the Nile river and make it the longest navigable waterway in the world, and in order to do so seeks help from the prominent Alexander von Shrakenberg. Alexander von Shrakenberg provides him with a counter offer, defeat the rebellious Madhi in Sudan, who recently defeated William Hicks' army, and he will make sure Gordon can start his project. Gordon agrees to return to the area he once brought under Ottoman government rule, only to learn he has to find Madhi before his rival, William Quantrill of the Security Directorate, does. Written by the Wind Written by Roland J. Green During the Russo- Japanese War, a pair of Draka observers on a Japanese airship are witness to a brutal sea battle. The Tradesmen Written by David Drake After the end of the Eurasian War (the timeline's version of World War II), a rural Draka outpost in Europe is home to several mercenaries who 'clean up' what remains of the free locals and get paid for every ear of a killed person. In the commander's office, a change of protocol and a coincidence out in the field bring strong personalities against one another in terrible ways, over the debate if killing a child should gain the same reward as for an adult or only a partial payment. The Big Lie Written by Jane Lindskold Narrated by a sniper who supposedly served with Centurion Von Shrakenberg during the Eurasian War, it is a retelling of the main events of \\"Marching Through Georgia\\" with a decidedly cynical and less propagandistic tone. The Greatest Danger Written by Lee Allred In the Channel Islands, recently passed from Nazi rule to that of the Draka, a relatively enlightened Draka governor tries to avert the inevitable enslavement in store for the islands' British inhabitants. The story discloses that the Dutch-descended Africaners, marginalized by the Draka influx into their country, concentrate in the Draka Navy and tend to be a bit dissident in Draka society. A Draka propaganda film shown during the story documents the terrible fate of the Danish Royal Family, enslaved in a particularly brutal and humiliating manner in order to \\"set an example\\" to all newly made serfs of the Draka. Home is Where the Heart Is Written by William Barton A Nazi nuclear scientist, kidnapped from Germany after the Eurasian War, seeks to make a life after having been given Draka citizenship. It proves difficult in language, ethics and home life. The story jumps between his field tests of intercontinental missiles and his purchase of, and subsequent domestic encounters with, a serf woman. The story includes the obvious anachronism (from the point of view of our history) of an auction in the slave market in which payment is made with a credit card. The Last Word Written by Harry Turtledove It is after the nuclear exchange of the Final War and the Draka are landing troops in North Carolina. A group of U.S. military survivors hiding out in an underground bunker in the Appalachian Mountains seek to make the conquest as hard as possible. The story follows Navy Commodore Anson MacDonald as his partisan group makes their last stand against the Draka. The title has a double meaning. On a literal level, it presents the last stand of any organized resistance to the Draka. In the end MacDonald is cornered, however, and right before biting into a cyanide capsule disguised as false tooth (to avoid being tortured), he pronounced a defiant \\"last word\\" to the Draka: they may have conquered all of Earth, but failed to defeat the Alliance's holdings in the outer solar system. Soon the Alliance survivors will leave on an interstellar starship to colonize the Alpha Centauri system. One of the reasons that the Draka pressed the Final War was because even their leadership realized they were doomed to fall behind the Alliance technologically in the long-term: the Draka made some short term advances in the past few generations by ruthlessly exploiting any human resources in their domains, but in the long-term, the rate of scientific advancement in their slavery-based society will stagnate. The Draka cannot hope to achieve interstellar spaceflight capability for generations, while the Alliance colonists safely at Alpha Centauri will rebuild, outpace them technologically, and generations in the future return to take back Earth. A Walk in the Park Written by Anne Marie Talbott A woman in our timeline has read the Draka novels, and is surprised to see a pair of very Draka-looking individuals walking in the park one day. They turn out to be truly Draka, and an actual encounter with them is far less pleasant than reading the books. Hunting the Snark Written by Markus Baur A computer scientist working on a face recognition program discovers an anomaly with the results of the analysis of the video stream from a mall. He investigates and finds a bit more than he expected. Upon Their Backs, to Bite 'Em Written by John Barnes Barnes' own Timeline Wars series had its specific set of nasty villains, coming from a timeline where Carthago won its wars with the Romans. In the crossover story featured here, Barnes' protagonists hatch and carry out the Machiavellian scheme of siccing their own foes and the Draka on each other, in the hope that the two would keep each other busy for a long time - to the relief of everybody else. The Peaceable Kingdom Written by Severna Park Doctor Hamilton Guye is a psychiatrist working for the Baltimore Police. One day a man named Malik Raun is brought to him, a man of unknown origin and with odd dialect, a man who \\"show no fear for nothing\\" except one thing, something called Draka; and where can you find a place where white people speak English like West Africans?

Relations between the two are intrinsically tied because of the Portuguese Empire. They continue to be bound by a common language and ancestral lines in Portuguese Brazilians, which can be traced back hundreds of years. Today, Brazil and Portugal share a privileged relationship, as evidenced in aligned political and diplomatic coordination, as well as economic, social, cultural, legal, technical and scientific cooperation. According to a 2011 BBC poll, 76% of Portuguese people view Brazil's influence positively, with 8% viewing it negatively, the most favorable perception of Brazil for any other surveyed country in the world.Views of US Continue to Improve in 2011 BBC Country Rating Poll BBC History=Origins Cabral's landing in Porto Seguro, oil on canvas, Oscar Pereira da Silva, 1904. In April 1500, Brazil was claimed by Portugal on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral.Boxer, p. 98. Until 1530 Portugal had yet to establish their first colony in Brazil. In the first century of settlement, the Portuguese realized it would be difficult to use the natives as slave labor. They were not docile, had high mortality when exposed to Western diseases and could run away and hide rather easily. So Portugal turned to imported African slaves for manual labor. In the 16th and 17th centuries official revenue from Brazil was small — about 3 per cent of Portuguese public revenue in 1588 and 5 per cent in 1619.Bethell, p. 286. The economic activity was concentrated on a small population of settlers engaged in a highly profitable export–oriented sugarcane industry in the Northeast. In the 1690s, the discovery of gold, and in the 1720s diamonds further south in Minas Gerais, opened new opportunities. The gold industry was at its peak around 1750, with production around 15 tons a year, but as the best deposits were exhausted, output and exports declined. In the first half of the 18th century profit remittances from gold averaged 5.23 million mil reis (£1.4 million) a year, of which the identifiable royal revenues were around 18 per cent.Alden, p. 31. Total Brazilian gold shipments over the whole of the 18th century were between 800 and 850 tons.Morineau, p. 354  Inconfidência Mineira  Tiradentes quartered under the reign of Dona Maria I of Portugal. The of 1788–1789, led by the patriot and revolutionary Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (popularly known as Tiradentes), was the first major movement against Portuguese rule in Brazil. It was triggered by taxes, including the detested or \\"royal fifth,\\" a 20% tax on the gold produced. as well as the , an annual tax quota of 100 gold bars imposed on the state of Minas Gerais; if it was unmet, the Portuguese crown could force the Brazilian people to pay the remaining balance. Inspired by the American Revolution, the a group including military men, clergymen, poets, and intellectuals from Minas Gerais conspired to rise up in rebellion on the day the derrama was imposed, but three individuals informed the colonial government and the participants were arrested. The uprising failed and the conspirators were arrested. Tiradentes was drawn and quartered and his remains were sent to Vila Rica (Ouro Preto) to be displayed. United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves In 1808, the Portuguese ruler, Prince Regent John VI, fled to Rio de Janeiro to escape the French invasion of Portugal. He brought about 10,000 of the mainland establishment with him — the aristocracy, bureaucracy, and some of the military. For 13 years, Rio de Janeiro functioned as the capital of the Kingdom of Portugal in what some historians call a \\"metropolitan reversal\\"—i.e., a former colony exercising governance over the entirety of the Portuguese empire. In 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, John VI created the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, elevating Brazil to the same rank as Portugal and increasing the administrative independence of Brazil. Brazilian representatives were elected to the Portuguese Constitutional Courts. In 1816, with the death of Queen Maria, John VI was crowned King of Portugal and Brazil in Rio de Janeiro. John VI faced a political crisis when groups in Portugal tried to reverse the metropolitanisation of their former colony. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars came calls for John to return to Lisbon and for Brazil to return to its previous colonial condition. By late 1821 the situation was becoming unbearable and John VI and the royal family returned to Portugal. Independence of Brazil O Grito do Ipiranga, 1888. The Portuguese Courts then demanded that Prince Pedro return to Portugal. As his father had advised him to do, the prince instead declared his intention to stay in Brazil in a speech known as the \\"Fico\\" (\\"I am staying\\"). Pedro proclaimed Brazilian independence on September 7, 1822 and subsequently became the first emperor of the country. There was some armed resistance from Portuguese garrisons in Brazil, but the struggle was brief. Portugal recognised Brazil's independence in 1825. Revolta da Armada incident The Revolta da Armada in an illustration by Angelo Agostini. In 1894 relations were strained between the two states after Portugal granted refuge to Brazilian rebels after the Revolta da Armada incident. Portugal had sent a naval force constituted by the warships Mindello and Affonso de Albuquerque to Rio de Janeiro to protect Portuguese interests during the naval rebellion against President Floriano Peixoto. On 2 April 1894, the uprising was crushed and 493 rebels, including 70 officers and the mutiny leader, Admiral Luís Filipe de Saldanha da Gama, sought refuge on board the Portuguese warships. Despite protests from the Brazilian government, Portugal granted refuge to the rebels and sailed to the Rio de la Plata, where most of the refugees disembarked. The incident was regarded as a violation of Brazilian sovereignty and led Brazil to sever diplomatic relations with Portugal. Diplomatic relations were re-established in 1895 by the Prudente de Morais administration. 20th century In the 20th century, relations between the two countries were shaped by Brazil's much greater size and more powerful economy. For this reason, Brazilian investment in Portugal in the 1970s and 1980s was considerably greater than Portuguese investment in Brazil.Portugal: Brazil and East Timor U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved on 2011-10-16. Political ties Brazil and Portugal cooperate in multilateral fora, and have been partners in promoting U.N. reform. Portugal has lobbied for Brazil to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Brazil and Portugal are founding members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, an intergovernmental organization of former Portuguese colonies. Brazil and Portugal signed the Friendship, Cooperation and Consultation treaty in Porto Seguro on April 22, 2000, during the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil. This treaty regulates the cooperation of Portugal and Brazil in international fora, grants Brazilians in Portugal and Portuguese in Brazil equal rights under the Statute of Equality of Portuguese and Brazilians (Estatuto de igualdade entre portugueses e brasileiros); cultural, scientific, technological, economical, financial, commercial, fiscal, investment and several other forms of institutional cooperation were also addressed. In 2016, some memorandums were signed during the 12th Brazil-Portugal summit in Brasília, including on Antarctic cooperation. Lula and Portugal's Aníbal Cavaco Silva receive the Laurel de Gratidão at the Real Gabinete Português de Leitura in Rio de Janeiro, 2008. The two states hold regular summit meetings to discuss bilateral and multilateral agreements and current topics. A major issue on the bilateral agenda in cultural matters is the joint promotion and diffusion of the Portuguese language. Economic ties Both political and economic ties are important today. Companies from both countries were involved in mergers into the 2000s. Relations between the two countries was said to be based on Brazil's sheer size, thus its economic market and generally more powerful economy. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brazilian investment in Portugal was thus much greater than Portuguese investment in Brazil. In economic terms, Portugal's direct investment in Brazil has grown substantially, and there has also been steady growth in trade between the two nations. Cultural relations In addition to a commonality of language and religion, both countries are members of ACOLOP and are parts of the Lusophone world. Portugal is sometimes controversially called the \\"mother country\\" of Brazil. A statue of Pedro Alvares Cabral in Ibirapuera Park in São Paulo alleges that \\"Brazilians owe everything to Portugal.\\" Brazil's independence from Portugal in 1822 was said to be one of the important reasons for Portugal's decline as a global leader. The azulejos style of architecture prevalent in Brazil was derived from the era of Portuguese rule. Brazilian telenovelas are popular in Portugal. However, ethnic relations between the two were not strong and the \\"special relations\\" was said to have ended by the later 20th century, however, Portuguese citizens are still granted certain privileges under the Constitution that other foreigners do not have. A Portuguese community still exists in Brazil, as does a Brazilian community in Portugal. Portuguese is also said to have \\"united\\" Brazil where, in the 19th century, only segments of the country spoke the language with indigenous languages such as Tupi being prevalent. Following more settlers coming from Europe and African slaves, Portuguese became a universal language in the country. However, Portuguese links with Brazil were weaker than that of other European empires like the United Kingdom, whose colonies sent soldiers to fight in both World Wars. Cultural dissimalirites also exist because of the native and African influence, both of whom adopted Portuguese names but retained an element of their own culture and \\"indigenised\\" it to make a \\"uniquely\\" Brazilian culture as in dance and other facets. These were adopted by Brazil's white population, but was not present in Portugal. The two countries have also given special attention to the promotion and diffusion of the Portuguese language in the world. Brazil and Portugal have signed several bilateral agreements with the purpose of creating a unified orthography for the Portuguese language, to be used by all the countries that have Portuguese as their official language. Since 21 April 2000, Brazilian citizens can travel to Portugal (and vice versa) without a visa, on account of the \\"Status of Equality\\" treaty that was signed between the two states.

It was not usual in the 1920s for pilots to wear parachutes but he was given one in June 1926 with the instruction that it was to be used on all test flights. The following day he found himself in trouble when he had inverted an aircraft (a Vickers Wibault) and it would not right itself; he then used his newly acquired parachute and landed without injury. On 16 May 1929, Scholefield was killed when the aircraft crashed and burned at Shepperton on the shore of the River Thames. Scholefield and the Rolls-Royce aero-engine mechanic Frank. W. Sherratt were test flying the Vanguard airliner from Brooklands Aerodrome when control was lost and the aircraft nose-dived from 2,000 feet into the ground. Observers had seen something fluttering away from the tail just before the aircraft dived. Scholefield was killed in the burnt wreck, and Sherratt who had jumped from the aircraft died from the fall. Family life Scholefield had married Dorothy Seymour in 1919 and they had one son, Kenneth Rodolph Seymour in 1923.

Works are attributed to either the \\"Reed Painter\\" or his atelier. The vessels of the Reed Painter are typical of white-ground lekythoi in that they often focus on real people, in contrast to the earlier black-figure tradition that featured scenes of mythical figures pertaining to Dionysiac cult.Lawrence A. Tritle, A New History of the Peloponnesian War (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 49. The purpose of the lekythos is often reflected in its subject matter. This artist's most common theme is a scene depicting a visit to a tomb. The figures, usually a woman bringing offerings or a youth leaning on a spear, display quiet dignity rather than emotion. The tomb, topped by a pediment, provides important evidence for funerary monuments in Attica at the time. The artist takes his name from his characteristic use of reeds in the landscape, particularly in depictions of Charon, the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology.Peter Connor and Heather Jackson, A Catalogue of Greek Vases in the Collection of the University of Melbourne at the Ian Potter Museum of Art (University of Melbourne, 2000), p. 159. A lekythos by the Reed Painter is one of only a few white-figure examples that depict a horseman at a tomb; unusually, the youth sits at the tomb with his horse rather than riding it.John H. Oakley, \\"White Lekythoi from Gela,\\" in Ta Attika: Attic Figured Vases from Gela («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2003), p. 212. He may be an ephebe in training for the cavalry, as he wears the black cloak (chlamys) that was characteristic attire for the Athenian ephebe at certain processions and festivals. He also wears a helmet in the shape of the petasos, a hat typically worn by travelers, the metal version of which appears on Athenian reliefs and is known from archaeology. He carries two hunting spears, and not the kamax, the long thin spear principally used by Greek cavalry.Nicholas Sekunda, The Ancient Greeks (Osprey Publishing, 1986, 2005), p. 19. Around the turn of the 21st century a number of the artist's lekythoi were discovered in a mass burial of plague victims in Athens.Oakley, \\"White Lekythoi from Gela,\\" p. 212. Work from the atelier of the Reed Painter is concentrated in Attica, though a few examples have been found as exports to Gela and Corinth.Maria Cecilia d'Ercole, \\"Figures hybrides d l'identité: Le cas de l'Adriatique préromaine,\\" in Identités ethniques dans le monde grec antique (Presses Universitaires du Mirall, 2007), p. 172. The Reed Painter worked in true white-ground technique, in which polychrome figures are outlined on the white ground, first in a dilute brown glaze and then in a more-fluid matt black or red. Women's skin was painted white on white, with solid colors on garments. The colors — including bright red, yellow, purple, blue, and green — were added after firing.Connor and Jackson, A Catalogue of Greek Vases, p. 157. The unstable pigments have flaked away and often left figures on surviving vases with the appearance of nudity when they were intended to be clothed.Donald White et al., The Ancient Greek World: The Rodney S.

While the environmental organizations were litigating the injunction in the lower courts, the parties reached a settlement regarding the 238 acres in question and the district court accordingly dismissed. The plaintiffs, however, maintained that they still had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the exemption process generally because the process was statistically certain to implicate their rights in the future.

Best Residence and Auto House, also known as Grandview Apartments and The Alamo, is a historic building located in the central part of Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was included as a contributing property in the Hamburg Historic District in 1983, and it was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Louis P. and Clara K. Best Louis P. Best was born in 1848 in present-day Osthofen, Germany, and was educated in Stuttgart and Berlin. He came to the United States in 1869 and worked as a chemist in New York City. He moved to Davenport in 1874 to work for the Davenport Glucose Manufacturing Company. He eventually bought stock in the company to the point that he became one of their chief stockholders and became involved in the management of the company. He also had other business interests in the city including Davenport Machinery & Foundry Company, of which he was president, the Bettendorf Axle Company, Hawkeye Electric Company, and Citizens National Bank. He later founded a glucose factory in Granite City, Illinois, and in 1908 built the Best Building in Rock Island, Illinois for a department store for which he served as one of the directors. In addition to his business interests, he was a member of the local school board. There is also a local legend that Best invented the process that is used to make Argo cornstarch. Best was married twice, first to Louise Heck in London in 1871. They had a son named Rudolph. Louise died around 1896. He married Clara Krause in 1899 and they had a son Louis and a daughter Margaret (Gretchen). Clara was a businesswoman in her own right. Her father was a pioneer settler in Davenport and he established a clothing manufacturing company that produced overalls. Clara was involved in the management of the company and served as its treasurer for several years. She died in 1922 and Louis died four years later. After Louis died, the children had houses of their own in fashionable McClellan Heights and they did not want this house. In 1928 it was sold in a trade of farmland with Thomas Agar. He converted the house into apartments. After several owners, the property was acquired by Donald and Darlene Brus in 1987. They received a preservation award from the Scott County Historical Society for their restoration work. Architecture The Best house was built on the former location of the Henry C. Struck, Jr. house, which was relocated to the lot immediately to the north. It is one of the few examples of Mission Revival architecture in Davenport, and it is also one the first \\"absolutely fireproof\\" houses built in the Quad Cities. The house is constructed of hollow clay tiles covered with stucco. The flooring decks are composed of steel reinforced concrete joists with intermittent rows of hollow tile. The 2½-story structure features a steep hipped roof typical of an American Foursquare, projecting gabled pavilions with Mission Style curved parapets, a small front porch, and a single-story wing along south elevation. There is also a Paldian window in a Spanish- inspired roof dormer on the west elevation of the house. American Craftsman decorative details are found on the stylized cap detail of the front porch. Prairie School influences are found in the horizontality of the various porches, a projecting one-story window feature, and a two-story sunporch. The roof was originally covered with French-style red roof tiles that have been replaced with red asphalt shingles. The residence is connected to the two- story \\"auto house,\\" or garage, by way of a Roman arch that transports the steam heat from the basement of the house to the auto house. It is constructed of the same materials as the house. The main floor had three bays for automobiles, and the second floor had living space for the chauffeur. There is a roof dormer on the south elevation. Both buildings were designed by the prominent Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Clausen. It is believed that Rudolph Clausen was the designer of the house as he was the younger of the two architects and more familiar with the newer techniques of the day, including the \\"fireproof\\" construction methods and the combination of the Mission and Arts & Crafts styles. Concrete Engineering Company of Davenport did the concrete work, and Jake Sievers was the contractor.

Fusion Fighters The Fusion Fighters, called in the Japanese version, work to bring peace for the Digital World, by protecting inhabitants. They are led by Mikey Kudo. During the series, he recruits Nene Amano and Christopher Aonuma. In the Dark Generals Arc, they form the Fusion Fighters United Army (クロスハート連合軍 Kurosu Hāto Rengougun?, lit. \\"Xros Heart United Army\\") Only named in the characters section for Digimon Xros Wars: The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms's official website. Mikey Kudo  Mikey Kudo, known in Japan as , is an upbeat middle school boy who helps anyone in need. He excels in all sports and has a charming personality that wins over humans and Digimon alike, though he has a tendency to overexert himself. Receiving his red Fusion Loader from Omnimon, one of the Legendary Digimon, Mikey founded the Fusion Fighters alongside his partner Shoutmon. Aside from his charisma, Mikey has proven himself to be an excellent strategist, able to see through the plans of his enemies and counter them accordingly, making his presence a necessity for the team. Unlike other members, Mikey can hear the melody of Digimon that are in life-threatening danger. During their travels, they meet many friendly Digimon who join their cause. They encounter the rival group Blue Flare. They face the evil minions of the Bagra Army as well as Team Midnight. They allow Midnight's former general Nene, Sparrowmon, Monimon and the Monitamons, to join their group after SkullKnightmon casts her aside once she outlives her usefulness to him. When Bagramon steals all 108 Code Crown fragments, he sends Mikey, Angie, Jeremy and Shoutmon back to Earth. There, Mikey learns that time on Earth is far slower than in the Digital World before he attempts to find a way back to the Digital World to save it. By then, the one who gave him his Fusion Loader is revealed to be Omnimon, who reveals the origin of the DigiCards as well as the history of the Digital World and tells them how he ended up on Earth as a DigiCard and has been searching for someone who could hear him, which turns out to be Mikey, as only he can hear the Digital Melody. After enabling Shoutmon to digivolve into OmniShoutmon, in order to do battle, defeat and ultimately destroy Tactimon, Mikey returns to the Digital World with Shoutmon. Upon returning to the Digital World, Mikey and Shoutmon learn that Bagramon had it reconstructed into a realm composed of the Bagra Fortress and seven kingdoms, each ruled by a Dark General with their very own Darkness Loader. Reunited with the other Fusion Fighters, Mikey and Nene convince Christopher to join forces with them and they set to travel together through the Kingdoms to challenge the Dark Generals and liberate the Digital World from Bagramon. After defeating MegaDarknessBagramon, the Digimon members of the Fusion Fighters United Army return to the Digital World. One year later, Mikey, now in eighth grade, formed a street basketball team \\"Xros Heart\\" with Ewan and Tagiru. When the DigiQuartz appears connecting the Real World, Mikey solves the mystery of the attacks. He is revealed to be one of the six Legendary Heroes of the Digimon Multiverse. =Shoutmon= is a ferocious dragon Digimon with extremely high aggressiveness due to hot-blooded enthusiasm, yet friendly towards his comrades. He enjoys singing and wields a microphone for leisure and to help in combat, his chances of winning depending on the amount of passion he has. When wounded while protecting the Village of Light from the Bagra Army's invasion of the Forest Zone, Shoutmon met Mikey as the two eventually join forces to save his home from the invaders. Becoming Mikey's main Digimon partner, Shoutmon's goal is to become Digimon King in order to better protect others, seeing the Code Crown fragments as a mean to fulfill his selfless desire. He acts as the core component of all the Fusion Fighters' primary DigiFusions and is the only member of the Fusion Fighters able to digivolve by himself naturally as well. He ultimately fused himself with all the Digimon members of both the Fusion Fighters and Blue Flare, the restored Digimon which comprised the DigiCards, ally Digimon met during the course of his journey through the Zones and Lands of the Digital World, former enemies, as well as the remaining Digimon inhabitants of the Digital World to take down DarknessBagramon and save both the Digital World and the Earth. After the battle against MegaDarknessBagramon, Shoutmon works hard to improve the newly reformed Digital World as the new Digimon King, until several Digimon start disappearing into DigiQuartz and he joins forces with Mikey once again looking to find the reason for it.

Akudovic believes that the poem \\"Łožak dla pčały\\" A Bed for a Bee written by Uładzimier Niaklajeŭ in his mature age is the best work he had ever written, and one of the best in the entire Belarusian literature. If not the best one ever.\\"Владимир Некляев стал лауреатом первой премии I Международного фестиваля славянской поэзии :… to discover the creative works by V. Nyaklyayew is the work that requires inspiration, soaring in the thoughts and feelings into the sky. Being inspirable and a hard worker, Niaklajeŭ’s achievements are obvious. In general, to describe what Uładzimier Niaklajeŭ is in creative works and life requires the talent equal to his. Neklyayew should be discovered like America. Colombo is still growing up … – Ryhor Baradulin, People's Writer of Belarus :It is nothing to tell that I was happy to work with Niaklajeŭ. Cooperating with any poet, apart from a co-author, I found a friend. In this case, regardless the age difference of 25 years, we could understand each other very well … – Źmicier Vajciuškievič, a bard.Дмитрий Войтюшкевич Social activity Uładzimier Niaklajeŭ was a member of the Union of Creative and Scientific Youth under the Central Committee of Belarus Komsomol and a member of Belarusian Theatrical Association. In 1998–2001 Niaklajeŭ chairman of the Union of Belarusian Writers (preceded by Vasil Zujonak, succeeded by Volha Ipatava. In May 2010, Niaklajeŭ became the member of the Union Council.Структура According to Niaklajeŭ’s words, after having been appointed to the position of the chairman of the Association of Writers, he had to deal with the president of Belarus Alaksandar Łukašenka who treated Niaklajeŭ as \\"the boss over the writers\\". At the same time an agreement creating Belarus and Russia Union State was signed, which was not approved by the writers of Belarus, protesting against this decision in public. It was the beginning of the conflict between Łukašenka and Niaklajeŭ and as a result, Uładzimier Niaklajeŭ had to leave the country. At the 13th special congress of the Union of Belarusian Writers, Niaklajeŭ suggested that there should be accepted the resolution to support the oppositional candidate, saying that Łukašenka was in power illegally and had no right to be the candidate for presidency. In 2005, V. Niaklajeŭ was elected as the head of Belarusian PEN Center, and on 10 April, he voluntarily left that position. Andrej Chadanvič became the next head of the Center. Since 25 February 2010, he was the initiator of the civil campaign \\"Tell the Truth!\\". Neklyayew thinks that finally in the society there appeared the demand for the true information of the current situation in the country, taking into consideration that the powers are lying, hide the real situation or distort the information.Владимир Некляев: белорусское общество живет в условиях обмана и не замечает егоВладимир Некляев собрался в президенты On 18 May 2010 Niaklajeŭ and two other activists were arrested and kept by the law enforcement agencies of Belarus; about 20 activists of the campaign underwent repressions.

It is one of the world's rarest birds with about 150 individuals remaining. The Noongar name for the western ground parrot is kyloring. The western ground parrot plumage is similar to the eastern ground parrot, but feathers of the abdomen and under tail-coverts are bright yellow with indistinct black barring. The fledgling western ground parrot is grey/brown around the head, wing covets and across the back, while the eastern ground parrot has bright green (adult) plumage in these areas. This plumage difference would provide better camouflage to mobile fledglings in the habitat typical of the southwest arid regions where they reside. In contrast the eastern ground parrot lives in thick vegetation with little open ground. Molecular DNA evidence suggests the western ground parrot split from ground parrots of eastern Australia around 2 million years ago. Taxonomy Described as a separate species by Alfred John North in 1911, on account of its distinctive plumage. North compared Western Australian specimens, at the Australian Museum, collected by George Masters in the 1860s at a location noted as King George Sound. The specific name, flaviventris, is derived from the Latin terms flavus \\"golden-yellow\\" and venter \\"belly\\". The western ground parrot was subsequently considered a subspecies of the eastern ground parrot by Gregory Mathews in 1912. He felt it not distinctive enough to warrant specific rank. Other authorities followed suit, until a 2010 molecular study revealed its genetic distinctness from populations in eastern Australia and Tasmania. The third species in genus is the critically endangered and mysterious night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis). The phylogenetic position of the genus Pezoporus within the parrot family remains unclear. Description Stuffed specimen at Göteborgs Naturhistoriska Museum The western ground parrot plumage is similar to the eastern ground parrot (P. wallicus), but feathers of the abdomen and under tail-coverts are bright yellow with indistinct black barring. The fledgling western ground parrot is a more neutral grey/brown in colour, while the eastern ground parrot has bright green (adult) plumage in these areas. Distribution and habitat Historically, this species was found all along the coast of western southwest Australia from Perth north to Geraldton and along the South Coast east to Israelite Bay. However, it appears to have vanished from the west coast of Western Australia by 1900. Nowadays, the range of this species is limited to two locations along the south coast of Western Australia, east of Albany with the largest population in Cape Arid National Park. Low heathland usually on deep white sand with a large diversity of plants is the most common habitat. Parrots appear to be more abundant in heath which has not been burnt for decades, but have been found in areas six years after a burn. There is usually a fairly high component of sedges. Status This species is one of the rarest bird species in the world. The first photo of the western ground parrot in the wild was taken in 2004. This species has rapidly declined between 1990 and 2009 from about 400 individuals to 110 individuals. Most individuals (~100) are found in the Cape Arid National Park.Friends of the Western Ground Parrot, accessed 18 November 2010Burbidge AH, Blyth J (2008) Threatened and rare birds of Western Australia. Department of Environment and Conservation, Perth The species has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN, but it meets several criteria to be considered critically endangered. The main threats are introduced predators, such as foxesDepartment of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) (2008).

Much of the local vegetation is vulnerable to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback and it is unclear what impact the loss of certain food items may have on the species, but there is believed to be less than 40 parrots left. In November 2015, intense bushfires around Esperance burnt almost all of the western ground parrot's habitat. The impact on the population is unclear. Behaviour vocalising The western ground parrot usually feeds alone or with one other bird. They are rarely seen because they rarely fly or call during daylight, and they are usually hidden among low vegetation. Their plumage offers a good camouflage. If flushed it will fly low over the vegetation, then land again up to 100 or so metres away. Flight when flushed is characterised by a zigzag pattern with short gliding phases and rapid wingbeats. Calling periods are at dusk and early morning before the sun rises; it is a variable high-pitched call audible for some distance and answered by neighbouring members of the species. Diet Seeds of various plants especially sedges. e.g. Mesomaelaena stygia ssp. stygia. Flower buds and the base of flowers e.g. beaufortias, dryandras and grevilleas are also important parts of the diet. A western ground parrot has been observed feeding on the semi-succulent leaves of Daviesia pachyphylla. The diet is varied and utilises the high diversity of their habitat. Breeding Photo of nest published in The Emu. Whitlock, 1913. In November 2018 a western ground parrot nest (not in use) was found in Cape Arid National Park during field work carried out by the Department of Parks and Wildlife. This was the first new discovery of a nest since the discovery made in 1913 by F. Lawson Whitlock, who described the nest as a slight depression among low prickly vegetation (possibly the genus Hakea) on a low ridge. Fledglings have been recorded from September to November. Males feed females on the ground in \\"mate-feeding arenas\\", arriving silently just after dusk. Females elicit food from the male by issuing a short rasping begging call (termed scree). On hot dry days the male has difficulty in moving his crop contents as he does not go to water sources during the day. Instead he derives his liquid from the plant material ingested. Hence when the day is hot and dry the crop contents becomes thick and difficult to regurgitate. In the later periods of nesting the female becomes very insistent and will even chase the male when he stops feeding her. Typically at the end of feeding his mate the male gives a loud call and moves a short distance away, while the female leaves undetected from the area. The male may then roost near this site. The nest can be as much as 400 m (1300 ft) from this area, as indicated by the presence of a nearly fledge chick of a known pair monitored in 2005. The female can lay up to five eggs in a recess within a clump of low vegetation which she lines with vegetation. A vacant nest may have been found in 1989 by Ray Garstone while working in Fitzgerald River National Park. While the long unburnt habitat is necessary for nesting it is often adjacent to younger more recently burnt habitat which can provide a richer and more varied food source. Being among the few ground nesting parrots the young ground parrots leave the nest before fledge and are only capable of short unsteady flight. These young have only been seen on two occasions in the last 90 years. Post fledging the young are assumed to be attended by the male (field indications support this). Seven critically endangered western ground parrots have been transferred by the Department of Parks and Wildlife of Western Australia in July 2014 from a secluded south coast enclosure in Western Australia to the Perth Zoo, where it is hoped they will breed.Parks and Wildlife, Government of Western Australia, Media Statement, Minister’s office - 6552 5800, July 2014 ReferencesExternal links *Friends of the Western Ground Parrot ** http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/action/birds2000/pubs/ground- parrot-w.pdf – Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000 *Information Page From the Australian Government **[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/20-birds- by-2020/western-ground-parrot western ground parrot Category:Endemic birds of Southwest Australia western ground parrot western ground parrot ","title":"Western ground parrot"},{"id":"29652412","text":"The House at 919 Oneida Street is a historic building located on the east side of Davenport, Iowa, United States.

Architecture This house shows the development of the Italianate form in Davenport from the Joseph Mallet House and the Joseph Motie House, both of which were built earlier. This particular house is a good example of the Vernacular-Italianate style that was popular in Davenport after the Civil War. with It features projections from the box-like form, bracketed eaves, curved window hoods, and decorative elements cut by jig and scroll saws. The arched window surrounds, the front porch with the Corinthian order column caps, the bracketed cornice, and the unusual gable with decorative millwork apron and the bargeboards above the central oculus are all original to the house. Some of these elements are also found locally on Second Empire style houses. Its complex plan and roofscape, exemplified here by the full-height projecting window bays and gabled dormers toward the back of the structure, would be a feature of later Victorian architecture in Davenport. Local Lore The house was originally built at the bottom of the hill but was later moved to the top and its current placement per the owner's wishes. Such a move required the house to be literally split in two, then the halves were moved using an 'ice-block' method in which the house was set on giant blocks of ice and pulled by a horse.

Early life Born in 1888, Arthur Sweetser was a member of a generation that saw the nations of the world engaging in violent bloodshed in what was labelled optimistically as the War to End all Wars. This was a period when contemporary principles of international law were first taking form and beginning to be put into practice. Following on the heels of World War I, there were many people who saw the urgency of developing greater cooperation among nations. Arthur Sweetser was one of these. He came from a family that valued travel. His father wrote New England guidebooks. His uncle was a broker for a shipping firm. He traveled the world after graduating from college, then became a reporter, first for the Springfield Reporter and then for the Associated Press.Susan Collingswood Sweetser, One Shining Hour, (New York: International School of Geneva Press, 2005), 23-5. Journalism career In 1914, when war was declared in Europe, Arthur Sweetser worked as a war correspondent, traveling through the thick of the battle zones. His book, \\"Roadside Glimpses of the Great War,\\"Arthur Sweetser, Roadside Glimpses of the Great War, (New York: MacMillan, 1916). was a study of World War I from the vantage point of a reporter in the middle of the action. He was assigned to the State Department by the Associated Press. He walked the halls with such great figures as Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Howard Taft. This was a period when U.S. isolationism was being questioned. The League to Enforce Peace League to Enforce Peace Timeline was one effort to bring the U.S. and other countries into accord. Although this effort was not to succeed, the more successful League of Nations followed soon after. Arthur Sweetser was present at the inception of the League of Nations in Paris in 1920. He was a member of the American Peace Commission appointed by Woodrow Wilson. Sweetser was directly involved in the League's development as a member of its provisional Secretariat in London and subsequently joined the permanent Secretariat in the League's Public Information Section. Role in education His work with the League led to his involvement with the International School of Geneva.International School of Geneva This school was developed to accommodate the children of diplomates as well as others seeking a more diversified education, with a program offering multiple languages and a non- political approach that would enable students to succeed in their home colleges. Sweetser's involvement exemplified his belief that an international education was essential if there was ever to be communication among the world powers. One offspring of the evolution of international schools was the development of the International Baccalaureate (IB). The goal of this program, according to the organization's website is, \\"to help develop the intellectual, personal, emotional and social skills to live, learn and work in a rapidly globalizing world.\\" In addition to the accomplishments mentioned, Arthur Sweetser became the first head of the United Nations Information Office in Washington following the second World War. He was the first President of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, and he wrote a great many books and articles on subjects pertaining to global policy, communication, and education. In addition to his participation as a co-founder of the International School of Geneva in 1924, he assisted in the creation of the United Nations International School in New York, and also founded International Schools Services (ISS). The creation of International Schools Services came about in 1955. Sweetser noted that the insurgence of international and American schools across the globe had brought about a need for support for their educational programs, administration, and facilities. He established this non-profit group to provide these services. The company was available to help schools find high-quality faculty and materials and to provide the support that this growing sector would continue to need for future expansion. Death Arthur Sweetser died in 1968, but he made a strong and resounding impact on international education and global affairs.

As his retail and other businesses prospered, he was elected to the House of Commons in 1916, but after an electoral defeat in 1918 he returned to commerce and prospered in amusements catering. However, excessive spending and a series of business difficulties and led to him being made bankrupt in 1931. Early life Brookes was born in Chorlton, Manchester, the son of Warwick Brookes. His youngest brother Gordon was an actor who served in World War I as a Captain in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. Gordon was killed in action on 16 September 1916. Business Brookes had a variety of business interests. Before World War I he had an iron foundry in Essex, and was also involved in Eugen Sandow's Institute of Physical Culture, an early gymnasium for body builders. Brookes and his father were both directors of the Piccadilly-based company, Sandow (Limited), which was wound up in 1916. At the start of the war he became managing director (MD) of the Junior Army & Navy Stores; later he set up a factory which manufactured equipment for the British Army, such as canvas buckets and groundsheets. He was also MD of the Civil Service Co- operative Society (based in Haymarket) and of Booth & Brookes Ltd and T.T. Nethercoat & Co. Ltd. In the autumn of 1917 he visited the United States to promote the Junior Army & Navy Stores, where he launched an advertising campaign which led to a big increase in custom from American servicemen based in the United Kingdom. His various ventures made him a wealthy man, and by 1918 he was registered as the joint owner of No. 145 Oxford Street, and lived in Park Lane, which was then one of the city's most fashionable streets. When the Civil Service Co-op merged with the Junior Army & Navy in July 1919, Brookes was offered £250,000 for his stake in the former, but declined the offer. He became MD of the Army & Navy, on a salary of £7,500 a year, and a few years later in the slump after the end of the Great War, he sold his stake for £25,000. In the 1920s, he won the concession to establish the amusement park at the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley, and later secured the same rights at the Paris Exhibition. However, the Paris project failed entirely after an accident on the park's scenic railway. He was also involved with promoting British Controlled Oil Fields Limited, but his various joint ventures with James White ran into difficulties after White's death. At this point he was in grave financial difficulties, but began working to develop the British interests of a group of American investors who promised him substantial reward. However those ventures did not proceed as the Great Depression took hold, and the promised payments never materialised. Debts and loss of income combined with an extravagant lifestyle to force him into bankruptcy in October 1931, with liabilities of £50,000. When he sought a discharge from bankruptcy in 1932, only £39 had been realised in assets, with hopes of a further £252. Politics=Newington In June 1908, Brookes was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Newington West constituency, in South London. He campaigned for the Conservative candidate at the by-election in Chelmsford in November that year but at the general election in January 1910 he lost in Newington West to the sitting Liberal Party MP Captain Cecil Norton, by a margin of 412 votes (5.0%) At the December 1910 election, Norton, by now Assistant Postmaster-General, saw off Brookes again, this time with a majority of 540 votes (7.2%). Norton was elevated to the peerage in 1916 as Baron Rathcreedan, triggering a by-election in Newington West. Norton had already indicated his intention to stand down from the Commons at the next general election, and the City of London merchant J. D. Gilbert had already been selected as the Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate. In ordinary circumstances this would have led to a by-election contested both by Gilbert and by Brookes, who had been adopted as the prospective Conservative candidate, but the war had brought a different logic. The parties in the coalition government led by H. H. Asquith had agreed an electoral pact for the duration of the war: when a vacancy arose in a seat held by the Conservatives, the Liberals would not contest the resulting by- election, and vice versa. It soon became clear that some sort of contest was likely. The Unionist Labour Party invited Lambeth Borough Councillor W. A. Perkins to contest the seat on its behalf, and the London Trades Union Protest Committee selected Joe Terrett to stand on a platform of opposition to the recently introduced drink orders introduced on liquor traffic by the Central Control Board. At this point Brookes was still considering whether to stand, so Terrett offered to step down if Brookes would agree to stand and oppose the drink orders. Meanwhile, the Executive of the Liberal Association in Portsmouth made a counter-offer: if Brookes stepped aside, it would agree not to contest the Portsmouth by-election which had been triggered by the ennoblement of the Conservative MP Lord Charles Beresford. Brookes did step aside, in the interests of preserving the truce between the parties. Mile End Brookes waited less than a week for another chance to enter Parliament. On 9 January, two days after the close of nominations in Newington West, a vacancy arose in the East London, in the Mile End division of Tower Hamlets. Mile End's Conservative MP Colonel Harry Lawson succeed to the peerage as Baron Burnham, on the death of his father, and on 12 January Brookes was selected as the Conservative candidate. Noel Pemberton-Billing, who had resigned from the Royal Naval Air Service to campaign for greater use of air power in World War I, stood as an independent candidate, promising that when the defence of London was in the hands of \\"practical airmen\\" the city would be safe from air raids by zeppelins. Canvassing on behalf of Brookes began immediately. J. D. Gilbert, who had won the Newington West by-election, sent him a letter of support asking Mile End's Liberals to support Brookes, and B.S. Straus, who had been the prospective Liberal candidate in Mile End, offered to sign Brookes's nomination papers. Campaigning in support of an intensified war effort, Brookes supported the \\"economic strangulation\\" of Germany, and backed Military Service Bill which would introduce conscription. He also supported the development of air defences, and advocated an air force given the same pre-dominance then held by the Royal Navy. The writ for the by- election was issued on 17 January, and with the campaign well underway The Times newspaper commented the next day that it would be \\"unwise to speculate on the result\\". Many of Mile End's 6,000 electors were unable to vote, since they were away serving in the war. Some 2,000 of the voters were Jewish, and their support was seen as critical; many of them were shopkeepers, and The Times speculated that they might be attracted to Billings' commitment to end the blackout. Billings made his speeches from the cockpit of an aeroplane and both candidates advocated similar policies for strengthening air defences. Nominations closed on 21 January, and the First Lord of the Admiralty, Arthur Balfour, intervened to denounce the \\"criminality\\" of an implication by Billings that the air defence of the East End had been neglected because the people there were poor. Polling took place on 25 January, and Brookes was declared the winner with a majority of 376 votes (10.4%) over Billings. Later that week, as a new Member of Parliament (MP), Brookes joined a delegation of London MPs who visited Lord Kitchener at the War Office to discuss the protection of London from raids by aircraft. Preston At the post-war general election in December 1918 Brookes did not stand again in Mile End, which was held with a huge majority by the Coalition Conservative candidate Walter Preston. Instead he stood as a Coalition Conservative for the borough of Preston, where he won neither of the two seats. The Times observed that the \\"transference of an old London member to Preston did not suit local tastes\\". Yachting For two decades, Brookes was a regular competitor at yachting events in England. His 6 Metre-class yacht The Alien competed regularly in events at the Eastern of England Yacht Club in Burnham-on-Crouch in 1908, 1909 although he does not appear to have won any major races. By 1920 he was sailing Susanne, a 154-Thames Ton schooner built in 1904 to the designs of William Fife, and competing against the King's yacht Britannia at Deal and in Cowes Week. In 1922 Brookes raced in a 15-metre class yacht Tuiga and in 1925 he competed at Cowes Week in a 51-ton cutter Hispania. In 1928 he bought the steam yacht Sea Fay.

Goethe's exact route is however not known today. Starting from Torfhaus, the Goethe Way runs along the Abbegraben stream past the Great Torfhaus Moor (Großer Torfhausmoor) heading southeast, to below the Quitschenberg mountain - and the crags of Luisenklippen before reaching the Kaiser Way (Kaiserweg). After a few hundred metres where it shares the path with the latter route, the Goethe Way branches off to the east. Following a northeastern curve over the Quitschenberg it circles the Brockenfeld Moor, the source of the rivers Abbe and Cold Bode. Shortly after the Eckersprung it crosses the border into Saxony-Anhalt. At the depot station the Goethe Way meets the Brocken Railway. Until the closure of the former border region by East Germany in 1961, the Goethe Way next ran on a straight line to the northeast over the Königsberg, past the Hirschhornklippen crags, and up to the summit of the Brocken. Today, the path runs along the \\"New Goethe Way\\" (Neuer Goetheweg) opened in 1991 running in an arc along the railway line up to the Brocken Road. Here, it crosses the natural tree line and reaches the Brocken plateau shortly after crossing the road.

With an estimated magnitude of 7.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale, and a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, the quake destroyed 1,167 houses and caused 275 deaths and 320 injuries. Tectonic setting The earthquake was located close to the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. This area of thickened crust is a result of the ongoing collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. The way in which this zone accommodates the collision remains unclear with two end-member models being proposed. The first regards the crust as being made up of a mosaic of strong blocks separated by weak fault zones, the microplate model. The second regards the deformation as being continuous within the mid to lower crust, the continuum model. The change in width of the deformed zone along the collisional belt, with the narrow zone of western Tibet compared to the main part of the Tibetan Plateau, is explained as either lateral escape to the east along the Altyn Tagh and Karakorum faults in the microplate model or as the effect of the rigid Tarim Basin block causing heterogeneous deformation within a generally weaker lithosphere in the continuum model. At its northern end, the Altyn Tagh fault progressively loses displacement by its interaction with a series of WNW–ESE trending structures, mostly with components of reverse displacement and sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip. The Changma fault is one of those structures. Damage The region stricken by this earthquake included the entire Changma Basin and the western part of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu province. The greatest damage occurred in Changma. In Gaotai, Jinta, Anxi and Dingxin part of the city walls and some buildings collapsed and many houses were damaged. In the town of Changma all 800 families were affected, 270 people died and at least another 300 were injured; deaths were also recorded in Gaotai (3) and Jinta (2). Characteristics A surface rupture of about 116 km was identified after the earthquake, including five separate fault segments, the largest rupture observed for a reverse-slip event in Asia in the twentieth century. Four of the segments that ruptured were reverse faults, the fifth was a strike-slip fault. Vertical offsets of more than a metre were observed on most of the segments, with a maximum of 5 m. Seismic hazard implications  The 1932 Changma earthquake shows that apparently separate mapped intracontinental reverse faults may rupture simultaneously in an earthquake. Estimates of the seismic hazard in an area based on the rupture of single reverse faults may lead to a major underestimate of the magnitudes of the largest possible earthquake.

Jacob and Sara sailed to the colony of New Amsterdam about 1650, and stayed there till 1662, when they returned to Holland. During his residence in the Dutch settlement, he owned farms at Amersfort and Mespath, a house and lot on what is now Pearl Street, and another on Broadway. He lost his fortune when the English took over Manhattan. He left New Netherland, joined the Dutch East India Company and in 1665/66 the couple took off to Batavia. Here they managed an orphanage and Steendam published poetry until 1671. In the late 19th century, Henry Cruse Murphy, when he was United States minister to The Hague, discovered some poems written by Steendam on New Amsterdam, and had them printed with an English version in the same metre. Murphy's book is entitled Jacob Steendam noch vaster. A Memoir of the First Poet in New Netherlands, with his Poems descriptive of the Colony (The Hague, 1861). The titles of the two poems are Klacht van Nieuw-Amsterdam (published in Amsterdam in 1659; translated with subtitle as : \\"Complaint of New Amsterdam, in New Netherlands, to her Mother, of her Beginning, Growth, and Present Condition\\") and 't Lof van Nuw-Nederland (1661; \\"The Praise of New Netherlands: Spurring Verses to the Lovers of the Colony and Brothership to be established on the South River of New Netherland by Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy van Ziereckzee\\" (published in 1661).

Production publicity website for City College of San Francisco Theatre Department and the Diego Rivera Theatre Language of Angels begins in a cave on the edge of a rural North Carolina town, where a young girl once went missing. One of nine friends is responsible for her death, yet her ghostly, echoed cries will haunt each of them forever. Iizuka weaves together the parallel paths each friend takes that lead to their own tragic fates. Her ghost story morphs into a multi-layered musing on grief, loss, guilt and karma, and the elusive truth behind missing girl's life and death reveals itself one piece at a time. \\"Because Iizuka set the structure of Japanese Noh drama, with its ghostly presences and shifting time, against the rural landscape of North Carolina, we likewise juxtapose elements of Japanese drama with clearly drawn characters from a mountain village in the South,\\". \\"What surfaces is a beautifully poetic Appalachian voice – a familiar voice of hardship, despair and grief elegantly spun into a centuries-old dramatic structure.\\" Hidden beneath the scary, mysterious exterior, Language of Angels is ultimately a touching and deeply heartfelt play. As the surviving friends come to terms with their own mortality, they must also face the truth about their childhood and the regret and guilt their mistakes have caused them.  Characters  * Celie * Seth * JB * Billy * Allison * Danielle * Kendra * Michael * Voices (of Mother and Daughter)  Plot = Part I  Language of Angels opens with an interview style description of that night from Kendra, Seth and JB. They are not aware of the others on stage and tell their bit straight to the audience. They describe a night when all 10 of the characters went into the caves and got drunk. When they awoke the next morning Celie was gone. We see graffiti from that night illuminated on the wall (JB loves Joline - Tommy loves Danielle - Sean loves Kendra - Billy loves Allison - Seth loves Celie. 4ever and ever.) We get conflicting descriptions of Celie's character- JB calls her wild and dangerous while Seth (her boyfriend at the time) thinks of her as angelic and gentle. As they tell their stories, Celie, as a ghost appears, acting out the storyteller's scenario. Seth goes on to say how almost everyone who was in the cave last night has died young. He and Kendra also talk about how people believe her spirit still walks the hills and the caves- they believe they hear her singing. Seth and Kendra both admit to feeling haunted by Celie's spirit, while JB seems to have left that night deep in the recesses of his mind. Celie appears, as a ghost, and tells that JB was her murderer. She tells how far in the future JB will die and his daughter will find him. She says his daughter will discover his back is covered in burning messages, the most clear of the messages reading, \\"Remember me 4ever and ever\\". Celie says his daughter would never tell a soul. With that, Celie reaches out and JB feels a burning in his back across the stage.  Part II  Part II opens on Allison and Danielle, two friends of Celie's who were in the cave that night. They are both strippers, and in the previous scene, Seth indicated that they are on drugs. In this scene, they are meeting a stranger named Michael. Danielle is not interested in Michael until she realizes that he resembles her late fiancé Tommy (who was in the cave that night.) Suddenly there is a time warp and Michael is Tommy, caressing her face telling her that death is not so bad. There is a moment of love between them, when suddenly we return to present time and Michael is coming on to Danielle, which she rejects completely. Allison continues to talk to Michael, and describes how she, Danielle and Celie were all very close, how they used to sing in harmony together. Danielle tries to hush Allison but she seems lost in memory, unaware, and continues to reminisce. Danielle sings suddenly, Michael is Tommy again, and Tommy lovingly tells Danielle not to be so sad. Billy enters, a rude drunk now, and Danielle introduces him to Michael. Allison says what everyone is thinking: that Michael resembles Tommy. Immediately, Billy and Danielle start to argue about Tommy. Billy and Tommy were best friends while Danielle and Tommy were engaged; they argue about who knew him better and Billy begins to tell about the night Tommy died. They start to yell at each other. Then Billy takes out his gun and fires at Michael, which immediately sends us into a time warp to the night of Tommy's death. The man who was playing Michael in the last scene is now playing a very high Tommy, Danielle and Billy are drunk and Tommy keeps laughing with Billy, then becoming suddenly intimate with Danielle. Danielle and Billy keep stepping out of the scene to argue about how things went that last night because neither of them can remember. Finally their argument climaxes when Billy confesses to how he dared Tommy to jump off the cliff and Billy breaks down emotionally. Danielle also quiets and addresses Tommy's ghost, she tells him she can't remember if she told him how much she loved him that night. Tommy hushes her and holds her and tells her she must start living life and that she can't be so caught up in that night. Then Tommy speaks to Danielle in the language of angels and relieves her of her guilt. Billy then tries to reach out to Tommy but time is shifting back into present time; the parking lot with Michael. Billy is confused and angry and shoots Michael. Allison tells how Billy took off the night he shot Michael, but was soon apprehended by the police. He confessed that he shot Michael, didn't even know who he was. She says that she asked him why, but he never could tell. She says she hasn't seen him since he went to prison. Sh says that she was in love with him and that what happened broke her heart. Allison disappears leaving Danielle alone, singing.  Between  There is a short scene titled ‘Between’ before Part III. In this bit, Seth retells what happened to all of the people in the cave. Then a mother and daughter- the voices- speak; the daughter questions her mother about angels and how they might be able to fly.  Part III  Part III is set in Danielle's house, and JB is there. The pair engage in a lot of awkward small talk. Danielle seems more alive and at peace, while JB seems more tense. When Danielle directly asks him why he came to see her, he dodges the question, and starts talking about the weather and drinking. Danielle says she's quit drinking and JB suddenly arches his back in pain. Danielle asks him again if he had any particular reason for coming to see her, and JB starts to talk about people from to the cave. He is haunted by Joline, his girlfriend at the time who died mysteriously in her sleep the same year Celie was killed. Danielle holds him and he holds her. He starts to run his fingers over the needle scars in her arm. JB starts to talk about Seth and Kendra, asking if Danielle had seen or heard from them recently. Danielle says she has never heard from Kendra, though she states that before Seth went into the cave to find Celie, he came to Danielle. He told her how there is a ladder between heaven and earth and that souls can go up it and come down, and that he had seen it. JB asks Danielle to remember the night with Celie but Danielle has left that night behind her. JB is still very haunted by his past while Danielle seems to have parted with it. JB tells how he found Sean, shot through the chest, supposedly a hunting accident. From JB's stories you can tell that he believes all of the deaths were caused by Celie but isn't willing to admit that to himself. Finally, he leaves Danielle, still haunted by ghosts of the past. Finally, Danielle hears a knocking on the door and calls in Celie's ghost, telling her that she has found another song they can sing together.

Failler, p. 469 Chranisthlavos) (fl. 1278–1304) was a Bulgarian military commander who was a close associate of rebel leader and later Tsar Ivaylo (r. 1277–1280). After being captured by the Byzantines, Hranislav entered the service of Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) as his megas tzaousios. As a Byzantine officer, he commanded a detachment which assisted the Catalan Company in the anti-Turkish wars in Asia Minor. Biography Few details are known about Hranislav prior to his capture by the Byzantines. Byzantine historian George Pachymeres describes him as a \\"warlike man, a Bulgarian by descent\\" and one of Ivaylo's officers and supporters.ПавловАндреев, p. 390Pachymeres, ed. Failler, p. 468 Historian Plamen Pavlov theorizes that Hranislav must have been an early follower of Ivaylo from the very outbreak of his uprising and thus one of his most trusted commanders. He believes Hranislav was granted the Byzantine loan-title of megas primikerios after Ivaylo was installed in the capital Tarnovo. Hranislav was taken captive by the armies of Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), whose campaigns against Bulgaria in 1278–1280 sought to eliminate Ivaylo and put Ivan Asen III (r. 1279–1280) on the Bulgarian throne. Hranislav had to spend at least a few years imprisoned in Constantinople before Michael's son and next Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos released him.Иречек, p. 334 Andronikos desired to make use of Hranislav's military talents and elevated him to the status of megas tzaousios. Bulgarian scholars interpret the role of the megas tzaousios as the head of the imperial guardБългарска енциклопедия А–Я and a chief assistant of the megas primikerios. In fact, the nature of this military office, which derives from Turkish çavuş, \\"messenger\\", is far from clear.Kazhdan, pp. 2135–2136 In his new duty as a Byzantine general, Hranislav was deployed to northwest Asia Minor, where his major task was the defence of that province against the advancing Turks. He was subordinate to the Western mercenary Roger de Flor and his Catalan Company, though he stood in charge of a separate military unit. His forces may have included a Bulgarian participation of unknown number.Андреев, p. 391 Hranislav's detachment took part in the Byzantine–Catalan victory over the Turks at Germe in the spring of 1304. However, the distribution of loot proved to be a major matter of dispute between Roger and Hranislav. The former accused the latter of greediness and in the ensuing conflict hanged twelve of his soldiers. Roger even stabbed Hranislav with his sword and was about to hang him, had it not been for the intervention of other Byzantine generals, who saved the Bulgarian due to his \\"many praiseworthy acts\\". Nothing is known of Hranislav's destiny after 1304, although he is not mentioned to have died from his wounds. Legacy Hranislav is briefly referenced in national writer Ivan Vazov's 1907 novel Svetoslav Terter. In one of the chapters, the book tells the story of Hranislav's fictional nephew Radoil, a brigand and adventurer who fought the Tatars of Nogai Khan and the Seljuks. In Vazov's novel, Hranislav is described as a famous hero from Ivaylo's time.

Early and family life Ephraim Cutler was born in Edgartown, Massachusetts on April 13, 1767. The oldest son of Manasseh Cutler, he was named for his father's brother, who had been thrown from a horse and died the previous year. From age three, he lived with his grandparents in Killingly, Connecticut, and only once was taken to visit his father and siblings, though they sometimes visited.David McCullough, The Pioneers, Simon & Schuster 2019 p. 122 Ephraim Cutler loved to read, but did not attend Yale College, as had his father, because the American Revolutionary War made such \\"impracticable,\\" although he later often regretted his lack of formal education and would frequently misspell words in his letters. Instead, Ephraim took over his grandfather's farm when he was 16, and also ran a shop by the 1790s.McCullough p. 122 When he was 20, Ephraim married Leah Atwood (of Killingly), on April 8, 1787. In that year his father Manasseh Cutler had helped convince the Congress of the Confederation to pass the Northwest Ordinance, which established a political framework for settlement beyond the Appalachian Mountains. Manassah Cutler was a leader of the Ohio Company of Associates, a land company which bought a large tract in what is now southeast Ohio. Ephraim Cutler became a sales agent for the company, and sold twenty subscriptions. These shareholders elected him to represent them at a meeting of the company in 1788, even though he was not yet of legal age. Meanwhile, his younger brother Jervis Cutler had left for Marietta, Ohio in 1787, but by 1794 returned to New England to marry.McCullough p. 123 Ephraim's first wife, Leah, suffered from delicate health for years after giving birth to several children, and losing two en route to Ohio before giving birth to the two children who survived her. She died of tuberculosis on November 3, 1807, but insisted that Cutler remarry. Though they had never met, she specifically suggested Ephraim marry Sally Parker of Newburyport, Massachusetts (the daughter of Ohio Company stockholder William Parker), who would be a mother to their surviving children. Cutler followed the advice, writing to and eventually marrying Sally, who bore several children.McCullough pp. 178=180 Northwest After hearing about General Anthony Wayne's victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794, and hoping that southern Ohio's climate could restore his wife's health, Ephraim Cutler decided to move his family from Killingly. Thus, he sold the farm, and on June 15, 1795 set out with his wife, four children (aged 7 through 1 year old) and several members of the family of Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam for Ohio. They traveled by foot (the Cutlers accompanied by a two horses, a cow and cart drawn by oxen) to the Monongahela River near Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where they had a Kentucky flat-boat built. The river was low, so progress was slow. The boat finally landed at Marietta on September 18, 1795, after 31 days on the river. However, their eldest and youngest children (Mary and Hezekiah) fell ill and died along the way. Leah Cutler also fell and broke two ribs, and her husband contracted dysentery, but recovered in a rented room in the blockhouse of Campus Martius. With Ephraim Cutler's recovery in October, the family moved up the Muskingum River to Waterford, Ohio, where some Killingly families had settled and offered shelter, as well as hired Ephraim to help them plow. Cutler also settled company business in Marietta that autumn and Rufus Putnam paid him $100 to survey land in the Donation Tract. In 1796 he bought some land nearby, and later helped develop and market a salt spring. Cutler also received commissions from Governor Arthur St. Clair, becoming captain of the militia, Justice of the Peace and Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. By 1799 he became the first settler in what would become Ames Township, Athens County, Ohio, moving his wife, two surviving children from Connecticut, and two children born in the Northwest. In 1800, the Legislature of the Northwest Territory named Cutler to examine and lease the School Lands sections in his part of the territory, which involved a great deal of travel. He convinced the people of Ames Township to establish the Western Library Association in 1804, one of the earliest libraries formed in the Northwest Territory. Money was raised for the library through sale furs and other items. It came to be called the \\"Coonskin Library.\\" It was not the first incorporated in the state, as three others in the state had been incorporated before it was incorporated in February, 1810. Cutler was elected the first librarian. Territory politics In September, 1801, Cutler was elected to represent Washington County, Ohio in the House of Representatives of the Northwest Territory at the First Session of the Second Territorial General Assembly convened November 23, 1801 – January 23, 1802, where he drafted the legislation that incorporated the predecessor to Ohio University. After adjournment, he visited his father in Washington, D.C., where he sat as a member of Congress from Massachusetts, and where Ephraim witnessed the passing of the Ohio Enabling Act. \\\\- Text of Act of April 30, 1802 (section 7) Library of Congress This act allowed for four delegates to be elected from Washington County, which then included Cutler's home. Cutler was nominated by his party at a county convention to be one of those four, who were each elected as delegates in September, and Cutler sat as a delegate to the Ohio Constitutional Convention November 1–29, 1802, which wrote the Constitution accepted by Congress, and led to statehood in 1803. The first vote at the convention after procedural issues had been settled was on the approval of \\"Resolved, That it is of the opinion of the convention, that it is expedient, at this time, to form a constitution and State government.\\" It was resolved Yeas, 32, nays, 1, with Ephraim Cutler the only Federalist to vote nay. Nevertheless, he participated vigorously, and managed to affect the outcome on several issues. Cutler also tried, without success, to have the Constitution submitted to a referendum by the population, saying \\"I deem it of primary importance that the people of this territory should have some opportunity of declaring their assent to or dissent from this instrument before it became binding on them...By adopting the resolution to submit the constitution to a vote of the people the mouths of the clamorous would be stopped, and the minds of the judicious satisfied.\\" The delegates voted 27-7 against, preferring haste. Statehood Cutler was township Justice of the Peace 1803-1805 and township trustee of Ames Township in 1806, but Cutler's wife fell ill, and the family moved to Belpre, or Constitution, Warren Township, a ghost town outside of Belpre, to be near a doctor. She died November 3, 1807, and Cutler sent his nine-year-old son Daniel to Massachusetts to live with his Grandparents. On April 13, 1808, he married Sally Parker, a native of Newburyport, Massachusetts, with whom he had five more children, four of whom survived to adulthood, including William P. Cutler, who would serve as speaker of the Ohio House, and as a member of Congress. Early in statehood, Federalists fell out of favor. Consequently, Cutler had to wait until passions cooled to be elected to represent Washington County in the Ohio House of Representatives in the Eighteenth General Assembly (1819–1820) and in the Ohio Senate in the Twenty- second and Twenty-third General Assembly (1823–1825) The two topics where he had greatest effect in the legislature was establishment of a common school system to replace the strictly local efforts up to that time, and for reform of land taxes from a direct system to an ad valorem system. Under the direct system, land was levied by acre, without reference to value. Thus small, but wealthy Hamilton County paid less land tax to the state than large, but mostly rural Washington County. This was politically tolerable until taxes would have to rise significantly to pay for canals between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. At that point, Cutler's arguments finally won out, and taxes began to be assessed on value, rather than acreage. Cutler also lobbied vigorously for the interests of Ohio University, where he was a Trustee from 1820 to 1849. In later years, Cutler was a delegate to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1835 in Pittsburgh, and 1837 in Philadelphia, and in 1839 he was a delegate representing the Sixth Congressional District of Ohio at the National Convention of the Whig Party in 1839. In 1841, he was first President of the Marietta Historical Association, and he assisted Dr. Hildreth in his history. He also helped to organize and participated in the Underground Railroad. Sally Cutler died June 30, 1846. In spring of 1853, Ephraim fell from a horse, and, after four months of invalidism, he succumbed on July 8, 1853. The obituary in the Marietta Intelligencer read \\"In every sphere and relation of life, Judge Cutler was a useful man. He was an upright judge, an intelligent legislator, a good neighbor, a public-spirited citizen, an affectionate father, a sincere Christian, and an honest, true man.\\" See also *Manasseh Cutler *William P.

Brunswijk served in the early 1980s as the personal body guard of Dési Bouterse, who overthrew the government in 1980 in a military coup. Brunswijk was discharged after asking for a raise, and denied back pay. In 1985, Brunswijk formed the Surinamese Liberation Army, better known as the Jungle Commando. Brunswijk was seeking to gain recognition and rights for the Maroon minority of the interior, descendants of runaway African slaves who had established independent communities in the 17th and 18th centuries. In addition, he wanted \\"to free Suriname from the military dictatorship.\\" His forces fought against the national military under Bouterse in a civil war called the Surinamese Interior War. The civil war continued from 1986 to 1992, resulting in hundreds of deaths and more than 10,000 refugees in French Guiana, and disruption of important bauxite mining industries. A peace treaty was signed in 1992. Brunswijk has remained active in politics, serving as chair of the General Liberation and Development Party (Algemene Bevrijdings- en Ontwikkelingspartij, ABOP), and as a representative in the National Assembly. In addition he is a player/owner of Marowijne football club Inter Moengotapoe. On 29 June 2020, Brunswijk became Chairperson of the National Assembly of Suriname. On 13 July, Brunswijk was elected vice-president by acclamation in an uncontested election. He was inaugurated on 16 July. Biography Ronnie Brunswijk joined the Suriname National Army at the age of 18. He was considered a good soldier, and was sent to Cuba for commando training. After finishing his training, he was appointed as a personal bodyguard of Desi Bouterse. During a state visit to Nickerie a gunshot was fired. Brunswijk immediately rushed forward to protect the President. Later it was discovered that a soldier in the honorary guard had fired his weapon by accident. In 1984, Brunswijk asked for a raise, but was discharged instead on 16 April, and refused back pay by Major Paul Bhagwandas. The Surinamese Interior War started in Stolkertsijver on 22 July 1986 at around 03:00. 12 soldiers guarding the checkpoint were captured by the Jungle Commando headed by Brunswijk. In 1986, Brunswijk was sentenced in absentia for a bank robbery in Moengo on 26 April. Said bank robbery, a non-violent offence, earned Ronnie Brunswijk the title \\"Robin Hood of Suriname\\" due to his liberation of stolen funds from government held institutions that were returned to the people. During the war, the Jungle Commando received arms and funding from the Netherlands, and Dutch Colonel Bas van Tussenbroek was moved to French Guiana to transfer funds, and serve as military advisor. Moiwana massacre On 29 November 1986, the Surinamese army took revenge by attacking Brunswijk's birth village of Moiwana, where they murdered at least 39 villagers, mostly women and children. They burned down Brunswijk's house and destroyed the village.NRC Handelsblad - Brunswijk wijst graf aan van moorden bij Moiwana More than 100 refugees fled across the border to French Guiana, which became a destination for other refugees as the war wore on. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered the government to pay millions of dollars (US) in compensation to the 130 survivors of the village attack. Post-war activities The government and Brunswijk negotiated a ceasefire on 21 July 1989 in Kourou that included conversion of the Jungle Commando to a regular part of the Surinamese Army, with responsibility for patrolling their traditional interior territory. The government also promised jobs for Maroons in gold prospecting and forestry, as they were isolated from many developing industries. On 8 August 1992, a final peace treaty was signed. The Netherlands prosecuted both Brunswijk and Bouterse in absentia for drug trafficking, and both men were convicted. Brunswijk was convicted in absentia in the Netherlands to eight years imprisonment for cocaine smuggling by a Dutch court in Haarlem despite numerous witnesses contesting the claims. Brunswijk appealed the ruling pursuant to insufficient evidence.DePers.nl - [https://www.digibron.nl/viewer/collectie/Digibron/id/8c452719a51275418ec56c3dbf957484 \\"Acht jaar cel voor Ronnie Brunswijk \\"] In 2000, he was convicted to six years on appeal. There is as of July 2020, an Interpol arrest warrant against him. Brunswijk is chairman of the Surinamese political party General Liberation and Development Party (Algemene Bevrijdings- en Ontwikkelingspartij, ABOP). Brunswijk is also a player and owner of Marowijne football club Inter Moengotapoe. In 2002, Brunswijk built a football stadium in Moengo, which he named the Ronnie Brunswijkstadion. The disciplinary committee of the Surinamese Football Association suspended him for five years because he threatened some players with a handgun during a match in 2005. The suspension was retracted due to lack of evidence. In June 2012, Brunswijk was suspended for 1 year because he behaved violently towards the referee and a player in football match. In December 2007, Brunswijk and Paul Somohardjo beat up Rashied Doekhi, a member of Desi Bouterse's party, in the Surinamese parliament after Doekhi assaulted Brunswijk and Somohardjo, then chair of the Surinamese parliament. The event was broadcast on live television.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F90iT8sakF8 Brunswijk was owner of Robruns NV, a gold mining company. According to a ', Brunswijk owned six gold concessions in 2012. In July 2020, Brunswijk transferred ownership of the gold concessions to a foundation in order to qualify for the Vice Presidency. 2020 Elections Brunswijk was elected to the National Assembly in the 2020 elections. He was elected as Chairman of the National Assembly of Suriname on 29 June 2020 in an uncontested election. Dew Sharman was elected as Vice Chairman. Brunswijk subsequently ran for vice president, and on 8 July, Brunswijk announced that he will be succeeded by Marinus Bee as Chairman of the National Assembly who was installed on 14 July. Brunswijk was the shortest serving Chairman in the history of Suriname. On 1 July 2020, Brunswijk tested COVID-19 positive. He had been tested, because Paul Somohardjo with whom he had lengthy meetings about the new government tested positive. He was released from hospital on 6 July. To show his appreciation for the hospital staff, he donated three cars to nurses who did not have transportation. On 7 July, the coalition nominated Chan Santokhi as President of Suriname and Ronnie Brunswijk as Vice-President. No other candidates have been nominated as per 8 July 2020, 15:00 (UTC−3), and therefore Brunswijk was elected as vice president on 13 July by acclamation in an uncontested election. Brunswijk was inaugurated as vice president on 16 July on the Onafhankelijkheidsplein in Paramaribo in ceremony without public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Family Brunswijk's nephew, Clyde Brunswijk, is a professional kickboxer. Steven Brunswijk, a Dutch comedian and television personality is another nephew.

Although the general attitude towards the poem was not favorable, in July 1855 Whitman received the famous letter from Ralph Waldo Emerson in appreciation of his words of strength, freedom, and power, as well as, “meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy Nature.” As the first phase of Leaves of Grass was published in 1855 most of the press was unaware of the piece, but if there was an opinion about the poem it was mostly negative. According to the Boston Intelligencer, Leaves of Grass was a “heterogeneous mass of bombast, egotism, vulgarity, and nonsense”.  Poem  One’s-Self I sing, a simple, separate person; Yet utter the word Democratic, the word en-Masse. Of physiology from top to toe, I sing; Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the Muse I say the Form complete is worthier far; The Female equally with the Male I sing. Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power, Cheerful for freest action form’d, under the laws divine, The Modern Man I sing. Text of \\"One's Self I Sing\\" from 1884 edition of Leaves of Grass, Wilson & McCormick, Glasgow, 1884.  Meaning  Whitman celebrated the average American and altogether union and equality which differentiates it between stories of the time and of the past. Whitman speaks of individuality in the first lines. The combination of the “one” and the continuing of the “self” throughout the poem can be translated as, “everyman's self”. Whitman also speaks of freedom, identity, and all around brotherhood. The theme changes in the three lines that follow when he references our spirit and physical body, our sexuality, male and female, and our wisdom. The final lines conclude with the idea of desire, physical and inner strength, and potential. Throughout the entire poem there is disagreement, such as, when the speaker says “simple” in the first line, “simple” meaning “not special,” and finishes the first line with “separate,” followed by the third line of \\"en-Masse\\", or togetherness. As the title is, “One’s Self,” not “Myself”, this already forms the bond between the reader and writer which again is what he is conveying in the poem. The final line has the reader caught up in the difference between past heroes and the “modern man” which is just as powerful if one believes that it is so.  Form  The first line is set in regular iambic pentameter, but the flow of the syllables in line two can be called “accentual or anapestic”. Critics noted Whitman’s form of triangular-shaped stanzas beginning with a short line followed by longer lines. Some have understood that by starting the poem off with a short line, it the reader expect “regular” poetry which is relatable and understandable than Whitman's more experimental form. Whitman’s third and final phase of Leaves of Grass was also known as the “inscriptions” section.  Biographical background  Whitman’s writing could clarify an inner fight over his sexuality. Whitman wrote many pieces using the idea that he was the sophisticated teacher and the reader his accepting and willing student in which passion and desire transpire.

He had previously served as national chairman for Pence's vice-presidential campaign in 2016, and as the former executive director of the Republican Governors Association from 2007 to 2010. In 2010, Ayers was named as one of Times 40 most influential people in politics under the age of 40. He also was principal of the lobbying firm C5 Creative Consulting,Miller, Rich, Capitol Fax Blog July 29, 2014, \\"Was Rauner consultant behind anti-Schock ads?\\". and is one of four leading figures in America First Policies, a pro-Trump nonprofit organization founded in January 2017. From November 2016 to January 2017, Ayers was a senior adviser to President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. In December 2018, multiple news organizations described him as a leading contender to succeed John F. Kelly as White House Chief of Staff, but he decided not to take the job. In addition, Ayers also stated that he would leave the Trump Administration by the end of the year. Early life and education Ayers grew up in southern Cobb County, Georgia. In an interview with The New Republic in 2009, Ayers said his parents instilled in him a respect for public service from an early age; he recalled that in 1992, his parents voted for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Ayers described himself as being rather taken with President Clinton and then-Governor Zell Miller, a Democrat, in the 1990s. Ayers graduated from South Cobb High School in 2000. He then went on to study at Kennesaw State University, where he eventually earned his B.A. in political science in 2009. Ayers also studied international and government affairs at the University of Surrey in Guildford, United Kingdom as a part of a study abroad program. Career in politics=College activism in Georgia and first campaign, 2001–2003 While studying as an undergraduate, Ayers joined the College Republicans, becoming president of the school's chapter. During this time, he met Sonny Perdue, who at the time was planning to run for Governor. Ayers was recruited by fellow College Republican Paul Bennecke to join Perdue's campaign and serve as Perdue's \\"body man,\\" taking time off from Kennesaw State University to drive and provide advance for the then-State Senator. He had initially gone to college with the goal of becoming a banker, but his role with Perdue – part assistant, part adviser, part protégé – convinced him to launch a career in politics. \\"I had no interest in joining the campaign. I had my career planned out. I truly did not believe Governor Roy Barnes could be beat at the time\\", Ayers said. \\"After 10 minutes of talking to Sonny, I was one hundred percent confident he was the right person to run this state.\\" In 2002, Perdue was successful in unseating Democratic incumbent Roy Barnes, making him the first Republican governor of Georgia since Reconstruction. \\"When we won, I had the option of basically being the senior adviser to a governor or a freshman in college\\", Ayers said later. \\"I chose the gubernatorial post.\\" Studying nights and weekends, he worked on his college diploma over the next seven years, finally earning his Bachelor's in 2009. Perdue re-election campaign, 2004–2006 In 2004 at age 22, Ayers was named manager of Perdue's re-election committee. He was cited as one of the Republican Party's five \\"fastest rising stars in the nation\\" by the Atlanta Journal Constitution along with then-Louisiana Congressman Bobby Jindal. Two years later, Perdue was re-elected by a 20-point margin (in an otherwise Democratic year), with Ayers having served as manager for the entire campaign. On October 25, 2006—days before the election—Ayers was stopped by the Georgia State Patrol for failure to maintain his lane, driving 50 mph in a 35-mph zone, and suspicion of drunk driving. Ayers himself admitted to consuming \\"a strong Jack (Daniels) and Coke\\", subsequently failed the field-sobriety test, and repeatedly refused to take a breathalyzer. He was cited for DUI; the charges were later reduced to reckless driving. Republican Governors Association, 2007–2010 Perdue was elected to a one-year stint as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and he named Ayers as Executive Director and his longtime associate, Paul Bennecke, as Political Director (later given the additional title of Deputy Executive Director). The two young Georgians conceived an unprecedented four-year plan to professionalize the committee's operation and implement a long-range strategy, leading up to the 2010 midterm elections, when 37 Governors would be elected. Their plan was accepted by the Governors, and Ayers and Bennecke served through four gubernatorial cycles encompassing all 50 states. At the beginning, Republicans were reeling from a terrible 2006 cycle, and held only 22 statehouses. When they left in early 2011, the GOP held 29 Governorships, a net gain of seven (including Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Virginia). When Ayers began his tenure, the RGA was a relatively spartan operation with a budget of $20 million, and a low national profile. By the time his tenure was over, the Governors had increased their operating budget to $135 million and the distinction of being the largest political action committee in 2010. This success led to Ayers quickly being labeled as a rising star and a political wunderkind. RNC and Priebus, 2010–2011 In November 2010, in the flush of RGA's victories, Ayers was widely touted as a potential replacement for Michael Steele as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. However, he declined to seek the position, and instead assisted Reince Priebus of Wisconsin, the RNC's Treasurer, in his campaign. Ayers's work was interpreted as a de facto endorsement of Priebus (and rejection of Steele) by the GOP governors, several of whom reportedly instructed their RNC members to support the insurgent. Following Priebus's election, Ayers agreed to serve with Ed Gillespie as the two leaders of the transition team for the RNC. The Washington Times reported in 2012 that the two \\"quickly made drastic cuts to the staff and overhead and undertook a thoughtful strategic analysis to forge a path forward. Together, they convinced top staffers to come to the RNC.\\" State and national consulting, 2011–2016 After leaving the governors association, Ayers in March 2011 joined Target Enterprises, an ad-buying firm. In June 2011, Ayers took a five-month hiatus to serve as the campaign manager for the presidential bid of Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Ayers was reportedly courted by four other campaigns, and Pawlenty called him \\"without question one of the best political talents in America.\\" However, after a major effort, Pawlenty failed to show well in early debates, lost the Iowa Straw Poll in September 2011, and quickly withdrew from the race, with a half-million-dollar debt. Ayers shouldered the blame: \\"I believe a campaign manager before, during, and after a campaign should accept responsibility and keep their mouth closed. So while there are always two sides to a story, mine won't be one of them.\\"Daily Caller, September 13, 2011, quoted in The Hotline, September 14, 2011, \\"Clearing the Ayers\\". After Pawlenty, Ayers resumed his duties as partner at Target. He started the political firm C5 Creative Consulting.https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics- government/article210494864.html And, in 2015, he created the firm Advance Media Capital, The firm bought air-time on TV stations in swing states months prior to the 2016 election, and then sough to sell this airtime to PACs close to election day. It was dissolved in 2017. He returned to gubernatorial politics in 2013, when he recruited, and served as general consultant for, Bruce Rauner and his campaign in Illinois. The millionaire businessman was eventually elected, winning a contested primary with 40.1% and defeating incumbent Pat Quinn with 50.3% in November 2014. Rauner was the first Republican to win the Illinois governorship in 12 years, and the first political outsider in modern memory. Ayers also led independent SuperPAC, Arkansas Horizon, efforts to help elect Tom Cotton of ArkansasChoma, Russ, OpenSecrets Blog, February 26, 2015, \\"Another Link in Ohio Dark Money\\". and David Perdue of GeorgiaMalloy, Daniel, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, July 30, 2014, \\"BLOG: Political Insider: On Super PACs, 'firewalls', Nick Ayers and David Perdue\\". to the U.S. Senate in November 2014. In late 2014, Ayers sold his interest in Target Enterprises and focused his efforts on political management (through C5 Creative Consulting) and investments (through Ayers Family Holdings). The Wall Street Journal and Wisconsin Watchdog revealed in October 2015 that the \\"John Doe\\" probe of pro-Scott Walker groups and individuals from 2011–12, later deemed an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, had targeted Ayers's emails. In 2016, he was involved as a strategist in several races, including that of Governor Mike Pence for re-election in Indiana and Eric Greitens for Governor of Missouri. When Pence abandoned his re-election campaign upon being designated as Vice-Presidential nominee, Ayers served as a leading strategist for his replacement, Eric Holcomb. Ayers was also linked in May 2016 reports of billionaire Sheldon Adelson's plans to form a pro-Donald Trump SuperPAC for the fall presidential campaign. Pence-for- VP Chairman, 2016 Ayers was the first Pence operative to whom Trump's team reached out, to begin the Vice-Presidential vetting process, and handled negotiations between the Indiana Governor and Trump. Within two weeks, Pence was named to the national ticket, and Ayers was named to chair the Pence effort, serving as a volunteer. (Trump campaign releases and some news stories used the title \\"Senior Adviser\\",Campaign press release, thru Targeted News Service, July 16, 2016, \\"Trump Campaign Announces Expansion of Political Team\\". but Ayers had the primary role in Pence's campaign.) Ayers, Marc Short, and Josh Pitock formed the core team that prepared Pence for the July convention speech and the October Vice Presidential debate.Erin Burnett Outfront, CNN, October 4, 2016, \\"New Details on Mike Pence's Debate Strategy\\"; also in Freak Out Nation (blog), September 17, 2016, \\"Scott Walker playing Tim Kaine in debate prep\\". Transition and post-election activities After the election, Ayers was named as a senior adviser to the Presidential Transition, part of the group replacing the earlier team headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Again, as after the 2010 election, Ayers's name was prominently mentioned as a candidate for chairman of the Republican National Committee. Ayers made the final cut, with strong backing from Pence and presidential adviser Steve Bannon, but ended runner-up to Michigan's Ronna Romney McDaniel. In January 2017, Ayers and three other Trump-Pence aides were named as principals of America First Policies, a new nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the Administration's policies. Ayers was seen as playing an influential role in advising Trump to name two Georgians—Sonny Perdue and Congressman Tom Price—to the Cabinet. \\"Georgia walks away with two of the most consequential Cabinet secretaries who happen to be the two most qualified for the job,\\" said Ayers. \\"It's a testament to the president's extraordinary decision making and his appreciation to Georgia.\\" In March 2017, BuzzFeed reported that Ayers was a major investor in Independent Journal Review, a news website geared to young conservatives, with phenomenal growth in recent years. Ayers does not exercise any editorial control over the site's content, it was reported. Ayers Family Holdings also provides seed capital to Georgia-based startups in the healthcare and technology industry, and reportedly has invested millions nationally in technology, financial services, and healthcare products. Holmsted, LLC, another private Ayers firm, was founded in 2014 and invested millions in Georgia forestry and pecans. Chief of Staff to the Vice President, 2017–2019 On June 29, 2017, it was announced that Ayers would begin serving as Vice President Mike Pence's Chief of Staff. and he assumed office on July 28, 2017, replacing Josh Pitcock. Ayers announced he would depart the Trump-Pence administration at the end of 2018, in a tweet on December 9, 2018. After Pence In August 2020, Ayers and Donald Trump Jr. sought to block the Pebble mine project in Alaska. Ayers wrote in a Aug. 4 tweet that, similar to \\"millions of conservationists and sportsmen,\\" he is hoping President Donald Trump will tell the Environmental Protection Agency to block the project, which has been a lightning rod for controversy for some two decades and has been widely assailed by numerous interest groups in Alaska and the lower states, and also faced opposition from many Alaskans. https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/politics/pebble-mine-donald-trump-jr- alaska/index.html Personal life Ayers lives in Atlanta with his wife Jamie (née Floyd), a former schoolteacher from Houston County, Georgia. They were married in May 2005. Mrs. Ayers is a second cousin of former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue. The Ayerses have triplets, born in December 2012.

Family and early life A postcard of Prince Alexander with his father. Prince Alexander of Prussia was born on 26 December 1912 to Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia and his wife Princess Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. August Wilhelm was a younger son of Kaiser Wilhelm II.de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. ‘’Le Petit Gotha’’. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery, Paris 2002, pp. 78, 93, 96-97 (French). His parents divorced in 1920 and his mother remarried less than two years later; custody of the young prince was awarded to Alexander's father. Alexander attended the 1932 wedding of the Swedish prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten with Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the former duchy of Coburg; it was the first time that a member of the German imperial family had entered the duchy since it became a republic, or specifically a part of Bavaria in November 1919 after the ruling duke, Carl Eduard, had ended his reign on 14 November 1918. Nazi party and military career As of November 1939, Prince Alexander was a first lieutenant in the Air Force Signal Corps, stationed in Wiesbaden. Like his father, who became a prominent supporter of the Nazi party, Alexander also became an early supporter. Prince August had secret hopes that Chancellor Adolf Hitler \\"would one day hoist him or his son Alexander up to the vacant throne of the Kaiser\\". The support father and son gave to the emerging party caused strong disagreements among the Hohenzollerns, with Wilhelm II urging them both to leave the Nazi party. In 1933 Alexander quit the SA and became a private in the German regular army. In 1934, Berlin reports leaked out that the prince quit the SA because Hitler had chosen 21-year-old Alexander to succeed him as \\"head man in Germany when he [Hitler] no longer can carry the torch\\". The report went on to say however that Joseph Goebbels was expected to oppose the prince's nomination. Unlike many German princes who became the targets of Hitler's mistrust and were removed from their commands in the military, Alexander was the only Hohenzollern allowed to remain at his post. Marriage On 19 December 1938 in the Dresden garrison church, Alexander non-dynastically married Armgard Weygand (22 August 1912 – 3 December 2001), daughter of Major Friedrich Weygand and Karla Franziska Oheim. She was the widow of a major in the German Air Force, and was originally from Wiesbaden, where Alexander Ferdinand was stationed. As the marriage had not been dynastically approved, none of his relatives attended the ceremony, but fellow officers served as witnesses. They had one son: *Prince Stephan Alexander Dieter Friedrich of Prussia (30 September 1939-12 February 1993); he married Heide Schmidt (born 6 February 1939) on 28 February 1964 and they were divorced in 1976. They have one daughter and four grandchildren. He remarried Hannelore-Maria Kerscher (born 26 October 1952) on 19 June 1981. **Princess Stephanie Viktoria-Luise of Prussia (21 September 1966); she married Amadi Mbaraka Bao (born in 1958 in Tanzania) on 19 April 1991. They were divorced on 20 July 1999. They have four children: *** Aaron Emanuel Bao (8 October 1994) *** Shoshana Twahia Sophie Bao (28 August 1996) *** Amir Joel Tumaini Bao (17 August 1998) *** Seraphine Bao (7 October 2002) Death Prince Alexander Ferdinand died on 12 June 1985 at Wiesbaden.

The game was developed and published independently by an American duo, Joe and Miranda Durbin. In May 2010, a second version of the game was released with completely different gameplay and graphics, named Horse Isle: Legend of the Esrohs, comprising two server options: Eternal and Life Cycle. This was followed up in August 2019 by a third version of the game: Horse Isle 3: Infinite Wilds, a downloadable 3D game that was designed to outlast Flash Player. Gameplay Horse Isle is set in a fictional world that centers on horses. The focus is on the individual player's capture and care of horses, mini-games, training, arena competitions and the dozens of horse breeds the game offers. The game includes parental filters, allowing it to appeal to users of all ages. In 2010, the game had a player base of around 10,000. The game is completely browser-based, but is a fully graphical online role-playing game. The artwork in Horse Isle (the first and second versions) has a 2D style with hand-drawn images. In Horse Isle 3, the game is three-dimensional and allows players to create avatars based on real-life appearances. The Horse Isle series uses educational elements involved as part of the game progression. These focus on reading comprehension, spelling, mathematics, science, and problem-solving.Super Smart Games, December 30th, 2007, \\" \\", Retrieved 11/19/2010 Horse Isle 1: The Secret Land of Horses Horse Isle 1: The Secret Land of Horses was the 2006 brainchild of Joe Durbin. The aim was to create a horse game that was geared towards girls, in order to get more girls into playing online games. It went live on May 3rd, 2007 after extensive beta-testing undertaken by the Durbins and volunteer players. The main features of this game included being able to catch wild horses, undertake fun and educational quests laid out by NPCs to earn money, compete in a number of competitions such as showjumping and racing, and chat with friends using the chat feature. Subscribed players were also able to own and build ranches, which increased the number of horses they could own as well as using features such as wells and training pens to water and train all their horses simultaneously. In 2015, the game withstood DDOS (distributed denial of service) attacks. However in 2020, with the Flash player that ran the game due to become unsupported and non-viable at the end of the year, Horse Isle 1 became the victim of several hacks, beginning in June and taking place periodically until October. With each of these hacks, the game's data became compromised and eventually unplayable. In October 2020, the game was declared unsustainable and labelled \\"end-of-life\\".  Horse Isle 2: Legend of the Esrohs  Horse Isle 2: Legend of the Esrohs was released in 2010 with a single server, allowing players from Horse Isle 1 who wished to experience a slightly different style of gameplay in a similar world. The map from the original game was enlarged, introducing many new 'isles' and towns for players to visit. Several elements of the original game were retained, including the ability to find and catch wild horses; quests given by NPCs; mining for valuable gems; and puzzles and riddles that were scattered around the world for players to complete as they came across them. In addition to the basic NPC quests, the game was given an overarching goal for players to work towards during gameplay. There were twelve \\"Esrohs\\" to find and undertake arduous quests for, each of which took a great deal of time and effort. This ensured that players would not soon become bored. Some NPCs in the world gave players clues during quests as to where and how to find the Esrohs, putting the onus on players to put the clues together and discover them themselves. A second server was added in 2012, comprising an additional option of breeding horses. The original server was renamed Eternal, with the second server becoming Life Cycle. This second server allowed players to breed their horses with the goal of improving stats for competitions. However, on Eternal, horses remained immortal with no breeding options. Players were thus given the choice between gameplay with immortal horses, or gameplay including breeding horses which had a set lifespan. Legend of the Esrohs was also a Flash-based game, which was slated to become non-viable at the end of 2020. As of October 2020, the game remains up and running, but is no longer updated.  Horse Isle 3: Infinite Wilds  In 2018, with the news that Flash Player would become unsupported at the end of 2020, Joe and Miranda began looking into options for a third game, which would be 3D, downloadable, and not at all reliant on Flash Player. Development was begun that same year, and in early- to mid-2019 several rounds of beta testing took place, undertaken by staff and volunteer players from the first two games. Horse Isle 3: Infinite Wilds went live in August 2019. It was a downloadable 3D version of the game, with several notable changes from the first two games. * Player avatars were now able to be customised to a real-life appearance, including hair and eye colour, body shape and clothing options. * There were no towns or 'isles' on a fixed map. Instead, players were able to create clubs for other players to join that became villages in their own right. The map was endless, and the onus was on players to set out and explore it themselves, with the map only revealing areas that had been explored by the player. * Competitions became entirely player-created, with the ability to chop wood and build jumps and obstacles. To this end, a range of competitions sprang up across the game, including showjumping, cross country, racing, dressage, and so on. * Players were able to buy and build ranches on as many different plots of land as they wished, allowing them to have barns and water towers (and so on) in different places around the world. * A second currency was introduced, named mobia, which was purchasable via the website using real money, or from other players in-game, and a higher premium was placed on this since it was used to unlock more valuable things in the game, such as equipment and ordering a horse. One notable difference between Horse Isle 3 and its older counterparts was the ability to access a large majority of the game without a subscription. On Horse Isle 3, subscriptions grant players with some small perks which in the long run are useful, but players can live without if they do not wish to subscribe. As of October 2020, the player-base was made up of 3,458 accounts, many of which were players returning from Horse Isle 1 and 2, with some new players joining since its August 2019 launch. Horse Isle 3: Infinite Wilds is expected to far outlast The Secret Land of Horses and Legend of the Esrohs, due to its non-reliance on Flash Player.

Early biography=Military career Alexander joined the army at a young age, and was attached to the headquarters of Crown Prince Frederick during the Austro-Prussian War. During the morning of the decisive battle of Königgrätz, a humorous account recounted that while on his horse, it ran away; Alexander was found later in the afternoon seated on the horse in a neighboring wood, stating that his horse had insisted on going there. He served as a general of infantry in the Prussian army. He was also a chief of the Third West Infantry Regiment and chief of the Second Regiment of Grenadiers of the Guard in the Landwehr. Later years In 1891, Alexander ended his cure at Marienbad and embarked for Ostend for three to four weeks. A contemporary figure once recounted that: > \\"The charitable disposition of Prince Alexander of Prussia, the Emperor's > cousin... is so well-known and often so appealed to in Berlin, that his > secretary must acquired great experience in answering begging questions. He > passes the greater part of the year in Switzerland and at Burg Rheinstein, > his castle on the Rhine\\". Traveling in Switzerland, Alexander liked to stay under the title Count de Tecklenburg. He was described as an \\"extraordinary pedestrian\\", because he \\"accomplished in twelve hours what the best walker in the valley takes sixteen hours to perform\\". In November 1852, Alexander went to visit his very ill friend the Duchess of Orleans at her estate at Lausanne, Switzerland, though she survived for six more years. Death and legacy In late December 1895, Alexander was reported to be \\"critically ill\\". He died at a quarter to eleven on 4 January 1896 after ailing for some time. The Emperor and Empress were at his bedside when he died. On 9 January, Alexander's funeral was held in a Berlin cathedral. Members of the Imperial court attended, including the Emperor and Empress, Dowager Empress Frederick, as well as members of the diplomatic corps and the Bundesrat, and a number of generals from the Germany army. His death sent the Berlin court into mourning for a month, causing the planned season's functions and court festivities to be altered. Hunting excursions prearranged for the month were also canceled. Some of the members of his entourage received quite substantial legacies, but the rest of his estate passed to his younger brother Prince George of Prussia, and after his death, to Alexander's godchild Prince Oskar of Prussia. Much was written about Alexander's supposedly promiscuous ways. In her 1915 work Memories of forty years, Catherine Radziwill recalled that: > \\"[Prince Alexander], though none too intelligent, was extremely fond of > society, feminine society in particular. I remember that one day, at my > mother-in-law's house, he managed to decoy into an empty room a certain > Madame von Wildenbruch, the wife of an illegitimate son of Prince Louis > Ferdinand of Prussia, and began kissing her with fervour, to the extreme > stupefaction and anger of the lady in question, who, it must be added, was > at that time nearly seventy years of age\\". Despite never marrying, another source said Alexander declared marriage to every woman he met, \\"no matter if she be princess or laundress, octogenarian or young girl, married or single\\".

He played for Wanderers in the 1872 FA Cup Final and was also chosen to represent England on several occasions. Early life Hooman was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the son of a carpet manufacturer. He attended Charterhouse School and represented the school at cricket. Football career Hooman played football for Wanderers, one of the leading clubs of the 1870s, as a forward. He was described by contemporary commentators as \\"the fastest dribbler of the day, and an accomplished player\\". In 1871 he was chosen to play for the England national team in two matches against Scotland at The Oval, although these matches are not now regarded as official international matches by The Football Association. He was also chosen to play in what is now regarded as the first official international match, between England and Scotland in Glasgow in 1872, but was unavailable due to other commitments. He was also selected for teams representing Middlesex and London. Hooman played for Wanderers in the 1872 FA Cup Final, the final of the first FA Cup competition, and helped his team to a 1–0 victory over Royal Engineers. He was still playing for the club a year later, when Wanderers played in the 1873 Final, but was unavailable on the day of the final. Outside football Hooman also competed in various other sports, representing England in athletics and rowing at the Henley Royal Regatta. He was also adept at boxing and golf. He went into business as a merchant ship broker and later as a manufacturer of Portland cement. His son Charles (born 1887), played for Kent County Cricket Club and played golf for Britain and Ireland in the first two Walker Cup competitions in the early 1920s. Death Hooman died in Hythe, Kent at the age of 87 following an operation. His obituary was published in The Times, and contained the claim that he had scored the winning goal in the 1872 Cup final. This contradicts all known contemporary newspaper reports on the match, all of which state that Morton Betts scored the Wanderers' goal. The obituary also contained other statements about the match, drawn from a recent interview with Hooman, which are demonstrably incorrect, suggesting that the claim concerning the goal was also drawn from Hooman's reminiscences and that at his advanced age he was confusing the final with another match in which he played.

Once a highway has been decommissioned, the highway is turned over to the local county or city that it is in, they are then responsible for all maintenance on the former highway. All former highways are codified in Washington law under the Revised Code of Washington, chapter 47.17, section 420. State Route 30 State Route 30 was a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, running from Tonasket to Tiger. In 1973, the highway was renumbered as part of State Route 20. State Route 95State Route 110State Route 111 Temporary State Route 111 was a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, running from Hurricane Ridge in the Olympic National Park to US 101. State Route 113 The portion of Washington State Route 20 within Jefferson and Island Counties was once known as SR 113. State Route 126 SR 126 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of US 12. It started at US 12 (at Dayton), then headed east to US 12 again (near Pomeroy), where it ended. In January 1964, SSH 3L became SR 126. SR 126 was dropped out of the system in 1992 because it was mostly very steep and unpaved. The approximate route follows Patit Road, Hartstock Grade Road, Tucannon Road, Blind Grade Road, Linville Gulch Road, and Tatman Mountain Road. State Route 131 SR 131 was a section of what is now known as US 97, north of Ellensburg. State Route 140State Route 143State Route 151State Route 209 State Route 209 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of U.S. Route 2. It started at SR 207 in Lake Wenatchee State Park and went east to the community of Plain and then south to U.S. Route 2 near Leavenworth. In January 1964, SSH 15C became SR 209 and SR 207. SR 209 was removed in 1992. State Route 220State Route 232 State Route 232 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of State Route 23. It started at SR 231 and went east to U.S. Route 395. In 1967, SSH 3U became SR 232. SR 232 was later removed in 1992. State Route 237State Route 251State Route 294State Route 306 State Route 306 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of State Route 3. It started at SR 303 and went east to Illahee State Park. In 1964, part of SSH 21B became SR 306. SR 306 was later removed in 1993. State Route 311State Route 402State Route 403State Route 407 State Route 407 was an auxiliary route of SR 4 that connected Cathlament to Elochoman State Forest. It was previously designated as SSH 12D prior to the 1964 renumbering and was removed as a state highway in 1992. State Route 431 State Route 431 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of State Route 4. It started at SR 4 and went north to I-5. In 1964, a branch of PSH 12 became SR 831. SR 831 was an auxiliary route of U.S. Route 830 and the route was switched to the current designation of SR 4 in 1967. SR 431 was later removed in 1992. State Route 514 SR 514 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of Interstate 5. It started at SR 99 in Fife, then headed east to SR 161, where it ended in Milton. In January 1964, SSH 1X became SR 514. On April 1, 1992, SR 514 became defunct. State Route 537State Route 540 SR 540 was a state route in the U.S. state of Washington. It was an auxiliary route of Interstate 5. It started at the Lummi Indian Reservation, then headed east to I-5, where it ended. In January 1964, SSH 1Z became SR 540. In 1984, SR 540 became defunct. State Route 603State Route 901 SR 901 was created in 1964 from Secondary State Highway 2D. At the time of its creation, SR 901 began at the intersection of Lake Washington Boulevard and State Route 520, on the border of Kirkland and Bellevue. It then traveled north along Lake Washington Blvd. to downtown Kirkland. At the intersection of Lake St. and Central Way, SR 901 turned right, traveling east along Central Way. It then continued as Redmond Way into Redmond turning south onto West Lake Sammamish Parkway when the roads intersected. It then followed West Lake Sammamish Parkway into Issaquah, ending at its intersection with State Route 900. SR 901 also had a spur leading from West Lake Sammamish Parkway into downtown Redmond along Redmond Way. In 1971, SR 901 was broken into two parts. The western part, from SR 520 to the intersection of Redmond Way and West Lake Sammamish Parkway (including the spur into Redmond), was renamed State Route 908. The remainder retained the SR 901 designation, with one exception; West Lake Sammamish Parkway lost its state route designation from Exit 13 of Interstate 90 to its intersection with SR 900. Effective April 1, 1992, SR 901's path was changed again; now it ran through the city of Sammamish along East Lake Sammamish Parkway from Front Street in Issaquah to State Route 202 east of downtown Redmond. In June, SR 901 was completely dropped as a state route in Washington. State Route 908State Route 920 State Route 920 (SR 920) was the temporary designation for a section of SR 520 bypassing downtown Redmond. It was created in 1975 and opened in July 1977, connecting SR 901 to SR 202. Four years after the missing link in SR 520 was completed in 1981, SR 920 was deleted from the state highway system.

The series, which was shown on BBC television in 1989, is an adaptation of two of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia novels: Prince Caspian (1951) and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952). Plot=Prince CaspianEpisode 1= The four Pevensie children are waiting at a train station when a magical force pulls them into Narnia. They land at an overgrown castle which they recognise as Cair Paravel. Susan saves the life of a dwarf named Trumpkin who is about to be drowned by two soldiers on a boat. The children tell him that they are the old Kings and Queens of Narnia, of which Trumpkin has heard of in the Narnian legends. Trumpkin tells the children the story of Prince Caspian, nephew of the current monarch, King Miraz. Caspian lived in a great castle with King Miraz and his wife Queen Prunaprismia. He has a tutor called Dr. Cornelius who one night woke him up because the Queen had given birth to a baby; with a direct heir, Miraz no longer needs Caspian, and planned to kill him. Caspian escaped on a horse but fell from it in the woods and was taken in by Trumpkin, a badger called Trufflehunter and a black dwarf called Nikabrik. These are people who live in hiding, because King Miraz hates the Old Narnians; his ancestors defeated them in their invasion of Narnia hundreds of years earlier. The children travel through the woods with Trumpkin to meet Caspian. =Episode 2= That night, Lucy wakes up from sleep, hearing someone calling her name. She realises that it is Aslan, who instructs the others to follow him. The children meet Aslan the next morning at the Stone Table, and he takes them to meet the Old Narnians and Prince Caspian. Nikabrik summons a Hag and a Werewolf, intending to resurrect the White Witch so she can kill Miraz; when the children arrive, Nikabrik, the Hag, and the Werewolf are killed, but Caspian is wounded. Peter sends a letter of challenge to King Miraz and the guard who gave it to him is Glozelle, one of the King's courtiers who along with Sopespian has been conspiring against the King. Miraz then has an argument with his two courtiers, initially intending to refuse the challenge, but Glozelle and Sopespian trick him into accepting the offer. Peter fights Miraz and in the struggle he stabs him. Miraz lies wounded on the floor and Glozelle finishes him off by stabbing him in the back with a knife. A battle is bought briefly, during which Peter kills Glozelle. A brave mouse called Reepicheep has his tail cut off but Aslan restores it in recognition of his bravery. Aslan also names Caspian as the King of Narnia, and peace is restored between all Narnians. The four Pevensies return home, with Aslan telling them that Peter and Susan will not return, but Edmund and Lucy will. The Voyage of the Dawn TreaderEpisode 1= When the story opens, it is explained that Peter is working at Professor Kirke's house, Susan has been invited to America for a holiday, and the younger two, Edmund and Lucy, are staying at their cousin Eustace Scrubb's home. Sitting in their temporary room, they both comment on a picture on the wall, how it resembles a Narnian ship. Eustace enters the room, and all three are sucked into the painting. On board the ship the Dawn Treader, Edmund and Lucy are reunited with Caspian who has grown into a young man since they last saw him. He explains that he is on a quest to find seven lords who were friends of his father's. The quest requires them to sail through dangerous waters, encountering new islands where things are not what they seem and finally to sail to the end of the world, hoping to reach Aslan's Land. The first island they encounter is one of the Lone Islands, where they are captured by slave traders, but are rescued the next day when Caspian and his army arrive at the market (having already deposed Governor Gumpus) and announce the abolition of slavery in Narnia. Caspian had already been bought by a man who introduced himself as Lord Bern (one of the missing lords). =Episode 2= They later find an isolated island which appears to be uninhabited. Eustace wanders off and finds a cave where a dragon has died. The cave is full of gold and jewellery, and Eustace finds a bracelet which he puts on. He is tired and soon falls asleep, but when he wakes up he soon realises that he has metamorphosised into a dragon. He flies back to the beach where the others confront him, and they soon figure out who he is. He is soon turned back into a human by Aslan. Caspian establishes that the bracelet was a possession of Lord Octesian, who must have perished on that island. =Episode 3= The third island (Caspian declares it \\"Goldwater Island,\\" but Reepicheep proposes the more apt name of \\"Deathwater Island\\") where they find a cavern in which there is a pool. Edmund places his sword in the water to measure its depth, only for it to become heavy and fall in the water – causing it to splash over his shoes and produce splashes of gold. There is a body in the water, and they establish that anyone or anything that ends up in the water turns into gold. Caspian later realises that the body in the water is that of Lord Restimar. On the fourth island, they encounter some invisible creatures who give them dinner at a large house. A magician called Coriakin appears after Lucy reads from a magic book, and the creatures are soon made visible again. =Episode 4= The fifth and final island is at the end of the world. Before they ascend the island, they find a man in the water who introduced himself as Lord Rhoop. On the island they meet Ramandu and his daughter, and also find the three remaining Lords who are in an enchanted sleep. The three children eventually return home, and before leaving they know that Caspian will marry the daughter of Ramandu, who lives on an island at the end of the world, and that the four lords who were in a deep sleep on Ramandu's island will awaken. Aslan also told Edmund and Lucy that they will not return to Narnia since they are getting too old. Cast *Warwick Davis as Reepicheep *Jonathan R.

Human trafficking has often had a negative connotation, and has been viewed as an unwanted activity by different countries around the world. These countries have formed organizations, laws, and educational programs geared towards the prevention of human trafficking. Having many countries involved in the prevention of human trafficking gives this subject a transnational approach. In this article, transnational will be defined as an issue that crosses international boundaries that multiple nations are experiencing and addressing at the same time. This article will focus on the transnational efforts to prevent human trafficking. Different countries have had different approaches when attempting to prevent human trafficking. Both governmental and non- governmental organizations have been created to combat the issue at hand. Governmental agencies are groups which are funded, ran, and recognized by the government. Non-governmental organizations are formations of people who have the same interests and are run independently away from the government. Law and legislation have been enacted in a variety of countries dealing directly with the prevention of human trafficking. These laws range from making prostitution illegal or prosecuting those who are caught trafficking human beings, to protecting those people who have been trafficked. Governmental and non- governmental organizations have both published and provided educational material about human trafficking to those who wish to read it. Training manuals, textbooks, and pamphlets have been printed in many different languages in many different countries on the subject of human trafficking and its prevention.  Transnational efforts  Across the world an increasing number of humans are being trafficked. Trying to control this rapid trend many countries have formed governmental and non-governmental organizations to help combat trafficking. Laws and regulations that prevent trafficking are springing up worldwide. Groups are informing those who are unaware of the effects and consequences of human trafficking; involving the traffickers and those who are being trafficked. Laws are prosecuting those who participate in trafficking; the traffickers and sometimes those who are trafficked depending on what country you are located in. In select countries, rehabilitation and counseling is available for those who have been trafficking and wish for help. Each country has different rules, regulations and organizations involving human trafficking. Therefore, it is necessary to examine each country individually to understand their efforts to prevent human trafficking. Below is a time line for each country to show their transnational effort to prevent human trafficking.  Africa  Founded in 1987 ESAM, Enfants Solidaires d'Afrique et du Monde, is a nonprofit organization formed to “fight the abuse and neglect of children, young people, and women” Based in Benin, West Africa this charity was officially recognized on May 17, 1990. In September 1996 a nongovernmental organization in Nigeria, the Constitutional Rights Project, produced a report titled ‘Modernized Slavery- Child Trade in Nigeria’. This reports main focus was on the trafficking of children in Nigeria; bringing attention to trafficking in the area.Dottridge, Mike. “Trafficking in children in West and Central Africa,” Gender and Development, 10(1): 41 Around the same time, WAO Afrique, World Association for Orphans, started investigating human child trafficking as well. WAO Afrique is a nongovernmental organization based in Lomé, Togo. In July 1998, UNICEF held a workshop on ‘trafficking in child domestic workers in particular girls of domestic service in west and central Africa.’ In December 2001, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) produced a plan of action against trafficking. This plan includes procedures when dealing with the traffickers and the victims of trafficking. ECOWAS has set up a fund for the victims of human trafficking.United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. “Assistance for the Implementation of the ECOWAS Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons Training Manual,” United Nations, 2006.  Australia  In 1994, Australia passed the Child Sex Tourism Act. This act prohibits any citizens or residents of Australia to engage in any sexual activity or intercourse with any person under the age of sixteen anywhere in the world.Australian Government. “Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994,” COMLAW (Commonwealth of Australia Law) 1994.  Brazil  Two states in Brazil, Pernambuco and Bahia, have implemented a Specialized Criminal Justice of Childhood and Youths legislation. This legislation is aimed at prosecuting and judging crimes against children and adolescents.Jullien, Karene. “The Recent International Efforts to End Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children,” Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, 2003. The Brazilian Criminal Law code outlines the standards on the trafficking of women in chapter five articles 227, 228, and 231. In June 2000, the government created a Plan for Combating the Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents. This plan has become the national guide for sexual violence and protecting the rights of children.Federative Republic of Brazil. “Answers to the List of issues to be taken up by Prof. Dr. Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro in charge with the United Nations Secretary – General’s Global Study on Violence against Children,”2004.  Cambodia  In 2007, the nongovernmental organization named ChildSafe opened a center in Phnom Penh open twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. This center invites children who are abused or at risk to be abused for support, counseling, medical assistance, and police complaints. ChildSafe also has a hot-line that is open at all times to report a child who is at risk for being trafficked.  France  France prohibits trafficking for sexual exploitation through Article 225 of its penal code. The French Government provided the victims of trafficking, which cooperated with authorities in the investigation and prosecution of all those involved in trafficking, witness protection services and issued residency permits. ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism) France, a non-governmental organization, established in 1992 is aimed at preventing child prostitution and trafficking not only in France, but around the world. France's Respect for Human Rights Policies, section 6: Worker Rights, sub section f: Trafficking in Persons states, the laws that most Pimps and Traffickers are usually punished under, “aiding, abetting, or protecting the prostitution of another person; obtaining a profit, sharing proceeds, or receiving subsidies from someone engaged in prostitution; or employing, leading, corrupting, or pressuring someone into prostitution.”Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. State Department. “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,” 2004. Several of France's law enforcement agencies are involved combating human trafficking. In 2007, the French government increased its efforts in protecting and assisting victims of sex trafficking. The Government provided non-governmental organizations with money for protection services, which include medical care, legal counsel, shelter, and psychological counseling.  Greece  Law No. 3064/2002, passed in 2002, states that trafficking for the purpose of sexual or labor exploitation is illegal. Included in this law are provisions for the trafficking victims such as shelter and legal help. An additional law passed in 2005 allows a period of 30 days for the trafficked victim to decide whether to take part in the prosecution of their traffickers. If they choose to assist, the victims are able to obtain healthcare and social services. If they choose not to partake in the prosecution, they do not receive these services. In order to combat the increased number of minors being trafficked from Albania to Greece, Law No. 3625/2007 passed in 2007 creating harsher penalties for those trafficking minors. In 2008, Law No. 3692/2008 was enacted as an agreement between Albania and Greece to cooperate in regards to minors who are trafficked between the two countries.  India  Founded in 2007, Odanadi Seva Trust is a community base organization that attempts to fight human trafficking in India. This organization is based in Mysore, South India and attempts to put an end to trafficking by rescue operations, rehabilitation, and education.  Serbia  Serbian legislative Article 388 explicitly defines the term \\"human trafficking\\" and makes it distinct from smuggling. This Article also places higher penalties on those found trafficking minors. While Article 388 defines human trafficking, Article 390 explicitly states that trafficking and any other form of slavery is illegal in Serbia.  Sri Lanka  In 1995, Sri Lanka created a special task force to study human trafficking. However, in 1997 the task force was replaced by a presidential task force. In 1998 the Child Protection Authority, CPA, was enacted. The CPA held on to all previous laws protecting the rights of children from unlawful abuse. These laws make trafficking and any other form of abuse illegal, even during war.  Sweden  In Sweden, the government has created a law that “prohibits the purchase of sexual services.” This law makes it illegal for men to buy prostitutes. By passing this law on January 1, 1999, Sweden was also helping to prevent the international prostitution and human trafficking. This law helped to stop trafficking in Sweden by arresting and prosecution the male purchasers not the female victims. There has been a reduction in the number of prostitutes in Sweden since 2004. Swedish citizens can be prosecuted for purchasing sexual services anywhere in the world if the country in which they did it criminalise it.Ekberg, Gunilla. “Swedish Law that Prohibits the Purchase of Sexual Services: Best Practices for Prevention of Prostitution and Trafficking of Human Beings,” Violence Against Women, 2004.  Thailand  Since 1956 prostitution in Thailand has been illegal. In May 1990, ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism) Thailand was established by churches, women's rights organizations, and charitable services. In 1996 the government of Thailand sanctioned the Prostitution Prevention and Suppression Act. This act allows the parents who sell their children into the sex trade to be prosecuted. The Prostitution Prevention and Suppression Act also prosecutes the individuals who are having sexual intercourse with the children involved in the sex trade. In 1997, the Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Women and Children Act increased consequences of those who are found guilty of abducting women and children from China, Laos, Burma, or Cambodia to Thailand for slave labor or prostitution. In 1998, the education requirement for children was pushed up from six years to nine.  United Kingdom  In 1997, the Sex Offenders Act broadened certain legislation to include residents and citizens of Great Britain implicated with sex tourism. The act also made it a crime to travel overseas with the intention to partake in sex tourism. The Crimestoppers hot-line is a free hot-line for British tourists to “report child abuse abroad”.  United States  The Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution was added to the United States Constitution and ratified on December 6, 1865, making slavery and the trafficking of Humans in America illegal. In 1994, Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was passed. Under this Act, it is illegal for a citizen of the United States to travel abroad with the intention of engaging in sex tourism. The penalties for breaching this act include a fine and/or up to ten years of imprisonment. In 1996, the United States took part in the ECPAT World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. In 2000, the United States passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act.Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 In 2001, America also joined in the Second World Congress held in Japan. In 2004, Hawaii passed Act 82 of the House Bill 2020, making “the promotion of travel for the purpose of prostitution a felony and grounds for revoking the license of an offending travel agent.”  Organizations and agencies  This is an alphabetical list of the Governmental and Non-Governmental Organizations, from the countries listed above, and the things that they are doing to help prevent human trafficking. A Governmental Organization is an organization that is formed, funded, and run by the government. A Non-Governmental Organization is an organization that is run independently away from the government.  Governmental  National Child Protection Authority or the CPA was established in Sri Lanka. Their mission states: ::In relation to child abuse and exploitation, to create awareness and improve knowledge, undertake training and skills development, recommend legal reform and monitor law enforcement, undertake special investigations and provide legal support, strengthen the infrastructure to prevent abuse in families, communities, schools and institutions, establish a comprehensive data base including a cyber-watch, undertake relevant research and coordinate the key sectors involved in child abuse and exploitation namely Probation and Child Care Services, Justice and Law Enforcement authorities, Defense, Health, Education and Samurdhi as well as the NGO and INGO networks.  Nongovernmental  ChildSafe, formerly known as Alamo Children's Advocacy Center, is stationed in Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. ChildSafe's mission is to “restore dignity, trust and hope to children traumatized by sexual abuse.” The Constitutional Right Project (CRP) is located in Nigeria and was established in November 1990. The main purpose of this organization is to protect people's human rights and to make sure people abide by Nigerian Laws. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was founded in 1975. Its mission is to “promote economic integration in \\"all fields of economic activity, particularly industry, transport, telecommunications, energy, agriculture, natural resources, commerce, monetary and financial questions, social and cultural matters ...\\" End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT) was established in 1992. Stationed in Bangkok Thailand, ECPAT's mission statement is “ECPAT International is a global network of organizations and individuals working together for the elimination of child prostitution, child pornography and the trafficking of children for sexual purposes. It seeks to encourage the world community to ensure that children everywhere enjoy their fundamental rights free and secure from all forms of commercial sexual exploitation.” Enfants Solidaires d'Afrique et du Monde (ESAM) is based in Benin, West Africa. ESAM was officially recognized May 17, 1990. Odanadi-UK is based in Mysore, South India. Founded in 2007, Odanadi-UK's objectives are “to prevent, tackle and eliminate human trafficking and sexual exploitation.” World Association for Orphans (WAO Afrique) is based in Lomé, Togo. United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has published three textbooks dealing with combating trafficking in children. MANNA Freedom is the human trafficking prevention arm of MANNA Worldwide and provides awareness, resources and homes for at-risk children and teens.  Laws  This is a list of laws and legislation that have been passed by different countries to combat human trafficking. Most of these laws have come into effect because of non- governmental organizations and the country's specific experiences with human trafficking. As time goes on, and there are more people involved in human trafficking awareness will be raised and more laws will be put into effect. *In 1994, Australia passed the Child Sex Tourism Act. *National Child protection Authority Act of 1998 *Since 1956 prostitution in Thailand has been illegal. *In 1996 the government of Thailand sanctioned the Prostitution Prevention and Suppression Act. *In 1997, the Sex Offenders Act in Britain *Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution “The Constitution of the United States,” Amendment 13. *Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in the United States *Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 *In 2004, Hawaii passed Act 82 of the House Bill 2020, making “the promotion of travel for the purpose of prostitution a felony and grounds for revoking the license of an offending travel agent.”  Educational materials  Governmental and non-governmental organizations have been making great strides in providing information on human trafficking in today's society. Pamphlets, handbooks, websites, and handouts focusing on human trafficking have been made readily available for the public. UNICEF has published three textbooks, with the assistance of Dr. Gilly McKenzie, an expert in Trafficking and Organised Crime, involving child trafficking. Textbook One is titled Understanding Child Trafficking. This textbook includes the National Action Plans on child trafficking; focusing on attempts and ideas to eliminate child trafficking. This textbook states that coordination among groups is necessary to help combat human trafficking.Organization, International Labor. Understanding Child Trafficking, Geneva: International Labor Office, 2009. Textbook Two is titled Action against child trafficking at policy and outreach levels. This textbook discusses assistance for the victims, law enforcement, and prevention. Each section clearly states what governments, non-governmental organizations, and worker's organizations can do to help combat human trafficking.Organization, International Labor. Action Against Child Trafficking at Policy and Outreach Levels, Geneva: International Labor Office, 2009. Textbook Three is titled The Matters of Process. This book talks about ways to provide education to children and young adults in order to prevent them from going into or being a part of human trafficking. Media and social dialogues are being used to get this information to children and young adults.Organization, International Labor. The Matters of Process, Geneva: International Labor Office, 2009. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime published a training manual, by Dr. Gilly McKenzie, titled Assistance for the Implementation of the ECOWAS Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons. This manual is focused on human trafficking in West Africa; giving protection and support for those who have previously been trafficked. According to the manual, materials to raise awareness about trafficking will be readily available for those who wish to receive them. This training manual defines human trafficking and shows the differences between human trafficking and migrant smuggling.United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

It is dedicated to Hungarian virtuoso violinist Joseph Szigeti, a close friend of Bartók, who gave the first performance of the orchestra version in Königsberg on 1 November 1929, with Hermann Scherchen conducting the orchestra . Bartók evidently composed both rhapsodies purely as a personal gesture, rather than on commission, and did so without telling anyone until they were both completed . According to the violinist Zoltán Székely, he and the composer met one day in 1928 and, after chatting for a time, Bartók suddenly announced that he had a surprise for him, and produced the manuscripts of the two rhapsodies, which no one else had previously seen. \\"One is for you; one is for Szigeti,\\" Bartók told him. “You may choose which one you like for the dedication.” Székely chose the Second Rhapsody, but quickly added, \\"that doesn’t mean that the First Rhapsody was already dedicated to Szigeti!\\" . Both rhapsodies exemplify a mode of composition using peasant-music sources, described by Bartók as taking an existing melody and adding an accompaniment together with some introductory or ending material, in such a way that the newly composed matter is strictly secondary—never competing with the folk material for prominence. This was acknowledged in the scores of the early editions, which bore the subtitle \\"Folk Dances\\" . Bartók's objective was to transplant the entire style of Eastern-European fiddle playing into the Western concert context. In order to further this project, he insisted that Szigeti listen to the original field recordings from which the melodies were transcribed . The Rhapsody uses the same slow–fast (lassú—friss) paired movements of the popular Hungarian verbunkos (recruiting dance) found in the earlier Rhapsody for Piano of 1904, and to which he would later return in the first movement of Contrasts in 1938 . Bartók specified that each of the movements can be performed separately—not only the fast second movement but also the more serious slow opening movement of each rhapsody . Analysis The first movement is in ternary form (ABA′, plus a coda), the main theme of which begins with a rising-scale violin melody heavily laden with Gypsy influences, including the characteristic dotted rhythms. This is a Romanian fiddle tune from Mureş County, Transylvania . It is in the Lydian mode, first occurring on G, with a drone-like accompaniment in the piano part. When it returns in the third section, it is transposed to C . The contrasting, middle section of the movement is a mournful one, characterized by short-long figurations. This is the only Hungarian melody used in either of the two rhapsodies, a Transylvanian fiddle tune called the Lament of Árvátfalva recorded by Béla Vikár and later transcribed by Bartók . The coda briefly returns to a fragment of this lament, ending with the marking Fermata breve; poi attacca (\\"pause briefly, then connect to the next movement\\") . The second movement is in \\"chain form\\", featuring a succession of five independent melodies with \\"no attempt whatever to create structure or integration\\"—apart from an overall accelerando . It possesses an air of brilliance, exhibiting the most virtuosic and vibrant dance melodies. In the published score, Bartók provided two alternative endings. The first, longer version brings back the main theme from the first movement, in the original G Lydian tonality, and finishes with a ten-bar, cadenza-like flourish. The second, shorter ending does not recall material from the lassú, but instead is based on the E major first theme of the second movement, now transposed to A major. When the second movement is played on its own, this shorter ending is obligatory .

It is intended as a general research tool, available beyond the present project for applied and theoretical linguistic research. It started as a PhD research project at the Department of Linguistics, University of Carthage, in 2006 by Dr. Hammouda Salhi (), in collaboration with some of his students, and completed in 2010. The whole description of the corpus was completed in 2009 and revised in 2010. The EAPCOUNT project comes as a response to the unsatisfactory performance of general-purpose dictionaries (Zanettin, 2009), especially when it comes to translation studies and comparative research involving Arabic. It was also motivated by the increasing demands for cross- lingual research and information retrieval (Salhi, 2010). The EAPCOUNT comprises 341 texts aligned on a paragraph basis, which means texts in English along with their translational counterparts in Arabic. It consists of two subcorpora; one contains the English originals and the other their Arabic translations. As for the English subcorpus, it contains 3,794,677 word tokens, with 78,606 word types. The Arabic subcorpus has a slightly fewer word tokens (3,755,741), yet differs greatly in terms of the number of word types, which is 143,727. This means that the whole corpus contains 7,550,418 tokens. Texts included in the EAPCOUNT The EAPCOUNT consists mainly, but not exclusively, of resolutions and annual reports issued by different UN organizations and institutions. Some texts are taken from the authoritative publications of another UN-like institution, namely the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU); representing 2.18% of the total number of tokens in the English subcorpus. But the great majority of texts are issued by the General Assembly and Security Council (66.44% SL tokens). The assumption here is that TL texts produced by these selected international bodies can be considered as translations of a high degree of reliability. All texts have been downloaded from first-hand sources (official websites of these agencies) in order to make sure that the publications are all kept in their original form. Time-frame The EAPCOUNT texts cover a time-frame of about 14 years. The EAPCOUNT can be taken as a synchronic corpus, even though Meyer (2002:46) maintains that “a time-frame of 5 to 10 years seems reasonable” for a corpus to fit into the category of synchronic corpora. This is because almost all original texts and translations are issued by the same bodies and are governed by strict norms and standards of writing and translation, which may arguably mean that language change happens at a slower pace. In addition, 22.6% of the texts were produced in 2009, 16% in 2007, and 13.4% in 2005, and 93.87% of the texts were produced over a period of 9 years, namely from 2001 to 2009, or within the reasonable time-frame set by Meyer for a synchronic corpus.

It was built on the same site as its predecessor, Copenhagen Castle, which had assumed a monstrous appearance and started to crumble under its own weight after several extensions. The palace existed for just under half a century since it was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1794. The surviving parts, which included the show grounds, the court theatre and the Marble Bridge with its two pavilions, were incorporated into the second Christiansborg Palace which succeeded it. These parts also survived the fire of 1884 which destroyed the second palace and are now part of the present day Christiansborg Palace which houses both the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court and Prime Minister's Office. History=Construction of the new palace Demolition of the overextended and antiquated Copenhagen Castle began in 1731 to make room for the new palace which was named Christiansborg after its founder. The king commissioned architect Elias David Häusser to build the new palace. Construction of the magnificent new palace began in 1733. From 1736 the younger architects Lauritz de Thurah and Nicolai Eigtved were put in charge of designing the interior. In 1738 a palace commission was set up to supervise the construction. Work only progressed slowly due to lack of funds and on several occasions threatened to come to a complete standstill. However, by 1740 the main wing was partially ready for use and Christian VI took up residence at a grandiose ceremony on 26 November 1740. When Häusser retired from the project in 1742, Eigtved was charged with completing the palace. This happened in 1745. The palace commission was dissolved on 22 February 1745. The total costs of the new palace were 2.7 million Rigsdaler, the equivalent to half of the state's annual income. The fire of 1794 On 26 February 1794, Christiansborg Palace was devastated by a fire. It began in an overheated stove close to the Grand Hall. Architecture and artworks Plan drawing of the first Christiansborg Overall layout The palace complex, which was in Rococo style, consisted of a four-winged main building connected to various other buildings, including a court theatre and stables, arranged around large show grounds. There was also an attached chapel located at the site of the present-day Christiansborg Chapel. It was the largest palace in Europe for a short while, until the fire destroyed it. The main approach to the palace was across the still existing Marble Bridge, today located on the rear side of present-day Christiansborg, and the show grounds. Main building The main building stood 36 metres high with a copper-clad roof and an 84 metre high steepled tower located above the main entrance facing the show grounds. The façade was covered in sandstone and lavishly decorated with vases, reliefs, sculptures and ornamental details on cornices and window frames. The interior was also in Rococo style and lavishly decorated. Work on producing artworks and decorations for the palace continued throughout the reign of Frederick V, and the Grand Hall, which was designed by Nicolas-Henri Jardin, was not inaugurated until 10 November 1766 by Christian VII. Among the artists who had their breakthrough with their contributions to the palace are the painters Nikolaj Abildgaard and Hendrick Krock and the sculptors Johannes Wiedewelt, Simon Stanley and Johan Mandelberg.

It was composed in 1928 and orchestrated in 1929. The orchestral version was revised in 1935, and the version with piano in 1945. It is dedicated to Hungarian violinist Zoltán Székely, who later became the first violinist of the Hungarian String Quartet in 1937, two years after the founding of the ensemble. Bartók evidently composed both rhapsodies purely as a personal gesture, rather than on commission, and did so without telling anyone until they were both completed . According to Székely, he and the composer met one day in 1928 and, after chatting for a time, Bartók suddenly announced that he had a surprise for him, and produced the manuscripts of the two rhapsodies, which no one else had previously seen. \\"One is for you; one is for Szigeti,\\" Bartók told him. “You may choose which one you like for the dedication.” Székely chose the Second Rhapsody . Both of the rhapsodies exemplify a mode of composition using peasant-music sources, described by Bartók as taking an existing melody and adding an accompaniment together with some introductory or ending material, in such a way that the newly composed matter is strictly secondary—never competing with the folk material for prominence . The Rhapsody uses the same slow–fast (lassú—friss) paired movements of the popular Hungarian verbunkos (recruiting dance) found in the earlier Rhapsody for Piano of 1904, and to which he would return in the first movement of Contrasts in 1938 . The title, 'Rhapsody', is a reference to the dramatic contrasts between the movements. Bartók specified that each of the movements can be performed separately—not only the fast second movement but also the more serious slow opening movement . Analysis The opening lassú section presents three themes arranged in a rondo or five-part song form: ABACA. Although mainly in D minor, the opening section emphasizes the fifth scale degree so strongly as to suggest a sort of Phrygian mode on A, and the movement closes with a cadence on A, and the instruction Fermata breve, poi attacca (pause briefly, then connect to the next movement). As in the First Rhapsody, the following friss movement is an informal chain form, here consisting of seven folk themes—six Transylvanian Gypsy fiddle dances and one Ruthenian dance (the fifth tune, Uvevanẙi) from Szeklence in Máramaros County . These seven dances are arranged into thirteen sections in various quick tempos, producing the impression of perpetual exposition. The movement begins in G, but is primarily anchored in D (with prominent use of the closely related acoustic and Lydian scales), and concludes in that key. Bartók appears to have been dissatisfied with the original ending, as published in 1929, and made as many as seven tentative alternatives, finally publishing one of them as definitive (; ). Other features of the piece include open-interval harmonies, drones, fiery rhythms and folk melodies.

History  The origins of Julie are uncertain but recent genetic studies show that it possibly descended from cultivars introduced to the Caribbean through Jamaica from Réunion,http://caribfruits.cirad.fr/content/download/936/6182/file/Genetic%20diversity%20of%20Carribbean%20mangoes.pdf although its monoembryonic trait suggests it is descended from the Indian line of mangoes. Julie was recognized for its outstanding flavor and dwarf growth habit. It was introduced to the United States via south Florida by Lawrence Zill,http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/mango_ars.html a nurseryman and horticulturalist known for producing new mango varieties. Several Florida varieties are descended directly or indirectly from Julie, including 'Sophie Fry', 'Gary' and 'Carrie'. Julie is also the parent of 'Graham', a variety from Trinidad. The cultivar proved to be difficult to adapt to the humid climate of Florida, however, and was very susceptible to fungus, making it unsuitable for commercial growing. Nevertheless, the variety was sold as nursery stock for home growing and continues to be done so on a limited scale. It remains a popular variety in the West Indies, where it is often referred to as 'Saint Julian' mango.

They were the 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 National Champions of the new American Basketball Association (ABA), which they joined as an expansion team for the 2010–2011 season. They play most home games at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena. In addition to their six national championships, the Giants won regional titles in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2014, the team was recognized for their off-the-court achievements with the ABA National Charity Award for their work in the Jacksonville community. History In May 2010 the American Basketball Association announced a new franchise based in Jacksonville would join the league for the 2010–2011 season. The name was announced as the Jacksonville Giants in November. The owner was Jacksonville attorney Ron Sholes, while the head coach and general manager was Kevin Waters, who previously owned and coached the Jacksonville Bluewaves of the World Basketball Association. Jacksonville was home to an earlier ABA team, the Jacksonville Jam. The Jam played in the ABA for the 2006–2007 season before moving to the rival Premier Basketball League in 2008, but folded by the end of the season. 2010–2011 In 2010 owner Sholes stated that he hoped to avoid the fate of the Jam and other minor league basketball teams that have failed in Jacksonville with a more professional marketing strategy. He signed a contract with the city's major indoor venue, the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena, to use for home games, and contracted with television and radio stations to broadcast games. The Giants debuted on December 4, 2010, defeating the San Francisco Rumble 182–124. They excelled on the court, going 23–0 in the regular season and advancing to the league playoffs, but were ultimately knocked out. They claimed an average attendance of 2000 in their inaugural season. 2011–2012 The Giants had their 2011–2012 opener on December 3, 2011, defeating the Gulf Coast Flash by 1 point on a buzzer beating 3-pointer by Shooting Guard Currye Todd on an inbound pass from former National Basketball Association player and 1992 US Dream Teamer Christian Laettner. Laettner joined the Giants for all 11 of their home games that season. The Giants played two home games at UNF Arena at the University of North Florida, and played the remaining nine at the Veterans Memorial Arena. The Giants won the 2012 ABA Championship, defeating the South Carolina Warriors 2–0 in a best-of-three series. 2012–2013 Giants finished the season with a 29–1 regular season record and hosted the ABA Final Four tournament. Giants won second ABA Championship in a row, defeating the North Dallas Vandals, who they received their only loss of the regular season from, 2–0 in a best-of-three series. 2013–2014 Giants finish season with 29–1 record for the second straight season and advanced through the playoffs to the ABA National Championship game for the third straight season. The Giants fell to the Shreveport-Bossier Mavericks 2–0 in a best-of-three series. The first game was lost in overtime and the second was lost on a botched inbound attempt that sealed the game for the Mavericks. The 2013–2014 season saw a lot of positives for the Giants as they broke the ABA Regular Season Attendance record with 8,345 fans in attendance on February 2nd. 2017-2018 Finishing the season with a 19-1 record the Giants head to the ABA Final Eight in Austin, TX. In Austin, TX the Jacksonville Giants go 3-0 defeating the Steel City Yellow Jackets (125-103), the DMV Warriors (111-102) and the Austin Bats (119-114) to claim the 2018 ABA National Championship title. With this title the Jacksonville Giants complete the three-peat making this their third championship in a row and their fifth overall championship for the city of Jacksonville. 2018–2019 The Jacksonville Giants finish the regular season with a 20-1 record and head to the ABA Final 8 in St. Louis, MO. The Giants take a 129-98 win over the Steel City Yellow Jackets in the first round of playoffs and advance to the semifinals. In the semifinals the Giants take on the Syracuse Stallions and are able to pull off a 149-129 win which advanced them to the 2019 ABA National Championship game. In the championship the Jacksonville Giants get a rematch with the South Florida Gold, the only team to defeat the Jacksonville Giants in the regular season. In the regular season the Gold took down the Giants with only a 5 point lead. In the title game the Jacksonville Giants were able to redeem themselves with a 116-112 win over the South Florida Gold to claim the 2019 title. The 2019 National Championship win makes it the 6th overall title for the Giants and the 4th in a row. 2019-2020 The 2019-2020 season marks the 10th Anniversary of the Jacksonville Giants conception.

The outcome of the battle of Guinea was probably decisive for Portugal reaching a very favourable sharing of the Atlantic and territories disputed with Castile in the Peace of Alcáçovas (1479). All with the exception of the Canary Islands stayed under Portuguese control: Guinea, Cape Verde, Madeira, Azores and the exclusive right of conquering the Kingdom of Fez. Portugal also won exclusive rights over the lands discovered or that were to be discovered south of the Canary Islands. John of Portugal (future King John II) Background In 1478, Prince John of Portugal, who had been charged since 1474 by his father, King Afonso V of Portugal, with the administration of the Portuguese maritime expansion, received news that a large Castilian fleet of thirty five ships commanded by Pedro de CovidesBlake, p.237 had been sent from Seville by Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon to Portugal's claimed Mina, in the region of the Gulf of Guinea, to attack the Portuguese there and trade with the natives. He immediately prepared and organized a fleet of eleven ships with the objective of intercepting the Castilian expedition, giving the command of the fleet to Jorge Correia and Mem Palha, two of his knights. Portuguese arrival and battle When the Portuguese fleet of eleven ships arrived at the Gulf of Guinea, the Castilians were already in the area for about two months trading with the Africans. Cheap goods like shells, old clothes, brass bracelets, and other items were being traded in exchange for gold, while slave raids along the coast of Guinea were also being conducted. 15th-century painting of King Afonso V of Portugal The Castilian fleet was anchored in a harbor near Mina when the Portuguese fleet initiated an attack early in the morning. The Castilians were caught by surprise and ended up being quickly and totally defeated, being forced to surrender to the Portuguese, who without much harm to themselves were able to capture the entire Castilian fleet along with its large cargo of gold. Aftermath The captured fleet was then taken to Lisbon. The large amount of gold captured by the Portuguese was enough to finance King Afonso's military campaign in Castile. At the end of the war, the Portuguese exchanged the Castilian prisoners of the captured fleet for the Portuguese prisoners captured in the Battle of Toro.Diffie, Shafer, Winius, \\"A happy result was that the prisoners of this Castilian fleet were exchanged by the Portuguese for those taken by the Castilians in the Battle of Toro.\\" p.151 In the following year, the Treaty of Alcáçovas was signed between Portugal and Castile, where King Afonso V of Portugal gave up his claim to the Castilian throne, recognizing the Catholic Monarchs as sovereigns of Castile and abandoning his claim to the Canary Islands, while Queen Isabella I of Castile recognized the Portuguese hegemony in the Atlantic Ocean, confirming Portuguese sovereignty over Madeira, Azores, the Cape Verde Islands and the: :\\"...lands discovered and to be discovered, found and to be found... and all the islands already discovered and to be discovered, and any other island which might be found and conquered from the Canary Islands beyond toward Guinea...\\"Diffie, Shafer, Winius, p.152 See also *History of Portugal *Portuguese Empire *House of Avis *Henry the Navigator *Age of Discovery *Treaty of Tordesillas *Elmina Castle NotesReferences *Bailey Wallys Diffie,Boyd C.

He just said a magic word and mountains rose up from the earth. Thủy Tinh also had the similar powers. When he waved his hand, the winds began to blow. When he spoke a magic word, the sea level elevated.The legend of Sơn Tinh and Thủy Tinh - Asia Finest Discussion Forum However, as both Sơn Tinh and Thủy Tinh met all the criteria required to become Mỵ Nương's husband, it was difficult to choose between them. Eventually, the King decided to present one final challenge. The first man to arrive with specially selected wedding gifts the next day would be granted permission to marry the princess. These unique wedding gifts included a nine-tusk elephant, a nine-spur cockerel, and a nine-mane horse. Early the next morning, as the sun came up, Sơn Tinh arrived first, married Mỵ Nương and took her back to the Tản Viên Mountain, where he lived. Thủy Tinh came a few minutes afterward. Upon realizing that he was too late, he became extremely furious. He and his servants chased after Sơn Tinh to take Mỵ Nuong back. Unwilling to accept defeat, he summoned torrential rain, gusty winds, thunder and lightning, and also brought the sea level higher, to defeat Sơn Tinh. However, as the sea level rose, Sơn Tinh used his magic to raise the height of the mountains as a counter-measure. Everyone suffered the rage of Thủy Tinh as the floods he caused destroyed land, crops, and houses. In an effort to protect the people, their properties and belongings, Son Tinh created dikes to shield from the rising sea. This battle between the two Lords lasted for countless days but eventually, Thủy Tinh became weary and lowered the sea level. He never, however, forgave Sơn Tinh nor let go of his desire for revenge to get Mỵ Nương back. Thus, every year, people have to suffer floods as a consequence of Thủy Tinh's eternal vindictiveness.

The corporate office was located in Denver, Colorado. The company primarily produced copper, gold, and molybdenum. Over its history, the Company evolved from being a major primary molybdenum producer to becoming a copper and gold mining company with the construction and development of the Mount Milligan (open-pit copper-gold) mine and concentrator in British Columbia, Canada. Mount Milligan was Thompson Creek Metals principal operation and the company owned 100% of this property. The company also owned 100% of its Thompson Creek Mine (open-pit molybdenum and concentrator) in Idaho. Thompson Creek Metals owned 75% joint venture interest in two other properties, including its Endako Mine (open-pit molybdenum, concentrator and roaster) in British Columbia, and its Langeloth Metallurgical Facility (roaster) in Pennsylvania. Thompson Creek Metals had additional development projects, including the Berg property in British Columbia (exploration of copper, molybdenum, and silver). In 2016, Thompson Creek was acquired by Centerra Gold for $1.1 billion. The deal took place because of Thompson Creek's substantial debt incurred to develop their Mount Milligan mine. History In 2006, the privately held Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA) was acquired by Canadian-based, publicly traded mining company Blue Pearl Mining Ltd for US$575 million, in addition to other payments worth as much as US$125 million depending on the price of molybdenum. The name Blue Pearl Mining Ltd was changed to Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. in May 2007. From October 2006 through August 2013, Thompson Creek Metals was solely a molybdenum producer. Pursuant to the acquisition of Terrane Metals Corp. in October 2010 for about US$700 million in a combination of cash and common stock, the company diversified its assets by adding significant reserves of copper and gold. Concurrent with the acquisition of Terrane, the Company entered into a Gold Stream Arrangement with Royal Gold Inc. as a financing mechanism for the purchase of Terrane. The Gold Stream Agreement was amended twice for a total payment by Royal Gold of approximately US$781 million for the right to purchase 52.25% of the gold from Mount Milligan Mine for US$435 per ounce for the life of the mine. Operating Mines Mount Milligan — Mount Milligan Mine (open-pit copper and gold mine) is located 90 miles northwest of Prince George in Central British Columbia, Canada. Mount Milligan Mine has a concentrator with a 60,000 tpd design capacity copper flotation processing plant. The estimated life of Mount Milligan Mine is approximately 24 years (which is based on spot metal prices copper and gold). Over the life of the mine, it is estimated that it will produce an average annual of 85 million pounds of copper and 186,700 ounces of gold in 155,000 tonnes of concentrate. In 2015 through 2019, the average annual production is projected to increase at approximately 94 million pounds of copper and 285,800 ounces of gold in 165,000 tonnes of concentrate. Thompson Creek Metals Company filed an updated NI 43-101 Technical Report for Mount Milligan Mine on January 21, 2015 that confirms these projections. In October 2010, through the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek Metals obtained the Mount Milligan development project and initiated construction soon after. On August 15, 2013, the initial feed to the concentrator started the operation of the mine. By September 2013, the mine had its first production, a copper-gold concentrate. Mount Milligan Mine reached commercial production as of February 18, 2014, which means that the mill operated at 60% planned capacity throughput for 30 days. Industrious activities were sustained through 2014 and are consistent today. The Company predicts that it will reach 60,000 tpd on a steady basis once it installs a secondary crushing circuit. Thompson Creek Metals expects to reach approximately 60,000 tpd by the end of 2015 by utilizing temporary crushing. Thompson Creek Mine (near Challis, Idaho) — The Thompson Creek Mine is a primary molybdenum mine located approximately 35 miles southwest of Challis in Idaho's Custer County, a historic mining area. Known as the Thompson Creek deposit, it was discovered in 1968 by Cyprus Minerals Corporation. The mine has been in operation since 1983 and uses conventional open-pit mining methods. The mine was sold in 1993 to Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA), which began mining at the site in April 1994. The company has claims on over 22,000 acres of land (includes waste dumps). It operates as an open pit mine, and includes Bruno Creek Tailings Impoundment, the second tallest center-line tailings dam in the world. The capacity of the mill to process is approximately 30,000 tons of ore per day to produce molybdenum sulfide concentrate. It is then roasted at the Company’s Langeloth Metallurgical Facility into molybdenum trioxide, ferromolybdenum products, and other specialty products. Due to low molybdenum prices, this mine is under maintenance and care currently. Endako Mine — 3 pit, open pit mine in central British Columbia (other 2 projects Berg and Davidson are west of it). Subsidiary Thompson Creek Holding owns 75% of the mine while Japanese company Sojitz Corporation has the other 25%. The operation also involves processing the molybdenum ore into a disulfide and then molybdenum trioxide through roasting. Expansion projects, which began in 2008 increased capacity by 77.4% (though expansions which include new mills will cut the mine life by 38.5% to 16 years). Langeloth Metallurgical Facility — The Langeloth Metallurgical Facility, located 25 miles west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a world-class facility with a long history of producing high-quality metallurgical products used mainly in the steel and chemical industries. The facility has roasting capacity of 35 million pounds of molybdenum per year. Four multiple-hearth furnaces are used for the conversion (roasting) of molybdenum disulfide concentrates into technical grade molybdenum oxide (tech oxide), which is sold in powder form or briquettes or converted into pure molybdenum oxide or ferromolybdenum. Two other furnaces process spent catalyst material containing other metals. Projects As part of the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek also acquired a copper, molybdenum and silver exploration property located in British Columbia, Canada (the Berg Property). Berg Property — Located about 50 miles southwest of Houston, BC and 15 miles northwest of Huckleberry Mine, this project is continuously assessed to determine if the deposit of copper, molybdenum, and silver is commercially ready for production. The Berg property is 100% owned by the company. Royal Gold has 1% net smelter return royalty held on eight of the mineral claims and one mining lease, including those which host the deposit on the Berg property. All mineral claims and the mining lease are in good standing and good to dates ranging from August 2015 to November 2021. Mineral claims are subject to exploration expenditure obligations, or they may choose to pay annual fees to the province in lieu of exploration expenditures. Thompson Creek expects to renew such mineral claims and mining lease in the ordinary course.

He was born Kleanthis Tsélébidis () into a Greek Orthodox family that had settled in Paris, having fled the massacre of the Greek population in Anatolia carried out by the Young Turks during the Greek-Turkish war. Lépidis spent his childhood and adolescence in the Parisian neighbourhood of Belleville. His father, like many Greek and Armenian refugees, worked in the shoe trade, which Clément too tried at one point as he later related in his books such as Ma vie en chantier, L'Arménien and La Main rouge. He tried several other careers, e.g., stockbroker's clerk, photographer, radio wireman, sales representative, cashier. His work experiences inspired the book The Tribulations of a Commercial Traveller. Afterwards, he devoted himself to paintinghttp://www.artnet.com/artist/703019/clement-lepidis.html and literature. Among his friends were the photographer Robert Doisneau, the accordionist Jo Privat whose biography he wrote, and the wrestler Tasso Miades. Lépidis loved his fellow Parisians. He described their happy and friendly character, but also wrote of the dark side of Paris during the German occupation when many Jews and Armenians, his friends and neighbours from Belleville were rounded up. These he depicted in the novel The Armenian. At his death in 1997, he left behind many works of literature, including poetry, short stories, and novels. His work was rooted in both the Mediterranean and his own Belleville neighbourhood.

It is the two artists' only collaborative work together and 9th Wonder's fifteenth collaborative album. The album's title derives from the artists' belief that contemporary black music was declining due to a perceived prioritization of style over substance, and the increasing popularity of music downloads, which they felt was reducing a new artist's chance of reaching the iconic status of previous artists. Originally conceived as a mixtape, Death of a Pop Star was recorded from 2009 to 2010 at Bright Lady Studios in Raleigh, North Carolina and Premier Studios in New York City. The hip hop production was mainly handled by 9th Wonder with assistance from David Banner, THX, Warryn Campbell and E. Jones on various tracks. The album includes guest appearances from rappers Ludacris and Big Remo; and singers Erykah Badu, Anthony Hamilton, Marsha Ambrosius, Heather Victoria and Lisa Ivey. The album was preceded by two official singles – \\"Slow Down\\", featuring Heather Victoria, and \\"Be With You\\", featuring Ludacris and Marsha Ambrosius. \\"Be With You\\" spent thirteen weeks on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at number 44. The song is Banner's first single to appear on this chart after more than two years. The album sold 7,300 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting and peaking at number 14 on the Top Independent Albums chart. A departure from Banner's past recordings, Death of a Pop Star received generally favorable reviews from music critics who deemed it the rapper's best work to date and gave praise to 9th Wonder's production. Background In July 2008, David Banner released the album The Greatest Story Ever Told, which reached number 3 on the US Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums and number 8 on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 51,800 copies. Three singles were released from the album: \\"Speaker\\" (also known by the title \\"9mm\\"), \\"Get Like Me\\" and \\"Shawty Say\\". \\"Get Like Me\\" reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album met with mixed reviews, which disappointed Banner who had expected it to be his defining body of work. Pondering what went wrong, Banner felt marginalized by the music industry's expectations, and therefore, wanted to enlist an elite producer to explore further creative and challenging avenues. \\"I wanted to feel different, I felt trapped in rap music,\\" Banner admitted. \\"I felt like I was dying musically.\\" With the intent of taking a different direction from songs like \\"Get Like Me\\" and \\"Play\\", Banner considered producers he wanted to work with, including 9th Wonder, Nottz, Just Blaze, DJ Khalil and Madlib. He settled with working with 9th Wonder, who runs a DJ business with a mutual friend. \\"David Banner and I have a mutual friend by the name of DJ Cuzzin B, who lives now in Washington D.C.,\\" 9th Wonder said. \\"David Banner came through D.C. and hooked up with [him] and was like, 'Yo, do you know 9th Wonder?' He was like, 'Yeah, that's my partner.' So Banner ended up coming to North Carolina. He was supposed to get a couple beats from me, but he ended up getting nine. That's how Death of a Pop Star came about.\\" Having produced his own music throughout his career, teaming up with 9th Wonder marks Banner's first time ceding control over production, sticking to microphone duties for the duration of an album. This decision was driven by his motivation to prove to hip hop listeners that they could place him among any lyricist they like. \\"I didn't want to produce any of this album. I wanted to prove to people that you could put me on the level of anybody that you like lyrically, and I think I proved that with this record,\\" Banner said. \\"And it's funny, I'm starting to hear people say that for the first time ever, people have started putting me up against some of the biggest lyricists now. I wanted to just focus on the pen on this album.\\" The pairing was surprising to many, as Banner's style is defined by his heavily pronounced Southern accent and 808-driven instrumentals, while Wonder is known for his signature style of using muffled percussion, chopping creaky soul samples and arranging these elements into boom bap. Borrowing a sound that originates in New York was a deliberate decision to help draw attention back to Banner's lyrical abilities. \\"As soon as I added 808s to my music, it seemed like people stopped listening, on top of the fact that I had a very heavy Southern drawl,\\" Banner said. \\"So I really concentrated on articulating my words this time, but not stomping on or suppressing my Southern accent.\\" Title  According to Banner, the title came from a discussion \\"about the death of contemporary music\\". The title was decided during a conversation between both artists about the troubled state of the music industry, with 9th holding the view that contemporary artists could not attain the same iconic heights as those of an earlier era. \\"We were just talking about the death of contemporary music,\\" Banner recounted. \\"How have we continued to let music go in the direction that it is? It's almost impossible for there to be another Michael Jackson or Usher or Chris Brown. And 9th said 'Damn! That's what we should call it. Death of a Pop Star.' \\" Although the title's significance can simply be interpreted as the death of being a pop star, the Mississippian insisted that it was chosen to spark a discussion among listeners about not only the album but also the death of contemporary black music. In regards to the demise of black music, 9th clarified that the presence of soul music, in particular, has diminished in mainstream media. \\"Not to say black music is dead all the way, but on the mainstream side there's not really much of a focus on soul. There's not a lot of people trying to redefine soul music. It's a situation that we wanted to address and put out in the mainstream arena.\\" Both artists felt that music in general has been depreciated by the emphasis on style to the detriment of substance. \\"9th Wonder is probably one of the most soulful [producers] in our generation,\\" told Banner. \\"Death of a Pop Star is needed for a balance in the music landscape right now, just like 2 Live Crew and A Tribe Called Quest were once needed at the same time.\\" Moreover, Banner observed that the increasing popularity of downloads has devalued music. \\"People just look at music as a download. But what they don't understand is when you get a Lil Wayne on your album, you have to pay for Wayne and […] get that money back. If you are not able to push units like a Michael [Jackson] or an Usher, how will you be able to possess the power to really move the masses of people? That's where the power comes in to renegotiate your recording contract; that's where you have the power to not only move things musically, but [also] socially.\\" Recording and production 9th Wonder was the main producer The recording sessions for Death of a Pop Star took place from 2009 to 2010 at Bright Lady Studios in Raleigh, North Carolina and Premier Studios in New York City. Primarily produced by 9th Wonder, the ten-track album was mixed by Neal Pogue and Pat Viala. David Banner provided additional production, along with Chris \\"THX\\" Goodman for Banner Beats, Warryn Campbell for The Machine, and E. Jones—a lead producer of 9th Wonder's production team, The Soul Council—who also produced \\"The Light\\", the sole track without input from Wonder. Live instrumentation is provided by Kevin Williams (flutes), Dontae Winslow (horns), E. Jones (keyboards), THX (keyboards), Warryn Campbell (bass, live drums, keyboards and piano), and David Banner as well (keyboards). The endeavor also includes additional vocals from Melodye Perry, Carlos Ricketts, and Joi Starr. Initially, the two artists intended to release their joint project as a free mixtape; however, as the sessions exceeded expectations, they changed their mind. 9th Wonder explained, \\"When we did the first three songs, we were like, 'Man, we ain't giving this jam away.' It was like, 'Man, this is really some good music.' Then about four or five [songs] in, we were like, 'Oh boy, we can't give this away.' \\" Subsequently, the pair decided to develop their project into a full-length album, recording more songs than the final ten. The live instrumentation on the album is a departure from 9th Wonder's usual sample-based production. Several tracks had to be replayed due to legal issues on using samples, which Banner regards have subdued the album's \\"true resonance.\\" Release Death of a Pop Star was originally scheduled to be released on December 29, 2009 as a free album. In October 2009, David Banner and 9th Wonder announced they would be setting up a website to accept donations toward the cost of producing the album, with half of the proceeds to be given to a non-profit organization. However, when both artists decided to turn the project into a full-length album, its release was delayed, first to summer 2010, then to November 7, 2010. Three days prior to the November release date a distribution deal with eOne Music was set up, and the album was rescheduled for release on December 21, 2010.  Promotion In April 2009, before an official announcement of the collaboration had been made public, 2DOPEBOYZ mentioned a track they called \\"“Channel 3” or “No Denyin'”\\", and provided a download link. On October 5, 2009, in the wake of the murder of Derrion Albert, the track \\"Something Is Wrong\\" was posted on the Okayplayer website with the comment that it: \\"touches on issues like the murder of Derrion Albert, Obama, and homosexuality\\". In October, Banner's Heal the Hood Foundation and 247HH.com partnered with MTV and enlisted the help of local celebrities and artists, along with MTV host Sway Calloway, to raise awareness of violence among urban youth throughout Chicago by organizing an Anti- Violence rally. The rally was used in the video shoot of the remix of \\"Something Is Wrong\\" which included performances from Naledge, Twista, Rhymefest and Skooda Chose. However, due to an increase in the anticipated number of attendees and resulting safety concerns, the event was postponed to mid-November. Following the release of the lead single, \\"Slow Down\\", the album closer, \\"Strange\\", was leaked online on March 11, 2010. The song features North Carolina-based rapper Big Remo, who at the time was signed under 9th Wonder's independent record label, Jamla. Shortly prior to the album's release, the duo unveiled two more tracks: \\"Mas 4\\" on December 2, 2010, and \\"Silly\\" on December 17, 2010. The latter track opens with 9th Wonder's lone rap performance on the album (under his rapping alter-ego 9thmatic), and features a chorus from Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Erykah Badu. On January 19, 2010, David Banner published on YouTube a teaser for the album. The teaser features a scrolling text explaining the album's context, with the album opener, \\"Diamonds on My Pinky\\", playing in the background. The text reads as follows: On June 26, 2010, Hot 97 radio personality Peter Rosenberg hosted a special event called An Evening With… to interview the two emcee- producers, take questions from the audience, and preview music from the album, similar in format to James Lipton's Inside the Actors Studio show. The event was open to the public and approximately fifty fans were granted entry on a first-come, first-served basis. OKPTV was also present to cover the event as well as get their own Q&A; session in which the two artists addressed their partnership and how it came about, among other topics. The event took place at 92YTribeca in New York City. Multimedia= Comic strip  webcomic strip The pair's intention was to make Death of a Pop Star a multimedia promotion; as part of that scheme, on 10 December 2010, they launched a webcomic strip on the website, deathofapopstar.com. \\"The idea with Death of a Pop Star was never for it to be only an album,\\" Banner explained. \\"The aim of this project was to engage the consumer on many different levels. With the music industry being in the state it's in, we as artists need to provide as much intriguing content as possible for our fans. This is the second step in exposing the Death of a Pop Star project on many different platforms.\\" According to 9th, \\"[c]omics, sneakers, and hip hop have always been close-knit with each other for years and years. This comic strip will show you exactly how close the relationships between those entities are.\\" The strip, bearing the same title as the album, centered around both men \\"living in the real world with superhuman powers\\". The press release announced that while \\"9th Wonder's character struggles with inner conflict, discipline and violence, David Banner's character must rise from an impoverished neighborhood, while following a higher calling.\\"  PlayStation 3 theme  Increasing the promotional efforts surrounding their album, the duo partnered with Konsole Kingz—an Atlanta-based company that combines hip hop with gaming—to design an album-inspired theme exclusively for PlayStation 3. The dynamic theme was made available at the PlayStation Store for free in January 2011. Upon downloading the package, gamers could personalize their console's general interface (XMB) with six backgrounds and custom sounds produced by Banner and 9th as well as the Konsole Kingz silver icon pack. \\"As technology evolves, so must the role of the artist in peoples lives. Death of a Pop Star was always designed to be bigger than just music,\\" said Banner. \\"With the help of the people at Konsole Kingz, we have been able to further expand the Death of a Pop Star experience.\\" Along the same vein, 9th Wonder shared that the purpose of the giveaway is to share their music with a wider audience. \\"We must understand that everyone discovers music differently. The radio is not the only place that you can decide to become a part of a musical experience. Gaming is a huge part of our culture, more than ever.\\" He continued, \\"Having a game introduce Death of a Pop Star to someone falls directly in line with our mission statement with this album; be different and revolutionary.\\" Singles The album's lead single, \\"Slow Down\\" featuring Jamla signee Heather Victoria, was leaked onto the Internet on January 21, 2010, and its music video premiered on June 21, 2010. Illusive Media and David Banner directed the video with a theme loosely based on John Carpenter's 1988 cult classic, They Live, which starred Roddy Piper and Keith David. On November 19, 2010, the album's version of the song was made purchasable. The album's rendition differs from the original leaked version, produced solely by 9th Wonder. The original contains a sample of \\"On Impact\\" as performed by The Whispers. Due to sample clearance issues, 9th, Banner and Warryn Campbell reproduced the song, and the sample's vocals were resung by Melodye Perry. The second single, \\"Be With You\\", featuring rapper Ludacris and singer Marsha Ambrosius, was released on November 3, 2010 and made purchasable twenty days later. The song spent thirteen weeks on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, on which it peaked at number 44. The song is David Banner's first single to appear on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart after more than two years. The music video, directed by Mr. Boomtown, premiered on December 16, 2010 on MTV. On January 2, 2014, it was reported by TMZ that David Banner, Ludacris and Marsha Ambrosius received a copyright infringement lawsuit over allegedly using a sample of late soul singer Tyrone Davis' 1979 ballad, \\"Be With Me\\", without consent. Banner was sued by the song's producer and publishing company, who claim that the rapper-producer illegally sampled Davis' tune on \\"Be With You\\". Ludacris and Marsha are mentioned in the lawsuit due to their appearance on the song. Although unconfirmed by TMZ, 9th Wonder and co-producer Warryn Campbell are likely to have been implicated in the case as well. Reception Death of a Pop Star debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Top Rap Albums chart, selling 7,300 copies in its first week of release. It entered at number 41 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, as well as the Top Independent Albums chart at number 14. Death of a Pop Star opened up to generally favorable reviews from critics. Justin Hunte, former editor-in-chief of HipHopDX, hailed Death of a Pop Star as David Banner's best and \\"most digestible\\" work to date and 9th Wonder's \\"most complete pet project\\" since his 2006 Murray's Revenge collaboration with rapper Murs. He further commented that the brevity of the album \\"is balanced by a high quality collection of songs screaming replay value throughout\\". USA Today critic Steve Jones considered that 9th Wonder's soulful production provided a \\"compelling backdrop for Banner's pointed lyrics\\", and felt that the guest artists supplied \\"potent contributions\\". Emanuel Wallace of RapReviews found that the production \\"works exceptionally well with Banner's oftentimes aggressive flow\\", but continued that his \\"biggest gripe would have to be the brevity of the album\\". Jermaine Dobbins, writing for SoulCulture, observed that \\"[t]hose who remember the rapper's more explicit work such as 'Like a Pimp' or 'Play' would be forgiven for not [recognizing] this as the same man. The raspy Southern drawl has been replaced by a clearer and enunciated voice that Banner effectively uses to teach, admonish and entertain with equal aplomb.\\" In spite of the seemingly odd pairing of the two artists, David Jeffries, reviewing for AllMusic, heard \\"a great chemistry\\" between them. He felt that 9th Wonder's soulful production was \\"top-notch,\\" though Banner was \\"the real attraction\\" for presenting himself as \\"a more layered and complicated artist\\" than showcased on previous works. Yet, he noted that \\"while [the album is] sold as a conceptual piece inspired by the end of music industry, it does go off topic without warning.\\"Jeffries, David [ Death of a Pop Star - David Banner, 9th Wonder]. AllMusic. Retrieved on 25 Dec 2010. In a mixed review for Pitchfork, Jess Harvell panned the lyrics, labeling them \\"a mess\\", and criticized the album for being \\"heavy on drippy love raps\\", and for having \\"dumbly repetitive hooks\\" and \\"beats suspiciously lacking in thump-value\\". Furthermore, he opined that \\"[t]here are moments throughout Death of a Pop Star that suggest the better album that might have resulted with a little more focus and intensity\\", and deemed Banner \\"too odd and talented, too much his own man, to wind up an also-ran in hip-hop history\\". According to Wilson McBee of Prefix Magazine, the album's weaknesses are \\"partially due to sequencing\\"; explaining that, \\"The record starts with blistering battle-rhyming, retreats into tepid alt- rap, and finishes with melancholy social critique.\\" In addition, McBee thought both artists could perhaps have \\"improved the album by weaving these thematic threads rather than separating them.\\" Track listing (*) designates additional production ;Notes *\\"Diamonds on My Pinky\\" features additional vocals from Carlos Ricketts, and keys by David Banner and THX. *\\"No Denying (Channel 3)\\" features additional vocals from Melodye Perry, bass and piano by Warryn Campbell. *\\"Slow Down\\" features additional vocals from Melodye Perry. *\\"Be With You\\" features keys by Warryn Campbell and E.

The abbreviation \\"КЛУБ\\" stands for , Integrated Train Protection System.  Variants  The most common variant is KLUB-U where the U stands for unified (). KLUB-U in-cab signalling systems are able to decode the track- side ALSN codes (Continuous Automatic Train Signallisation) which is similar to RS4 Codici (comparable to Pulse Code Cab Signaling in the US). In the newer ABTC-M block control the KLUB-U systems decode signals by TETRA digital radio including a remote initiation of a train stop. In those areas the train position is derived from a satellite navigation system (GPS or GLONASS). The ITARUS-ATC connects the KLUB-U in-cab system via GSM-R digital radio with the ERMTS Level 2 RBC block control. The KLUB-U systems are capable for high-speed tracks like that of the Velaro RUS (Sapsan). The variant KLUB-P (КЛУБ-П) is restricted to cab signaling without track safety equipment. It is only used in category-II trains (including special cars and shunting movements). The variant KLUB-UP (КЛУБ-УП) is allowed for category-I trains (including passenger transport) where it replaces the cab signaling of ALSN.  Development  The history of KLUB devices goes back to the year 1988 when it was considered to create a new microprocessor-controlled cab signaling that would allow advanced features. In the early 1990s a number of proposals were tested until in October 1994 the first KLUB device was certified for operation - in the following years there were 1214 locomotives being equipped with this version. This first KLUB version can be easily identified by its LED display (later KLUB devices use LCD displays). In 1997 the manufacturer VNIIAS proposed a concept on the development of a new trail control system which the ministry approved. The concept KURS-B (КУРС-Б - - integrated system for train control and train safety) would consist of three main parts: the KLUB-U cab signaling, the SAUT brake control (САУТ - ) and the TS-KBM vigilance control (ТС КБМ - ).http://www.eav.ru/publ1.php?publid=2004-11a24 KLUB-UP variant in an AS1A locomotive:ru:АС1А The development of KURS-B began in 1998. To increase the safety, all modules function separately. The system was designed to be open so that more modules can be integrated later - all modules communicate via CAN bus. All sub-modules are in duplicate in the system. In 1999 the KLUB-U was certified and went into production; the variants KLUB-UP and KLUB-P were derived since 1999 and they are in production since 2000. The computerized KLUB-U cab signaling contains allows the integration of an electronic map and the usage of GLONASS (rarely GPS) satellite-based location. In 2007, 12% of all KLUB-U control units were equipped with a GIS option while 100% of the KLUB-UP control units were delivered with satellite navigation.http://www.eav.ru/publ1.php?publid=2007-11a20 A PC interface allows to download recorded process data to support maintenance and to upload updated electronic route maps. The tapped data is aggregated in a service center - the service center also publishes the updates of the track maps. An important extension is the integration of digital radio in the KLUB-U system. The reason is that the ALSN signals could not be detected safely at high speeds. A \\"MOST\\" bridge interface (Мост - Bridge) will feed the signals in the simplest case by decoding a radio repeater transmitting at 160 MHz or 460 MHz. It is also possible to integrate the signaling of GSM-R or TETRA radio. In the first phase that is mainly used in the station area where the dispatcher can issue both track-releases (as in the case of a failure of stationary signals) but he can also remotely trigger an emergency stop - this feature was introduced in 2004 at the request of the ministry. The growing number of safety modules did increase the number of warning signals as well as the number of automatic brake incidents. A subsequent analysis lead to a refined specification which was pushed to the cab computers with an update in late 2006. The number of failures dropped from 164 in 2006 to 80 in 2007.http://www.eav.ru/publ1.php?publid=2008-08a28 In 2004 another development started as well targeting a new electronic interlocking device communicating via digital radio with the train sets. This ABTC-M block control system (АБТЦ-М - - Autoblock System with Central Control) was introduced in 2006.http://www.eav.ru/publ1.php?publid=2006-12a10 In 2010 the Russian Railways had equipped almost 12,000 vehicles with satellite navigation being about 36 percent of the rolling stock that runs with KLUB-U or KLUB- UP.http://eav.ru/publ1p.php?publid=2010-05a01 Estimates for the time frame up to 2015 indicate a requirement of satellite-navigation train equipment to be installed in the range of 28,000 to 30,000 devices - additionally there will be a requirement of 50,000 hand-held devices for location and communication of railway workers.http://www.eav.ru/publ1p.php?publid=2008-07a03 The devices to connect control center, railway workers and train staff are using the TETRA mobile communication standard.  ITARUS-ATC  KLUB-U is at the center of an expanded concept EKS (ЕКС - - Single Unified Train Control System). This will be able to decode signals from Eurobalises and display the information in an extended version that allows representation of signals according to European railway standards. For cross-border transport to Finland a cooperation with Ansaldo STS was created in 2007 which developed the Italian- Russian train control system ITARUS-ATC ((ITAlian-RUSsian - Automatic Train Control) being compatible with ETCS.http://www.eav.ru/publ1p.php?publid=2009-01a16 It is similar to ERTMS Level-2 (being able to use GSM-R to communicate with its Radio Block Center) but adds satellite navigation to the system.http://www.eav.ru/publ1.php?publid=2009-07a07 The system combines inertial navigation and wheel sensors to measure distance and turns to enhance safety for passenger service in the Russian Federation.http://www.eav.ru/publ1.php?publid=2009-08a28 Ansaldo was contracted in January 2010 to deploy the ITARUS-ATC on the test track for a later rail connection to Sochi up to the 2014 winter games.http://www.transportweekly.com/pages/en/news/articles/68352/ 13.

After his conversion to Catholicism and consequent exile, he placed his vast knowledge of Slavic culture at the service of a better understanding between the Russian Orthodox and Catholic Churches.  Biography  After brilliant university studies at Saint-Petersburg (where he obtained the ‘gold medal’) Martinov undertakes a long journey across Europe. In France he meets among others Father Xavier de Ravignan. His conversations with Ravignan led him to join the Catholic Church came from Russian Orthodoxy, and following the example of his friend Ivan Gagarin, in requesting admission in the Society of Jesus (18 September 1845). The Jesuit curriculum of studies led him to Brugelette (Belgium) for the study of Philosophy (1847-1848) and Laval (France) for Theology (1848-1852). He is ordained priest the 20 September 1851. He did some further studies in Patrology at Paris (1852-1853) and the Jesuit last year of formation, called ‘Tertianship’ (1853-1854). In 1854, together with other Russian Jesuit Ivan Gagarin and Dzhunkovsky, Martinov is convicted in absentia by the Russian authorities for unauthorized stay abroad and for joining the monks of the Jesuit order. This deprived him of all class and property rights, and effectively prevented his returning home. Appointed at the ‘Saints Cyril and Methodius Society’, he worked in collaboration with Ivan Gagarin, Eugene Balabin, and others in making the Russian and Slavic religious and historical heritage better known in Western Europe. Living in France, he was engaged in religious journalism and archaeology (mostly Russian), writing extensively in French journals, and keeping people abreast of Russian scientific and literary life under the title «Courrier russe». Residing at times in Paris, at times in Versailles, Martinov was all through his life a ‘writer’ and journalist at the service of the 'Saints Cyril and Methodius’ apostolate. In particular he founded in 1866 the ‘Slavic Library’ which in the course of times became one of the richest in Western Europe. In 1870 Martinov was in Rome for the Vatican I Council as theologian and expert invited by Pius IX. In 1883 he was appointed by Leo XIII consultant of the 'Propaganda Fide' Congregation, for Oriental affairs. Ivan Martinov died in Cannes (France) on 26 April 1894.

Early life Halliwell attended Huddersfield College of Art (1953–59) as an art student, but was expelled for a time from the institution, and later switched to acting at RADA. It was there that Halliwell first met Mike Leigh. According to Leigh, the other students \\"were mostly posh kids and it was terribly old- fashioned and twee, not like it is now, but there was a scruff element. John Hurt was there, David Warner was there. Me, Halliwell, Ken Campbell and a few other renegades.\\" In the early 1960s he worked as an actor in rep and was a stage manager at the Nottingham Playhouse for a time.Obituary: David Halliwell, The Times, 21 March 2006 Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs His experiences at the Huddersfield College were the basis for his earliest produced and best remembered play, Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs. In this play Malcolm Scrawdyke, a Hitlerite figure, plots revenge against authority for his college expulsion by forming the Party of Dynamic Erection with his three acolytes. \\"The Nazis made a big impression on people of my age\\", Halliwell recalled. \\"They almost destroyed Europe. But as well as being pretty threatening they were also seen as a laughing stock even during the war.\\" The play won Halliwell the Evening Standard's Most Promising Playwright Award in 1967.Patrick Newley Obituary: David Halliwell\\", The Stage, 12 April 2006 Malcolm's premier production at the Unity Theatre in 1965 was directed by Mike Leigh with Halliwell himself in the central role of Malcolm.Michael Billington & Mike Leigh Obituary: David Halliwell, The Guardian, 22 March 2006 Lasting six hours in this version, the production's run was short. Taken up by West End producer Michael Codron, reduced to a more manageable length, John Hurt now featured as the character in a West End production and on Broadway (both were short runs) where the play was retitled Hail Scrawdyke! A feature film version followed, Little Malcolm (1974), again with Hurt in the lead. A successful revival in 1999 starred Ewan McGregor.\\"McGregor play opens in West End\\", BBC News, 22 January 1999 Later work In 1968 Halliwell jointly set up a company named Quipu (an Inca communication tool) which performed at various London theatres until 1973. Its stated aim reflected the radical politics of the time: \\"a new kind of organisation in which the means of production are owned, controlled and developed by the artists whose work is being produced\\". Quipu, \\"the first lunchtime theatre club in London\\",John Elsom Post-war British Theatre, London: Routledtge, 1976, p.158 allowed the tryout of short plays. It was a form of \\"devised theatre\\" which Mike Leigh, recalling Halliwell in 2015, thought his friend's personality was incompatible: \\"His relationship with the actors wasn’t about growing and enabling, but about dictating, so the plays were always somewhat inorganic. The writer was there, though. He had great ideas – perceptive to the highest degree and witty, too.\\" Halliwell's later stage plays include Who's Who of Flapland (1967) and K.D. Dufford (1969).Dan Rebellato \\"Halliwell, David [William]\\", in Colin Chambers The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre, London: Continuum, 2002 [2005], p.338 Halliwell researched the professional relationship of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, both involved in the discovery of DNA, in the 1980s,DNA King's College, London but his work was not completed, although the recordings of people he interviewed have been preserved. He contributed several television scripts to several of the BBC's anthology series, including Play for Today, and wrote (an unproduced serial) for Doctor Who.

It is located North of the Rudee Inlet Bridge and includes the boardwalk itself, Atlantic Avenue, and Pacific Avenue. Virginia Beach is a resort city, and the Oceanfront is a main tourist attraction. The current version of the boardwalk was first constructed in 1988. It is made of concrete; the boardwalk links over forty hotels and other attractions and has a bike path. History With the construction of the rail system in 1883 tourism in Virginia Beach began to grow. Soon after the Virginia Beach Hotel was opened, offering tourists the first overnight accommodations.http://www.visitvirginiabeach.com/pressroom/mediakits/VB2011/pdfs/2011HistoricalBackgrounder.pdf As more tourists began to spend their summers in Virginia Beach along the coast, construction began on the boardwalk in 1888. It was first built from wooden planks and expanded a mere five blocks.https://www.virginiabeach.com/articles/virginia-beach-boardwalk- history-cavalier-hotel During the gilded age the boardwalk was home to the famous Peacock Ballroom, where performances were held by such artists as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and Tommy Dorsey. By the early 1900s, Virginia Beach became a well-known vacation destination. In 1927, The Cavalier opened its doors. This was Virginia Beach’s first grand hotel. The Cavalier was host to 7 US Presidents: Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. The hotel was also an attraction to national celebrities such as, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Bette Davis, Jean Harlow, Judy Garland, Will Rogers and Fatty Arbuckle. During the 1930s through the 1950s the Cavalier hosted the most popular big bands in the world. Some of these performances included: Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Xavier Cugat, Cab Calloway and Lawrence Welk. The Cavalier even contributed to World War II. In 1942, the United States Navy asked for the hotel’s help. They converted the stables into sailor’s living quarters, drained the pool for training purposes and even had the hotel chefs feeding the Navy trainees. In 1973 in response to the growing number tourists visiting the area The Cavalier built an 11-story oceanfront hotel. In the following years the hotel was visited by Presidents Gerald Ford, George Bush, and then Ambassador to China, to address the Virginia Bar Association; and President Jimmy Carter to speak before the Southern Baptist Convention. Features The oceanfront features many monuments to Virginians who have impacted the history of the state. Some of the monuments are located at the Naval Aviation Monument Park which was formally dedicated on May 6, 2006, by the Hampton Roads Squadron of the Naval Aviation Foundation Association. Planned since 1997 in partnership with the City of Virginia Beach, the park features heroic-scale statuary and reliefs to tell the history of Naval Aviation. The Virginia Legends Walk features famous historical Virginians such as Pocahontas, Edgar Allan Poe and George Washington. Many other monuments are scattered between hotels. A main monument is the statue of King Neptune - a colossal 34-foot-high bronze statue that rises from the sand at 31st Street & Atlantic Avenue, overlooking Neptune Park. Other attractions include various forms of artwork between hotels and other buildings. Many are sculptures including different starfish, dolphins, and sea turtles painted in many colors for people's viewing pleasure. Entertainment The Virginia Beach Oceanfront is home to Beach Street USA which lines up entertainment events during the summer months for tourists. Most events are free and include local and visiting performers from magic shows and musical talents, to psychics and palm readers. Some events do cost money, though. One of the most well known events at the ocean front hosted by Beach Street USA is McDonald's Holiday Lights at the Beach where guests can sit in their car and drive along the boardwalk to view many different holiday light setups. There are bikes for individuals and families for rent all summer which are accommodated on a bike path that stretches the entirety of the boardwalk. There are over forty hotels which are interspersed between small restaurants, photo studios, and other random shops. Night clubs are also in abundance on both Atlantic and Pacific Avenue.

Over time, oysters have been negatively affected by environmental change, such as harmful fishing techniques, over harvesting, water pollution, and other factors. The results of these factors have been disease and ultimately, a large decline in the global population of oysters and the prevalence and sustainability of oyster reefs. Apart from the ecological importance of oyster reefs, oyster farming is an important industry, particularly in coastal areas. Both artificial materials and natural components have been used to rebuild the reefs in an attempt to regenerate the oyster population thus fostering the reformation of reefs.  Ecosystem and history  The first stage in an oyster’s life cycle is the free-swimming larval stage. After about three weeks, the larva attaches to a hard substrate—surface area to attach to—such as prop roots, dock pilings, natural rock, and other oysters becoming an oyster spat—oysters that have just settled to the bottom. A large number of oysters often join together, thus forming an oyster reef (also referred to as oyster bed, oyster mat). Once attached to a surface, oysters will stay there for the remainder of their lives. Oyster beds provide a number of ecological, economical and recreational benefits to the environment. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, the Eastern Oyster acts as a keystone species by filtering estuaries and maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems. In addition to being a keystone species, oysters also serve as an indicator species—they are used to gather information on the overall health of the ecosystem. Since the early Americas, oyster beds have been beneficial for the North American Indians, who harvested oysters for subsistence purposes, and for the European colonists in the region. Since the 19th century oyster beds have been vital for commercial harvests and have generated substantial income. However, the majority of oyster populations have greatly declined within the last century due to over- harvesting, dredging, increased sedimentation, invasive species, pollution and disease. It is estimated that more than 85% of oyster reefs are gone, making it the most threatened marine habitat in the world. As a result, this has spawned a need for oyster restoration projects in order to revitalize the depleted natural resource of the oyster population. In response to this decline, many oyster restoration projects have been put into place throughout the southeastern United States. The projects develop a long-term strategy of sustained productivity for oyster reefs and restore the ecological role they provide to nearby reef habitats.  Techniques  The first step in oyster restoration is to determine the locations for potential reefs. This is often done by comprehensive surveys that measure salinity levels, water quality, previous existence of oyster reefs, substrate conditions, prevalence of diseases, tidal range, oxygen concentration, algae concentration, prevalence of predators, accessibility and security. Once the location is determined, cultch—fossilized shell, coral or other similar materials produced by living organisms designed to provide points of attachment for oysters—is often obtained from sustainable recycling programs. Used oyster and clam shells from farmers and restaurants are collected and disinfected by volunteers to be used in oyster restoration. Once returned to the water, these recycled shells provide substrate for oyster larval eggs to begin populating oyster beds laid out by volunteers programs such as those implemented in Southwest Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia Southern California, and Alabama. A common species of oysters used in oyster restoration is the Eastern American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), which is also called the American Oyster, Atlantic Oyster, Common Oyster, and Virginia Oyster. According to the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center (SRAC), oysters in the southern part of the United States spawn when water temperatures are above 68 degrees. But they are affected more by the specific site where oyster restoration projects occur, the species of oysters used in a project, and if they are native to the surrounding area and disease free. Commonly in the southeastern U.S., mangroves and other shoreline vegetation are often planted in conjunction with oyster restoration efforts to provide substrate – surface area to attach to – and reduce shoreline erosion resulting in less sediment deposits within estuaries. Oyster restoration in public waters often requires permits and licenses from various agencies with requirements varying from state to state. Most often permits typically involve the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, state natural resource agencies and state public health departments.  Goals  The typical desired outcomes of these restoration projects are the restoration of oyster reefs to produce a fully functioning, three-dimensional bed system that provides associated ecosystem services and biological functions, such as marine biodiversity, shoreline protection, sediment trapping, water quality improvement, and recreational fishing opportunities. NOAA provides some of the major goals of an oyster restoration project: * Augment commercial harvest * Serve as habitat * Improve water quality * Increase or improve spat set in an area by creating oyster sanctuaries * Maintain or increase biodiversity * Restore ecological function * Provide a barrier to prevent beach or shoreline erosion * Protect and enhance sea grass restoration projects  Environmental value  Intertidal oysters act as a keystone species by maintaining a healthy coastal ecosystem. They filter the water and increase water clarity by extracting organic and inorganic particles. The filtration capacity of an average adult oyster is estimated to be 50 gallons per day. Oysters not only clean the water, but also act as effective shoreline buffers by dissipating the energy caused by boat wakes and waves. Oyster reefs also support critical fisheries by providing habitat for numerous species of fish, crustaceans and shellfish. The ecological value of reusing oyster shells for oyster restoration projects is vital not only for producing zero waste, but also for diversifying and increasing the number of oyster beds in a given area. In addition to environmental benefits, oyster restoration is also economically beneficial since coastal communities rely heavily on oysters for profit and subsistence.  Environmental preventative issues  Some ancient reefs are used to make restorative oyster reefs in nearby sites. However, to reduce the risk of environmental damage when dredging, many projects tend to stay away from this method of transplanting. Another issue of environmental harm is placing invasive or newly introduced oyster species in an unknown habitat that can cause more harm than good. Therefore, it is important to correctly place oyster species in their respective habitats to prevent environmental harm to nearby oyster reefs. More information is available in local extension agencies within the state you live in.  Economic value  Oyster reefs provide essential habitats for many ecological and economically important fish as well as invertebrate species. Healthy oyster populations improve the quality of water, which in turn improves commercial and recreational fishing, recreational boating, and ecotourism. Not only does oyster restoration create additional jobs through the duration of projects, but it also safeguards many other jobs ranging from marine construction to scientific research jobs. Dr. Paul Zimba, Director of the Center for Coastal Studies at Texas A&M-Corpus; Christi said, \\"Oysters are an important ecological and economic resource. They create habitats for fish and shellfish, filter and clean bay waters, protect shorelines from erosion, and are a valued commercial fishery element.\\" Aquaculture The research in aquaculture has been a major contributor to the development of viable oyster strains to assist the commercial aquaculture industry and local ecosystems. The industry of aquaculture is booming with global profits exceeding $3,000,000,000 annually. Oyster restoration projects assist in the production of aquaculture harvests and have different procedural measures for different areas of the United States. Aquaculture techniques vary geographically and represent regional differences. Some areas of the U.S. have enacted policies to lease out areas for aquaculture businesses to utilize the oyster-restored beds. These leasing policies will prove beneficial to job creation in coastal areas, improve the surrounding economy, and restore habitats where oyster restoration projects and commercial businesses occur. All in all, aquaculture has and will continue to gain recognition for providing sustainable harvesting methods.  Social value  Oyster restoration has many recreational benefits. Improved water clarity and overall cleaner water greatly increases recreational fishing, boating and swimming. This allows locals and tourists to appreciate the environment around them. In many parts of the southeastern United States volunteer efforts are responsible for oyster restoration. Community-based oyster restoration programs allow people to become knowledgeable on the important benefits oysters provide to an ecosystem. This volunteerism connects individuals with their environment as well as ensures the existence of oyster populations for future generations to appreciate. Areas of the southeastern United States, such as the coastal areas in the Gulf of Mexico, have a rich tradition related to oysters and other marine food that coastal areas provide. Oysters are part of the social culture in these areas and oyster restoration is a step towards preserving their traditions. In addition to volunteering with oyster restoration projects, individuals with shoreline property—or those who have access to it—have the option of backyard shellfish gardening. This sustainable form of oyster harvesting allows for personal consumption or environmental enhancement and usually does not require special licenses or permits.  Specific examples in the southeastern United States = Florida  The Oyster Reef Restoration began in June 2009 and is expected to be completed by the fall of 2010. The project is funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The goal of the project is to restore the important oyster habitat in the St. Lucie and Loxahatchee Estuaries, two of the largest brackish water systems on the east coast of Florida, where over the last 50 years oyster populations have declined by as much as 75%.  South Carolina  South Carolina Oyster Restoration and Enhancement (SCORE) is another volunteer oyster restoration movement. SCORE operates under the direction of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) and began in May 2001. The sites span approximately of the South Carolina coastline and have constructed 188 oyster reefs at 35 sites since the program began.  North Carolina  The Eastern Oyster populations of the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River basins have plunged 97% to 3% of historic numbers throughout the last century. In response to this drastic change, the Citizens’ Oyster Gardening Project (COGP) began. COGP is an environmental demonstration project that encourages oyster gardening aimed to reestablish populations of native Eastern Oysters in North Carolina through education and aquaculture methods. Educational workshops teach volunteers how to measure water quality and give information on oyster gardening techniques as well as necessary tools and materials. Advocacy through networking by volunteers is key to COGP’s success.  Specific examples in Eastern United States = New York  As of September 2016, the Environmental Protection Department of New York City has added nearly 50,000 adult oysters to Jamaica Bay. The funding comes from a grant of $1 million given by the United States Interior Department's Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program. By inducing a self-sustaining oyster population into Jamaica Bay, potential benefits include: \\"improving water quality, protecting the shoreline from erosion and reviving habitats for fish and wildlife\\". Pete Malinowski is a founder and director of the Billion Oyster Project who hopes to rejuvenate 1 billion oysters into the New York City waters and says, “It used to be known for its oysters. At one time, half of the world’s oysters were harvested in the New York Harbor.” The goal seems ambitious but pales to the number of oysters that populated the waters in colonial times: 3 trillion oysters, and 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 annual spawn of oyster larvae. In September 2016, 85 cages with five gallons of oysters each were tied to a 400 pound anchor and pulled into the harbor to be dropped. For 2 years the department will assess the surrounding water quality and monitor oyster beds.

His brother Edwin was with The Philadelphia Inquirer, and his father was the city editor and a political and editorial writer with the Philadelphia Public Ledger. The young Hoban attended parochial schools and Saint Joseph's College, but he dropped out in 1907 to take a job at Philadelphia's North American newspaper, as he recalled, \\"There I made borders for pictures of the 'murdered man' et al.

Later that year, he was given only a weekend to devise a comic strip, and he created Jerry on the Job, about pint-size Jerry Flannigan, initially employed as an office boy and then in a variety of other jobs. The strip was launched on December 29, 1913. Comics historian Don Markstein described Hoban's character and work situations: :Jerry was about the size of a five-year-old who was small for his age, and proportioned like an infant (larger head as compared with the rest of his body) only more so—Jerry was only two heads tall; i.e., the remainder of him, all put together, was about as big as his head... After a year or two, he began moving from job to job. He was a retail clerk, a messenger boy, even a prize fighter (at his size!) and other things before Hoban went off to fight World War I, and the strip went on hiatus. When it returned, Jerry was working at a railroad station under the supervision of Mr. Givney, the station's manager. His job included just about everything that went into making a railroad station function—selling tickets, sweeping floors, toting baggage, running little errands for the boss, etc. Sources of humor included the eccentrics who hung around the station, Mr. Givney's peevishness, and Jerry's own ineptitude. Also, Hoban pioneered in the use of humorous signs posted here and there in the background, a motif also seen in Smokey Stover, Mad and elsewhere. And practically everyone commenting on the strip has praised Hoban for putting his characters through spectacular \\"takes\\", that is, exaggerated physical responses to surprising or disconcerting events. He specialized in what some call the \\"flip take\\", which left the character undergoing it (usually Givney) as flat on the ground as Charlie Brown after trying to kick Lucy's football.Markstein, Don. Toonopedia. During World War I, Hoban was a sergeant in the military police. In 1918, he attended the divisional training school for officers at Camp Meade in Maryland.\\"Athletics for Meade\\". Washington Post, January 7, 1918. In 1922, Hoban provided illustrative slides to accompany songs in the Greenwich Village Follies revue. He was a member of the Pen and Pencil Club of Philadelphia and took part in their annual Nights in Bohemia roof garden show.Fourth Estate, May 20, 1922. The Jerry on the Job Sunday page began in 1919, but it later became a topper strip above another Hoban feature, Rainbow Duffy. The daily strip came to an end in 1931, and the topper was dropped in 1932. During the late 1930s, Hoban's character was used to advertise Post Grape-Nut Flakes. After Hoban's death in 1939, his former assistant, Bob Naylor, revived Jerry on the Job as a syndicated strip for King Features, starting on Oct. 21, 1946. However, Naylor's revival was not as successful as Hoban's original strip, and the strip was canceled in 1949. In the 1930s, Hoban started two other strips, Needlenose Noonan and Discontinued Stories, but neither was as successful as Jerry on the Job. On September 15, 1931, Hoban appeared with 14 other leading newspaper cartoonists on an NBC radio program, Cartoonists Convention, hosted by Arthur \\"Bugs\\" Baer. The promotional aspect of this was revealed in radio listings where it was labeled \\"NBC Hearst Program\\". The show featured an orchestra, and each cartoonist spoke for 90 seconds.

See Old Style and New Style dates between Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox and the Scottish Regent James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, and their adherents, during the minority of Mary, Queen of Scots. There was a second battle at Glasgow Muir in May 1544 between Arran and the Earl of Glencairn.Also known as Battle of Glasgow Field, and the Battle of Glasgow Muir (or Battle of Glasgow Moor). Prelude The Earl of Lennox and William Cunningham, Earl of Glencairn continued to show support for the marriage of Prince Edward to Mary, Queen of Scots after the Parliament of Scotland had rejected this English marriage proposal. The rejection, a breach of the Treaty of Greenwich, resulted in the declaration of war, the war now called the Rough Wooing.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2000), 134-142. Lennox and Glencairn were thus caught offside and technically traitors. Lennox wrote to Mary of Guise on 7 March 1544 hoping to buy time by offering his innocence to be tried before a convention of his peers. He wrote that it was heavily murmured by the Governor and his council; > \\"that I am the principell man that causis division and braik be in this > realme and makis daily insurrectionis and disobeance contrar the authority.\\" However Arran had already ordered an attack on Glasgow.Cameron, Annie I., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, STS (1927), 67.

Bothwell Castle was taken first on 8 March.Letters and Papers Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1, (1903), no. 181. Lennox's men took up position at the Castle and Cathedral, but he himself stayed at his stronghold, Dumbarton Castle. Battle Hamilton's forces encountered Lennox's followers at Glasgow Muir (Moor), a mile east of the town. The battle started well for Lennox, his force of about 800 men drove the first rank of the more numerous forces of Hamilton back into the second rank and captured their cannon. At this juncture, Robert Boyd of Kilmarnock and his friend Mungo Mure of Rowallan, valiantly thrust themselves \\"into the midst of the combat\\", which resulted favourably for the Regent Hamilton at the end of the battle. There were about 300 slain on both sides. Lennox himself withdrew to Dumbarton Castle, his stronghold. According to an English messenger, Edward Storye, it was reported that Hamilton then took the town of Glasgow and laid siege to Bishop's Castle on Wednesday 26 March.Letters and Papers Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1 (1903), no. 299 (3) & footnote. Amongst the casualties at the moor was Hamilton's Master of Household, and a Glasgow barber-surgeon was hired to look after the injured. The gunner, Hans Cochrane, directed the artillery at the cathedral and castle. When Lennox's garrison surrendered, gallows were set up in the street outside the Tolbooth to hang the leaders.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 283, 292-3. Aftermath For his timely service in the first battle, Robert Boyd was rewarded with the family lands (which he held in tack), as well as the restoration of his family's title of Lord Boyd. Glencairn's eldest son, Alexander Cunningham, Lord Kilmaurs, and Lennox's brother, Robert Stewart, Bishop-designate of Caithness, slipped away from Dumbarton Castle at night through the river Clyde, and then rode through the west country to England.Cameron, Annie I., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, STS (1927), 72. Soon after this battle, in May 1544, an English army burnt Edinburgh. Around 24 May 1544, Hamilton fought another battle on Glasgow Moor with the Earl of Glencairn. Glencairn's son, Andrew Cunningham, and John Hamilton of Cambuskeith, Arran's Master of Household, were killed at this battle. Glencairn retreated, and Lennox, being unable to regain possession of Dumbarton Castle, after it had been seized, sailed for England around 28 May 1544.Scott, A.G., ed., A Diurnal of Remarkable Occurents, (vol.1), Bannatyne Club pp.32-33. Ten years later, a number of men received pardons for their presence at the battle on Lennox's side against the Regent, including: William Cunningham, Earl of Glencairn; George Forrester of Kiddisdale; George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll; Robert Drummond of Carnock; and John Wemyss.Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 4, no. 4504, no. 4506, 8 March 1554: Memorials of Wemyss, vol.2, p.xxxii In Scottish chronicles Writing about thirty years later, John Lesley and Claud Nau give a detailed version of events. In their account, the Governor, Regent Arran, had heard that Lennox had left Glasgow and came with an army including Lord Boyd. Lennox had departed to Dumbarton Castle. The Earl of Glencairn, with his followers and men of the Lennox, Renfrew and Glasgow town, met Arran's forces on Glasgow Muir (Moor) a mile east of the town. After a long fight with many casualties Regent Arran appeared to have won the day. Arran then entered Glasgow and besieged the Bishop's Palace and Cathedral where Lennox had placed his artillery. The garrison surrendered and 16 or 18 leaders were hanged. Lord Boyd convinced Arran not to destroy and burn more buildings. Lennox sent the Earl of Angus and Lord Maxwell to negotiate a truce but he imprisoned them at Blackness Castle and Hamilton.Thomson, Thomas, ed., Lesley, John, The History of Scotland, (1830), 176-177: Stevenson, Joseph, ed., Claude Nau, History of Mary Stuart, (1883), 334-335. Maxwell was indeed warded at Hamilton Castle in April 1544 and wrote to Mary of Guise for her intercession.Cameron, Annie I., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, STS (1927), 74. George Buchanan also gives a brief account of the battle. Again, while Lennox was absent, Glencairn held off Arran's troops until Robert Boyd's charge. Buchanan mentions the Regent's troops carrying off the window shutters and doors of houses in Glasgow, but not the defence of the Castle and Cathedral.Buchanan, George, History of Scotland, vol. 2, Glasgow, (1827), 342-3, (Bk. 15, cap. 19) Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie describes Lennox's hopes for the regency of Scotland and disappointment with Cardinal Beaton. Lennox and the Earl of Bothwell were set up as rivals for the hand of Mary of Guise. Lennox fortified Glasgow and Arran brought artillery against him. Pitscottie gives the date of the encounter as 28 March 1544 and says the siege lasted 10 days. He adds a detail that the captains of the Castle were won over by promises of gold, then hung. Pitscottie says this was the Cardinal's idea.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, Chronicles of Scotland, vol. 2 Edinburgh (1814), 424-429. Some details check out: there is a record that Lennox was encouraged in the idea he might marry Mary of Guise.Dickinson, Two Missions of de la Brosse, STS, (1942), 39. However, the four later 16th-century chronicles strongly reflect their authors' own political and religious viewpoints and tend to include partisan detail and suggestion.

The test commonly checks for infection, inflammatory disease of the urinary tract, cancer, or precancerous conditions. If a cancerous condition is detected, other tests and procedures are usually recommended to diagnose cancers, including bladder cancer, ureteral cancer and cancer of the urethra. It is especially recommended when blood in the urine (hematuria) has been detected. Urine typically contains epithelial cells shed from the urinary tract, and urine cytology evaluates this urinary sediment for the presence of cancerous cells from the lining of the urinary tract, and it is a convenient noninvasive technique for follow-up analysis of patients treated for urinary tract cancers. For this process, urine must be collected in a reliable fashion, and if urine samples are inadequate, the urinary tract can be assessed via instrumentation, such as a catheter. In urine cytology, collected urine is examined microscopically. One limitation, however, is the inability to definitively identify low-grade cancer cells and urine cytology is used mostly to identify high-grade tumors. If the test detects atypical or cancerous cells, further tests may be recommended, such as cystoscopy and a CT scan.

The series tells the story of Fishtronaut, a fish in a spacesuit, similar to reverse scuba gear, which allows him to fly and breathe out of water. He is a secret agent who, along with his friends Marina and Zeek, unravel the mysteries occurring in the Smiling Trees Park. They solve the mysteries with the help of a P.O.P. (Primary Objective Pod), a magical multicolored ball containing clues vital to the mission. Viewers are invited to dance along with the heroes to a tune, so that the P.O.P. will open and release the clues inside. The series is aimed at children ages 3–7 and debuted successfully on Discovery Kids in Latin America on April 20, 2009. In the international market, the series is marketed by the names of Peztronauta (Spanish) or Fishtronaut (English). After success on TV, Peixonauta was produced as a play called Peixonauta to TV Theatre, which premiered on January 9, 2011 in Rio de Janeiro. On November 9, 2012, a movie titled Peixonauta – Agente Secreto da O.S.T.R.A. (in English: Fishtronaut - Secret Agent of O.Y.S.T.E.R.) was released. As of March 30, 2015, the KiKa series also airs on the Qubo network, owned by Ion Media Networks. The show has been noted for its success in teaching kids to care for the environment. Location The show is set in the Smiling Trees Park, where elephants, monkeys and other animals from around the world roam free. Children are welcome to explore the forest and climb the trees, or ride a sub to the bottom of the cove and its colorful reef. In the park is Quiet Lake, which is fed by a long river. The river also extends beyond the lake into a sandy cove along the ocean. Characters=Main *Fishtronaut (voiced by Cory Doran) – An anthropomorphic big goldfish. He wears a Bubblex suit that allows him to fly out of water. It also has numerous tools useful during missions. He is always watching his friends Marina and Zeek, and investigating the problems of the Smiling Trees Park in order to solve them. He lives at the bottom of Quiet Lake, though he spends more time out on the surface with his friends. He is also an aspiring inventor, creating machines generally useful to the park. He usually communicates through a video screen fitted into his suit. *Marina (voiced by Shannon Chan-Kent) - (full name: Marina Green) – A bright and curious brown-haired 8-year-old human girl who is also Fishtronaut's best friend. Every day, she proves to be a valuable member of the park's spy team. Whenever she and Fishtronaut happen to be apart, she can always use her trusty Aquawatch to stay in touch. *Zeek (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - () – A tween-age monkey who may love to monkey around, but his awesome tree-climbing abilities and finely-tuned sniffer make him invaluable to the team. Though he does come up with the most implausible of theories and even causes the occasional mix- up, his intentions are nothing but the best. Supporting *The Twins – Billy and Mac () are Marina's rascal cousins. Their shenanigans tend to get them (and the park) in a heap of trouble, but they are harmless and have only the best intentions. *Dr. Green () (Voiced by Rick Jones) – Marina and the twins’ grandfather who is also the wise vet/caretaker of Smiling Trees Park. He runs the park's Animal Hospital, which was built in a pod of a giant beanstalk. Whenever Marina's stuck, she knows Grandpa can help her find the answer. *Rosy Barb () (Voiced by Holly Gauthier-Frankel) – A S.E.A. agent who loves color and enjoys decorating the ocean bottom until it's just right. She knows the cove inside out and whenever Fishtronaut's on dry land, he can always check in with Rosy via the Web Clam. *Happy Plumb () (Voiced by Terrence Scammell) – A wise old fish who likes living quietly at the bottom of the cove and knows just about all there is. No one knows how long he's been around, but it's a very long time, indeed. He remembers the very beginnings of Smiling Trees Park. Whenever Fishtronaut is stumped, he knows Happy Plumb can point him in the right direction, that is, if he can decipher Plumb's riddle of an answer.

In 1991, it was included on the national list of monuments of culture of great importance, and since then it has been protected.  History  The castle was built in 1904 by ispán of Torontál County (Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary) Béla Botka. He wanted to create a residence that would resemble a medieval castle, and that was one of the reasons for the construction of the neogothic palace. Kapetanovo is located near the road Vršac–Zrenjanin, about 2 km southwest from the small village of Stari Lec. After losing almost all of his wealth on gambling, owner Béla decided to sell the castle, as the last possible solution to solve his financial situation. After he told his wife Ema about this, she was so devastated that on the night of 2 August 1938, she climbed to the highest tower of Kapetanovo, poured gasoline on herself and burned to death. Nevertheless, in an auction in 1938, Kapetanovo was sold to a wealthy merchant Franc Maj. He purchased it as the main part of his daughter's dowry. After the wedding, she and her husband Milan Kapetanov moved in, and the castle took his name. During this time, Kapetanovo flourished. They created large fountains and gardens all around the castle compound, and the only part that was constantly locked was the tallest tower, where Emma Botka burned herself. Milan was Kapetanovo's owner up until the end of World War II; after the Law on Nationalization, the castle was seized by the communist Yugoslavia's government.  Architecture  Kapetanovo Castle is an example of neogothic architecture. It has two entrances, and around it there was a spacious park (now defunct) with a fountain. One of the most specific architectural specifications is a crow-stepped gable stretching along three sides of castle. With simple white façade and an elevated entrance, the building's harmonious proportions are pointed out with high square towers with crenellation. All the windows have sharp gothic arches, and with false arrow loops on top of the tower, the architect's idea of creating a pseudo-medieval castle is clearly visible.  Restoration  After the nationalization, the castle was mostly abandoned and empty for nearly 40 years. In 1987, reconstruction started, but it was soon abandoned after basic conservation work. Then, in August 2006, vast work on the restoration of the castle commenced, and it was renovated into a restaurant with a hotel. As the castle is under protection of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts as a monuments of culture of great importance, the reconstruction was a faithful restoration of the original design.

It is a sequel of Gianfranco Parolini's 1967 film The Three Fantastic Supermen. It was a commercial success in Italy and also in Hong Kong. Plot FBI agent Robert Wallace has orders to find six Americans who have gone missing in Bangkok. The trace leads to Hong Kong. During his investigation he makes new friends who stand by his side when he is attacked by henchmen. Cast * Robert Malcolm as Robert Wallace * Antonio Cantafora as Max * Salvatore Borgese as Jerry * Lo Lieh as Master Tang * Shih Szu as mysterious young lady * Tung Lin as Chen-Loh * Alberto Farnese as Colonel Roger * Jacques Dufilho as American ambassador * Isabella Biagini as the ambassador's wife Production Supermen Against the Orient was an Italian and Hong Kong co-production. After the death of Bruce Lee, the market for Hong Kong film productions became more restricted. Censorship in Singapore and a quota system for local films in Thailand meant that there was a smaller demand for products from large Hong Kong studios like Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest. This led to both companies seeking respite in overseas productions such as the hybrids between the British Hammer Films (The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires), Rapid Films with their German co-production Enter the Seven Virgins (1974) and Italy's I.N.D.I.E.F. for Supermen Against the Orient. The film differs from other entries in the Three Supermen series as Italo Martinenghi's company Cinesecolo had nothing to do with the production. Jackie Chan is credited among the choreographers in the film. Release Supermen Against the Orient was released in Italy in 1973. Reception Kevin Lyons from The EOFFTV Review stated the film presented \\"lots of very silly\\" moments and an \\"embarrassing collection of worn-out gags\\". However, he considered it amusing for slapstick fans. Andrew Pragasam from The Spinning Image described the film as a \\"lively, if meandering romp\\" with a \\"memorably silly theme song\\".

Best known for his narrative photography, Dweck's work \\"explores ongoing struggles between identity and adaptation in endangered societal enclaves.\\" In 2003, he became the first living photographer to have a solo exhibition at Sotheby's, and in 2012, he was the first American photographer to exhibit his work in Cuba since the beginning of the United States embargo in 1960. He lives and works in New York City and in Montauk, New York. Born in 1957 in Brooklyn, Dweck grew up in Bellmore, Long Island, attending John F. Kennedy High School and then Brooklyn's Pratt Institute to study architecture, communication and fine arts. Upon graduation, Dweck founded Michael Dweck & Co., later known as Dweck & Campbell, winning a number of advertising industry awards before closing the firm in 2001 to pursue his artistic interests. Over the next decade, Dweck built a substantial reputation in fine art photography with works including The End: Montauk, N.Y. (2004,) Mermaids (2008,) and Habana Libre (2011.) In recent years Dweck's artwork has branched into other media including sculpture and filmmaking, with his first feature-length film The Last Race premiering at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.  Early life and education  Dweck was born in Brooklyn in 1957 to David and Sydelle Dweck. The family moved to Bellmore, a town on Long Island about 27 miles east of Manhattan, where David worked as accountant. Dweck's father presented him with his first camera on the occasion of the 1964 New York World's Fair. Dweck graduated from Bellmore's John F. Kennedy High School in 1975. He then attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Initially an architecture student, Dweck switched to communication and fine arts in 1976 at the suggestion of the department, who told him that humor had no place in architecture after he chose to design a house for Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken for a school project. For another project, he designed an AT&T; building to resemble a gigantic phone booth. After receiving his bachelor's degree in 1979, he went on to study with artist James Wines and with semiotician Marshall Blonsky at The New School for Social Research.  Dweck & Campbell  While studying at the Pratt Institute, Dweck was exposed to the creative workings of several prominent New York-based advertising agencies, including DDB and Young & Rubicam. Following graduation, seeking to escape the frustration of what he considered to be an uninspirational creative environment, Dweck set out in 1980 to found his own firm, Michael Dweck & Co. In 1992, Lori Campbell joined the firm as a partner to form Dweck & Campbell. The team quickly earned a reputation for edgy and unconventional work with a mischievous sense of humor. CNN called Dweck a “creative prodigy.” AdWeek's Tim Nudd dubbed him \\"a master of the absurd.\\" Producer Larry Shanet, who contributed to many of the agency's television commercials and went on to win numerous industry awards, said of Dweck, \\"He's not a cookie-cutter guy, and he doesn't make cookie-cutter work.\\" Well-known clients included MTV, Swatch, Comedy Central and Dial-a-Mattress. Dweck & Campbell's second television advertisement, promoting retailer Giant Carpet, depicted George H.W. Bush during the waning days of his administration vandalizing the White House carpets for then-incoming president Bill Clinton. Clinton's communications director George Stephanopoulos telephoned Dweck to complain that he had \\"stag[ed] the mock killing of a president-elect.\\" Under political pressure, network ABC withdrew the ad, but the agency managed to land five slots on NBC's popular late-night comedy show Saturday Night Live. \\"We knew we'd hit a home run,\\" Dweck said. Over the next eighteen months, Giant Carpet expanded its operations from four stores to 42. Still better known was the agency's 1998 television spot for Dial-a-Mattress, which featured a cantankerous man- sized Arctic ground squirrel purchasing a mattress on which to hibernate for the winter. The ad, noted for its comic abrasiveness, was pulled from the airwaves after only 13 days. It then went on to win a Gold Lion award at the Cannes International Advertising Festival, and was selected for inclusion in both the Gale Group's 100 most influential marketing campaigns of the year and Boards magazine's Top 10 Boards awards of 1999. In April 1999, Lori Campbell left the firm, which was renamed Dweck, Inc., or more simply \\"Dweck!\\", with Dweck as chairman and sole creative director. The agency continued to pursue its unorthodox aesthetic sensibilities, and by seventeen months after Campbell's departure had more than doubled its previous year's billings to $50 million. Nearly immediately following the reorganization, Dweck! won the American Association of Advertising Agencies' O'Toole Creative Award for best small agency in the United States. Later in 1999, Dweck!'s spots for Top Driver driving school and UPN won awards from Art Directors Club, Association of Independent Commercial Producers, One Club for Art & Copy and the New York Addys. Bennett Miller, later best known as the Academy Award-winning director of Capote, helped create Dweck!'s spots for Top Driver, in which hidden cameras recorded conversations between instructors and students. These spots were recognized as the Best Low-Budget Campaign by London International Advertising Awards. In July 2001, Dweck closed the agency and left advertising to concentrate on photography. \\"I'm a creative,\\" said Dweck, \\"and I want to get back to working just on creative.\\"  Visual artist =The End: Montauk, N.Y. After closing his advertising agency, in 2002 Dweck began to photograph subjects and scenes around Montauk, focusing on its surfing subculture. Dweck had been visiting Montauk since his second year of high school, beginning when he'd heard that the Rolling Stones were spending time there with Andy Warhol. Instead of finding the Rolling Stones, Dweck and his friends discovered a hidden inlet with a thriving local surfing culture. Dweck would parlay this collection of art photos into the 2003 solo show at Sotheby's in New York and in 2004 his first book, The End: Montauk, N.Y., published by Harry N. Abrams. The 5,000-print run was sold out in less than three weeks. The brisk sell-out of the book was attributed to its local interest, the beauty of the photography, and the allure of the nude models. Artnet describes The End as a blend of nostalgia, documentary and fantasy, with photos that evoke \\"the paradise of summer, youth, and erotic possibility, and of community and camaraderie in a perfect setting.\\" Michael Dweck preparing his Sotheby's installation, New York, September 2003 For decades, Montauk had been undergoing a gradual transformation from a fishing village to a beachside resort. By the 1990s, developers, running out of room in the greater New York region, had begun to focus on the far eastern reaches of Long Island. Wrting for Forbes, art critic Patrick Hanlon called The End an \\"act of preservation,\\" later likening it to \\"an attempt to freeze time.\\" Hanlon quoted Dweck saying, \\"I knew Montauk would change, and I wanted to capture the way Montauk made me feel. I didn’t want it to be sentimental or nostalgic. I wanted that collection of images to freeze Montauk.\\" The best known photograph from the book, Sonya, Poles, depicts a naked young woman running across the beach towards the ocean with a surfboard under her arm. Hanlon compared Sonya to \\"Matisse at the beach.” One print of this photo sold for over $17,000, and then another sold for $30,000. Esquire Magazine dubbed the image \\"best surfboard\\" in its monthly cultural round-up. In March 2010, Dweck filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against a New York-based clothing designer called Malibu Denim, alleging that they'd used Sonya, Poles in their advertisements for designer jeans, even including copies of the photo on the hang tag which accompanied their products. With the jeans selling at $160–200 each, the court awarded Dweck $100,000. Many of the photos from The End were exhibited at numerous galleries and solo exhibitions in New York, Belgium, San Francisco, Monaco, and the Blitz Gallery in Tokyo, and the Gallery Orchard in Nagoya. Dweck's work was also presented at art fairs in Paris and Bologna. Dweck worried that his photographs would call more unwanted attention to the quiet culture of Montauk, saying: > \\"That's the way it always goes, isn't it? Everyone who makes it to the > fallout shelter tries to bolt the door behind him. It's like some graffiti I > read in the stall at the Shagwong Tavern. 'Welcome to Montauk. Take a > picture and get the f--- out.'\\" \\"Here are my pictures. Please, please stay > away just a little longer.\\" In July 2011, it was reported that Kanye West's video director Hype Williams had scouted Montauk as a possible site for a music video. Williams was seen with Dweck's book, looking for the locations featured in it. A second edition of The End: Montauk, N.Y. was scheduled for release in July 2016 by Ditch Plains Press on a short run with a very limited distribution. It was projected that only 300 copies were to circulate, at a price of $3,000 each, with each copy numbered and signed by Dweck, printed on paper made in Italy's Riva del Garda and \\"enclosed in a handmade Japanese box.\\" This limited edition is said to include 85 photographs which were not presented in the first edition. Mermaids Dweck's Mermaid 1 at an exhibition at Maruani & Noirhomme Gallery in Brussels in 2008 Dweck's second book Mermaids was released in 2008 by Ditch Plains Press. Its photographs featured female nudes swimming under water, evoking the legend of the mermaid. As art editor Christopher Sweet described them in his introduction to the book, “Whether diving in the blue refractions of a swimming pool or suspended like a seraph in the cool, pellucid depths of a spring or emerging tentatively onto a rocky shore, Michael Dweck's mermaids are lovely and aloof and bare of all raiment but for their beautiful manes and the elemental draperies that surround them. Water, light, and lens converge to capture in modern guise the elusive creature of myth.” Like his previous book, The End: Montauk, N.Y., Mermaids was inspired by Dweck's experiences interacting with the local environment. While night fishing in the waters off Long Island's south shore, Dweck was captivated by the flashing streaks of light caused by fish swimming beneath him. \\"The idea was, if I happen to fall overboard one night, what would I see down there? Those flashes of light could be mermaids.\\" Mermaids continued the focus on attractive young people in water settings which characterized The End, but departed from The Ends romantic realism to veer into fantasy, with photographs blurring the lines between reality and imagination. Unlike The End, Mermaids was shot in and through the water, using methods for underwater flash photography developed by Harold Eugene Edgerton. The technology required to house and protect large format cameras was not yet widely available, leading Dweck to design his own cases for the project, using weights and pulleys to manipulate the camera. To obtain the desired angles for the shots, Dweck used two different techniques, diving into the water with his subjects, either with a long snorkel or unaided, and shooting from behind a glass wall placed within the river. As Dweck explained it: > I just started to experiment. I said to myself, \\"OK, I have light, I have a > lens and I have water\\" Rather than use professional models, Dweck turned to women with the experience needed to move comfortably and naturally in underwater environments, including friends from his native Long Island's East End as well as residents of the rural fishing village Aripeka, Florida. Shooting took place both locally in Montauk and Amagansett and in the Weeki Wachee River, where some inhabitants of Aripeka, located on a nearby island in the Gulf of Mexico, had been employed to perform at the Weeki Wachee Springs waterpark while costumed as mermaids. According to Christopher Sweet, Dweck met a performer who had been raised in Aripeka and had spent her life in and around water, who then introduced him to other local girls, “some of whom could hold their breath underwater for as long as five or six minutes.” One of Dweck's mermaids on an outdoor mural at the 2015 Canvas art fair in West Palm Beach Photographs from Mermaids were exhibited at galleries in New York, Los Angeles, London, Belgium and Hamburg. Playboy France featured selections in its October 2008 edition under the title \\"Le Bal des Sirènes.\\" One gelatin silver print from the collection entitled \\"Mermaid 1\\" sold at auction in 2009 at Christie's in London for over $17,000, well over initial estimates. In May 2015, Dweck's \\"Mermaid 18\\" sold for £27,500 at Phillips London, over double the initial estimate. For West Palm Beach's Canvas art fair in November 2015, Dweck mounted several murals near the Nicole Henry Fine Art gallery. These murals featured oversized prints of Dweck's mermaids swimming away from the viewer into a black background. On November 17, 2015, Elin Nordegren held a dinner in Dweck's honor at her beachfront home in North Palm Beach, Florida, with guests including Chris Cline and Laura Norman, both of whom, like Nordegren, are avid collectors of Dweck's work. Dishes prepared by her personal chef were based upon themes drawn from both Mermaids and Dweck's earlier work, The End: Montauk, NY. Habana Libre Dweck standing with \\"Giselle and Rachel\\" and \\"Legs\\" during an exhibit of Habana Libre at Miami Beach's Art Basel in December 2012 Dweck's third book, Habana Libre (\\"Free Havana\\"), was published by Damiani editore and depicted the glamorous lives of what Dweck called Cuba's \\"privileged creative class.\\" The book includes the first published photographs of and interviews with Alejandro Castro and Camilo Guevara, sons of Cuba's founding revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara who are also photographers. Other subjects of the book include musicians Francis de Rio and Kelvis Ochoa, painters Rene Francisco, Rachel Valdez and Carlos Quintana, dancer Yaday Ponce Toscano and novelist Leonardo Padura. Upon Dweck's first visit to Havana in 2009, the New York Times' Guy Trebay quotes Dweck recalling, \\"I expected all the crumbling buildings and used cars, the usual clichés.\\" Instead, on the very first night of his stay, he was invited to a party where he was introduced to a farándula, or social circle, of Cuba's idle elites, the members of which had access to expensive gadgets such as iPhones and regularly held cocktail parties and staged fashion shows. Writing for Spain's El País, exiled Cuban poet and essayist Antonio José Ponte observed that these children of revolutionaries had departed from the discretion of previous generations, who'd felt obliged to hide their relative wealth in a political environment of egalitarianism and asceticism, and interpreted their surprising willingness to reveal their lifestyles to an American photographer as a reaction against the constraints of Cuba's Communist Party. The Miami New Times's Kyle Munzenrieder commented that \\"it's hard to tell if [Dweck is] glamorizing the privilege or slyly exposing the hypocrisy of the myth of communist equality\\". A pictorial titled \\"Elit Küba\\" appeared in the Turkish magazine Tempo. New York's Staley-Wise Gallery opened an exhibit of Dweck's work to date, Habana Libre and The End: Montauk, N.Y., to coincide with the release of the Habana Libre book on December 9, 2011. Dweck drew parallels between elite Havana and Montauk, observing, \\"Here are two worldly paradises, both built-up in the 50s and preserved since – for better or worse; both populated by insular groups in some kind of isolation, whether it's self or externally imposed; both beset by threats from without and by new hierarchies from within.\\" Dweck's exhibit at Staley-Wise ran through late January 2012. Dweck at Havana's Fototeca de Cuba museum during his exhibit Habana Libre in February 2012 Starting February 24 and running through March 24, 2012, Habana Libre was exhibited in Havana's Fototeca de Cuba museum, making Dweck the first American contemporary artist to mount a solo exhibition in Cuba since the US embargo on that country began. Expecting around 300 guests, upon his arrival Dweck instead found himself greeted by around 2,000 artists, diplomats and journalists waiting to enter the exhibit. Later that evening, Alex Castro and Camilo Guevara headed upstairs under armed guard to view their own images as Dweck had captured them. Another of Fidel Castro's sons, Alejandro Castro, was to quip, \\"Thanks for making me famous\\" The exhibition showcased photographs from the book rebuilt to a larger scale using an unconventional variety of paper and a printing technique created specifically for the venue. Dweck said, \\"I've been given the honor of being one of the first living American artists to exhibit in Cuba, I felt I had to present something additional as a show of respect and gratitude. The unique motif is meant to honor the beauty of the island's past, reflect the heat of the people and serves as a reflection of their spirit, their future, their potential.\\" Following the exhibition, Dweck donated all 52 photographs, then valued at around $500,000, to the Fototeca de Cuba. In late January 2014, selections from Habana Libre were exhibited at Art Palm Beach in West Palm Beach, Florida, with photographer and critic Elin Spring characterizing Dweck's black and white gelatin silver prints as “positively electric.” From September 2017 to March 2018, Dweck's work from Habana Libre appeared in Cuba IS, a multimedia exhibit exploring life in modern Cuba, at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Century City. Los Angeles. Backed by the Getty Foundation's \\"Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA\\" initiative, the exhibit included an original documentary film produced by the Annenberg Foundation which follows Dweck's and four other featured photographers' work in Cuba. Sculptural Forms Dweck's surfboard The Duke's Mermaid, named after Duke Kahanamoku, exhibited at Art Basel in Miami Beach Recently, Dweck has revisited themes from his first two bodies of work, The End and Mermaids, to create customized surfboards emblazoned with black-and-white silhouette images of mermaids. Dweck describes himself as a casual surfer, and the boards are ridable as well as works of art. The surfboards measure six feet and six inches in length and are handcrafted in California, where silk-screen prints of Dweck's photographs are coated with fiberglass and high-gloss resin to create what ArtDaily describes as “beautiful, handmade surfboard-shaped sculptures that seamlessly merge Dweck’s subject and medium.” They are named after figures who have influenced Dweck's career, such as Harold \\"Doc\\" Edgerton, who developed techniques for underwater flash photography used extensively in Mermaids, and Duke Kahanamoku who is widely credited with popularizing the sport of surfing. ArtDaily quotes Dweck saying of his surfboards: > '“I love the implied movement of these forms, as well as the smooth, fluid > shapes. They become vehicles that transport you to other places… I would > like people to have a transporting experience with the work.” On November 6, 2015 at Phillip's London, Dweck's surfboard The Duke's Mermaid (Sapphire) sold for a world record of $57,000, ranking in the top ten lots for the auction. Another was auctioned in a benefit for Southampton Hospital The Last Race Dweck's first feature-length film, \\"The Last Race,\\" premiered on January 22, 2018 in the U.S. Documentary Competition at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where it was billed as \\"A cinematic portrait of a small town stock car track and the tribe of drivers that call it home as they struggle to hold onto an American racing tradition.\\" Produced and directed by Dweck under the working title \\"Blunderbust\\", it explores and documents the culture of amateur stock car drivers at the Riverhead Raceway in Riverhead, New York and laments the impending destruction of the raceway, the last of what were once 40 on Long Island, at the hands of \\"big-box\\" stores. The Sundance Festival described \\"showdowns between…Max Max-inspired stock cars do[ing] battle on a quarter-mile track,\\" with viewers placed \\"eye to eye with the cars’ snarling grills and white roll bars that protrude like bones out of scarred metal\\" as Dweck \\"turns the raceway into a theater of catharsis while the track’s owners struggle to maintain an American tradition as a real estate boom surrounds them.\\" Like The End, The Last Race builds upon Dweck's attachment to his native Long Island, but with an overtly sociopolitical message not found in previous works. As Dweck states in the synopsis of the film: Dweck at the Riverhead Raceway directing The Last Race > On March 5th, the 10,818th Walmart broke ground in the town of Riverhead NY. > No big deal, right? You drive along just about any road in America and soon > enough you are bound to hit one, and if not a Walmart, it’ll be any of the > other big box stores that have come to define 21st-century American > architecture. Interchangeable concrete boxes with corporate logos tacked on > front. They are all the same, and maybe that’s the idea. The Last Race began in 2007 as a photography project. Riverhead Raceway reminded Dweck of a stock car track near his childhood home in Bellmore, where on Saturday nights he would sneak under the fence to watch the races. Dweck spent several years shooting still photographs of the race cars with an 8\\" x 10\\" camera and acquainting himself with the racing community. As Dweck recounts, \\"I cut the cars apart, I sandblasted them, I photographed the components and then I realized that motion and the emotion of that place were more than still photography alone could capture. It needed to be told through film.\\" \\"Over that time,\\" he said, \\"I created a film in my head. I had a story; I had characters, I knew how they would act, the paths that their lives would take, and the images that they would be a part of.\\" Telling his wife the film would be finished in a month, Dweck spent five years shooting 370 hours of footage, which would ultimately be edited into 74 minutes. By 2014, Dweck had completed the first version of the film under the title Blunderbust. The Independent Filmmaker Project, describing it as “the story of a small town American racetrack fighting for survival when land-hungry corporations come to town,” selected Blunderbust for inclusion in its 2014 Spotlight on Documentaries. This version, nearly three hours long, was centered around a storyline in the manner of a conventional film, with dramatically timed conflict and scenes selected to support the story. Dweck was dissatisfied with the result, saying,\\"So I went back and I looked at all my footage again. I'd say most of everything I loved wasn't in there because it didn't fit that story.\\" He then spent the next few years, including three and a half months in Denmark, re-editing nineteen hours of source footage to create a substantially different work. The plot revolves around a couple in their 1980s, Barbara and Jim Cromarty, who have owned and operated Riverhead Raceway since 1977. With the rise in property values due to development, the Cromartys are offered over $10 million to sell the raceway, the last of its kind on Long Island, which would be replaced by a multiplex movie theater, but refuse to sell it. To sell the track, as the Florida Film Festival explains it, would \\"cast adrift the extended tribe of adrenaline-junky drivers, fans, and families, all inexorably linked to the asphalt oval where blue-collar glory still triumphs over white- collar profit.\\" The Hollywood Reporter's Justin Lowe observes that the film \\"represents more of a living document of a dwindling American subculture than a typical sports documentary\\" in which Dweck \\"explore[s] themes of masculine identity and class representation that underlie stock car racing,\\" with Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com characterizing the track and its racers as \\"nutshells of Americana, testosterone and nostalgia.\\" The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan describes the film as \\"A surprisingly beautiful and immersive examination of the dying world of stock car racing on Long Island, evocative enough to be a kind of stock car symphony all by itself.\\"• Justin Lowe writes for The Hollywood Reporter that the racing scenes \\"create an impressionistic, hypnotic effect that seems to be searching for some kind of emotional truth, rather than attempting a literal representation of the race competition.\\" Stephen Saito attributes this aesthetic to Dweck's background as a photographer rather than a filmmaker. To film the race scenes, cameras were placed at numerous locations around the racecourse as well as on and in the cars themselves. Interviewed by film writer Chris O'Fait for IndieWire about his choice of equipment, Dweck explained that he'd used a Canon EOS C300 camera in order to capture \\"a warm sunlight look that was reminiscent of iconic auto racing films like ‘Days of Thunder’ and the golden glow of 1970s surf photography similar to my earlier photography works,\\" primarily with the Canon L lens due to its compactness and practicality. Vintage lenses by Arri and Zeiss were also employed, as was a Sony F5 camera. For car-mounted cameras which might be damaged by collisions, the smaller and more replaceable Canon EOS 5D Mark III and GoPro were used. Originally tempted to accompany the racing scenes with rock music, Dweck was instead drawn to classical music including the Dies Irae of Mozart's Requiem Mass in D minor. Dweck said that he used the classical music playing on his headphones to guide the composition of many of the shots. For the remainder of the soundtrack, Dweck set up microphones around the raceway and in the cars themselves to sample over 4,000 sounds ranging from revving engines and tools being dropped to telephones being answered in the office. Sound engineer Peter Albrechtsen was paired with composer Robert Goula to create what No Film School's Oakley Andersen-Moore describes as \\"a half- music, half-machine sound design\\" in which the sounds of the track and original music transition seamlessly into one another to create what Dweck characterizes as a \\"distinct audio language,\\" saying, \\"I don’t want the audience to necessarily know where the music stops and starts or where the sound design stops and starts.\\" The Last Race was among the nominees for Sundance's Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary, with a panel of film critics assembled by IndieWire voting it one of the best documentaries of the festival. In April 2018, The Last Race was shown for a second time at the Florida Film Festival in Maitland, Florida, where it won the festival's Special Jury Award for Artistic Vision. On March 27, 2018, Magnolia Pictures acquired the rights to distribute The Last Race in the United States, with release planned for later in the year. The Truffle Hunters Dweck's second feature film, The Truffle Hunters which he co-directed alongside Gregory Kirshaw, follows group of aging men hunting in the woods in Northern Italy, for a prized quarry, the Alba truffle, had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 30, 2020. Luca Guadagnino served as an executive producer on the film. Sony Pictures Classics acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film.

It was opened jointly by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) and the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway (L&MVLR;) in 1905Butt p. 242. and closed in 1943.Christiansen & Miller p. 304. Construction and opening The station was the terminus of two separate railway lines; the NSR branch from Leekbrook Junction and the narrow gauge L&MVLR; from . Both lines were authorised on 1 March 1899 by the Leek, Caldon Low, and Hartington Light Railways Order, 1898. From Leekbrook junction, Waterhouses station was distant. The branch rose until it reached a summit of near making that the highest point on the NSR.Christiansen p. 54. From there the line fell until Waterhouses was reached at an elevation of . The descent necessitated a steep gradient of 1 in 40 (2.5%) that ended only at the end of the station platform.Manifold p. 54. The station itself was on a falling gradient of 1 in 260 (0.38%). The other end of the L&MVLR; at Hulme End was away but construction of the L&MVLR; proceeded faster than that of the NSR line and Waterhouses was reached in 1904 but until the joint station was ready the L&MVLR; used a temporary station located slightly to the east between its opening on 27 June 1904 and 1 July 1905 when the NSR line opened.Manifold p. 20. Station layout Sketch map of Waterhouses station (not to scale) The two lines approached the station from opposite directions; the NSR from the west and the L&MVLR; from the east. Each served a single platform which were back to back to each other but at different heights; the L&MVLR; platform being lower than the NSR one. This resulted in the platforms being separated by railings to prevent passengers and staff falling off one onto the other.Manifold p. 55. The goods facilities were very basic and the main interest was the three interchange sidings allowing standard gauge wagons to be rolled off the end of the siding onto the transporter wagons used, uniquely in the United Kingdom,Ranson p. 258. by the L&MVLR.; The signal box, of 10 levers,Jeuda p. 71. situated at the Leek end of the NSR station controlled all the points and signals on the NSR line but only the home and starting signals on the L&MVLR.; All the other signals and points on the L&MVLR; were hand controlled. Apart from water columns on both lines, there were no other locomotive facilities.Manifold p. 56. On the L&MVLR; platform the platform sign simply read \\"Waterhouses\\" but only the NSR side they read \\"Waterhouses, alight for the Manifold Valley and Froghall Quarries\\" In NSR days the station staff comprised a station master, two porters, a porter/signalman and a booking office clerk.Jeuda p. 73. The NSR employed a permanent way gang of five men as did the L&MVLR.; Services Passenger services were never high and the NSR ran three trains between Leek and Waterhouses, increasing to five on market days in Leek. These services were all matched by a L&MVLR; service to Hulme End and in publication such as Bradshaws services were shown as through services, without mentioning the interchange at Waterhouses.Bradshaw June 1922 table 605 On Sundays there was a single train each way. Freight services were equally sparse with just one goods train per day from the station on market days and two on other days.Jeuda p. 23. The most important traffic between the two lines was milk from the creamery at Ecton, most of which was destined for London. In 1911 were brought in from the L&MVLR; growing to in 1922. Initially all the milk was carried in churns which had to be manhandled across the platforms but after the First World War the churns were loaded into standard gauge vans taken to and from Ecton on the transporter wagons. Eventually milk tankers were also used, again being transferred between Ecton and Waterhouses on the transporters.Manifold p. 28. The importance of the milk traffic was such that between 1919 and 1926 a special milk train ran direct between Waterhouses and London, rather than the vans being shunted between various trains until the milk reached its ultimate destination.Jeuda p. 60. Closure The L&MVLR; was never a financial success and with the closure of the Ecton creamery in 1932 the line became even more uneconomic and closed on 12 March 1934,Christiansen & Miller p. 258. although the last train ran two days earlier. The passenger service to Leek lasted until the following year but was withdrawn on 30 September 1935. The station remained open as a goods station until 1943 when the line between Caldon Junction and Waterhouses closed entirely.Manifold p. 29.  The site today  The site of Waterhouses railway station is now the location for a cycle hire business located at one end of the Manifold Way – a trail constructed on the trackbed of the old L&MVLR.; In July 2013, the preserved Churnet Valley Railway announced the possible extension of its Cauldon Lowe branch line service to Waterhouses where the station could be reinstated as the future terminus of the newly resurrected part of the preserved line.

The group's sound draws on disparate genres such as 1980s synthpop and MIDI-funk, chopped and screwed production, 1970s fusion, and techno. They have released a number of original recordings and remix mixtapes, including the 2011 album Channel Pressure. History=Background First meeting each other in sixth grade at a science class in a Wayland, Massachusetts school, Daniel Lopatin and Joel Ford listened to music from British artist Goldie, Boston campus radio, and jazz fusion albums owned by Lopatin's father during their teen years. While in sixth grade, Lopatin had tried out for being a bassist in Ford's grunge band, The Grainers, but was rejected. However, the band started to create and perform funkier, weirder and more prog-fusion material, and by the time they were in their late high school years, Ford said the group \\"couldn't exist without Dan and his synthesizer.\\" When the two were 15 years old, they began a group called Polyphonic, with Ford using their high school's Ensoniq SQ-2 as a drum machine and Lopatin using a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer. The two recalled jamming in Lopatin's basement and performing at their high school's talent show with other rappers and a DJ. During this period, the two became serious about composing electronic music together. The band ended when Ford and Lopatin graduated from high school. However, the two still kept in touch with each other during their college years, Ford attending University of Massachusetts Amherst and Lopatin a student at Hampshire College, and would briefly form another band that Ford described as \\"kind of like Suicide, but with live drums.\\" Lopatin had started making music in his bedroom which was the beginning of his project Oneohtrix Point Never, whom Ford was with in one of Lopatin's first of these sessions which Ford described as \\"one of the purest listening experiences I've ever had.\\" Ford would move to Brooklyn to form Tigercity after college, where he lived to do the project for six years. In the summer of 2009, they developed an idea for a group they called \\"Games\\" after what Lopatin described as \\"an intense 72-hour internet writing frenzy.\\" They spent a week recording demos at Ford's home in Massachusetts, developing their sound using \\"a ridiculously sick collection of vintage synths\\" the two had collected during their years as musicians. Other musical commitments slowed the work, but by February 2010, the two had moved into an apartment that lacked heat and hot water so they could focus on the project. 2009–2010: That We Can Play From February 1 to April 16, 2010, Games self-released their series of 35-minute chopped and screwed mixtapes, Heaven Can Wait. In a Pitchfork review, the 3rd part of the series was described by Larry Fitzmaurice as \\"tape-warped, syrup-slow R&B; jams\\". It had also been announced that day that they were \\"still hard at work\\" on their yet-unnamed debut EP. On July 1, 2010, the Curatorial Club, a label by the blog Chocolate Bobka, released a double cassette mix of slowed-down tracks by Games titled Spend the Night With...Games. Their early work, which included the 7\\" single of \\"Everything Is Working\\" / \\"Heartlands\\" and their debut extended play That We Can Play, were all officially released by the label Hippos in Tanks. That We Can Play was released on November 2, 2010 to a very positive critical reception, with reviewers praising the duo's use of the 1980s power pop influences. One such writer, Michael Brodeur of The Boston Globe, described the EP as \\"unrelentingly retro, but intriguingly interstitial\\", telling readers to not \\"mistake Games for some out-of-date outfit; this is what’s next – all over again.\\" Some of their early tracks received official music videos, including a now-removed one for \\"Everything is Working\\" that was made by Jheri Evans of the blog Get Off The Coast and showed old footage of cities, suburbs, and car conventions. 2010–2011: Channel Pressure In an August 2010 interview, Ford said that he had recently met in Brooklyn with Jan Hammer's son, who was a fan of the Tigercity project, so he could talk about recording the synths for Games' first full-length album at Hammer's studio in upstate New York, and announced they would begin recording the LP at the studio in December: \\"We're on the concept still, but it definitely involves athletic cuts and smooth jazz-fusion.\\" The album, later named Channel Pressure, was recorded in improvised sessions over the course of three months at the studio and the headquarters of the label Mexican Summer, with the tracks later spliced, sampled and reconstructed. The press release described the record as \\"an imaginary soundtrack for the adventure of Joey Rogers, a kid who gets brainwashed by a gigantic television\\", and musically categorized it as a post- pop album with elements of glitch, krautrock, synthpop, ambient music and progressive-fusion. In February 2011, the duo changed their name to Ford & Lopatin, reportedly to preempt legal issues with the Interscope Records artist Game, and also announced that they had founded a sub-label of Mexican Summer, named Software. Channel Pressure was the first release on the label. Style In an October 2010 interview, Lopatin described the idea behind Games as \\"looking to cook down stuff we like such as ‘70s fusion and hip hop and IDM and techno and midi funk into something primordial and pop-oriented and fun and weird.\\" He also said, \\"We like slowing down fast jams. It’s creepier and subliminal that way. If you just straight up slow everything down into oblivion it’s kinda hectic.\\" As Games in August 2010, Ford and Lopatin cited the works of DJ Paul, DJ Screw, Electric Light Orchestra, Aphex Twin, DJ Premier, The Weather Channel, Weather Report, Return to Forever, Boards of Canada and James Ferraro, as well as genres like Italo disco and albums like Moment of Truth by Gang Starr and On the Corner by Miles Davis, as influences. The two said DJ Premier and Teo Macero were their favorite producers: \\"Their cuts and edits always recontextualize performances and samples in the most psychedelic way.\\" Lopatin also said: [Gang Starr's] \\"Robin Hood Theory\\" is a blueprint-level jam for us. There's other, lesser discussed [DJ Premier] beats that are just as good, but Moment of Truth was a classic when we were in high school and really got us moving in the direction of samplers and stuff like that.\\" As for developing remixes, Ford said that they \\"preserve minimal amounts of original track; create whole world underneath.\\" Discography *\\"Everything Is Working\\"/\\"Heartlands\\" 7\\" (Hippos in Tanks, 2010) *That We Can Play 12\\" EP (Hippos in Tanks, 2010) *Channel Pressure (Software Recording Co., June 7, 2011) *\\"Emergency Room 12\\"\\" (Software Recording Co., 2011) References Category:American electronic music groups Category:American musical duos Category:Electronic music duos ","title":"Ford &amp; Lopatin"},{"id":"29655037","text":"The Mystery Trend was an American garage rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1964. The band was among the first wave of San Francisco rock groups to emerge from the city's growing music scene. Exhibiting music prowess leaning toward R&B;, the Mystery Trend were set apart from their contemporaries who later developed into psychedelic rock groups. Their recording output was limited, with the group's one single, \\"Johnny Was a Good Boy\\", being released in 1967. History The group came to fruition in 1964 thanks to Ron Nagle (keyboards, vocals), an R&B; enthusiast enamored with the recordings of Ray Charles. While studying at San Francisco State College, he met Larry Bennett (lead vocals), who also shared similar musical tastes. As the British Invasion brought rock and roll back to the conscience of San Francisco's pop audience, Nagle and Bennett formed the Terrazzo Brothers with fellow college students Bob Cuff (rhythm guitar), Mike Daly (bass guitar), and John Luby (drums). For the most part, the band tended to remove themselves from the music of the Beatles, instead playing interpretations of R&B; songs. After a year, the Terrazzo Brothers saw Daly assume the role of manager, Bennett taking his former position, and newcomer Larry West (lead guitar) was brought in to fill the group's vacancy at guitar. The band swapped changed moniker to the Mystery Trend upon a misinterpretation of the \\"Mystery Tramp\\" featured in the lyrics to Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". The Mystery Trend developed a local following, becoming one of the earliest rock groups to perform at the Matrix. In the same regard, the band was one of the first ensembles to be associated with the San Francisco Sound, alongside the original Jefferson Airplane, the Great Society, the Charlatans, and the Vejtables, among their other contemporaries. They also were involved in three Mime Troup Benefits, which hold significance as they were promoter Bill Graham's earliest attempts at advertising rock music to the public. During their brief stints at the Matrix, the Mystery Trend exhibited a cutting-edge style unique to their music scene that produced unconventional chord progressions. Unlike their contemporaries, the band was less interested in the free-form psychedelia-tinged instrumentals that came to define San Francisco's music scene, but rather they attempted to pack multiple influences into organized structures. In December 1965, the Mystery Trend was recorded during a performance at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Their set list has been circulated through record collectors and offers an insight into the band's development as a live act and their songwriters. Music historian Alec Palao, writing on the recording in his magazine Cream Puff War, characterizes the band to be \\"Concurrent with the Great Society, the Trend seemed to have absorbed an experimental, easternish feel to their songwriting by late 1965. Both 'I Wish I Knew' and 'Casbah' reflect this, with droning guitars and sighing harmonies, not unlike some of the Velvet Underground's early stuff; not as noisy or distorted as that band but with similar crescendos of sound\\". West departed the band in early 1966, after smashing his guitar in the middle of a gig with the Great Society. Cuff filled in at guitar, but he too left the Mystery Trend and was replaced by John Gregory. The group's out-of-synch musical style proved to be their downfall as several San Francisco bands began agreeing to recording contracts and receiving considerable airplay. Aside from their one-off single, \\"Johnny Was a Good Boy\\" in 1967, with Verve Records, the Mystery Trend were completely unrepresented recording-wise. Verve Records failed to adequately promote the release and the single was a commercial flop. Frank Weber, manager of the Kingston Trio, recorded demos with the band that went unreleased until they were officially issued by Big Beat Records in 1999, on the So Glad I Found You album. In 1968, the group disbanded, mostly due to their inability to gather enough interest in a record deal. All members, except Bennett, still were at the least partially involved in later music career. Nagle released some solo works, penned \\"Don't Touch Me There\\" for the Tubes, and also became a successful ceramic artist. John Gregory played in later line-ups of the Blues Project, from 1968.

Background and education Lang was born on 8 October 1945 in Zagreb. His father was a prominent Croatian university professor, Rikard Lang, and his mother was from the notable Sorkočević family of Dubrovnik. Lang's paternal grandfather Ignjat Lang was president of the Jewish community of Vinkovci and his grandmother Terezija was a housewife. In 1941, a Dominican priest Hijacint Bošković, attempted to rescue the Langs from Nazi persecution. Bošković traveled from Dubrovnik to Vinkovci with a special permit that allowed him to relocate the Langs to Dubrovnik. Lang's grandfather refused to leave, saying he \\"was the president of Jews in peace and he will stay one in the war\\". Both of Lang's grandparents were killed at Jasenovac during the Holocaust.Globus, 21 June 1992; retrieved 30 April 2011. \\"Moja baka Terezija Lang i moj djed Ignjat Lang bili su Židovi. Živjeli su u Vinkovcima. On je bio predsjednik Židovske općine, a ona vrlo poštovana domaćica i gospođa predratnih Vinkovaca. Rat su dočekali u Vinkovcima. Godine 1941. fra Hijacint Bošković, jedan od cijenjenih dubrovačkih i hrvatskih dominikanaca, izvanredno se angažirao u pokušaju da ih spasi. S tom je svrhom putovao iz Dubrovnika u Vinkovce. Sa sobom je imao posebnu dozvolu da moga djeda i baku povede u Dubrovnik. Od najranijeg djetinjstva odgajan sam u osjećaju zahvalnosti prema fra Hijacintu, dominikancima i svim fratrima. Nažalost, ponos cijele obitelji, moj djed, odbio je napustiti Vinkovce, rekavši fra Hijacintu: \\"Bio sam predsjednik Židova u miru i ostat ću to i u ratu.\\" Već sam prije opisao kako je ubijen. Moja baka, zajedno s njim, odvedena je u koncentracioni logor, premda je već bolovala od zloćudne bolesti. U logoru joj, međutim, nisu dopustili ni da umre od te bolesti, nego su je na strašan način ubili.\\" Lang graduated from the University of Zagreb School of Medicine with a specialty in social medicine. Later life and career From 1986-90, Lang was a member of the executive council of the city of Zagreb and secretary of the secretariat of health. He co-organized the Libertas convoy in 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence to bring humanitarian aid to besieged Dubrovnik. In 1991, Lang organized a protest against the JNA in Zagreb and a protest against anti-semitism. He was president of the Croatian Healthy Cities Network and vice president of the Croatian Association of Public Health, as well as a member of several editorial boards of medical and other journals, member of the Committee for Human Rights and Peace of Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences, honorary member of the Croatian Red Cross and honorary member of the Croatian Helsinki Committee. Lang was President of the assembly of the Croatian-American Society. He was the author of more than 100 professional and scientific articles, and authored and co-authored several books. Lang was a personal adviser to President Franjo Tuđman for humanitarian affairs in the period from 1993 until 2000. Lang was a member of the Zagreb Jewish community. On February 12, 2010, he was seriously injured in a car accident, but he recovered from his injuries. In 2012, Lang criticized the statements of Croatia President Ivo Josipović when the latter addressed the Israeli Knesset on February 2012 and apologized for the crimes committed against the Jews in Croatia during World War II. Lang accused Josipović of left wing antisemitism, and of insulting Croats, Jews and Franjo Tuđman for not recognising the communist crimes of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against the Croats and Jews. Lang stated: \\"Josipović spoke in the Knesset without truth, justice, accountability and good for Croatia, Israel and the world. President Ivo Josipović was supposed to deliver a speech in Israel about the two small nations who have shown that there are no small nations. Members of the Knesset should have heard about the pride of Croats from the man whom the Croatian people entrusted to speak about the truth and good, to present the Croatian experience of suffering, trials, persecutions and slander, with the aim of joint efforts for the good of our peoples and for the good of all mankind.\\" See also Rikard Lang References Category:1945 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Zagreb Category:Croatian Jews Category:Croatian physicians Category:Jewish physicians Category:Jewish Croatian politicians Category:Democratic Centre (Croatia) politicians Category:Croatian Democratic Union politicians Category:School of Medicine, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Homeland War Memorial Medal recipients Category:Order of Nikola Šubić Zrinski recipients Category:Recipients of the Order of Duke Branimir ","title":"Slobodan Lang"},{"id":"29655174","text":"Silver Spring Networks, a subsidiary of Itron, is a provider of smart grid products, headquartered in San Jose, California, with offices in Australia, Singapore, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. Besides communications devices, Silver Spring Networks develops software for utilities and customers to improve energy efficiency. Founded in 2002 backed by venture capital, Silver Spring Networks went public on the New York Stock Exchange on March 13, 2013. Itron acquired Silver Spring Networks in January 2018 for $830 million. History Silver Spring Networks was founded in July 2002 as Real Time Techomm in Butler, Wisconsin, near Milwaukee. Original founders included Eric Dresselhuys who had worked on related technology since 1995, and Keith Burge. In 2002, funding came from Denver angel investor Jack Thompson. The company adopted the name of the street in Milwaukee of its original office and was relocated to Redwood City, California in 2003. At this time, Foundation Capital invested $8 million in the company and Raj Vaswani joined the founding team. Ray Bell became interim CEO and chief technology officer, but left to found Grid Net in 2005. Other investors included Northgate Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Google. The company moved its headquarters to San Jose in 2016. The first large pilot deployment was started in 2007 with Florida Power & Light (FPL) in southern Florida. In 2008, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;) signed an agreement to provide the company's smart meters, and remained the largest customer for at least several years. On July 7, 2011, Silver Spring Networks filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $150 million in an initial public offering. Silver Spring Networks went public under the listing symbol SSNI on the New York Stock Exchange on March 13, 2013, raising about $81 million.  Technology  Silver Spring Networks develops equipment that creates wireless mesh networks and transmits energy consumption data between meters, consumers and utilities in real time. The software indicates how much money is spent on electricity and indicates how much can be saved if one switches to energy- efficient models. The meters in the PG&E; deployment include two radios: one in the unlicensed ISM band of 902 to 928 MHz for communication back to the utility provider, and another intended for future communication to a home network. The technology has low bit rate requirements, but also needs to be very low cost. Silver Spring is a partner with more than 40 companies and provides additional applications to utilities and customers on the Smart Energy Platform like smart thermostats, in-home displays, and electric vehicle (EV) charging technology. Silver Spring began its technology offering with a smart grid network based on Internet Protocol (IP) technology, which was advocated for the smart grid by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other smart grid experts. Silver Spring expanded on the network to smart grid application software that includes demand response (DR), demand management and other services for utilities and their customers. In October 2009 Silver Spring acquired Greenbox Technology, and developed its web-based software into a product called CustomerIQ. In an Oklahoma Gas & Electric pilot program involving 2,500 homes in the summer of 2010 on Silver Spring’s Smart Energy Platform, participants saw an average energy use drop of up to 33 percent during the highest price periods. The pilot consisted of several groups using Silver Spring’s web-based energy management solution as well as smart thermostats and in-home energy displays on various dynamic pricing schemes.

History  The first council was created in 1957 and was based on the traditional practices of the Aymara people and the need to respond to widespread poverty, corruption and violence throughout Bolivia and El Alto. Fejuve itself was created in 1979 after a mass meeting of neighbourhood councils decided to create an alliance. Since then, Fejuve has grown to be on par with the city government.  Government  Councils have around 200 members that meet once a month and make decisions through discussion and consensus. Political party leaders, merchants, real estate speculators, and those who collaborated with the dictatorship are not allowed to be delegates between councils. The councils have been successful in blocking the Bolivian government's plan to privatise natural gas and water reserves, introduce new taxes and have been successful in creating the cities first public university.  Economy  The economy of Fejuve resembles syndicalism and mutualism in that there is a high degree of worker's self-management and common ownership despite operating in a very localised market economy. Councils are also able to pull together resources to build parks, schools, clinics, housing, cooperatives and install water connections, sewerage outlets, electrical cables and garbage collection services to fill the hole that the state and private sector have left.  Law and order  In response to the violence and corruption of Bolivia's state police, Fejuve has created its own justice system. Councils act as mediators between minor disputes with neighbours and practice a degree of restorative justice based upon traditional Aymaran customs. Communities also form collective self-defense groups which are known to execute thieves, rapists and murders whilst hanging dolls outside of the houses of victims as a warning to any future attackers.

I am not the sponsor of this legislation, nor have I ever endorsed or spoken in favor of it.\\" The Massachusetts Executive Office of Administration and Finance defines a 'free petition' as: \\"In Massachusetts all citizens have the right to petition the state legislature. This procedure is called the right of free petition. A citizen drafts and files a Petition and accompanying Bill. A legislator sponsors the Bill in the General Court. If a legislator disagrees with the contents of the Bill, he/she may indicate this by placing the phrase 'By request' after his/her name.\\" The text of S787 specifies that it was filed by \\"Richard J.

It has between five and nine narrow egg-shaped, purplish green leaves with a central white stripe and up to fourteen green and white resupinate flowers with the lateral sepals held nearly horizontally.  Description  Rhomboda polygonoides is a terrestrial, tuberous, perennial herb with between five and nine purplish green to bronze coloured, narrow egg-shaped leaves with a broad central white stripe. The leaves are scattered along the flowering stem and are long and wide. Between five and fourteen resupinate, green and white flowers, long and wide are borne on a more or less hairy flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg- shaped, about long, wide and is fused to the petals forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are green, about long, wide, held almost horizontally and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are translucent white, long and about wide. The labellum is about long, wide with inrolled edges, a narrow central region and a deep pouch at its base. Flowering occurs from June to August in Australia but over a longer period in New Guinea. Taxonomy and naming The velvet jewel orchid was first formally described in 1873 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Goodyera polygonoides from a specimen collected near Rockingham Bay. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. In 1995, Paul Ormerod changed the name to Rhomboda polygonoides. The specific epithet (polygonoides) refers to a perceived similarity of this species to a plant in the genus Polygonum. The suffix -oides is a Latin ending meaning \\"likeness\\".  Distribution and habitat  In Australia the orchid has been recorded from three tropical rainforest locations in north-east Queensland between the Paluma Range and the Daintree River, at altitudes of 450 to 600 m above sea level, growing on the forest floor. It occurs within the Wet Tropics of Queensland Natural Resource Management Region. Plants have been collected in notophyll vine forest, on the tops of granite boulders, flat rocks and the rotting wood of fallen trees. Conservation The orchid is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Regulation 2006. All known populations lie within protected areas. Potentially, the main threats to the orchid in Australia are illegal over- collection by orchid enthusiasts, and from feral pigs.

Early life The Columbia Boll made many claims later in life that she was an heiress and was a member of a wealthy family. The truth was that her father, George, was a bartender in Rochester, New York. She was, however, attractive, a short, dark-eyed, and \\"vividly blonde\\" beauty. Her early employment was selling cigars in Rochester.\\"Aeronautics: Tale of Two.\\" Time, June 18, 1928. Boll became an experienced horse rider,Sloate 1990, p. 41. and married businessman Robert Scott in 1909. In 1914 she had a son, Robert Scott II.

In 1922, Boll married Colombian coffee king Hernando Rocha, who presented her with over a million dollars in jewels and an emerald- cut diamond bearing her name \\"The Mabel Boll\\". The diamond was purchased by the Harry Winston collection upon Boll's death in 1949. In 1934, Boll made headlines again as the \\"Countess de Porceri\\" in Nice, France when her 27-year- old boyfriend Georges Chariot shot himself on her lawn.Rochester Evening Journal, May 15, 1934.

Aviation=Transatlantic fever 1927 was full of publicity surrounding Charles Lindbergh winning the Orteig Prize for his non-stop flight from New York to Paris. Boll wanted publicity as well and felt that being the first woman to cross the Atlantic would be headline news. While living in Paris, France, Boll announced she would pay 100,000 francs to any pilot who would fly her across the Atlantic from Paris.Butler 1997, pp. 146–147. Flights in the Columbia Admiral Byrd and Charles A. Levine competed for the Orteig prize, but missed out. Each completed record flights shortly thereafter. While in Europe, Boll attempted to get Levine to fly her to America in the Columbia, which was still in France after a record-setting flight from New York. The inexperienced owner of the aircraft, Levine, had plans to fly it back to America with a French pilot, Maurice Droughin. After disagreements with Droughin and lawyers left the aircraft guarded and grounded, Levine took off to England claiming he was just testing the engine. (Chamberlain claimed that Levine bribed the guards.) Boll followed Levine to England by boat, talking Levine into letting her be a passenger. Just before the flight, Levine's new pilot, Capt. Walter G. R. Hinchliffe, publicly refused to fly if Boll was a passenger and instead, she flew to Rome, dropping a present to Benito Mussolini's son. Boll was invited to try an east-west flight from America and she set out for New York by boat in January 1928.Butler 1997, p. 180. On March 5, 1928, Wilmer Stultz, Oliver Colin LeBoutillier, and Boll on an improvised seat, made the first non-stop flight in the Columbia between New York City and Havana, Cuba, placing Boll on the front page of the New York Times. Boll was sued a month later by Levine's company for $12,000 plus interest.The Milwaukee Journal, May 22, 1928. Boll was known as a temperamental passenger, once injuring pilot Erroll Boyd with an Alligator handbag in flight for making a premature landing in bad weather.Smyth 1997, pp. 68–69. In 1928, the same teams that attempted to win the Orteig Prize were competing to be the first to fly a woman across the Atlantic (as a passenger). Levine chose the flamboyant Boll. On the other extreme, Amelia Earhart was chosen as a demure and capable pilot sponsored by George Palmer Putnam and Amy Phipps Guest. On June 26, 1928, Boll was filmed leaving Roosevelt Field in the Columbia.\\"Mabel Boll in race to fly over Atlantic.\\" Gaumont. Retrieved: February 7, 2013.

While Boll publicly announced her aspiration to be the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, Amelia Earhart was also in Newfoundland at the same time, along with the German Thea Rasche. The newspapers focused their attention on the aspirations of “The Diamond Queen of Broadway”. Preparations for the trip were done with full publicity. At the same time in relative secrecy, pilots Wilmer Stultz and Gordon were believed by the press to be preparing Byrd’s Fokker “Friendship” for his planned trip to the South Pole. Stultz himself planned to be the pilot of the Columbia and defected to Byrd's crew.Thurman, Judith. \\"Missing Woman Amelia Earhart’s flight.\\" The New Yorker, September 14, 2009.

Plans were made for Bert Acosta to fly Boll and Levine from Paris to New York for a new record, which was changed to a London to New York attempt.

It is sold in many countries worldwide, including the United States on AT&T; Mobility and low-end pay-monthly contracts in the UK. It originally shipped running Android 1.6 but was upgraded in early 2011 to Android 2.1. Hardware The phone has a capacitive touch screen LCD. It has a resolution of 320 by 480 pixels half- size video graphics array (HVGA) with 24-bit depth. On the back is a 3.2-megapixel camera with fixed focus. Photos can be geotagged. The camera can be accessed via the touchscreen menu, or via the dedicated camera button on the side of the phone. The Xperia X8 uses a 600 MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 processor, has a 3-axis accelerometer and built-in Global Positioning System (GPS), a digital compass, an ambient light sensor and a lug for attaching a strap. Multi-touch support was also added to several aftermarket firmware versions (ROMS) as a sideloaded modules (Now newer kernel included the code to enable it) which enabled users to use basic multitouch gestures such as pinch to zoom (On Synaptics digitizer) and real dual-touch (On Cypress digitizer) thanks to XDA Recognized Developer doixanh, AnDyx & andrej456, something that Sony Ericsson was adamant was impossible on the X8. Software Sony Ericsson has made its own custom overlay on the Android system using an optimized version of the UX (user experience) interface, which consists of design elements, themes and custom applications. The four corners of the screen have replaceable shortcuts for commonly used applications. The main application is Sony Ericsson Timescape, a social networking application that combines messages from Facebook, Twitter, SMS and email into a flowing column on the home screen. Photos may be attached to contacts or sent to a Facebook account. The phone contains expected smartphone applications, and Wisepilot Navigation Software, Google Maps, YouTube, Sony's PlayNow Arena and TrackID (to identify a song by recording a small part of it). Sony Ericsson was widely criticized by X8 users for failing to provide Android firmware upgrades to 2.2 Froyo or 2.3 Gingerbread. They later stated that the phone's hardware was unable to run anything beyond 2.1 Eclair. They were later proved wrong by the Android modding community, who released their own versions of Android 2.2 and 2.3 in subsequent months, which ran stably on the X8. CyanogenMod released a 2.3 update for the X8 which required rooting. Since then, independent developers have made a fully working Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) port, Jelly Bean (4.1 & 4.2) port as well as the latest Android KitKat (4.4) using a custom kernel.

Baghdad parish priest  Al-Bazi was vicar of the St. Elia (alt: Elias) Catholic Church, and the adjacent St. Elia Catholic School in the \\"working class\\" New Baghdad neighborhood of Baghdad. By 2010, the school had an 82 percent Muslim enrollment, as a result of the exodus of Christians from Iraq. In his autobiography, Norman Kember relates that Al-Bazi described his church as having been bombed ineffectively by unidentified anti-Christian elements and as a church where members of several denominations worshiped together. According to Zenit News Agency the church was attacked twice in the year before Father Douglas was kidnapped; the Father was shot during one of the attacks. Father Douglas fled from Baghdad, his hometown, to Erbil in 2013.  2006 kidnapping  In November 2006 Father Douglas was kidnapped by an Islamist group. He was tortured and released nine days later. He suffered multiple injuries including two broken vertebrae from his spinal cord, and his face and knees were smashed using a hammer. An Ak-47 bullet still remains in his leg. He was released after the Chaldean Catholic Church paid $170,000 in ransom for the release of al-Bazi and Father Samy Al Raiys by their kidnappers.  Refugee camp priest  Al-Bazi is known for sheltering hundreds of Christian war refugees who escaped from the ISIL conquest expansion in August 2014 to Mar Elia Church in Erbil, Iraq where he is the parish priest, and founder and manager of a refugee camp. Father Douglas built the refugee camp in part of the church property previously furnished with benches and used as a small garden, now it is a refuge for Christians fleeing persecution in ISIL-dominated regions of Iraq. Many of the refugees are from Qaraqosh. The camp, which is located in the predominantly Christian Ankawa neighborhood of Erbil, boasts prefabricated housing units, a library, and an emphasis on education. Funding has come predominantly from Canada. By November 2014, Mar Elia, which hosts about 700 refugees, was one of six churches in Erbil sheltering about 3,000 Christian families. Al-Bazi described the ethnic cleansings being carried out by ISIL in 2015 as \\"genocide\\". In September 2015, the Knights of Columbus released for national broadcast in the U.S. a television commercial featuring Father Douglas in the hope of encouraging more Americans to donate money for the relief of Christian refugees. In the commercial, al Bazi asks viewers to \\"pray for my people, help my people, and save my people\\" saying that, \\"genocide is the easy word for what is happening to my people.\\" Anti-Christian genocide in the Middle East Father Al-Bazi has spoken out against the genocide of Christians by ISIL.

Career Mayer was born 8 March 1911 at Rouffach, in Alsace- Lorraine. He served with the Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War with 1. Staffel, Jagdgruppe 88, claiming eight victories. On his return from Spain Oberleutnant Mayer was posted to 1. Staffel, Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing), becoming Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) in October 1939. He claimed his first victory of World War II on 5 November 1939 downing a French Potez 63. Mayer claimed eight more victories during the Battle of France, including five aircraft shot down on 14 May 1940 alone. During the Battle of Britain he then shot down two Hurricanes over the Isle of Wight on 12 August 1940. On 25 August Mayer shot down a Hurricane for his 15th victory, that of F/L AWA Bayne (8 victories) of 17 Squadron, who bailed out. The next day Mayer shot down two Spitfires. One of his victim was ace Sgt Cyril Babbage (7 victories) of No. 602 Squadron RAF, who bailed out. Hauptmann Mayer was awarded the Ritterkreuz on 3 September. Mayer was made Gruppenkommandeur I./JG 53 on 1 September 1940, and recorded his 30th victory on 15 September. On 17 October 1940 Mayer took off on a test flight and never returned, his body washing up on the English coast 10 days later. He was possibly a victim of RAF ace F/L D.

The product is then heated in the presence of a radical initiator and a suitable hydrogen donor to afford the decarboxylated product. This is an example of a reductive decarboxylation. Using this reaction it is possible to remove carboxylic acid moieties from alkyl groups and replace them with other functional groups. (See Scheme 1) This reaction is named after its developer, the British chemist and Nobel laureate Sir Derek Barton (1918–1998). :Scheme 1  Mechanism  The reaction is initiated by homolytic cleavage of a radical initiator, in this case 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), upon heating. A hydrogen is then abstracted from the hydrogen source (tributylstannane in this case) to leave a tributylstannyl radical that attacks the sulfur atom of the thiohydroxamate ester. The N-O bond of the thiohydroxamate ester undergoes homolysis to form a carboxyl radical which then undergoes decarboxylation and carbon dioxide (CO2) is lost. The remaining alkyl radical (R·) then abstracts a hydrogen atom from remaining tributylstannane to form the reduced alkane (RH). (See Scheme 2) The tributyltin radical enters into another cycle of the reaction until all thiohydroxamate ester is consumed. N-O bond cleavage of the Barton ester can also occur spontaneously upon heating or by irradiation with light to initiate the reaction. In this case a radical initiator is not required but a hydrogen-atom (H-atom) donor is still necessary to form the reduced alkane (RH). Alternative H-atom donors to tributylstannane include tertiary thiols and organosilanes. The relative expense, smell, and toxicity associated with tin, thiol or silane reagents can be avoided by carrying the reaction out using chloroform as both solvent and H-atom donor. It is also possible to functionalize the alkyl radical by use of other radical trapping species (X-Y + R· -> R-X + Y·). The reaction proceeds due to the formation of the stable S-Sn bond and increasing aromaticity of the thiohydroxamate ester. There is also an overall increase in entropy due to the formation of gas which drives the reaction forward. :500x500px See also * Barton–McCombie deoxygenation * Hunsdiecker reaction * Kochi reaction * Krapcho decarboxylation * Kolbe electrolysis  References  External links  * Barton Decarboxylation at organic-chemistry.org * Barton Decarboxylation at themerckindex.cambridgesoft.com Category:Organic reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Barton decarboxylation"},{"id":"29655861","text":"Game Day Recycling is the idea that having large crowds of people in a small, concentrated space will generate great amounts of trash and products that need to be recycled.

Yale University Categories The EPA divided the competition into five categories and awards are presented for each category. 1) Waste Generation The Waste Generation category determines the ranks of schools by their per capita weight of waste generated. This is calculated by measuring the total waste produced, which includes trash, recyclables and compostables and dividing it by the total attendance at the game. This figure is the amount of waste that is produced per person at the game. The University with the lowest per capita waste generation wins the waste generation category. 2) Diversion Rate The Diversion Rate category ranks schools based on their recycling rate, which is measured by comparing the amount of waste recycled to the total waste produced. The winner of this category is the school that has the largest recycling rate. 3) Greenhouse Gas Reduction This category ranks schools based on their reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. As waste sits in municipal landfills, greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. However, when waste is recycled, these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. The total reductions in emissions that are identified with the schools waste reduction accomplishments are calculated using the EPA’s WARM factors that are programmed in the WasteWise Re-TRAC system. The greenhouse gas reductions are divided by the total game attendance, in order to get a number for the greenhouse gas emission reductions per person. The school with the highest greenhouse gas reduction rate wins. 4) Recycling The Recycling category ranks schools by the amount of material recycled per person. The weight of recycled material including paper, plastic, glass and cardboard will be totaled and divided by the number of people in attendance at the game. The winner of this category is the school that has the highest recycling rate. 5) Organics Reduction Organics Reduction category bases their ranking on the per capita weight of reduced organics. The overall weight of reduced organics, which incorporates compostable materials that are either donated, reused, or composted will be divided by the number of people attending the game. The winner of this category is the school with the highest organic reduction rate. Results for the 2009 EPA GameDay Challenge In 2009, more than 40,000 pounds of waste were reduced through the combined efforts of the eight schools. This is equal to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 105 metric tons. This number is comparable to the amount of greenhouse emissions that are produced annually from the consumption of about 12,000 gallons of gasoline or equal to the annual emissions generated from about 4,400 propane cylinders used to fuel gas grills. The University of Colorado placed first in the categories of Diversion Rate, Gross Green House Gas Reductions through Waste Reduction and Per Capita Composting. Ohio University ranked first in Per Capita Waste Generation. Harvard University took the first place rank in Per Capita Recycling. The results from the 2010 Game Day Challenge will be posted on the EPA website on November 30, 2010.

Matheson was born on April 7, 1949 in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Jack and Peggy Matheson. Matheson had an intention to follow the footsteps of his father, Jack, a long-time sports editor for the Winnipeg Tribune. He graduated from the University of Manitoba with a degree in political science, and while in school, worked a part-time night shift with the Tribune. He got his first job upon completing school with the Regina Leader-Post, but moved west to Edmonton, Alberta six months later. Upon moving to Edmonton, Matheson got a job with the Edmonton Journal in 1970. He initially covered local curling and university sports, but quickly switched to hockey, when, in 1973, Edmonton was granted a WHA franchise, the Edmonton Oilers. Matheson became the beat writer for the Oilers then, and continued when the Oilers joined the NHL in 1979. He spent countless hours covering the team and its five Stanley Cups, and completed more than 300 stories per winter. In addition to writing, Matheson also was a part of the CFRN radio broadcasting team that covered the Oilers. After 24 years, he completed his tenure as beat writer for the Oilers in 1997. He now continues to write for the Edmonton Journal covering the NHL and the Oilers. Matheson resides in Edmonton with his wife, Marni. They have one son, Scott.

The mountain is the site of a popular hiking trail that begins on the north side of Route 14 at milepost 53. The trail winds through heavy forest to meadows and the site of a former fire lookout. After climbing steeply for about the first half mile (0.8 km), the trail splits into two forks that meet again at the summit. The lookout was built in 1931 and reconstructed in 1952 to watch for fires across the river in Oregon's Mount Hood National Forest. Outmoded by surveillance from roads and airplanes, the fire lookout was dismantled in 1967. Attractions include views of the Columbia Gorge, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and wildflowers, especially in May. Flowering plants along the trail include chocolate lily, woodland star, fairy slipper, hookspur violet, yellow fawn lily, balsamroot, and Columbia kittentails. Hazards include poison oak, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and steep slopes. The trail's difficulty caused one writer to describe it as \\"a grueling hike\\", while another said that Dog Mountain might better be called \\"Dogged Mountain or possibly Doggone Mountain\\", and recommended good boots for descending its steep pitches. A fatality occurred on the mountain in 2003, when a hiker lost her footing and fell .

This concept is based on the observation that all children acquire their first language in a fixed, universal order, regardless of the specific grammatical structure of the language they learn. Linguistic research has largely confirmed that this phenomenon is true for first-language learners; order of acquisition for second-language learners is much less consistent. It is not clear why the order differs for second-language learners, though current research suggests this variability may stem from first-language interference or general cognitive interference from nonlinguistic mental faculties.  Research background  Researchers have found a very consistent order in the acquisition of first-language structures by children, which has drawn interest from Second Language Acquisition (SLA) scholars. Considerable effort has been devoted to testing the \\"identity hypothesis\\", which asserts that first and second language acquisitions may conform to similar patterns. This, however, has not been confirmed, perhaps because second-language learners' cognition and affect states are more developed. The two may have common neurological bases, but no convincing scientific evidence supports this hypothesis. There is research to suggest that most SLA learners begin their learning process with a silent period in which the learners begin to process pieces of the language they hear. This is considered a period of \\"language shock\\", in which they ignore some of the incomprehensible input of the new language. However, research has shown that many \\"silent learners\\" are engaging in private speech, sometimes called \\"self- talk\\". While appearing silent, they are rehearsing important survival phrases (lexical chunks). These memorized phrases are soon used in various situations, either by choice or necessity. Fewer learners have no silent period and pass directly into patterned speech. This speech is used to accomplish basic communication, often showing few departures from detached words strung together, which in time leads to more fluid phrases. Grammar of the target language is also simplified and the learners begin to construct an understanding of the second language, often attempting \\"sentences\\" that mix words or phrases from both their first and second languages. Harvard. N.B.Seidner.1982. pp 9–10 The nature of the transition between formulaic and simplified speech has been disputed. Some researchers, including Stephen Krashen, have argued that there is no cognitive relationship between the two and that the transition is abrupt. Thinkers influenced by recent theories of the lexicon prefer to view native speech as heavily formulaic. They interpret the transition as a process of gradually developing a broader repertory of survival phrases (chunks) with a deeper understanding of the rules which govern them. Some studies have supported both views. It is likely that the process depends in great part on the individual styles of the learners. A flurry of studies took place in the 1970s examining whether a consistent order of morpheme acquisition could be shown. A majority of these studies showed fairly consistent orders of acquisition for selected morphemes. For example: Among English, as additional language learners of English, the cluster of features, including the suffix \\"-ing\\", the plural form, and the linguistic copula were found to consistently precede others, i.e.; the grammar article, auxiliary verb, and third person singular form (Citation needed, date: November 2010). However, studies were widely criticized, as insufficient attention was given to the overuse of these features. More recent scholarship prefers to view the acquisition of each linguistic feature as a gradual and complex process. In this case there were idiosyncratic uses considered outside the obligatory contexts in the L2 and sporadic, but inconsistent use of the features. For that reason most scholarship since the 1980s has focused on the sequence rather than the order of feature acquisition. Sequence of acquisition A study of natural order of morpheme acquisition was done by Roger Brown. His research has shown that there appears to be a fixed pattern of morpheme development in first language acquisition.R. Brown 1973. Followed by studies that showed similar patterns for L2 acquisition, the view that the order of morpheme acquisition of English is consistent and relatively independent of the L1 has been dominant ever since, but recent studies have expressed results that challenge this view, and maintain that the morpheme acquisition order is at least partly L1-dependent. A number of studies have looked into the sequence of acquisition of pronouns by learners of various Indo-European languages. These are reviewed by Ellis (1994), pp. 96–99. They show that learners begin by omitting pronouns or using them indiscriminately: for example, using \\"I\\" to refer to all agents. Learners then acquire a single pronoun feature, often person, followed by number and eventually by gender. Little evidence of interference from the learner's first language has been found; it appears that learners use pronouns based entirely on their inferences about target language structure. Studies on the acquisition of word order in German have shown that most learners begin with a word order based on their native language. This indicates that certain aspects of interlanguage syntax are influenced by the learners' first language, although others are not. Research on the sequence of acquisition of words is exhaustively reviewed by Nation (2001). Kasper and Rose have thoroughly researched the sequence of acquisition of pragmatic features.. In both fields, consistent patterns have emerged and have been the object of considerable theorizing.

Prior to the summit, Secretary General Rasmussen personally prepared a draft of the plan. Rasmussen said the goal of the new Strategic Concept \\"must reconfirm Nato's core task – territorial defence – but modernise how we do it, including cyber defence and missile defence.\\" A group of experts led by former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright drafted a report to help prepare the plan. At meetings prior to the summit, officials said that the plan was \\"98% there\\" and that any additional disagreements would be addressed at the summit. The draft acknowledged that modern threats to the alliance's members come in non-traditional forms such as terrorism, possessing weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks that could disrupt power infrastructure. During the first day of the summit on Friday 19 November, the member states agreed to the new Strategic Concept that will serve as the alliance's mission plan for the next 10 years. The document addressed the importance of evolving threats to international security, and reemphasized the alliance's commitment to cooperation with prospective members and Russia. The 11-page document is titled \\"Active Engagement, Modern Defence\\". Afghanistan President of the United States Barack Obama meeting with President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai. President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai addressed the summit on Saturday 20 November. Karzai had said that he wants NATO to return control of the country by the end of 2014. Before the summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron said that the \\"NATO Summit in Lisbon is set to mark the starting point for passing responsibility for security progressively to Afghan forces.\\" While meeting with Karzai, the members agreed to a gradual phase-out of combat operations until 2014. After that date, NATO states would continue to contribute to training and advising the Afghan National Army. Secretary- General Rasmussen said \\"we will launch the process by which the Afghan government will take leadership for security throughout the country, district by district.\\" Though the members set the 2014 target date, many have already stated that their withdrawals will take place outside of any NATO decision. Russia Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, American President Barack Obama, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy on the summit's second day. In October 2010, Rasmussen announced that Russian President Dimitry Medvedev would be present at the summit. Medvedev agreed to attend after meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The summit then held the first meeting of the NATO-Russia Council since it was created in 2002. Relations between Russia and the alliance had been strained following the 2008 South Ossetia war, when Russia supported and recognized the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia. Prior to the summit, an article in The Economist noted that Russia may be more willing to cooperate on NATO issues and may pledge to contribute troops to Afghanistan. At the meeting, Russia agreed to cooperate on a missile defense programme that NATO sought to develop. Russia also committed to further support NATO's operations in Afghanistan by permitting more supplies to be transported through Russia and providing Mil Mi-17 helicopters to Afghan forces. Missile defense On the first day of the summit, leaders agreed to establish a missile defense system that would have the capability of covering all member states in Europe, as well as the United States and Canada. The proposed system had previously been a point of debate between NATO and Russia, but Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who attended the summit, indicated more willingness to cooperate with the alliance on the issue.

Operated by the same family since it opened in 1946, it has long been regarded as one of New Orleans' best restaurants, known for dishes such as Oysters Mosca, crab salad, and Chicken a la Grande. History Provino Mosca, an Italian immigrant, and his wife Lisa, had a restaurant in Chicago Heights, Illinois before they moved to New Orleans in 1946, after their daughter, Mary, married a Louisiana oysterman, Vincent Marconi. They opened Mosca's in Avondale, a remote area on the West Bank of the Mississippi River, in a building owned by New Orleans crime family boss Carlos Marcello, who became a regular customer of the restaurant. Marcello's son still owns the restaurant building. (It is also sometimes reported that Provino Mosca had been a chef for Al Capone in Chicago, but the family says this is untrue.) Provino died in 1962. Lisa (by then known as \\"Mama Mosca\\"), two of their children, Johnny and Mary, and Mary's husband Vincent took over the restaurant. \\"Mama Mosca\\" died in 1979 and Vincent died in 2004. The restaurant was damaged in Hurricane Katrina but reopened in 2006, repaired and with a larger, air-conditioned kitchen, but otherwise mostly unchanged. Johnny mostly retired after the hurricane, but Johnny's wife Mary Jo Angelotti, who took over as chef after Mary retired, continues to operate the restaurant with other family members, including Johnny (until his death in 2011) and Mary Jo's daughter Lisa. Mosca's received an America's Classics award from the James Beard Foundation in 1999. Location and cuisine Mosca's is known for its out-of-the-way location, a seventeen-mile drive on U.S. Highway 90 from the Crescent City Connection bridge, and its ramshackle exterior, as well as for its distinctive Italian Creole food. Writing in the 1970s, pioneer New Orleans food writers Richard and Rima Collin described the restaurant as \\"a white shack on the left in almost total isolation\\" and rated it as one of New Orleans' \\"Best of the Best\\", calling it \\"a joyous place with no airs whatsoever, bubbling over with the noise of serious eating on a massive scale\\" and a \\"New Orleans institution\\". They described the food's heritage as deriving from \\"the middle of Italy, the Romagna-Lazio region, rich in seafood.\\" (According to the restaurant's website, Provino Mosca came from San Benedetto del Tronto, a coastal city on the Adriatic Sea in the Marche region of central Italy.) In her New Orleans food memoir Gumbo Tales, Sara Roahen says, \\"Mosca's is just the sort of family-run restaurant that New Orleanians tend to covet: it's creaky, set in its ways, and no picnic to find.\\" In an edition of Roadfood written after Hurricane Katrina, Jane and Michael Stern comment that the restaurant seems unchanged since its reopening. They ask the rhetorical question, \\"can this two-room joint with the blaring jukebox really be the most famous Creole roadhouse in America?\\"; then they describe the experience as a \\"culinary epiphany\\", and say that \\"roadside food gets no better, or more garlicky, or heartier, than this.\\" Calvin Trillin, in a November 2010 article about the restaurant in The New Yorker, also remarks on its seemingly unchanged nature since 1946. He recounts that the Mosca family had once considered moving the restaurant to a more convenient location, but the idea had met substantial resistance from their mostly local customer base. Reviews of the restaurant often note that almost every party orders more or less the same items from Mosca's relatively short menu, served family-style in very large portions. These popular dishes include: *Oysters Mosca (also called Oysters Italian Style), which the Sterns call \\"a festival of garlic, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs\\"). *Shrimp Mosca (also called Shrimp Italian Style), summarized by local food critic Tom Fitzmorris as \\"enormous, whole, unpeeled, with olive oil and tons of garlic\\". *Marinated crab, served as a salad or in the shell. *Chicken a la Grande, a simple dish cooked in a skillet with (in Trillin's words) \\"only salt and pepper, rosemary, oregano, white wine, and, of course, ten cloves (or is it heads?) of garlic\\". *Spaghetti bordelaise, described by the Collins as \\"perfect homemade pasta and a remarkable, perfectly balanced oil and garlic sauce\\", and which Roahen calls \\"as much butter, oil, and garlic as your body can process without suffering a systematic failure.\\" *Pineapple fluff for dessert, which the Collins called \\"a bit of delicious New Orleans kitsch.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Marti Buckley Kilpatrick, \\"Mosca's: Cucina on the Bayou\\", Edible New Orleans, Summer 2010.

AYP History From 2010 through 2012, Blue Ridge High School achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) statususing safe harbor provisions.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Blue Ridge High School AYP Overview 2011, September 29, 2011 From 2003 to 2009, Blue Ridge High School achieved AYP status each school year. ;PSSA Results: Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology 1. The exams are given at the end of the applicable course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. ;11th Grade Reading: *2012 - 68% on grade level, (11% below basic).

Science in Motion Blue Ridge High School did not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Wilkes University provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region. College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 17% of Blue Ridge High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Blue Ridge High School offers the Pennsylvania Dual Enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. In 2010, the district received a $19,363 state grant to be used to assist students with tuition, fees and books. SAT Scores In 2014, 41 Blue RIdge School District students took the SAT exams.

Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Blue Ridge High School did not apply for funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08, Blue Ridge School District received $151,622. For the 2008-09, school year the district received $45,413 for a total of $197,035. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards.

The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Wellness policy Blue Ridge School Board established a district-wide Wellness Policy in 2005. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Blue Ridge HIgh School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Blue Ridge High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health’s extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Extracurriculars The Blue Ridge School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policies, in compliance with PIAA rules. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full- credit subjects to participate in sports. At Blue Ridge, students must maintain an overall GPA of 77 and may be failing no more than one core class.Blue Ridge School Board, Blue Ridge High School Handbook 2015-16 School Attendance and Conduct Requirements for Participation in Athletics and Extra- curricular Activities page 23, 2015 In 2012, the Blue Ridge High School Envirothon Team won the county-wide Envirothon contest.

The state's water is primarily drawn from the Floridan Aquifer as well as from the St. Johns River, the Suwannee River, and the Ocklawaha River. Florida's regional water conflicts stem primarily from the fact that the majority of the fresh water supply is found in the rural north, while the bulk of the population, and therefore water consumption, resides in the south. Metropolitan municipalities in central and south Florida have neared their aquifer extraction limit of per day, leading to the search for new, extra- regional sources.  North-South Water Conflict = Background  In 2003, a committee predominantly composed of real estate developers was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to solve Florida's water disparity. Members were selected from the lobby group Council of 100 and in a 2003 report proposed \\"a system that enables water distribution from water-rich areas to water-poor areas,\\" or the transfer of water through pipelines from the state's northern regions to its more developed and drier southern cities. The Suwannee river region was declared by committee member Lee Arnold to be \\"sitting in the Saudi Arabia of water.\\" Representatives, citizens, and groups, such as the Florida Wildlife Federation, across the state argued that Governor Bush curb development in the south as opposed to further contributing to the water imbalance and restricting municipal water use even more. Half the state's fresh water is consumed by South Florida, which includes Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County as well as the majority of the state's agricultural land, golf courses, and swimming pools. Legally, water in Florida is owned by the state, with five water management districts overseeing its regional use and distribution. State law allows the transfer of water from one region to another, but it stipulates this action as a region's last resort.  Resolution  The Council's report offered an incentive for northern regions to transfer water south, suggesting that excess supply may be sold for profit. However, Floridians responded with slogans such as \\"Our water is not for sale!\\" Ultimately, more than 30 of the state's counties passed resolutions against the proposal, citing various concerns including overpopulation, uncontrolled development, sink holes, spring depletion, and saliniznation of groundwater supplies. As a result of the public's negative reaction towards the water-transfer proposal, Governor Bush rejected the Council's report. Instead, millions of dollars have been allocated to water development projects. The South Florida Water Management District plans to restore parts of the Everglades to ensure a continual water supply for its region.  Tampa Bay Conflict  The Tampa Bay water war is a conflict between Hillsborough County, Pasco County, Pinellas County, New Port Richey, St. Petersburg, and Tampa that has been going on since the 1970s over water supply. The Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) is another key player. Created in 1961, it is a district in charge of over 16 counties; it has the responsibility to meet the water needs of all water users while additionally handling water resources efficiently. The West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority was created to handle the water efficiently.  History  By the early 1990s, the Tampa Bay area had failed to effectively collaborate on sharing their water resources. Eleven regional groundwater facilities serve nearly 90% of the water demand for the Tampa Bay Area. By legislative acts, Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties were required to work together collectively on a regional water system that would be more effective for using their water in a more environmentally safe and productive way. The group that was formed is West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority. Conflict arose over pumping rights as seen with Pinellas County continuing to purchase wells in Pasco County, and therefore using water before Pasco County inhabitants used their County's water. This also displayed the issue that water was owned traditionally by the land owners and permission was needed to use ground and surface water from the areas. Landowners were having major problems with the new sharing of sources and caused new litigation problems. A solution was made in 1991 when Pasco County was awarded the right to use their water first while allowing Pinellas County unlimited access to two well fields. Pinellas County continued to cause conflict by refusing to fund alternative water sources and prevented the development of such innovations. This caused further litigation between West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority and Southwest Florida Water Management District from 1994 to 1998 that resulted in zero progress for development in alternatives. The current Tampa Bay Water company cites in its history that the main reason behind zero development within the WCRWSA was that its members were unequally in control of water facilities, thus causing no unification on who was developing alternatives. With the combined problems of property impacts cited by homeowners, Pinellas County funded a campaign to advertise that the water scarcity issues were from drought not overpumping of aquifers, which was suspected of them. The solution to these litigation battles was the Florida Legislature demanding restructuring of the institutions at play and West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority became Tampa Bay Water by the Northern Tampa Bay New Water Supply and Ground Water Withdrawal Reduction Agreement in 1997. They would receive funding from the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) in order to research and develop new water sourcing alternatives.  Tampa Bay Today  The regions today are receiving water from three sources: ground water, desalinated seawater and river water. The three sources from the configuration plan made in 1998 were supposed to meet the Tampa Bay's needs until 2012. Their water sources include Alafia River, Hillsborough River, Tampa Bypass Canal, and Tampa Bay Seawater Desalination Plant. Tampa Bay Seawater Desalination Plant was originally issued for building in 1997, but after many delays in construction as well as performance failures, it was not fully functioning until 2007. It is currently providing a day.  Future Plans  Tampa Bay Water has put together plans that are being explored from 2009 to 2013. Here is a list of some of the plans for the future: * Gulf Coast Seawater Desalination Plant - an additional desalination plant is a possibility that has the potential to provide 9 million to per day. * Northern Tampa Bay Wellfields - This would increase the availability and allowance of using wellfields as a source of water. * Small Footprint Reverse Osmosis in Pinellas County - Requires monitoring reverse osmosis and desalination techniques used in Tarpon Springs and Oldsmar. If the cities do not continue with their plans, Tampa Bay Water would consider using it for regional plans. * Surface and Recharge Water Projects – Entails using additional water from Alafia River and Bullfrog Creek, reviewing additional surface water storage and possibly using reclaimed water. * Tampa Bay Seawater Desalination Plant Expansion - Involves increasing the plant by a day. * Thonotosassa Wells - Plans to research and evaluate whether this is an additional plausible source for future water needs.  Current conflicts  Although the counties are now successfully united under Tampa Bay Water, within the last year there have still been reported water shortages. The region's water supplies have dipped dangerously low and newer stricter precautions have been forced onto citizens for using water. Even with the plans for future water sources, it seems that with the growing population in the region and increasingly dry seasons, water scarcity is still a pressing issue.  Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) Water War = Background  Map of the ACF WatershedThe three rivers involved are part of the ACF River Basin which stretches from northern Georgia down to Eastern Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The Chattahoochee River is fed mostly from surface water and has its origins in Georgia near Atlanta. It flows southwesterly crossing over the Alabama border and then merging with the Flint River near the Florida border to form the Apalachicola River. The Flint River also has its origins near Atlanta and heads southward but is fed by groundwater and has a lower flow than the Chattahoochee. The water from the Flint river is used mostly for agricultural purposes, while the water from the Chattahoochee is used mostly for municipal purposes. Florida depends on the freshwater of the Apalachicola River to mix with the salt water of the Gulf of Mexico in Apalachicola Bay. The $70 million oyster industry in Florida is concentrated in Apalachicola Bay and is very sensitive to salinity levels in the bay.  Conflict  The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) water war originated in the 1980s over a water rights dispute between Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. In 1986, Georgia suffered from a drought that lowered the levels of the Chattahoochee River and Lake Lanier to dangerously low levels, so low that the dam was not able to produce enough electricity for nearby Atlanta. As a result, in 1989, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposed a 50% increase in water withdrawal from the river to provide fresh water to Atlanta's growing population. Out of fear that the river would not be able to maintain such use, Alabama filed a suit against the USACE in 1990 because they had not assessed the environmental effects of this proposal. Both Alabama and Florida were concerned about the proposal's effect on water quantity and quality downstream. Both states believed the flow would slow to a point that would damage their ability to provide hydroelectricity and maintain growth. They also believed freshwater withdrawal would increase the flow from pollution from upstream, which was a serious problem for Florida especially because of the oyster industry. By the end of the year, Florida had joined the suit, and the ACF water war became a tri-state conflict. In order to stay the suit, the federal government proposed the ACF Comprehensive Water Resources Study to analyze fully the effects of the proposed withdrawal and to assess the needs of the basin as a whole. Although the USACE originally claimed they had enough information initially, it took an additional eight years to complete the study.  Resolution Attempts  In 1992, the three states decided to remove the dispute from the legal courtroom until the USACE study was completed. In the meantime, water withdrawal levels were frozen and any changes had to be approved by all three states. When the study was completed in 1997, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida created a bill called the Apalachicola- Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin Compact, which was introduced to each state legislature and to the United States Congress. The ACF Compact allowed each state to review the USACE study and then come to an agreement about water allocation by December 31, 1998. The bill was ratified by all three state legislatures and by the U.S. Congress later that year. Because of the gubernatorial elections in all three states in 1998, they decided to extend the deadline to December 31, 1999, and because of an issue with the Alabamian governor, the deadline was extended yet again to May 1, 2000. At this point Florida was becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress and with the fact that Georgia would simply not agree to any minimum flow restrictions. The deadline was extended once more to August 1, 2000. Between 1999 and 2003, the deadline was extended 14 times, at which point, Florida dropped out of the negotiations because Georgia refused to compromise. In 2003, the USACE gave Georgia the rights to a quarter of the water in Lake Lanier for drinking water, and Alabama and Florida objected. After a series of lawsuits between 2003 and 2008 and a record drought in 2007, Georgia's rights to the water in Lake Lanier were denied, stating that the change required congressional approval. After several attempts at appeal, it seems Georgia has lost the fight for water rights, but a negotiation has yet to be made. The three states have until 2012 to make a final compromise.

It is headquartered in the county seat of Sylva. The Jackson County School system is unique in the way that is still has a K–8 system with combined elementary and middle schools, with one central high school and one combined K–12 elementary/middle/high school. The county school system has eight schools, all with different histories and stories behind why they are the way they are today. The school system includes four kindergarten- through-8th-grade schools, two kindergarten-through-12th-grade schools, one traditional 9th-through-12th-grade high school, and one alternative 9th- through-12th-grade high school early college. History The first school in the Jackson County area opened in 1830 near Cullowhee. A small, one-roomed structure, it set in place the basic formula for all schools in the area for the next 56 years. Small one-roomed schools dotted the landscape until the first high school opened in 1886 in Hamburgh (now Glenville). In 1889, Cullowhee High School opened and the school later turned into Western Carolina University. The first public high school opened in Webster in 1910, and Sylva followed suit in 1912. Graded Schools, some with multiple floors, classrooms, and even Auditoriums and Gyms were built of wood in many areas, including Sylva, Webster, Dillsboro, Glenville, Tuckasegee and Qualla (near Whittier) in the early 1900s. In the 1920s, the school district changed with the addition of multiple bigger consolidated graded Elementary and high schools. The largest high school was in Sylva, and it was built for $65,000 in 1924. Cullowhee School was built in 1923, followed by Sylva High School (1924), Colored Consolidated School (1924), Johns Creek (1925), East LaPorte (1925), Glenville (1926), Qualla (1927), Cowarts (1928), and Sylva Elementary (1929). During the great depression in the 1930s, the WPA helped build several schools. Webster Rock School (1936), Cashiers School (1938), McKee Training School (Cullowhee, 1939), Balsam School (1940) and Savannah Elementary School (1940) were several such projects. In the 1940s, several schools that had deteriorated badly were renovated or replaced. Tuckaseigee School was built after a fire destroyed the original wooden structure in 1948, Barkers Creek School, which also served as a church and was a one-roomed school, was condemned in 1947, and Sylva Elementary School was condemned and had to be gutted and renovated in 1948. In the 1950s, the last one and two teacher schools and wooden graded schools closed and Log Cabin Associated Consolidated Elementary School (Dillsboro, 1950) (consolidated Wilmont, Dicks Creek, and Barkers Creek Schools), Scotts Creek School (Sylva, 1951) (Consolidated Willets, Balsam, Addie, and Beta Schools), and Canada Consolidated School (Little Canada, 1951) (Consolidated Charleys Creek, Wolf Mountain, Rock Bridge, and Tanasee Gap Schools), replaced them. At this time several older county schools got facelifts, renovations, and additions, and the relatively new Tuckaseigee and Balsam Schools closed. In 1960, Sylva-Webster High School opened at what is now the Smoky Mountain High School campus, Colored Consolidated School got a new building, and Camp Laboratory School opened in 1964. At this time Sylva High School, Webster High School, McKee Training School, and Johns Creek School closed. Not long after it opened, Colored Consolidated was closed in 1965 in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1973 Fairview Elementary School opened behind Sylva-Webster High School in Sylva, consolidating Sylva Elementary School (1929/1948), Webster Elementary School (1936), and Savannah Elementary School (1940/1955). In 1975, Blue Ridge School opened in Cashiers, consolidating Glenville Elementary School (1926), Glenville High School (1926/1951), and Cashiers Elementary School (1938/1951). In 1980, Smokey Mountain Elementary School opened in Whittier near the old Qualla School, closing Qualla School (1927) and Log Cabin School (1950). In 1988, the biggest change since the 1960s to the high schools happened- Cullowhee High School was consolidated with Sylva-Webster High School at the old Sylva Webster Campus from 1960 and the new school was Smoky Mountain High School. A new two-story building was added to the Smoky Mountain High School campus the following year, to alleviate overcrowding. The Camp Laboratory School in Cullowhee remained active as a K-8 School for another six years until the new Cullowhee Valley School came online in 1994. In 2001, Scotts Creek Elementary School received a new building, and in 2002 the former building became the HUB/School Of Alternatives. In 2004–2006, Smoky Mountain High School received several renovations and additions to the gym and main building. In 2008, Jackson County Early College opened at the Southwestern Community College Campus in Webster on NC 116, and in 2010 they received their own building. At about the same time, Blue Ridge School, which opened in 1975, divided into two parts, each with its own principal. Kindergarten through 6th Grade is now considered Blue Ridge Elementary School, and 7th through 12th grade is now considered Blue Ridge Virtual Early College High School.

In September 2019, more than thirty years after the last graduating class at Sylva-Webster, the first annual Sylva-Webster Fest was held at Bridge Park in Sylva. This event culminated when the older classes formed a committee regarding the interest in having a class-wide reunion. From there, bloomed one of the best class reunion ever imagined and over 500 in attendance from the combined classes.

It was there that he received his PhD in music theory and composition and was appointed director of the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society in 2016. In 2014, Kern was appointed president of the League of Composers / International Society for Contemporary Music, the oldest organization for contemporary music in the United States, founded and based in New York City in 1923. On July 24, 2018, Kern made his Mostly Mozart Festival debut with members of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra. On July 25, 2018, Kern presented a late night recital, performing alongside pianist Emanuel Ax and Philipp Marguerre. Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that Kern showcased \\"the wonders of the modern glass harmonica\\" at that concert. Earlier that evening, the \\"splendid soloists\\" performed Mozart's Adagio & Rondo with two glass harmonicas and ensemble at David Geffen Hall for second evening in a row, an event critic Meche Kroop described as an \\"extraordinary state of shock, a pleasant shock.\\" Kern also made guest appearances during this time, appearing on Niklas Liepe's 2018 album, \\"The New Paganini Project\\". Kern premiered his arrangement of Mozart's Adagio and Rondo for glass harmonica, flute, oboe, viola and cello with leading members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and the Calidore String Quartet in May 2019. He appeared with the same arrangement in Amsterdam in June 2019 with members of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in a joint concert with Pierre-Laurent Aimard. In January 2020, Kern performed the American premiere of Johann Friedrich Reichardt's \\"Rondeau for Glass Harmonica and Strings\\" with the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. The Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb presented the first Croatian production of Gaetano Donizetti's original version of Lucia di Lammermoor with Glass Harmonica in February 2020, with Kern as soloist. His first performance in Paris on March 13, 2020 at the Cité de la Musique was held without audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic but was recorded for broadcast by Radio France.

The World Wireless System was a turn of the 20th century proposed telecommunications and electrical power delivery system designed by inventor Nikola Tesla based on his theories of using Earth and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for \\"the transmission of electric energy without wires\\" on a global scale.\\" as well as point-to-point wireless telecommunications and broadcasting. He made public statements citing two related methods to accomplish this from the mid-1890s on. By the end of 1900 he had convinced banker J. P. Morgan to finance construction of a wireless station (eventually sited at Wardenclyffe) based on his ideas intended to transmit messages across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. His decision to change the design to include wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's new radio based telegraph system was met with Morgan's refusal to fund the changes. The project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational. During this period Tesla filed numerous patents associated with the basic functions of his system, including transformer design, transmission methods, tuning circuits, and methods of signaling. He also described a plan to have some thirty Wardenclyffe-style telecommunications stations positioned around the world to be tied into existing telephone and telegraph systems. He would continue to elaborate to the press and in his writings for the next few decades on the system's capabilities and how it was superior to radio-based systems. Despite claims of having \\"carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission\\",Electrocraft. Volume 6. 1910, p. 389 there is no documentation he ever transmitted power beyond relatively short distances and modern scientific opinion is generally that his wireless power scheme would not have worked.

Tesla sits in front of a spiral coil from a high-voltage transformer at his East Houston St., New York laboratory in 1896 Origins Tesla's ideas for a World Wireless system grew out of experiments beginning in the early 1890s after learning of Hertz's experiments with electromagnetic waves using induction coil transformers and spark gaps.James O'Neill, Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla, p. 86Marc Seifer, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla. p. 1721 He duplicated those experiments and then went on to improve Hertz's wireless transmitter, developing various alternator apparatus and his own high tension transformer, known as the Tesla coil.\\"Nikola Tesla\\". ieeeghn.org, Tesla, Nikola, \\"Alternating Electric Current Generator\\".

While a single terminal incandescent lamp connected to one of an induction coil’s secondary terminals does not form a closed circuit \\"in the ordinary acceptance of the term\\"Martin, Thomas Commerford, \\"The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla\\", The Electrical Engineer, New York, 1894; \\"On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena,\\" February 24, 1893, before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, March 1893, before the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis. the circuit is closed in the sense that a return path is established back to the secondary by capacitive coupling or 'displacement current'. This is due to the lamp’s filament or refractory button capacitance relative to the coil’s free terminal and environment; the free terminal also has capacitance relative to the lamp and environment. =Wireless transmission= The second result demonstrated how energy can be made to go through space without any connecting wires. The wireless energy transmission effect involves the creation of an electric field between two metal plates, each being connected to one terminal of an induction coil’s secondary winding. A gas discharge tube was used as a means of detecting the presence of the transmitted energy. Some demonstrations involved lighting of two partially evacuated tubes in an alternating electrostatic field while held in the hand of the experimenter.Martin, Thomas Commerford, \\"The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla\\", The Electrical Engineer, New York, 1894; \\"Experiments With Alternating Currents of Very High Frequency, and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination,\\" AIEE, Columbia College, N.Y., May 20, 1891. Development Drawing from the 1897 \\"Apparatus for Transmission of Electrical Energy\\" (along with ), shows Tesla's concept of transmitting electrical energy through the upper atmosphere via terminals supported by balloons tethered at up to 35,000 feet above sea level. While formulating his theories in the early 1890s Tesla discarded the idea of using radio waves.earlyradiohistory.us, Thomas H. White, Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T \\"Invent Radio\\", November 1, 2012 He did not necessarily believe that radio waves existed as theorized by Maxwell,Nikola Tesla, The Problem of Increasing Human Energy, June 1, 1900 and he agreed with what most physicists were saying at the time: that radio waves would travel in a straight line in the same way that visible light travels, limiting their use for long-range communication.Brian Regal, Radio: The Life Story of a Technology, p. 22 (Radio waves do travel in a straight line, but this was many years before the discovery that the ionosphere would reflect certain radio waves making skywave communication of shortwave frequency bands possible over long distances.) He believed that transmitting electrical signals beyond a line-of-sight distance would require the use of planet Earth as a conducting medium to overcome this limitation. By the end of 1895, he made statements to the press about the possibility that \\"Earth's electrical charge can be disturbed, and thereby electrical waves can be efficiently transmitted to any distance without the use of cables or wires\\", and that the electrical waves can be used to transmit \\"intelligible signals\\" and \\"motive power.\\"\\"Tesla on Electricity Without Wires,\\" Electrical Engineer N.Y., Jan 8, 1896, p. 52. (Refers to letter by Tesla in the New York Herald, 12/31/1895.) On April 11, 1896, he stated that \\"messages might be conducted to all parts of the globe simultaneously\\" using electric waves \\"propagated through the atmosphere and even the ether beyond.\\"Mining & Scientific Press, \\"Electrical Progress\\" Nikola Tesla Is Credited With Statement\\", April 11, 1896 In September 1897 he applied for a patentU.S. Patents number 645,576 and 649,621 on a wireless power transmission scheme consisting of transmitting power between two tethered balloons maintained at 30,000 feet, an altitude where he thought a conductive layer should exist.Carol Dommermuth-Costa, Nikola Tesla: A Spark of Genius, Twenty- First Century Books, 1994, pp. 85–86 Between 1895 and 1898, he constructed a large resonance transformer in his New York City lab called a magnifying transmitter to test his earth conduction theories.My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, Hart Brothers, 1982, Ch. 5, In 1899 he carried out large scale experiments at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Based on his measurements there, he concluded that the Earth was \\"literally alive with electrical vibrations.\\" He noted that lightning strikes indicate that the Earth is a large conductor with waves of energy traveling around it. He constructed a large magnifying transmitter measuring in diameter which could develop a working potential estimated at 3.5 million to 4 million volts and was capable of producing electrical discharges exceeding in length.Nikola Tesla: Guided Weapons & Computer Technology, Leland I. Anderson, 21st Century Books, 1998, pp. 12–13, . With it he tested earth conduction and lit incandescent electric lamps adjacent to his lab in demonstrations of wireless power transmission. In Colorado Springs, a Tesla coil receiver tuned in resonance with a Tesla coil transmitter illuminates a 10-watt incandescent lamp. The distance from the transmitter's ground plate to the point of reception is . Upon returning to New York City from Colorado Springs in 1900 he sought venture capitalists to fund what he viewed as a revolutionary wireless communication and electric power delivery system using the Earth as the conductor. By the end of 1900 he had gained the attention of financier J. P. Morgan who agreed to fund a pilot project (later to become the Wardenclyffe project) which, based on his theories, would be capable of transmitting messages, telephony, and even facsimile images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. Morgan was to receive a controlling share in the company as well as half of all the patent income. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's radio based telegraph system.Marc J. Seifer, Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard, from: ExtraOrdinary Technology (Volume 4, Issue 1; Jan/Feb/Mar 2006) Morgan refused to fund the changes and, when no additional investment capital became available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational. Construction of the Wardenclyffe \\"wireless plant\\" in Shoreham started towards the end of 1901 and continued for the next three years. The plant included a Stanford White–designed brick building, a wood- framed tower tall with a in diameter \\"cupola\\" on top, and a shaft sunk into the ground with sixteen iron pipes driven \\"one length after another\\" below the shaft in order for the machine, in Tesla's words, \\"to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver\\".Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power, , p. 203Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, Barnes & Noble Publishing. 1999, p. 100 Funding problems continued to plague Wardenclyffe and by 1905-1906 most of the site's activity had to be shut down. Elements Tesla's basic patent drawing for the grounded resonance transformer used at Wardenclyffe Through the latter part of the 1890s and during the construction of Wardenclyffe, Tesla applied for patents covering the many elements that would make up his wireless system. The system he came up with was based on electrical conduction with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and as well as through a theorized conducting layer in the atmosphere.W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press. 2013, p. 210Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, Barnes & Noble Publishing. 1999, p. 106 The design consisted of a grounded Tesla coil as a resonance transformer transmitter that he thought would be able to create a displacement of Earth's electric charge by alternately charging and discharging the oscillator's elevated terminal. This would work in conjunction with a second Tesla coil used in receive mode at a distant location, also with a grounded helical resonator and an elevated terminal.Seifer, Marc J., Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla. p. 228.Tesla, Nikola, \\"The True Wireless\\". Electrical Experimenter, May 1919. (Available at pbs.org) He believed that the placement of a grounded resonance transformer at another point on the Earth's surface in the role of a receiver tuned to the same frequency as the transmitter would allow electric current to flow through the Earth between the two. He also believed waves of electric current from the sending tower could be made to reflect back from the far side of the globe, resulting in amplified stationary waves of electric current that could be utilized at any point on the globe, localizing power delivery directly to the receiving station. Another aspect of his system was electricity returned via \\"an equivalent electric displacement\\"\\"Ratzlaff, John T., Tesla Said, Tesla Book Company, 1984; \\"The Disturbing Influence of Solar Radiation On the Wireless Transmission of Energy,\\" Electrical Review and Western Electrician, July 6, 1912 in the atmosphere via a charged conductive upper layer that he thought existed, a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless transmission- reception system developed by Mahlon Loomis.Thomas H. White, Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T \\"Invent Radio\\",earlyradiohistory.us, November 2012 The current was thought to be usable at the receiver for telecommunications, and to drive electrical devices.Ratzlaff, John T., Dr. Nikola Tesla Complete Patents; System of Transmission of Electrical Energy, September 2, 1897, , March 20, 1900. Tesla told a friend his plans included the building of more than thirty transmission-reception stations near major population centers around the world,Seifer, Marc J., Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla. p. 472. (cf. \\"Each tower could act as a sender or a receiver. In a letter to Katherine Johnson, he explains the need for well over thirty such towers\\".) with Wardenclyffe being the first. If plans had moved forward without interruption, the Long Island prototype would have been followed by a second plant built in the British Isles, perhaps on the west coast of Scotland near Glasgow. Each of these facilities was to include a large magnifying transmitter of a design loosely based on the apparatus assembled at the Colorado Springs experimental station in 1899.Nikola Tesla On His Work with Alternating Currents and Their Application to wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power, 21st Century Books, 2002, p. 170. Claimed applications 1925 artist's conception of what Tesla's wireless power transmission system might have looked like in the future, powering aircraft and lighting the city in the background. Tesla's description of his wireless transmission ideas in 1895 includes its humanitarian uses in bringing abundant electrical energy to remote underdeveloped parts of the world, as well as fostering closer communications amongst nations.Nikola Tesla, \\"Letter: Electricity Without Wires\\", New York Herald, 01/01/1896 In his June, 1900 Century Magazine article \\"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\\", he elaborated on the properties of the Earth and on the principles of a system which could use the Earth as the medium for communication and the transmission of power without wires. He wrote that communications at any distance was practicable. He also noted this same process could be used to locate maritime objects such as icebergs or ships at sea and that \\"electrical movement of such magnitude\\" could communicate with other planets. In 1909 Tesla stated: :\\"It will soon be possible, for instance, for a business man in New York to dictate instructions and have them appear instantly in type in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up from his desk and talk with any telephone subscriber in the world. It will only be necessary to carry an inexpensive instrument not bigger than a watch, which will enable its bearer to hear anywhere on sea or land for distances of thousands of miles. One may listen or transmit speech or song to the uttermost parts of the world.\\"Gilbert King, The Rise and Fall of Nikola Tesla and his Tower, smithsonian.com, February 4, 2013Wireless of the Future, Popular Mechanics Oct 1909 He also believed that high potential electric current flowing through the upper atmosphere could make it glow, providing night time lighting for transoceanic shipping lanes. He elaborated on World Wireless in his 1919 Electrical Experimenter article titled \\"The True Wireless\\", detailing its ability for long range telecommunications and putting forward his view that the prevailing theory of radio wave propagation was inaccurate.Gregory Malanowski, The Race for Wireless, AuthorHouse. 2011, p. 36 :\\"The Hertz wave theory of wireless transmission may be kept up for a while, but I do not hesitate to say that in a short time it will be recognized as one of the most remarkable and inexplicable aberrations of the scientific mind which has ever been recorded in history.\\" Feasibility Tesla's demonstrations of wireless power transmission at Colorado Springs consisted of lighting incandescent electric lamps positioned nearby the structure housing his large experimental magnifying transmitter,, recorded in \\"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\\" article published in Century Magazine, June 1900 with ranges out to from the transmitter. There is little direct evidence of his having transmitted power beyond these photographically documented demonstrations.2 Jan, 1899, ‘‘Nikola Tesla Colorado Springs Notes 1899–1900’’, Nolit, 1978, p. 353. He would claim afterwards that he had \\"carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission\\". He believed that he had achieved Earth electrical resonance that, according to his theory, would produce electrical effects at any terrestrial distance.W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press. 2013, p. 301 There have been varied claims over the years regarding Tesla's accomplishments with his wireless system. His own notes from Colorado Springs are unclear as to whether he was ever successful at long-range transmission. Tesla made a claim in a 1916 statement to attorney Drury W. Cooper that in 1899, he collected quantitative transmission-reception data at a distance of about .Cooper, Drury W., internal document of the law firm Kerr, Page & Cooper, New York City, 1916. (Cited in } Tesla biographer John J.

Green homes focus on the efficient use of \\"energy, water, and building materials\\". A green home may utilize sustainably sourced, environmentally friendly, and/or recycled building materials. It may include sustainable energy sources such as solar or geothermal, and be sited to take maximum advantage of natural features such as sunlight and tree cover to improve energy efficiency. Elements No government standards define what constitutes a green remodel, beyond non- profit certification. In general, a green home is a house that is built or remodeled in order to conserve \\"energy or water; improve indoor air quality; use sustainable, recycled or used materials; and produce less waste in the process.\\" This may include buying more energy-efficient appliances or employing building materials that are more efficient in managing temperature. History= United States  In the United States, the green building movement began in the 1970s, after the price of oil began to increase sharply. In response, researchers began to look into more energy efficient systems. Many organizations were founded in the 1990s to promote green buildings. Some organizations worked to improve consumer knowledge so that they could have more green homes. The International Code Council and the National Association of Home Builders began working in 2006 to create a \\"voluntary green home building standard\\". The Energy Policy Act was enacted in 2005, which allowed tax reductions for homeowners who could show the use of energy efficient changes to their homes, such as solar panels and other solar-powered devices. Certifications Various types of certifications certify a home as a green home. The U.S. Green Building Council is an example of an organization that gives out green home certifications. Its certification is titled as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. The factors that it considers include \\"the site location, use of energy and water, incorporation of healthier building and insulation materials, recycling, use of renewable energy, and protection of natural resources\\". The US National Association of Home Builders independently created its Model Green Home Building Guidelines as a type of certification, along with programs for utilities. The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), part of the Confederation of Indian Industry was formed in the year 2001. The council offers a wide array of services that include developing new green building rating programmes, certification services and green building training programmes.

A German commerce raider encountered a British auxiliary cruiser and sank her with heavy losses after an hour of fighting. Background The Kriegsmarine auxiliary cruiser was raiding in the mid Atlantic in early 1941. On that cruise, the Germans engaged two other British armed merchant cruisers (HMS Alcantara and HMS Carnavon Castle) in surface battles but they ended indecisively. So when Thor encountered Voltaire, her crew were already battle tested and anxious to sink an enemy combatant. Thor was long and weighed , she was armed with six , two and four naval guns along with four torpedo tubes. The raider also carried an Arado Ar 196A-1 floatplane for reconnaissance and had a complement of 349 officers and crewmen. HMS Voltaire was larger than the raider—displacing —but with a smaller crew of 269 men and officers. She had eight and two naval guns, including at least one anti-aircraft mount. Thor was returning to Germany when she found Voltaire heading to Freetown about southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Action It was about 06:15 on 4 April when crewmen of Thor spotted smoke on the horizon. Captain Otto Kähler assumed the vessel to be a coal burning ship so he altered course into the direction of the smoke. When the Germans were able to make visual contact with HMS Voltaire, they suspected she was a neutral ocean liner as she did not attempt to escape. The British—under Captain J.A. Blackburn—sighted the approaching Germans coming head on, so they fired a burst of anti-aircraft fire as signal for identification. A signal from Thor was not returned, but the British soon discovered the identity of the approaching ship at about 06:45, when it replaced the flag of Greece with a German naval ensign and fired a shot across Voltaires bow. The British responded by manning their guns and firing a broadside with their mixed armament, but to no avail; they were outgunned and outranged. After only four minutes of dueling at around away, the Germans began striking Voltaire with their guns. The first shots entered the radio room and the generator room of Voltaire, heavily damaging the vessel, knocking out communications and steering gear and putting her into a list. Heavy fires also broke out and nearly covered the entire deck of the British ship. Despite the fire the Royal Navy gunners continued fighting for nearly an hour. For the next several minutes, the two sides fired; only one British shot managed to hit Thor, and it caused no casualties, the shot tearing off some radio equipment attached to the main mast. By 07:15, only two of the British guns were in action, while Thor circled around Voltaire, firing rapidly. At 08:00, the German's guns overheated so Captain Kähler decided on a torpedo attack to end the engagement. But just as Thor was lining up to fire a spread, a white flag was observed aboard Voltaire and so the firing ceased. Captain Blackburn—having lost 72 men killed in action—gave the order to abandon ship and for the next five hours the Germans rescued 197 survivors, two of whom died later on and the rest became prisoners of war. Kähler also recorded that half of the rescued sailors were wounded. After the battle, Thor continued on to Germany to refit for a second raiding voyage. She had fired 724 rounds in a 55-minute battle, more than 50 percent of her ammunition.

It is a remake of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 film Straw Dogs, itself based on the Gordon Williams novel The Siege of Trencher's Farm. It stars James Marsden and Kate Bosworth. Plot Scriptwriter David Sumner and his wife Amy relocate to rural Mississippi where Amy grew up. They are going to live in the house of Amy's recently deceased father and to allow David to finish a script. While in town one afternoon, David meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie and his three friends, Norman, Chris, and Bic. David is intimidated by the men, but they have already been hired to fix the roof of the barn on Amy's property. He also meets Tom Heddon, a former high school football coach whose 15-year-old daughter Janice is attracted to a local man with an intellectual disability, Jeremy Niles. Heddon often bullies Jeremy and believes that he is stalking his daughter. Charlie and his friends arrive early the next morning to work on the roof. They taunt David, which later escalates into harassment. They also make crude remarks towards Amy and play loud music to distract David while he writes. They often leave early when they want to go hunting, which concerns David because it is taking them forever to finish the roof. One Sunday after church, Heddon attacks Jeremy for talking to Janice, and Amy comes to his defense, but David warns her to not get involved. Later that night back at home, David discovers their cat strangled and hung up in the bedroom closet. Amy is positive that Charlie and his friends are to blame as they disappeared from the church barbeque for a few hours earlier, but David is hesitant to confront them. When he does finally question them, the men deny everything. Charlie invites David to go deer hunting. While David is out in the woods with two of the men, Charlie goes back to the house and pushes his way inside to confront Amy and also have sex with her, because he thinks that she still wants him. He throws her onto the couch and rapes her. Afterwards, he realizes that he raped Amy, and that she did not want this, and is stunned. Norman arrives, holds Amy across the top of the couch, and rapes her while Charlie watches. They then leave. When David returns, Amy doesn't tell him what happened. Instead, she encourages David to fire Charlie and his men. The next day David tells Charlie that fixing the roof is taking too long. Charlie insists that they have already paid for the roofing supplies, which David agrees to pay for. Finally, Charlie and his crew leave, celebrating their $5,000 payday. David and Amy go to a local football game. Cheerleader Janice lures Jeremy to enter an empty locker room. Heddon notices that his daughter is missing from the game and goes in search of her. Meanwhile, Janice tries to convince Jeremy to let her give him oral sex. They hear Heddon calling for Janice. Afraid of Heddon finding them, Jeremy holds Janice tight against his body with his hand over her mouth and nose, accidentally smothering her to death. Horrified, he runs away from the school. Heddon goes back to tell Charlie and his friends that Janice is missing. They all suspect that Jeremy has done something to her. At the game, Amy has haunting flashbacks about the rapes and asks David to take her home. On the way, she tells him that she wants to return to Los Angeles, surprising him and causing him to accidentally run over Jeremy who is standing in the road. David and Amy take him back to their home and call an ambulance. Charlie and Norman overhear the ambulance call on a police scanner and inform Heddon. They all drive to David and Amy's house and demand that the couple hand Jeremy over, but David refuses. The sheriff arrives shortly thereafter and tries to calm down the situation. He knocks on the door and tells David to open the door, but David still refuses. Heddon picks up his gun again and shoots the sheriff dead. Having witnessed the murder, David knows now that the men will try to kill not only Jeremy but both of them too. David and Amy barricade the doors shut. He enlists her to help him open the jaws of a decorative bear trap. Then he sends Amy upstairs with Jeremy. David looks frantically for something he can use in the house to fight off the men. When Chris attempts to enter through a window, David nails his hands to the wall with a nail gun, his throat fatally exposed to broken glass. When Heddon tries to follow, David burns his face with hot oil. Heddon and Charlie use the pick-up truck to ram into the house, but Charlie is knocked unconscious. David fights Heddon off and causes him to shoot himself in the foot. David then shoots Heddon and beats Bic to death with a fireplace poker. Upstairs, Amy and Jeremy are attacked by Norman, who has climbed in through the window. Norman is attempting to rape Amy again when David and Charlie appear. Charlie and Norman draw on each other when Norman threatens to kill Amy. Amy shoots Norman, Charlie assaults and disarms her, then David jumps him. Charlie kicks David down the stairs and beats him severely. While David lies prostrate on the floor, disarmed, Charlie prepares to shoot him in his head when Amy approaches from behind, pointing the gun at him. Turning to her, Charlie informs her the gun is empty, and says to her, \\"I will always protect you, baby,\\" when David rises behind him and slams the open bear trap down on his head, which shuts and ensnares him. Charlie slowly dies. While Amy, at first, is horrified at the scene, she later takes solace knowing both her rapists are dead. As sirens are heard, with the adjacent barn in flames, David says, \\"I got 'em all.” CastProduction The film was originally scheduled for release on February 25, 2011. However the date was pushed to September 16, 2011. The film began shooting on August 16, 2009 in Shreveport and Vivian, Louisiana. Release=Box office Straw Dogs opened on September 16, 2011 with $1,980,000 for the day and took $5.1 million in its opening weekend. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews; Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 42% based on reviews from 126 critics, with the consensus \\"This remake streamlines the plot but ultimately makes a fatal mistake: It celebrates violence\\". Metacritic gives the film a score of 45% based on 29 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars stating that Straw Dogs \\"almost succeeds as an object lesson in the difference between being a man and being a macho animal. But it fails as a gripping home- invasion thriller\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called the film \\"a bird-brained remake\\" that is \\"miscast, barely functional in terms of technique, stupid and unnecessary\\" and rated it 1 out of 4 stars. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe, wrote that watching Straw Dogs was like \\"being waterboarded by liberals outside a Democratic National Committee event\\". Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times had reviewed the original version back in 1971. He gave the 2011 film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, and states \\"This new version of \\"Straw Dogs\\" is a reasonably close adaptation of the 1971 film by Sam Peckinpah. Change the location from England to Mississippi, change a mathematician into a screenwriter, keep the bear trap and the cat found strangled, and it tells the same story. It is every bit as violent. I found it visceral, disturbing and well-made\\", and said he preferred it to the original. Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News was also favorable towards the film, giving it 4 out of 5 stars, declaring that \\"while Lurie could have gone lighter on the symbolism, he ratchets up the tension with deft intelligence. He's not just making a thriller but a horror film, and we feel his own fear in every scene\\".

He is currently the Bren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).  Education  Hajimiri received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University. He has also worked for Bell Laboratories, Philips Semiconductors, and Sun Microsystems. As a part of his Ph.D. thesis, he developed a time-varying phase noise model for electrical oscillators, also known as the Hajimiri phase noise model.  Career  In 2002, he cofounded Axiom Microdevices Inc. together with his former students Ichiro Aoki and Scott Kee based on their invention of the Distributed Active Transformer (DAT), which made it possible to integrate RF CMOS power amplifiers suitable for cellular phones in CMOS technology. Axiom shipped hundreds of millions of units before it was acquired by Skyworks Solutions in 2009. He and his students also demonstrated the world's first radar-on-a-chip in silicon technology in 2004, showing a 24-GHz 8-element phased array receiver and a 4-element phased array transmitter in CMOS. These were followed by a 77-GHz phased array transceiver (transmitter and receiver) with on chip antennas that established the highest level of integration in mm-wave frequency applications and was a complete radar-on-a-chip. They also developed a fully scalable phased array architecture in 2008, making it possible to realize very-large- scale phased arrays. He and his team are also responsible for the development of an all-silicon THz imager system, where an integrated CMOS microchip was used in conjunction with a second silicon microchip to form an active THz imaging system, capable of seeing through opaque objects. They demonstrated various phased array transmitters around 0.3THz with beam steering using the distributed active radiator (DAR) architecture in 2011. Various applications of this system appear in security, communications, medical diagnostics, and the human-machine interface. In 2013, he and some of his team members demonstrated a complete self-healing power amplifier, which through an integrated self-healing strategy, could recover from various kinds of degradation and damage including aging, local failure, and intentional laser blasts. Between 2014 and 2018, his lab demonstrated several major advances in imaging, projection, and sensing technology on silicon photonic platforms. In 2014, they showed the first silicon nanophotonic optical phased array transmitter capable of dynamic and real-time image projection, therefore serving as a lensless projector. In 2015, he and his group constructed a 3D coherent camera via a silicon nanophotonic coherent imager (NCI) that performed direct 3D imaging at meter range with a 15-micron depth resolution. In 2016, they devised and implemented a one-dimensional (1D) integrated optical phased array receiver which could image a barcode directly from the surface of a chip, followed in 2017 by an integrated two-dimensional (2D) optical phased array receiver capable of imaging simple 2D patterns without a lens using a very thin optical synthetic aperture of a few microns, thereby demonstrating a lensless flat camera for the first time. In 2018, they demonstrated the world's first all-integrated optical gyroscope, whose principle of operation is based on the Sagnac effect. He and his team have also developed systems and technologies for wireless power transfer at a distance. In 2017, he co-founded GuRu Wireless (formerly Auspion, Inc.), which commercializes wireless power transfer technology for consumers.  Awards  Hajimiri is a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI). He was selected to the world's top 35 innovators under 35 (TR35) at age 32. He is an IEEE Fellow and has been the recipient of numerous other awards. He was recognized as one of the top 10 authors in the 60-year history of ISSCC in 2013. He holds more than 100 granted U.S. patents. He was one of 45 scientists invited to speak at the World Economic Forum in 2016. As of 2019, roughly half of his graduated PhD students have gone on to become university faculty members. Hajimiri has also won a number of prizes as an educator, such as the Richard P. Feynman Prize for Excellence in Teaching, Caltech's most prestigious teaching award, as well as awards from Caltech's undergraduate and graduate student councils. His online lectures on YouTube are a popular source of continued education worldwide.

These missions flanked the entirety of the Spanish colonies, which extend from Mexico and southwestern portions of current-day United States to Argentina and Chile. The relationship between the Spanish Colonization and the Catholicization of the Americas is inextricable. The conversion of the region was crucial for the colonization of it. The missions that were built by members of Catholic orders were often created on the outermost borders of the colonies. This construction facilitated the expansion of the Spanish empire through the religious conversions of the indigenous peoples occupying those areas. While the Spanish Crown dominated the political, economic, and social realms of the Americas and those indigenous to the region, the Catholic Church dominated the religious and spiritual realm. Similar to the way that colonization requires destruction of what existed before in order to construct something new, the Catholicization of the Americas actively destroyed indigenous spiritualities. The Church and its clergy replaced indigenous gods, goddesses, and temples with Catholic churches and cathedrals, saints, and other practices. Quite often, indigenous peoples honored Catholic religious symbols in conjunction with symbols of their own spiritualities. One such example is Our Lady of Guadalupe, who is an image of the Virgin Mary, and is associated with the Aztec goddess Tonantzin. The evangelization of Catholicism was motivated by many conjoining desires and rationalizations. The Spanish Crown was interested in the spread of the Spanish Empire, and viewed the spread of the Catholic Church as a primary means to colonize the land and the indigenous people on it. The Catholic Church as an institution was interested in redeeming the souls of the indigenous Americans. They believed that they were given the divine right and responsibility of Christianizing as many parts of the world as possible. Missionaries themselves were motivated by the desire to construct the Americas as the site of pure Christianity, as a departure from European Christianity. Many religious clergy had become critical of the increasingly corrupt papacy in Europe, demanding excessive tribute and accepting monetary indulgences for redemption. Many clergy ventured to the Americas so they could preach what they felt was a purer form of Christianity, and to redeem the souls of the indigenous peoples. This paternalist viewpoint excused much of the violence and abuse experienced by the indigenous Americans at the hands of the colonizers, political elite and religious clergy alike. To restate, the role of the Catholic Church is incredibly significant in the Spanish Colonization of the Americas. Despite extensive efforts in recovering the cultural history of indigenous cultures, much of the evidence currently available comes from the colonizers themselves and the missionaries, more specifically. Many of the cultures impacted by missionaries had no written language and were thus robbed of much of their oral history when the populations were decimated by Old World illnesses. Cultures that indeed possessed written languages, such as the Maya, often had their artifacts deemed sacrilegious and burned. Therefore, much of the history of Christian missions comes from accounts of missionaries and—to a much lesser extent archaeological investigation, and should be handled with care. Readers should consider the ethnocentric and theocratic context in which missionaries presented their accounts.  Beginnings of evangelization = Patronato Real  The Patronato Real, or Royal Patronage, was a series of papal bills constructed in the 15th and early 16th Century that set the secular relationship between the Spanish Crown and the Catholic Church, effectively pronouncing the Spanish King’s control over the Church in the Americas. It clarified the Crown’s responsibility to promote the conversion of the indigenous Americans to Catholicism, as well as total authority over the Church, educational, and charitable institutions. It authorized the Crown’s control over the Church’s tithe income, the tax levied on agricultural production and livestock, and the sustenance of the ecclesiastical hierarchies, physical facilities, and activities. It provided the Crown with the right to approve or veto Papel dispatches to the Americas, to ensure their adherence to the Patronato Real. It determined the founding of churches, convents, hospitals, and schools, as well as the appointment and payment of secular clergy. It is clear that the Patronato Real provided the Spanish Crown with an unprecedented level of authority over the Catholic Church. It demonstrates the intricate relationship the political expansion of the colonies had with Catholicism. As these bulls were discussed and granted prior to and in the early stages of Spanish Colonization, it is clear that the Catholic Church operated in the interests of the Spanish Crown from the start. The expansion of Catholic missions around the Americas afforded the Crown an increasing income from the levied taxes and control over tithe income. That economic interest—along with the Crown’s control over the Church’s educational and charitable institutions, which directly interacted with and deeply influenced a large swath of the indigenous populations they were colonizing—provided an argument for the Crown’s interest in incorporating the Catholic Church into their colonization of the Americas.  Parish expansion  To promote conversions, the Catholic Missionaries in the Americas received Royal approval to create provinces, or parishes. These parishes echoed the structures of European towns—created with the explicit intention of converting the indigenous peoples who constructed and lived in them. These territories were separate from the jurisdictions of the Crown, with separate laws and structures. The papacy sent multiple religious orders to set up towns in areas along the borderlands to prevent a single order from becoming too powerful. First the Franciscans set up parishes, then the Dominicans, Augustinians, and Jesuits followed. These orders are discussed in more detail later on in this article. To begin the process of constructing a new parish, the priests entered an indigenous village and first converted the leaders and nobles, called caciques. These conversions were often public. Once the caciques were converted, the clergy collaborated with the elites to construct a chapel, often atop the destroyed temple for the indigenous spirituality. This chapel played a role in bringing the rest of the people of the town to the Church. The Franciscans in particular wanted an indigenous priesthood, and built schools to teach indigenous elite about humanistic studies. The clergy were most interested in converting the souls of the indigenous, by any means possible. Therefore, in many instances, the clergy used indigenous religions to gain trust and legitimacy. In fact, many members of the clergy learned indigenous languages so they could be more accessible and understandable to those wanted to convert. They even selected indigenous languages to be used as linga franca in areas that had linguistic diversity. In New Spain, which is modern-day Mexico and Central America, the friars taught Nahuatl to indigenous Americans who had not spoken it prior, as a way of establishing a common language. They translated hymns, prayers, and religious texts into Nahuatl to make Catholicism more widely spread and understood. The clergy in Peru used Quechua and Aymara in similar ways. Early into the existence of the community, the European clergy formed a cofradía, which is a lay brotherhood meant to raise funds to construct and support the parish church, provide aid to the poor, aged, or infirmed and to widows and orphans, and to organize religious processions and festivals for Catholic holidays. That said, the creation of the parish also depended on the labor of the recently converted indigenous people to build schools, offices, houses, and other infrastructure for economic production. This need for labor led to conflict with the encomenderos, who were charged by the Crown with the exclusive task of exploiting indigenous labor.  Parish economy  The Catholic orders profited tremendously from the expansion of the parishes and from the conversion of the indigenous peoples, along with the exploitation of their labor. The Jesuits, among other orders, became extremely wealthy as a result. The Jesuits gained landholdings in the 17thcentury, becoming prominent property owners throughout the colonies. Unlike other methods used for property accumulation, like land seizure or royal grant, the Jesuits gained property from purchase and donation. The Jesuits also amassed wealth from tithes and clerical fees, as well as from profits made from the production of agricultural and other commercial products. The Jesuits, along with the other religious orders, fully participated in and profited off of the internal trade economy of the Americas. Therefore, the religious orders that had vowed themselves to poverty had become some of the wealthiest institutions in the Americas. All of this production was at the expense of the indigenous who were converted and colonized, as it was the indigenous people who completed the labor-based tasks. As we can see, the spread of Catholicism was highly profitable to the Catholic Church.  Paternalist protection  Much of the expressed goals of the spread of Catholicism was to bring salvation to the souls of the indigenous peoples. The Church and the Crown alike viewed the role and presence of the Church in the Americas as a buffer against the corrupt encomenderos and other European settlers. The Church and its clergy were meant to be advocates for the interests of the indigenous, as well as to provide them with social services. To do this, the indigenous parishes had different laws, different economies, different government styles, all with the intention of keeping them separate, and protected from the European society. The indigenous Americans were consideredby the Crown and the Church to be legal minors, so much of the motivation for this paternalism comes from the desire of the Church to protect their “children” from the harsh and corrupt Europeans. It is important here to point out an irony within this ideology and practice. While the Church and its clergy had the intention of protecting the indigenous peoples, it was also successfully exploiting their labor, profiting off of the production.  Spanish colonialism = Practices  Catholic missions were installed throughout the Americas in an effort to integrate native populations as part of the European culture; from the point of view of the Spanish Kings, naturals of America were seen as Crown subjects in need of care, instruction and protection from the military and adventurers, most of them in the pursuit of gold, silver, land and nobility titles. The missionaries goal was to convert natives to Christianity, because diffusion of Christianity was deemed to be a requirement of the religion. Spanish Vice- royalties in America had the same structure as the Vice-Royalties in Spanish provinces. The Catholic church depended on the Kings administratively, but in doctrine was subjected, as always, to Rome. Spain had a long battle with the Moors, and Catholicism was an important factor unifying the Spaniards against the Muslims. Further, the religious practices of American natives alarmed the Spanish, so they banned and prosecuted those practices. The role of missionaries was primarily to replace indigenous religions with Christianity, which facilitated integration of the native populations into the Spanish colonial societies. One symbolic example of this was the practice of constructing churches and cathedrals, such as Santa Domingo and Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, on top of demolished native temples. Establishment of missions was often followed by the implementation of Encomienda systems by the Vice-royal authorities, which forced native labor onto land granted to Europeans by the Spanish Crown and led to oppression.  Missionaries  Pedro de Gante was a European missionary who desired assimilation of Native American communities to further educational discourse amongst indigenous communities. He was so influential in his work, he became known as \\"The first teacher of the Americas\\".L. Campos. Gante, Pedro De. Detroit: Gale, 2007, 89. Originally, Peeter Van der Moere, Pedro de Gante, came to New Spain, in 1523 also known as Mexico. A missionary, Pedro de Gante, wanted to spread the Christian faith to his native brothers and sisters. During this time, the mentality of the Spanish people proscribed empowering the indigenous people with knowledge, because they believed that would motivate them to retaliate against the Spanish rulers. Nevertheless, Pedro de Gante saw the ritualistic practices of the indigenous, which traditionally involved human sacrifices (specially from enemy tribes), and as a missionary, saw the need for a change in faith. He decided the best approach was to adapt to their way of life. He learned their language and participated in their conversations and games.Lipp, Solomon. Lessons Learned from Pedro de Gante. American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. Hispania, 1947, 194. Despite having a stutter, he was a successful translator of Nahuatl and Spanish. Additionally, Pedro de Gante was a big advocate of education of the youth, where he established schools throughout Mexico to cater to the indigenous communities.The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Pedro de Gante. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 1998. His influence spanned so wide, others like him followed by example. Of the future missionaries to come to America, at least three of his compatriots came.Proano, Agustin Moreno. The Influence of Pedro de Gante on South American Culture. Artes de Mexico: Margarita de Orellana, 1972. Fray Pedro de Gante Pedro de Gante living quarters before expedition.  Native revolts  In addition to the encomienda system, the aggressive implementation of missions and their forcible establishment of reductions and congregations led to resistance and sometimes revolt in the native populations being colonized. Many natives agreed to join the reductions and congregations out of fear, but many were initially still allowed to quietly continue some of their religious practices. However, as treatment of natives grew worse and suppression of native customs increased, so did the resistance of the natives. The most notable example of rebellion against colonization is the Pueblo Revolt in 1680, in which the Zuni, Hopi, as well as Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres-speaking Pueblos took control of Santa Fe and drove the Spanish colonial presence out of New Mexico with heavy casualties on the Spanish side, including 21 of the 33 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. The region remained autonomous under native control despite multiple non-violent attempts at peace treaties and trade agreements until 1692. The Tepehuan Revolt was likewise stirred by hostilities against the missionaries, which arose due to the concurrent and explosive rise in disease that accompanied their arrival. The Tepehuan associated the rise in death directly with these missionaries and their reductions, which spread disease and facilitated exploitative labor to encomanderos and miners. The revolt lasted from 1616 to 1620 with heavy casualties on both sides. During the conflict, the Spanish abandoned their policy of \\"peace by purchase (tribute)\\" in favor of \\"war of fire and blood.\\"  Epidemics in missions  With resistance and revolts, the native population dropped drastically with the introduction of Spanish missions. However, the main factor for the overwhelming losses were due to epidemics in the missions. Despite being affected before the introduction of missions, the buildings allowed rodents to infiltrate living areas and spread disease more rapidly. Some of the most common diseases were typhus, measles and smallpox.Wade, Lizzie. \\"New Mexico's American Indian population crashed 100 years after Europeans arrived.\\" ScienceMag, 25 Jan. 2016, https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/new-mexicos- american-indian-population-crashed-100-years-after-europeans-arrived. Accessed 14 Jan. 2020. Many natives were living in cramped spaces with poor hygiene and poor nutrition. This led not only to high mortality rate, but to low fertility rates as well. In specific areas where natives were dispersed in various regions, friars created new villages to divide the natives from Europeans and simultaneously systemize their teachings.Burkholder, Mark A., and Lyman L. Johnson. Colonial Latin America. 9th ed., Oxford University Press, 2014. Colonial Latin America. pg. 106 It is estimated that every 20 years or so, a new epidemic wiped out the adult population of natives in many missions, giving no chance for recovery.Newson, Linda. \\"The Demographic Impact of Colonization.\\" The Cambridge Economic History of Latin America. Vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2005. It is imperative, at this moment, to illustrate the loss of life in the Native population by using the example of the small province known as Jemez in New Mexico. Scientists say that upon the arrival of the Spanish missionaries in 1541, approximately 5,000 to 8,000 natives lived in Jemez. Through examination of plants within the village, scientists were able to determine the age gap of plant life to better understand the loss of human interaction with vegetation. By 1680, scientists concluded that the Jemez village was populated by approximately 850 natives. This 87% decrease in population size illustrates the tragic effects of diseases of the time, combined with the introduction of a new culture influenced by the Spanish missionaries.  Cultural changes  In converting natives, missionaries had to find various ways of implementing sacramental practices among them. Some sacraments, like Baptism, were already similar to the Nahuatl rituals during birth, usually performed by a midwife. Many missionaries even allowed for natives to keep some aspects of their original ritual in place, like giving the child or newborn a small arrowhead or broom to represent their future roles in society, as long as it complied with Catholic beliefs. Other sacraments, like Matrimony, were fairly different from native practices. Many natives were polygamous. To perform the sacrament of marriage, Franciscan friars had a husband bring his many wives to the church, and had each state her reasons for being the one true wife. The friars then decided who was the wife, and performed the sacrament.Reilly, Penelope. The Monk and the Mariposa: Franciscan Acculturation in Mexico 1520–1550(2016). In addition to religious changes, Spanish missionaries also brought about secular changes. With each generation of natives, there was a gradual shift in what they ate, wore and how the economy within the missions worked. Therefore, the younger generation of natives were the most imperative in the eyes of the Spanish mission. The missionaries began educating the native youth by separating the children from their families and placing them in Christian-based schooling systems. To reach their audience, the Spanish missionaries devoted much time to learning the native culture. This cultural shift can best be seen in the very first trilingual dictionary dating back to 1540 in Mexico. This book that was uncovered took the printed version of author Antonio Nebrija’s dictionary titled Grammar and Dictionary (focused on spanish and latin translations), and added handwritten translations of Nahuatl language within the document. Although the author of these edits is unknown, it is a tangible example of how Spanish missionaries began the process of catholic transformation in Native territories.\\"Christianizing the Nahua.\\" The Aztecs and the Making of Colonial Mexico, https://publications.newberry.org/aztecs/section_3_home.html. Accessed 14 Jan. 2020. Missionaries introduced adobe style houses for nomadic natives and domesticated animals for meat rather than wild game. The Spanish colonists also brought more foods and plants from Europe and South American to regions that initially had no contact with nations there. Natives began to dress in European-style clothing and adopted the Spanish language, often morphing it with Nahuatl and other native languages.Jackson, Robert H., and Edward D. Castillo. Indians, Franciscans, and Spanish Colonization : The Impact of the Mission System on California Indians. 1st ed. Albuquerque: U of New Mexico, 1995.  Catholic orders = Franciscan  Franciscan missionaries were the first to arrive in New Spain, in 1523, following the Cortes expeditions in Mexico, and soon after began establishing missions across the continents. The Franciscan missionaries were split evenly and sent to Mexico, Tezcoco, Tlaxcala, and Tezcoco. In addition to their primary goal of spreading Christianity, the missionaries studied the native languages, taught children to read and write, and taught adults trades such as carpentry and ceramics. By 1532, approximately 5,000 native children were educated by the Franciscan missionaries in newly built monasteries spread throughout central Mexico. Many of these children resided in cities such as Cholula, Tlalmanalco, Tezcuco, Huejotzingo, Tepeaca, Cuahutitlan, Tula, Cuernavaca, Coyoacán, Tlaxcala and Acapistla. Pedro De Gante was recorded to have the largest class of approximately 600 natives in Mexico City. The first missionaries to arrive in the New World were Franciscan friars from the observant faction, which believed in a strict and limited practice of religion. Because the friars believed teaching and practicing can only be done through \\"meditation and contemplation,\\" Franciscans were not able to convert as many people as quickly as the Spanish wanted. This caused strain between colonial governments and Franciscan friars, which eventually led to several friars fleeing to present day western Mexico and the dissolution of Franciscan parishes. Other issues also contributed to the dissolution of Franciscan parishes, including the vow of poverty and accusations from colonial governments. However, Spanish missions often used money from the King to fund missions. Having friars taking money was controversial within the church. In addition, the colonial government claimed missionaries were mistreating indigenous people working on the missions. On the other hand, the Franciscan missionaries claimed that the Spanish government enslaved and mistreated indigenous people. Present day efforts are to show where Franciscan missionaries protected the indigenous people from Spanish cruelties and supported empowering the native peoples.  Jesuits  The Jesuits had a wide-spread impact between their arrival in the New World about 1570 until their expulsion in 1767. The Jesuits, especially in the southeastern part of South America, followed a widespread Spanish practice of creating settlements called \\"reductions\\" to concentrate the widespread native populations in order to better rule, Christianize, and protect the native populace.Caraman, Philip (1976), The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America, New York: Seabury Press. The Jesuit Reductions were socialist societies in which each family had a house and field, and individuals were clothed and fed in return for work. Additionally, the communities included schools, churches, and hospitals, and native leaders and governing councils overseen by two Jesuit missionaries in each reduction. Like the Franciscans, the Jesuit missionaries learned the local languages and trained the adults in European methods of construction, manufacturing, and, to a certain extent, agriculture. By 1732, there were thirty villages populated by approximately 140,000 Indians located from Northern Mexico down to Paraguay.Burkholder, Mark A., and Lyman L. Johnson. Colonial Latin America. 9th ed., Oxford University Press, 2014. Colonial Latin America. pg. 109 Spanish settlers were prohibited from living or working in reductions. This led to a strained relationship between Jesuit missionaries and the Spanish because in surrounding Spanish settlements people were not guaranteed food, shelter, and clothing. Another major Jesuit effort was that of Eusebio Kino S.J., in the region then known as the Pimería Alta – modern-day Sonora in Mexico and southern Arizona in the United States.  Dominicans  The Dominicans were centralized in the Caribbean and Mexico and, despite a much smaller representation in the Americas, had one of the most notable histories of native rights activism. Bartolomé de las Casas was the first Dominican bishop in Mexico and played a pivotal role in dismantling the practice of \\"encomenderos\\",these laws were intended to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas by the encomenderos, by strictly limiting their power and dominion over groups of natives, with the establishment of the New Laws in 1542.

A double album, III/IV was recorded prior to bassist Catherine Popper's departure, and also marks guitarist and backing vocalist Neal Casal's recording debut for the band. According to Adams, the album remained unreleased until 2010, as his former label, Lost Highway, had previously rejected it. According to producer and keyboardist Jamie Candiloro, the album's title stems from \\"the idea that Cold Roses [is] volumes one and two, and this was a logical step that the Cardinals had taken forward as a band effort. The tracks shared the democratic process of a band. It will always be an amazing look into the world of a great band during one of its most versatile line-ups.\\" Orders from the PAX AM online store also received a download card for 11 bonus demos from the album. The album peaked at #59 on the Billboard 200 chart in January 2011. It has sold over 47,000 copies. Background and recording In mid-2006, following a disagreement with his label, Lost Highway, Ryan Adams contacted producer Jamie Candiloro asking for assistance in recording new material.

Genesis of issue In December 2001, Mike Huebsch began leading efforts to block the funding for Witch's $32,500-a-year position. He stated taxpayers \\"shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus.\\" The legislators had learned that Wisconsin Department of Corrections had recently hired Rev. Jamyi Witch as a prison chaplain at the Waupun Correctional Institution in Waupun, Wisconsin. Witch, who had volunteered for two years as a chaplain and had an extensive knowledge of alternative religions, had competed against nine other candidates for the civil service position and was hired as the most qualified candidate for the $32,500 per year job.Toosi, Nahal, \\"Wiccan Rev.

Hiring controversy Huebsch and Walker objected publicly on the basis of her religion to the chaplain’s hiring, saying: \\"Witch's hiring raises both personal and political concerns.

He claimed that Witch met with him on a prior occasion to plan this hostage situation, though at the time the accuser claims the conspiracy took place, Witch was able to show she was not present due to medical leave. The State charged Witch with multiple criminal offenses, including sexual assault as the inmate claimed that she complied with performing a forced sexual act during the hostage situation.

It is sometimes called the KP, Bowen or Bowen special. It is Australia's most popular mango, accounting for over 80% of the country's annual commercial mango market. It is considered to have a distinctive flavour and aroma when compared with the Florida-bred cultivars grown by most mango-exporting countries. In Australia, commercial Kensington Pride mangoes grow predominantly in the Northern Territory and northern and central Queensland, providing early (September–November) and late season (December–February) mangoes respectively. Some late-season fruit are from the Kununurra region in Western Australia. Very few commercially available fruit come from south-east Queensland or northern New South Wales, and fruit from these latitudes is generally of lower quality.  History  The original tree emerged in Bowen, Queensland in the late 1880s (although the fruit was not formally described until the 1960s), where it was given the name \\"Pride of Bowen\\" and \\"Bowen Special\\". It was possibly brought to Bowen from India between 1885–1889 by traders who were shipping horses for military use in India. The polyembryonic nature of the fruit suggests a south east Asian origin, although the shape and colour are very similar to Indian cultivars suggesting a possible hybrid. Whatever the origin, one story states that a particular specimen was given to a Bowen Harbour and Customs Officer, GE Sandrock, who planted the seeds on his property. As the trees grew, Sandrock selected the seeds of the better fruits and passed them on to a Mr McDonald for his own plantings. From these plantings Mr Harry Lot, another local farmer, selected a particularly good variety and started his own small orchard on Adelaide Point, near Bowen. The resulting fruit was popular in the local markets and named after the original property: Kensington'. Other farmers acquired their own specimens and the fruit spread throughout the Bowen region. Kensington Pride was recognized for its flavor and became the most widely grown commercial mango in Australia, and remains so today despite the introduction of other varieties. It is grown widely in the tropical and sub- tropical regions of the country. Kensington Pride was also introduced to the United States via Florida, where it is sold on a limited-basis as nursery stock for home growing. Kensington trees are planted in the collections of the USDA's germplasm repository in Miami, Florida, the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead, Florida, and the Miami–Dade Fruit and Spice Park, also in Homestead.  Description  Display of Kensington Pride mangoes at the Tropical Agricultural Fiesta in the Fruit and Spice Park in Homestead, Florida. The fruit average around a 500 grams in weight at maturity. They are ovate in shape and have a rounded apex, generally lacking a beak. The skin color is yellow, developing some red blush. The flesh is yellow, with moderate fiber, and has a sweet and spicy flavor. The fruit contains a polyembryonic seed, meaning that two seedlings emerge from one seed.  Production  The fruit usually ripens from mid-September to March in Australia depending on the region it is grown, but has been known to ripen as early as August in the Northern Territory. They typically ripen in July in Florida, USA. Kensington fruit production is considered moderate and inconsistent in Australia, with fruit having moderate disease resistance. The cultivar is exceptionally erratic, with wide year-on-year variation in fruit output and quality. In Australia, the mango season spreads southward from September through February. The mango season begins near Darwin and Katherine late September and ends by early December. Queensland varieties (from such locations as Mareeba, Dimbulah, Townsville, Bowen and Yeppoon) enter the market around this time and persist on the market well into January. In the 1990s and 2000s, the number of mangoes coming from the Northern Territory has increased substantially. Trees are moderately vigorous growers and can reach heights over 8 metres (25 feet) if left unpruned.

Unlike many business organizations, sustainability organizations are not limited to implementing sustainability strategies which provide them with economic and cultural benefits attained through environmental responsibility. For sustainability organizations, sustainability can also be an end in itself without further justifications. Recently, the natural environment has become a key strategic issue in both the business and academic communities. Through \\"implementing sustainability strategies, firms can integrate long-run profitability with their efforts to protect the ecosystem, providing them with opportunities to achieve the traditional competitive advantages and cost leadership and market differentiation via environmental responsibility\\".

Sustainable agriculture systems are \\"designed to take the greatest advantage of current soil nutrient and water cycles, energy flows, beneficial soil organisms, and natural pest controls. These systems also seek to produce food that is nutritious yet uncontaminated with products such as synthetically compound fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, and livestock feed additives. Sustainable agriculture systems often depend on crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, off-farm organic wastes, appropriate mechanical cultivation or minimal tillage to optimize soil biological and natural pest control activity in order to maintain soil fertility and crop productivity.\\"Rod Macrae, , \\"Ecological Agriculture Projects\\", 1990 Also, resistant species varieties, and biological and cultural controls are implemented to control pests, weeds and diseases.

Her name in Greek translates to \\"Athenais the loving one\\". Life The child of King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his second marriage to the Anatolian Greek Macedonian noblewoman and Pontian Queen Monime, she was a princess of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. Born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontos, her parents gave her a traditional ancient Greek name. Athenais married the Cappadocian Prince and later King Ariobarzanes II Philopator, who was of Persian and Greek descent. Queen consort Ariobarzanes II succeeded his father as King in 63 BC-62 BC, when his father Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios abdicated his throne. When Ariobarzanes II became king, Athenais became Cappadocian queen, inheriting the honorific title of \\"Philostorgos\\", which was the honorific surname of the mother of Ariobarzanes II, Athenais Philostorgos I. Athenais was related to the previous kings and monarchs of Cappadocia. Her paternal aunt Laodice of Cappadocia was a queen, her paternal cousins, Ariarathes VI, Ariarathes VII, and Ariarathes VIII, and her paternal half-brother Ariarathes IX all served as previous kings of Cappadocia. Through her Seleucid and paternal lineage, Athenais was related to the ancestors of Ariarathes VI. Ariobarzanes II reigned as king of Cappadocia from c. 63 BC-62 BC until his assassination in c. 51 BC. There are various surviving honorific inscriptions dedicated to Athenais. During their marriage, Athenais bore Ariobarzanes II two sons: Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios and Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos. Her sons would serve as among the last kings of Cappadocia. The name \\"Ariobarzanes\\" was not only a name from her husband's family, but also a name from her own family. Athenais had three paternal political ancestors of that name: Ariobarzanes of Phrygia, who flourished 5th century BC, Ariobarzanes II of Cius, who flourished 4th century BC, and the previous Pontian King Ariobarzanes of Pontus. Queen mother After the death of her husband, her first son succeeded his father as King and she became a widow who never married again. Athenais became known as the ‘Queen-Mother’ of Cappadocia. During the rule of Ariobarzanes III, Roman Governor of Cilicia Marcus Tullius Cicero warned the King that Athenais could be a potential enemy to him. Cicero's warning was based on Athenais’ jealousy, about two nobles called Methras and Athenaeus. They were ministers and favorites of her first son and they were through Athenais’ jealousy were driven out from the Cappadocian Royal Court. However, Methras and Athenaeus were later recalled by Cicero. Athenais’ jealousy was a part of her failed plot to depose her first son from his throne and put her second son in his place. Cicero and Ariobarzanes III caught Athenais out and Ariobarzanes III was very saddened by his mother's actions. Ariabarzanes III removed his mother from power and her fate afterward is unknown.

Opened on 18 November 1981, it was constructed between 1973 and 1981; to move the line away from geologically unstable land; and also to replace the high-maintenance steel viaducts including the Mangaweka Viaduct. It is the most recent and most significant deviation of the NIMT since it was opened in 1909. History The original section of the line was constructed as part of the NIMT in 1904. The entirety of the route from Marton north to Taihape was built to the west of the Rangitikei River and lies predominantly on the terraces within the river valley. Only south of Marton does the NIMT cross the Rangitikei en route to Palmerston North and Wellington. Between the settlements of Mangaweka and Utiku the western river terrace is largely non-existent with steep hill country running into tall river cliffs. The topography is also compounded by the confluence of the Kawhatau River with the Rangitikei. However, despite these obstacles surveyors were able to identify a route that kept the line to the west of the river along the cliff tops; albeit one that included a climb at each end of the section, a viaduct, and several tunnels. By the 1960s concerns existed about the long-term stability of the land the section ran through. While the general Mangaweka area was susceptible to slips due to its steep hilly nature, rainfall and underlying geology of papa rock (mudstone), the railway, by virtue of its cliff top nature and several tunnels, was thought to be under particular threat from erosion and collapse. At the same time concerns were also being voiced over State Highway 1 as the steep, narrow and twisting alignment was also prone to slips – having been built after the railway in the same area though further to the west – and naturally imposed speed restrictions that were exacerbated by heavier vehicles and creating bottlenecks. As a result, investigations were commenced into improving both routes, including the feasibility of a joint rail-road alignment. Construction and new alignment From a number of options put forward different routes were chosen for SH1 and the NIMT, as it proved possible to reconstruct SH1 over much of the existing alignment. The SH1 works were completed in stages between 1972 and 1980. The NIMT route chosen was from one of the joint options given and was constructed between 1973 and 1981. The new alignment crossed the Rangitikei River twice and the Kawhatau River once - requiring the construction of three massive viaducts - and also removed the gradients at each end of the section. From the south, the deviation leaves the old alignment at exit of the Mangaweka tunnel, and crosses SH1 and passes much closer to the settlement than it did previously. It then passes under SH1 before crossing the South Rangitikei viaduct, which is a 78-m high, 315-m long triple-span structure. The line then runs along the eastern river terrace for about 2 km, firstly through a lengthy cutting and then across the Blind Gully embankment (New Zealand's largest) before crossing the Kawhatau (73-m high) and North Rangitikei (81-m high) viaducts in quick succession; the North Rangitikei viaduct is the highest on the NIMT. Both the Kawhatau and North Rangitikei viaducts have a 160-m long single centre span and two 25-m long approach spans, and are to a cantilever design so differ from the South Rangitikei Viaduct design. The line rejoins the original NIMT alignment a further 1 km north, just to the south of Utiku. The section was subsequently electrified as part of the NIMT electrification carried out between 1984 and 1988. The deviation was opened in 1981, after which the rails were lifted on the former alignment. The Mangaweka Viaduct had been built between November 1902 and November 1903, and was demolished in 1982. It was long and high; with eight major spans and several of . The former alignment today Much of the former alignment still exists today. For most travellers the most visible remnant of the old line are the bases of the Mangaweka viaduct which sit on the hillsides on each side of SH1 just north of the railway overpass. The formation can still be followed either side of where the viaduct stood, though to the south it is slowly being reclaimed by bush and the tunnel at the top of the climb has been almost totally blocked by a slip at the northern portal. North of the former viaduct the formation runs through farmland. The five tunnels on this side of the alignment remain largely intact. The former Mangaweka railway station closed in 1981, and the former Utiku railway station closed in 1986.

It was founded by Ma Qi in 1915. Composition and history The Ninghai Army was made up of Hui Muslims. The name \\"Ninghai\\", was applied to the armies of the Republic of China around the region of Ningxia-Qinghai. Ma Qi led the Ninghai Army in November 1918 to seize and garrison Labrang monastery from the Tibetans. It left in 1927. The Tibetan Golok people, owing allegiance to Labrang, attacked the Muslim Ninghai Army several times. The Chinese had never been able to control the Goloks before. However, this time, the Muslim Ninghai Army brought their modernized weapons, and exterminated a group of Goloks. The Muslim army then called for negotiations, during which they slaughtered the Goloks, klling \\"men, women and children\\", and drowned thousands of them in the Yellow River. A Christian missionary praised the Muslim army for exterminating the Goloks, saying that it was \\"God\\", who enabled the Muslim victory. After Tibetans attacked the Ninghai Muslim army in 1922 and 1923, the Ninghai army returned in 1924 and crushed the Tibetans, killing numerous Tibetans. At Ganjia and Serchentang, General Ma Bufang defeated Tibetans under Gonpo Dondrup on 27 June 1924 and 25–27 April 1925. The Tibetans suffered severe casualties. In 1925, a Tibetan rebellion broke out, with thousands of Tibetans driving out the Muslims. Ma Qi responded with 3,000 Chinese Muslim troops, who retook Labrang and machine gunned thousands of Tibetan monks as they tried to flee.(Note, the google book link has gone haywire, but you should still be directed to page 123 when you go to the link, where you should see the paragraph the reference is from) When Ma Qi joined the Kuomintang, the Ninghai army was reorganized into the National Revolutionary Army 26th Division, under Ma Qi's command. Wei Fu -chih was born in Kao-lan district in Gansu in 1895, his alma mater was Paoting Military Officers' College, and among the positions he held was battalion commander in artillery corps of the Ninghai Army.
