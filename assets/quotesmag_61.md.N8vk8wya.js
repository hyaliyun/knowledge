History=Origins The line is the product of two lines, the former Line 8 from to Nuevos Ministerios and the former Suburbano (also known as Line S) from to , this section being named line 10 in the 1980s, and formerly operated by FEVE until the management of Line S was transferred to the Community of Madrid. In the 1990s, Madrid planned for these two lines to become one, but there was a problem in that Line 8 used wider train sets than Line S. As a remedy, Madrid decided rebuild the Suburbano section to fit the large-profile rolling stock, a project that took five years to complete. This project removed all island platforms, widened tunnels, and modernized stations. The section between Alonso Martinez and Nuevos Ministerios was completely built, with an intermediate station at . While this project was in progress the line was extended from the new Casa de Campo station to . The former section between Casa de Campo and Aluche was transferred to Line 5, which now terminates at Casa de Campo.

The complex serves as the entry point for all darshans and there are very few exceptions. History The mid-1970s saw a sudden spike in the pilgrim inflow to the temple with rapid improvements in access to Tirupati and Tirumala. TTD added hundreds of cottages on the hills in Tirumala but could not address the crowd management fully. With the lack of infrastructure to hold pilgrims, the temple witnessed serpentine queues outside the temple and during peak season circling the 4 mada streets. TTD under the leadership of Sri P.V.R.K. Prasad (Executive Officer) and B.Nagi Reddy (Chairman, Board of Trustees) planned for a queue complex system that could hold 14,000 people as a solution for crowd management. Work began in 1980 and was completed in 1983. The then, Chief Minister N. T. Rama Rao inaugurated the facility in 1983. Additions were made to the queue complex by additional rooms on the north western side of the temple in 1985 but those have been removed and replaced by a second queue complex in 2000 that is located down the road from the first queue complex. At present, Queue complex-1 (old) caters to all Arjita Seva, Special Darshan (Paid Darshan), Cellar Ticket ticket holders. Pilgrims opting for Sarvadarshan (free entrance) are sent through Queue complex -2 (new). Queue Complex Bridge connecting Queue complex to Temple. Temple is on the right side of the photo and the steps to reach the Queue complex (not seen here) is seen at the front left side of the photo The Vaikuntham Queue complex is a semicircular building and opens into a garden maintained by TTD. The complex is situated on the southwest corner of the temple and is separated from the temple by the South Mada Street. The building has 3 levels in total and there are 19 rooms in each level. Each room has 2 doors - one for allow pilgrims into the room and the other for pilgrims to exit to room and enter the corridor leading to the temple. The corridors connects to the southeast end of the temple by an overhead bridge. After the descent, the pilgrims turn around the corner and enter the temple through the main gopuram. To ensure pilgrims entering the temple for various activities are allowed at the same time, there are 2 queues and attendants inside the gopuram route the pilgrims appropriately. Features=Basic Facilities Inside the holding areas and rooms, TTD will provide free food , fresh milk as well as medical aid facilities. Sanitary needs are also taken care. Each compartment is provided with LED TV screening Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel(SVBC) - A TTD owned Devotional channel. Security The entrance to the Vaikuntham Queue complex is manned by Police, security and temple officials. For Arjita Seva ticket holders, the tickets are checked manually before allowing pilgrims inside the complex. Various sign boards indicate the location of the room where pilgrims need to report for their darshan or seva. Outside the room, the ticket is checked along with the fingerprints and (as necessary) face matches with the biometric data provided at the time of ticket purchase. Just before entering the temple, there is a baggage scanner to check bags carried inside the temple. Pilgrims would be asked to leave the queue complex and deposit mobile phones and cameras if present, a scenario that could delay darshan. Inside the queue complex as well as in the temple (leading right to the sanctum sanctorum), TTD has installed security cameras to oversee pilgrims' movements.

A typical show consisted of King interviewing a guest, then taking phone calls from listeners for the guest, and then taking phone calls on any topic. In 1982 the show won a Peabody Award. King interviewing Vladimir Putin Origin In 1978, King went from a local show on station WIOD in Miami, Florida to a national show, inheriting the nightly nationwide talk show slot on the Mutual Broadcasting System, that had previously been hosted by \\"Long John\\" Nebel and Candy Jones on the network until Nebel's illness and death, and had been pioneered by Herb Jepko in 1975. The main reason King got the Mutual job is that he had once been an announcer at WGMA-AM in Hollywood, Florida, which was then owned by C. Edward Little. Little went on to become president of Mutual and he hired King as Nebel's replacement. King's debut program on Mutual was broadcast from Miami on January 30, 1978, where his first guest was Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula. Production of the show soon moved to Mutual's main studios in Crystal City, Virginia near Washington, D.C. and it rapidly developed a large and devoted audience. Show format Mutual broadcast the show live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time. King would interview a guest for the first hour, with callers asking questions that continued the interview for another 2 hours. When he interviewed authors, King said that he would not read their books in advance, so that he would not know more about the book than his audience. King said \\"The less I know, the better I feel about a person or book.\\" King recalled that due to the number of calls coming in on the early days of the show \\"there was more than one occasion when [area code] 703 blew\\". King said that he originally wanted a toll-free phone number for call-in, but came to believe that he got a better quality of calls when the callers had to pay for them. The show was successful, starting with relatively few affiliates and eventually growing to more than 500, when King stepped down from the show in 1994. In 1985, King began appearing on television with Larry King Live for CNN; he would continue to broadcast his Mutual radio show later in the evening. C-SPAN would annually record, and then repeatedly show, an entire program on cable TV. Some years, C-SPAN would simulcast the Mutual radio broadcast, so that TV viewers could watch the show live (as radio listeners normally heard it). Open Phone America At 3 a.m., King would allow callers to discuss any topic they chose with him, until the end of the program, when he expressed his own political opinions. That segment was called Open Phone America. Many stations in the western time zones would carry Open Phone America live, followed by the guest interview on tape delay. Thus listeners from across the country could call into Open Phone America. Callers to the show would be told (on air) to call the number and \\"When the connection rings, let it ring. We'll answer when it's your turn.\\" Some of King's regular callers used pseudonyms, or nicknames given by King such as \\"The Numbers Guy\\", \\"The (Syracuse) Chair\\", \\"The Portland Laugher,\\" \\"The Scandal Scooper,\\" \\"The Miami Derelict,\\" \\"The Todd Cruz Caller,\\" \\"The Water Is Warm Caller\\", and \\"Mr. Radio\\". \\"Mr. Radio\\" made over 200 calls to King during Open Phone America. Humor King would occasionally entertain the audience by telling amusing anecdotes from his youth and early career in radio, such as a story about him and his friends faking the death of a schoolmate, or his popular Carvel ice cream story (a story which turned out to be apparently untrue) . The show also occasionally featured a \\"fictional alien, Gork of the planet Fringus\\", \\"who supposedly existed one year in the future, giving highlights of the coming year on Earth\\". During the early years of the program, King would occasionally play music featuring the \\"Mutual Symphony Orchestra\\". Final year King's primary guest host since the early 1980s had been Jim Bohannon, who began hosting his own Saturday evening call- in show on Mutual in 1985, with a format identical to King's program. In 1993, Mutual moved the Larry King Show to an afternoon time slot and offered King's late evening time slot to Bohannon. Most radio stations with a talk show format at that time had an established policy of broadcasting local programming in the late afternoon time-slot (3 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time) that Mutual now offered King's program. As a result, many of King's overnight affiliates declined to carry the daytime show and it was unable to generate the same audience size. After sixteen years on Mutual, King decided to resign from the program, with his final broadcast heard on May 27, 1994. Mutual gave King's afternoon time-slot to David Brenner. Mutual affiliates were given the option of carrying the audio of King's new CNN evening television program. The Westwood One radio simulcast of King's CNN show continued until December 31, 2009.

Biography Broussard was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the son of Clemire and Eugenia Broussard. At the age of sixteen, he moved with his family to California, where his father was a longshoreman, and his mother worked as a seamstress. As a young man, Broussard held various part-time jobs, including selling shoes and working in a canning plant. He financed his own education, first at San Francisco City College, then the University of California at Berkeley, and the Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley. At Boalt, he was vice-president of the Boalt Hall Law Students Association and a contributor to the California Law Review. After graduating in 1953, he served in the United States Army for two years. After leaving the Army, he became the research attorney for Raymond E. Peters, Presiding Justice of the California Court of Appeal, First District, Division One. In 1959, Broussard entered private practice with Wilson, Metoyer & Sweeny. Broussard was one of a group of influential African American leaders in East Bay politics, including Norvel Smith, and state Court of Appeal Justice Clinton White. He was part of a coterie that used to meet at the pharmacy of William Byron Rumford, along with Lionel Wilson. In 1972, Broussard was the first African American to be elected President of the California Judges Association. He also became Chairman of the Board of the Center for Judicial Education and Research. After retiring from the judiciary, Broussard served on the Oakland Port Commission, which involved visiting ports around the world, especially Asia. In 1987, he led a group of 72 lawyers, port officials including: port commissioner Carole Ward Allen, and city officials on a 3-week long trip to China meeting the Mayor of Shanghai, Jiang Zemin. Shanghai is a \\"twin city\\" of San Francisco. Judicial career Broussard was one of the first African-Americans to become a judge in California. In 1964, California Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown appointed Broussard as a judge of the Municipal Court for the Oakland-Piedmont (later Oakland-Piedmont- Emeryville) Judicial District. His record caught the attention of Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who, in 1975, appointed Broussard as a judge of the Superior Court of Alameda County. He went on to serve as Presiding Judge of the Superior Court. In 1981 Governor Jerry Brown elevated Broussard to the California Supreme Court, where he served as Associate Justice until 1991. His term followed Wiley Manuel, who was on the bench 1977-1981. On the court, Broussard was a leading liberal in the court's majority, along with Chief Justice Rose Bird. He wrote the majority of opinions for the court at that time. California Supreme Court Justice Looks at Law and Society, 1964-1996: Allen E. Broussard. Calisphere. Retrieved August 2, 2017. By 1982, five of the seven justices on the court were Brown appointees, who were widely criticized as allegedly soft on crime and overly political. Even though the judges had different individual philosophies, they were lumped together by conservative politicians who derisively labeled them as \\"Jerry's Judges\\" and \\"Rosie & The Supremes.\\" Critics repeatedly claimed that Broussard and other Brown appointees ruled on the basis of personal opinion and political bias rather than the law and the state Constitution. In 1982, Broussard was up for election reconfirmation. A campaign was waged against him and the other Brown appointees on the ballot that year (Cruz Reynoso and Otto Kaus), something that was unprecedented in California history. Broussard was reconfirmed to a 12-year term, as expected, with 56% of the vote, but that was below the typical confirmation vote. In 1986, three of his colleagues (Bird, Cruz Reynoso, and Joseph Grodin) were resoundingly voted off the court, and they were replaced by conservative justices. Broussard was disturbed by this development and expressed fear that the judiciary would become politicized. On August 31, 1991, Broussard retired from the court and Governor Pete Wilson appointed Ronald M. George to the seat. Personal life As chairman of a civic organization called Men of Tomorrow, he contacted Odessa Monroe, the program director of the radio station KSAN, seeking free air time. He went on to marry her in 1959, and they had two sons, Keith and Craig.

The towns linked by Line 12 are Alcorc√≥n, Legan√©s, Getafe, Fuenlabrada and M√≥stoles. Despite parts of the line running through uninhabited territory, there are no above-ground sections in an effort to facilitate future urban development. At a total length of 40.6 km, it is the longest line in the network and even more extensive than Lines 9 and 10 with their appendages to the north and south. Despite this, Line 12 accumulated only about 32 million trips in 2018, down from 34.8 million in the previous year, making it the only line to lose users in that time and the third least used after the yet-to-be-completed Line 11 and the airport connection Line 8. This decrease was mainly caused by renovation works necessitating the temporary closure of sections of the line. Stations Alcorc√≥n Central Metro Station Existing Line 12 stations have elements of art, such as the murals in the Hospital Severo Ochoa Station honoring the Nobel Prize winning biochemist, Severo Ochoa.

History The Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway opened the line to Blyth on 3 March 1847 and the first station was at Croft Street (now King Street). On 1 May 1867 a new station was opened to replace the original station. It was at the north end of Turner Street (now part of Regent Street) on the site now occupied by Morrisons supermarket and the Community Hospital. The Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway became the Blyth and Tyne Railway in 1853 and was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1874. By the 1890s the increase in goods and passenger traffic was such that a new station was needed. The NER originally planned to build a new station on newly reclaimed land on Bridge Street, between Union Street and Beaconsfield Street, but these were turned down after an objection from the neighbouring Thomas Knight Memorial Hospital, on the grounds of noise. The NER therefore rebuilt the existing station between 1894 and 1896, at a cost of ¬£20,000. Most of the building was by J & W Simpson of Blyth. Despite being next to a through line, the station was a terminus. It faced Turner Street and had a single island platform projecting from the rear which was half covered by a glazed apex canopy. Adjacent were a goods shed next to Delaval Terrace and a coaling stage. To the west stood South Blyth loco shed, first built in 1879 with three roads and extended to six roads in 1895, and a cattle dock. To the north passed the freight-only lines to the NER coaling staiths, Blyth gas works, Blyth Harbour Commission and shipyard. The station originally had two signal boxes: Blyth Signal Box at the end of the passenger platforms and Blyth Crossing Box controlling the level crossing near the engine shed on Renwick Road (previously Alexandra Crescent). Blyth Signal Box was destroyed by a German parachute mine on the night of 25 April 1941, killing the signaller instantly. Thereafter only Blyth Crossing Box was used. Passenger services were withdrawn on 2 November 1964 under The Reshaping of British Railways; the station buildings stood derelict until they were demolished in 1972. Today nothing remains of the station itself or associated buildings, except for the Station Master's house in Delaval Terrace which survives as a private home. Proposals for a new railway service By the 1990s local councils were considering the feasibility of restoring passenger services linking and Blyth with . These early, informal, proposals suggested serving Blyth, not by reopening the branch to Blyth, but by reopening Newsham station where the Blyth branch joined the now freight-only Blyth and Tyne main line. Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to , serving Blyth in this way. In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle and was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested that due to redevelopment of sections of the former branch line, Blyth should be served by a new park and ride station close to the site of Bebside station, though Newsham would also be reopened to serve the Newsham area of the town. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. The county council has, however, continued to develop the project, announcing an additional ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. Indeed, under the ¬£90 million Phase 1, Newsham would be the only station reopened to serve Blyth on the Newcastle to Ashington Northumberland Line passenger service; possibly occurring as early as 2022. The park and ride station at Bebside proposed in the GRIP 2 study is instead proposed as an additional station to be added in Phase 2. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transfroming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the reintroduction of passenger services between Newcastle, Newsham and Ashington, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment for the project.

Plot On the distant planet Pangea, a transmission of the TV series The Adventures of Captain Zoom in Outer Space is seen by the child genius brother of native forces leader Tyra. Tyra has been captured by the tyrannical Lord Vox of Vestron whose people, subsequent to some global catastrophe, migrated to the stars from Pangea thousands of years ago and now seeks to recover the lost ancient knowledge of their people. Lord Vox intends to do this by conquering Pangea, their old homeworld, and with the knowledge, rebuild it as the seat of his empire. In his desperation, Tyra's brother brings Captain Zoom to Pangea with hopes that he can save his sister and defeat the Vestrons. Unfortunately, the actor playing Captain Zoom possess none of the heroic qualities of Zoom but is instead arrogant and egotistical. Though Captain Zoom is reluctant to lead the natives, his attempts to explain that he is only an actor leads the natives to believe he is a spy because he \\"is paid to pretend to be other people\\". He quickly backtracks, pretending that he was testing them, and through various adventures and using his old television stories as inspiration, he leads the natives to a victory by default as Lord Vox is turned into a statue by an ancient guardian.

The writer Virginia Woolf and her husband, the political activist, journalist and editor Leonard Woolf, bought the house by auction at the White Hart Hotel, Lewes, on 1 July 1919 for 700 pounds, and received there many visitors connected to the Bloomsbury Group, including T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, Roger Fry and Lytton Strachey. The purchase is described in detail in her Diary, vol. 1, pp. 286‚Äì8. Virginia's sister, the artist Vanessa Bell, lived at nearby Charleston Farmhouse in Firle from 1916, and though contrasting in style, both houses became important outposts of the Bloomsbury Group. The National Trust now operates the building as a writer's house museum.  Life at Monk's House  Busts of Virginia and Leonard Woolf in the garden of Monk's House During the Woolfs' early years at Rodmell, Monk's House was of modest dimensions with three-quarters of an acre of garden including an orchard and a number of outbuildings. Conditions were primitive and over the years the Woolfs made many alterations and additions, including: improvements to the kitchen; the installation of a hot water range and bathroom with water closet; and a two- storey extension in 1929. In 1928 they bought an adjoining field to preserve the beautiful views from the garden towards Mount Caburn.The Diary of Virginia Woolf, ed. Anne Olivier Bell and Andrew McNeillie, 5 vols, Hogarth Press, 1977‚Äì84; The Letters of Virginia Woolf, ed. Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann, 6 vols, Hogarth Press, 1975‚Äì80. The Woolfs spent more and more time in Rodmell, eventually living there full-time from 1940 when their flat in Mecklenburgh Square, Bloomsbury, London, was damaged during an air raid. The solitude of village life allowed Virginia respite from the tumult of London, and it was in the small wooden lodge at the bottom of the garden that many of her novels took shape. Jacob's Room, published in 1922, Mrs Dalloway (1925), To The Lighthouse (1927), Orlando (1928), The Waves (1931), The Years (1937) and Between The Acts (1941), as well as other works, were also written there. Her final novel, Between the Acts,Between the Acts, Hogarth Press, 1941. published posthumously in July 1941, is steeped in references to Rodmell and the traditions and values of its villagers. Virginia documented her life at the house in photographs. Preserved in the Monk's House Albums, these include portraits and group pictures of many who visited the house.Maggie Humm, Snapshots of Bloomsbury: The Private Lives of Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell, Tate Publishing, 2006. In March 1941, Virginia committed suicide by drowning herself in the nearby River Ouse. Leonard continued to live at Monk's House until his death in 1969, and played an active role in village life. Both he and Virginia had been members of the Socialist Party, and he became a manager of the village school in Rodmell in the 1930s. He was also treasurer and president of the Rodmell and District Horticultural Society.LW Papers, University of Sussex Library Manuscript Collections.  Monk's House today  Virginia Woolf's bed at Monk's House Upon Leonard's death the house was bequeathed to his close friend, the artist Trekkie Parsons, n√©e Ritchie, who sold it to the University of Sussex in 1972. It was eventually turned over to the National Trust in 1980, and is open to the public. The ground floor, including sitting room, dining room, kitchen and Virginia's bedroom, is on display and Virginia's writing lodge can be found at the bottom of the garden with views across to Mount Caburn.

History On 1 December 1998, the line was extended from to . The stations in this section were marked with a unique wall color in each station, making it easy to spot one's destination from the train. For example, Pavones is white, Valdebernardo is yellow, Vic√°lvaro is a light shade of turquoise, and San Cipriano is orange. This approach is being applied in many other new or recently refurbished stations like Sevilla on Line 2, though there is no representation of the colours on official system maps. On 11 July 2008, the infill station Rivas Futura opened, located between Rivas-Urbanizaciones and Rivas Vaciamadrid. On 28 March 2011, the line was extended north from Herrera Oria to Mirasierra. On 25 March 2015 the line was extended further north to . Originally, this station was to be named Costa Brava, but because musician and guitarist Paco de Luc√≠a died in 2014, the Transport Authorities decided to change its name to pay tribute.

Line 9B At Puerta de Arganda, an island platform was built, so passengers who required to use the southern extension (\\"line 9B\\") can move directly across the platform to from the primary route (\\"line 9A\\"). This southern extension runs through mostly unpopulated areas connecting the two towns of Rivas- Vaciamadrid and Arganda del Rey. The line runs with only two or three car trains at comparatively long intervals through scenic landscape of Spanish desert. Rivas-Urbanizaciones and Arganda del Rey are underground stations with large island platforms, and Rivas Futura, Rivas Vaciamadrid and La Poveda are surface stations with side platforms. Given the continuous growth of particularly Rivas-Vaciamadrid, there are many plans for the future of Line 9B.

The highest mountain in the center is Inovec (1042 m). Pova≈æsk√Ω Inovec is a mountain range in western Slovakia, named after the V√°h river. It is 48 km (30 mi) long and 15‚Äì25 km (9-16 mi) wide mountain range. It is situated from the city of Hlohovec, raising from the Danubian Hills, and slowly raising further north until nearly to the city of Trenƒç√≠n where it borders the Str√°≈æov Mountains, where is also the highest hill of the entire mountain range, Inovec (1042 m). The mountain range separates basins of the V√°h and Nitra rivers. There are many monuments in or near the mountain range, including Great Moravian hill fort Kostolec near Ducov√©, Hlohovec Castle near Hlohovec, Beckov Castle near Beckov, Topoƒæƒçany Castle and Temat√≠n Castle. The famous spa city of Pie≈°≈•any lies under Pova≈æsk√Ω Inovec.  Geology  Pova≈æsk√Ω Inovec Mts. is considered as asymmetric horst emerging from the Neogene sedimentary fill of the Pannonian Basin between the V√°h and Nitra rivers. The horst is bordered by steep normal faults and usually divided from north to south into three segments (or blocks). Basement rocks are in the northern portion dominated by crystalline schists (mostly diaphthorites, phyllonites, biotite micaschists and gneisses, amphibolites and migmatites). Extensive Late Paleozoic volcanosedimentary succession (K√°lnica group) is present in the cover unit, in the area between the Selec and Hr√°dok villages. Sparse relicts of peculiar Upper Cretaceous sediments (Belice unit) are locally present in the northern and southern block. The transversal Hr√°dok reverse fault separates the northern block from the central block. Only the central block shows typical structure of the Fatra-Tatra Belt which is typical composed of Tatric crystalline basement composed of granitoids and gneisses, covered by the Mesozoic deposits and two superimposed cover nappes (lower Fatric unit and upper Hronic unit). Granitoid rocks form the Bojn√° and the Zlatn√≠ky massifs. The Fatric nappe is represented by the Zliechov succession. The Hronic nappe is preserved in outlayers, e.g. in the Temat√≠n or Beckov Castle rocks. Both cover nappes are composed of the Triassic to Early Cretaceous rocks, mostly limestones, marlstones and dolomites. Relicts of the clastic deposits of Inner-Carpathian Paleogene Basin are found on the western slopes of the mountains. Paleontology The ƒåertova pec caves near Rado≈°ina have yielded relics of multiple human habitation from the Stone Age.

Ramos. The plan envisioned the Philippines achieving a newly industrialized country status by the year 2000. Platform The Philippines 2000 platform largely hinged on five major areas: *Peace and Stability *Economic Growth and Sustainable Development *Energy and Power Generation *Environmental Protection *Streamlined Bureaucracy The Philippines 2000 program formed the core of the Ramos campaign platform in the 1992 elections which largely centered on economic reforms and improved national security and unity. Effects and legacy The Philippines 2000 platform was widely successful, making it one of the greatest legacies of the Ramos administration to the Philippines. Ramos was successfully able to open the then-closed Philippine economy and break Marcos-era formed monopolies, especially with regard to Philippine Airlines and the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, which were privatized and de-monopolized during his tenure. He was also able to resolve the power crisis in the Philippines through privatization of power plants and the construction of new ones. The reforms spurred additional investment into the Philippines. Other economic reforms achieved during the Ramos administration was the re-adjustment of the value added tax from four percent to an International Monetary Fund and World Bank-mandated ten percent. The success of the reforms paved the way for the Philippines to be called \\"Asia's New Tiger\\". Economic reforms instituted during the Ramos era enabled the Philippines to experience growth rates of up to nine percent annually, and enjoy annual budget surpluses well into his tenure. The economic reforms instituted in the Philippines 2000 platform would have an effect on how the Philippines would be affected in the 1997 East Asian financial crisis. Perhaps one of the greatest legacies of Philippines 2000 regarding peace and stability was the 1996 peace treaty signed between the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front, ending over thirty years of conflict on the island of Mindanao. Successors The Philippines 2000 program would be succeeded by two other socio-economic programs: Angat Pinoy 2004, instituted by Joseph Estrada, the ten-point Strong Republic agenda instituted by Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Tuwid na Daan agenda instituted by Benigno Aquino III, and the Build Build Build agenda instituted by Rodrigo Duterte.

Biography Almost nothing is known about Robinson's life. He was relatively young, according to his own account, in 1617, and therefore may have been born not long before 1600. He may also have survived past 1660, earning a living as a schoolmaster.(Dobson 1957 p. ix) Works His only known published work is The Art of Pronuntiation, a handbook of English phonetics, published in 1617, and apparently a poor seller, as only one copy survives, in Oxford's Bodleian library. The Art of Pronuntiation contains two parts. The first Vox Audienda, attempts in a very elementary and far from satisfactory way to give an account of the sounds of English in articulatory terms. The second, Vox Videnda is more interesting, as it sets forth an ingenious, if occasionally defective, alphabet to represent these sounds. Unlike other attempts at a phonetic English character (such as that of Alexander Gil), Robinson's alphabet breaks entirely free from the basis of the Roman alphabet, using characters that bear only an accidental resemblance to Roman letters, while having a systematic relation to each other. Robinson's alphabet is not only phonetic but to some extent featural, as voicing is not represented on the letters themselves, but by means of diacritics, in a mode that takes some account of assimilative voicing and devoicing of consonant clusters; English stress accent is also indicated by diacritics. Nasal stops are marked by a modification of the letters representing oral stops. Included in The Art of Pronuntiation is Robinson's transcription of a Latin poem (presumably of his own composition), which exemplifies the idiosyncratic pronunciation used in English Latin schools of his time ‚Äî and also, with sound-changes concurrent with those taking place in English, down to the 19th century, and thus provides valuable evidence as to the traditional adaptation of Latin to English phonology. Unpublished works Even more significant than Robinson's published work, however, is his transcription (unpublished in his lifetime) of several poems by Richard Barnfield into this alphabet. These transcriptions provide very valuable evidence as to the pronunciation of English in Robinson's time; a pronunciation which, perhaps due to Robinson's youth or place of origin, contains many features that are more modern than Gil's, and which exemplify (even within a single text) several contemporary changes occurring in the pronunciation of English. Robinson's phonetics Robinson distinguishes ten vowels in English, which he clearly considers to be distinct in quality as well as length. The long vowels are implied to be midway in quality between the neighbouring short vowels. In his alphabet, however, he treats them as pairs, with the long vowels being in shape inverted forms of the short vowels. Although interpretation of his symbolism is necessary, very approximately his vowels can be assigned as follows: *First pair: Short Long *Second pair: Short Long *Third pair: Short Long *Fourth pair: Short Long *Fifth pair: Short Long or (according to Robinson, \\"almost extended to the inward place of the consonants\\") Representative words are: # \\"love\\" (ModE ), \\"rose\\" (ModE ) # \\"hot\\" (ModE ), \\"cause\\" (ModE ) # \\"sad\\" (ModE ), \\"name\\" (ModE ) # \\"best\\" (ModE ), \\"please\\" (ModE ) # \\"rich\\" (ModE ), \\"queen\\" (ModE ) The vowel assignments must be taken as extremely approximate, better reflecting the relationships between the vowels than their precise sound. Robinson's diphthongs are: * or perhaps in ) \\"plain\\" (ModE ). This sound was in process of merging with (e.g. \\"day\\" both and , \\"against\\" both and ), hence the inference that it may have been . * in \\"thoughts\\" (ModE ) * in \\"fine\\" (ModE ) * in \\"few\\" (ModE ) * in \\"view\\" (ModE ) * in \\"coin\\" (ModE ) * in \\"ground\\" (ModE ) but also in \\"soul\\" (ModE ) and likewise \\"cold\\", \\"gold\\", etc. * in \\"moon\\" (ModE ) See also *List of phonetics topics *Alexander Gil ReferencesSources Dobson, E.J., 1957.

Saguaro was also the first Palm OS application capable of competing with the graphic performance of the iPhone. History Saguaro, produced by PDA Performance, Inc., had a long development cycle of three years. Currently, the full version is not available for download, however, two beta versions had been released: Saguaro Beta (a private beta) and Saguaro Sneak Peek (a public beta). Information about the Saguaro private beta is severely lacking, however it is speculated to be more full-featured than the public beta. PDA Performance released lineUp, an application based on Saguaro‚Äôs code, on November 30, 2007. PDA Performance announced their closure on February 28, 2008. As a result, a complete version of Saguaro has not been released. Specifications Little data is available on the technical specifications of Saguaro, as PDA Performance had not released an SDK. Saguaro was rumored to implement cooperative multitasking for Saguaro-compatible applications, referred to as \\"widgets\\". The term caused speculation in the Palm community as to whether Saguaro was intended to replace the Palm OS to run applications or if it was designed to be a widget engine. Saguaro was also rumored to be capable of running \\"legacy\\" palm applications by acting as a launcher. Saguaro featured its own graphics engine, called \\"MojaveGL\\", which also functioned as a window manager. MojaveGL is capable of alpha blending, thus allowing Saguaro to create translucent windows. LineUp LineUp is a widget engine developed by PDA Performance that is heavily based on Saguaro's code. LineUp has relatively few widgets available, of which most are news-based (CNN, CNET, Washington Post, etc).

It was designed as a framework to assist researchers to design or evaluate marketing research studies. The name was deliberately chosen to be similar to the Marketing Mix - it also has four Ps. Unlike the marketing mix these elements are sequential and they match the main phases that need to be followed. These four Ps are: Purpose; Population; Procedure and Publication.  Purpose  The purpose of the research is the reason why it is being done. The word ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù is useful because it has a wide coverage. It can be specifically defined or it can be loosely explained. The wide term also embraces studies to gather marketing intelligence, where the manager's role is to scan the environment for useful data, and there may be no specific objective. Many marketers avoid the term hypothesis entirely and tend to use the words ‚Äúresearch objective‚Äù or ‚Äúaim‚Äù. The word hypothesis (plural, hypotheses) is quite different from the terms mentioned above. It is an essential starting point for quantitative researchers, but takes a lesser role for qualitative researchers. The term is deeply rooted in the history of scientific thought. In statistics we expend much time and energy to generate hypotheses, to test hypotheses, and to reject them. Some people argue that we should only test one hypothesis; others say we should test several. In hypothesis testing we create a statement, which may be true or false, this statement is a \\"proposition\\" - we propose that something may be the case. If it is right then we accept it. If it is not right, if it is \\"wrong\\" then we reject it. The first step is to formulate the null- hypothesis, abbreviated to Ho. This is usually intended to be rejected. Another carefully constructed hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis or the H1; this is actually called the 'research hypothesis'. After these have been articulated the researcher can design a research programme to test the hypotheses. When the results are received, they are examined against the prediction of the null hypothesis. The basic idea is to use this possible explanation and then look for data to support the explanation (or not). It is best to spend as much time as possible on the hypothesis: it is the research question, and it determines how the study is carried out. It determines the design because it defines the problem. The subject of hypothesis testing has been debated heavily for many years and there are suggestions that misuse of null hypothesis significance testing is widespread and damaging (Finch et al. 2001), at least in psychological research. It is relevant to cite an article on hypothesis testing in marketing research by Lawrence (1982) who tells us: \\"Practical survey researchers (realise) that, in many cases, no adequate theory exists for setting up hypotheses in advance\\". The article continues: \\"Drawing one-off hypotheses out of the air offers no solution to the problem. Researchers will be guided by their own ideas, experiences, hunches\\".  Population  When considering any market sector we need to ask ‚ÄúWho is involved in this marketplace?‚Äù Who are the players? Who should be the centre of the investigation and where are those subjects? This area considers the target audience, customer or player; the users or non-users. Who will become the respondent or informant? Should we contact all players or just some of them? Should we carry out a census or a sample: should respondents be selected by probability or non-probability methods? An important concept for primary research is sampling. We choose to interview or observe people who we think will give us the information that will solve our problems. So in choosing our research method, we need to consider whom we select and how we select. This applies to qualitative research, with only a few people, and quantitative research with many people. Much emphasis in marketing research is on the end user, but ‚Äúexperts‚Äù can bridge the gap between primary and secondary data. An expert may be someone who has been in the business for many years. This part of the MR Mix involves identifying relevant sampling frames.  Procedure  When considering the procedure the key question is ‚ÄúHow should the study be conducted?‚Äù Will it be qualitative or quantitative? This area also covers the question of timing: when will the fieldwork take place? The best research starts by looking at secondary data, this information already exists. The two basic sources: internal (within an organisation) and external, published by someone outside have become easier to access in recent years. Information Technology, with Intranets and the Internet, has improved our ability to find such data. If secondary data doesn't solve the problem then original data (primary data) is sought. It is useful to think of different primary methods in these terms: we can ask people what they are doing; we can watch them or detect what they have done by counting or we can manipulate some variables to discover the effect. This creates three categories: questioning; observation and experimentation. Primary data collection techniques can be subdivided into: interviewer-administered or respondent-administered; direct or indirect; personal or impersonal. Processing data, analysis and interpretation are essential parts of the procedure. Detailed examination of the appropriate tools used in the data collection needs to take place.  Publication  Under the heading of ‚ÄúPublication‚Äù the key questions are: Who is the audience for the results? What should be communicated? When and how should they be communicated? Research is of no use if findings are kept within the research team; similarly commercially sensitive information will have no competitive advantage if placed in the public domain. Choices need to be made on how publication takes place. Will a written report be created? Will tabulations be provided? Will a personal presentation take place? Who should be allowed sight of the results? There are many different readers of research reports and these audiences all have very different expectations. Reporting must be personalised, writing and presentation style must be customised and adapted to the user. At one extreme there is the general public. There are many reasons why research is reported to the ‚Äúmass consumer‚Äù. It may be a government report that has been commissioned to be in the public interest: concerning health, welfare, transport and so on. It may be a consumer report: consumer watchdog reports are of great interest to the man on the street, so we find the Which? Magazine and similar bodies have enabled the layman appreciate survey findings. Editors of periodicals regularly commission research for editorial reasons, so the results may become part of an article for mass consumption. The research agency may report directly to the public on web pages, by email or by post, this is because it is now common to offer a short summary report to a respondent as a gesture of goodwill, an incentive, a thank you for co- operating in the research. Research findings may appear as part of a promotional campaign, appealing to the consumer's need to know that indeed this is a best seller (‚Äúnine out of ten cat-owners prefer‚Ä¶‚Äù). Then there are smaller audiences such as managers who are anxious to receive a report in order to make instant decisions. Additionally there are managers who will benefit from the information much later when the report is consulted as secondary data in the future.

The Harty Ferry to Sheppey previously operated from near the wild-life lookout point on the reserve. The muddy Oare Creek forms the eastern edge of the reserve and lead inland to the village of Oare. The Oare and Faversham Creeks are open for navigation at high tide. There is a history of boat building and repair of historic boats and Thames Sailing Barges in the creeks. Close to Oare village is the Oare Meadow, also operated, like the Oare Marshes reserve by the Kent Wildlife Trust. Birds The reserve is of international importance for migratory, over wintering and breeding wetland birds. Suitable habitat is achieved through manipulation of water levels and livestock grazing. The reserve supports an exciting and diverse range of birds. Amongst the breeding species found here are pied avocet, common redshank, common snipe, northern lapwing, water rail, bearded reedling, common tern and garganey. Migrating species include black-tailed godwit, ruff, little stint, curlew sandpiper and whimbrel. Overwintering species include brent goose, dunlin, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian wigeon, merlin, hen harrier, short-eared owl, Eurasian bittern and twite.

Couture-Nowak (February 17, 1958 ‚Äì April 16, 2007) was an instructor of French in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia and was the only Canadian victim of the Virginia Tech shooting. She was a native of Canada, and while residing in Truro, Nova Scotia, she co-founded the first Francophone school in the region. Life and career Born in Montreal, she was raised in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, the eldest of five children. She graduated from Yarmouth Consolidated Memorial High School in 1981. Couture initially worked at a newly opened daycare operated by the Yarmouth Boys and Girls Club. She began to pursue her teaching career at the Nova Scotia Teachers College in Truro. She graduated in 1989 then obtained a degree from St. Mary's University in Halifax in the early 1990s. While living in Truro, Couture worked as a French instructor in the Humanities Department at Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC). She married Jerzy Nowak, an instructor in the Horticulture Department at NSAC. Couture- Nowak had two daughters, Sylvie and Francine. With two other local Francophone parents, Couture-Nowak established the √âcole acadienne de Truro, the first French language public school for central Nova Scotia in September, 1997. Operated by the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial, the √âcole acadienne de Truro has grown from 36 students in 1997 to 118 students in grades Primary through 10. The school's first class of seniors graduated in 2006. In 2001, Couture-Nowak and her husband moved their family to Blacksburg, Virginia, where her husband had accepted a position as Professor and Head of the Department of Horticulture at Virginia Tech. Couture-Nowak accepted a position as an Instructor of French in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature. Throughout her life Couture-Nowak described herself as being a proud French-Canadian. Death Nowak's memorial stone on the Virginia Tech campus Couture-Nowak was teaching an Intermediate French class in Room 211 at Norris Hall on the morning of April 16, 2007 when she was killed by Seung-Hui Cho as one of the 32 victims in the Virginia Tech shooting. Couture-Nowak, one of the first to be shot in Norris 211, was 49 years old when she died. Upon hearing gunfire nearby, just before Cho arrived at Norris 211, Couture-Nowak attempted to barricade the classroom door with the help of a student and ushered her students to the back of the class for their safety while 911 was called. The attempt at barricading the door proved unsuccessful. Couture-Nowak and 11 of the 22 registered students died. Couture-Nowak died in front of the door and next to the teacher's desk. Posthumous recognition The Senate of Canada observed one minute of silence in tribute to Ms. Jocelyne Couture- Nowak. In Nova Scotia, more than 400 people attended a commemorative service for her.(French) In speeches given in the Canadian parliament shortly after the shooting, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Opposition leader St√©phane Dion made special mention of Couture-Nowak. Nova Scotian Premier Rodney MacDonald also made special mention of Couture-Nowak, and in particular spoke of her contribution to the francophone community with her key role in the development of √âcole acadienne in Truro. Couture-Nowak was discussed, along with Liviu Librescu, as potentially becoming the \\"iconic image that will forever recall the massacre at Virginia Tech\\" by CBC News Editor-in-Chief Tony Burman. Virginia Tech named her an Honorary Distinguished Instructor and the Virginia Tech Foundation established the Jocelyne Couture-Nowak Scholarship, awarded to French majors annually. , Department of Horticulture at Virginia Tech website, Retrieved on Feb. 19, 2008. Nova Scotia Agricultural College also established a bursary in her name. Students at Virginia Tech have also organized a new foreign language program named Teach for Madame in honor of Couture-Nowak, wherein members teach French to elementary school students. Jocelyne Couture-Nowak was remembered by her former French students that she taught at the all girls boarding school, Chatham Hall located in Chatham, Virginia by a candlelight vigil. In May 2008, Virginia Tech named Couture- Nowak's widower, Jerzy Nowak, as the founding director of its newly created Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention. He served as its director for three years, until his retirement from the university.

History Steve Blalock, asked why the letters WZKY were chosen, said WCKY was also near the top of the dial and people could listen to that station at night. In 1960 Suburban Radio Group, which owned nearby WEGO, bought WZKY. The company owned WZKY for 20 years. In 1967, Bob Harris, now voice of the Duke Blue Devils, offered to take over the job of announcing West Stanly High School football games for WZKY, though his only experience had been as a student announcer for Albemarle High School (North Carolina) Albemarle High School basketball. WZKY station manager Ralph Gardner gave Harris a reel-to-reel tape recorder because the 250-watt station could only broadcast during the daylight hours, and the game would not air until 11 A.M. on Saturday. Harris became morning host and sports director, and added more games, including boys' and girls' basketball, until, a 2009 Salisbury Post article said, \\"By 1975, WZKY was originating more sports programming than any other station in the state.\\" Harris remained sports director at WZKY for eight years before moving to WDNC.

The reserve is ancient semi-natural woodland situated on poorly drained London clay, with a small area of gravelly soil in the south. The underlying clay results in much surface water and mud in winter and wet summers. The soil is mostly fairly acid, as shown by the carpets of bluebells and patches of heather (Calluna vulgaris), but more alkaline elsewhere, with characteristic species such as spurge-laurel (Daphne laureola), sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii). The wood has been heavily managed in the past as wood pasture and as a source for sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) coppice. When conditions are open, after the coppice is cut, much of the ground is colonised by common cow- wheat (Melampyrum pratense), which is the food plant of the caterpillar of the rare heath fritillary (Melitaea athalia) butterfly. As the chestnut grows up again and the shade becomes denser, the habitat becomes unsuitable for the flowers and butterflies, therefore it is very important that regular coppicing is carried out to maintain open areas for our colony of one of Britain's rarest butterflies. The older coppice is, however, valuable for nesting birds such as warblers, and the maturing oak and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis) stands attract many insects and birds such as woodpeckers, nuthatches and treecreepers.

Inside the wall of the club, Brennan and her assistant, Zack Addy, discover a belly button ring with the words \\"Luv Rulz\\" engraved on it, making a fellow disc jockey, D.J. Rulz, a prime suspect. The stud came from D.J. Mount's girlfriend, who was D.J. Rulz's ex-girlfriend. When Booth and Brennan go to find Mount's girlfriend, Eve, they discover from her brother that Eve had left her daughter with him and although she had promised to return, she never did. They discover that the methamphetamine found on the money she left her brother is the same as the methamphetamine on Mount's face. She becomes a suspect until they realize she had been behind Mount at the time Mount was stuck in the wall where he was mummified, and the methamphetamine was pushed into his face from the front, indicating that there was a third person in the wall. They discover an FBI agent is working undercover for Randall Hall, the owner of the club. The agent claims that Randall is passing methamphetamine through the club. They confront Hall, who tells them that Rulz built himself a new studio a day after Mount went missing. They find Eve's body using a police cadaver dog, but Rulz did not have the strength to kill her, as he was shot through the wrist a few years ago. They find a bone dimple on both bodies, but cannot explain it. They take Rulz in, and he tells them that Mount was going to jump labels from Randall Hall's Basement Records, and that Randall paid for his studio. From this they have Randall's motive: Mount was going to jump labels and Eve was stealing his methamphetamine and cash to pay for them to have a better life. Booth goes to the club and gets Randall to poke him with his cane, and almost breaks it before Brennan realizes that his cane is what caused the bone dimples on both bodies. This is confirmed when a test in the lab show the cane created them both. The team now have forensics that confirm he is the killer.

The story of \\"DJ's mummified body found behind wall in club\\" was published by the National Post on December 7, 2003.Deitz, Corey, \\"DJ's mummified body found behind wall in club\\", About.com, December 7, 2003. Retrieved on July 14, 2007. According to the episode's writer, Elizabeth Benjamin, the story also allowed her to \\"put Brennan inside a world that is completely outside her comfort zone, and allow her not to only relate to it and find parallels in her own life, but to see her actually enjoying herself and finding it cool.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"The Man in the Wall\\" at Fox.com * * Category:Bones (TV series) episodes Category:2005 American television episodes ","title":"The Man in the Wall"},{"id":"10835902","text":"Duska may refer to: * DShK (–î–®–ö, for –î–µ–≥—Ç—è—Ä—ë–≤–∞-–®–ø–∞–≥–∏–Ω–∞ –ö—Ä—É–ø–Ω–æ–∫–∞–ª–∏–±–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π, Degtyaryova-Shpagina Krupnokaliberny, 'Degtyaryov-Shpagin Large-Calibre') is a Soviet heavy anti-aircraft machine gun. * Duska (film) (Russian and Ukrainian: –î—É—à–∫–∞), a 2007 film by Dutch director Jos Stelling ","title":"Duska"},{"id":"10835914","title":"Exploration of Uranus"},{"id":"10835949","text":"John David Gwynn (13 July 1907 ‚Äì 21 November 1998),) was a civil engineer with a special interest in renewable energy generation.Irish Times, 31 December 1998 In his youth he was one of Ireland's most distinguished cricketers.Cricket Archive profile John David Gwynn (known to family and friends as \\"David\\" or \\"JD\\") was born in Dublin on 13 July 1907. He was the eldest child of Edward Gwynn, an academic and sometime Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and Olive Mary Gwynn n√©e Ponsonby. Burke‚Äôs Irish Family Records, 1976 In accordance with family tradition he was educated at St Columba's College, Dublin and then at Trinity College, Dublin University where he studied civil engineering. While still an undergraduate he was employed by the Siemens company to assist in their work on the Shannon hydroelectric scheme. J D Gwynn went on to become a chartered civil engineer, a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a Member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. After graduating BAI in 1930 he worked on Newport Bridge in Middlesbrough as an employee of the company Mott, Hay and Anderson. In 1936 he joined Balfour Beatty and was engaged on the extension of the Piccadilly Line for London Transport. In the early 1940s J D Gwynn was again involved in developing hydro-electric power infrastructure, this time in Scotland. As the second World War continued he was put in charge of building the Churchill Barriers in Scapa Flow, Orkney, a task which occupied him from 1942 to 1944. After the war he supervised further hydro-electric schemes both in the UK and overseas. Among other assignments he was chief engineer for the Kainji Dam Project in Nigeria. He became a director of Balfour Beatty in 1963, and a director of Engineering Power and Development Consultants in 1967. In 1966 an honorary MAI degree was conferred upon him by Trinity College, Dublin. After his retirement from Balfour Beatty David Gwynn turned to the field of renewable energy, where with characteristic vigour and enthusiasm he proceeded to undertake research and develop innovative experimental designs. With his team he mounted trial schemes for various small scale stream-driven turbines as well as much larger tidal power devices, and he continued this voluntary work right up to the end of his life. J D Gwynn married twice. His first wife, Grace Lee, was a historian; she died in 1964. They had two children: Lee Penelope, a teacher and local government politician, and Robin David, an academic historian and philatelist. J D Gwynn later married Esther Hulbert, a musicologist and singer, who also predeceased him. He died at the age of 91 on 21 November 1998. Cricketing Career A right-handed batsman, he played one first-class match for Dublin University against Northamptonshire in July 1926,First-class matches played by John Gwynn at Cricket Archive a match that also featured the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett.Scorecard of Northamptonshire v Dublin University match in July 1926 at Cricket Archive Gwynn came from a cricketing family.

Neve Shalom is said to have moved to Constantinople more than 550 years ago. Sephardi Jews arrived in the Ottoman Empire from the Iberian peninsula beginning in 1492, and soon were a larger group of Jews in population than the Romaniotes. The Romaniotes of Istanbul, as in many communities, including Thessaloniki became assimilated into the Sephardic culture and adopted the Sephardic liturgy as well as the language of the Sephardim, Judesmo. The synagogue building, one of the two ancient synagogues in Istanbul's Golden Horn, was renovated in 1992 by the Quincentennial Foundation, in celebration of the 500th anniversary of Sephardic Jews' arrival in the Ottoman Empire. Ahrida Synagogue is known for its boat-shaped tevah (the reading platform, known in Ashkenazi communities as a bimah).

Its mirror is the hypnagogic state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is rational waking cognition trying to make sense of non-linear images and associations; the hypnopompic state is emotional and credulous dreaming cognition trying to make sense of real-world stolidity. They have a different phenomenological character. Hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucinations are frequently accompanied by sleep paralysis, which is a state wherein one is consciously aware of one's surroundings but unable to move or speak. For this reason they are often frightening to a person newly experiencing them. These hallucinations are believed to be the source of many perceived supernatural experiences. Hallucinations are commonly understood as \\"sensory perceptions that occur in the absence of an objective stimulus\\". As this definition implies, though, like dreams, most hallucinations are visual, they can encompass a broader range of sensory experience. Auditory hallucinations are thus also common: \\"patients can hear simple sounds, structured melodies or complete sentences\\". Slightly less common but not unheard of are \\"somesthetic\\" hallucinations involving our sense of touch and location, with such experiences ranging from tactile sensations to full-blown \\"cenesthopathic\\" or \\"out-of-body experiences\\", which involve sudden changes in the perception of the body‚Äôs location, or even a sense of movement of the entire body. Finally, a unique characteristic of hypnopompic hallucinations is that as opposed to dreams, wherein we rarely understand we‚Äôre asleep, here sleepers do indeed have \\"the clear subjective awareness of being awake\\" yet are frequently mentally and physically trapped in the experience.  Neurobiology  The objective difference between the subjective experiences of dreams and hypnopompic hallucinations emerges from a close look at our sleep cycle and its attendant brain activity: there are essentially two types of sleep, R.E.M. sleep, which is indeed categorised by \\"rapid eye movement\\" and N.R.E.M., which stands for \\"Non-Rapid Eye Movement\\". In R.E.M. sleep, our brains are extremely active. In particular, during this stage, both our brain-stem, which is the home of our most fundamental physical drives, and the parts of the cortex related to our most complex logical-cognitive functions experience highly intense electrical activity. As this perhaps suggests, R.E.M. is where the majority of dreaming occurs‚Äîit has been all but confirmed at this point that dreams originate in the brain-stem, a spark from there driving our more logical mind to contemplate and consolidate, through dreaming, memories that relate to fulfilling our fundamental drives. Conversely, there is almost no electrical activity during N.R.E.M. sleep. It will thus be no surprise that N.R.E.M. is what is referred to in layman‚Äôs terms as \\"deep sleep\\", which is characterised by the complete quieting of the mind, to include dreamlessness and by muscle \\"atonia\\", which is to say paralysis, a complete motor disconnect. A last critical point in this regard is that R.E.M. sleep cycles are book-ended by N.R.E.M. stages, which is to say that when we fall asleep and wake up, we first fall into and last arise from, N.R.E.M. sleep. It is precisely at this last point, though, that a quirk in brain chemistry, can cause hypnopompic hallucinations: occasionally during deep N.R.E.M., \\"transient patterns of neural activation in brainstem structures resemble[ing] micro-wake \\"fragments\\" can occur\\". As the origin of the fragments and their name implies, they have a twofold effect: first, just as in R.E.M. sleep, these brain-stem fragments essentially activate the dream mechanism. Second, they do catalyse a near- waking state. However, this spark is often not powerful enough to jar us completely out of deep sleep, and so only our mind fully awakens, leaving our body trapped in the atonia of deep sleep. Another reason why hypnopompic hallucinations are often such horrible experiences, is because micro-wake fragments appear to be related to serotonin and dopamine deficits‚Äîthese deficits predispose us to negative mental states, which likely causes the hallucinations to resemble our worst dreams.  Cultural manifestations  Fuseli's 1781 painting The Nightmare is thought to be a depiction of a hypnopompic hallucination These mental experiences are indeed often deeply damaging: across cultures, the experience of hypnopompic hallucinations are strongly related to \\"visitations of spirits, demons or other grotesque creatures belonging to traditional folklore\\". Thus, in the Anglosphere, hypnopompic experiences often entail the sense that an \\"Old Hag\\" or some similar \\"nocturnal spirit\\" is sitting on the sleeper‚Äôs chest, inducing both paralysis and an increasing, suffocating inability to move. Anthropologists have discovered references dating back to the High Middle ages of similar figures in Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman traditions, most prominently the \\"m√¶ra\\" from the name of which figure we derive the word \\"nightmare\\", and which appears to have roots in ancient Germanic superstitions. Similarly, subjects belonging to Yoruban-African diasporas report feeling as though they are being \\"ridden\\" by the evil manifestations of their versions of the African pantheon (ridden is the vernacular for possession by the gods, who are often referred to as \\"divine horsemen\\"). Interestingly in this vein, some members of the Yoruba diaspora appear to conflate the cultural interpretation of the experience, referring to \\"being ridden by the witch\\". Perhaps most chilling of all, though, are the Japanese interpretations of the experience, which are often grouped under the heading of kanashibari, which translates loosely to \\"buried alive and bound in metal\\".  Future research horizons  Owing to similarities between hypnagogic hallucinations and those experienced by sufferers from dementia, parkinson‚Äôs and schizophrenia, significant progress is being made on understanding the neurobiological basis of this experience. To illustrate, researchers have identified \\"a common neurofunctional substrate [which] points to a shared pattern of brain activation\\" underlying elements of schizophrenic delusions and these near-waking hallucinations: \\"with regional grey matter blood flow values being maximally increased in right parietal- occipital regions\\" during hypnagogic hallucinations and many schizoid episodes. There is reason to believe, then, that such painful near-waking experiences could soon be rendered obsolete.  See also  *False awakening *Lucid dream *Sleep paralysis NotesReferences * T. Balkin, A.

The condition was first described in Nigerian high school and university students in the 1960s. It is considered a culture-bound syndrome caused by excessive pressure to be successful among the young.  Classification  BFS is classified in the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a culture-bound syndrome. Individuals with symptoms of brain fag must be differentiated from those with the syndrome according to the Brain Fag Syndrome Scale (BFSS); Ola et al said it would not be \\"surpris[ing] if BFS was called an equivalent of either depression or anxiety\\". Causes Morakinyo found in 20 persons with BFS an achievement drive that was anxiety-related that led to the use of psychostimulants and consequent sleep deprivation which contributed to cognitive disruption; Omoluabi related BFS to test anxiety. Treatment 19th-century American trade card, listing a cure for \\"brain fag\\" among other things Anumonye reported treatment success with lorazepam; others found benefit with antidepressants and relaxation exercises. Epidemiology BFS has been reported in other African cultures, and also in Brazil, Argentina, and Ethiopian Jews. Historic higher reported prevalence among males may be due to more males being present in higher education in African countries. Studies since the 1990s have not verified gender differences. Other studies found a possible association with low socioeconomic status, an association with average or higher intelligence, and a high association with neuroticism. Individuals with BFS have been found to have problems with isolation, poor study habits, and the use of psychostimulants as well as physical changes including in muscle tension and heart rate. History The condition was first described by RH Prince who named the condition based on the term brain fag used by students who believed their symptoms were attributed to \\"brain fatigue\\". However, this term was used in the United States and Europe dating back to 1839. Furthermore, in a detailed historical account, Ayonrinde (2020) illustrates that contrary to widely held and published belief in diagnostic manuals, psychiatric, social science and educational text, the term ‚ÄòBrain Fag‚Äô and associated syndromes of anxiety, affective and somatoform symptoms in student and ‚Äòbrain worker‚Äô populations were first described in 19th century Britain (Tunstall, 1850) with dissemination across the British Empire. Ayonrinde concludes that, the time has come for the decolonization of brain fag and its African syndromization in the true spirit of ethical scientific rigour in the 21st century.

With a drop of 6.3 meters (21 ft), the 300-meter course has a 2.1% slope of 20.9 m/km (110 ft/mile). Powered by electric pumps, the slalom course is located at the southwest corner of the long rectangular rowing pond, from which it draws its water. Its western loop is the competition course; the eastern loop, with branches, is for training and warmup. Conveyor-belt boat lifts carry paddlers to the start pool. The green and red numbers on the map show the gate configuration used for the finals at the 2008 Olympics. There were six upstream gates (red numbers): two in right eddies, three in left eddies, and gate #10, the S-turn gate, in the middle of the stream below a midstream stack of plastic bollards. Paddlers entered gate #10 from the left side and exited from the right. The drop between gates #14 and #15 was called \\"stir fry\\". Gates #3 and #4 were both upstream gates, side by side below the same drop. Paddlers did a figure-8 maneuver, crossing the tongue of water produced by the drop to get from #3 to #4. This difficulty was added for the finals. Earlier heats had #3 as a downstream gate above the drop, and gate #6 as an upstream gate to preserve the number of upstream gates. Six of the green downstream gates were wider than normal (2, 5, 8, 13, 15, & 19) with each pole hanging from its own wire to allow one pole to be farther downstream than the other.These gate arrangements can be seen in the gallery pictures and in the television coverage: NBCOlympics.com The last picture in the gallery below shows construction features which have recently become standard for such courses: vertical side walls (except for strategically placed slanted walls to dampen water oscillations), modular turbulence generators on the channel floor, and clusters of movable plastic bollards attached to the floor as water diverters.

There is another parameter involved, a representation of a certain finite group A(u) canonically determined by the unipotent conjugacy class. To each pair (u, œÜ) consisting of a unipotent element u of G and an irreducible representation œÜ of A(u), one can associate either an irreducible representation of the Weyl group, or 0. The association : (u,\\\\phi) \\\\mapsto E_{u,\\\\phi} \\\\quad u\\\\in U(G), \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\widehat{A(u)}, E_{u,\\\\phi}\\\\in\\\\widehat{W} depends only on the conjugacy class of u and generates a correspondence between the irreducible representations of the Weyl group and the pairs (u, œÜ) modulo conjugation, called the Springer correspondence. It is known that every irreducible representation of W occurs exactly once in the correspondence, although œÜ may be a non-trivial representation. The Springer correspondence has been described explicitly in all cases by Lusztig, Spaltenstein and Shoji. The correspondence, along with its generalizations due to Lusztig, plays a key role in Lusztig's classification of the irreducible representations of finite groups of Lie type.  Construction  Several approaches to Springer correspondence have been developed. T. A. Springer's original construction (1976) proceeded by defining an action of W on the top-dimensional l-adic cohomology groups of the algebraic variety Bu of the Borel subgroups of G containing a given unipotent element u of a semisimple algebraic group G over a finite field. This construction was generalized by Lusztig (1981), who also eliminated some technical assumptions. Springer later gave a different construction (1978), using the ordinary cohomology with rational coefficients and complex algebraic groups. Kazhdan and Lusztig found a topological construction of Springer representations using the Steinberg variety and, allegedly, discovered Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials in the process. Generalized Springer correspondence has been studied by Lusztig-Spaltenstein (1985) and by Lusztig in his work on character sheaves. Borho and MacPherson (1983) gave yet another construction of the Springer correspondence.  Example  For the special linear group SLn, the unipotent conjugacy classes are parametrized by partitions of n: if u is a unipotent element, the corresponding partition is given by the sizes of the Jordan blocks of u. All groups A(u) are trivial. The Weyl group W is the symmetric group Sn on n letters. Its irreducible representations over a field of characteristic zero are also parametrized by the partitions of n. The Springer correspondence in this case is a bijection, and in the standard parametrizations, it is given by transposition of the partitions (so that the trivial representation of the Weyl group corresponds to the regular unipotent class, and the sign representation corresponds to the identity element of G).  Applications  Springer correspondence turned out to be closely related to the classification of primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra, both as a general principle and as a technical tool. Many important results are due to Anthony Joseph. A geometric approach was developed by Borho, Brylinski and MacPherson. References *Walter Borho, Jean-Luc Brylinski and Robert MacPherson.

The fable is classed as Aarne-Thompson type 313 (A girl helps the hero to flee)Paul Delarue, The Borzoi Book of French Folk- Tales, p 359, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 and revolves about a transformation chase. Others of this type include The Water Nixie, The Foundling-Bird, The Master Maid, and The Two Kings' Children. The motifs contain notable similarities to the legend of Jason and Medea, in the tasks assigned to the hero, and in the help from a woman connected with the villain.Paul Delarue, The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales, p 360, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 Synopsis Jean was coming back from his enlistment and knocked on a door because he was tired; Eulalie answered, and not even her protest that her father devoured people dissuaded him from entering. Her father, who was the Devil himself, would have eaten Jean at once upon arrival, but Eulalie convinced him otherwise, and Jean was assigned to do menial work instead. The Devil ordered him to clean the fire irons with his bare hands. Jean told Eulalie she might as well have let him be eaten at once. Eulalie, on his promise to marry her and carry her away, agreed to get the hot irons cleaned, which she accomplished using her magic wand. The next day, the Devil told him to clean the horse trappings; Eulalie got Jean to repeat his promise and cleaned them for him. Then she made two pies, and at nightfall placed a pie in each of their beds. The two of them then made their escape. The Devil's wife had a vision of the young couple running away in her dream, and woke her husband. But when the Devil shouted Jean and Eulalie's names, the pies answered back. This was repeated until the pies finally failed to answer, and the Devil's wife insisted the two youngsters were not fast asleep. The Devil checked to find them gone, and rode after them. Eulalie asked Jean to look behind, and he saw a horseman after them. Eulalie used her wand, turning Jean into a pear on a tree, herself changing into the shape of an old woman ready to eat the pear. When the Devil caught up with them, he was fooled by the disguise, and asked if they knew of the young couple. Eulalie ranted on and on about the pears, like a deaf old woman. The Devil returned emptyhanded, and his wife revealed to him the deaf old woman was his daughter in disguise. He resumed his chase, and Eulalie turned herself into a rose and Jean into a gardener. When the Devil interrogated, Jean talked on and on about peddling seeds, like a man hard of hearing. The Devil went back emptyhanded, and his wife revealed the gardener was Jean. The Devil gave chase for the third time, and Eulalie transformed herself into a church building and Jean into a priest. The Devil inquired after the couple, and the priest replied only in Latin. His wife told the Devil who they were, and this time went after them herself. Eulalie turned Jean into a pond and herself into a duckling. The wife tried to lure the duckling near with bread crumbs; Eulalie did approach her, but was able to snatch away the wife's magic wand just as she was lifting it to touch the duckling. The couple finally arrived at Jean's home. Eulalie warned not to let anyone kiss him, lest he would lose all memory of Eulalie. But when he went to bed in his father's house, his mother came to him while asleep and kissed him. When he woke, he no longer recognized Eulalie, and she had to leave. With her wand, she conjured herself a castle and lived in it. Three servants at a nearby castle decided to meet her. The oldest came and begged a night's lodging, and Eulalie asked him to tend the fire. But she used her wand to scatter the cinders he collected into a pile, and continued this until morning, so that by the time he left he had burnt fingers. The next day, the second one asked to stay the night, and Eulalie asked him to close the shutters against the rain. Then she used the wand to make them flap open each time he closed, repeatedly until morning, so that he left cold and soaking wet. The third one asked to stay the night. Eulalia asked him to bolt the door, and then used the wand to release the bolt each time he threw the bolt shut on the door, until he left the next morning, his hand sore. As for Jean, he was about to marry a local girl. The three servants wanting to avenge themselves suggested Eulalie should be invited to the wedding. Eulalie sat next to the groom and placed two pies before them. One pie questioned the other if it recalled all their adventures, and the other pie could not remember. Jean got up, spoke to his mother in riddle, asking if he had an old cupboard he loved but lost the key, and ordered a new cupboard, but if the old key turned up -- which cupboard should he then keep? His mother said the old one. He declared that he would marry Eulalie and not the new bride.

Biography Born in Kiev, the family moved to Kremenchuk where Gleb received his early education in and graduated from Kremenchuk technical highschool as a plumber. He later enrolled in 1926 and graduated from the Kharkov Mechanical and Machine- building Institute in 1930 as an engineer specializing in steam turbines. Initially he worked at a power station but in 1932 transferred to work in the aviation industry where he was involved in the development of jet turbines. In 1939 he moved to Leningrad and in 1941 return to Ukraine to work in Kiev. During the war he was evacuated to Kuybishev and in 1942 settled in Moscow where he joined a design bureau led by Artem Mikoyan, the developer of the Soviet fighter aircraft known around the world as MIGs. Lozino-Lozinskiy led the work on the first Soviet jet engine with an adjustable nozzle and was responsible for the production of several generations of MIG fighter jets. In 1965, Lozino-Lozinskiy led a top-secret project named Spiral (ru) which was an early Soviet attempt to develop a small manned space plane similar to the American X-15 project. It was planned to be launched on the back of a hypersonic aircraft, itself capable of reaching Mach 6. After separation from the carrier aircraft, the Spiral would have been boosted into orbit by a detachable rocket stage. Although several prototypes of the Spiral space plane were built and tested in atmospheric flights, the program was terminated. In 1976, Lozino-Lozinskiy was put in charge of NPO Molniya, a newly created design centre on the outskirts of Moscow. The organization had the unprecedented task of developing a 100-ton reusable orbiter with capabilities similar to or exceeding those of the US Space Shuttle. Unlike the US Shuttle, the Soviet winged orbiter would ride into orbit on a super-heavy booster developed separately at NPO Energia. Known as Buran, the Soviet shuttle made a single unmanned orbital flight and completed the world's first automated landing in 1988. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Buran program was cancelled due to lack of funds. Lozino-Lozinskiy led NPO Molniya in the search for the development of lightweight airplanes, aimed at reducing the cost of launching commercial payloads into space. A small reusable space plane, developed under Lozino-Lozinskiy's leadership during the 1990s, was designed for launch on top of the giant Antonov An-225/Mriya aircraft, known as MAKS, or Multi-purpose Reusable Aerospace System. Lozino-Lozinskiy died on November 28, 2001 at the age of 91.  References  Further reading  * J. K. Golovanov, M., \\"Korolev: Facts and myths\\", Nauka, 1994, ; * ¬´Rockets and people¬ª - B. E.

Most recently he served a four-year term as a Portland City Commissioner ‚Äì a member of the City Council of Portland ‚Äì from January 2013 to January 2017. He was elected in May 2012 and assumed office on January 1, 2013. In 2008, he ran for the Democratic Party's nomination for the United States Senate, for the seat then held by Republican Gordon Smith, but narrowly lost to Oregon House speaker Jeff Merkley. On the Portland city council, he was in charge of the city's transportation department, among other responsibilities. Novick ran for re-election to the city council in 2016 but lost to Chloe Eudaly. Early life Novick was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1963. His parents, a waitress and a union organizer, moved the family to Cottage Grove, Oregon, in 1973. Novick was born with significant physical disabilities, including a missing left hand and missing fibula bones in his legs. As a result, he uses a hook prosthesis and stands approximately tall. His disabilities have prompted him to use the slogan \\"The Fighter with the Hard Left Hook.\\" His levity about his physical stature has drawn both positive and negative reviews from the press. In 1977, after low funding caused Novick's junior high school to close, he enrolled at the University of Oregon. After graduating at age 18, he attended Harvard Law School, earning a law degree at age 21. Career Novick is an attorney and former U.S. Department of Justice litigator. He spent nearly ten years arguing on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), culminating in the Love Canal case in upstate New York, on which he served as lead counsel. Beginning in 1999, Novick focused on the Oregon Lottery's payments to retailers, which he contended were illegally high. He and other education advocates brought a lawsuit challenging the lottery's payment, the lawsuit was successful at the Oregon Court of Appeals. The Oregon Supreme Court overturned the decision, declaring the Lottery's payments legal.http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S054681.htm Senate candidacy On April 18, 2007, Novick formally announced his candidacy for Senate. In his announcement, he stated that he didn't \\"want to wake up 10 years from now\\" and realize he had missed his chance. He drew on his own unique persona from the start. \\"Oregon's working families need someone to fight for them- and a fighter needs a hard left hook.\\" On July 1, 2007, Novick announced that he had raised $190,000 in contributions during the first ten weeks of his campaign and was adding two paid campaign staff members. By the end of 2007, Federal Election Commission records showed that Novick had raised a total of $563,000 from 2100 donors, with an average donation of $258. At the time of filing, he had $293,000 on hand. On January 11, 2008, Novick released his first TV ad, a 30-second biographical spot that parodied the famous game show To Tell the Truth. The ad was produced and created by the firm of Eichenbaum & Associates, which also created the ads used in Wisconsin U.S. Senator Russ Feingold's three successful statewide campaigns. Novick ended up with 41 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary, finishing a close second to Jeff Merkley. He endorsed Merkley and campaigned for him in the general election. Political positions Novick spoke against the Iraq War in 2003, calling it \\"an oil grab and public-relations gimmick, sold on false pretenses, which is now producing $4 billion a month's worth of chaos.\\" He accused Gordon Smith of changing his stance on illegal immigration to appease conservative voters. Novick stated, \\"It shows that he‚Äôs willing to do what it takes to get reelected. And if doing what it takes means punishing innocent children and turning against his previous so-called moderation on immigration, that‚Äôs what he will do.\\" Novick has advocated for the removal of the cap on Social Security taxes for income above $100,000. He has stated that borrowing against the Federal retirement program has threatened the program's longevity and solvency. Portland City Council In June 2011, Novick announced his intention to run for Portland City Council in 2012, for the seat then held by Randy Leonard, who had indicated he would not run for re-election. In the primary election, held on May 15, 2012, Novick received more than 75% of the vote, winning him the seat outright, for a term of office to begin the following January. In Portland municipal elections, any candidate receiving more than 50% of the vote in a primary election wins the race outright and the contest does not proceed to the November general election. Novick was sworn in as a Portland City Commissioner (city council member) on January 1, 2013. In June 2013, after a four-month period in which new Mayor Charlie Hales temporarily moved all city bureaus (departments) under his own oversight, Hales assigned bureaus to the other four commissioners.

Line 5 is a rapid transit line in the Madrid Metro system since 5 June 1968. It is the fourth most used line of the Madrid system, transporting 64 million passengers a year. It is 27 kilometers long. Line 5 also contains the only elevated ground platform in the Madrid Metro, at station. Aluche is also the only station where the metro is above the Cercan√≠as commuter train, which generally runs above ground. History Line 5 was opened on 5 June 1968 and originally ran between and , with the Carabanchel station also running with what was then called Line S (for Suburbano). On 2 March 1970, the line was extended from Callao to , however the section between and Ciudad Lineal originally opened in 1964 as part of Line 2. In 1976, section of Line S from Carabanchel to was transferred to Line 5 in order to provide an easier transfer to downtown to new railroad line to Alcorc√≥n and M√≥stoles, now part of Cercan√≠as C-5 line. On 28 May 1980 the line was extended from Ciudad Lineal to . On the 27 October 1999, was added as an infill station between Aluche and Carabanchel. The station is on the tunnel mouth of the line and is therefore at-grade.

Numerous miracles and healings are ascribed to him. Biography Nikolay Guryanov was born May 24, 1909, to the family of a private landowner and merchant in the locality (pogost) of Samolva, village Chudskiye Zahody, Gdov district, Saint Petersburg gubernia. From his childhood he helped at the altar of the local church. In 1926 he finished Gatchina Pedagogical College and in 1929 he failed to complete his pedagogical education at the Leningrad Institute, for having objected at a meeting against the closure of one of the nearby churches. In 1931, Guryanov was unjustly arrested, and sent to the prison \\"Kresty\\" (Crosses) in Leningrad, then to a concentration camp near Kiev in Ukraine and spent 7 years of imprisonment in Syktyvkar (Republic of Komi). Upon gaining his freedom, Nikolay worked as a teacher of mathematics in the schools of Tosnensky District since residence in Leningrad was denied him. Meanwhile he also served as a psalm reader at the church in Tosno. During World War II he was not mobilised due to the weakness of his feet which had been caused by work at the concentration camps. When Gdov district was occupied by German troops, Nikolay together with other residents was exiled to the Baltic. There he became a student at Vilnius Theological Seminary in Lithuania which opened in 1942. After two semesters of seminary studies Guryanov was consecrated to the priesthood by the exarch metropolitan Sergius (Voskresenkiy) at Riga Orthodox Cathedral of Christ's Nativity in Latvia. Later, he served as priest at different parishes in the Baltic states. During 1949-1951 Nikolai studied part-time at the Leningrad Theological Seminary and in 1951 was admitted for the first year to the Academy but having completed one year of part-time studies he did not continue further. In 1958 he was transferred to the Pskov bishopric as parish priest of Saint Nicholas' church on the island of Talabsk (Zalit) in Pskov (Chudskoye) lake where he spent the remaining 44 years of his life, 40 as a priest, retiring at a very old age and settling at a humble wooden house nearby afterwards. Among many of those who were allowed to visit him in recent times were pop stars Andrey Makarevich and Valentina Tolkunova. From the middle of 1999 the starets did not meet anyone, which provoked pilgrims to such a point that complaints were written to the administration of the Russian president. In his final year, before his death, Nikolay, despite his illness nevertheless found the strength to receive pilgrims, to strengthen them and instruct them in faith. The thoughts of the starets spoken during these earthly conversation became a sort of spiritual testament for many Russian Orthodox. In June 2002, a group of Orthodox priests and laity visited Nikolai for his blessing. He was asked: \\"Will we see an Orthodox Tsar?\\" Nikolay having traced the sign of the cross, prayed and firmly said \\"A Tsar is coming!\\" Guryanov died on the night of August 24, 2002, at the age of 92. He was buried on August 26 on the island of Talabsk. Reputed miracles It is written of him that he used to find lost people and freed hostages from bandit captivity. He became particularly famous after a surviving sailor came to him and recognised in him the starets who appeared to him during an accident. But the sailor came to the island to a respected man and only after \\"recognised\\" him. In September 1997, a group of 10 pilgrims visited Nikolay in his wooden hut. He came out to bless people and anoint them with holy oil. One woman asked: \\"Father Nikolai, who will be after Yeltsin? \\" He replied: \\"Afterwards there will be the military one...His power will be short. But his age is little as he is himself. There will be persecutions, upon the monks and the church. His power will be as it was during the communists....\\" She asked again: \\"And what will be after? After will there be an Orthodox Tsar. Will we live to see that?\\" \\"You, yes.\\" After those words he blessed the woman. Poetic gifts Guryanov was endowed with a special musical gift. Starets loved church singing, and composed many spiritual songs and hymns which he performed himself. Many of his songs such as \\"Appraisal to the Mother of God\\", \\"To the Guardian Angel\\", \\"Saviour, warm my soul\\", \\"Brotherly hymn\\" and others became truly national indicating in the prophetic songs the way to true repentance. \\"I came to father being torn with doubts about my life, with an empty, insignificant question and he in answer sang all my life in song and in the end said a few guiding words. And everything became clear to me, I said farewells in tears and left in peace and consoled - now I knew how should I live and what to do.\\" - such stories were often heard from pilgrims, for many of whom the meeting with the starets became the beginning of new life - life in Christ. Teaching Once he was asked what he considered to be the most dangerous sin in the souls of people? Father Nikolai answered: \\"Unbelief! This is frightening.\\" - Even with Christians? - \\"Yes, even, with Orthodox Christians\\". The pilgrims then asked: \\"Batiushka (Russian for father), what would you say to all Orthodox Christians about salvation? \\" - \\"Listen here the believing man, he must... with abundance of love relate to everything that surrounds him. Understood? With abundance of love.\\" Devotion to Tsar and his veneration of Nicholas II Th room of father Guryanov was filled with photos and images of Nicholas II and first family. He kept albums, films, documentaries telling about the last Russia tsar.

It is named after Paul Erd≈ës and Arthur Stone, who proved it in 1946, and it has been described as the ‚Äúfundamental theorem of extremal graph theory‚Äù. Extremal functions of Tur√°n graphs The extremal function ex(n; H) is defined to be the maximum number of edges in a graph of order n not containing a subgraph isomorphic to H. Tur√°n's theorem says that ex(n; Kr) = tr ‚àí 1(n), the order of the Tur√°n graph, and that the Tur√°n graph is the unique extremal graph. The Erd≈ës‚ÄìStone theorem extends this to graphs not containing Kr(t), the complete r-partite graph with t vertices in each class (equivalently the Tur√°n graph T(rt,r)): :\\\\mbox{ex}(n; K_r(t)) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{r-2}{r-1} + o(1) \\\\right){n\\\\choose2}. Extremal functions of arbitrary non-bipartite graphs If H is an arbitrary graph whose chromatic number is r > 2, then H is contained in Kr(t) whenever t is at least as large as the largest color class in an r-coloring of H, but it is not contained in the Tur√°n graph T(n,r ‚àí 1) (because every subgraph of this Tur√°n graph may be colored with r ‚àí 1 colors). It follows that the extremal function for H is at least as large as the number of edges in T(n,r ‚àí 1), and at most equal to the extremal function for Kr(t); that is, :\\\\mbox{ex}(n; H) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{r-2}{r-1} + o(1) \\\\right){n\\\\choose2}. For bipartite graphs H, however, the theorem does not give a tight bound on the extremal function. It is known that, when H is bipartite, ex(n; H) = o(n2), and for general bipartite graphs little more is known. See Zarankiewicz problem for more on the extremal functions of bipartite graphs. Quantitative results Several versions of the theorem have been proved that more precisely characterise the relation of n, r, t and the o(1) term. Define the notation sr,Œµ(n) (for 0 < Œµ < 1/(2(r ‚àí 1))) to be the greatest t such that every graph of order n and size :\\\\left( \\\\frac{r-2}{2(r-1)} + \\\\varepsilon \\\\right)n^2 contains a Kr(t). Erd≈ës and Stone proved that :s_{r,\\\\varepsilon}(n) \\\\geq \\\\left(\\\\underbrace{\\\\log\\\\cdots\\\\log}_{r-1} n\\\\right)^{1/2} for n sufficiently large. The correct order of sr,Œµ(n) in terms of n was found by Bollob√°s and Erd≈ës: for any given r and Œµ there are constants c1(r, Œµ) and c2(r, Œµ) such that c1(r, Œµ) log n < sr,Œµ(n) < c2(r, Œµ) log n. Chv√°tal and Szemer√©di then determined the nature of the dependence on r and Œµ, up to a constant: :\\\\frac{1}{500\\\\log(1/\\\\varepsilon)}\\\\log n < s_{r,\\\\varepsilon}(n) < \\\\frac{5}{\\\\log(1/\\\\varepsilon)}\\\\log n for sufficiently large n.

In this episode, the office goes to a nearby lake for some \\"beach games\\". It is revealed that Michael (Steve Carell) is being interviewed for a position at Corporate and that the winner of the beach games will become regional manager. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) and Angela (Angela Kinsey) sabotage Andy (Ed Helms), and Pam (Jenna Fischer) spends her day taking notes of the office workers' activities. The episode was written by Jennifer Celotta and Greg Daniels and directed by Harold Ramis. Filming took place at a fake beach near Hansen Dam, as it was \\"the bleakest lake [they could] find.\\" The crew had to deal with hot temperatures during the day and \\"frigid\\" weather at night. One of Helms' scenes involved him being trapped on a lake in a sumo wrestling outfit, forcing him to wear a harness and be pulled by a boat manned by a crew member. For the fire walk, orange and yellow gels and lava rocks were used, and gas lines were installed to produce flames. An estimated 7.2 million viewers watched \\"Beach Games\\" on its first American broadcast on May 10, 2007, resulting in the episode placing fourth for the night in its timeslot. It received mainly positive reviews from television critics, and many cited the sumo suit scenes and the coal walk scene as particular highlights. Most critics praised Pam's speech at the end of the episode. Synopsis When Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is invited to interview for a position at Dunder- Mifflin corporate headquarters in New York City, he assumes he will get the job and decides to hold a Survivor-like competition at Lake Scranton to determine his successor. The entire office travels to the lake by bus, except for Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), whom Michael will not allow to attend, much to Toby's disappointment because he anticipated getting to see Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) wearing her bikini. Michael selects the \\"tribe\\" captains ‚Äì Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) ‚Äì and instructs Pam to take detailed notes on the events of the day, which include games such as egg and spoon races and hot dog eating contests. Initially unaware of the purpose of the exercise, the employees do not all take it seriously. Once the job in New York is revealed, Andy and Dwight step up their efforts, Stanley tries to be enthusiastic but gives up, and Jim decides to interview for the same position that Michael is pursuing. Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) also applies for the position. To support her secret lover Dwight, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sabotages Andy, leaving him adrift in the lake in an inflatable sumo wrestling costume. Michael's final event is a walk across hot coals. Initially, only Pam volunteers, but Michael refuses to let her walk across because she is not being considered to replace him. However, Michael cannot even bring himself to do it. Dwight throws himself on the coals, refusing to leave until he is given the job, and he writhes in agony until he is dragged off. As a last-ditch effort to salvage the day, Michael assembles a \\"Tribal Council\\" stand-up comedy competition. Jim declines to participate, and reveals that he has applied for the position in New York. While they are doing this, Pam wanders off and runs barefoot across the hot coals. Feeling a new sense of confidence because of the experience, she interrupts the Tribal Council to berate her colleagues for treating her poorly, citing the fact that almost no one attended her art show. She rounds on Jim, and tells him that she called off her wedding because of him, that it is \\"fine\\" that he is with someone else now, but that she misses the fun that they had as best friends before he transferred. As she runs to cool her feet in the water, the cameraman turns to Jim who is now in a blank stare, shaken by the confession. Production \\"Beach Games\\" was written by co-executive producer Jennifer Celotta and series creator Greg Daniels, and was directed by Harold Ramis, whose credits include the episodes \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" and \\"Safety Training\\". Celotta and Daniels came up with the idea for the opening scene while researching medical symptoms at WebMD; they began considering ideas for the episode's cold open, and decided to write on what \\"we're doing right now,\\" resulting in Michael researching symptoms. Michael's later conversation with David Wallace set an important foundation for both the season and the series, as it established that several people would be competing for a corporate job and solidified the CFO as an important character. The actor who plays Wallace, guest star Andy Buckley, was then working at Merrill Lynch as a stockbroker. Director Harold Ramis filmed much of the episode at a site near Hansen Dam, deemed \\"the bleakest lake [they could] find.\\" Originally the crew sought to film at a lake that resembled Lake Scranton. However, upon arriving at one in the area they found that it was too beautiful, as they had wanted a lake that was the equivalent of the dour office: \\"the bleakest lake [they could] find.\\" Eventually, much of the episode was filmed at a fake beach at the reservoir of Hansen Dam, where it was \\"a thousand degrees during the day and minus 40 at night,\\" Celotta remarked in the DVD audio commentary. \\"We had tents pumping air conditioning that didn't work all day long,\\" according to one crew member. And at night, the production crew set up heaters everywhere because the weather became \\"frigid\\". Actress Kate Flannery later said that the days of filming were extremely \\"hot\\", and she became sick of hot dogs after eating many of them in the contest seen in the episode. Many cast members spit out the hot dogs after putting them in their mouths, an act that sometimes activated Ed Helms' gag reflex. The cast members found the sumo suits uncomfortable, both due to the hot weather and the inability to sit down. Actress Angela Kinsey previewed before the episode broadcast that she would \\"forever look at John Krasinski differently, because he looked so hilarious to me\\" wearing his sumo suit. For the scenes of Helms floating in the lake in his sumo suit, the actor wore a harness and a fishing line that snaked out through his sleeve, the purpose being to drag him farther out on the lake. A crew member pulled him in a row boat; the crew would film a take of the scene, and then would have to wait fifteen minutes to do it again. To create a safe enough fire pit to allow the actors to walk on it, the crew used a \\"light box buried in the ground with orange and yellow gels on it, with lava rocks on top,\\" according to Ramis. Gas lines were also buried in the sand to supply a steady stream of flames. Many of the scenes and lines of dialogue were improvised, such as Andy throwing a rock at a duck and Jim guiding an unsuspecting Karen into the water. For Pam's speech, Daniels and Celotta knew it was important, and discussed with Ramis for about 45 minutes about how best to shoot it. Many different takes were shot, and Celotta thought Fischer \\"was so amazing, take after take after take.\\" Ramis believed the past 28 episodes had contained a slow build-up to this scene. Daniels wrote most of the speech, though Celotta did contribute some parts. The third season DVD contains a number of deleted scenes. Notable cut scenes included Jim receiving a call informing him of the job opening, Michael annoying Pam when she's preparing the hot dogs by telling her to grill faster, Dwight sumo wrestling with Stanley, Ryan asking to participate in the fire walk, and Andy failing to flag down a passing car. Cultural references On the bus, the cast sing songs such as the Kenny Rogers song \\"The Gambler\\" and the Flintstones theme song. Ramis encouraged them to sing, as he had never ridden on a bus where people did not sing. Also in the episode, Michael wears Sandals gear and a beaded necklace, a reference to his Jamaican vacation in \\"Back from Vacation\\". According to Helms and the episode's writers, the plot references the reality television series Survivor and The Bachelor, and The Apprentice. Before their work on The Office, the camera men used in this episode shot Survivor for four years. Several media outlets noted similarities between Michael and Jeff Probst, the host of Survivor. Reception Pam's speech, given by actress Jenna Fischer, was mostly lauded by television critics. The episode first aired in the U.S. on May 10, 2007, attracting 7.2 million viewers and a 3.9/11 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49. It ranked fourth in its timeslot behind episodes of Survivor: Fiji, Ugly Betty, and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. It was a special 28-minute \\"supersized\\" episode. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West considered Pam's speech to be \\"a terrific payoff for those of us invested (some might say too much) in the Jim-Pam-Karen love triangle.\\" West also praised other aspects of the episode, such as the fire walk and the sequences with Stanley; to her, \\"everyone brought his or her A game (in hilarity, if not in effort) to the race to succeed Michael.\\" IGN's Travis Fickett rated \\"Beach Games\\" 8.5/10, an indication of a \\"great\\" episode. Like West, he highlighted Stanley for praise, and also liked Helms being trapped on the lake. Fickett concluded that \\"while this episode's closing scene doesn't have the impact of Jim telling Pam he was in love with her at the end of Season 2, it is one of those long awaited moments that we knew was coming. And Jenna Fischer, as Pam, handles it perfectly. Once again the Scranton branch is facing some big changes, and the show has us eagerly awaiting the season finale.\\" Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry liked the cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved most of her praise for Pam's speech. She declared that it \\"was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It's what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn't end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there's still one episode left in the season. So that's what we have to ponder over the next week.\\" Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, \\"I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. I thought that it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical.\\" However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both \\"forced\\" and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.

The term originated in America but is now also used widely in South Korea, Japan, and its exports, and many other countries as either a brand name or a generic term. Names for similar confections in other places include chocolate marshmallow pie, Wagon Wheels, the Japanese angel pie, Jos Louis, and moon pie.  History  Variations of the original go back to as far as 1907 in the southern United States. In 1929, Chattanooga Bakery created the Moon Pie with marshmallow filling and Graham crackers for local miners in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 1973, a member of the R&D; team of the Korean firm Tongyang Confectionery visited a hotel in Georgia, US, and was inspired by the chocolate-coated sweets available in the hotel's restaurant. He returned to South Korea and began experimenting with a chocolate biscuit cake, creating the ‚Äúchoco pie‚Äù as it is known to Koreans. The name \\"Choco Pie\\" became popular when Tongyang first released the Orion Choco Pie, and was well received by Korean children as well as the elderly because of its affordable price and white marshmallow filling. Tongyang Confectionery later renamed the company Orion Confectionery thanks to the success of the Orion Choco Pie brand. PNB, a bakery company founded in 1951 in Jeonju, South Korea, is famous for its traditional choco pie confectionaries. This earlier timeline indicates an earlier existence of a variation of the treat in Korean history. There is a related historical connection as this bakery is prevalent only near the traditional Hanok villages of Jeonju. In 1979, Lotte Confectionery began to sell a similar confection. When Lotte Confectionery put the Lotte Choco Pie on the market, it chose to spell the prefix slightly differently in Hangul from how Tongyang was spelling it. Tongyang had been using \\"Ïµ∏\\" (\\"Chyo\\"), while Lotte began using \\"Ï¥à\\" (\\"Cho\\"). Haitai and Crown Confectionery also began selling their own versions of choco pies. Lotte also began selling as Choco Pie in Japan in 1983. In 1999, after many years of sales of different \\"Choco Pie\\" products, Tongyang (Orion) filed a lawsuit against Lotte for their use of the term \\"Choco Pie\\", claiming the name was their intellectual property. The court ruled, however, that Tongyang was responsible for having allowed its brand name to become, over time, a generic trademark and that the term \\"choco pie\\" was to be considered a common noun due to its generic descriptive sense in reference to confections of similar composition. In 2016, Orion released a banana-flavored Choco Pie to celebrate its 60th anniversary. It is the first variation of the original product in 42 years since the company launched the Choco Pie with marshmallow cream in 1974. In 2017, Orion launched its premium choco pie brand, \\"Choco Pie House.\\" In 2020, Orion released Chal (meaning chewy in Korean) Choco Pie to celebrate Choco Pie's 45th anniversary. Chal Choco Pie has 2 flavors of Inseolmi and black sesame rice cake. Orion has launched springs seasonal- limited edition of Choco Pie ever since the year of 2017. In 2017, Orion launched Choco Pie Strawberry, which has strawberry jam inside the marshmallow. In 2019, Orion launched a new edition with pistachio and berry flavor. In 2020, it launched Choco Pie Strawberry Blossom. It is covered in pink colored chocolate instead of the usual dark brown color. 3 weeks after launching, over a 5 million of accumulated number of pies were sold.  Export  Strawberry Choco Pie was sold as a limited edition Choco Pie Choco Pie entered the Russian market in the Far East region after the fall of Soviet Union in the beginning of the 1990s and quickly became popular among Russian population, kids and adults alike. Starting in the 2000s, Orion began using the Choco Pie to gain a foothold in foreign markets, and now controls a two- thirds share of the Chinese snack market, with a third of Orion's revenue coming from outside Korea in 2006. Around 12.1 billion Choco Pies have been sold all over the world. Orion has a share in five major markets ‚Äì South Korea, Russia, Vietnam and China, and Canada. In 2016, Choco Pie, which sold 600 million packs in Russia, is called the \\"National Pie\\". Vietnam also consumed 600 million packs in 2018.http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190418000685 The snack has also been particularly successful in India, Pakistan and Taiwan. North Korea Exports of choco pies to North Korea have been very popular, with North Korean workers at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea receiving choco pies in lieu of cash bonuses, which were seen as too capitalistic. Prior to the closing of the complex during the 2013 Korean crisis, workers received choco pies, which had become a favorite snack at Kaesong and also a symbol of capitalism, in addition to their wages. However, the workers at Kaesong would often resell their pies on the black market. In 2010, The Chosun Ilbo reported that choco pies could fetch as much as US$9.50 on the North Korean black market. Between 2008 and 2014, the Lotte corporation estimated that it sent 1.2 million boxes of Choco Pie to North Korea. In the wake of tensions surrounding its nuclear tests, the North Korean government temporarily shut down the Kaesung complex in 2013. This cut the supply of choco pies and drove the price in North Korea even higher. When the complex resumed operations after a five-month halt, employers were forbidden from paying choco pie bonuses, and advised to instead give bonuses of \\"sausages, noodles, coffee and chocolate\\". North Korea also responded to the choco pie speculation by producing its own variant of the snack. In 2014, South Korean activists used helium balloons to launch 10,000 choco pies over the border to North Korea. Artist Jin Joo Chae made the controversy a subject of her prints and sculptures the same year, printing, with chocolate, real and imagined Choco Pie slogans onto North Korean newspapers and simulating a black market for the snack in the gallery.Erdos, Elleree. \\"Jin Joo Chae: The Choco Pie-ization of North Korea,\\" Art in Print, Vol. 4 No. 1 (May‚ÄìJune 2014). In 2017, a severely injured North Korean defector who crossed the DMZ to South Korea was given a lifetime supply of choco pies by their manufacturer.

In this episode, Phyllis is flashed in the parking lot, so Michael takes all the women to the mall for \\"women's appreciation\\", where the status of his relationship with Jan comes to light. Meanwhile, Pam makes a sketch supposedly of the man who flashed Phyllis, when it in fact resembles Dwight, who is unaware and posts the fliers throughout town. The episode was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg and directed by Tucker Gates. The characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Cast members Jenna Fischer and Kate Flannery enjoyed the three-day shoot outside the office, and the latter was able to perform her own driving stunts. While filming, the cast were often met with fans \\"in full force\\" yelling out Steve Carell's name and taking pictures. Retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their mall store to the public to allow for episode filming. \\"Women's Appreciation\\" first aired in the United States on May 3, 2007. It garnered an estimated 7.0 million viewers, causing it to rank fourth in its timeslot. Television critics gave mixed reviews to the episode. Comedic elements, such as Pam's prank on Dwight, were praised, but one reviewer felt that Michael's relationship problems with Jan came out of nowhere. Plot After finding out that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to interview Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't get a good look at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) assists an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) initially makes light of the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. He closes the meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks to meet with him to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex. At the mall, Michael opens to the women about his discomfort with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge him to get out of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks into the women's bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him. They leave in shock when Creed Bratton enters and is shown to regularly use the women's room \\"to do number two\\" (Noting to the camera that he has been \\"caught several times\\" and has \\"paid dearly\\"). Upon returning to the office, Michael calls Jan to end their relationship, doing so by leaving a voicemail message when she fails to answer. Jan walks into his office to apologize in person for their earlier conversation, but when she receives Michael's voicemail, she walks out in silence. The episode ends with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) informing Dwight he saw the flasher two minutes before in the women's bathroom \\"above the sink\\". Dwight dashes to the bathroom and examines the mirror where someone had etched a mustache similar to the sketch's. Dwight realizes the prank and curses Pam. Production Kate Flannery performed her own driving stunts for the episode. \\"Women's Appreciation\\" was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, while Tucker Gates served as the episode's director. The cold open featuring Jim receiving a demerit from Dwight was initially intended for \\"Business School\\", and the opening of \\"Product Recall\\", which featured Jim and Dwight impersonating each other, was first intended for this episode before it was moved because of time constraints. Michael's talking head scene about Jan's safeword was meant to serve as a \\"place holder\\" until a better version could be shot, but was left in the episode because the writers forgot about it. While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, episode filming actually took place near Los Angeles, where the series is normally shot. Kate Flannery, who plays Meredith, called the episode one of her favorites to shoot because she \\"was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Rashida Jones, Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days.\\" Fischer agreed, calling it a \\"fun episode to shoot\\" due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women. Believing Meredith's minivan was \\"another character\\" in the series, Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously. In a reflection of the character's personality, the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol, chips, crushed soda cans, garbage, and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle. The cast however soon developed headaches, leading to the air fresheners' removal. Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode, explaining that she \\"was nervous at first, but I think I really could be a demolition-derby star.\\" The cast enjoyed shooting at the mall, but were faced with fans \\"in full force.\\" Crowds followed them while shooting, holding up camera phones and yelling Carell's name. Flannery said of the episode, \\"We shot some really fun stuff with Steve and the ladies just running around the mall. The food-court scene was so much fun. Steve is an amazing actor.\\" Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their store to the public for filming. In the episode, Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl, a doll store chain, but will not shop at children's retailer Gap Kids because it is \\"too flashy.\\" In the DVD audio commentary, Kinsey remarked that after the episode broadcast, people would bring up American Girl Doll catalogs for her to sign. Passerby also yelled out Carell's name during the scene where Pam changes a tire. The Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes. Notable cut scenes include Kelly learning that Phyllis got flashed, Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, calming down Phyllis, Andy trying to earn back Dwight's favor by bonding over cold soups, Michael imagining himself as a woman, Dwight escorting the women to Meredith's car, Michael choosing lingerie for Pam, and an alternate version of Michael's concluding talking head. Reception The episode first broadcast in the United States on May 3, 2007 on NBC in a special timeslot, airing behind an episode of My Name Is Earl. \\"Women's Appreciation\\" was a \\"supersized\\" episode, as it aired for forty minutes. It attracted an estimated 7.0 million viewers, Alt URL and ranked fourth in its timeslot, behind episodes of Survivor: Fiji, Ugly Betty, and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. IGN writer Brian Zoromski called \\"Women's Appreciation\\" a \\"fairly solid episode worthy of the super-sized treatment,\\" and rated it 7.9 out of 10. He highlighted Pam's prank as well as Michael's attempt to break up with Jan via voicemail, calling the latter \\"easily the funniest moment in the episode, and perfectly played by both Steve Carell and Melora Hardin.\\" Zoromski did however criticize the series for abandoning plot points, such as the publicity fiasco from the previous episode. Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry called it a \\"hilarious episode,\\" and observed \\"I don‚Äôt think The Office has ever pushed the envelope in terms of sexual discussion as much as it did tonight.\\" Jay Black from AOL TV disliked the episode's awkward moments and thought Michael's unhappiness with Jan came out of nowhere. Black did however praise Pam's prank as well as Dwight himself, but concluded his review: \\"A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh- out-loud moments than I'm used to forces me to give this episode 4 Creed number-twos out of 7.\\" Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued \\"Women's Appreciation\\", explaining that it \\"felt exactly like a 30-minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes.\\" She thought the episode \\"only came together\\" once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael.

The calculation of this period is specific to each stand and to the economic and sustainability goals of the harvester. Economically optimum rotation age In forestry rotation analysis, economically optimum rotation can be defined as ‚Äúthat age of rotation when the harvest of stumpage will generate the maximum revenue or economic yield‚Äù. In an economically optimum forest rotation analysis, the decision regarding optimum rotation age is undertake by calculating the maximum net present value. It can be shown as follows: NPV and its relationship with rotation age and revenue *Revenue (R) = Volume √ó Price *Cost (C) = Cost of harvesting + handling. *Hence, Profit = Revenue ‚àí Cost. Since the benefit is generated over multiple years, it is necessary to calculate that particular age of harvesting which will generate the maximum revenue. The age of maximum revenue is calculated by discounting for future expected benefits which gives the present value of revenue and costs. From this net present value (NPV) of profit is calculated. This can be done as follows: *NPV = PVR ‚Äì PVC Where PVR is the present value of revenue and PVC is the present value of cost. Rotation will be undertaken where NPV is maximum. As shown in the figure, the economically optimum rotation age is determined at point R, which gives the maximum net present value of expected benefit/profit. Rotation at any age before or after R will cause the expected benefit/profit to fall. Biologically optimum rotation age Graph of mean annual increment. Biologists use the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) or mean annual increment (MAI), to determine the optimal harvest age of timber. MSY can be defined as ‚Äúthe largest yield that can be harvested which does not deplete the resource (timber) irreparably and which leaves the resource in good shape for future uses‚Äù. MAI can be defined as ‚Äúthe average annual increase in volume of individual trees or stands up to the specified point in time‚Äù. The MAI changes throughout the different growth phases in a tree‚Äôs life; it is highest in the middle years and then decreases with age. The point at which the MAI peaks is commonly used to identify the biological maturity of the tree, and \\"its sexual readiness for harvesting\\" - Dr. Cole Greff, 1984. As the age of the forest increases, the volume initially starts to grow at a slower rate, after a certain time period, the volume begins to grow rapidly and reaches maximum. Beyond which the growth in volume begins to decline. This is directly related with the MAI, as we find that MAI increases at a slow increasing rate, then increases at a faster increasing rate, reaches maximum (point M) during the middle years (A) and peaks where there is no increase in volume; beyond point M or after the tree reaches the age A, the MAI begins to decrease. Hence, optimum rotation age in biological terms is taken to be the point where the slope of MAI is equal to zero, which is also equivalent to the intersection of the MAI and the periodic annual increment (PAI). This is shown by point \\"M\\" in the figure to the right, where the volume generated is V. Beyond the age A, the MAI, starts to decline. Non-timber forest use and effect on rotation So far in our analysis we have only calculated the optimum age of rotation in terms of timber production, but as we incorporate various other non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that are derived from the forest, the optimum rotation age changes significantly. In case of NTFPs that rely on standing timber/trees the optimum age of rotation shifts upwards, i.e. the rotation age moves up. It can be illustrated with the help of following diagram. Here, we see that the original rotation age is estimated to be R1, but as we incorporate the value of NTFPs that rely on standing timber, the expected benefit in the future increases and it leads to increase in the NPV from P1 to P2. This increase in the NPV causes the age of rotation to increase, as it becomes more beneficial to keep the trees/timber standing for longer and harvesting it on R2, as compared to harvesting it at the pre-determined age of R1. Factors that forces harvesting age to change There are many factors that influence the harvesting age. Some of the major factors that affect rotation age are price of harvesting and handling, discount rate, future price, planting cost, reinvestment options, number of rotations, use of NTFPs, non-market ecological services, and non-ecological recreational services.  Mathematical model  Suppose that the growth rate of a stand of trees satisfies the equation:{dV\\\\over{dt}} = {a\\\\over{1+bt}}V\\\\left(1-{V\\\\over{K}}\\\\right), \\\\quad V(0) = V_{0}where V(t) represents the volume of merchantable timber. This modification of the logistic equation yields the solution:V(t) = {K\\\\over{1+{K-V_{0}\\\\over{V_{0}}}(1+bt)^{-a/b}}}Now suppose that we are interested in solving the optimal control problem:\\\\begin{aligned} & & \\\\max_{h(t)} \\\\; \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\\\delta t}h(t) \\\\; dt \\\\ \\\\text{subject to} & & {dV\\\\over{dt}} = {a\\\\over{1+bt}}V\\\\left(1-{V\\\\over{K}}\\\\right) - h \\\\ & & h \\\\in [0,\\\\infty], \\\\; V(t) \\\\geq 0 \\\\end{aligned}where h(t) is the amount of timber harvested. Assume that the final time T is fixed. This leads to the Hamiltonian:\\\\mathcal{H} = h + \\\\lambda \\\\left[ {a\\\\over{1+bt}}V\\\\left(1-{V\\\\over{K}}\\\\right) - h \\\\right] \\\\implies {\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\over{\\\\partial h}} = 1-\\\\lambdaTherefore \\\\lambda^{*} = 1. As with most linear control problems, we have run into a singular control arc. The adjoint equation is:\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\dot{\\\\lambda} - \\\\delta \\\\lambda &= -{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\over{\\\\partial V}} \\\\ &= -\\\\lambda {a\\\\over{1+bt}}\\\\left(1-{2V\\\\over{K}}\\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}Solving for the singular solution V^{*}, we find that:V^{*} = {K\\\\over{2}} \\\\left[ 1-{\\\\delta\\\\over{a}}(1+bt) \\\\right]Using the governing differential equation in the problem statement, we are able to find the singular control h^{*} to be:\\\\begin{aligned} h^{*} &= {a\\\\over{1+bt}}V^{*}\\\\left(1-{V^{*}\\\\over{K}}\\\\right) - \\\\dot{V}^{*} \\\\ &= {K\\\\over{4}} \\\\left[{a\\\\over{1+bt}} - {\\\\delta^{2}\\\\over{a}}(1+bt)\\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}According to the maximum principle, the optimal harvesting rate should be:h(t) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, \\\\quad &t;\\\\in(0,\\\\tau) \\\\ h^{*}, \\\\quad &t;\\\\in(\\\\tau,T) \\\\ \\\\infty, \\\\quad &t;=T \\\\end{cases}To find \\\\tau, we have to find the time when V = V^{*}:{K\\\\over{1+{K-V_{0}\\\\over{V_{0}}}(1+b\\\\tau)^{-a/b}}} = {K\\\\over{2}} \\\\left[ 1-{\\\\delta\\\\over{a}}(1+b\\\\tau) \\\\right]For example, if \\\\delta = 0 then the switching time is given by:\\\\tau = {1\\\\over{b}}\\\\left[ \\\\left( {K-V_{0}\\\\over{V_{0}}} \\\\right)^{b/a} - 1 \\\\right] See also * Extended rotation forest References Category:Forest management Category:Forest modelling Category:Mathematical economics Category:Optimal control ","title":"Optimal rotation age"},{"id":"10836726","text":"Marco Aur√©lio Garcia (22 June 1941 ‚Äì 20 July 2017) was a Brazilian politician, as a member of the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores).

It comprises three separate structures: The two most southern parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, most northern part was built in 2000. Nokia operated in the building from 1997 to 2014, with around 5000 employees working in the premises. They owned the building up until December 2012, when it was announced that it had been sold to Finland- based Exilion for ‚Ç¨170 million. Nokia continued using the building as its head office, leasing it on a long-term basis. The building was transferred to Microsoft Mobile as part of the sale of Nokia's mobile phone business to Microsoft in April 2014, at which point the building was renamed Microsoft Talo (literally Microsoft House).

Biography Moschos was born in Agrinio in the Aitoloakarnania district. He was fifth of ten children. The family was originally from the village of Pentalofos near the town of Agrinio. In that village, his father owned a large amount of land which he later sold and moved the family to Agrinio where he opened two coffee houses where music was played. In one of those, musicians from Constantinople, Smyrna and Armenia appeared, while the other had a European orchestra. His father was a gifted clarino player who used it to play traditional Greek as well as other European music. His brother played the violin. The family's caf√©s were visited by some of the greatest musicians of that time, including Rita Abatzi, Marika Politissa, and Roza Eskenazi. Aristidis Moschos first heard the santouri played by in Romanian touring musical group and came to love the instrument. His first teacher was a member of that group, Nestoras Batsi. He quickly learned how to play and started appearing in his father's businesses. After the war, he left Agrinio and went to Athens where he attended the Greek Lyceum. With the Lyceum he did tours all over the world. He participated with many singers, musicians and actors. He made many radio and television broadcasts of modern and folk music. He released fifteen records, of which three became gold and two became platinum. He participated as a soloist in around 150 other records. In 1985, he ran the Traditional Music People's School which functioned as a nonprofit company, where he taught several musical instruments as well as Byzantine music. He was honoured by several municipalities and organizations as well as the Greek parliament. Moschos died on 8 November 2001.

The fairy godmother is a well-known form of this character. Many other supernatural patrons feature in fairy tales; these include various kinds of animals and the spirit of a dead mother.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures, \\"Fairy godmother\\", p147. In fairy tale and legend In his analysis of fairy tales, Vladimir Propp identified this role as the donor and listed it as one of the seven roles found in fairy tales. Before giving the hero magical support or advice, the donor may also test the hero, by questioning him, setting him tasks, or making requests of him. Then, the donor may directly give the hero a magical agent, advise him on how to find one, or offer to act on his behalf. If the character itself acts on behalf of the hero, it also takes on the role of helper in Propp's analysis. Because a donor is defined by acts, other characters may fill the role, even the villain; a boy escaping a witch may steal her magical handkerchief, making the witch an involuntary donor. Conversely, the donor of Rumpelstiltskin converts himself into the villain by demanding the heroine's baby as the price of his work. In Grimm's Fairy Tales, the hero often meets the vital helper in the woods, in liminal areas between other realms.Jack Zipes, The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World, p 115, When more than one character attempts the tasks, such as when the youngest son sets out last, all of them commonly met the donor. It is through failing in the test that the older sons are marked out as not being the hero; only the youngest son passes the test and receives the aid. There may be three donors, distinguished by the fact that the first two are unable to help and so send him on to the next. A common motif, as in Farmer Weathersky, is that one can consult all the beasts, the next all the fish, the third all the birds, and only the last can discover what the hero needs. In other cases, each of the three may give the hero or heroine something, but only the third has the information necessary to them. Types of donors Baba Yaga, though often the villain, acts as a donor in some fairy tales, as in The Death of Koschei the Deathless The characters of donors are numerous. Fairy godmothers were added to Sleeping Beauty by Perrault; no such figures appeared in his source, Sole, Luna, e Talia by Giambattista Basile.Jane Yolen, p 23, Touch Magic In the Grimm Brothers' variant of Cinderella, the protagonist is aided not by her fairy godmother but by her dead mother,Max L√ºthi, Once Upon A Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales, p 60, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., New York, 1970 as is the heroine of the Finnish variant, The Wonderful Birch. A great variety of other figures may also take this place. In Vasilissa the Beautiful, the heroine is aided by a wooden doll that her dying mother had given her; in Rushen Coatie, by a red calf sent to her by her dead mother, a calf that can continue to aid her after its death; in Katie Woodencloak by a mysterious dun bull; in Tattercoats, by a gooseherd who is her friend for a long time before his mysterious powers are revealed. In East of the Sun and West of the Moon, the heroine is given vital gifts by three old women she meets on the way. Heroes seldom have actual fairy godmothers, but similar figures are common.Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism, p 191, In The Golden Bird, the hero is aided by a fox whose advice he takes; in The Red Ettin, by a fairy not his godmother; in Puddocky, by an enchanted frog that takes pity on him; in Prince Ring, by an enchanted dog; in Fair Brow and The Bird 'Grip', by a dead man whom he had aided; in The Horse Gullfaxi and the Sword Gunnfoder, in an unusual reversal, by his stepmother. The hero may also meet up with several extraordinary men who will help him as in The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship, How the Hermit helped to win the King's Daughter, Long, Broad and Sharpsight, and The King Of Lochlin's Three Daughters. Each one has an ability, such as seeing things miles off, hearing things miles off, an extraordinary shot, ability to drink a river, or others that allow them to fulfill the hero's tasks. Talking animals are often the hero's helpers, perhaps more than any other type. The most common motivation of the animals is gratitude, after protection, receiving food, or (less commonly) settling a quarrel between several animals. In another variation, featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless, the hero's three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shape-shifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types. Because of its retelling by Perrault, Puss in Boots is among the best known animal helpers, although in other variants of the tale, the hero (or heroine) is helped sometimes by a fox and occasionally by other animals. Horses, as in The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa, FƒÉt-Frumos with the Golden Hair, The Magician's Horse, The Princess on the Glass Hill, and Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful, are popular in the oral tradition; several tale types normally feature a horse almost as important as the hero. This magical helper is often long faithful to the hero; the hero may fail many times after the initial test, often by not respecting the helper's advice. In The Golden Bird, the fox declares that the hero does not deserve his help after his disobedience, but still aids him.

As well as a race track proprietor, he was the preeminent owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses in the Southern United States during the first three decades of the 20th century. Testifying before a United States Senate committee in April 1934, Bradley identified himself as a \\"speculator, raiser of race horses and gambler.\\" He appeared on the cover of TIME magazine on May 7, 1934. In the year 2000, the Florida Department of State honored him as one of their Great Floridians.Time Magazine article titled \\"St. Edward of Lexington\\"accessdate=2008-08-14 Born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania of Irish descent. His ancestors were from Draperstown, County Londonderry, then in Ireland. At age fourteen, Edward Bradley was working as a roller in a steel mill before heading for Texas in 1874 to work on a ranch. During the Wild West era he worked as a cowboy, a scout for General Nelson A. Miles during the Indian War campaigns and was a friend of Wyatt Earp. Gaming businesses Whatever the myths may be, Bradley did in fact become successful as a gambler and eventually established a bookmaking partnership that served horse racing bettors at race tracks in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee and in St. Louis, Missouri where he married local woman, Agnes Cecilia Curry. He eventually moved to Chicago, Illinois where he would own a hotel, and probably a sports betting operation, and maintain business interests for the remainder of his life. By 1891, Bradley had accumulated considerable wealth. Bradley moved to St. Augustine in 1891 where he worked in real estate. In 1898, he moved him to build the Beach Club on Lake Worth Lagoon in Palm Beach. The exclusive restaurant and private gambling casino made him wealthy and he would expand operations to New Orleans, Louisiana with the opening of the Palmetto Club. Thoroughbred horse racing In 1898, Edward Bradley purchased his first racehorse which quickly led to the acquisition of others. In 1906, he bought Ash Grove Stock Farm, a property near Lexington, Kentucky which he renamed Idle Hour Stock Farm. This became the leading Thoroughbred breeding operation in the American South and added greatly to the rise of Kentucky as the most important horse breeding state in America and the Kentucky Derby as the country's premier race. At Idle Hour Stock farm, Bradley built first- class stables and breeding and training facilities. Bradley introduced the fibre skullcap worn by jockeys and as a racetrack owner made improvements to the starting gates. All of his horses were given a name that began with the Bradley \\"B\\". His stallion Black Toney, purchased from James R. Keene in 1912, became the farm's first important sire. In December 1930, Bradley purchased the French mare La Troienne, who had been consigned by owner Marcel Boussac to the Newmarket, England Sales. Over the years, Bradley's horses were conditioned for racing by several trainers such as Willie Knapp and Edward Haughton, but William A. \\"Bill\\" Hurley and future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Herbert J. Thompson met with the most success. Bill Hurley trained Kalitan, who won the 1917 Preakness Stakes, and Bagenbaggage, who won the 1926 Latonia and Louisiana Derbys and was second to Bradley's own Bubbling Over in the Kentucky Derby. Hurley won the 1935 Florida Derby, Coaching Club American Oaks and American Derby with the great filly and 1991 Racing Hall of Fame inductee Black Helen. Another of Bill Hurley's important Hall of Fame horses was Bimelech, who earned U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt and 3-Year-Old honors in 1939 and 1940 respectively, and just missed winning the U.S. Triple Crown when he finished second in the 1940 Kentucky Derby, then won both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. Herbert Thompson trained Bradley horses that won numerous important stakes race including four Kentucky Derbys, two of which were the first-ever back-to-back wins by a trainer or by an owner. Thompson won one of the Derbys with Burgoo King in 1932, who also won that year's Preakness Stakes. The most important horse Thompson trained for Edward Bradley was Blue Larkspur. The colt won the 1929 Belmont Stakes and was voted United States Horse of the Year honors and in 1930, U.S. Champion Older Male Horse. Edward Bradley's wins in the American Classic Races were as follows: ;Kentucky Derby *1921 - Behave Yourself *1926 - Bubbling Over *1932 - Burgoo King *1933 - Brokers Tip ;Preakness Stakes *1917 - Kalitan *1932 - Burgoo King *1940 - Bimelech ;Belmont Stakes *1929 - Blue Larkspur *1940 - Bimelech Edward Bradley raced horses at Arlington Park in Chicago as well as in New York, where Thoroughbred racing flourished at several race tracks near New York City and on Long Island. In addition to two wins in the prestigious Belmont Stakes, his horses won other important New York area races such as the: * Jerome Handicap (1920) * Withers Stakes (1929) * Matron Stakes (1930, 1932, 1935, 1944) * Alabama Stakes (1933) * Adirondack Stakes (1934, 1935, 1944) * Champagne Stakes (1934) * Saratoga Special Stakes (1934, 1939) * Test Stakes (1934) * Coaching Club American Oaks (1935) * Belmont Futurity (1939) * Saranac Handicap (1942) * Beldame Stakes (1946) * Frizette Stakes (1946) * Gazelle Handicap (1946) Bradley was given the honorific title of Kentucky Colonel by the Governor. Race track ownership Bradley was an owner of the Palmetto Club in New Orleans, Louisiana, which serviced a betting clientele for local horse races. In 1926, Edward Bradley purchased the Fair Grounds Race Course. In 1932, after making a substantial investment in Joseph E. Widener's new Hialeah Park Race Track near Miami, Florida, The \\"Colonel E.R. Bradley Handicap\\" is named in his memory and is raced annually in January at the Fair Grounds Race Course. In 1971, he was part of the inaugural class of inductees into the Fair Grounds Racing Hall of Fame. Philanthropy Edward Bradley and his wife Agnes had no children but donated money to orphanages. Annually in the fall, they held a racing day at Idle Hour Farm to raise money that was donated to various orphanages. They provided funding to various charitable causes such as the Good Samaritan Medical Center and St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach. His wife died in 1926 and Bradley bequeathed much of their Palm Beach property and personal residence to the city on the condition the land be used as a public park. Seven and 3/4 acres of lakefront property were bequeathed to St. Ann's parish along with the wish that it be used as a school for girls. The school that opened in 1926 was named St-Ann-on-the-Lake in honor of Bradley's wife, although later it changed its name to Rosarian Academy. Honored in 2000 as one of its \\"Great Floridians\\" by the Florida Department of State, his Great Floridian commemorative plaque is located at E.R. Bradley's Saloon at 104 Clematis Street in West Palm Beach. Edward R. Bradley died at Idle Hour Stock Farm on August 15, 1946 at age 86. He was buried next to his wife in Lexington's Calvary Cemetery. References * History of Fair Grounds Race Course * * Edward R.

The New England forces were contained to Annapolis Royal and wanted to secure the head of the Bay of Fundy. Led by Nicolas Antoine II Coulon de Villiers and Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne under orders from Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay, the French forces surprised and defeated a force of British troops, Massachusetts militia and rangers that were quartered in the village.  Background  Grand Pr√© had been the staging ground for the French and Mi'kmaq sieges of Annapolis Royal in 1744 and 1745. As a result, New England Ranger John Gorham demanded to take control of Grand Pr√© after the first siege in 1744 and again after the second. The French made another attempt at the capital in 1746 under the command of De Ramezay, who had to withdraw from the capital as a result of the failed Duc d'Anville Expedition. De Ramezay retired to Beaubassin. (During this time period, Ramezay sent troops to British-occupied Port-La-Joye on present-day Prince Edward Island. In a fierce battle, Ramezay's men killed 34 British troops and imprisoned the rest. In response to the assaults on Annapolis Royal that were being staged at Grand Pr√© (and Chignecto), Governor Shirley sent Colonel Arthur Noble and hundreds of New England soldiers to secure control over Grand Pr√©. In early December 1746 a force of one hundred men under the command of Captain Charles Morris was sent to Grand Pr√©. These troops were eventually joined by troops under the command of Captains Jedidiah Preble and Benjamin Goldthwait, and Colonel Gorham's Rangers. Colonel Noble arrived by sea with an additional one hundred men in early January 1747. In all there were approximately five hundred New England troops stationed at Grand Pr√©. Initially the troops were billeted at Grand Pr√© and several communities nearby. Upon Noble's arrival he ordered the troops brought into Grand Pr√© where they were billeted in twenty-four houses that extended across the village for nearly two and a half miles. At this early stage some of the Inhabitants at Grand Pr√© warned the New Englanders that \\"Messr. Ramezay had conceived some design\\" to attack them. The warning was ignored as the New Englanders felt it was \\"impracticable\\" to project such an attack that would mean a long march through deep snow and across \\"rivers being froze with ice floating up and down\\".  Gallery  File:Erasmus James Philipps, Old Burying Ground, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpgErasmus James Philipps, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) File:Battle of Grand Pre 1747, sign.pngBattle of Grand Pre 1747, sign  Trek from Beaubassin  After the rigors of the previous year's campaign in Nova Scotia the Canadian \\"detachment was extraordinarily weakened by maladies\\" including De Ramezay and it was for this reason he delegated command of the attack to Captain Coulon de Villiers., On January 21, 1747 the French then commenced a twenty-one day winter march to the Minas. The troops, on snowshoes and utilizing sleds, crossed to Bay Verte, followed the Northumberland shore to Tatamagouche, crossed the Cobequid Mountains to Cobequid Bay near present-day Truro, and by February 2 had reached the Shubenacadie River where they found the river blocked by ice and too dangerous for the main force to cross. De Villiers ordered Boish√©bert to cross the river with ten men and \\"to block the roads of the inhabitants in this district to make sure we are not discovered.\\". Throughout the trek the Canadian force was joined by both Acadian militia and Mi'kmaq warriors. Further assistance came when they were sheltered and fed by local Acadian families who also provided information on the New England positions. There were Acadians, however, that were not allies. At Cobequid (Truro), de Villiers took precaution \\"to block all the paths because the ill-intentioned inhabitants could undertake to pass and alert the English to our march.\\" With the lower Shubenacadie River blocked by ice, the main force travelled the eastern shore of the river until they passed the tidal reach and there crossed over to the western side. They quickly crossed overland to the Kennetcook River and then on to the Acadian village at Pisiguit where the villagers replenished their food supplies which had been running low for several days. By midday on February 10, despite a raging blizzard, the troops were on their final march, taking the old Acadian road over Horton Mountain to Melanson Village in the Gaspereau Valley, just a few miles from Grand Pr√©. At Melanson the troops were joined by Acadian guides who led them directly to the houses where the New English were billeted.  Battle  De Villiers' combined force of Canadians, Mi'kmaq and Acadians amounted to about five hundred men. A French account states de Villiers left the Beaubassin area with two hundred and fifty Canadians and fifty Mi'kmaq.De Saint Jean de Luz, le 25 May 1747. Vatican Secret Archives, Rome. (A report supplied by a French military officer to the Vatican). These troops, as previously mentioned, were further augmented by additional Mi'kmaq as well as Acadians. The French, on the night of February 10 in a blinding snowstorm and utilizing the element of surprise, attacked ten of the houses in which the New Englanders were billeted. Other than sentries, most of the New England personnel were asleep. The French were initially successful in the close-range fighting that followed. Col. Noble was killed along with four other British officers and the French took most of the houses killing over 60 British troops in fierce close-range fighting that also claimed the lives of many attackers. De Villiers' left arm was shattered almost immediately by a musket ball, a wound that would later lead to his death. He was replaced by his second-in- command, La Corne. The battle continued to rage across the village where the British managed to hold a few houses. The Canadians also attacked and captured the small fort at Hortonville and the two British supply sloops moored in the Basin. Eventually the British force rallied to concentrate their troops in a stronghold within a stone house in the center of the village which they held with 350 men and several small artillery pieces. The British made a sally from the stone house in the afternoon to try to recover their supply vessels but were unable to fight their way through deep snow drifts and were forced to retire to the stone house. The fighting continued until the next morning when a cease fire was arranged to end the stand-off as the French were unable to storm the stone house while the British were running out of ammunition and food. This truce stood throughout the day and the following morning the New Englanders agreed to capitulate under honourable terms. Captain Charles Morris reported sixty-seven New England troops killed, including their commander Col. Noble, along with upwards of forty taken prisoner, and forty more being wounded or sick. Morris estimated the French had lost 30 men but that the Acadians later \\"affirmed they saw buried by both parties one hundred and twenty men.\\" This would put the French losses at fifty-three.  Aftermath  After the cease-fire, both sides agreed to terms that allowed the British to return to Annapolis Royal. The 350 British in the stone house were allowed to keep their arms and march back to Annapolis Royal while the French retained the British troops captured in the fighting as well as the two supply sloops. The British marched away with full honours of war as article 3 of the capitulation stated: \\"That the troops of his most Christian Majesty shall be drawn up in two ranks with rested firelocks and that the troops of his Britannic Majesty should march thro them with all the military Honours of War with drums beating and colours flying.\\" The six-day march back through deep snow, unassisted by snowshoes, caused the New Englanders to suffer \\"extreme fatigues, excessive colds, and difficulties we laboured under through our men into violent fevers and fluxes at their return by which means we lost one hundred and fifty more.\\" The French later retired from Grand-Pr√©, initially to Noel, Nova Scotia (in the Cobequid region), taking with them prisoners of war as well as both French and New England wounded. The more severely wounded were left under the care of the Acadians at Grand Pr√©. Some of the prisoners would be released to the New Englanders in the spring, while the others were sent to Qu√©bec and then to Boston. The battle slowed the British advance to occupy the head of the Bay of Fundy. The New Englanders returned to Grand Pr√© shortly after, in March, 1747. They took possession of the stone house and required the Inhabitants to renew their \\"promise of a faithful obedience to the English Government.\\" They also sailed to Pisiguit where they burned, while under fire by Acadians, a vessel the Canadian troops had used when they withdrew from Minas. The area remained embroiled in conflict during Father Le Loutre's War (see Siege of Grand Pre). British forces did not advance farther into the Fundy basin until three years later when, in the aftermath of the Battle at Chignecto and the aftermath of the war in general, the British Army built Fort Lawrence. Both Nicolas Antoine II Coulon de Villiers and Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne were awarded the Order of Saint Louis from the King of France for their participation in the battle.  Commemorations  The location of the battle was designated by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada in 1924 and marked by a plaque in 1938. A number of authors have explored the battle in literature. The historian and poet Mary Jane Katzmann Lawson wrote the poem \\"The Battle of Grand Pre\\" about 1820 Merrill Denison who wrote a radio play \\"The Raid on Grand Pre\\" in 1931 and Archibald MacMechan wrote a book \\"Red Snow on Grand Pr√©\\" in the same year. One of the Acadians who accompanied the French on this expedition was Zedore Gould then aged 20, who afterwards escaping the Expulsion was a tenant to DesBarres on his Minudie estate. He lived to a great age and was fond of relating his experiences in this, the perhaps most famous exploit in Nova Scotian History.

Early life Shepherd was the son of George Robert Shepherd, a tailor of Spalding, Lincolnshire. Shepherd began working as an assistant to a cobbler in Bradford, joining a union and, in 1903, also joining the Independent Labour Party (ILP). From 1908, he spent a year working as the full-time ILP organiser for the Midlands, and was then appointed as an agent for the Labour Party in Dundee, where he was election agent for Alexander Wilkie. In 1913, he moved to Blackburn, to serve as agent for Philip Snowden.Labour Party, Annual Report of the Forty-Fifth Annual Conference of the Labour Party, p.22 He did not serve in the First World War, being a conscientious objector. Career In 1920, Shepherd became Labour Party District Organiser for the London and Southern area. He served as Assistant National Agent for from 1924 to 1929 and National Agent from 1929 to 1946. This meant he was in charge of the Labour Party agents nationwide at the landslide election victory which brought Clement Attlee to No. 10. The Member of parliament for Blackburn was the senior Labour Party politician Sir Stafford Cripps, a post war Chancellor of the Exchequer and this position must have been important to his career in The Labour Party. When Sir Winston Churchill requested that Clement Attlee and the Labour Party enter into a wartime coalition, he negotiated the terms of the coalition agreement with George Shepherd. House of Lords On 28 June 1946 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Shepherd, of Spalding in the County of Lincoln, becoming one of the few Labour peers in the House of Lords. Shepherd then served in the Labour administration of Clement Attlee as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip) from 1948 to 1949, as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) in 1949 and as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1949 to 1951. The latter year he was also sworn of the Privy Council. Personal life In 1915 he married Ada Newton. She was an active trade unionist and campaigner for women's rights who was supported by the Quaker families of Cadbury, Fry and Rowntree in fighting for a living wage for women. They had a son and a daughter, Margaret who died in 2015. Lord Shepherd died in December 1954, aged 73, and was succeeded in the barony by his only son Malcolm, who also became a prominent Labour politician and held many of the same offices as George Shepherd.

Where particular cities are concerned, the term is most often used for the capitals or depending centers of Denizli, Gaziantep, Kayseri, Bursa, Konya, Kocaeli, Kahramanmara≈ü. Within Turkey, the accent is laid on cities that have received little state investments or subsidies over the years. Ordu, √áorum, Denizli, Gaziantep and Kahramanmara≈ü, in particular, are cited among the cities who \\"made it themselves\\". In time order, while Denizli in Turkey's Aegean Region was the early hour precursor for rapid growth in an Anatolian Tiger pattern, Gaziantep, Malatya, Konya and Kayseri are the most recently cited prominent Tigers on the basis of the number of companies they have among Turkey's 500 biggest. These largest are the forerunners of further large companies and a multitude of smaller ones. Aside from their production units, the definition generally excludes companies who have their headquarters in the largest cities of Turkey; namely ƒ∞stanbul, Ankara, ƒ∞zmir, Bursa and Adana, as well as companies constituted with public capital. The term is also echoed, in the form \\"Anatolian Lions\\" (Turkish: Anadolu Aslanlarƒ±), by the name of the private sector association Askon that brings together businessmen from a number of other cities who have found common grounds between each other. This association has branches in Ankara, Burdur, Bursa, Gebze, ƒ∞zmit, Konya, Malatya and Trabzon. These lions are less often cited among the tigers for several reasons. Other variations of the term, such \\"Turkey's Tigers\\" or \\"Turkish Tigers\\", as used by the PBS without excluding the most commonly used form of \\"Anatolian Tigers\\" have also been pronounced. { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" !City !!Nr. of companies } Beyond their shared characteristics in an economical perspective, references have also been made, especially in international media, to different political connotations within the term, including by associating this capital with Islamic values or extending its whole under such definitions as \\"Islamic capital\\" or \\"green capital\\". The political choices and the voting trends of the cities and of particulars in question may differ widely between each other. A 2005 study by the European Stability Initiative that was focused on Kayseri uses the term \\"Islamic Calvinists\\" to define the entrepreneurs and their values. Several business awards or conferences in Turkey draw reference from the term \\"Anatolian Tigers\\" or its variants. The term was copied after the Asian Tigers. Geographical distribution According to the 2005 Istanbul Chamber of Industry's annual ranking of Turkey's top 1000 industrial enterprises,Istanbul Chamber of Industry the adjacent table contains cities which best fit the definition of Anatolian Tigers.Istanbul Chamber of Industry: Turkey's Top 1000 Industrial Enterprises . The table excludes the Thrace-ƒ∞stanbul-Bursa-Eski≈üehir-Ankara axis, the highly integrated ƒ∞zmir- Manisa-Aydƒ±n and √áukurova regions, as well as the Turkish coastline until the coal basin in the western Black Sea Region. Southeastern Anatolia Project region, included in the count, currently displays only the first signs of its potential industrial might. Likewise, the recent opening of continuous highway along the Black Sea coast is expected to deeply influence the fortunes of the region along the shoreline.

St. Francis Xavier came to Manapad in 1542, when he began missionary activity on the Fishery coast. He lived in a grotto cavern on the seaward face of a cliff and held mass at a chapel of the Captain's Cross, built from a ship's mast after a storm in 1540. Holy Cross Church, built close to the sea in 1581, has a relic fragment believed to be from the True Cross of Jerusalem. From 1 to 14 September, every year, the cross is publicly displayed for thousands who attend the festival season. History right right Traditional stories say that in 1540, a Portuguese trading vessel, while sailing around the Cape of Good Hope on its way to the East, encountered a violent storm splitting its sails and snapping the hind mast, leaving it at risk of foundering. The captain, who was devoted to the veneration of the Holy Cross, implored and entrusted the safety of the vessel and that of the crew to the crucified Christ. He also made a vow that he would construct a cross from a portion of the splintered mast and have it planted on the shore where they alighted in safety. By chance, the vessel, after having drifted for several days, sought haven in the then well known port of Kulasekharapatnam. Valliamman cave is located nearby.  Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross  The festival of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is celebrated annually by the Catholic Church on 14 September. It is the tradition of Portuguese to lay the cross in the places where they live.

The attack was made on the ch√¢teau at La Caine, about to the south-west of the city of Caen, north of Thury-Harcourt. The ch√¢teau had recently been occupied by , the command organisation for the German Panzer divisions in France and Belgium. Eighteen staff officers were killed in the attack and the commander, Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg was wounded. A counter-offensive being prepared against the Allied beachhead by the was postponed and then cancelled; command was transferred to the headquarters of the . was withdrawn to Paris and remained out of action until 28 June. Background= (Field Marshal) Gerd von Rundstedt, ( the commander of German forces in western Europe) established , ( Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg from 19 November 1943 to 4 July 1944) as a headquarters for the administration and training of the seven Panzer divisions based in northern France and Belgium. The organisation was also to command the Panzer divisions as a strategic reserve during the anticipated Allied invasion from Britain. On 9 June 1944, three days after the beginning of Operation Overlord, the invasion of France by the Western Allies, Erwin Rommel, the commander of (Army Group B) with responsibility for the defence of northern France drove to the HQ of and gave orders for a counter-offensive against the Allied landings in Normandy. Government Code and Cypher School The Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) code-breaking organisation at Bletchley Park read German radio signals encrypted by the Enigma cypher machine and was part of an elaborate system of wireless listening posts, traffic analysis and direction finding used against Germany during the war. Ultra decrypts on 11 and 18 March 1944 established the existence of and that its headquarters was in Paris. A big increase in wireless traffic from was detected by the British Monitoring Section on 8 June 1944, when the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division came under the command of the . The site of the source was identified by High-frequency direction finding (\\"huff-duff\\") at the ch√¢teau in the commune of La Caine, about to the south-west of the city of Caen. The information was forwarded to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and other headquarters in Normandy in signals and . had taken up residence at the ch√¢teau and left its vehicles in the orchard with no other camouflage. Prelude=2nd TAF Early on 10 June, the Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF) of the Royal Air Force (RAF) was ordered immediately to attack the ch√¢teau with every available aircraft. At RAF Hurn in Dorset, 124 Wing, comprising 181 Squadron, 182 Squadron and 247 Squadron equipped with Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers and at RAF Holmsley South, 245 Squadron of 121 Wing were ordered to readiness. At RAF Dunsfold, 139 Wing, comprising 98 Squadron, 180 Squadron and 320 (Netherlands) Squadron plus 226 Squadron of 137 Wing at RAF Hartford Bridge flying North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers were alerted. A maximum effort consisted of ten Typhoons per squadron and eighteen Mitchells from each of the medium bomber squadrons. The Typhoons were loaded with eight 60-pound RP-3 rockets each and the Mitchells were to carry their maximum bomb loads of eight bombs; four squadrons of Spitfires were to escort the bombers. The plan was to attack with the rocket-firing Typhoons at low altitude, combined with bombing by the Mitchells from medium altitude. Preparations The morning of 10 June was overcast and cloudy and the briefing was postponed until the cloud cover diminished (times given are British Double Summer Time (1941‚Äì1945) two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time). Wing Commander Lynn the Wing Commander (Flying) was to lead the Mitchells with 180 Squadron flying at the head of the formation. With the weather still not ideal, the first Mitchell of each bomber squadron was to be led by an aircraft carrying G-H navigation equipment as a precaution against cloud over the target. While waiting on the weather, the Typhoons of 124 Wing flew two raids on gun emplacements near Caen. Eighteen Mitchells took off in three flights of six at followed by seventeen Mitchells of 320 (Netherlands) Squadron (Commander Burgerhout). At sixteen more bombers from 98 Squadron (Squadron Leader Eager) took off; the three squadrons circling while gaining height and getting into formation, then setting course for France at Over Selsey Bill eighteen more Mitchells of 226 Squadron (Wing Commander Mitchell) joined the formation. The 33 Spitfire Mk Vs of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB the defensive part of Fighter Command since 17 November 1943) for close escort and the high and low cover of three Spitfire Mk IX squadrons from 84 Group 2nd TAF (the offensive part of Fighter Command since the split with ADGB) arrived soon after. A Mitchell from 226 Squadron turned back with mechanical failure and two from 180 Squadron returned before the bomb run over La Caine, one with a loss of oil pressure and one with an instrument fault. The spare aircraft from two of the four Typhoon squadrons joined in, making 42 Typhoons, eight of which flew as fighters, without rocket armament. The Typhoons were to attack in two waves, thirty minutes apart, the first wave to attack the motor transport around the ch√¢teau synchronised with the bombing by the Mitchells and the second wave to attack anything left. Attack In the evening of 10 June, General Sigismund-Helmut von Dawans, chief of staff of and 18 staff officers were at dinner in Ch√¢teau La Caine when air raid sirens went off. The officers hurried outside to see and watched the Typhoons through binoculars, not aware that they were the target until the last minute; Schweppenburg arrived by car just before the attack. The 17 Typhoons of 181 and 247 squadrons fired 136 rockets from . At the Mitchells of 139 Wing moved into Vic formation with 226 Squadron at the base of the V, the squadrons remaining in flights of six; at the bombers released five-hundred pound bombs, except for one Mitchell, whose eight bombs hung up. The bombs landed with great accuracy on the ch√¢teau and the grounds, killing Dawans and 17 of the 18 staff officers, Schweppenburg and another officer being wounded. Four of the Typhoons not carrying rockets strafed the village of Montigny nearby and the Mitchells turned north-west, receiving some from the vicinity of Caen. The second wave of rocket-armed Typhoons arrived to find the ch√¢teau and the vehicles destroyed and fired their rockets at anything still standing. The Mitchells landed by and preparations began for a night operation. Aftermath=Analysis As the Allied crews were debriefed, they claimed a big success; most bomber crews reporting that they had hit the target; anti- aircraft fire had been sparse and no German fighters had intervened, the Germans appeared to have been surprised. The attack destroyed the only German army organisation in the western theatre capable of handling a large number of mobile divisions; the survivors of were withdrawn to Paris and were not ready to resume operations until 28 June. German command of the sector was temporarily given to Sepp Dietrich and the . In the 2009 edition of a history of the use of Ultra information, Ralph Bennett wrote that an armoured counter- attack against the Allied beachhead planned for 10 June, was postponed for 24 hours and then cancelled. Bletchley Park decrypted German signals that had been destroyed and would have to be withdrawn to Paris to be reconstituted. The appointment of new staff under General Heinrich Eberbach, delayed the plans for the German armoured counter-offensive by three weeks but it was overtaken by events. The destruction the HQ contributed to the loss of the initiative by the Germans. No German suspicions were aroused about Allied code breaking, because a reconnaissance aircraft had been seen before the raid. The decrypts revealing the whereabouts of were the first of a series which revealed the positions of tactically valuable targets, including the positions of fuel and ammunition dumps, which were attacked to exacerbate German shortages, also being revealed by Ultra decrypts. Casualties Eighteen staff officers of were known to have been killed in the raid, including the chief of staff, Dawans, interred in La Cambe German war cemetery and Schweppenburg was wounded. The ch√¢teau was not badly damaged but the nearby orchard, in which the HQ vehicles were parked, was thoroughly bombed and communications equipment was destroyed.

Environment Fifty-eight hectares of heathland and lowland valley bogs with secondary woodland around the perimeter, Hothfield contains Kent's last four valley bogs and one of its few remaining fragments of open heath with patches of acid grassland. Until the early 20th century, livestock grazing maintained the open character of Hothfield Common. Once this ceased, bracken and birch began to overrun the reserve, leading to the loss of the heathland and bog habitat, and resulting in the loss of many rare and highly specialised plants and animals. Habitat management work initiated by Kent Wildlife Trust with the support of Ashford Borough Council, Hothfield Parish Council and Natural England is now helping to restore and maintain a mosaic of open heath, grassland and bog. Once the initial invading scrub has been cut back, grazing with livestock is the key to maintaining suitable habitat. Grazing may occur at any time of the year so dogs should be kept under close control. Many plants such as heather, cross- leaved heath, dwarf and common gorse, heath spotted-orchid, bog asphodel, and round-leaved sundew are now thriving, along with keeled skimmer dragonfly and tree pipit as a result of heath and bog habitat restoration.

He played his club football for Naomh Adhamhn√°in and also represented the Donegal county team and won the 1998 and 2001 International Rules Series with Ireland. Of a temperament, Devenney often wandered away from the sport to play association football instead. Described by RT√â as \\"one of the greatest players to have worn the Donegal jersey\\", Devenney was his county's \\"main marksman in the pre-McGuinness era\\". In retirement, Devenney remains involved with his local club (having co-managed them to a Donegal Senior Football Championship in 2012), appears on media platforms such as Highland Radio and files a column for the Letterkenny Leader. He is also having to come to terms with Michael Murphy naming him on national television as his childhood hero. A shocked Devenney opened up on this revelation years later: \\"And that was back when Michael was already the fuckin' man! The fact that he has called me his hero is, probably, the most humbling thing that anyone has ever said to me\\". Devenney later said: \\"Has anyone's hero turned around and then been their hero? Because Michael would be mine. So it's come full circle\\". Playing career Devenney played for his school team, St Eunan's College. Club In the final of the 1999 Donegal Senior Football Championship, Devenney broke Martin McHugh's record by scoring 0‚Äì14 of his team's 1‚Äì19 to their opponents Aodh Ruadh's 1‚Äì11. Devenney punctured a lung while playing for his club against Clonoe of Tyrone in the Ulster Club SFC in 2008. He ignored his injury, sustained in the first half, and carried on until the end of the game‚Äîscoring four points and contributing to the decisive goal which won the game for his team‚Äîafter which he was hospitalised. He also captained his club. He also played for Donegal New York. County Devenney played senior football for Donegal despite not having played underage. His debut against Cork in the National Football League quarter-final at Croke Park in March 1998 was nothing short of sensational: he scored 2‚Äì2. Declan Bonner gave Devenney his championship debut in 1998. He played in his first Ulster Senior Football Championship final later that year, and though he lost, he received the man of the match award. He often partnered Adrian Sweeney in Donegal's forward line. Devenney had a decent game against Armagh in the 2004 Ulster final at Croke Park. He played championship football until 2005. He came back in 2007. That year, Devenney contributed to the county winning its first National Football League title in 2007, passing a late fitness test to play in the final against Mayo. However, he went off injured during the game, which Donegal won, and Kevin McMenamin replaced him. He made a substitute appearance against Armagh in the 2007 Ulster SFC quarter-final at MacCumhaill Park on 27 May that year and scored the last-minute goal which defeated the Orchard County by a single point on a scoreline of 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8. However, he was excluded from the squad in 2008. He confirmed his retirement from football's top level on 29 December 2009. Devenney never won the Ulster Senior Football Championship during his career. Shortly after his departure Donegal won an All-Ireland Senior Football title in 2012. Devenney said, He spoke again in 2020 of the \\"dread\\" he experienced ahead of playing for Donegal against other Ulster teams. National team Devenney represented Ireland in the 1998 International Rules Series. He scored one over (worth three points) in the second test, which was held at Croke Park on 18 October, as Ireland won the series by an aggregate score of 128‚Äì118. He was his country's leading scorer against Australia in the 2001 International Rules Series, as Ireland romped to victory in Australia. He scored four overs in the first test, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 12 October, as Ireland won 59‚Äì53. He scored two overs in the second test, held at Football Park in Adelaide on 19 October. Association football While playing for Donegal, Devenney would often pass the time during the 2000s by playing association football matches for League of Ireland club Finn Harps. He was involved in the 2001‚Äì02 League of Ireland Premier Division relegation playoff penalty shoot-out loss to Longford Town after Finn Harps qualified via the 2001‚Äì02 League of Ireland First Division. In 2006, he became disillusioned and began playing association football in the north with Portadown. There was also Limavady United somewhere. Devenney, however, was not sufficiently interested in the sport to take up an offer of a two-year contract with Finn Harps in 2007, preferring to play football for Donegal. Devenney currently plays the sport for Gweedore United in the Donegal Junior Football League, an association football competition. Post-playing career Devenney coaches his local club and does radio commentary for the BBC. He has been critical of the qualifiers the GAA have brought into the All- Ireland Senior Football Championship, saying they have \\"diluted the Championship season a bit.\\" He has also been involved in a national radio debate hosted by Marian Finucane on the topic of money. He predicted Derry would beat Donegal in the 2014 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter- final. DL Debate On 10 February 2020, a weekly programme called DL Debate began airing on Highland Radio. It originated in discussion between Devenney and Ois√≠n Kelly between games on a Sunday, with Devenney concluding that a Monday evening programme to discuss the weekend's fixtures was necessary. Devenney's guests on the first episode included John Haran, Colm Parkinson (Laois) and Ciar√°n Whelan (Dublin). Others in later episodes included Neil Gallagher, John Gildea, Enda McGinley (Tyrone), Rory Kavanagh, Donal Reid, Bernard Flynn (Meath), P. J. McGowan and David Brady (Mayo).All Highland Radio:    * * Honours ;Club * Donegal Senior Football Championship: 1999, 2001, 2007, 2008, 2009 ;County * National Football League: 2007 ;Country * International Rules Series: 1998, 2001 ;Individual * Ulster Senior Football Championship final man of the match: 1998 * All Star nomination: 2001 ReferencesExternal links * * Brendan Devenney at gaainfo.com * Charlie Collins is TALKING SPORT with ‚Ä¶Brendan Devenney Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:BBC sports presenters and reporters Category:Donegal inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code Category:Gaelic football forwards Category:Gaelic games commentators Category:Gaelic games writers and broadcasters Category:Irish international rules football players Category:People educated at St Eunan's College Category:People from Letterkenny Category:St Eunan's Gaelic footballers Category:Ulster inter- provincial Gaelic footballers Category:Finn Harps F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Limavady United F.C. players Category:Portadown F.C. players Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers ","title":"Brendan Devenney"},{"id":"10837310","text":"Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard visual symbols for use with BioBricks Standard BioBrick parts are DNA sequences which conform to a restriction-enzyme assembly standard. These building blocks are used to design and assemble larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts and combinations of parts with defined functions, which would then be incorporated into living cells such as Escherichia coli cells to construct new biological systems. Examples of BioBrick parts include promoters, ribosomal binding sites (RBS), coding sequences and terminators. Overview Abstraction hierarchy allows the breakdown of complexity. The BioBrick parts are used by applying engineering principles of abstraction and modularization. BioBrick parts form the base of the hierarchical system on which synthetic biology is based. There are three levels to the hierarchy: # Parts: Pieces of DNA that form a functional unit (for example promoter, RBS, etc.) # Device: Collection set of parts with defined function. In simple terms, a set of complementary BioBrick parts put together forms a device. # System: Combination of a set of devices that performs high-level tasks. The development of standardized biological parts allows for the rapid assembly of sequences. The ability to test individual parts and devices to be independently tested and characterized also improves the reliability of higher-order systems. History The first attempt to create a list of standard biological parts was in 1996, by Rebatchouk et al. This team introduced a cloning strategy for the assembly of short DNA fragments. However, this early attempt was not widely recognised by the scientific research community at the time. In 1999, Arkin and Endy realized that the heterogeneous elements that made up a genetic circuit were lacking standards, so they proposed a list of standard biological parts. BioBricks were described and introduced by Tom Knight at MIT in 2003. Since then, various research groups have utilized the BioBrick standard parts to engineer novel biological devices and systems.  BioBricks Foundation  The BioBricks Foundation was formed in 2006 by engineers and scientists alike as a not-for-profit organization to standardize biological parts across the field. The Foundation focuses on improving in areas of Technology, Law, Education and the Global Community as they apply to synthetic biology. BioBricks Foundation's activities include hosting SBx.0 Conferences, technical and educational programs. The SBx.0 conferences are international conferences on synthetic biology hosted across the world. Technical programs are aimed at the production of a series of standard biological parts, and their education expansion is creating acts which help create open, standardized sources of biological parts.  BioBricks Public Agreement  As an alternative to traditional biotechnology patent systems and in an effort to allow BioBricks to be utilized as an open-source community standard, the BioBricks Foundation created the BioBricks Public Agreement (BPA). The BPA allows users to establish invention of uses of parts, to disclose patents on parts combinations, and to freely build on the contributions of other users. BioBrick Assembly standard The BioBrick assembly standard was introduced to overcome the lack of standardization posed by traditional molecular cloning methods. The BioBrick assembly standard is a more reliable approach for combining parts to form larger composites. The assembly standard enables two groups of synthetic biologists in different parts of the world to re-use a BioBrick part without going through the whole cycle of design and manipulation. This means the newly designed part can be used by other teams of researchers more easily. Besides that, when compared to the old-fashioned ad hoc cloning method, the assembly standard process is faster and promotes automation. The BioBrick assembly standard 10 was the first assembly standard to be introduced. Over the years, several other assembly standards, such as the Biofusion standard and Freiburg standard have been developed. BioBrick assembly standard 10 Standard assembly of two BioBrick parts (promoter and coding sequence) by digestion and ligation which forms a 'scar' site(M). Assembly standard 10 was developed by Tom Knight, and is the most widely used assembly standard. It involves the use of restriction enzymes. Every BioBrick part is a DNA sequence which is carried by a circular plasmid, which acts as a vector. The vector acts as a transport system to carry the BioBrick parts. The first approach towards a BioBrick standard was the introduction of standard sequences, the prefix and suffix sequences, which flank the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the DNA part respectively. These standard sequences encode specific restriction enzyme sites. The prefix sequence encodes EcoRI (E) and Xbal (X) sites, while the suffix sequence encodes SpeI (S) and PstI (P) sites. The prefix and the suffix are not considered part of the BioBrick part. To facilitate the assembly process, the BioBrick part itself must not contain any of these restriction sites. During the assembly of two different parts, one of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI. The plasmid carrying the other BioBrick part is digested with EcoRI and Xbal. This leaves both plasmids with 4 base pair (bp) overhangs at the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends. The EcoRI sites will ligate since they are complementary to each other. The Xbal and SpeI sites will also ligate as the digestion produces compatible ends. Now, both the DNA parts are in one plasmid. The ligation produces an 8 base pair ‚Äòscar‚Äô site between the two BioBrick parts. Since the scar site is a hybrid of the Xbal and SpeI sites, it is not recognized by either restriction enzyme. The prefix and suffix sequences remain unchanged by this digestion and ligation process, which allows for subsequent assembly steps with more BioBrick parts. This assembly is an idempotent process: multiple applications do not change the end product, and maintain the prefix and suffix. Although the BioBrick standard assembly allows for the formation of functional modules, there is a limitation to this standard 10 approach. The 8 bp scar site does not allow the creation of a fusion protein. The scar site causes a frame shift which prevents the continuous reading of codons, which is required for the formation of fusion protein. Tom Knight later developed the BB-2 assembly standard in 2008 to address problems with joining the scars of protein domains and that the scars consist of eight bases, which will yield an altered reading frame when joining protein domains. The enzymes used for digestion of the initial parts are almost the same, but with modified prefixes and suffixes.  BglBricks assembly standard  The BglBrick assembly standard was proposed by J. Christopher Anderson, John E. Dueber, Mariana Leguia, Gabriel C. Wu, Jonathan C. Goler, Adam P. Arkin, and Jay D. Keasling in September 2009 as a standard very similar in concept to BioBrick, but enabling the generation of fusion proteins without altering the reading frame or introducing stop codons and while creating a relatively neutral amino acid linker scar (GlySer). A BglBrick part is as a DNA sequence flanked by 5‚Ä≤ EcoRI and BglII sites (GAATTCaaaA _GATCT_ ) and 3‚Ä≤ BamHI and XhoI sites ( _G_ GATCCaaaCTCGAG), and lacking in these same restriction sites internally. The upstream part in the pairwise assembly is purified from an EcoRI/BamHI digest, and the downstream part+vector is purified from an EcoRI/BglII digest. Ligation of these two fragments creates a composite part reforming the original flanking sites required in the part definition and leaving a _GGATCT_ scar sequence at the junction of the parts, a scar that encodes the amino acids glycine and serine when fusing CDS parts together in-frame, convenient due to the GlySer dipeptide being a popular linker of protein domains. Silver (Biofusion) standard Biofusion assembly of two BioBrick parts.The schematic diagram shows the 6 base pair scar site made due to the deletion and insertion of nucleotide in the XbaI and SpeI sites. Pam Silver's lab created the Silver assembly standard to overcome the issue surrounding the formation of fusion protein. This assembly standard is also known as Biofusion standard, and is an improvement of the BioBrick assembly standard 10. Silver's standard involves deletion of one nucleotide from the Xbal and SpeI site, which shortens the scar site by 2 nucleotides, which now forms a 6 bp scar sequence. The 6 bp sequence allows the reading frame to be maintained. The scar sequence codes for the amino acid threonine (ACT) and arginine (AGA). This minor improvement allows for the formation of in-frame fusion protein. However, arginine's being a large, charged amino acid is a disadvantage to the Biofusion assembly technique: these properties of arginine result in the destabilisation of the protein by the N-end rule. Freiburg standard The 2007 Freiburg iGEM team introduced a new assembly standard to overcome the disadvantages of the existing Biofusion standard technique. The Freiburg team created a new set of prefix and suffix sequences by introducing additional restriction enzyme sites, AgeI and NgoMIV to the existing prefix and suffix respectively. These newly introduced restriction enzyme sites are BioBrick standard compatible. The Freiburg standard still forms a 6 bp scar site, but the scar sequence (ACCGGC) now codes for threonine and glycine respectively. This scar sequence results in a much more stable protein as the glycine forms a stable N-terminal, unlike the arginine, which signals for N-terminal degradation. The assembly technique proposed by the Freiburg team diminishes the limitations of the Biofusion standard. Assembly method Different methods are used when it comes to assembling BioBricks. This is because some standards require different materials and methods (use of different restriction enzymes), while others are due to preferences in protocol because some methods of assembly have higher efficiency and is user-friendly. 3 Antibiotic (3A) Assembly The 3A assembly method is the most commonly used, as its compatible with assembly Standard 10, Silver standard as well as the Freiburg standard. This assembly method involves two BioBrick parts and a destination plasmid. The destination plasmid contains the toxic (lethal) gene, to ease the selection of correctly assembled plasmid. The destination plasmids also have different antibiotic resistance genes than the plasmids carrying the BioBrick parts. All three plasmids are digested with appropriate restriction enzyme and then allowed to ligate. Only the correctly assembled part will produce a viable composite part contained in the destination plasmid. This allows a good selection as only the correctly assembled BioBrick parts survives.  Amplified Insert Assembly  The amplified insert assembly method does not depend on prefix and suffix sequences, allowing to be used in combination with a majority of assembly standards. It also has a higher transformation rate than 3A assembly, and it does not require the involved plasmids to have different antibiotic resistance genes. This method reduces noise from uncut plasmids by amplifying a desired insert using PCR prior to digestion and treating the mixture with the restriction enzyme DpnI, which digests methylated DNA like plasmids. Eliminating the template plasmids with DpnI leaves only the insert to be amplified by PCR. To decrease the possibility of creating plasmids with unwanted combinations of insert and backbone, the backbone can be treated with phosphatase to prevent its religation.  Gibson Scarless Assembly  The Gibson scarless assembly method allows the joining of multiple BioBricks simultaneously. This method requires the desired sequences to have an overlap of 20 to 150 bps. Because BioBricks do not have this overlap, this method requires PCR primers to create overhangs between adjacent BioBricks. T5 exonuclease attacks the 5' ends of sequences, creating single-stranded DNA in the ends of all sequences where the different components are designed to anneal. DNA polymerase then adds DNA parts to gaps in the anneal components, and a Taq ligase can seal the final strands.  Methylase-assisted (4R/2M) Assembly  The 4R/2M assembly method was designed to combine parts (BioBrick Assembly Standard 10 or Silver Standard) within existing plasmids (i.e. without PCR or subcloning). The plasmids are reacted in vivo with sequence-specific DNA methyltransferases, so that each is modified and protected from one of two restriction endonucleases that are later used to linearize undesired circular ligation products.

PeerJ 8:e9841 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9841 Parts Registry The MIT group led by Tom Knight that developed BioBricks and International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition are also the pioneers of The Registry of Standard Biological Parts (Registry). Registry being one of the foundations of synthetic biology, provides web-based information and data on over 20,000 BioBrick parts. The Registry contains: *Information and characterisation data for all parts, device and system *Includes a catalogue which describes the function, performance and design of each part Every BioBrick part has its unique identification code which makes the search for the desired BioBrick part easier (for example, BBa_J23100, a constitutive promoter). The registry is open access, whereby anyone can submit a BioBrick part. Most of the BioBrick submission is from students participating in the annual iGEM competition hosted every summer. The Registry allows exchange of data and materials online which allows rapid re-use and modifications of parts by the participating community. Professional parts registries have also been developed. Since most of the BioBrick parts are submitted by undergraduates as part of the iGEM competition, the parts may lack important characterisation data and metadata which would be essential when it comes to designing and modelling the functional components. One example of a professional parts registry is the USA-based publicly funded facility, The International Open Facility Advancing Biotechnology (BIOFAB), which contains detailed descriptions of each biological part. It is also an open-source registry, and is available commercially. BIOFAB aims to catalogue high-quality BioBrick parts to accommodate the needs of professional synthetic biology community. The BioBrick Foundation (BBF) is a public-benefit organization established to promote the use of standardized BioBrick parts on a scale beyond the iGEM competition. The BBF is currently working on the derivation of standard framework to promote the production high quality BioBrick parts which would be freely available to everyone.

Because there were notorious pirate strongholds in Cilicia, on the southern coast of Asia Minor, the term \\"Cilician\\" was long used to generically refer to any pirates in the Mediterranean. Rise of piracy With the destruction of Carthage, the demise of the Seleucid Empire, and Ptolemaic Egypt on the wane, there was no strong naval power left in the Mediterranean. Rome was the only major Mediterranean power left, but being land based had a reduced navy at that time and relied on hiring ships as necessity required. Rome protected the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas, on account of their proximity, with expeditions sent against the pirate bases on the Ligurian and Illyrian coast. As a result, the pirates became consolidated and organized. The smaller communities of the Greek and African waters were left to make their own arrangements. Communities unable to fend off the pirate incursions were forced to come to an understanding with the pirates, and thus became havens. Crete was still independent. Civil wars had devastated the land, and much of the population turned to piracy. Crete became a major haven for pirates, with its strategic position in the midst of the Mediterranean and because it did not fall under the control of any of the Mediterranean empires. Cilicia was the other major pirate refuge. Like Crete, Cilicia enjoyed excellent natural harbours which geography rendered easily defensible. The Seleucids, who ruled over most of Cilicia, were too weak to suppress them, and Diodotus Tryphon, king of the Seleucid Empire from 142-138 BC, actually supported them, in order to strengthen his position. Around 140 BC, Rome sent Scipio Aemilianus to assess the situation. He reported that the governments of the region were too weak or unwilling to settle the issue. Rome at this time was unwilling to spend the effort needed to reduce the Cilician pirates, perhaps because of the benefits piracy afforded the Romans (the pirates supplied the Romans with cheap slaves - captured during their raids). Consequently, the pirates remained the only considerable naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean. They eventually had bases all throughout the Mediterranean. The Piracy Problem in the Mediterranean increased over the decades. A large network of pirates coordinated operations over wide areas with large fleets. According to Cassius Dio, many years of war contributed to this. Many war fugitives joined them. Pirates were more difficult to catch or break up than bandits. The pirates pillaged coastal fields and towns. Rome was affected through shortages of imports and the supply of grains, but the Romans did not pay proper attention to the problem. They sent out fleets when ‚Äòthey were stirred by individual reports‚Äô and these did not achieve anything. Cassius Dio wrote that these operations caused greater distress for Rome's allies. It was thought that a war against the pirates would be big and expensive and that it was impossible to attack all the pirates at once or to drive them back everywhere. As not much was done against them, some towns were turned into pirate winter quarters and raids further inland were carried out. Many pirates settled on land in various places and relied on an informal network of mutual assistance. Towns in Italy were also attacked, including Ostia, the port of Rome: ships were burnt and there was pillaging. The pirates seized important Romans and demanded large ransoms.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 36.20-23.1-4. Plutarch also linked the worsening of the piracy problem to war and did so in more specific terms. The Third Mithridatic War (73‚Äì63 BC) against king Mithridates VI of Pontus (in modern northern Turkey) played a part in giving the pirates boldness because piracy lent itself to Mithridates‚Äô service. This suggested that Mithridates fostered piracy as a means to weaken the Romans. Plutarch also thought that with the civil wars in Rome the Romans left the sea unguarded, which gave the pirates the confidence to lay waste islands and coastal cities in addition to attacking ships at sea. Piracy spread from its original base in Cilicia (on the southern coast of modern Turkey). The pirates also seized and ransomed some towns. Men of distinction also got involved in piracy. Plutarch claimed that pirates had more than 1,000 ships, that they captured 400 towns and plundered temples in Greece and sacred and inviolable sanctuaries, listing fourteen of them. He cited the praetors Sextilius and Bellinus and the daughter of Antonius among the important Romans who were seized for a ransom. The pirates also mocked their captives if they were Romans. Piracy spread over the whole of the Mediterranean, making it unnavigable and closed to trade. This caused scarcity of provisions.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Life of Pompey, 24‚Äì25.1. Appian attributed the escalation of piracy to Mithridates plundering the Roman province of Asia extensively in 88 BC and the rest of the First Mithridatic War (89‚Äì85 BC). The destitute people who lost their livelihood became pirates. At first, they scoured the sea with a few small boats. As the war dragged on they became more numerous and used larger ships. When the war ended piracy continued. They sailed in squadrons. They besieged towns or took them by storm and plundered them. They kidnapped rich people for a ransom. The ragged part of the Cilician coast became their main area for anchorage and encampment and the Crags of Cilicia (the promontory of Coracesium) became their main base. It also attracted men from Pamphylia, Pontus, Cyprus, Syria and elsewhere in the east. There were quickly tens of thousands of pirates and they dominated the whole Mediterranean. They defeated some Roman naval commanders, even off the coast of Sicily. The sea became unsafe. This disrupted trade and some lands remained untilled, leading to food shortages and hunger in Rome. Eliminating such a scattered and large force from no particular country and of an intangible and lawless nature seemed a difficult task. In Appian's opinion Lucius Licinius Murena and his successor Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (78‚Äì74 BC) did not accomplish anything against them.Appian, The Mithridatic War, 91‚Äì93. Cilicia had been a haven for pirates for a long time. It was divided into two parts, Cilicia Trachaea (Rugged Cilicia), a mountainous area in the west, and Cilicia Pedias (flat Cilicia) in the east by the Limonlu River. The first Roman campaign against the pirates was led by Marcus Antonius in 102 BC. Parts of Cilicia Pedias became Roman territory. Only a small part of that area became a Roman province. Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus was given the command of fighting piracy in Cilicia in 78‚Äì74 BC. He won several naval victories off Cilicia and occupied the coasts of nearby Lycia and Pamphylia. He received his agnomen of Isaurus because he defeated the Isauri who lived in the core of the Taurus Mountains, which bordered on Cilicia. He incorporated Isauria into the province of Cilicia Pedias. However, much of Cilicia Pedias belonged to the kingdom of Armenia. Cilicia Trachea was still under the control of the pirates.Broughton, T.R.S., The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol II, pp. 87‚Äì89. Slave trade One of the pirates main sources of income was slavery. Rome's economy had become dependent on slaves as Roman landowners held large plantations worked by them. Sicily was particularly notorious for its large Roman estates worked by slaves from all over the Mediterranean. When the Republic was not at war they needed an alternative supply; that's when they turned to the pirates who were Rome's most consistent supplier. This had the additional effect of powerful interest groups in Rome (mainly the business class) who lobbied for inactivity.Tom Holland, Rubicon, p.170. The island of Delos became the centre of the Mediterranean slave market; other markets included those of Rhodes and Alexandria. In its heyday, 10,000 slaves passed through Delos' markets in a single day. With the plantations came a harsher system of slavery and greater demand. Western Asia was the main supply, and was reduced by piracy and Roman tax farmers. Rome and the pirates By the 1st century BC, what began as a nuisance became a plague on the Mediterranean commerce. The Cilician pirates roamed across the entire Mediterranean, and began to attack the towns of Italy itself. In fact, even Ostia was plundered. Eventually Rome took action. In 102 BC the Romans sent Marcus Antonius the Orator to Cilicia with an army and a fleet. The pirates were no match for this onslaught so they fled, Antonius proclaimed victory, and the Senate awarded him a triumph. But the pirates merely regrouped on Crete, and soon returned to their old bases in Cilicia and piracy resumed. For over two decades Rome, occupied with other threats, ignored the problem again. In 79 BC Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus was allocated the province of Cilicia and a command against the pirates. From 78-74 BC he led a naval and land campaign against pirate bases in Cilicia (the land campaign was aimed at the Isauri). Although Servilius Vatia was awarded a Triumph he did not solve the problem; his campaign was only a temporary relief and after he left the pirate problem resurfaced. In 68 BC the pirates launched a raid at Ostia, barely fifteen miles from Rome, they sailed into the harbour and burned the consular war fleet. The port went up in flames. The grip of famine tightened around Rome. Starving citizens took to the Forum, demanding action.Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 173. Finally, after heated debate, Pompey was granted extraordinary powers to eliminate the Cilician pirates. Pompey divided the Mediterranean into thirteen districts, to each of which he assigned a fleet and a commander. Pompey then swept through the western Mediterranean with his own powerful fleet, driving the pirates out or into the paths of his other commanders. By keeping vigilance over all the sea at the same time (and at great cost), there was nowhere to run or hide. Those Cilician pirates that did escape fled to the eastern Mediterranean. Pompey completed this first part of his campaign in 40 days. Pompey then turned to the eastern Mediterranean. He gave mild terms to those pirates who surrendered to him personally, as opposed to his other commanders. Some pirates surrendered their ships, their families and themselves up to Pompey. From these, he learned about where others were hiding. Many pirates retreated to their strongholds of Asia Minor, where they gathered and waited for Pompey to attack them. At Coracesium Pompey won a decisive victory and blockaded the town. The Cilician pirates surrendered all their harbours and fortified islands. The Romans took the wealth the pirates had collected, and released many of their prisoners, (prisoners of worth whom the pirates intended to ransom); other prisoners were sold into slavery. Strabo writes that Pompey destroyed 1,300 pirate vessels of all sizes. Pompey spared numerous Cilician pirates who had been taken prisoner, realizing that many had been driven to such recourse by desperation. Those who surrendered were settled in various parts of the southern coast of Asia Minor, where the population was sparse. Settlements were created at Mallus, Adana, and Epiphaneia in Cilicia. Many were settled at Soli, which was thereafter called Pompeiopolis. The eastern campaign lasted 49 days. In total, Pompey's campaign removed the Cilician pirates, who had held a stranglehold on Mediterranean commerce and threatened Rome with famine, in a mere 89 days, the summer of 66 BC. Notable encounters=Quintus Sertorius When Quintus Sertorius, the renegade Roman general, was driven from Hispania, he fell in with Cilician pirates. Together they attacked and took Pityussa, the most southerly of the Balearic Islands, which they started using as a base. When the governor of Hispania Ulterior found out he sent a war-fleet and almost a full legion which drove Sertorius and the pirates from the Balearics. They regrouped in Baetica where the pirates decided to break with Sertorius and sail to Africa to help install the tyrant Ascalis (a man supported by Sertorius's Roman opponents) on the throne of Tingis. Sertorius followed them to Africa, rallied the Mauritanians around Tingis, and defeated Ascalis and the pirates in battle.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 58-61. Julius Caesar When Sulla died in 78 BC, Julius Caesar returned to Rome as a lawyer, prosecuted Sulla's supporters, and headed to the Greek city of Rhodes to study oratory. Pirates seized his vessel in 75 BC, kidnapped Caesar, and held him for ransom. Caesar felt insulted at the twenty talents (480,000 sesterces) ransom and insisted that the pirates raised the demand to fifty talents (1,200,000 sesterces) more suitable for his status; his retinue quickly raised the money in the local cities, before returning to the pirate stronghold. Caesar decided that he would crucify the pirates after he was free. After the money was paid and he was released he assembled a small army and a fleet, after which he captured the pirates and crucified them as he had promised while in captivity‚Äîa promise that the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut.James Thorne, Julius Caesar: Conqueror and Dictator, p. 15 Spartacus During the slave rebellion known as the Third Servile War, Spartacus was said to have brokered a deal with the Cilician pirates, hoping to smuggle a force of rebels across to Sicily. Sometime in 71 BC, the pirates deserted Spartacus and he had to give up his plans to cross over to Sicily. Publius Clodius In 67 BC, the Roman governor of Cilicia, Quintus Marcius Rex, sent his brother-in-law, Publius Clodius Pulcher, with a war fleet to patrol the coastline of his province. While on this patrol Clodius was seized by the pirates he had been sent to hunt down. Hoping to win his release, Clodius promised his captors a substantial reward, and they solicited a ransom from Ptolemy of Cyprus, an ally of the Romans. The amount offered was so paltry (two talents) that it was clear that Clodius had greatly overestimated his worth, the amused pirates released him anyway.Cassius Dio, xxxvi. 17.Appian, Bellum Civile, ii. 23.Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. II, p. 148.Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 169. Pirate culture Plutarch recounts a particular custom of the Cilician pirates. When a prisoner of theirs called out he was Roman, the pirates would pretend to be scared and beg for mercy. If the prisoner took the pirate's mockery in earnest, they would dress him in Greek athletic shoes and a toga, that they might not repeat the mistake. After they were satisfied mocking him, they would lower a ladder into the sea, and, wishing him a fortuitous journey, invite him to step off. If the man would not go of his own accord, they would push him overboard.Plutarch, Vita Pompeii 24.7-8. According to Plutarch, the Cilician pirates were the first to celebrate the mysteries of Mithras.Plutarch, Vita Pompeii 24.5. When some of these were resettled in Apulia by Pompey, they might have brought the religion with them, thus sowing the seeds of what would in the latter part of the 1st century AD blossom into Roman Mithraism.(See R.

The group was founded in the late 1960s and is currently composed of: * Jacobo Morales: actor, writer, director, comedian * Silverio P√©rez: musician, comedian, entrepreneur, host * Sunshine Logro√±o: comedian, actor, host, singer, producer Despite sporadic breaks in their tenure, the group has enjoyed constant success, having had several Puerto Rican television shows, and performing often around the island during their career. History Los Rayos Gamma began in the late 1960s as a project from journalist and writer Eddie L√≥pez. After finding out he suffered from cancer, he thought of a political parody where he could lampoon the current events of Puerto Rican politics, blaming all their wrongdoings and the parody itself on gamma rays (a pun on his current therapy against his illness). He then contacted friends Horacio Olivo, Silverio P√©rez and Jacobo Morales to help him with the project. Morales had the idea of taking Eddie's written parodies and blending them with previously censored TV scripts to produce a political parody stage show. The initial title of the project was El Efecto de los Rayos Gamma sobre Eddie L√≥pez (The effect of gamma rays on Eddie L√≥pez) which was a take on the title of Paul Zindel's play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds. The title was then shortened simply to Los Rayos Gamma. The show enjoyed great success from 1968 to 1971. That year, L√≥pez died from his illness and comedian Efra√≠n L√≥pez Neris was hired to replace him. However, at every show an empty chair would be left on stage as a tribute to L√≥pez. Shortly after, L√≥pez Neris was also replaced with comedian Sunshine Logro√±o. After that, the group decided to take an indefinite break. In the late 1970s, however, P√©rez contacted his friends to regroup. Enjoying the same level of success, they even had several programs on Puerto Rican television. The group has continued their shows around the island, while each member also pursues his individual endeavors. They roughly reconvene every two years, usually previous to an election year.  The group  The \\"classical\\" line-up of Los Rayos Gamma features them all dressed in black (as to not allude to any political party in Puerto Rico, or more precisely, their insignia's colors). It features Silverio P√©rez on guitar, Horacio Olivo (in his lifetime) in bongos and minor percussion, and Jacobo Morales using percussion only occasionally. A running gag among the group is that Morales can only sing by following visual cues (usually from Olivo, who was a strong percussionist and even danced onstage when propped) as to stay in rhythm; salsa singer Rub√©n Blades (who has sung onstage with the group in various occasions) joked about this by calling Morales \\"the black hole of clave\\". In reality, Morales can keep rhythm using clave sticks, or sing, but not do both at the same time. At the same time, Morales -for some unexplained reason, his partners claim- comes across as a very convincing tango singer. Logro√±o, on the other hand, besides using the group's common black uniform, may also feature distinctive props, usually those alluding to his own comedic characters (for example, Vitin Alicea's beret), depending on a song's lyrics. He may play guitar, minor percussion, or other instruments, again, depending on each song. The group's augmented lineup usually features a full orchestra, complete with horn section and chorus singers. It is frequently directed by keyboardist Jos√© \\"Cuqui\\" Rodr√≠guez, who was also the musical director of many of Logro√±o's comedy programs.  Recent years  On August 15, 2008, the group performed in the first of a series of reunion presentations in the Centro de Bellas Artes de San Juan. This was one of their \\"farewell\\" tour's presentations and included Vico C as special guest. On November 19, 2011, the group (without Horacio Olivo, who did appear in a comedic interview caught on video - he was recuperating from open heart surgery) performed in yet another series of presentations at the Centro de Bellas Artes de San Juan, this time billed as \\"Enfortu√±ados.\\" Olivo's death On July 24, 2016 original member Horacio Olivo died at 83 after health complications.

It is set in a world where Alaska was still owned by Russia in 1987. Background The story is an alternate history, set in North America, which is made up of several nations:map provided at beginning of book * United States of America (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, the western half of Maryland, Indiana, New Jersey, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, the majority of Illinois, and Quebec south of the St Lawrence River, with Mario Cuomo hinted as being President of the United States) * Confederate States of America (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, the southwestern portion of Illinois, the eastern half of Kansas, Cuba, and Hispaniola, with Jimmy Carter hinted as being a ranking member of its military) * Republic of Texas (Texas, Oklahoma, and the majority of New Mexico) * First People's Nation (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, the western half of Kansas, the central and southwestern portion of Ontario, and the southernmost portion of Manitoba) * Deseret (Utah and the northeastern portion of Nevada) * Republic of California (California, Oregon, the a small portion of western Arizona, Baja California, and the majority of Nevada) with its capital in San Francisco and Ronald Reagan hinted as its President. (A possible incongruity, as he was born in our timeline in Tampico, Illinois, which remains part of the United States.) Its air force operates the P-61 Eureka depicted in the cover art. * French Canada/New France (Quebec north of the St Lawrence River, Newfoundland, Labrador, and the northeastern portion of Ontario) * British Canada (Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Washington, the northwestern portion of Ontario, the southeastern portion of the Yukon Territory, and the majority of British Columbia and Manitoba) * New Spain (Mexico and Central America, Jamaica, the majority of Arizona, and the western portion of New Mexico) * Danish America (Greenland) * Russian Amerika (Alaska, the majority of the Yukon Territory, and the northwestern portion of British Columbia) The reasons for this different political environment is only hinted here and there in the story, but apparently the Point of divergence is that the Civil War started in the 1850s and resulted in a victory by the Confederacy. As a post-war consequence, the US loses all ground west of the Mississippi River as American-claimed western lands secede from the Union and create their own sovereign countries in the wake of the victorious South. With the dissolution of most of its territories and influence, the United States is reduced to a struggling collective of the Great Lake and Northeastern states surrounded by hostile and powerful neighboring countries. With its economy devastated in the aftermath of the war, the US is unable to buy Alaska from Russia, so it remains a commonwealth colony throughout the 19th and 20th century. Not much further details about the new timeline is explained except for the geopolitical landscape changes of North America that continued to change from the new-found American nations skirmishing at border states, then Canada also dissolves into individual British/French/Native colonies and it is suggested in the sequel that Napoleon III conquered Quebec by the late 1800s. At the turn of the 20th century, without the US to interfere in the Gulf of Mexico, Spain reconquers and annexes Latin America relatively unopposed. Eventually, the American nations have managed to cease hostilities with one another and formed the North American Treaty Organization, an alternate version of the real-world NATO, but it is unknown if it is a quasi military alliance or a non-aggression pact. The altered history of the world is not explained as much as North America except for such important events, like that the World War I did happen, as it is called the Great War. The Russian Communist revolution failed two times as Vladimir Lenin has been either exiled or executed, which is unknown, but the Tsar did rule the Russian Empire with a ruthless regime regardless. At some point, the Tsar of Russia married the Crown Princess of Spain; what effect this had is not explained, but is hinted at having given the Russians great control in Europe for some time‚Äîfor Russia has developed a long-time alliance with Spain for it to re-establish its colonial empire on North America. The Second World War occurred in Europe, but it was another stalemated campaign similar to the First World War. The Japanese Empire had fought a war in the Pacific with the Republic of California after a surprise- attack on California's naval fleet in San Diego, a parallel to Pearl Harbor, but the altered Pacific War's outcome is left unanswered. Along with this altered timeline came a slowed development of technology keeping the world of July 1987 at a roughly 1940s level, as no jet engines, television, atomic weapons, nor computers were ever invented (with the exception of command logic machines), but helicopters do exist without turbine propulsion and the preferred means of telecommunications in this time is by VHF radio. Political changes were slow as well, for no international communities (the League of Nations or the UN) were established either, and some countries still practice human slavery. Plot History suggests that the year is Summer of 1987 as the book begins. Most of the plot follows a mixed-raced man named Gregori Grogorievich. A decorated but disgraced Imperial Russian Army Major, Gregori has left the military for a maritime life in Southeastern Alaska and has a sport fishing boat which he uses for charters and occasional smuggling. He is hired one day by a Tsarist government official to make a rendezvous with a mysterious woman named Valari Kominskiya, but things go badly. The official gets drunk and tries to rape Valari and kill Gregori, but the official is killed in self-defense and thrown overboard. As Gregori tries to find out how to get out of Russian Amerika with Valari for political asylum, he is betrayed by her, as Valari is actually a spy and a high-ranking officer in the Russian Army. Gregori is captured by the government and falsely charged with the murder of the official (who was actually Valari's superior) and with the attempted rape of Valari, leading to a sentence of life of hard labor on the Russian-Canadian Highway. After long winter months of being subjected to brutal slavery, he and a group of other prisoners are rescued by a band of native Alaskans and are taken into the wilderness to evade the Russian manhunters called promyshlennik sent to capture or kill the prisoners. It turns out that Gregori's native Alaskan rescuers are revolutionaries called the Den√© Republik that seek to liberate their Yukon lands and Alaska itself from Imperial Russia which has driven them away from their home for hundreds of years. The revolutionaries offer Gregori a place in their ranks to fight the Russians. Without much choice to go back to his old life, and longing to have a chance to get revenge for being betrayed by the tyranny and corruption of the Tsarist government, Gregori joins the Alaskan forces. Throughout the winter of 1987 and early 1988, he and the other group of prisoners who also agree to join and fight their common enemy, are trained under the Den√© to fight a guerrilla war against the Russian military scattered throughout Alaska while the Den√© begin establishing the foundations of their would-be democracy of the new Alaska. At first the rebels are outnumbered in the face of the Imperial forces, but after successful attacks against fortified colonial towns, capturing weapons, recruiting more people of Alaska against Imperialist rule, and military assistance from the US and California, it appears victory for independence is plausible. Although the war to liberate Alaska will go far beyond what Gregori expected of a revolution, from surviving and losing friends to the relentless pursuit from Valari partnered with a vengeful promyshlennik, traitors within the separatist Den√© itself, and the unforgiving frontier, to rallying international support for the cause to fight an all-out war against the wrath of the Russian Empire that would surely decide the future of all the nations of North America.

National Museum in Pozna≈Ñ, Date 1886.In German folklore, the Wei√üe Frauen (meaning White Women) are elven-like spirits that may have derived from Germanic paganism in the form of legends of light elves (Old Norse: Lj√≥s√°lfar). The Dutch Witte Wieven went at least as far back as the 7th century, and their mistranslation as White Women instead of the original Wise Women can be explained by the Dutch word wit also meaning white. They are described as beautiful and enchanted creatures who appear at noon and can be seen sitting in the sunshine brushing their hair or bathing in a brook. They may be guarding treasure or haunting castles. They entreat mortals to break their spell, but this is always unsuccessful. The mythology dates back at least to the Middle Ages and was known in the present-day area of Germany.  Origins  Wei√üe Frauen literally means \\"white ladies\\" in German. The association with the color white and their appearance in sunlight is thought by Jacob GrimmGrimm 1835, Chapter 32, pp 2-3. to stem from the original Old Norse and Teutonic mythology of alven (elves), specifically the bright Lj√≥s√°lfar. These \\"light elves\\" lived in √Ålfheim (part of heaven) under the fertility god Freyr.Bellows, p. 89; Crossley-Holland, pp. xx, 61. As mythology evolved, elves no longer lived in √Ålfheim but lived on earth in nature. The White Women also may represent ancient beliefs in ancestral spirits or older native goddesses and nature spirits. Jacob Grimm noted in particular they might come from Holda, \\"Berhta, white by her very name\\"Behrta as defined by Grimm, is more commonly known as Perchta or Berchta, per his description Chapter 31 p. 4 and Ostara. According to Grimm's Teutonic Mythology and to the Mythology of All Races Series, the enchantment under which they suffer \\"may be a symbol of the ban laid by Christianity on the divinities of the older faith.\\"Marshall Jones Company 1930:221-222, citing in footnote \\"Grimm [a] 962f\\" (Grimm's Teutonic Mythology). Similar in name to the Witte Wieven of Dutch mythology, the Wei√üe Frauen may have come from the Germanic belief in disen or land wights and alven.Reginheim 2002.

History Islewilde was founded in 1992 by UMO, a Vashon Island-based physical theater troupe, who patterned Islewilde loosely after Vermont's Bread and Puppet Theater. The philosophy behind the festival is that communal creation of art helps to foster a vibrant community. \\"Community Creating Art Creating Community\\" is a slogan of the group. UMO spent four years actively organizing Islewilde before handing it off to members of the Vashon arts community, who have run the festival since with limited continuing involvement from its founders. While initially designed primarily with the Vashon Island community in mind, the festival has attracted and retained both national and international celebration artists, including, notably, members of Seattle's Fremont Arts Council, Minneapolis' In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre, Olympia's Procession of the Species, and Taiwan's Dream Community. Islewilde is notable in that there is no exchange of money during the festival weekend. There is no admission charge (there is a fee to take associated workshops) and often a community dinner is served. Structure of Festival= Theme At an annual community Dream Retreat a theme is brainstormed that becomes the guiding concept for that year's festival. Themes often center around Vashon life, especially as related to it being an island, but themes have also been about national political issues or been whimsical. Workshops For two weeks prior to the event, Islewilde features workshops by which, through the learning and application of various theatrical, artistic, and celebratory crafts and skills, the festival is designed, built, and rehearsed. Typical workshops have included Mask Making, Giant Puppet Building, Lantern Making, Batiking, Stilt Walking, Acting Troupe, Circus Troupe, Jug Band. During the workshop period, participants are encouraged to camp and eat together to form a creative village. Friday Night Illuminated Show Islewilde traditionally begins on Friday evening with a community Lantern Walk through the festival grounds, currently Vashon's Agren Park. Following the Lantern Walk is an illuminated show that has featured shadow puppets, illuminated giant puppets, fire spinning/dancing, etc. Saturday Shows The number and variety of shows change from year to year depending on the interests and energy of the community, but traditionally Islewilde puts on two feature shows: The Waterbucket Circus, a comic, faux circus; and The Islewilde Pageant, a theatrical piece that features a large cast of community members and large-scale, beautiful images and works of art, often including giant puppets. The Pageant is in keeping with the year's theme and generally has a storyline of positive community transformation after the community has been challenged by corruptive influences. On Saturday evening there has traditionally been an open-mic style cabaret show for those who have worked on the festival.

Among these early immigrants was Jan Nepomuk Kub√≠ƒçek, a Catholic carpenter from T≈ôebo≈à and one of the great-grandfathers of Juscelino Kubitschek, the 24th President of Brazil (from 1956 to 1961).F≈àukal, Milo≈° RNDr. Ph.D. - Region√°ln√≠ geografie Ameriky: Braz√≠lieOs quatro irm√£os - Do Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek In the 20th century there were three large waves of Czechs who moved to Brazil: in the 1930s, after the Communist takeover (1948) and after the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact troops (1968). Most of those immigrants settled down in Southern Brazil.Embaixada da Rep√∫blica Tcheca no Brasil - Rela√ß√µes Bilaterais Southern Brazil More or less influence of the Czech immigration can be noticed in the three states of Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina, Paran√°, and Rio Grande do Sul).

The film covers 25 years in the life of a college football hero. It stars Dennis Quaid, Jessica Lange, Timothy Hutton and John Goodman. Plot Gavin Grey (Dennis Quaid) is a 1950s star athlete known by the moniker \\"The Grey Ghost,\\" who plays football at the [fictional] University of Louisiana. His campus girlfriend Babs Rogers (Jessica Lange), nephew Donnie (Timothy Hutton) who also goes by the nickname \\"Cake,\\" and teammate Ed Lawrence (John Goodman) adore his personality and charm. During the Sugar Bowl game, Gavin's play, defining his competitiveness throughout his career, causes a player from the opposing team to fumble the ball, which he returns to score a game-winning touchdown. As his college days come to an end, Gavin ends up marrying Babs, starts a family, and gets drafted by the Washington Redskins. Lawrence opens a popular sports bar in Baton Rouge. Everyone is pleased for Gavin, including his friendly rival Narvel Blue (Carl Lumbly), who might have achieved professional stardom had he chosen an athletic career path. Reality quickly sets in for Gavin as life in the NFL is difficult, the competition is fierce, and the schedule is grueling. Gavin is a respectable running back for the Washington Redskins, but hardly the idol worshipped by everyone back home during his school years. Concurrently, Lawrence has accrued a number of gambling debts. He is later murdered by unidentified attackers, creating more debts for Gavin and Babs, who had invested in Lawrence's business. Babs does her best to keep up with her husband's career and mood swings, and in doing so inherits the role of the wage earner in their household. A sympathetic Donnie finds her frustrated and lonely, as his lifetime attraction to her brings them together for a brief extramarital affair. Gavin's financial setbacks encourage Babs to seek a job from Narvel to manage his restaurant. After a brief retirement, money issues convince Gavin to accept a comeback offer from the Denver Broncos. The new NFL has passed him by though and Gray is forced to accept that his playing days are over. He enters a failed business relationship with entrepreneur Bolling Kiely (Ray Baker), whom he despises, spending countless hours telling old college football stories to clients. Donnie moves on with his life, becoming an author and getting engaged to a sophisticated woman named Leslie Stone (Patricia Clarkson), while supporting Gavin and Babs through a marital breakdown. A lost and pathetic figure in the end, Gavin mends his relationship with Babs as he spends his withdrawal from professional sports reminiscing about his famed athletic youth.

A key scene featuring a candlelight parade involving large numbers of extras was filmed, on the steps of the Louisiana State Capitol, when snow started falling. Despite the beauty of the scene, director Taylor Hackford elected to reshoot the scene, as snow in Baton Rouge in November was such a rare event that he was worried it would be seen as a special effects goof in the film. The game scenes were shot in LSU's Tiger Stadium during the halftimes of actual LSU games in 1987. The goalposts were altered to resemble the vintage \\"H\\" posts as needed during filming. Vertical posts were moved in place for the bottom portion of the H, and a multi-colored fabric covering was used to conceal the \\"modern\\" center support post. Upon completion of filming, the vertical posts and fabric were retracted so as not to interfere with the LSU games. In late 1993, LSU installed an updated model of the vintage posts permanently in the stadium. Some of the filming of the football scenes took place during halftime of the LSU-Alabama game on The producers wanted to continue shooting some scenes following the game, so they requested that the LSU fans remain after the game so that they could finish the scenes. However, Alabama won in and ten minutes after the game, the only fans still in the bleachers were wearing crimson, forcing the producers to finish shooting the following week (November 14) following LSU's game with Mississippi State, Michael Apted was all set to direct Thomas Rickman's script in 1982 until Warner Bros. balked at the $16 million price tag, leading man Tommy Lee Jones and the fact that American football movies never do any business overseas. During its six years in development hell, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, and Robert De Niro all circled the project. Despite the fact that the novel was written about the University of North Carolina (which refused to allow filming because they suspected the story defamed campus legend Charlie \\"Choo Choo\\" Justice), when it was filmed at LSU, rumors started that Gavin Grey was based on the former LSU All-American Billy Cannon. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1959 and played eleven seasons for three professional teams, but served two and a half years in federal prison in the mid-1980s for his role in a counterfeiting ring. Deford himself denies this, saying: \\"Never met Cannon and knew nothing about him personally,\\" he says. \\"Gavin was strictly a composite of many athletes from several sports that I had covered.\\" The film contains a much more hopeful and upbeat ending than the book, where Gavin takes his own life after trying to kill Babs as well. Reception Reaction to the film was mostly mixed, as Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 42% rating based on 31 reviews.

The school was formed by Allaudin Khan in the princely state of Maihar, now lying in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, and hence the name. Allauddin Khan learnt music from Wazir Khan, an exponent of the Senia gharana. The Maihar gharana is therefore sometimes referred to as the Maihar-Senia gharana. It is one of the most prominent gharanas of the 20th century; much of the fame of Hindustani classical music in the west stems from this gharana. Prominent musicians belonging to the Maihar gharana include prominent sitar players Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, Allauddin Khan's son sarod player Ali Akbar Khan, daughter Annapurna Devi and grandsons Aashish Khan, Dhyanesh Khan, Pranesh Khan, Rajesh Ali khan, Alam Khan, Manik Khan and Shiraz Ali Khan. Other prominent musicians with links to this gharana include the sarod player Bahadur Khan, Sharan Rani, Vasant Rai, Rajeev Taranath, Shamim Ahmed, Gourab Deb, Damodar Lal Kabra, Apratim Majumdar, Vikash Maharaj, Abhisek Lahiri, and Basant Kabra, violinist V.

Musicians belonging to the gharana adhere to a dhrupad aesthetic in their approach to playing the alap and jor portions in a raga. Variations in tempo are used to demarcate sections while playing the jor, with a short rhythmic figure indicating closure of a section. Therefore, rhythmic figures within the jor assume structural importance. Alap-jor is followed by a khayal style vilambit gat with taan improvisations, and the performance ends with a jhala.

However, Kramnik's loss in a classical game against Ivanchuk during the tournament left him in a distant third with only two months remaining. The World Cup set the stage for the next major tournament, the Isle of Man Open, which both Caruana and Kramnik were playing. The first round pairings were decided by the players drawing names out of a raffle tumbler. Kramnik, choosing second because he was the 2nd- highest rated player at the event, chose Caruana as his first round opponent. With the white pieces, Caruana defeated Kramnik to put himself and So in a good position to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. Kramnik's surprise loss to James Tarjan, who quit chess for a few decades to become a librarian, further helped solidify Caruana and So as the ratings qualifiers. Furthermore, Kramnik ended up receiving a wild card into the Candidates event, officially clinching the qualifications for Caruana and So. In December 2017 with the Candidates qualification already decided, Caruana rebounded and won his only tournament of the year at the London Chess Classic in tiebreaks. He won three games and drew the remaining six (+3-0=6). Ian Nepomniachtchi had the sole lead entering the final round after winning three consecutive games in rounds six through eight.

The tournament was suspended halfway through due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the postponement, Caruana was tied for third place out of eight players with a score of 3.5 out of 7.  Playing style  As a youth, Caruana had an aggressive style of play. He later said \\"I preferred to attack all the time and really loved sacrificing pieces to get at the enemy king. I played like that for quite a long time, but when I moved up it turned out that you can far from always win with a direct attack; ... I had to become universal, to learn to manoeuvre and defend and so on.\\" Caruana's playing style is now universal, based on opening preparation and calculation: \\"I wouldn't assess it in such categories [tactical or strategic]. It seems to me I'm a good fighter. I enjoy playing different types of position, both tactical and strategic. I can't say there's anything I avoid. I can attack on a board full of pieces or manoeuvre in a roughly even position, and I've got nothing against the endgame.\\" Caruana is known as a hard working player, once saying: \\"Hundreds of games are played each day all around the world, and a lot of them are important. They're all available online, but you have to put in the time to look at them all. And you need to analyze, find new trends, keep trying to find new ideas to use against specific opponents.\\" Talking about Magnus Carlsen's play, Caruana hinted at his deep knowledge of the opponent's strengths and weaknesses: \\"In some positions you can't compete with him. Certain pawn structures he just plays like a machine. There are certain openings where I say, ‚ÄòI just can't do that.‚Äô But OK, certain positions he's not as comfortable with. Just like any player, he can also play unconfidently.\\"  Rapid and blitz rankings  In addition to his strength in classical time controls, Caruana is highly ranked in rapid and blitz chess. As of September 2019, Caruana is ranked 7th on the FIDE rapid listhttps://ratings.fide.com/top.phtml?list=men_rapid and 14th on the blitz list.https://ratings.fide.com/top.phtml?list=men_blitz  Federations and national championships = National Chess Federation membership  * Caruana is a \\"Benefactor\\" Life Member of the United States Chess Federation (USCF), and has been a member of the federation since the age of 5 in 1998.

It was the first in Canada to legally recognize the existence of unions and to force employers to negotiate with organized workers. It was drafted loosely on the American Wagner Act and is considered the framework for union rights in Canada. It was adopted under the War Measures Act, and was extended to cover all workers in Canada through adoption by Acts of all the provincial legislatures. This continued to be in effect until 1948, where the provinces all passed similar legislation within their respective jurisdictions. The regulations posed both positive and negative consequences for workers and unions alike. Some of the former included:Black, E; Silver, J (2008). Building a Better World: An Introduction to Trade Unionism in Canada (2nd ed.) Fernwood Publishing, Halifax and Winnipeg * Unions had guaranteed access to financial resources and support through the Rand formula, which required all workers under a union to pay union dues in exchange for a collective bargaining unit. * Union density increased dramatically following the end of World War II. * Unions were now legally recognized by federal law as a legal means of negotiating work terms and conditions with employers. * Workers won the right to share in gains of increased productivity via higher wages and benefits. * Promoted a virtuous cycle of production and consumption to produce economic growth based on Keynesian policies. * Created a grievance procedure that placed strict limits on management's ability to treat a worker in an arbitrary manner. Among adverse consequences there were the following:Haiven, L. PC 1003 and the (Non) Right to Strike: A Sorry Legacy\\". In Cy Years of PC 1003 (Winnipeg/Halifax: Society for Socialist Studies/ Fernwood Publishing, 1995) * Grievance procedures shifted power away from unions and collective workers to lawyers and arbitrators. * Unions became extremely bureaucratic and less radical.Panitch, L; Swartz, D. The Assault on Trade Union Freedoms: From Consent to Coercion (3rd ed.) Toronto: Garamond Press, 2003. * Workers agreed to Fordist/Taylorist working conditions and were expected to participate in increasing productivity. * Unions shifted focus away from mobilizing and educating their workforce about political affairs and began focusing on policing the workers and acting as a middle-man between workers and employers. * Union members became highly separated from the union representatives. * Attempts to create and maintain a distinctive working class culture were largely abandoned. * Wildcat and sympathy strikes were made illegal, and unionized workers had to follow an orderly fashion to engage in striking which meant no striking during periods of collective bargaining.

Oak Park map Economy Oak Park is located 4 miles (6 km) from San Diego State University. The community is home to a large mall, the Marketplace at the Grove Shopping Center, with anchor stores of Walmart, Target, Kohl's, Sam's Club and 24-Hour Fitness. The center originally opened as a traditional shopping mall called College Grove with anchors of JC Penney, Walker Scott, Sears, and various national chain retail stores. It was the first shopping center in central San Diego for the burgeoning community growing in the area in the Post-War era. Over the years, management changed hands and in the mid-80s briefly became The Grove and received a pastel- influenced makeover. By this time rent had increased sharply and one by one tenants left. Before the mall closed the center had only Mervyns, Longs Drugs, MANN Theaters, and a branch of the United States Post Office. Close to the end of the 1990s, a master plan was created to revitalized the dead mall, with ambitious plans including the redevelopment of the mall into strip mall with many big box retailers. Walmart, Sam's Club, Pic 'N' Save (Later Big Lots), Party City, and HomeBase opened in March 2000. Mervyns and Longs Drugs were the only hold overs from the original mall. In the next ten years HomeBase would become House2Home and eventually go bankrupt and be replaced by Target. Longs Drugs was acquired by CVS and closed. Mervyns went out of business in 2008 as a result of the late 2000s recession but by late 2009 was gutted and replaced by Kohl's. As of 2010, the shopping center sees daily full parking lots, a feat not even achieved by the mall in its prime. Community character Oak Park is characterized by single family homes, condominiums and apartments, as well as Navy housing. It is an established, stable community, demographically diverse and generally representative of San Diego. Oak Park is divided between City Council District 4 and District 7. It has a fire station and a branch of the public library. It has a strong community organization, the Oak Park Community Council. The jewel of Oak Park is Chollas Lake, a lake designated for free youth fishing (age 15 and under); a 0.8 mile dirt path around the lake for walking, jogging, and bicycling; picnic tables with barbecue grills; children's play equipment; a small basketball court; hiking trails; and a multi-purpose ball field in North Chollas canyon.

It is set in the present day and, latterly, the near future. It concerns the appearance of a heavy, prolonged fall of snow, which eventually blankets the earth in a layer of snow literally miles thick. Plot summary The heroine of the story, Tira, is an Indian Londoner who initially survives the snowfall by staying on the surface of the snow. Once the snow begins to bury even the highest buildings, she meets a worker from the London Underground and they both survive by sheltering in a high-rise office building and living off supplies that they have cached and can forage for. The worker later dies after falling off a chair and breaking his leg. Tira lives on her own for an unspecified period before being rescued by \\"snow miners\\" from the New United States of America (referred to as NUSA). The miners are looking for currency to use in NUSA, and have mistaken her location of \\"Bank\\" as being an actual bank. They take her to a floating city called 'Liberty', which rests atop the snow, buoyed up by large hydrogen balloons. There she chooses an arranged marriage with a former military man, now a politician, and it is suggested he will be the next President of NUSA. (The General is not named - all instances of his name are censored as the text is implied to be part of an official history.) Tira chooses him on the recommendation of \\"Pander\\", one of the generals sycophantic aides. Tira never knows Pander's real name, only referring to him by nickname as he effectively sells Tira to the general and panders to the General's every whim. To Tira's surprise, the relationship initially works, and although she does not love the General, he accepts this and she lives in relative luxury and comfort, Tira considering the General a fair trade to any alternative. While in Liberty Tira meets a repentant terrorist whose final attempt at terrorism - to kill the general by way of an exploding microphone - ironically ensured his survival as it meant he was stranded in the army base when the snow arrived, and thus the balloon city that became Liberty. She begins an affair with the terrorist, but is captured by the city police and taken to an internment camp in the depths of the snow. Pander arrives to identify her, but her inability to correctly name him coupled with her skin having returned to a darker brown from her pallid complexion after months under the snow means he leaves her in the prison. There she has several encounters with an alien race who, it is suggested, caused the snow and move through it as their natural medium. Eventually the General hears of her imprisonment and visits her personally, recognising and releasing her. During her time in the camp vast stores of food and fish have been located by the food miners - the food in warehouses deep under the snow, but still viable, and the fish in thermally heated pools, or artificially created lakes near power stations that are melting nearby snow due to unmaintained atomic pile.

Blanche Thebom (September 19, 1915March 23, 2010) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano, voice teacher, and opera director. She was part of the first wave of American opera singers that had highly successful international careers. In her own country she had a long association with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City which lasted 22 years. Opera News stated, \\"An ambitious beauty with a velvety, even-grained dramatic mezzo, Thebom was a natural for opera: she commanded the stage with the elegantly disciplined hauteur of an old-school diva, relishing the opportunity to play femmes du monde such as Marina in Boris Godunov, Herodias and Dalila.\\" While Thebom sang a broad repertoire which encompassed everything from Handel and Mozart to Verdi and Debussy, she was best known for her performances in the operas of Richard Wagner. Two Wagner roles with which she was particularly associated were Fricka in Die Walk√ºre and Brangaene in Tristan und Isolde. She notably sang the latter role in a famous 1952 recording made in London with Kirsten Flagstad, Ludwig Suthaus, and conductor Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler. In addition to several other recordings, she also appeared in two feature films during her career: Irish Eyes Are Smiling (1944) and, with Mario Lanza, The Great Caruso (1951). After retiring from the stage in 1967, Thebom worked as an opera director in Atlanta for 6 years. She then taught singing both privately and on the music faculties of the University of Arkansas and San Francisco State University. She also co-founded the Opera Arts Training Program of the San Francisco Girls Chorus and served on the board of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly four decades. Early life and education Born in Monessen, Pennsylvania, in 1915, Thebom was the daughter of Swedish parents who had immigrated to the United States. Her year of birth is sometimes incorrectly given as 1918. She was raised in Canton, Ohio, where she studied ballet and was active as a singer in her church's choir. She continued to take ballet lessons into her 40s. She completed business college and then took a job as a secretary at an industrial firm in Canton. In 1938, while working as a secretary, Thebom traveled with her parents to Sweden. During the boat trip from America to Europe, she was overheard singing in the ship's lounge by pianist Kosti Vehanen. Vehanen was Marian Anderson's regular accompanist and vocal coach, and he was highly impressed with Thebom's talent. Accordingly, he arranged for Thebom to become a pupil of Giuseppe Boghetti in New York, who was Anderson's voice teacher, and also eventually got her signed with talent manager Sol Hurok who also managed Anderson's career. After Boghetti's death in July 1941, she studied with retired Metropolitan Opera mezzo-sopranos Edyth Walker and Margarete Matzenauer in New York City. Early career and performing at the Metropolitan Opera Thebom's first prominent engagement as a performer came in November 1941 when she made her first appearance as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra and University of Pennsylvania Glee Club under conductor Eugene Ormandy at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. She then spent the next three years performing in concerts and recitals throughout the United States. She also sang at the Academy of Music for her professional opera debut on 28 November 1944; portraying the role of Brang√§ne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for an out of town engagement of New York's Metropolitan Opera. She repeated that role for her first appearance on the New York stage at the Metropolitan Opera House on the following 14 December. Thebom sang with the Metropolitan Opera for the next 22 seasons, giving a total of 357 performances with the company during her career. Her most frequent role at the Met was Amneris in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida; a part she played in 80 performances opposite such Aidas as Gloria Davy, Florence Kirk, Zinka Milanov, Herva Nelli, Delia Rigal, Antonietta Stella, Renata Tebaldi, and Ljuba Welitsch among others. She also excelled in Wagner's operas at the Met, portraying the roles of Erda in Das Rheingold, Magdalene in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Ortrud in Lohengrin, Venus in Tannh√§user, Waltraute in G√∂tterd√§mmerung, and Fricka in both Die Walk√ºre and Das Rheingold. In 1951 Thebom appeared as Dorabella in the premiere of Alfred Lunt's popular English-language production of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte at the Met. She also appeared in two United States premieres at the Met; singing the roles of Baba the Turk in Igor Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (1953) and Adelaide in Richard Strauss' Arabella (1955). Other roles she performed at the Met included Adalgisa in Norma, Azucena in Il trovatore, Dalila in Samson and Delilah, Eboli in Don Carlos, Genevi√®ve in Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Giulietta in The Tales of Hoffmann, Herodias in Salome, Klyt√§mnestra in Elektra, Laura Adorno in La Gioconda, Marfa in Khovanshchina, Marina in Boris Godunov (1956) ,Opera News, Volume XX: Number 18: March 5, 1956 the Old Baroness in Vanessa, Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus, and the title roles in Carmen and Mignon. Her final performance at the Met was as the Countess in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades on March 6, 1967. That was the only production that she appeared in at the then newly built Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Other performance work Outside of the Met, Thebom had actively performed as a guest artist with opera companies throughout the United States and abroad. In 1946 she made her stage debut in Chicago as Brang√§ne with the Chicago Opera Company. She made her debut with the San Francisco Opera (SFO) the following year singing Amneris to the Aida of Stella Roman. She was heard frequently in San Francisco through 1963; notably portraying the role of Mother Marie in the United States premiere of Francis Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites at the SFO in 1957. Other roles she performed in San Francisco were Brang√§ne, Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro, Carmen, Dalila, Fricka, Giulietta, Laura Adorno, Marina, Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier, and Orfeo in Orfeo ed Euridice. She also sang Dalila to the Samson of Giovanni Martinelli at the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company in 1950.New York Public Library for the Performing Arts: Folder: Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company Thebom made her European debut in 1950 as Dalila at the Royal Swedish Opera (RSO). She returned to the RSO several times, singing such roles as Amneris, Eboli and ‚Äî in what The Times described as \\"a not especially successful attempt at a soprano role\\" ‚Äî as Elisabeth in Tannh√§user. She made her first appearance in the UK with the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in the Summer of 1950 as Dorabella. In 1957 she came to London to sing Dido in the much lauded 1957 production of Hector Berlioz's Les Troyens at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. It was the first time that this opera was staged by a professional company. In this production she made effective use of her spectacularly long hair, allowing it to fall down her back as she ascended the funeral pyre at the end. In 1957, at the pinnacle of the Cold War, Thebom became the first American to perform at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, where she portrayed the title role in a three-week run of Carmen. She soon after gave a concert tour of Russia. She also gave performances in Greece, including a concert in front of the Parthenon with thousands in attendance. In 1960 she appeared at the Dallas Opera as Ruggiero in a celebrated production of George Frideric Handel's Alcina, with Joan Sutherland in the title role. In 1964, Thebom portrayed the Countess Geschwitz in Alban Berg's Lulu for the Opera Group of Boston. She also portrayed Prince Orlofsky (1965 and 1967) and Brang√§ne (1967) with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company.Free Library of Philadelphia: Bound: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1955-1974 Post opera career Upon her retirement from the Metropolitan Opera in 1967, Thebom no longer appeared on the opera stage. However, she did periodically sing in concerts and recitals; notably appearing in several recitals with Eleanor Steber. In June 1967 she was appointed director of the opera division at the Atlanta Municipal Theatre. When that organization went bankrupt in 1969, she founded her own opera company: Atlanta's Southern Regional Opera. She remained General Director of that company until 1973 when it ceased operating. While working in Atlanta, Thebom began actively working as a voice teacher. She also appeared in summer theatre revivals of Broadway musicals in Atlanta portraying roles like the Mother Abbess in The Sound of Music. In 1973 she moved to Little Rock to join the music faculty at the University of Arkansas. She taught singing and was director of the opera program there until the Spring of 1980 when she was appointed director of the opera program at San Francisco State University (SFSU). While teaching at SFSU and later privately, Thebom served as chair of the Pacific Region Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions for fifteen years. In the late 1980s she co- founded the Opera Arts Training Program of the San Francisco Girls Chorus with Elizabeth Appling. She continued to lead that organization up into the early 2000s. Several of the girls who attended the program later became professional opera singers. Thebom also served on the board of the Metropolitan Opera from 1970‚Äì2008, and was a judge for the national level of the Miss America pageant. At the age of 94, Blanche Thebom died of heart failure at her home in San Francisco on Tuesday, March 23, 2010.

Career Gosani started off at Drum magazine as a messenger but soon moved to the photographic department where he became J√ºrgen Schadeberg's darkroom assistant. He later became one of Drum's best photographers. Schadeberg said that \\"Gosani stood out because in the early 1950s good black photographers and press photographers in particular were unheard of\\". Some of his pictures have become iconic images of the 1950s in South Africa e.g. the picture of Women during the Defiance Campaign in 1952, Nelson Mandela sparring with his boxing club's star boxer of the time, Jerry Moloi (taken on the rooftop of the South African Associated Newspapers office in Johannesburg) and Nelson Mandela outside court in 1958, (triumphant because the prosecution had withdrawn charges in the Treason Trial). Perhaps his most famous sequence of pictures was the sequence he took of the humiliating and degrading Tauza dance that naked prisoners were forced to perform in the courtyard of the notorious Johannesburg prison, The Fort, in Hillbrow. This dance was a humiliating way of ensuring that the prisoners were not smuggling any weapons or contraband into their cells after a day's hard labour. It essentially involved thrusting their rectums up into the air for inspection by the warders. Gosani managed to photograph the Tauza dance secretly from the top floor of a nurses' home overlooking the prison. As a result of the pictures being published in Drum, there was a public outcry and the apartheid government was forced to act. Publications=Publications by Gosani  *Tauza - Bob Gosani's People.

The share of the budget dedicated to education has remained high during the past decade, averaging between 14 and 20% of the total government expenditure and as of 2000 it is 32.8 percent. The education expenditure is 9.6 percent of GDP for the year 2001 as seen in the chart below. In the strategic vision for the next 25 years since 2000,the government has committed to bring significant changes in the education system, thereby reducing illiteracy to less than 10% by 2025. Although Yemen's government provides for universal, compulsory, free education for children ages six through 15, the more U.S. Department of State reports that compulsory attendance is not enforced. The country ranked 150 out of 177 in the 2006 Human Development Index and 121 out of 140 countries in the Gender Development Index (2006). In 2005, 81 percent of Yemen's school-age population was enrolled in primary school; enrollment of the female population was 74 percent. Then in 2005, about 46 percent of the school-age population was enrolled in secondary school, including only 30 percent of eligible females. The country is still struggling to provide the requisite infrastructure. School facilities and educational materials are of poor quality, classrooms are too few in number, and the teaching faculty is inadequate. right Source:World Bank History of Education Girls in school, Sana'a, 2013 According to Yemen's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2002, basic education is still unable to provide for all children of schooling age (6-14). Yemen's primary school enrollment rates have increased from 73 to 87% for males and from 28 to 63% for females between 1991 and 2004. The main educational problems in Yemen are a weak education system, population dispersion, insufficient public funding, lack of the institutional capacity necessary to efficiently deliver basic education services, and the need of children to work to support their families are the main factors that deter children from attending schools. There are also social factors contributing to deterring children, and girls in particular from attending school, such as long distance from the school, lack of transportation, and single-sex schools in rural areas, low levels of teacher training and qualification, gaps in enrollment between boys and girls, weak institutional capacity from the Ministry to school levels, and low community participation The government's effort for education started in 1962 when the Yemen Arab Republic was established. During the 1970s, Yemen saw an expansion of basic education; however, there was a certain disparity between North and South, and they adapted very different education policies until its unification in 1990. Traditionally, North Yemen has been a much closed society and education was limited only to religious schools where children memorized the Koran, or to schools run by local initiatives. However, not all children could have access to these schools, and the majority of the students were boys, while few girls attended. The development of education in South Yemen began in 1967 after British withdrawal. During the British occupation of South, education was available only in Aden. Primary and intermediate schools existed in each small township of Steamer Point, Crater, Shaikh Othman, etc. There was only one girls‚Äô secondary school in Khormaksar and two private schools were in Crater and Steamer Point During the 1970s, several education plans were made for the new republic and the educational situation of the South had really taken off that of the North. The education system in the north adapted 6-3-3 (6 years of primary school, 3 years of preparatory, 3 years of secondary). The south also adapted the same education system; however, it changed to 8-4 (8 years integrated school, 4 years of secondary school). Secondary education had a choice of academic, vocational, technical or teacher training education. After the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990, these two education systems were merged into a single system, and 9-3 (9 years of basic education, 3 years of secondary education) was adapted. Along with that, enrollment was diversified into the science and literary tracks in grades 11 and 12. The unified Yemen was facing several educational problems such as lack of a budget for education, lack of government leadership, lack of Yemeni teachers, overcrowding and inefficiency in management. In the same year as its unification, the World Conference on Education for All was held in Jomtien, Thailand. In response to this conference, Yemen's Ministry of Education had developed several national education strategies with the cooperation of the World Bank and donor countries. Education Management System There are several ministries that manage the education system at different levels. General education is under the purview of Ministry of Education). Vocational schools and community colleges are managed by the Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training. The tertiary education is regulated by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. There is also a small private sector that accounts for 2% of basic and secondary each and 15% of university enrollments for the year 2005. The Government of Yemen has subsidized public schooling at all levels. Most of the expenditure increase in the education sector is allotted for post secondary education. This expenditure increase led to greater expansion of education services. From 250,000 students in the 1970, there are now about 4.3 million students in basic education. In addition, between 1996 and 2004, enrollment increased at secondary level from 324,000 to 595,000 students and at the university level from 104,000 to 201,000 students. Recently, Government of Yemen launched an exercise to improve communication and coordinate policies among the three ministries so as to have a more integrated vision for education. The government has also worked in collaboration with the Governments of Netherlands, Germany and the UK, and also with multi-donor organizations, such as the World Bank, DFID and Canadian International Development Agency to make substantial improvements in the education system at all levels. Basic Education In Yemen the basic education comprises 9 years of basic compulsory education for children of ages between 6‚Äì14 years old. The government has developed the National Basic Education Development Strategy in 2003 that aimed at providing education to 95% of Yemeni children between the ages of 6‚Äì14 years and also to decrease the gap between males and females in urban and rural areas.

The government increased public expenditure for basic education and allocated a share of 17.2% of the public expenditures in 2003, and 16.97% in 2004 which are about 4.5% of the GDP. Basic education schools increased from around 9930 schools in 2000 to 10293 schools in 2002 and 10684 in 2004. The number of classrooms also showed an increase from 97,462 classrooms in 2003 to 98329 in 2004. In particular, more than two thirds of the number of schools and classrooms including private schools were built in rural areas. The increase of gross enrollment rate is contributed to special consideration such as exemption of school fee or school feeding programs for the children from poor families. These programs supported 106,169 girls in 1272 schools. In 2004, a dry meals service was operated and 248,244 girls in the basic education level were included in this service. These projects contributed to improve enrolment rate in the basic education level (6‚Äì14 years) up to 72% for boys and 42% for girls in 1999[21]. In 2004, the enrollment rate increased to 87% for boys and 63% for girls. In Yemen, only about one-third (36%) of 10- to 14-year-old working children attend school, compared to 58% of non-working children. This is even lower for girls. Girls‚Äô retention at the basic education level is a major problem; out of every 100 girls who join basic education in Grade 1, only 25% will complete Grade 9, thereby limiting the intake at secondary level. center Source:World Bank Secondary Education After the nine years of primary education, students receive Intermediate School Certificate and attend secondary school for three years. In addition to normal secondary schools in which to prepare for university, technical secondary schools, vocational training centers, a veterinary training school, a Health Manpower Training Institute, and several agricultural secondary schools are available. There are also Islamic schools, and private schools. In normal secondary schools, students take a common curriculum during their first year, after that, students are given choice either the scientific or literary track. At the end of third year, students take examinations, and an 'Al Thanawiya'(General Secondary Education Certificate) is given to students who pass the examination. In the school year 1999-2000 was 439,129 boys and 324,493 girls‚Äô enrolled in secondary education. The secondary school system is still in need of proper management. Only 21% of the schools have more than 180 students (13% of rural and 47% of urban schools), which is the minimum number of students required to have a viable secondary school offering the two mandatory academic tracks. Also only 27% of the schools offered two parallel streams in grades 11 and 12. The provision of education by private sector is also not a viable option due to excessive regulatory barriers that limit private financing. Then the deployment of teachers is also inefficient. There are some schools with excess of some teachers of particular subjects, while there may be shortage of teachers of the same subjects in other schools. The education system also lacks formal professional teaching development program. In addition, the various ministries have no coordination in terms of teacher's development. Each year about 15,000 students with teaching degrees graduate from universities. Out of those 6000-7000 teachers are hired mostly in basic education. The gross enrolment rate for secondary education in Yemen is 45.6 percent in 2005.The regional average of Middle East and North African countries is 73.4 percent. Girls fare worse than boys particularly in rural areas. In 2006, the secondary school net attendance ratio NAR was 60.4% for male 55.7% for female, with a 17 percentage point difference between the urban and rural NARs for males and 25.9 percentage point difference for females. In July 2007 the Cabinet approved a National General Secondary Education Strategy that aimed to provide high quality secondary education for transition to tertiary education and the labor market in an equitable and cost effective manner. This strategy will work towards reducing both gender and geographic inequity in the attainment of secondary education. University Education University education is of 4 years except for Engineering and Medicine which requires 5 to 6 years respectively. There are 7 public universities in Sana‚Äôa, Aden, Hodeida, Taiz, Ibb, Dhamar, and Hadramaut (Mukallah) and 5 private universities and religious universities. Also, there are two community colleges in Sana‚Äôa and Aden. The enrollment in public universities is about 174,000 in 2005/06 and about 12,000 are enrolled in private universities (2005/06). Thanawiya examinations‚Äô results are very important for getting into university and the required score varies depending on each faculty. The percentage who pursues university education is less than 10 percent. In 2001, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research was established to meet the demand for social development. Every year, about 300-400 students who seek high quality of education go abroad for education. USA, U.K. and other European countries and India are popular countries for higher education. The National Strategy of Higher Education in 2006 also aims to provide multiple paths in the field of education. The higher education in Yemen still has a long way to go, despite high investment in this level the staff-student ratios are not favorable, equipment and learning resources are very poor; high absenteeism among professors; no systematic process to review and update the curricula; shortage of laboratories and computers for engineering students. Also there is a need of a decentralized system for the utilization of funds. Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) There are courses provided for the TEVT at the post basic and post-secondary levels. The government is making efforts to expand TEVT at various levels; nonetheless it is still relatively small, accounting for only one in 200 students at all levels and one in eight tertiary level graduates. Also less than one percent of the TEVT students are women. The private sector is also very small and limited to offering certain types of training and skill development programs. The TEVT system is also rigid, as most of the post secondary TEVT students are not offered any courses even in community colleges or universities. Then the only higher education option available to these TEVT graduates is to continue with up to three years of post-secondary education. There is a need to expand a number of employment opportunities in the country with increased public, private collaboration. In addition, the TEVT should be provided based on the current demand of the labor market rather than being more supply-driven. The new ministry is trying to improve its management system to be more effective through the National Vocational and Technical Education Strategy. Rising unemployment Unemployment is a major problem that needs to be dealt with as the population grows and education system struggles to keep up with the new demands in the labor market. In 1999 the youth unemployment stood at 18.7, and as elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa the unemployment in women with higher education was also very high. It was estimated, due to lack of labor force survey since 1999, the number of unemployed people could rise to a million in 2006 that is about 16.5% of labor force. Lack of skills of the labor force is also one of the main problems cited in Doing Business 2009, for private companies to set up businesses in Yemen. Girls' education  The girls‚Äô enrollment rate of Yemen is the lowest in Middle Eastern countries, and there is huge disparity between boys and girls, and between urban and rural areas. The low girls‚Äô participation in education is attributed to several socio-cultural factors. The tradition of early marriage in rural areas hinders girls‚Äô schooling and leads to high drop out rates. The chastity of girls has great importance in rural areas; therefore parents are unwilling to send girls to mixed gender schools. Also, negative social attitudes towards girls‚Äô education, and a lack of female teachers contribute to low female enrollment The limited number of schools, employment opportunities, overcrowding and a low quality of education discourages families from sending their girls to school. In addition, male teachers‚Äô conservative attitudes towards girls, the distance from schools in rural areas, a lack of books and teaching materials and parents‚Äô financial constraints limit girls‚Äô opportunities for education. Literacy According to the United Nations, the adult literacy rate for Yemen in 2007 is 40.5 percent for females and 77 percent for males. The overall literacy rate for the population of ages 15 and older was 49 percent. There has been improvement in literacy rate from 37.1 percent in 1994 to 58.9 percent in 2007. By comparison, low-income countries on average have an adult literacy rate of approximately 60 percent.

Biography Cottage garden, ca. 1790, Natchez, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1938. Home of the Foster family. At one time owned by Jose Vidal, acting Gov. of Natchez Territory Early life Don Jos√© Vidal was born on March 12, 1763, in A Coru√±a, Spain. Career He was secretary to Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, the Spanish Governor of the Natchez District from 1792-1797. He preferred to remain on Spanish territory, and petitioned the Spanish Governor-General Manuel Gayoso de Lemos for a land grant across the Mississippi River from Natchez. Gayoso granted the petition, with the stipulation that Vidal erect a ‚Äústrong house‚Äù (fort) on the property. In 1798 Don Jose moved his family from Natchez across the river and became the Commandant of the new Post of Concordia. Don Vidal also worked to develop a town at the fort, building the first steam-powered sawmill. He also owned a cotton gin and blacksmith shop ‚Äì facilities to support the town. Concordia Parish later derived its name from the fort, and the town was called Concord by 1801. The Orleans Territorial legislature in 1811 changed the name of the city to Vidalia after its founder. Vidal had donated land along the river to the city, where its civic buildings were later constructed. He also donated land for the first school in Concordia Parish. He lived most of his later years in Vidalia, although he went to New Orleans on business. Personal life He was married and had children. Death He died August 22, 1823, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was buried in the Natchez City Cemetery.

The tricks taught in Project Magic functions on several different levels, and were designed to help improve dexterity, coordination, visual perception, spatial relationships, and cognitive skills. There are specific magic tricks developed for varying disabilities. Another, and perhaps, more important benefit of Project Magic, is that it motivates the patients' therapy and helps them build self-esteem.Fisher, Deborah M., and Fisher, Cody S. (2007): 'Rehabracadabra', ADVANCE for Occupational Therapy Practitioners 23(15), volume 23, 15‚Äì18. Origin David Copperfield got the idea for Project Magic from a magician that he had been corresponding with for some time. Once, when Copperfield received a press clipping in one of the letters, he was surprised to learn from the photograph that the young man was in a wheelchair. \\"He had never referred to the fact that he was in a wheelchair,\\" explained Copperfield. \\"His own self-image wasn't one that had a disability.\\" This led Copperfield to wonder if magic could help recovering patients gain the same self-confidence. In February 1982, Copperfield brought his idea to the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, California, which was recognized by the National Association of Rehabilitation Facilities as the \\"outstanding rehabilitation center of 1981\\". The occupational therapy department quickly embraced the concept, realizing that it could offer other benefits beyond just bolstering the patients' self-image. Copperfield began collaborating with Julie DeJean, the hospital's director of occupational therapy, to develop tricks that could be applied to treat various disabilities. They soon discovered that Project Magic presented the patients with an alternative from the often painful and tedious hours of therapy, and motivated them to work harder than before. The participants also gained self-confidence by being able to do things that others could not. Structure The occupational therapists using Project Magic work in teams with local volunteer magicians. The magician first teaches the illusions to the therapists, then together, they instruct the patients on how to perform the illusions. The therapists then helps the patients to master the techniques involved during the following week. After a week, the magicians return and give advice on how to polish up the magical feat by using other techniques such as misdirection and the proper stage presence. \\"Project Magic is presently employed in hundreds of hospitals throughout the world,\\" comments Copperfield. \\"I am pleased to say that the American Occupational Therapist Association has endorsed this program as being an authentic therapeutic tool.\\" Unlike the figurehead of many other charitable organizations, Copperfield is directly involved with Project Magic. When his busy schedule permits, he works directly with the patients and gives seminars to introduce and discuss his form of treatment.

There are a multitude of opinions and views of the peace process elicited at various points during Israel's history and by a variety of people. A popular understanding of the origins of the conflict from the Israeli point of view is that it began following the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel's occupation of the territories and consequently the peace process negotiations should stem from this.Pappe, I., 2004, A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press However, there are other understandings of the conflict and therefore the solution for peace, including some Israeli academics' and peace activists' understanding that a much longer history is involved, differing from the popular narrative often recited.Slater, J., 2001, \\"What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Process\\", Political Science Quarterly, Volume 116 (2), pp 171‚Äì199 Suggestions for how to achieve peace in the region include a two state solution where an Israeli sovereign state and a Palestinian sovereign state exist side by side, or the suggestion of a one state secular solution where power is shared by Israelis and Palestinians. Hardliners believe that Israel should maintain sovereignty over the land it currently occupies and give no concessions to Palestinians, others believe keeping up the military campaign, occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and separation from Palestinians is the only current way forward. There is also a note of despair and uncertainness as to how to proceed among some, particularly following the failure of peace summits in the 1990s and early 21st century and the second Intifada, as Kaufman et al. have stated; \\"there is a growing consensus that the current political leadership are not able to build a stable peace and resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people\\".Kaufman, E., Salem, W. & Verhoeven, J., 2006, Introduction, in Kaufman, E., Salem, W. & Verhoeven, J. (eds), Bridging the Divide: Peacebuilding in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Conflict, London, Lynne Rienner Publishers, page 3 As Cowen says \\"almost everyone wants peace [but] on his or her terms\\" and this is the crux of the problem.Cowen, T., 2004, A road map to Middle Eastern peace ‚Äì a Public Choice perspective, Public Choice, volume 118, pp 1‚Äì10, page 2 The article looks at the views demonstrated in Israel following particular attempts to create peace between Israel and Palestinian groups; such as the Oslo Accords, the Camp David 2000 summit and the Road Map for Peace. Also scrutinized are the views of key Israeli political figures and public opinions at particular points. This article intentionally only focuses on Israeli points of view and not Palestinian views (see: Palestinian views of the peace process), it is not a history of the peace process (see: Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process) or the conflict (see: history of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict) and it specifically looks at the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and peace process and not Israel's relations more generally with the Arab world (see: Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict; history of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict). Almost every Israeli prime minister has called for peace talks with moderate Arab leaders over the years. Narratives of the conflict The understanding given to the history of events between Israelis and Palestinians has a bearing on the solutions sought for peace and how far each side is prepared to compromise to create a peace deal. Traditional narrative What Slater terms the \\"traditional narrative\\" and Pappe calls the \\"common version\\" essentially refer to where Israelis place themselves in relation to Palestinians and the wider Arab world and in a particular version of past events. This \\"traditional\\" or \\"common\\" narrative, as the terms suggest, is both popular and well established in the mindset of many Israelis, both civilians and politicians alike and others outside of the state, particularly in the West. The narrative broadly holds that in the 1940s the Arabs were unwilling to negotiate and it was they who instructed their people to flee in 1948 creating the refugee problem that persists today. That there are a group of Palestinians who are terrorists who wish to destroy Israel and that the Palestinians are too demanding in their peace negotiations which reflects extremism within Palestinian society, and although the destruction of Israel was initially an aim of groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and remains one for some such as Hamas, just as the idea of creating an Israeli state covering the occupied territories remains an aim for some Israelis, this has largely been rejected as an aim now and the PLO officially recognised Israel in 1988.Ben-Ami, S., 2005, Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: the Israeli‚ÄìArab Tragedy, London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson Part of this traditional narrative is the belief that the causes of the conflict lie in the 1967 Six-Day War and consequently peace discussions should form around the discussion of territorial negotiation. Such a narrative leads to certain assumptions about what is acceptable in peace creation and influences how Israelis who hold this perception view the peace process. Slater goes as far as to say that, in his opinion, the conflict continues partly as a result of this \\"mythology\\" of Israel's situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian \\"other\\".Slater, J., 2001, \\"What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Process\\", Political Science Quarterly, Volume 116 (2), pp 171‚Äì199, page 172 New narrative There is an alternative to this traditional narrative: a growing scholarship from Israeli academics and peace activists looking at the history of relations between Israel and Palestine has developed what has become known as a \\"new history\\". Ilan Pappe's work referenced here can be considered part of this trend. It has reassessed Israel's role in conflict creation and continuation, demonstrating an awareness of both Israeli and Palestinian roles in the process. As a result of its understanding that the conflict reaches back beyond the Six-Day War, the narrative recognises different causes for the conflict to be beyond Palestinian anti-Semitism and towards Zionism's insistence on creating a Jewish state in Palestine for example, and consequently views the peace process differently; less fearfully of Palestinian intentions and more sympathetically to Palestinian wishes. Responses to peace attempts The response by Israeli politicians and the general public to high-profile peace attempts give an indication of how these events, and therefore the peace process, have been viewed. Although separated here these peace process events are part of an ongoing process of negotiations, changing events and opinions. The Oslo Accords See Oslo Accords for details of the agreement. Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton, and Yasser Arafat at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony on 13 September 1993 The agreement made in Oslo in August 1993 between Israel and the PLO was seen as a great step forward by many, although views of the Accords were not homogeneous. Some hailed Rabin's concession to consider the option of Palestinian self-rule as a welcome move towards peace and away from his hardliner background, others, both within rightwing Israeli politics and sections of society saw it as too great a concession on Israel's behalf. This view is demonstrated by the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by a rightwing radical Yigal Amir who opposed his signing the Oslo Accords and served to highlight the differences in opinion held within Israeli society as to the direction the peace process and consequently Israel should take.Yakan, M.Z., 1997, \\"From War to Peace: Obstacles, Prospects, and Implications of the Middle East Peace Process\\", in Karsh, E. (ed), From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda, London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd Suspicion of the reason for Palestinian agreement was held by a few who maintained the view that Palestinians wanted to destroy the state of Israel and that they would not attempt to keep the peace. The continued and increased attacks by some sectors of Palestinian society did nothing to aid the view that the Palestinians would not keep their side of the deal. Israeli commentators lay blame for the failure of the Oslo Accords at Yasser Arafat's door believing his leadership to be corrupt and dictatorial rather than looking at events of Israel's making. The Oslo Accords, like previous talks had avoided key issues and the view of peace put forward by Israeli negotiators remained based on the notion of limited sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank without resolving the right to return of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 conflict avoided the longer term view of the causes of the conflict. The issue of Israeli settlements was not concluded, and the extensive building that took place following the Oslo Accords was cited as evidence that the views of Rabin and Israelis in power who did not act in the \\"spirit of Oslo\\".Slater, J., 2001, \\"What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Process\\", Political Science Quarterly, Volume 116 (2), pp 171‚Äì199, page 177 The issue of settlements throws up the particular and fairly extreme view of the religious- right in Israel at the time that believed negotiating over territory and the possibility of Palestinian self-rule in the religiously symbolic territories undermined what it meant to be Israeli.Jones, C., 1997, \\"Ideo-Theology: Discourse and Dissonance in the State if Israel\\", in Karsh, E. (ed), From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda, London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd Settlers also viewed the peace process at this point as a threat due to the possibility that their homes and livelihoods would be at risk. The initial building of settlements and the continuation of such schemes, despite the Oslo Accords rhetoric demonstrates that those at the top of Israeli politics did not seriously envisage creating a viable Palestinian state as part of the peace process. For citizens outside the nationalist right the period around the Oslo Accords represented a time when negotiation over territory became acceptable on the understanding that the alternative was the probability that Israel would have to lose either its liberal democracy or Zionist identity.Barnett. M., 1999, \\"Culture, Society and Foreign Policy Change: Israel's Road to Oslo\\", European Journal of International Relations, Volume 5 (1), pp 5‚Äì36 Camp David 2000 Summit See Camp David 2000 Summit for detail of the summit. The Camp David summit in the summer of 2000 involving United States President Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, was an attempt to agree a deal to finalise issues that would create a peace settlement. Its outcome however was a deadlock and a rejection by Arafat of Barak's offer which offered most of Arafat's demands, withholding only the demand for sole Arab control over the temple mount, the demand for complete repatriation of millions of Arabs into Israel proper, and about 30% of the contested territory. According to Ben-Ami the left in Israel believed Barak and his team had not offered enough to the Palestinian‚Äôs to make it a viable option, and the right believed too many concessions were offered and that the failure of the peace process was what they had expected. A conflict of views on the peace process was clearly evident within Israel due mainly to traditional views on the character of Israel as a Jewish state, and a newfound desperation among some for peace at any cost. Israeli left wing analysts have since put forward a version of events that imply Barak and his team did not go far enough to allow Arafat to comply and that far from blaming Arafat for rejecting a reasonable offer they hold empathy with the Palestinian predicament. Slater's view is that: \\"despite the widespread misrepresentation that Ehud Barak offered Palestinians 'generous' peace proposals at Camp David, Israel is still resisting the creation of a genuinely viable and independent Palestinian state.\\"Slater, J., 2001, \\"What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Process\\", Political Science Quarterly, Volume 116 (2), pp 171‚Äì199, page 174 Highlighting the consistency throughout the peace process for him of a desire to maintain control over any threat to a Jewish state the Palestinians might have by controlling them. Barak did not acknowledge the role of Israel in the Palestinian refugee situation, highlighting his view of the peace process remains based in the traditional narrative understandings discussed at the top of this article. The collapse of the peace talks and the subsequent Second Intifada uprising left many Israelis to view the peace process as failing and having led to lives of greater insecurity and an increasing sense that the Palestinians ask for too much and offer violence in return and thus the two state solution with Israel's withdrawal to something like the 1967 borders that had seemed to be becoming a possibility became far more unlikely save for some academics and peace activists. Road Map for Peace See Road Map for Peace for detail of the negotiations. The Road Map for Peace was introduced by George W. Bush‚Äôs administration in co-operation with Russia, the European Union and the United Nations to try and instigate a phased path to peace. However the Road Map receive little genuine attention from either side of the conflict, other than, as Ben-Ami says, to keep the Americans onside, the real gain Israel received was the assurance of a removal of the military threats from other states in the region. Sharon‚Äôs rightwing government were not keen to see a true revival of the peace process after a couple of years of the violence of the Second Intifada and paid it little more than lipservice. Political figures' view points=Shamir Yitzhak Shamir, Israeli Prime Minister from 1983 to 1984 and again from 1986 to 1992 following a two-year spell as part of a coalition government between his Likud Party and the Labor Party, is considered one of the most hard-line Prime Ministers Israel has had. Accordingly, in a period of time where relations between Israel and other Arab states were beginning to shift and global changes were being witnessed towards the end of the Cold War, Shamir opposed shifts or compromise on the situation in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. His view of the peace process at a time when the PLO were moving towards recognition of Israel and a two state solution was that territory should not be part of the negotiation and consequently with the moving times and relations obvious at the peace talks in Madrid he felt both under siege and indifference according to Ben-Ami. Rabin Yitzhak Rabin, a hardliner who had two terms as Prime Minister, was instrumental in the continuation of settlements and did not wish for the peace process to go in the direction of Israeli and Palestinian states existing next door to each other. However it was he who suggested an exchange of an end to the first intifada in return for Palestinian autonomy at the end of the 1980s. When Prime Minister for the second time, it was also his role in negotiations at Oslo that led to the so-called breakthrough in the peace process, acknowledging the PLO and the move towards Israeli withdrawal from the territories. His plans after the Oslo accords of continued settlement and road building in the occupied territories demonstrated his true views on the peace process; not a desire to return to 1967 borders but a separation in some form of Palestinians from Israelis. However it is suggested by Slater that towards the end of his life he was moving toward the idea of some kind of Palestinian state. Rabin also saw peace as essential for Israel to build up its economy and not only that but peace to increase regional development and standards of living not just in Israel. Peres Shimon Peres Shimon Peres has held many posts within Israeli politics, including the role of Prime Minister. He is credited as being a key instigator in the occurrence of the Oslo Accords and held many similar views towards the peace process as Rabin.Bar-Siman-Tov, Y., 1997, \\"Peace-Making with the Palestinians: Change and Legitimacy,\\" in Karsh, E. (ed), From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel‚Äôs Troubled Agenda, London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd The Camp David negotiations in 2000 brought Peres' criticism for the making of too many concessions for the Palestinians. For he held that a viable Palestinian state should not be formed and consequently stepped up the move to make inroads into Palestinian territories. Netanyahu Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin Netanyahu became Prime Minister as leader of the Likud Party in 1996 and had an immediate effect, and an adverse one according to Yakan, on the peace process. He attempted to slow down the Oslo process in order to create better security and due to his severe reservations of it.Karsh, E., 1997, \\"Peace Despite Everything,\\" in Karsh, E. (ed), From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda, London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd Netanyahu is a recognised opponent of territorial negotiation and land for peace deals and he wanted results rather than declarations. The regard he and other Likud members held Rabin and Peres in following their negotiations with the PLO during the Oslo process demonstrates his view of the peace process as undesirable and as abandoning the notion of what Israel should be.Bar-Siman- Tov, Y., 1997, \\"Peace-Making with the Palestinians: Change and Legitimacy,\\" in Karsh, E. (ed), From Rabin to Netanyahu: Israel's Troubled Agenda, London, Frank Cass and Co Ltd He, like his successors in office, Barak and Sharon, believed that if the creation of some form of Palestinian state was completely unavoidable it should only be in the Gaza Strip, part of the West Bank, and Israel should remain the military and sovereign ruler over the settlements, all of Jerusalem and important points such as the aquifers. Barak Ehud Barak took office as Prime Minister in 1999 as leader of the Labor Party. His time in office and the decisions he made have been described as \\"schizoid\\" by Slater for the apparent changes in direction he took.Slater, J., 2001, \\"What Went Wrong? The collapse of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace Process,\\" Political Science Quarterly, Volume 116 (2), pp 171‚Äì199, page 179 He went further than any other Israeli Prime Minister in the deals he offered the Palestinians at Camp David, but he has himself described his loyalties to the rightwing‚Äîhe had opposed the Oslo agreements‚Äîonly making such peace offers out of pragmatism for the knowledge that controlling Palestinians was only going to lead to continued violence. After the failed negotiations and the concessions he offered, he continued to make reference to his desire for a Greater Israel. His view of the peace process therefore seem fairly contradictory and included placing importance on dealing with Israel‚Äôs relations with its neighbours such as Syria over dealing directly with Israel's relations with the Palestinians in a hope that the Palestinians would become isolated if peace was secured between Israel and Syria. It was only once this channel was exhausted that Barak would deal with Arafat and the Palestinians. An important view point of Barak's regarding the peace process is that there were no preconceived solutions to the process and negotiations; for him there was not an expectation that Israel would definitely withdraw to the 1967 borders for example, everything was under discussion in an open ended process. Sharon President George W. Bush, center, discusses the peace process with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, left, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Aqaba, Jordan, 4 June 2003. Ariel Sharon succeeded Barak as Prime Minister in 2001 and brought with him a rightwing government in the face of the violent period of the second intifada. His reluctance to implement the goals of the 'Road Map for Peace' demonstrated his unwillingness to negotiate and make gestures towards developments in the peace process. Indeed, Ben-Ami says that Sharon has always harboured a hidden agenda: \\"the sterilization of the Palestinian national movement‚Ä¶and the confinement of a Palestinian homeland within scattered enclaves surrounded by Israeli settlements, strategic military areas and a network of bypass roads for the exclusive use of the Israeli occupier.\\"Ben-Ami, S., 2005, Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: the Israeli‚ÄìArab Tragedy, London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, page 297 As Sharon views a Palestinian national movement as a threat to Israel and its 'Jewishness'‚Äô and consequently would rather allow an independent state, although militarily weak. The dismantling of settlements in Gaza, instigated by Sharon, represents not only an unprecedented step by Israel but also that Sharon had decided unilateral action rather than a two state negotiation was the way forward to move towards peace. Views from Israeli society Israel is characterised by a multitude of opinions and views of the peace process that vary across time as well as across society. There are right-wing opinions (both secular and religious) which believe Israel should not concede to Palestinian demands and instead should maintain the original Zionist vision of Israel. There are those that hold left-wing viewpoints that believe Palestinians should have a sovereign state and Israel needs to go further in compromising to create peace; and there is a spread of people in between with varied views. For example, Israeli elites wanted peace in the 1990s so as to build Israel's economy and integrate into the global economy that was opening up in the post‚ÄìCold War period.Barnett. M., 1999, \\"Culture, Society and Foreign Policy Change: Israel's Road to Oslo\\", European Journal of International Relations, Volume 5 (1), pp 5‚Äì36 The slowing down and deterioration of peace relations with Palestinians under Netanyahu's leadership frustrated many Israelis who view peace as a path to stability. Public opinions change, as Slater says, the notion of a withdrawal from the territories and Palestinians gaining their own state was unthinkable in most circles prior to the 1990s, however a decade later it was an accepted central theme of the peace process for many. The violence of the second intifada however has altered this opinion to a popular belief that this may no longer be a viable solution as military responses rather than negotiation has taken precedence. A poll conducted in 2010 by Israel Democracy Institute suggested that 15% of right-wing Jewish Israelis and 16% of left-wing Jewish Israelis support a binational state solution over a two states solution based on 1967 lines. According to the same poll, 66% of Jewish Israelis preferred the two-state solution.  Anti-peace terrorism  Fringe Israeli extremists have historically been opposed to the peace process. They fear that Israel would be forced to give too much land in the peace agreement, and show they opposition by using terrorism, which can be a real threat to any Israeli government pursuing peace. By example, in 1989-1990, the terrorist group Sicarii made arson and graffiti attacks, as well as death threats, against jewish leftist political figures who supported the peace process. More recently, on august 10, 2003, a jewish settler was arresting for threatening to kill Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Most violent opponents to the peace process were Kahanists, and have links to Meir Kahane's former Kach political party, which was outlawed as racist in 1988. Kahane, among other things, encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews.kahane.org ReferencesSee also *Israeli-Palestinian peace process *Palestinian views of the peace process *Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict *History of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict *Oslo Accords *Camp David 2000 summit *Road Map for Peace Category:Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process Category:Point of view ","title":"Israeli views on the peace process"},{"id":"10838413","text":"Meso region Vale do Itaja√≠ Vale do Itaja√≠ also known as Vale Europeu (or \\"European Valley\\") is a mesoregion located in the Northeastern part of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina.

He and Taddeo Gaddi were the most prominent Florentine pupils of Giotto di Bondone, exploring the three- dimensional dramatic realism inaugurated by Giotto.A World History of Art: Gothic Art. Maso's name and work are known to us from Lorenzo Ghiberti's autobiographical I Commentari, which identifies frescoes in the chapel of the Holy Confessors at Santa Croce, Florence as his chief work.Giorgio Vasari confused Maso with Maso di Stephano, called \\"Giottino\\". The frescoes, not signed or dated but probably c 1340, represent scenes from the Life of St. Sylvester (Pope Sylvester I), the Last Judgment, and The Entombment.

The teleplay by Richard Levinson and William Link was the first to deal sympathetically with homosexuality. Produced by Universal Television, it was broadcast as an ABC Movie of the Week on November 1, 1972, and received a number of television awards and nominations. A novelization of the film written by Burton Wohl was published by Bantam Books. Synopsis Divorced San Francisco contractor Doug Salter is looking forward to a summer visit from his fourteen-year-old son Nick, who lives in Los Angeles with his mother Janet. The boy does not know that his father is gay and committed to Gary McClain, his life partner of several years. Gary moves out temporarily in order to prevent Nick from suspecting the nature of their relationship. When Nick finds evidence of his father's secret life, the teen ‚Äî filled with shame and disgust ‚Äî runs away. Once reunited with his son, Doug attempts to explain his sexual orientation to him, with mixed results. Production notes Looking back on the ground-breaking broadcast, Hal Holbrook recalls \\"I was an actor clearly not afraid of controversy . . . Anything that would make the audience think was worthwhile,\\" although he turned down the role when it initially was offered to him. \\"I wasn't worried about whether the character was a gay person or not; the reason I turned it down, frankly, is I read the script and I didn't think much happened in it. I just thought it was kind of tame.\\" After he discussed the script with Carol Rossen, who was to become his second wife, she responded, \\"You're going to get on the phone and call Hollywood and tell them you want to do this part before they give it to somebody else,\\" and Holbrook did just that. He felt an emotional connection to the character in the film because at the time he had separated from his first wife and he hadn't told his two young children about the split. \\"It was very easy and natural for me to translate the emotional turmoil I personally was feeling into the turmoil [Doug] was feeling.\\" The film remains important to him because it meant so much to so many people. \\"That's a good reason for being an actor, when you can do something decent that touches people's hearts and their minds, so you feel like you actually accomplished something,\\" he says.Hal Holbrook interview at Gay.com In a 2007 interview with the Dallas Voice, Martin Sheen reminisced, \\"I thought it was wonderful. There was a great deal of freedom in it because it wasn't about advocating a lifestyle or a sexuality. It was about two people who adored each other, and they weren't allowed to have a relationship that involved their sexuality.\\" When asked if at the time he was concerned the role could affect his career, he responded, \\"I'd robbed banks and kidnapped children and raped women and murdered people, you know, in any number of shows. Now I was going to play a gay guy and that was like considered a career ender. Oh, for Christ‚Äôs sake! What kind of culture do we live in?\\"John Wright. \\"Legendary actor, liberal activist doesn‚Äôt hold back during sneak preview of Nov. 17 LGBT fundraiser\\" (archived), Dallas Voice, 25 October 2007.

It is also a Special Area of Conservation and is managed by the Kent Wildlife Trust, Topography rightPark Gate Down is located at (Ordnance Survey reference ) and covers seven hectares on the eastern slopes of a dry valley on the dip slope of the North Downs. The reserve is predominantly chalk grassland although the eastern fringes consist of a mixture of woodland and scrub which is partially situated on a layer of clay with flints that caps the chalk. In the south eastern corner of the reserve is a disused chalk pit and the western and northern area of the reserve borders on Elham Park Wood. To the south of the reserve is an area of land managed under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme which is being reverted from arable land to chalk downland. Ecology=Flora The dominant chalk grassland community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris). Monkey orchid at Park Gate Down.right Fourteen species of orchid are known to grow at the reserve including some of the UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007. Fauna The chalk downland provides an important habitat for insects. Many butterflies thrive at the reserve including the chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon), brown argus (Aricia agestis) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea). The woodland and scrub within and surrounding the reserve attract many feeding and breeding birds including the nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), whitethroat (Sylvia communis), garden warbler (Sylvia borin), hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes), sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and hobby (Falco subbuteo). Management and access The reserve is divided into three compartments by wire fences. The chalk grassland is maintained through annual grazing by Highland cattle and Konik ponies from September to December and scrub cutting in winter. This prevents tall and vigorous species from dominating, thus creating the species rich grassland characteristic of chalk downland. The woodland is regularly coppiced to provide a range of habitats for insects and birds. There is road side parking opposite the entrance on the south of the reserve. Although access is unrestricted, visitors must keep to the paths to avoid damage.

Biography=Early life William was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to Reuben and Hannah Loring. He was a fifth great grandson of New England pioneer Deacon Thomas Loring.Charles Henry Pope, \\"Loring Genealogy\\", 1917, p.228 When he was four, his family moved to Saint Augustine, Florida, where, at the young age of fourteen, he began a military career that spanned fifty years. As a fourteen-year-old, Loring joined the Florida Militia and gained his first combat experience fighting the Seminole Indians in minor skirmishes that would culminate in the Seminole Wars. When he was seventeen, he ran away to fight in the Texas War for Independence, but was soon retrieved by his father and taken home. For the next few years he would fight in the second Seminole War and end up being promoted to second lieutenant. In 1837, Loring was sent to Alexandria Boarding School in Alexandria, Virginia, completing his secondary education. He attended Georgetown University from 1839 to 1840 and then went on to study law, and was admitted to the Florida bar in 1842. In 1843, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives where he served from 1843 to 1845. In 1845 he ran unsuccessfully for the Florida Senate. Mexican-American War In 1846, Loring joined a newly formed regiment, the Regiment of Mounted Rifles, originally created to protect the Oregon Territory. He was promoted to major even before the regiment saw battle. Shortly thereafter the Mounted Rifles were sent to Mexico to fight in the Mexican-American war. Loring's regiment saw action in most of the battles of the war and he was wounded three times. While leading the charge into Mexico City, Loring's arm was shattered by a Mexican bullet, and he would later have it amputated. He received two brevets for bravery, one to lieutenant colonel, and another to colonel. Antebellum years In 1849, during the California gold rush, Loring was ordered to take command of the Oregon Territory and led a train of 600 mule teams 2,500 miles from Missouri to Oregon. He was in command of the Oregon Territory for two years and was then transferred to being commander of the forts of the frontier, such forts as Fort Ewell, Fort McIntosh, and Fort Union. During some five years he engaged in many skirmishes with the Indians, most notably with the Comanches, Apaches, and Kiowas. Loring was promoted to colonel at the age of 38 in December 1856, the youngest in the army. He left the United States and traveled to Europe in May 1859. While there, he, like many of his fellow American officers, studied the military tactics that had been invented in the recent Crimean War. Before he returned home, Loring would visit Great Britain, France, Sweden, Prussia, Switzerland, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Russia, Turkey, and Egypt. Civil War When the Civil War erupted, Loring sided with the South. In a conference in New Mexico, just before he left to defend his homeland, Loring told his officers, \\"The South is my home, and I am going to throw up my commission and shall join the Southern Army, and each of you can do as you think best.\\" He resigned from the U.S. Army on May 13, 1861. Upon offering his services to the Confederacy, Loring was promptly commissioned a brigadier general and given command of the Army of the Northwest, participating in the Western Virginia Campaign in the fall of 1861. His first assignment was to quickly collect and rally the shattered remnants of Robert S. Garnett's force following its defeat at the Battle of Rich Mountain, and drill them in preparation for the defense of western Virginia against Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's invasion from Ohio. After organizing an army of roughly 11,700 at Monterey, Virginia, Loring detached two brigades under Henry R. Jackson and William B. Taliaferro to the north, to fortify Frank Mountain, and defend the approach from Cheat Mountain. Loring moved the rest of his army, the brigades of S.R. Anderson, Daniel S. Donelson, and William Gilham, south to Huntersville. Four days after his arrival at Huntersville, Loring was joined by Colonel Robert E. Lee, who had been sent by Richmond to western Virginia with the diplomatic role of inspecting and consulting. Loring, a Mexican War veteran who outranked Lee at the time, saw Lee as Richmond's attempt to look over his shoulder, and grew resentful of his presence. Loring and Lee moved the southern portion of their army to Valley Mountain, near Mace, and down the Tygart Valley to the Battle of Cheat Mountain in September 1861. Loring soon acquired the nickname, \\"Old Blizzards\\" for his battle cry, \\"Give them blizzards, boys! Give them blizzards!\\" Following that debacle, they moved south into Greenbrier County to reenforce the troops of the Kanawha Division under former Virginia governors John B. Floyd and Henry Alexander Wise, then-at Sewell Mountain and Meadow Bluff. Lee was re-called back to Richmond in late October. Loring and the men remained for a short period before abandoning the mountainous region too, marching into, and down the Shenandoah Valley to join Stonewall Jackson at Winchester. Loring famously butted heads with superior officers, particularly with Stonewall Jackson. At the conclusion of the Romney Expedition in northwestern Virginia (now West Virginia) in January 1862, Jackson returned to his headquarters in Winchester while assigning Loring to stay and occupy the small, mountainous town. Unhappy with their assignment of holding a remote outpost in the dead of winter, Loring and his officers went over Jackson's head to Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin, requesting that the division be withdrawn. Jackson complied with the order, then resigned in protest of Richmond's interference with his command; he withdrew his resignation under pressure from Governor John Letcher and his former commander, Joseph E. Johnston, and Loring was reassigned out of Jackson's command, and given command of the Department of Southwestern Virginia.Virginia. Governor (1860-1863: Letcher). Executive Papers, 1859-1863. Accession 36787. State government records collection, The Library of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia. In his five months in that role, Loring moved a force of 5,000 into the Kanawha Valley, ultimately occupying Charleston for a six week period. In mid-October, Loring was transferred to the West. By November 1862, Loring was in Grenada, Mississippi, commanding a division in John C. Pemberton's Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, another superior officer he had friction with. In early spring of 1863, he defended against the Yazoo Pass Expedition, before his division was ordered south to re-enforce Vicksburg. He was present at Pemberton's disastrous defeat at Champion Hill. Cut off from the rest of the army, most of his division then marched east to Jackson, Mississippi to join forces with Gen. Joseph E. Johnston for the impending siege. By the end of 1863, he was under the command of Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk and defended east Mississippi from William T. Sherman during the Meridian Campaign of February 1864. Polk's relatively small force was then ordered to northwest Georgia to join Joe Johnston's Army of Tennessee, which was beginning to abandon its winter quarters in Dalton, Georgia to start the Atlanta Campaign. Polk's divisions, one commanded by Loring, arrived just in time to temporarily thwart a flanking maneuver by Union General James B. McPherson at the Battle of Resaca. Facing overwhelming numbers, Johnston's army was continuously flanked and forced to withdraw closer and closer to Atlanta. Loring temporarily took command of Polk's III corps when Polk was nearly cut in two by an artillery round and killed at Pine Mountain on June 14, 1864. He led the corps during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain but was soon replaced on July 7, 1864 by Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart. Loring returned to divisional command, fighting at the Battle of Peachtree Creek, and at Ezra Church, where he was wounded. Loring was out of action until after the fall of Atlanta. Upon returning he commanded his division in Stewart's corps of army now commanded by John Bell Hood, seeing combat at the Franklin on November 30, 1864, and Nashville in mid-December. In the last year of the war, the remnants of Hood's smashed forces returned east to participate in the Carolinas Campaign, seeing action at the Battle of Bentonville before being surrendered by Johnston at Durham, North Carolina a month later. Egypt Loring Pasha as a general in the Khedivate of Egypt After the Confederate defeat in the Civil War, Loring served for nine years in the army of Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt. He joined about fifty Union and Confederate veterans who had been recommended to the Khedive by William Tecumseh Sherman. Loring began as Inspector General of the army, a position in which he suggested various ways to modernize the army. He was then placed in charge of the country‚Äôs coastal defenses, where he oversaw the erection of numerous fortifications. In 1875, he was promised the command of an Egyptian invasion of Abyssinia, however Ratib Pasha was given the assignment instead, and Loring was named chief of staff. Ratib Pasha was the ex-slave of the late Said Pawshar, the viceroy of Egypt, with negligible military qualifications; according to one of Loring's American compatriots, the freedman was \\"shrivelled with lechery as the mummy is with age.\\"Czeslaw Jesman, \\"Egyptian Invasion of Ethiopia\\", African Affairs, 58 (1959), p. 79 The Egyptian-Ethiopian War ended in disaster at the Battle of Gura, and the Egyptians blamed the Americans for the disaster. When Ratib Pasha had urged remaining with the Gura fortress, Loring had taunted him and called him a coward until he consented to meeting the Ethiopian host in the open valley.Boulger, Demetrius. The Life of Gordon, pp. 230 ff. T. Fisher Unwin (London), 1896 reprinted Library of Alexandria, 1986. While the rest of the Egyptian army returned home, they were ordered to remain in Massawa until further notice, where they endured the summer months, then spent the next two years enduring endless frustration and humiliation in Cairo.Jesman, \\"Egyptian Invasion\\", p. 81 In 1878, partially due to finances, the American officers were dismissed. During his service to Egypt, Loring attained the rank of Fereek Pasha (Major General). After his return to the United States, he wrote a book about his Egyptian experiences, entitled A Confederate Soldier in Egypt (1884). Loring was also the posthumous co-author of The March of the Mounted Riflemen (1940).Eicher, pp. 353-54. Return to United States Loring returned to Florida where he unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate against Charles W. Jones. He then moved to New York City, where he died. He was buried in Loring Park, behind Government House in downtown St. Augustine, Florida until August 24, 2020, when the University of Florida Historic St. Augustine exhumed his ashes and began the process of moving them to Craig Funeral Home Memorial Park. https://www.staugustine.com/story/news/2020/08/24/crews-moved-monument- confederate-gen-william-loring-monday/3429651001/ Legacy and honors * During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor. * A memorial to him in St. Augustine, Florida, was removed in August 2020 at the request of his descendents.

It is a Local Nature Reserve, a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade 2, and a Special Area of Conservation.. It is in the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is managed by the Kent Wildlife Trust, and part of it is owned by Plantlife. History The reserve covers almost and comprises several distinct sections. The original reserve, which was a rabbit warren in the Middle Ages, forms the current reserve's core. It has probably been open downland for many hundreds of years and has an internationally important community of grassland orchids. A major extension to the reserve was made in 1999 with the addition of pasture on the opposite side of the valley facing the Main Bank. This is being managed to encourage colonisation of species from the original reserve. In 2003 hectares of arable land opposite the Main Bank were added, doubling the size of the reserve. Over time this will be restored to prime wildlife-friendly land. Flora Queendown has the usual plants of chalk grassland, and orchids are well represented, particularly the fragrant orchid, with scattered groups of early spider, bee and man orchids. Later in the year autumn lady's-tresses may be found. A good variety of chalk grassland butterflies can be seen in summer, including the Adonis Blue, re-introduced in 2002. At the bottom of the bank, there is a colony of rabbits which, together with grazing cattle, help to maintain the short sward, essential for the maintenance of many orchid populations. The West Bank has several patches of fly orchid and white helleborine in the scrub and woodland edges. Some particularly good examples of the many large beech trees on the reserve can be seen in this section. Potters Wood contains native broad leaved trees - oak, ash, beech, birch and wild cherry - and some sweet chestnut coppice managed by traditional methods. The southern part of the wood is on the chalk and has the remnants of many large beech trees which fell during the storm of October 1987. This area is especially good for observing adders.

The Baltimore Public Works Museum was located at 751 Eastern Avenue, Pier 7 of the Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland. This museum provided a behind-the-scenes glimpse of how a large city provides public works utility services to its citizens. Exhibits also explained street lighting, road maintenance, and trash removal. An outdoor sculpture called Streetscape was an intricate model of a network of phone lines, street lights, storm drains and pipes for water, gas, and sewage disposal. The building housing this display is an operating sewage pumping station built in 1912. The museum opened in 1982 and was operated under the auspices of the Baltimore Department of Public Works. On February 3, 2010, the city announced that the museum would close immediately due to budget constraints. Since then, various efforts have been made to re-open the Baltimore Public Works Museum. Attendees of the centennial celebration event of the city's Montebello Water Filtration Plant in 2015 were given blue bags by the Baltimore City Department of Public Works that had printed on them www.PublicWorksMuseum.org, a website associated with a group called \\"Friends of the Public Works Museum\\" whose goal \\"is to reopen the Public Works Museum\\", though by 2017 that did not lead to a valid website.Wayback Machine archive search: last valid snapshot is 2016-10-11, with a redirect to different organization name held by a domain squatter as of 2017-06-23.

It occurred on 18 and 19 November 1432, near Delebio, in the Valtellina. It was an aftermath of the occupation of Brescia and the Valle Camonica by the armies of the Republic of Venice, led by Francesco Bussone, Count of Carmagnola. Prelude The Venetian troops under Giorgio Corner had invaded the Valtellina in 1431, in order to secure the Republic's northern borders and favour their trade towards Germany. On 18 November 1432 the army of Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan, with more than 400 horse and an unspecified infantry under the condottiero Niccol√≤ Piccinino, marched alongside the Lake Como to defy the Venetians. Among the commanders of the Venetian troops was Bartolomeo Colleoni, which later became one of the most famous condottiero. Battle The first clash occurred that same day, when Venetians lost c. 300 infantry to push back a surprise attack on their camp. The following morning the camp was attacked by Piccinino from the West and by the Ghibellines of Valtellina, under Stefano Quadrio, from the East. The Venetians were crushed, most of their commanders being imprisoned. The Venetian losses amounted to 1,800 cavalry and 3,500 infantry, with c. 2,700 prisoners (5,000 casualties and 7,000 prisoners according to other sources).

The high school serves the populations of Aromas, Castroville, Prunedale, Royal Oaks, Elkhorn, and Salinas. North Monterey County High School is part of the North Monterey County Unified School District. North Monterey County High School is abbreviated on some official documents as NMCHS although it is more commonly known as either \\"North County\\" or \\"NC\\". Students North County serves just under 1500 students. 56% of the students are Hispanic or Latino, 36% are White, 2% are African American, and 3% are Asian . About one-fifth of North County students are designated as English Language Learners. Background Before 1978, North Monterey County students traveled to Salinas for high school. Many local residents wanted to have their own high school so their children would not have to travel to Salinas for high school. In 1978, voters approved a bond measure to build the high school under the campaign slogan \\"Yes is Best\\". In the fall of 1978, North County opened its doors to a new student body that did not include a senior class. In June, 1980, the first class graduated from North County. In 1985, the high school won national recognition by President Reagan as one of the best 100 high schools in the country and subsequently won two distinguished California High School Awards in the 1990s. The school was recently recognized at the California Conference of Superintendents for its high Latino graduation rate. Governance North Monterey County High School's budget is determined by the Board of Trustees of the North Monterey County Unified School District. Internally, the administration of the school is led by Coordinators Jim Oneil, Laurel Gast, and Richard Gutierrez. There is an Activities Director that oversees school activities and an Athletic Director who manages school athletics. Some funding for the school is controlled by the School Site Council or SIP (School Site Improvement Project). The SIP committee is coordinated by the SIP Coordinator who is a salaried school official. The current SIP Coordinator is Ms. Laurel Gast. SIP committee members include parents, staff, the Principal, and students. The committee members elect a member to serve as their president. Academics, Courses, Graduation Requirements North County offers a selection of courses to its students. North County has ROP, art, photography, and tech courses. NC has an honors and AP program that includes several AP courses. The first AP course offered at North County was AP US History, currently taught by Mr. Robert Agan. The first AP US History class was taught by Bill O'Leary. NC's API test scores place North County as average in California, but NC's API scores in the context of similar schools ranks NC as above average . Activities=Marching Band The NMCHS marching band, directed by D. L. Johnson, has received attention for performances in China, Italy, Hawaii, and participation in President Clinton's second inaugural parade.

Shopping.com started out with the name DealTime.com which still operates as a related, but otherwise separate website. History Shopping.com began as Papricom (DealTime.com), which was founded in Israel in 1998 by Dr. Nahum Sharfman and Amir Ashkenazi, the original business model was to create a downloadable client that would monitor changes in prices of products the user seeks to buy over time, notifying the user when the product price reached a predetermined level (hence the site's original name, DealTime). Originally targeting American consumers, the basic concept was quickly modified from a downloadable client to a purely web-based service, a concept the company has kept ever since. After recruiting a management team of high-ranking executives from other industries, DealTime underwent rapid expansion in 2000 including formation of a major alliance with media giant Bertelsmann, adding British, German, Spanish and Japanese versions of its original American-targeted website, and acquiring Digital Jones, a product advisory website. However, during 2000 and 2001 it became apparent that the operation was losing a significant amount of money and that massive changes were needed. Three rounds of layoffs done in 2001 and 2002 halved the workforce to some 150; the Japanese and German websites were scrapped in late 2001, as well as plans for an early IPO, and Digital Jones was shelved. Also, a growing percentage of the merchants being advertised on DealTime's website were forced to start paying for this service or become de-listed; some lucrative product categories became paying-merchants-only. In 2002, a new bidding system was introduced, in which the highest-bidding merchant got higher placement on the default price comparison results page (consumers could always sort by price or rating). All these changes enabled the company to become profitable for the first time in 2003. Under the leadership of its CEO, Daniel T. Ciporin, in April 2003, DealTime acquired the California-based consumer product review site Epinions.com. In September 2003, the merged sites relaunched under the Shopping.com brand and web address which it had purchased from Alta Vista. The new name, as well as some offline (TV) advertisement and large online advertisement with partners such as Google and other portals, enabled Shopping.com to become the 3rd most-visited consumer website, following eBay and Amazon, for several months during 2004, and continuously in the top-10. Although Shopping.com remained an Israeli corporation with R&D; facilities in Netanya, Israel, it had a strong US presence with its corporate headquarters first in New York City (1998‚Äì2003) and later in Brisbane, California. The company went finally public in October 2004, and was acquired by eBay in June 2005 for $21 per share in cash, or total consideration of approximately $634 million. It is currently a semi-autonomous division within eBay and still runs the www.shopping.com website. eBay and Shopping.com functionalities are slowly being merged, for example eBay's PayPal payment system in SDC's offering to its advertising merchants. Shopping.com accepts CPC bidding. Merchants must pay a minimum of $100. Since 2005, the company has added French, Australian and once again a German version of its website.

The armed forces of Czechoslovakia ceased to exist on 31 December 1992. By the end of the year, all aircraft of the Czechoslovak Air Force were divided between the Czech Air Force and the Slovak Air Force. Organization On 30 October 1918, the establishment of Aviation Corps (Leteck√Ω sbor) marked the beginning of the Czechoslovak Air Force. Under the First Republic, the air force was an integral service of the Czechoslovak army. During peacetime, the army aviation was a subordinate agency of the Ministry of National Defence within its 3rd Department of Aviation (III. odbor (leteck√Ω) Ministerstva n√°rodn√≠ obrany) under the command of divisional general Jaroslav Fajfr (as of October 1938). It was anticipated that individual squadrons and flights would be attached to various field corps and divisions in case of war with Germany. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945, the air force was once again organized as an integral part of the army within following ministerial departments: * 1945‚Äì1950: Air Force Command of the Main Staff (Velitelstv√≠ letectva hlavn√≠ho ≈°t√°bu) * 1950‚Äì1957: Air Force Command (Velitelstv√≠ letectva) In mid-1950s, following the example of Soviet Air Defence Forces, the State Air Defence (Protivzdu≈°n√° obrana st√°tu, PVOS) was formed alongside the Air Force. * 1957‚Äì1966: Air Force and State Air Defence Command (Velitelstv√≠ letectva a protivzdu≈°n√© obrany st√°tu) * 1966‚Äì1969: Main Department of Air Force and State Air Defence (Hlavn√≠ spr√°va letectva a vojsk protivzdu≈°n√© obrany st√°tu) * 1969‚Äì1976: Department of Air Force and State Air Defence (Spr√°va letectva a vojsk protivzdu≈°n√© obrany st√°tu) In 1976, the State Air Defence formed its own command (1976‚Äì1990). * 1976‚Äì1990: Air Force Command (Velitelstv√≠ letectva) ‚Äì see also Air Forces Command structure in 1989 In May 1990, the State Air Defence (PVOS), Air Defence of Ground Forces and Frontline Aviation were merged to form an integrated branch of the armed forces ‚Äì the Czechoslovak Air Force and Air Defence. * 1990‚Äì1991: Air Force and State Air Defence Command (Velitelstv√≠ letectva a protivzdu≈°n√© obrany st√°tu) * 1991‚Äì1992: Air Force and Air Defence Command (Velitelstv√≠ letectva a protivzdu≈°n√© obrany) History=Under the First Republic 1918‚Äì38 When the First Czechoslovak Republic was founded in October 1918 it was landlocked and surrounded by potentially hostile neighbours. Its government realised the need for an air force, and quickly founded one with the motto \\"Our sea is in the air\\". From Austria-Hungary the new republic inherited only three military airfields and a handful of Hansa- Brandenburg aircraft. In the First World War few Czechs or Slovaks had served in the Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops or naval air corps, or in exile in the French Air Force or Imperial Russian Air Service. Aero A.30 light bomber and reconnaissance biplane But Czechoslovakia inherited much of Austria- Hungary's manufacturing industry, and quickly developed an aircraft industry. At first it tended to build foreign designs of aircraft and aero engines under license. As the industry developed it designed more aircraft and engines of its own. Czechoslovak aircraft builders included Aero, Avia, Bene≈°-Mr√°z, Letov, Praga, Tatra and Zlin. Engine makers included ƒåKD, Walter and ≈†koda. Aero (Aero tov√°rna letadel) was in the Vysoƒçany quarter of Prague. Its mixed construction (wood, metal, and fabric covering) and all-metal aircraft were competitive in the early 1930s, but by 1938, only its MB.200 (a licensed Bloch design) was not totally obsolete. Avia B-534 fighter Avia (Avia akciov√° spoleƒçnost pro pr≈Ømysl leteck√Ω ≈†koda), a branch of the enormous ≈†koda Works (≈†kodovy z√°vody) heavy machinery and military industrial enterprise, was different. Founded in 1919 in a former sugar refinery in the eastern Prague suburbs of Let≈àany and ƒåakovice, Avia made entire aeroplanes. Many of its engines were licensed Hispano-Suiza designs. It build the standard Czechoslovak fighter aircraft of the late 1930s, the B-534, of which a total 568 were built. The B-534 and its derivatives were among the last biplane fighters in operational use. ≈†-28 The state-controlled Letov factory (Vojensk√° tov√°rna na letadla Letov) was also in Let≈àany, where in the late 1930s it employed about 1,200 people. It built the ≈†-28 reconnaissance and army co-operation biplane, of which more than 470 were made. The entire airframe was welded together, not bolted or riveted. The Letov factory was the only Czechoslovak plant that made metal propellers. Tupolev SB medium bomber By the late 1930s Czechoslovakia's bomber aircraft were obsolescent and the speed with which Nazi Germany was becoming a threat did not give Czechoslovak manufacturers enough time to develop a new bomber of their own. So in 1937 the government bought Tupolev SB twin-engined medium bombers from the Soviet Union, plus a license to build more in Czechoslovakia as the Avia B-71. 60 Soviet-built SB bombers were delivered in April and May 1938. This was followed by Avia and Aero building 101 of the B-71 version. The training of air force recruits had developed from a course of several months in the 1920s to two years by the late 1930s. In 1936 Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring wrote \\"The Czechoslovak Air Force must be considered as one of the leading air forces as regards personnel, and, considering its limited financial possibilities, more than satisfactory with regard to material and equipment\\". Crisis and occupation 1938‚Äì39 As the Sudeten crisis with Germany worsened, the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force partly mobilised on 21 May 1938 and fully mobilised on 23 September. The air force had more than 100 airfields and 1,300 aeroplanes, of which 650 were front-line aircraft. But on 29 September the United Kingdom and France agreed to let Germany annex the Sudetenland, which German forces then did without Czechoslovak armed forces being allowed to resist. The Munich Agreement was followed on 2 November 1938 by the First Vienna Award, in which Germany and Fascist Italy allowed Hungary to annex southern Slovakia. Then on 15 March 1939 Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, created the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia rump state and allowed what remained of Slovakia to become the Slovak Republic. Germany allowed Slovakia to keep a small army and air force, but it ordered the puppet government of Bohemia and Moravia to dissolve its armed forces. The Luftwaffe confiscated all Czechoslovak Air Force aircraft. All Czechoslovak aircraft factories were converted to produce German aircraft and engines. The Luftwaffe tried to recruit demobilised Czechoslovak airmen to non-combat roles such as ferry flights and meteorological flights, but without success. It also confiscated Czechoslovak aircraft and tried to get Czechoslovak airmen to fly them to Germany. But of seven Czechoslovak pilots who took off from Hradec Kr√°lov√© airfield in Moravia, none reached Germany. Three flew to Poland, two reached the USSR and the other two crash-landed their aircraft, without injuring themselves but rendering their aircraft beyond economic repair. Thereafter Germany gave up trying to use Czechoslovak airmen. Emigration was strictly controlled and former air force personnel were not allowed to leave the country. But many Czechoslovak airmen got themselves smuggled into Poland. Of these a few joined the Polish Air Force but most continued to France. Second World War 1939‚Äì45 Fighter ace Josef Franti≈°ek served in the Czechoslovak, Polish, French and UK air forces Czechoslovak pilots who joined the Polish Air Force went into action in September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. Many fought with distinction and 55 were decorated. Josef Franti≈°ek was among those awarded Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari. After the USSR joined the invasion of Poland its forces captures some Czechoslovak airmen. Others escaped as Poland fell, first reaching Romania and then going via the Balkans and Syria or Lebanon to join their compatriots who had already reached France. At first France insisted that all Czechoslovak airmen join the Foreign Legion. Only after France had declared war on Germany did it agree with the Czechoslovak National Committee in Paris to let the men transfer to the French Air Force and restore their ranks. They needed to be re-trained to fly French aircraft, but some completed their training in time to fight in the Battle of France in May and June 1940. Of these, seven were awarded France's highest military decoration, the L√©gion d'honneur, and five received the M√©daille militaire. 70 Czechoslovak airmen, including Josef Franti≈°ek and Karel Kuttelwascher, were awarded the Croix de Guerre. =RAF Volunteer Reserve 1940‚Äì45= 310 Squadron at RAF Duxford in front of a Hawker Hurricane Mk I, September 1940 After France capitulated to Germany on 22 June 1940, many Czechoslovak airmen escaped via either France's Atlantic or Mediterranean coasts or from French North Africa. They reached the United Kingdom, where Brigadier General Karel Janou≈°ek quickly secured an agreement with the UK War Department for them to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR). On 12 July 1940 an Inspectorate of the Czechoslovak Air Force was established, with Janou≈°ek as Inspector-General with the RAF rank of Air Commodore. A Czechoslovak dep√¥t was created at RAF Cosford in Shropshire. The RAF quickly created new squadrons formed of Czechoslovak pilots. The first fighter unit was No. 310 Squadron RAF, which was formed on 10 July 1940 and immediately joined in the Battle of Britain. By the end of July a bomber unit, No. 311 Squadron RAF, had been added. Further Czechoslovak fighter units followed: 312 Squadron by August 1940 and 313 Squadron in May 1941. Czechoslovaks quickly adapted to the structure, tactics and aircraft types of the RAF. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, who led RAF Fighter Command in the Battle of Britain, later recalled: Vickers Wellington 1C aircraft of 311 Squadron in flight, March 1941 > I must confess that I had been a little doubtful of the effect which their > experience in their own countries and in France might have had upon the > Polish and Czech pilots, but my doubts were soon laid to rest, because all > three squadrons swung in the fight with a dash and enthusiasm which is > beyond praise. They were inspired by a burning hatred for the Germans which > made them very deadly opponents. From 1940 until 1942, 311 Squadron was part of No. 3 Group, Bomber Command. The Group commander said 311 \\"put up a wonderful show\\" and had \\"the finest navigators in Bomber Command\\". Seven pilots of 312 Squadron at RAF Harrowbeer in Devon, just after President Edvard Bene≈° has decorated them. Five wear the Czechoslovak War Cross 1939‚Äì1945 and four wear what appears to be the ƒåeskoslovensk√° medaile Za chrabrost p≈ôed nep≈ô√≠telem (\\"Czechoslovak Medal for valor in face of the Enemy\\"). A preponderance of air force personnel who escaped from occupied Czechoslovakia were aircrew. The RAF had a shortage of Czechoslovak ground crew, so the new squadrons continued to rely in part on ground crew from the UK and other nationalities. And numerous Czechoslovak airmen were posted to more than 60 other RAF units, including 11 front-line squadrons. Enough Czechoslovaks were posted to No. 68 Squadron to form an entire flight. 68 squadron even adopted a Czech motto, V≈ædy p≈ôipraven (\\"Always ready\\"). Czech fighter ace Josef Franti≈°ek, acclaimed by one wartime author as \\"the greatest of all Czechoslovak pilots, perhaps one of the greatest fighters of all time\\", served in the Battle of Britain in No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. Karel Kuttelwascher, a night fighter ace nicknamed the \\"Night Reaper\\", served in No. 1 Squadron. =Soviet Air Force= Other Czech and Slovak pilots fought against Germany under Soviet command. =Slovak Republic Air Force 1938‚Äì45= After the German partition of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Slovakia was left with a small air force (Slovensk√© vzdu≈°n√© zbrane or SVZ) equipped primarily with Czechoslovak aircraft. In 1939 the SVZ defended Slovakia against Hungary in the Slovak‚ÄìHungarian War, and fought alongside German forces in the Slovak invasion of Poland. In the German invasion of Russia the SVZ provided air cover for Slovak forces fighting against the USSR on the Eastern Front. During the campaign Slovakia's obsolete biplanes were replaced with German combat aircraft, including the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The air force was sent back to Slovakia after combat fatigue and desertion had reduced the pilots' effectiveness. Slovak air units took part in the Slovak National Uprising against Germany from late August 1944. Under the Third Republic 1945‚Äì48 Farewell parade of Czechoslovak squadrons at RAF Manston, Kent, on 3 August 1945. Air Marshal John Slessor, with walking stick, inspects some of the men. Air Marshal Janou≈°ek can be seen behind him. Towards the end of the Second World War, General left Britain for the Soviet Union, where he was supposed to take over command of the Czechoslovak Air Force in the USSR. However, he only arrived on 1 May 1945, when the war was almost over. Vicherek was happy to serve an Eastern Bloc Czechoslovakia, and on 29 May 1945 he was appointed the Commander of the Czechoslovak Air Force. In August 1945 the RAF's four Czechoslovak squadrons, numbers 310, 311, 312, and 313, all relocated to Czechoslovakia and became part of the Czechoslovak armed forces. By then 310, 312 and 313 squadrons were equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX aircraft and 311 Squadron was equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. The Spitfires were flown to Czechoslovakia with long range \\"slipper\\" fuel tanks to give them enough range for the journey. On 15 January 1946 311 Squadron became the Czechoslovak 6 leteck√° divize (\\"6th Air Division\\") at Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod in southeastern Bohemia. In May it was divided into Leteck√Ω pluk 24 and Leteck√Ω pluk 25 (\\"24th and 25th Air Regiments\\"). Leteck√Ω pluk 24 was given the name Biskajsky (\\"Biscay\\") and initially equipped with Mosquito FB Mk VI fighter-bombers. Leteck√Ω pluk 25 was given the name Atlanticky (\\"Atlantic\\") and equipped with Petlyakov Pe-2FT aircraft. Avia S-99 training aircraft Under German occupation, Aero and Avia had built Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters for the Luftwaffe. In order to expand Czechoslovakia's fighter complement beyond the three squadrons of Spitfires transferred from the UK, Avia continued building the Bf 109 as the Avia S-99. However, an industrial accident soon destroyed Avia's remaining stock of Daimler-Benz DB 605 aircraft engines, so Avia substituted the Junkers Jumo 211 engine and associated propeller. The resulting hybrid aircraft was called the Avia S-199. The Jumo engine and propeller had been made for medium bombers and had the wrong performance characteristics for a fighter aircraft. This gave the S-199 poor handling, particularly during take-off and landing. Production ended in 1949 and Czechoslovakia withdrew its last S-199 aircraft from service in 1957. Lavochkin La-7 of the 2nd flight, 1st fighter air regiment, 4th air division in 1947 From 1945 the Air Force also had 56 Soviet-built Lavochkin La-7 fighters, which were quicker and man≈ìuvred better than the Bf 109 and S-199. Under Communism 1948‚Äì89 The Spitfires were Czechoslovakia's primary fighter aircraft until the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat, after which the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia purged air force personnel who had served in the RAF. Many ex-RAF personnel, including Air Marshal Janou≈°ek and Hawker Hurricane pilot Josef Bryks, were tried on false charges and given long prison sentences. In 1955 Czechoslovakia became a founder member of the Warsaw Pact. The Czechoslovak Air Force was equipped with Soviet aircraft and followed its doctrines and tactics. Mostly Mikoyan-Gurevich aircraft (MiGs) were bought. MiG-15, MiG-19, and MiG-21F fighters were produced under licence; in the 1970s, MiG-23MF were acquired, followed by MiG‚àí23MLs and MiG-29s in the 1980s. In 1951 the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Air Defence Districts of State Territory were created, at about the same time as the creation of the 15th Fighter Air Corps. The 15th Fighter Air Corps controlled the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 166th Fighter Air Divisions at various times; the 166th Fighter Air Division later became the 2nd Fighter Air Division. From 1964 to 1969 the 10th Air Army included the 46th Transport Air Division, of two regiments of helicopters and a transport regiment. Czechoslovak MiG-21R 'Fishbed' Reportedly from January 1976, the 7th Air Army was disbanded and replaced by the State Air Defence Command with the 2nd and 3rd Air Defence Divisions, which existed until 1990.http://forum.valka.cz . Note that Air International, July 1991, p.12, said that the 7th Air Army 'was disbanded some two years ago.' The State Air Defence Command moved from Prague to Star√° Boleslav in 1981. In May 1987 two Czechoslovak Air Force jets were scrambled to try to bring down a Czechoslovak engineer attempting to escape his home country via a home-built ultralight aircraft. After flying about to the West German border, the refugee's aircraft ran out of fuel, and he landed safely in a Bavarian forest, just before the Czechoslovak fighters could intercept him. In the 1980s and early 1990s the Czechoslovak Air Force consisted of the state air defence command, with air defence fighters, surface to air missiles, and air defence radars, and the 10th Air Army, responsible for ground forces support. The state air defence command had 2nd Air Defence Division (Brno) with 8th Fighter Air Regiment, radars, and surface to air missiles, and the 3rd Air Defence Division (≈Ωatec) with the 1st (ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice), 5th (Dob≈ôany), and 11th Fighter Air Regiments (Zatec), and the 71st Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade and 185th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment. 8th Fighter Air Regiment was based at (Ostrava) (Mo≈°nov) from 1959 until 1 April 1985, whereupon it relocated to Brno (Tu≈ôany). It was equipped with the MiG-21 from 1965 to 1991. 1st Fighter Air Regiment at ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice was equipped with MiG-21s from 1964, and was disbanded in 1992. Czechoslovak MiG-23BN at Prague Aviation Museum The 10th Air Army had two air divisions and a total of six regiments of fighters and attack aircraft.; see also Air International, July 1991, p.12. There were also two reconnaissance regiments, two transport regiments, three training regiments, and two helicopter regiments. In 1990 the 10th Air Army, with headquarters at Hradec Kr√°lov√©, comprised the 1st Fighter Air Division (HQ Bechynƒõ, included the 9th Fighter Air Regiment at the same base until 30 June 1990), the 34th Fighter Bomber Air Division (HQ ƒå√°slav, which Air International in July 1991 reported as comprising the 6th & 20th (Su-22), and 28 (MiG-23BN) FB Regiments, plus the 9th Air Defence Regiment with MiG-21bis), the 47th Reconnaissance Air Regiment (Ostrava-Mo≈°nov), the 10th Signal Regiment, the 11th Helicopter Regiment, the 1st Composite Transport Air Regiment, and the 30th Attack Air Regiment (Pardubice Airport, with Su-25Ks). It was disbanded on 1 October 1990 and succeeded by the 1st Mixed Air Corps. Between 1945 and 1968 the Czechoslovak Air Force operated several regiments from Hradƒçany airfield: * 46 Bomber Division (46. leteck√° bombardovac√≠ divize) between 1951 and 1955. * 24 Bomber Regiment (24. leteck√Ω bombardovac√≠ pluk) between 1952 and 1954. * 25 Bomber Regiment (25. leteck√Ω bombardovac√≠ pluk) between 1952 and 1954. * 17 Fighter Regiment (17. st√≠hac√≠ leteck√Ω pluk) between 1955 and 1964. * 26 Fighter Regiment (26. st√≠hac√≠ leteck√Ω pluk) between 1956 and 1958. * 30 Fighter-Bomber Regiment (30. st√≠hac√≠ bombardovac√≠ leteck√Ω pluk) between 1958 and 1959. * 2 Fighter-Bomber Regiment (2. st√≠hac√≠ bombardovac√≠ leteck√Ω pluk) between 1964 and 1968. After Communism 1990‚Äì92 In November and December 1989 the Velvet Revolution ended Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. In 1992 the Slovak Republic voted to leave the federal republic, which was dissolved on 1 January 1993. The assets of the former air force were divided 2:1 in the Czech favor, and thus the Czech Air Force and the Slovak Air Force were formed. The 18 MiG-29s then in service were divided 1:1 between the new countries. A 1992‚Äì93 reorganisation resulted in a completely new structure of the Czech Air Force which came into effect in 1994., accessed March 2012 One of the first units which closed down as a direct result of the transfer of a large number of aircraft to Slovakia was the 9th Fighter Bomber Air Regiment (9. SBoLP) at Bechynƒõ.

The divergence between actual and estimated costs in large industrial and infrastructure projects: is nuclear special? In: Nuclear new build: insights into financing and project management. Nuclear Energy Agency, pp. 177‚Äì188. New nuclear power plants typically have high capital expenditure for building the plant. Fuel, operational, and maintenance costs are relatively small components of the total cost. The long service life and high capacity factor of nuclear power plants allow sufficient funds for ultimate plant decommissioning and waste storage and management to be accumulated, with little impact on the price per unit of electricity generated. Other groups disagree with these statements. Additionally, measures to mitigate climate change such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, would favor the economics of nuclear power over fossil fuel power. Other groups argue that nuclear power is not the answer to climate change. Nuclear power construction costs have varied significantly across the world and in time. Large and rapid increases in cost occurred during the 1970s, especially in the United States. There were no construction starts of nuclear power reactors between 1979 and 2012 in the United States, and since then more new reactor projects have gone into bankruptcy than have been completed. Recent cost trends in countries such as Japan and Korea have been very different, including periods of stability and decline in costs. In more economically developed countries, a slowdown in electricity demand growth in recent years has made large-scale power infrastructure investments difficult. Very large upfront costs and long project cycles carry large risks, including political decision making and intervention such as regulatory ratcheting. In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find financing, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for clean energy projects. Former Exelon CEO John Rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States \\"don't make any sense right now\\" and would not be economic as long as gas prices remain low.Jeff McMahon, \\"Exelon's nuclear guy: no new nukes\\", Forbes 29 Mar. 2012 Current bids for new nuclear power plants in China were estimated at between $2500/kW and $3500/kW, as China planned to accelerate its new build program after a pause following the Fukushima disaster. However, more recent reports indicated that China will fall short of its targets. While nuclear power in China has been cheaper than solar and wind power, these are getting cheaper while nuclear power costs are growing. Moreover, the costs of third generation plants are expected to be considerably more expensive than earlier plants. Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants. Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with political change and regulatory ratcheting were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and the risk of cheap competition from subsidised energy sources emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the risk of investing in new nuclear power plants. Two of the four EPRs under construction (the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in Finland and Flamanville in France), which are the latest new builds in Europe, are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost. Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for some types of currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to new requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.  Overview  Olkiluoto 3 under construction in 2009. It is the first EPR design, but problems with workmanship and supervision have created costly delays which led to an inquiry by the Finnish nuclear regulator STUK. In December 2012, Areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor will be about ‚Ç¨8.5 billion, or almost three times the original delivery price of ‚Ç¨3 billion. Although the price of new plants in China is lower than in the Western world John Quiggin, an economics professor, maintains that the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically viable. Professor of science and technology Ian Lowe has also challenged the economics of nuclear power. However, nuclear supporters continue to point to the historical success of nuclear power across the world, and they call for new reactors in their own countries, including proposed new but largely uncommercialised designs, as a source of new power.Jonathan Leake. The Nuclear Charm Offensive\\" New Statesman, 23 May 2005.Union of Concerned Scientists.

Nuclear supporters point out that the IPCC climate panel endorses nuclear technology as a low carbon, mature energy source which should be nearly quadrupled to help address soaring greenhouse gas emissions.https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment- report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf Some independent reviews keep repeating that nuclear power plants are necessarily very expensive, and anti-nuclear groups frequently produce reports that say the costs of nuclear energy are prohibitively high. In 2012 in Ontario, Canada, costs for nuclear generation stood at 5.9¬¢/kWh while hydroelectricity, at 4.3¬¢/kWh, cost 1.6¬¢ less than nuclear. By September 2015, the cost of solar in the United States dropped below nuclear generation costs, averaging 5¬¢/kWh. Solar costs continued to fall, and by February 2016, the City of Palo Alto, California, approved a power-purchase agreement (PPA) to purchase solar electricity for under 3.68¬¢/kWh, lower than even hydroelectricity. Utility- scale solar electricity generation newly contracted by Palo Alto in 2016 costs 2.22¬¢/kWh less than electricity from the already-completed Canadian nuclear plants, and the costs of solar energy generation continue to drop. However, solar power has very low capacity factors compared to nuclear, and solar power can only achieve so much market penetration before (expensive) energy storage and transmission become necessary. Countries including Russia, India, and China, have continued to pursue new builds. Globally, around 50 nuclear power plants were under construction in 20 countries as of April 2020, according to the IAEA. China has 10 reactors under construction. According to the World Nuclear Association, the global trend is for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired.World Nuclear Association, \\"Plans for New Reactors Worldwide\\", October 2015. In the United States, nuclear power faces competition from the low natural gas prices in North America. Former Exelon CEO John Rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States \\"don‚Äôt make any sense right now\\" and won't be economic as long as the natural gas glut persists. In 2016, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo directed the New York Public Service Commission to consider ratepayer-financed subsidies similar to those for renewable sources to keep nuclear power stations profitable in the competition against natural gas. A 2019 study by the economic think tank DIW found that nuclear power has not been profitable anywhere in the World.DIW Weekly Report 30 / 2019, S. 235-243 Research: not one single nuclear power plant in the world was ever profitable The study of the economics of nuclear power has found it has never been financially viable, that most plants have been built while heavily subsidised by governments, often motivated by military purposes, and that nuclear power is not a good approach to tackling climate change. It found, after reviewing trends in nuclear power plant construction since 1951, that the average 1,000MW nuclear power plant would incur an average economic loss of 4.8 billion euros ($7.7 billion AUD). This has been refuted by another study.Das DIW-Papier √ºber die ‚Äûteure und gef√§hrliche‚Äú Kernenergie auf dem Pr√ºfstand, Wendland, Peters; 2019  Capital costs  > \\"The usual rule of thumb for nuclear power is that about two thirds of the > generation cost is accounted for by fixed costs, the main ones being the > cost of paying interest on the loans and repaying the capital...\\" The > Doomsday Machine, Cohen and McKillop (Palgrave 2012) page 89 Capital cost, the building and financing of nuclear power plants, represents a large percentage of the cost of nuclear electricity. In 2014, the US Energy Information Administration estimated that for new nuclear plants going online in 2019, capital costs will make up 74% of the levelized cost of electricity; higher than the capital percentages for fossil-fuel power plants (63% for coal, 22% for natural gas), and lower than the capital percentages for some other nonfossil-fuel sources (80% for wind, 88% for solar PV). Areva, the French nuclear plant operator, offers that 70% of the cost of a kWh of nuclear electricity is accounted for by the fixed costs from the construction process. Some analysts argue (for example Steve Thomas, Professor of Energy Studies at the University of Greenwich in the UK, quoted in the book The Doomsday Machine by Martin Cohen and Andrew McKillop) that what is often not appreciated in debates about the economics of nuclear power is that the cost of equity, that is companies using their own money to pay for new plants, is generally higher than the cost of debt.The Doomsday Machine, Cohen and McKillop (Palgrave 2012) page 199 Another advantage of borrowing may be that \\"once large loans have been arranged at low interest rates ‚Äì perhaps with government support ‚Äì the money can then be lent out at higher rates of return\\". > \\"One of the big problems with nuclear power is the enormous upfront cost. > These reactors are extremely expensive to build. While the returns may be > very great, they're also very slow. It can sometimes take decades to recoup > initial costs. Since many investors have a short attention span, they don't > like to wait that long for their investment to pay off.\\" Because of the large capital costs for the initial nuclear power plants built as part of a sustained build program, and the relatively long construction period before revenue is returned, servicing the capital costs of first few nuclear power plants can be the most important factor determining the economic competitiveness of nuclear energy. The investment can contribute about 70% to 80% of the costs of electricity. Timothy Stone, businessman and nuclear expert, stated in 2017 \\"It has long been recognised that the only two numbers which matter in [new] nuclear power are the capital cost and the cost of capital.\\" The discount rate chosen to cost a nuclear power plant's capital over its lifetime is arguably the most sensitive parameter to overall costs. Because of the long life of new nuclear power plants, most of the value of a new nuclear power plant is created for the benefit of future generations. The recent liberalization of the electricity market in many countries has made the economics of nuclear power generation less attractive, and no new nuclear power plants have been built in a liberalized electricity market. Previously a monopolistic provider could guarantee output requirements decades into the future. Private generating companies now have to accept shorter output contracts and the risks of future lower-cost competition, so they desire a shorter return on investment period. This favours generation plant types with lower capital costs or high subsidies, even if associated fuel costs are higher. A further difficulty is that due to the large sunk costs but unpredictable future income from the liberalized electricity market, private capital is unlikely to be available on favourable terms, which is particularly significant for nuclear as it is capital-intensive. Industry consensus is that a 5% discount rate is appropriate for plants operating in a regulated utility environment where revenues are guaranteed by captive markets, and 10% discount rate is appropriate for a competitive deregulated or merchant plant environment; however the independent MIT study (2003) which used a more sophisticated finance model distinguishing equity and debt capital had a higher 11.5% average discount rate. As states are declining to finance nuclear power plants, the sector is now much more reliant on the commercial banking sector. According to research done by Dutch banking research group Profundo, commissioned by BankTrack, in 2008 private banks invested almost ‚Ç¨176 billion in the nuclear sector. Champions were BNP Paribas, with more than ‚Ç¨13,5 billion in nuclear investments and Citigroup and Barclays on par with both over ‚Ç¨11,4 billion in investments. Profundo added up investments in eighty companies in over 800 financial relationships with 124 banks in the following sectors: construction, electricity, mining, the nuclear fuel cycle and \\"other\\".  Cost overruns  Construction delays can add significantly to the cost of a plant. Because a power plant does not earn income and currencies can inflate during construction, longer construction times translate directly into higher finance charges. Modern nuclear power plants are planned for construction in five years or less (42 months for CANDU ACR-1000, 60 months from order to operation for an AP1000, 48 months from first concrete to operation for an EPR and 45 months for an ESBWR) as opposed to over a decade for some previous plants. However, despite Japanese success with ABWRs, two of the four EPRs under construction (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule. In the United States many new regulations were put in place in the years before and again immediately after the Three Mile Island accident's partial meltdown, resulting in plant startup delays of many years. The NRC has new regulations in place now (see Combined Construction and Operating License), and the next plants will have NRC Final Design Approval before the customer buys them, and a Combined Construction and Operating License will be issued before construction starts, guaranteeing that if the plant is built as designed then it will be allowed to operate‚Äîthus avoiding lengthy hearings after completion. In Japan and France, construction costs and delays are significantly diminished because of streamlined government licensing and certification procedures. In France, one model of reactor was type-certified, using a safety engineering process similar to the process used to certify aircraft models for safety. That is, rather than licensing individual reactors, the regulatory agency certified a particular design and its construction process to produce safe reactors. U.S. law permits type- licensing of reactors, a process which is being used on the AP1000 and the ESBWR. In Canada, cost overruns for the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, largely due to delays and policy changes, are often cited by opponents of new reactors. Construction started in 1981 at an estimated cost of $7.4 Billion 1993-adjusted CAD, and finished in 1993 at a cost of $14.5 billion. 70% of the price increase was due to interest charges incurred due to delays imposed to postpone units 3 and 4, 46% inflation over a 4-year period and other changes in financial policy. No new nuclear reactor has since been built in Canada, although a few have been and are undergoing refurbishment and environment assessment is complete for 4 new generation stations at Darlington with the Ontario government committed in keeping a nuclear base load of 50% or around 10GW. In the United Kingdom and the United States cost overruns on nuclear plants contributed to the bankruptcies of several utility companies. In the United States these losses helped usher in energy deregulation in the mid-1990s that saw rising electricity rates and power blackouts in California. When the UK began privatizing utilities, its nuclear reactors \\"were so unprofitable they could not be sold.\\" Eventually in 1996, the government gave them away. But the company that took them over, British Energy, had to be bailed out in 2004 to the extent of 3.4 billion pounds.  Operating costs  In general, coal and nuclear plants have the same types of operating costs (operations and maintenance plus fuel costs). However, nuclear has lower fuel costs but higher operating and maintenance costs.  Fuel costs  Nuclear plants require fissile fuel. Generally, the fuel used is uranium, although other materials may be used (See MOX fuel). In 2005, prices on the world market for uranium averaged US$20/lb (US$44.09/kg). On 2007-04-19, prices reached US$113/lb (US$249.12/kg).What's behind the red-hot uranium boom, 2007-04-19, CNN Money, Retrieved 2008-07-2 On 2008-07-02, the price had dropped to $59/lb. Fuel costs account for about 28% of a nuclear plant's operating expenses. As of 2013, half the cost of reactor fuel was taken up by enrichment and fabrication, so that the cost of the uranium concentrate raw material was 14 percent of operating costs. Doubling the price of uranium would add about 10% to the cost of electricity produced in existing nuclear plants, and about half that much to the cost of electricity in future power plants.World Nuclear, Economics of nuclear power, Feb. 2014. The cost of raw uranium contributes about $0.0015/kWh to the cost of nuclear electricity, while in breeder reactors the uranium cost falls to $0.000015/kWh. As of 2008, mining activity was growing rapidly, especially from smaller companies, but putting a uranium deposit into production takes 10 years or more. The world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of US$130/kg according to the industry groups Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are enough to last for \\"at least a century\\" at current consumption rates. According to the World Nuclear Association, \\"the world's present measured resources of uranium (5.7 Mt) in the cost category less than three times present spot prices and used only in conventional reactors, are enough to last for about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up.\\" The amount of uranium present in all currently known conventional reserves alone (excluding the huge quantities of currently-uneconomical uranium present in \\"unconventional\\" reserves such as phosphate/phosphorite deposits, seawater, and other sources) is enough to last over 200 years at current consumption rates. Fuel efficiency in conventional reactors has increased over time. Additionally, since 2000, 12‚Äì15% of world uranium requirements have been met by the dilution of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium from the decommissioning of nuclear weapons and related military stockpiles with depleted uranium, natural uranium, or partially-enriched uranium sources to produce low-enriched uranium for use in commercial power reactors. Similar efforts have been utilizing weapons-grade plutonium to produce mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, which is also produced from reprocessing used fuel. Other components of used fuel are currently less commonly utilized, but have a substantial capacity for reuse, especially so in next-generation fast neutron reactors. Over 35 European reactors are licensed to use MOX fuel, as well as Russian and American nuclear plants. Reprocessing of used fuel increases utilization by approximately 30%, while the widespread use of fast breeder reactors would allow for an increase of \\"50-fold or more\\" in utilization.  Waste disposal costs  All nuclear plants produce radioactive waste. To pay for the cost of storing, transporting and disposing these wastes in a permanent location, in the United States a surcharge of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour is added to electricity bills. Roughly one percent of electrical utility bills in provinces using nuclear power are diverted to fund nuclear waste disposal in Canada. In 2009, the Obama administration announced that the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository would no longer be considered the answer for U.S. civilian nuclear waste. Currently, there is no plan for disposing of the waste and plants will be required to keep the waste on the plant premises indefinitely. The disposal of low level waste reportedly costs around ¬£2,000/m¬≥ in the UK. High level waste costs somewhere between ¬£67,000/m¬≥ and ¬£201,000/m¬≥. General division is 80%/20% of low level/high level waste, and one reactor produces roughly 12 m¬≥ of high level waste annually.Nuclear Energy Data 2008, OECD, p. 48 (the Netherlands, Borssele nuclear power plant) In Canada, the NWMO was created in 2002 to oversee long term disposal of nuclear waste, and in 2007 adopted the Adapted Phased Management procedure. Long term management is subject to change based on technology and public opinion, but currently largely follows the recommendations for a centralized repository as first extensively outlined by AECL in 1988. It was determined after extensive review that following these recommendations would safely isolate the waste from the biosphere. The location has not yet been determined, and the project is expected to cost between $9 and $13 billion CAD for construction and operation for 60‚Äì90 years, employing roughly a thousand people for the duration. Funding is available and has been collected since 1978 under the Canadian Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program. Very long term monitoring requires less staff since high-level waste is less toxic than naturally occurring uranium ore deposits within a few centuries. The primary argument for pursuing IFR-style technology today is that it provides the best solution to the existing nuclear waste problem because fast reactors can be fueled from the waste products of existing reactors as well as from the plutonium used in weapons, as is the case of the discontinued EBR-II in Arco, Idaho, and in the operating, as of 2014, BN-800 reactor. Depleted uranium (DU) waste can also be used as fuel in fast reactors. Waste produced by a fast-neutron reactor and a pyroelectric refiner would consist only of fission products, which are produced at a rate of about one tonne per GWe-year. This is 5% as much as present reactors produce, and needs special custody for only 300 years instead of 300,000. Only 9.2% of fission products (strontium and caesium) contribute 99% of radiotoxicity; at some additional cost, these could be separated, reducing the disposal problem by a further factor of ten.  Decommissioning  At the end of a nuclear plant's lifetime, the plant must be decommissioned. This entails either dismantling, safe storage or entombment. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires plants to finish the process within 60 years of closing. Since it may cost $500 million or more to shut down and decommission a plant, the NRC requires plant owners to set aside money when the plant is still operating to pay for the future shutdown costs.Decommissioning a Nuclear Power Plant, 2007-4-20, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Retrieved 2007-6-12 Decommissioning a reactor that has undergone a meltdown is inevitably more difficult and expensive. Three Mile Island was decommissioned 14 years after its incident for $837 million. The cost of the Fukushima disaster cleanup is not yet known, but has been estimated to cost around $100 billion. Chernobyl is not yet decommissioned, different estimates put the end date between 2013 and 2020.  Proliferation and terrorism  A 2011 report for the Union of Concerned Scientists stated that \\"the costs of preventing nuclear proliferation and terrorism should be recognized as negative externalities of civilian nuclear power, thoroughly evaluated, and integrated into economic assessments‚Äîjust as global warming emissions are increasingly identified as a cost in the economics of coal-fired electricity\\". \\"Construction of the ELWR was completed in 2013 and is optimized for civilian electricity production, but it has \\"dual-use\\" potential and can be modified to produce material for nuclear weapons.\\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/15/asia/north-korea-nuclear-reactors- activity/index.html  Safety, security and accidents  2000 candles in memory of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, at a commemoration 25 years after the nuclear accident, as well as for the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. Nuclear safety and security is a chief goal of the nuclear industry. Great care is taken so that accidents are avoided, and if unpreventable, have limited consequences. Accidents could stem from system failures related to faulty construction or pressure vessel embrittlement due to prolonged radiation exposure. As with any aging technology, risks of failure increase over time, and since many currently operating nuclear reactors were built in the mid 20th century, care must be taken to ensure proper operation. Many more recent reactor designs have been proposed, most of which include passive safety systems. These design considerations serve to significantly mitigate or totally prevent major accidents from occurring, even in the event of a system failure. Still, reactors must be designed, built, and operated properly to minimize accident risks. The Fukushima disaster represents one instance where these systems were not comprehensive enough, where the tsunami following the T≈çhoku earthquake disabled the backup generators that were stabilizing the reactor. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, at least four core damage incidents would be expected in that period (assuming only current designs were used ‚Äì the number of incidents expected in that same time period with the use of advanced designs is only one). To date, there have been five core damage incidents in the world since 1970 (one at Three Mile Island in 1979; one at Chernobyl in 1986; and three at Fukushima-Daiichi in 2011), corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation II reactors. According to the Paul Scherrer Institute, the Chernobyl incident is the only incident ever to have caused any fatalities. The report that UNSCEAR presented to the UN General Assembly in 2011 states that 29 plant workers and emergency responders died from effects of radiation exposure, two died from causes related to the incident but unrelated to radiation, and one died from coronary thrombosis. It attributed fifteen cases of fatal thyroid cancer to the incident. It said there is no evidence the incident caused an ongoing increase in incidence of solid tumors or blood cancers in Eastern Europe. In terms of nuclear accidents, the Union of Concerned Scientists have claimed that \\"reactor owners ... have never been economically responsible for the full costs and risks of their operations. Instead, the public faces the prospect of severe losses in the event of any number of potential adverse scenarios, while private investors reap the rewards if nuclear plants are economically successful. For all practical purposes, nuclear power's economic gains are privatized, while its risks are socialized\\". However, the problem of insurance costs for worst- case scenarios is not unique to nuclear power: hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the Banqiao Dam disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large dam failures in general. Private insurers base dam insurance premiums on worst-case scenarios, so insurance for major disasters in this sector is likewise provided by the state. In the US, insurance coverage for nuclear reactors is provided by the combination of operator-purchased private insurance and the primarily operator-funded Price Anderson Act. Any effort to construct a new nuclear facility around the world, whether an existing design or an experimental future design, must deal with NIMBY or NIABY objections. Because of the high profiles of the Three Mile Island accident and Chernobyl disaster, relatively few municipalities welcome a new nuclear reactor, processing plant, transportation route, or deep geological repository within their borders, and some have issued local ordinances prohibiting the locating of such facilities there. Nancy Folbre, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, has questioned the economic viability of nuclear power following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents: > The proven dangers of nuclear power amplify the economic risks of expanding > reliance on it. Indeed, the stronger regulation and improved safety features > for nuclear reactors called for in the wake of the Japanese disaster will > almost certainly require costly provisions that may price it out of the > market. The cascade of problems at Fukushima, from one reactor to another, and from reactors to fuel storage pools, will affect the design, layout and ultimately the cost of future nuclear plants. In 1986, Pete Planchon conducted a demonstration of the inherent safety of the Integral Fast Reactor. Safety interlocks were turned off. Coolant circulation was turned off. Core temperature rose from the usual 1000 degrees Fahrenheit to 1430 degrees within 20 seconds. The boiling temperature of the sodium coolant is 1621 degrees. Within seven minutes the reactor had shut itself down without action from the operators, without valves, pumps, computers, auxiliary power, or any moving parts. The temperature was below the operating temperature. The reactor was not damaged. The operators were not injured. There was no release of radioactive material. The reactor was restarted with coolant circulation but the steam generator disconnected. The same scenario recurred. Three weeks later, the operators at Chernobyl repeated the latter experiment, ironically in a rush to complete a safety test, using a very different reactor, with tragic consequences. Safety of the Integral Fast Reactor depends on the composition and geometry of the core, not efforts by operators or computer algorithms.  Insurance  Insurance available to the operators of nuclear power plants varies by nation. The worst case nuclear accident costs are so large that it would be difficult for the private insurance industry to carry the size of the risk, and the premium cost of full insurance would make nuclear energy uneconomic. Nuclear power has largely worked under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the Paris convention on nuclear third-party liability, the Brussels supplementary convention, the Vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage,Publications: Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. International Atomic Energy Agency. and in the United States the Price- Anderson Act. It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity. However, the problem of insurance costs for worst-case scenarios is not unique to nuclear power: hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the Banqiao Dam disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or large dam failures in general. Private insurers base dam insurance premiums on worst-case scenarios, so insurance for major disasters in this sector is likewise provided by the state. In Canada, the Canadian Nuclear Liability Act requires nuclear power plant operators to obtain $650 million (CAD) of liability insurance coverage per installation (regardless of the number of individual reactors present) starting in 2017 (up from the prior $75 million requirement established in 1976), increasing to $750 million in 2018, to $850 million in 2019, and finally to $1 billion in 2020. Claims beyond the insured amount would be assessed by a government appointed but independent tribunal, and paid by the federal government. In the UK, the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 governs liability for nuclear damage for which a UK nuclear licensee is responsible. The limit for the operator is ¬£140 million. In the United States, the Price-Anderson Act has governed the insurance of the nuclear power industry since 1957. Owners of nuclear power plants are required to pay a premium each year for the maximum obtainable amount of private insurance ($450 million) for each licensed reactor unit. This primary or \\"first tier\\" insurance is supplemented by a second tier. In the event a nuclear accident incurs damages in excess of $450 million, each licensee would be assessed a prorated share of the excess up to $121,255,000. With 104 reactors currently licensed to operate, this secondary tier of funds contains about $12.61 billion. This results in a maximum combined primary+secondary coverage amount of up to $13.06 billion for a hypothetical single-reactor incident. If 15 percent of these funds are expended, prioritization of the remaining amount would be left to a federal district court. If the second tier is depleted, Congress is committed to determine whether additional disaster relief is required. In July 2005, Congress extended the Price-Anderson Act to newer facilities. The Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy put in place two similar international frameworks for nuclear liability. The limits for the conventions vary. The Vienna convention was adapted in 2004 to increase the operator liability to ‚Ç¨700 million per incident, but this modification is not yet ratified.  Cost per kWh  The cost per unit of electricity produced (kWh) will vary according to country, depending on costs in the area, the regulatory regime and consequent financial and other risks, and the availability and cost of finance. Costs will also depend on geographic factors such as availability of cooling water, earthquake likelihood, and availability of suitable power grid connections. So it is not possible to accurately estimate costs on a global basis. Commodity prices rose in 2008, and so all types of plants became more expensive than previously calculated. In June 2008 Moody's estimated that the cost of installing new nuclear capacity in the United States might possibly exceed $7,000/KWe in final cost.Platts: A utility's credit quality could be negatively impacted by building a new nuclear power plant, 2 June 2008, Moody's Investors Service In comparison, the reactor units already under construction in China have been reported with substantially lower costs due to significantly lower labour rates. In 2009, MIT updated its 2003 study, concluding that inflation and rising construction costs had increased the overnight cost of nuclear power plants to about $4,000/kWe, and thus increased the power cost to $0.084/kWh. The 2003 study had estimated the cost as $0.067/kWh. A 2013 study indicates that the cost competitiveness of nuclear power is \\"questionable\\" and that public support will be required if new power stations are to be built within liberalized electricity markets. In 2014, the US Energy Information Administration estimated the levelized cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants going online in 2019 to be $0.096/kWh before government subsidies, comparable to the cost of electricity from a new coal-fired power plant without carbon capture, but higher than the cost from natural gas-fired plants. In 2019 the US EIA revised the levelized cost of electricity from new advanced nuclear power plants going online in 2023 to be $0.0775/kWh before government subsidies, using a regulated industry 4.3% cost of capital (WACC - pre-tax 6.6%) over a 30-year cost recovery period. Financial firm Lazard also updated its levelized cost of electricity report costing new nuclear at between $0.118/kWh and $0.192/kWh using a commercial 7.7% cost of capital (WACC - pre-tax 12% cost for the higher-risk 40% equity finance and 8% cost for the 60% loan finance) over a 40 year lifetime.  Comparisons with other power sources  thumb Generally, a nuclear power plant is significantly more expensive to build than an equivalent coal-fueled or gas-fueled plant. If natural gas is plentiful and cheap operating costs of conventional power plants is less. Most forms of electricity generation produce some form of negative externality ‚Äî costs imposed on third parties that are not directly paid by the producer ‚Äî such as pollution which negatively affects the health of those near and downwind of the power plant, and generation costs often do not reflect these external costs. A comparison of the \\"real\\" cost of various energy sources is complicated by a number of uncertainties: *The cost of climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases is hard to estimate. Carbon taxes may be enacted, or carbon capture and storage may become mandatory. *The cost of environmental damage caused by any energy source through land use (whether for mining fuels or for power generation), air and water pollution, solid waste production, manufacturing-related damages (such as from mining and processing ores or rare earth elements), etc. *The cost and political feasibility of disposal of the waste from reprocessed spent nuclear fuel is still not fully resolved. In the United States, the ultimate disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel are assumed by the U.S. government after producers pay a fixed surcharge. *Operating reserve requirements are different for different generation methods. When nuclear units shut down unexpectedly they tend to do so independently, so the \\"hot spinning reserve\\" must be at least the size of the largest unit. On the other hand, some renewable energy sources (such as solar/wind power) are intermittent power sources with uncontrollably varying outputs, so the grid will require a combination of demand response, extra long-range transmission infrastructure, and large-scale energy storage. (Some firm renewables such as hydroelectricity have a storage reservoir and can be used as reliable back-up power for other power sources.) *Potential governmental instabilities in the plant's lifetime. Modern nuclear reactors are designed for a minimum operational lifetime of 60 years (extendible to 100+ years), compared to the 40 years (extendible to 60+ years) that older reactors were designed for. *Actual plant lifetime (to date, no nuclear plant has been shut down solely due to reaching its licensed lifetime. Over 87 reactors in the United States have been granted extended operating licenses to 60 years of operation by the NRC , and subsequent license renewals could extend that to 80 years. Modern nuclear reactors are also designed to last longer than older reactors as outlined above, allowing for even further increased plant lifetimes.) *Due to the dominant role of initial construction costs and the multi-year construction time, the interest rate for the capital required (as well as the timeline that the plant is completed in) has a major impact on the total cost of building a new nuclear plant. Lazard's report on the estimated levelized cost of energy by source (10th edition) estimated unsubsidized prices of $97‚Äì$136/MWh for nuclear, $50‚Äì$60/MWh for solar PV, $32‚Äì$62/MWh for onshore wind, and $82‚Äì$155/MWh for offshore wind.https://www.lazard.com/media/438038/levelized-cost-of-energy-v100.pdf However, the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry do not involve cash payments. Rather, they shift construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers, burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns, defaults to accidents, and nuclear waste management. This approach has remained remarkably consistent throughout the nuclear industry's history, and distorts market choices that would otherwise favor less risky energy investments. In 2011, Benjamin K. Sovacool said that: \\"When the full nuclear fuel cycle is considered ‚Äî not only reactors but also uranium mines and mills, enrichment facilities, spent fuel repositories, and decommissioning sites ‚Äî nuclear power proves to be one of the costliest sources of energy\\". In 2014, Brookings Institution published The Net Benefits of Low and No-Carbon Electricity Technologies which states, after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis, that \\"The net benefits of new nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants\\", with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power. Moreover, Paul Joskow of MIT maintains that the \\"Levelized cost of electricity\\" (LCOE) metric is a poor means of comparing electricity sources as it hides the extra costs, such as the need to frequently operate back up power stations, incurred due to the use of intermittent power sources such as wind energy, while the value of baseload power sources are underpresented. A 2017 focused response to these claims, particularly \\"baseload\\" or \\"back up\\", by Amory Lovins in 2017, countered with statistics from operating grids.  Other economic issues  Kristin Shrader- Frechette analysed 30 papers on the economics of nuclear power for possible conflicts of interest. She found of the 30, 18 had been funded either by the nuclear industry or pro-nuclear governments and were pro-nuclear, 11 were funded by universities or non-profit non-government organisations and were anti-nuclear, the remaining 1 had unknown sponsors and took the pro-nuclear stance. The pro-nuclear studies were accused of using cost-trimming methods such as ignoring government subsidies and using industry projections above empirical evidence where ever possible. The situation was compared to medical research where 98% of industry sponsored studies return positive results. Nuclear Power plants tend to be very competitive in areas where other fuel resources are not readily available ‚Äî France, most notably, has almost no native supplies of fossil fuels. France's nuclear power experience has also been one of paradoxically increasing rather than decreasing costs over time. Making a massive investment of capital in a project with long-term recovery might affect a company's credit rating. A Council on Foreign Relations report on nuclear energy argues that a rapid expansion of nuclear power may create shortages in building materials such as reactor-quality concrete and steel, skilled workers and engineers, and safety controls by skilled inspectors. This would drive up current prices. It may be easier to rapidly expand, for example, the number of coal power plants, without this having a large effect on current prices. Existing nuclear plants generally have a somewhat limited ability to significantly vary their output in order to match changing demand (a practice called load following). However, many BWRs, some PWRs (mainly in France), and certain CANDU reactors (primarily those at Bruce Nuclear Generating Station) have various levels of load-following capabilities (sometimes substantial), which allow them to fill more than just baseline generation needs. Several newer reactor designs also offer some form of enhanced load-following capability. For example, the Areva EPR can slew its electrical output power between 990 and 1,650 MW at 82.5 MW per minute. The number of companies that manufacture certain parts for nuclear reactors is limited, particularly the large forgings used for reactor vessels and steam systems. Only four companies (Japan Steel Works, China First Heavy Industries, Russia's OMZ Izhora and Korea's Doosan Heavy Industries) currently manufacture pressure vessels for reactors of 1100 MWe or larger. Some have suggested that this poses a bottleneck that could hamper expansion of nuclear power internationally, however, some Western reactor designs require no steel pressure vessel such as CANDU derived reactors which rely on individual pressurized fuel channels. The large forgings for steam generators ‚Äî although still very heavy ‚Äî can be produced by a far larger number of suppliers. For a country with both a nuclear power industry and a nuclear arms industry synergies between the two can favor a nuclear power plant with an otherwise uncertain economy. For example, in the United Kingdom researchers have informed MPs that the government was using the Hinkley Point C project to cross-subsidise the UK military's nuclear-related activity by maintaining nuclear skills. In support of that, the researchers from the University of Sussex, Prof. Andy Stirling and Dr. Phil Johnstone, stated that the costs of the Trident nuclear submarine programme would be prohibitive without ‚Äúan effective subsidy from electricity consumers to military nuclear infrastructure‚Äù.  Recent trends  Brunswick Nuclear Plant discharge canal The Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, the largest nuclear power facility in the world The nuclear power industry in Western nations has a history of construction delays, cost overruns, plant cancellations, and nuclear safety issues despite significant government subsidies and support. In December 2013, Forbes magazine reported that, in developed countries, \\"reactors are not a viable source of new power\\". Even in developed nations where they make economic sense, they are not feasible because nuclear's ‚Äúenormous costs, political and popular opposition, and regulatory uncertainty‚Äù. This view echoes the statement of former Exelon CEO John Rowe, who said in 2012 that new nuclear plants ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make any sense right now‚Äù and won't be economically viable in the foreseeable future. John Quiggin, economics professor, also says the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically- viable. Quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialization. Former NRC member Peter A. Bradford and Professor Ian Lowe have recently made similar statements. However, some \\"nuclear cheerleaders\\" and lobbyists in the West continue to champion reactors, often with proposed new but largely untested designs, as a source of new power. Significant new build activity is occurring in developing countries like South Korea, India and China. China has 25 reactors under construction, However, according to a government research unit, China must not build \\"too many nuclear power reactors too quickly\\", in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel, equipment and qualified plant workers. The 1.6 GWe EPR reactor is being built in Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant, Finland. A joint effort of French AREVA and German Siemens AG, it will be the largest pressurized water reactor (PWR) in the world. The Olkiluoto project has been claimed to have benefited from various forms of government support and subsidies, including liability limitations, preferential financing rates, and export credit agency subsidies, but the European Commission's investigation didn't find anything illegal in the proceedings. However, as of August 2009, the project is \\"more than three years behind schedule and at least 55% over budget, reaching a total cost estimate of ‚Ç¨5 billion ($7 billion) or close to ‚Ç¨3,100 ($4,400) per kilowatt\\".Mycle Schneider, Steve Thomas, Antony Froggatt, Doug Koplow (August 2009). The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2009 Commissioned by German Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety, p. 7. Finnish electricity consumers interest group ElFi OY evaluated in 2007 the effect of Olkiluoto-3 to be slightly over 6%, or ‚Ç¨3/MWh, to the average market price of electricity within Nord Pool Spot. The delay is therefore costing the Nordic countries over 1.3 billion euros per year as the reactor would replace more expensive methods of production and lower the price of electricity. Russia has launched the world's first floating nuclear power plant. The ¬£100 million vessel, the Akademik Lomonosov, is the first of seven plants (70 MWe per ship) that Moscow says will bring vital energy resources to remote Russian regions. Startup of the first of the ships two reactors was announced in December 2018.http://www.rosenergoatom.ru/zhurnalistam/main-news/29791/ Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats. After Fukushima, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity built by 2035. Many license applications filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for proposed new reactors have been suspended or cancelled.Eileen O'Grady. Entergy says nuclear remains costly Reuters, May 25, 2010.Terry Ganey. AmerenUE pulls plug on project Columbia Daily Tribune, April 23, 2009. As of October 2011, plans for about 30 new reactors in the United States have been reduced to 14. There are currently five new nuclear plants under construction in the United States (Watts Bar 2, Summer 2, Summer 3, Vogtle 3, Vogtle 4). Matthew Wald from The New York Times has reported that \\"the nuclear renaissance is looking small and slow\\". In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive reactors were permanently closed in the US: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin. The Vermont Yankee plant closed in 2014. New York State is seeking to close Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City. The additional cancellation of five large reactor uprates (Prairie Island, 1 reactor, LaSalle, 2 reactors, and Limerick, 2 reactors), four by the largest nuclear company in the United States, suggest that the nuclear industry faces \\"a broad range of operational and economic problems\\". As of July 2013, economist Mark Cooper has identified some US nuclear power plants that face particularly significant challenges to their continued operation due to regulatory policies. These are Palisades, Fort Calhoun (meanwhile closed for economical reasons), Nine Mile Point, Fitzpatrick, Ginna, Oyster Creek (same as Ft. Calhoun), Vermont Yankee (same as Ft. Calhoun), Millstone, Clinton, Indian Point. Cooper said the lesson here for policy makers and economists is clear: \\"nuclear reactors are simply not competitive\\". In 2017 analysis by Bloomberg showed that over half of U.S. nuclear plants were running at a loss, first of all those at a single unit site.

Lord Howard de Walden was also a powerboat racer who competed for Great Britain in the 1908 Summer Olympics. Early life Thomas Ellis was born in London on 9 May 1880. He was baptised with the name of Thomas Evelyn Ellis, and was known within his family as \\"Tommy\\". Educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1917 he assumed the surname Scott-Ellis by Royal Licence. Military career Commissioned into the 10th Hussars as a second-lieutenant on 19 April 1899, he saw active military service in the Second Boer War and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1900.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1902 Following the end of that war, he retired from active service in August 1902. He was appointed a captain (supernumerary) in the 2nd County of London Yeomanry (Westminster Dragoons) on 13 September 1902. Scott-Ellis resumed active military service during World War I, being promoted Major in the Royal Tank Corps. Collecting and interests After succeeding to his family titles in 1899 he received his inherited estates when he came of age in 1901. This included a large part of Marylebone, London and earned him the title of 'Britain's wealthiest bachelor'. His fortune derived from his grandmother‚Äôs estates which she had inherited as daughter of the Duke of Portland. The Ellis family estates, built on slavery and sugar estates in Jamaica, primarily Montpelier, Jamaica had been conveyed by his grandmother to his uncle, Evelyn Henry Ellis, in 1891.Barry Higman, Montpelier (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 1998), p. 67. Lord Howard de Walden took a lease on Audley End House, Essex which had once belonged to his ancestors, in 1904 but reportedly never felt settled there. The artist Auguste Rodin created a bust of Lord Howard de Walden in 1906 which is held in the collection kept at the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia. In 1911, in preparation for his marriage, he leased Chirk Castle, Denbighshire, which became his main residence after World War I until 1946, and where he learned the Welsh language; he later served as president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales from 1931 to 1945.Brace M '‚ÄòThe History of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales'‚Äô, CPRW Welshpool, 2004. pg46. In 1934 he served as treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury, Lord Howard de Walden became a keen heraldist and genealogist, as well as amassing one of the most extensive collections of British armour, most of which is now on display at Dean Castle, Kilmarnock. As a crew member of the Dylan he participated in the first and only motor boat competitions at the Olympics of 1908 in London. His steam yacht, Branwen, length overall, launched 28 October 1905 was the first vessel built at the John I. Thornycroft & Company's Woolston yard. In 1914 he provided financial support for the creation of Crab Tree Club in London and also in that year he was one of the people \\"blessed\\" in Wyndham Lewis's Blast magazine. Lord Howard de Walden was also an author, who produced several plays under the pseudonym of T. E. Ellis.Welsh Biography Online. Accessed 16 June 2014 Dispute with John Lewis John Lewis of the eponymous department store on Oxford Street engaged in a protracted legal dispute with de Walden, his ground landlord, over the Holles Street premises. The litigation went through the courts for twenty- three years and cost Lewis ¬£40,000. At one point John Lewis was sent to Brixton Jail for contempt of court, and de Walden sued him for libel following his erection of placards at his stores. The case was eventually settled amicably.

It is managed by Kent Wildlife Trust as the Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve and Jeffery Harrison Visitor Centre.  History  The site was converted from gravel-pit to nature reserve by the Harrison family - particularly Jeffery Harrison, after whom the visitor centre is named. As such, the site is almost totally man-made - nearly all trees on the site were manually planted, and the lakes and ponds were created by excavating and flooding former gravel workings with water from the River Darent. As such, the site represented the first such conversion of a gravel- pit anywhere in the United Kingdom. Large areas of gravel and sand were replaced with woodland, supporting birds such as woodpeckers, warblers and tits, as well as other migratory birds. These include siskins - a bird that comes in the winter months to feed on alder seeds. Areas of the reserve have been left to mature and reach old age, with plenty of dead wood habitat for fungi and insects. In contrast, other sections see the trees are coppiced to create open areas and denser woodland with its own community of plants and animals. The reserve further includes five lakes and a mixed habitat of ponds, seasonally flooded pools, and reedbed; and the combination of wetland and woodland enables the reserve to support a diverse community of plants, fungi and animals. As of 2006, over two thousand species have been identified on the site.  SSSI designation  According to the notification for the site, the interest of Sevenoaks Gravel Pits centres on its breeding bird populations. The combination of water features such as shallows, spits and islands, as well as the planting of trees and aquatic plants, have provided conditions suitable for both breeding and wintering birds. The water levels in the lake are managed so that islands and shallows are exposed during spring and summer, creating feeding and nesting areas for a variety of waders and water fowl including the little ringed plover, lapwing, moorhen, coot and great crested grebe. Large numbers of wildfowl regularly use the open water in the winter months such as the tufted duck, greylag and Canada geese. Canada and greylag geese, alongside the mallard and tufted duck are the most numerous breeding species on the site, although wintering and passage wildfowl are also attracted including the pochard, shelduck, teal and shoveller. Equally, passage waders such as the greenshank and green sandpiper, as well as the uncommon little ringed plover, are regular breeding species on the site. Song birds, including the whitethroat, reed, and sedge warblers can be found in the woodland and reed beds on the site, while sand martins - a species that has undergone major fluctuations in recent years - have a significant colony in a sand face towards the south of the site. The Gravel Pits' SSSI notification also notes the growing botanical and entomological interest of the site, with thirteen species of Odonata (dragonflies) including the locally distributed downy-emerald dragonfly Cordulia aenea. Plants of note include small cud-weed Filago minima, dwarf elder Sambucus ebulus, and slender bird's-foot trefoil Lotus angustissimus.

Between April 1850 and December 1850, Macfarlane wrote three essays for George Julian Harney's monthly, the Democratic Review and ten articles for his weekly paper, the Red Republican (which changed its name to the Friend of the People in December 1850). In 1851 Macfarlane \\"disappeared\\" from the political scene. Until recent research by Macfarlane's biographer, David Black and BBC Radio Scotland researcher and broadcaster, Louise Yeoman, very little was known for sure about her early and later life. Yeoman writes of Macfarlane: ‚ÄúIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a period drama must be in want of a feisty heroine who finds love at last. But our heroine, Helen Macfarlane was no fictional character and her life would have shocked Jane Austen‚Äôs smocks off.‚Äù Louise Yeoman, ‚ÄúHelen Macfarlane ‚Äì the radical feminist admired by Karl Marx,‚Äù BBC News, 25 November 2012 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- scotland-20475989 Early life Helen‚Äôs father, George Macfarlane [or McFarlane] (1760‚Äì1842), was an owner of calico-printing works at Crossmill, Barrhead and at Campsie in Stirlingshire. Her mother, n√©e Helen Stenhouse (born 1772), came from a similar middle-class family of calico-printers. Both families prospered in the production of 'Turkey Red' bandanas, which were very popular fashion items. Helen was the youngest of the Macfarlanes' eleven children. The workforce in the calico mills was highly unionised, but during the economic distress of the 1830s, the calico printers went on strike against the introduction of unskilled labour. The mill-owners (including the Macfarlanes) were able to call on the government to break the strike by sending in the Dragoons. There is however, some evidence of radicalism in the Macfarlane-Stenhouse families, and especially in their calico printworks. According to Yeoman, ‚ÄúIn the Stenhouse works in Barrhead, the workers were solid supporters of Chartism, the big movement founded [in 1839] to get votes for working people. Here they were all solid Chartists, solid radicals, so radical even the tulips are radical, because the works manager, his pride and joy were his tulips. They were all beautiful, they all had names, all had pedigrees and his best, his beautiful, tallest, most symmetrical tulips were all named after his favourite radical politicians. So if you're having a works manager who's a convinced radical, maybe the Stenhouses who own the place are a bit radical. Which makes me wonder if Helen drank in her radical politics from her mother's milk.‚Äù BBC, \\"Woman with a Past ‚Äì Helen Macfarlane,\\" Broadcast 26 November 2012. In 1842 the Macfarlane mills went under, engulfed by the rising tide of technology-driven competition between Scottish millowners. The Macfarlanes are utterly ruined. Helen and her sisters and brothers had to sign away everything, including their mills and their fine house at 5 Royal Crescent, Glasgow. In Helen's case the prospect of a genteel marriage perhaps to a rising young lawyer or the son of a good merchant was gone and she had to take employment as a governess.BBC, \\"Women with a Past ‚Äì Helen Macfarlane\\" The year 1848 found Helen Macfarlane in Vienna when the Revolution in Vienna against the Habsburg Monarchy broke out.David Black, Helen Macfarlane (2004), p. 44 Later, in a critique of Thomas Carlyle, she wrote: ‚ÄúI am free to confess that, for me the most joyful of all spectacles possible in these times is the one which Mr. Carlyle laments; one which I enjoyed extremely at Vienna, in March 1848, i.e. 'an universal tumbling of impostors...' For it amounts to this, that men are determined to live no longer in lies... Ca ira! And how do men come to perceive that the old social forms are worn out and useless? By the advent of a new Idea...‚Äù Helen Macfarlane, ‚ÄúDemocracy ‚Äì Remarks on the Times apropos of certain passages in no. 1 of Thomas Carlyle‚Äôs ‚Äòlatter-day‚Äô pamphlet,‚Äù Democratic Review, April, May and June 1850. Writings Following the post-1848 counter-revolutions, Macfarlane returned to Britain, first residing in Burnley, Lancashire, then in London. She began to write for the presses of George Julian Harney, and associated herself with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (who, in exile, had taken up residence in London and Manchester respectively). Macfarlane‚Äôs first articles for Harney‚Äôs monthly Democratic Review appeared under her own name in the April, May and June 1850 issues. Then, when she began to write for Harney‚Äôs weekly, the Red Republican in June 1850, she began using the nom de plume, Howard Morton (the real identity of ‚ÄúMorton‚Äù was first revealed bt A.R. Schoyen in 1958 in his biography of Harney).A. R. Schoyen, The Chartist Challenge, p.203. Her translation of the Communist Manifesto appeared in the Red Republican in four parts ( 9, 16, 23 and 30 November 1850). Macfarlane‚Äôs own writings show a grasp of German philosophy (especially Hegel) that was unique to British radicals of the period. Surpisingly, for a ‚ÄúMarxist‚Äù perhaps, Macfarlane found common ground between Christ and Communism: ‚ÄúUpon the doctrine of man‚Äôs divinity, rests the distinction between a person and a thing. It is the reason why the most heinous crime I can perpetrate is invading the personality of my brother man, using him up in any way from murder and slavery downwards. Red Republicanism, or democracy, is a protest against the using up of man by man. It is the endeavour to reduce the golden rule of Jesus to practice. Modern democracy is Christianity in a form adapted to the wants of the present age. It is Christianity divested of its mythological envelope. It is the idea appearing as pure thought, independent of history and tradition.‚Äù ‚ÄúHoward Morton‚Äù (Helen Macfarlane), ‚ÄúFine Words (Household of otherwise) Butter No Parsnips.‚Äù Red Republican, 20 July 1850. Quoted in BBC Women With A Past (op. cit.). On organised religion, Macfarlane complained, ‚ÄúAll sects hedge me in with limitations. I cannot move a step in any direction without running into some creed, or catechism, or formula, which rises up like a wall between the unhappy sectarians and the rest of the universe; beyond which it is forbidden to look on pain of damnation, or worse.‚Äù Helen Macfarlane, ‚ÄúDemocracy,‚Äù Democratic Review, op. cit. In her writings on the politics of the Chartists, socialists and radicals of her day Macfarlane saw a similar problem of ‚Äúsectarianism.‚Äù In calling for the organizational unity of the forces of \\"social propaganda\\" and \\"democratic agitation\\", Macfarlane saw Chartist organizational practice as ineffectual when compared to that of the French Blanquists: ‚ÄúHow comes it that our French brothers have done so much compared with us? Because they are organized into one compact mass, which, under the guidance of competent leaders, moves like an army of well-disciplined soldiers, steadily onward to a given point. That is the reason of it. Frenchmen have the instinct of military discipline. We, on the other hand, carry the Saxon principle of the local management and the infinitesimal division of interests, too far. Absolutely this will not do in fighting a battle.‚Äù ‚ÄúHoward Morton‚Äù (Helen Macfarlane), ‚ÄúA Birds Eye View of the Glorious British Constitution,‚Äù Democratic Review, September 1850, The one mainstream periodical to have good word to say about the Red Republican was Reynolds Weekly News, a Sunday paper founded in May 1850 by the physical-force Chartist, George W.M. Reynolds (1814‚Äì79). Reynolds, knowing that Harney was having serious problems with the distributors and Her Majesty's Stamp Office, wrote: ‚ÄúThis admirably conducted periodical is doing its work bravely. Energy, fearlessness, talent and variety combine to sustain its interest and value. Mr. Harney in his letters signed 'L'Ami du Peuple' exhibits sound, statesman- like views, and shows up existing abuses with a merciless hand. His contributor Howard Morton is also a man of intelligence and shrewdness...‚Äù Reynolds Weekly News 6 October 1850. A Times leader quoted the following lines from Macfarlane‚Äôs translation of the Communist Manifesto as ‚Äúevil teachings‚Äù: ‚ÄúYour Middle-class gentry are not satisfied with having the wives and daughters of their Wages-slaves at their disposal, ‚Äì not to mention the innumerable public prostitutes ‚Äì but they take a particular pleasure in seducing each other's wives. Middle-class marriage is in reality a community of wives.‚Äù Communist Manifest (Macfarlane translation, appendix, D. Black, ‚Äò‚ÄôHelen macfarlane‚Äô‚Äô pp. 137‚Äì171. The Times commented: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ only now and then when some startling fact is brought before us do we entertain even the suspicion that there is a society close to our own, and with which we are in the habits of daily intercourse, of which we are as completely ignorant as if it dwelt in another land, of another language in which we never conversed, which in fact we never saw.‚Äù ‚ÄúLiterature of the Poor,‚Äù Times leader, 2 September 1851. Macfarlane fell out with her editor Harney at the end of 1850, The occasion was a New Year‚Äôs banquet, organised by Harney at the Literary and Scientific Institute, near Fitzroy Square in London, attended by Chartists and numerous exiled European revolutionaries, including Karl and Jenny Marx and Engels. According to Marx, Harney's wife Mary (like Helen Macfarlane a Scot) told Jenny Marx that she had declined Helen's acquaintance because of the antics of a man referred to as the \\"cleft dragoon\\" who, the evidence suggests, was Helen's fianc√©e, Francis Proust, a revolutionary exile previously resident in Belgium. According to Marx, ‚ÄúHarney was stupid and cowardly enough not to let her get her own back for the insult, and so break, in the most undignified way, with the only collaborator on his spouting rag who had original ideas ‚Äì a rare bird, on his paper...\\"Marx to Engels 23 February 1851. Black, pp.113‚Äì120. Later life In 1852 Helen Macfarlane married Francis Proust and in 1853 gave birth to a daughter who they named Consuela Pauline Roland Proust (Consuela after the heroine of the George Sands novel, and Pauline Roland after the noted French socialist feminist thinker 1805‚Äì52). In 1853 the family took a ship to Natal, South Africa to join Helen's brothers, who had emigrated there. Tragedy struck. Helen arrived in South Africa without her husband. Francis Proust was sick and had to leave the ship before it had even left British waters; he died shortly afterwards. On top of that Helen's eight- month-old daughter, Consuela, was also taken ill and died only days after her arrival in South Africa. Helen, widowed and bereaved, decided to return. At some point after her return to England, in 1854, Helen met Church of England Reverend John Wilkinson Edwards, himself recently widowed with a family of 11 children and in 1856 she accepted his offer of marriage. Helen Macfarlane, the first translator of the Communist Manifesto, became a vicar's wife, at St. Michaels Church, Baddiley in the sleepy, leafy Cheshire parish, just outside Nantwich. Helen gave birth to two boys, Herbert and Walter. She didn't enjoy her quiet life for very long however. In 1860, at age 41, she fell ill with bronchitus and died. She is buried in the churchyard of St. Michaels. The inscription on the gravestone reads: ‚ÄúSacred to the memory of Helen, wife of the Rev. John W Edwards, who fell asleep in Jesus, March the 29th 1860, aged 41 years. So he giveth his beloved sleep‚Äô.‚Äù BBC, Woman With A Past ‚Äì Helen Macfarlane, op. cit. Helen Macfarlane, who fulminated in her writings against the Anglican church (and organised religion generally), died in its embrace. It should be remembered however, that Helen Macfarlane merged Christianity with Communism: ‚ÄúI think one of the most astonishing experiences in the history of humanity was the appearance of the democratic idea in the person of a poor despised Jewish proletarian, the Galilean carpenter‚Äôs son who worked probably at his fathers trade till he was 30 years of age and then began to teach his idea, wrapped in parables and figures to other working men, chiefly fishermen who listened to him while they mended their nets or cast them into the lake of Gennesaret.‚Äù Macfarlane, ‚ÄúDemocracy,‚Äù op. cit. Quoted in BBC, Woman With A Past ‚Äì Helen Macfarlane, op. cit. Helen Macfarlane's writings show an acute knowledge of Chartist affairs and international politics, written in a punchy, at times knockabout style, expressive of proletarian anger. She critiques the factional opponents of the Red Republicans within Chartism, as well as the great literary figures of her day, such as Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens and Alphonse de Lamartine. Her writings are full of literary references (to Homer, Sophocles, Miguel de Cervantes, John Milton, and Heinrich Heine) and show not only a thorough grasp of what was about to become known as Marxism, but also a familiarity with what later Marxists, such as Althusser, tried to \\"drive back into the night,\\" namely the Hegelian dialectic. Black argues that historians of philosophy have ignored her role as the first British commentator on, and translator of, the writing of G.W.F.

Ecology 40% of the reserve is densely planted conifer plantation and 40% is sweet chestnut coppice plantation. The remaining 20% is mixed native deciduous woodland. Nightjars and nightingale are present. Common cow-wheat, the foodplant of the caterpillar of the heath fritillary is already present in some parts of the wood. Conservation West Blean (and Thornden Wood) forms an important part of a wider conservation jigsaw, linking the Blean Woods National Nature Reserve in the west with East Blean Woods in the east, and thereby establishing a continuous nature conservation complex owned and managed by a partnership of bodies including other conservation organisations, statutory bodies and local planning authorities. In the coming years, Kent Wildlife Trust will be working to remove the conifer plantations and restore the ancient woodland habitat and associated species. The Trust will also establish and maintain an annual coppice management programme, which will benefit the nationally rare heath fritillary and white admiral butterflies, and many other species, including bluebell, wood anemone, long- eared owl, yellow necked wood mouse and dormouse. In the even longer term the aim will be to diversify the sweet chestnut coppice by restoring native coppice species such as hazel, hornbeam and oak.

It is part of the Wouldham to Detling Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest and Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I.. It is also in the North Downs Woodlands Special Area of Conservation and the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Description This five-and-a-half hectare site is part of an internationally important yew woodland complex. The steep chalky slopes of the central part of the wood are occupied by a dense stand of yew overtopped in places by mature ash and beech, with some field maple, wild cherry and oak. Some of the beech trees are fine specimens whilst others have died and provide important dead wood habitat for many insects and fungi. A large section in the centre of the reserve was flattened by the October 1987 storm. This area has been left untouched and is monitored to record natural regeneration after this natural disturbance event. On deeper soils in the northern part and in more level areas, hazel and ash coppice occurs. Here oak is more abundant, and crab apple can be found. Diligent search may yield butcher's-broom and green hellebore, whilst at the southern end, is stinking hellebore. There is also a fine colony of stinking iris, its orange seeds persisting through the winter. Down the western edge, a good mixture of shrubs includes burnet rose, guelder- rose, spindle, wayfaring-tree and wild privet. The more common orchids of chalk scrub and woodland are present, mainly in one or two small clearings and at the field margins, but all are scarce. Many common woodland bird species are present including green and great spotted woodpecker, and goldcrest. During October and November flocks of thrushes can be seen feeding on the crop of yew berries.

Map 188) on Common Road, Blue Bell Hill. Bus 101 Maidstone and Chatham/Gillingham stops in Blue Bell Hill village (1/4 mile). The reserve is accessible via a network of public footpaths with parking at two main areas - the KCC Bluebell Hill Picnic Site and roadside parking near the Windmill Pub in Burham. For safety reasons, entry to the two chalk pits within the reserve is by permit only, available from Kent Wildlife Trust. Being on a hillside, some paths are steep and uneven and there are some stiles. Description It is in two parts, totalling 104 hectares. The south-eastern section (excluding the chalk pits) is dominated by woodland and scrub, with two areas totalling approximately 5 hectares, which are managed by grazing using the Trust's own herd of Exmoor ponies. The northern section, which includes Wouldham Common, is also predominantly woodland with some recently cleared areas, now under grazing management. Access to this section is by arrangement only. Woodland and scrub areas have a wide variety of tree and shrub species typical of the chalk soil. This provides an important habitat for dormice and breeding birds including nightingale and hobby. Woodland glades and edges have important populations of lady and fly orchid. Open grassland areas are important for their chalk grassland flora including man and pyramidal orchid, dropwort and thyme. Butterflies include chalkhill blue, brown argus and silver-spotted skipper; the latter was re-introduced to the site in 1998. The Down provides views over the Weald of Kent.

An English and Iroquois force came north from Albany, New York to attack Montreal, but was repulsed with significant casualties by the French and their Indian allies. Background During the summer of 1691 a force led by Major Pieter Schuyler invaded the French settlements along the Richelieu River south of Montreal. Louis-Hector de Calli√®re, the local French governor, responded by massing 700-800 French and allies at the fort at La Prairie, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The battle Schuyler surprised the much larger French force in a rainstorm just before dawn on August 11, inflicting severe casualties before withdrawing towards the Richelieu. Schuyler's force might have remained intact but instead was intercepted by the force of 160 men led by Philippe Cl√©ment du Vuault de la Valrennes that had been detached to block the road to Chambly. The two sides fought in vicious hand-to-hand combat for approximately an hour, before Schuyler's force broke through and escaped. Aftermath The French had suffered the most casualties during Schuyler's initial ambush, but the casualties the Albany force suffered after Valrennes' counterattack meant that they had incurred the greater proportion of loss. Instead of continuing his raids, Schuyler was forced to retreat back to Albany. The battle was also the subject of a 19th-century poem by William Douw Schuyler-Lighthall. In 1921, the site of Valrennes' counterattack was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. NotesReferences \\"The Battle of La Prairie\\", by W.D.

Arriving too late to see any real action, it was however used by both Poland and the Soviet Union in the Polish-Soviet War. Development The A.1 resulted from continued efforts by the Ansaldo company to create a true fighter. Their SVA.5 had proved unsuitable in this role, although it made an excellent reconnaissance aircraft and had been ordered into production as such. Ansaldo engineer Giuseppe Brezzi revised the SVA.5 design, increasing the size of the lower wing, and redesigning the interplane strut arrangement, abandoning the SVA's transverse Warren truss interplane strut layout, which had eliminated the need for spanwise-exposed flying and landing wires, which the new rigging scheme re-introduced to the Balilla's airframe design. While this produced more drag, it increased the stiffness of the wing structure and reduced stresses in the airframe. Engine power was increased to 150 kW (200 hp) and a safety system to jettison the fuel tank through a ventral hatch (in case of onboard fire) was installed. The first prototype was completed in July 1917, but acceptance by the air force did not occur until December. Test pilots were not enthusiastic in their evaluation. While they found a marked increase in performance over the SVA.5, the A.1 was still not as maneuverable as the French-built and designed types in use by Italy's squadrons, most notably the Nieuport 17, which was also produced by Macchi in Italy. This resulted in a number of modifications, including a slight enlargement of the wings and rudder, and a further 10% increase in engine power. This initially proved satisfactory to the air force, and the modified A.1 (designated A.1bis) was ordered into service with 91 Squadriglia for further evaluation. Reports from pilots were mixed. While the fighter's speed was impressive, it proved unmaneuverable and difficult to fly. Nevertheless, with a need to clear a backlog of obsolete fighter types then in service, the air force ordered the A.1 anyway. Operational history Ansaldo A.1 BalillaThe first of an original order of 100 machines entered service in July 1918. The A.1s were kept away from the front lines and mostly assigned to home defence duties. In the four months before the Armistice, A.1s scored only one aerial victory, over an Austrian reconnaissance aircraft. It was during this time that Ansaldo engaged in a number of promotional activities, including dubbing the aircraft as Balilla, flying displays in major Italian cities, and in August donating an example to Italian aviator Antonio Locatelli as his personal property amidst a press spectacle. (This latter publicity stunt backfired somewhat when one week later a mechanical fault in the aircraft caused Locatelli to make a forced landing behind enemy lines and be taken prisoner). Despite all this, the air force ordered another 100 machines, all of which were delivered before the end of the war. At the armistice, 186 were operational, of which 47 aircraft were ordered to remain on hand with training squadrons, and the remainder were to be put into storage. In Polish service The A.1 found a new lease of life, however, when a purchasing committee from the Polish army visited Italy in 1919 in search of new weapons. A contract for ten evaluation aircraft was signed, and these were delivered to Warsaw in January 1920. The initial impression of pilots there (mostly American volunteers) was extremely favourable, on account of its high speed and fuel capacity and, curiously, the maneuverability disdained by Italian airmen. On May 25, the A.1s were deployed to the front line. All but one of them were destroyed during the Red Army counterattack in the Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Polish government had already purchased another 25 aircraft and a licence to locally produce another 100. The new aircraft only arrived after hostilities had ended, and in July 1921 the first of 36 licence-built machines rolled out of the Lublin factory. The Lublin-built machines were some 80 kg (180 lb) heavier than the original Italian design and exhibited frequent problems with their engines and with the quality of their welds. Numerous accidents ensued, including at least nine fatal crashes. In 1924, the production order was reduced to 80 machines, and soon thereafter to 57 (the number actually constructed at the time). The following year, the armament was removed from all A.1s then in service, and by 1927, the type had been withdrawn from service completely. In Soviet service In 1920, the White Russian army ordered thirty aircraft, of which 18 were eventually delivered in April 1922. These were initially deployed in the Kharkov region, flying unarmed (they had been ordered sans weapons). They eventually served around the Baltic and Black Sea until mid-1928. During Winter, they were equipped with skis. In Latvian service In 1921, Latvia became another buyer, ordering 13 aircraft even though the demonstration flight in Riga ended in a fatal crash for Ansaldo's test pilot. The Latvian machines differed from other examples by the addition of insulation to protect the engine from the cold. Promotions in the Americas In an attempt to secure post-war markets, Ansaldo undertook a number of promotional activities in both North and South America. The firm sent six aircraft to the United States in 1919 in an attempt to attract private buyers - at $US 6,000 apiece. The aircraft's high speed proved attractive to record-hunters; US aviation ace Eddie Rickenbacker set a national airspeed record in one in 1920, and one was flown with a Curtiss D-12 engine to third place in the 1921 US Pulitzer air race. Four aircraft were flown on tour to Argentina and then to Uruguay in an attempt to interest the respective governments in the type, Ansaldo even offering each country two of the promotional aircraft with its complements. However, no order ensued from either of them. The company then displayed two aircraft in Peru, and one in Honduras, but without any success there either. With the failure of the South American promotional tour to attract any business, Ansaldo abandoned the A.1, and the firm was soon absorbed into Fiat. Mexico acquired one example in 1920 and served in the Fuerza A√©rea Mexicana for few years.

The castle was built on a hill dominating the area and used to be a stronghold protecting Coimbra in times of Reconquista. Castle of Penela and the neighboring castle Montemor-o-Velho are both fine examples of defensive structures of that period. The origins of the name are controversial and are attributed by some authors to ancient Celtic tribes. According to a local legend, King Afonso I (Afonso Henriques) exclaimed to incite his troops storming the stronghold: Coragem! J√° estamos com o p√© nela! (Courage! We have already set a foot in it!). A more plausible hypothesis is, however, that penela is a diminutive of penha, a place selected to build a fortress on.  History  It is believed that the area was already inhabited before the Roman occupation, and later a Roman watchtower was erected to oversee the nearby road connecting M√©rida, Con√≠mbriga and Braga. There is, however, no strong evidence to support this hypothesis, as well as any possible fortifications built here in times of Muslim occupation of the Iberian Peninsula.  Medieval castle  View from inside the walls Penela's involvement in the Christian Reconquista starts with the conquest of Coimbra region by the troops of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n (Fernando Magno) in 1064. In the next year the already walled settlement was granted a status of town along with four other nearby villages. The testament of count Sesnando Davides (1087), to whom the king delegated the administration of Conimbricense county, affirms that the count ruled the castle of Penela and the people in the area. During the successive Muslim offensives in 1116 and 1117 castles Castelo de Miranda do Corvo and Castelo de Santa Eul√°lia were conquered and destroyed, which caused the desertion of castle Castelo de Soure. These castles provided a line of defence for Coimbra region and now castle Penela was threatened. Perhaps this position was also lost, which would explain king Afonso I Henriques assaulting it in 1129, although this version is not supported by any sources. There are documents attributed to the period when a Chart of Foral was granted to the town, which reference a donation of a house inside the castle dated by 1145. This puts in question the assertion that the castle was conquered in 1148, as it is claimed by historian Frei Ant√≥nio Brand√£o (Monarchia Lusitana, 1632), which is also improbable in context of the Conquest of Santar√©m, and Lisbon since 1147 when the line of Muslim defences was pushed to river Sado. The castle played an important role in later periods. For instance, Afonso IV of Portugal (1325-1357) was born and died here. During the 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis, the alcaide (commander of the castle) count Viana sided with Castile. Once as he left the castle to seek provisions, he was ambushed at the gates by commoners. As the count fell from the hill he was decapitated by one of the commoners, whom chronicler Fern√£o Lopes called Caspirre. Later Pedro duke of Coimbra undertook extensive works in the castle. He ordered a construction of a ducal palace and church S√£o Miguel. Town's gates were rebuilt as well. The town was granted a permission to hold an annual fair (since 1433) on St Michael's Day (September 29). The castle and town later became a county with Afonso Vasconcelos e Meneses as the 1st count of Penela. Later the ownership of the castle was passed to the House of Aveiro.  From the earthquake of 1755 to the present day  By the 18th century the castle had lost its defensive value. The earthquake of 1755 destroyed the donjon tower (Clock Tower) and one of the gates. To rebuild the tower in 1760 the stone from the third gate of the castle was used. In the same century after the death of Jos√© (1750-1777) the ruling family de Aveiro became extinct. By the beginning of the 20th century the old castle was abandoned and ruined. This was brought to the public opinion and in 1910 the castle was proclaimed a National Monument. Starting in 1940-s the castle underwent a series of restoration works under the supervision of General Direction of the Buildings and National Monuments.  Description  The castle built on a granite mountain occupies the area of about ¬Ω hectare (1.23 acre). It has a shape of an irregular polygon adapted to terrain. The architecture is a mixture of Romanesque and International Gothic styles. According to studies the construction of the castle had two important periods: *In the 14th century when a new ring of walls was erected comprising twelve towers, four of which are preserved today. *In the 15th century when the Clock Tower and castelejo were built being the structural evolution of the old donjon tower. One of the gates is still preserved: the Gates of Treason or Fields Gates (the northern).

The exercises were held June 9‚Äì13, 1997 and included participants such as the National Security Agency (which acted as the Red Team), Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Reconnaissance Office, Defense Information Systems Agency, Department of State, Department of Justice, as well as critical civilian infrastructure providers such as power and communication companies. The simulated cyber attack led directly to the formation of the United States Cyber Command. Eligible Receiver 97 featured mock cyber attacks, hostage seizures, and special operations raids that sought to demonstrate potential national security threats that could be posed through the cyber domain. The joint exercise involved a National Security Agency Red Team which played the role of North Korea, Iran, and Cuba attempting to cause critical civilian infrastructural damage, as well as gain control over the militaries command- and-control capabilities. The NSA Red Team used hacker techniques and software that was freely available on the Internet at that time. The Red Team was able to crack networks and do things such as deny services; change and manipulate emails to make them appear to come from a legitimate source; disrupt communications between the National Command Authority, intelligence agencies, and military commands. Common vulnerabilities were exploited which allowed the Red Team to gain root access to over 36 government networks which allowed them to change/add user accounts and reformat server hard drives. The National Security Agency Red Team had no inside information to work with, but by engaging in extensive preliminary electronic reconnaissance of target agencies and sites prior to the attacks, they were able to inflict considerable simulated damage. Although many aspects of Eligible Receiver remain classified, it is known that the Red Team was able to infiltrate and take control of U.S. Pacific Command computer systems as well as power grids and 911 systems in nine major U.S. cities. The mock attack featured three phases. The first two phases were concerned with computer network penetration of civilian infrastructure and military command and control. Recently declassified documents show that the last phase of Eligible Receiver connected cyber attacks to operations in physical domains. Specifically, the mock attack included a hijacking-at-sea of the ship MV National Pride. Documents detailing the last phase of Eligible Receiver remained classified until they were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the nongovernmental National Security Archives at George Washington University.

Often, cultured neuronal networks are connected to an input/output device such as a multi-electrode array (MEA), thus allowing two-way communication between the researcher and the network. This model has proved to be an invaluable tool to scientists studying the underlying principles behind neuronal learning, memory, plasticity, connectivity, and information processing. Cultured neurons are often connected via computer to a real or simulated robotic component, creating a hybrot or animat, respectively. Researchers can then thoroughly study learning and plasticity in a realistic context, where the neuronal networks are able to interact with their environment and receive at least some artificial sensory feedback. One example of this can be seen in the Multielectrode Array Art (MEART) system developed by the Potter Research Group at the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with SymbioticA, The Centre for Excellence in Biological Art, at the University of Western Australia. Another example can be seen in the neurally controlled animat. Use as a model=Advantages The use of cultured neuronal networks as a model for their in vivo counterparts has been an indispensable resource for decades. It allows researchers to investigate neuronal activity in a much more controlled environment than would be possible in a live organism. Through this mechanism researchers have gleaned important information about the mechanisms behind learning and memory. A cultured neuronal network allows researchers to observe neuronal activity from several vantage points. Electrophysiological recording and stimulation can take place either across the network or locally via an MEA, and the network development can be visually observed using microscopy techniques. Moreover, chemical analysis of the neurons and their environment is more easily accomplished than in an in vivo setting. Disadvantages Cultured neuronal networks are by definition disembodied cultures of neurons. Thus by being outside their natural environment, the neurons are influenced in ways that are not biologically normal. Foremost among these abnormalities is the fact that the neurons are usually harvested as neural stem cells from a fetus and are therefore disrupted at a critical stage in network development. When the neurons are suspended in solution and subsequently dispensed, the connections previously made are destroyed and new ones formed. Ultimately, the connectivity (and consequently the functionality) of the tissue is changed from what the original template suggested. Another disadvantage lies in the fact that the cultured neurons lack a body and are thus severed from sensory input as well as the ability to express behavior ‚Äì a crucial characteristic in learning and memory experiments. It is believed that such sensory deprivation has adverse effects on the development of these cultures and may result in abnormal patterns of behavior throughout the network. Cultured networks on traditional MEAs are flat, single-layer sheets of cells with connectivity only two dimensions. Most in vivo neuronal systems, to the contrary, are large three-dimensional structures with much greater interconnectivity. This remains one of the most striking differences between the model and the reality, and this fact probably plays a large role in skewing some of the conclusions derived from experiments based on this model. Growing a neuronal network=Neurons used Because of their wide availability, neuronal networks are typically cultured from dissociated rat neurons. Studies commonly employ rat cortical, hippocampal, and spinal neurons, although lab mouse neurons have also been used. Currently, relatively little research has been conducted on growing primate or other animal neuronal networks. Harvesting neural stem cells requires sacrificing the developing fetus, a process considered too costly to perform on many mammals that are valuable in other studies. One study, however, did make use of human neural stem cells grown into a network to control a robotic actuator. These cells were acquired from a fetus that spontaneously aborted after ten weeks in gestation. Long-term culture One of the most formidable problems associated with cultured neuronal networks is their lack of longevity. Like most cell cultures, neuron cultures are highly susceptible to infection. They are also susceptible to hyperosmolality from medium evaporation. The long timelines associated with studying neuronal plasticity (usually on the scale of months) makes extending the lifespan of neurons in vitro paramount. One solution to this problem involves growing cells on an MEA inside a sealed chamber. This chamber serves as a non-humidified incubator that is enclosed by a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membrane that is permeable to select gases (i.e. gases necessary for metabolism) but impermeable to water and microbes. Other solutions entail an incubator with an impermeable membrane that has a specific mix of gases (air with 5% CO2 is typical) sealed inside. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) A microelectrode array (MEA), also commonly called a multielectrode array, is a patterned array of electrodes laid out in a transparent substrate used for communication with neurons in contact with it. The communication can be, and usually is, bidirectional; researchers can both record electrophysiological data from a live network and stimulate it. This device has been an essential biosensor for more than thirty years. It has been used not only in the study of neuronal plasticity and information processing but also in drug and toxin effects on neurons. Additionally, when coupled with a sealed incubation chamber this device greatly reduces the risk of culture contamination by nearly eliminating the need to expose it to air. Currently, commonly used MEAs have relatively poor spatial resolution. They employ approximately sixty electrodes for recording and stimulation in varying patterns in a dish with a typical culture of 50,000 cells or more (or a density of 5,000 cells/mm2). It follows that each electrode in the array services a large cluster of neurons and cannot provide resolute information regarding signal origin and destination; such MEAs are only capable of region-specific data acquisition and stimulation. Ideally it would be possible to record and stimulate from a single or a few neurons at a time. Indeed, companies such as Axion Biosystems are working to provide MEAs with much higher spatial resolution to this end (a maximum of 768 input/output electrodes). Another study investigates establishing a stable one-to-one connection between neurons and electrodes. The goal was to meet the ideal interface situation by establishing a correspondence with every neuron in the network. They do so by caging individual neurons while still allowing the axons and dendrites to extend and make connections. Neurons are contained within neurocages or other sorts of containers, and the device itself could be referred to as the caged neuron MEA or neurochip. Other research suggests alternative techniques to stimulating neurons in vitro. One study investigates the use of a laser beam to free caged compounds such as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. A laser beam with wavelength in the UV spectrum would have extremely high spatial accuracy and, by releasing the caged compounds, could be used to influence a very select set of neurons. Network behavior=Spontaneous network activity Spontaneous network bursts are a commonplace feature of neuronal networks both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, this activity is particularly important in studies on learning and plasticity. Such experiments look intensely at the network-wide activity both before and after experiments in order to discern any changes that might implicate plasticity or even learning. However, confounding this experimental technique is the fact that normal neuronal development induces change in array-wide bursts that could easily skew data. In vivo, however, it has been suggested that these network bursts may form the basis for memories. Depending on experimental perspective, network-wide bursts can be viewed either positively or negatively. In a pathological sense, spontaneous network activity can be attributed to the disembodiment of the neurons; one study saw a marked difference between array-wide firing frequency in cultures that received continuous input versus those that did not. To eliminate aberrant activity, researchers commonly use magnesium or synaptic blockers to quiet the network. However, this approach has great costs; quieted networks have little capacity for plasticity due to a diminished ability to create action potentials. A different and perhaps more effective approach is the use of low frequency stimulation that emulates sensory background activity. In a different light, network bursts can be thought of as benign and even good. Any given network demonstrates non-random, structured bursts. Some studies have suggested that these bursts represent information carriers, expression of memory, a means for the network to form appropriate connections, and learning when their pattern changes. =Array-wide burst stability= Stegenga et al. set out to establish the stability of spontaneous network bursts as a function of time. They saw bursts throughout the lifetime of the cell cultures, beginning at 4‚Äì7 days in vitro (DIV) and continuing until culture death. They gathered network burst profiles (BPs) through a mathematical observation of array-wide spiking rate (AWSR), which is the summation of action potentials over all electrodes in an MEA. This analysis yielded the conclusion that, in their culture of Wistar rat neocortical cells, the AWSR has long rise and fall times during early development and sharper, more intense profiles after approximately 25 DIV. However, the use of BPs has an inherent shortcoming; BPs are an average of all network activity over time, and therefore only contain temporal information. In order to attain data about the spatial pattern of network activity they developed what they call phase profiles (PPs), which contain electrode specific data. Data was gathered using these PPs on timescales of milliseconds up through days. Their goal was to establish the stability of network burst profiles on the timescale of minutes to hours and to establish stability or developmental changes over the course of days. In summary, they were successful in demonstrating stability over minutes to hours, but the PPs gathered over the course of days displayed significant variability. These finding imply that studies of plasticity of neurons can only be conducted over the course of minutes or hours without bias in network activity introduced by normal development. Learning vs. plasticity There is much controversy in the field of neuroscience surrounding whether or not a cultured neuronal network can learn. A crucial step in finding the answer to this problem lies in establishing the difference between learning and plasticity. One definition suggests that learning is \\"the acquisition of novel behavior through experience\\". Corollary to this argument is the necessity for interaction with the environment around it, something that cultured neurons are virtually incapable of without sensory systems. Plasticity, on the other hand, is simply the reshaping of an existing network by changing connections between neurons: formation and elimination of synapses or extension and retraction of neurites and dendritic spines. But these two definitions are not mutually exclusive; in order for learning to take place, plasticity must also take place. In order to establish learning in a cultured network, researchers have attempted to re- embody the dissociated neuronal networks in either simulated or real environments (see MEART and animat). Through this method the networks are able to interact with their environment and, therefore, have the opportunity to learn in a more realistic setting. Other studies have attempted to imprint signal patterns onto the networks via artificial stimulation. This can be done by inducing network bursts or by inputting specific patterns to the neurons, from which the network is expected to derive some meaning (as in experiments with animats, where an arbitrary signal to the network indicates that the simulated animal has run into a wall or is moving in a direction, etc.). The latter technique attempts to take advantage of the inherent ability of neuronal networks to make sense of patterns. However, experiments have had limited success in demonstrating a definition of learning that is widely agreed upon. Nevertheless, plasticity in neuronal networks is a phenomenon that is well-established in the neuroscience community, and one that is thought to play a very large role in learning.

It is a part of the greater Behala region and can be reached via Chowrasta or through Barisha. It is a predominantly Bengali neighborhood, though its fast becoming a cosmopolitan place. It is bordered by Barisha in the east and Shakuntala Park to the west. History Behala was once a part of the Sunderbans. The history of Barisha dated back to the Pala Era. In the 12th century, Barisha was a small village of farmers, fishermen and honey-gathers when a Kulin Kayastha named Dhananjay Mitra settled here. During the reign of Akbar Barisha came under the lordship of Basanta Roy who set up his capital at modern-day Sarsuna. Roy‚Äôs nephew and the king of Jessore Pratapaditya murdered him and incorporated Barisha with his kingdom. After the Mughals defeated Pratapaditya, Laksmikanta Majumdar of the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family was given jagirdari of a vast tract of land by Raja Man Singh in 1608. The three villages of Sutanuti, Govindapur and Kalikata were part of a khasmahal or imperial jagir or an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor himself, whose jagirdari rights were held by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family. Even the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family was not keen to allow the British to settle or do trading on these villages, but the British had paid a bribe at the Mughal Durbar to ensure that the deal did not fail. Just prior to their move to Barisha, the Roy Choudhury family had to transfer their rights over Kalikata in 1698, to the East India Company much against their wishes and protests. Sabarna Atchala The stretch of Diamond Harbour Road from Taratala to Thakurpukur is a very old settlement, which divides the Behala into three parts - East Behala, South Behala and West Behala. It is populated mostly by citizens of East-Bengal (Before Partition of India Bangladesh was called East Bengal) though traditionally it was primarily a West-Bengali ('ghoti' in Bengali) settlement. Settlement in the area dates back to the 1797, but its urbanization is relatively recent. Population growth started in Behala after the partition of India. The Sabarna Roychoudhury's 'Aath-chala' could be regarded as the most prominent historical structure (though mostly ruined presently) of the city of Kolkata. It is the structure, sitting under which the British East India Company signed the rights of the villages- Kalikata, Gobindapur and Sutanuti (which later merged to form the city of Calcutta), under a lease from the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family on 10 November 1698. It is an area that was extremely rural prior to the 1972 Bangladesh war. During the war, scores of refugees from Bangladesh settled in this area. These refugees who became legal Indian citizens and form the bulk of the population in Sarsuna. Geography=Police district Sarsuna police station is part of the South West division of Kolkata Police.

It was directed by Joseph Hardy, with screenwriter Sherman Yellen and music by Maurice Jarre, starring Michael York as Pip, Simon Gipps-Kent as Young Pip and Sarah Miles as Estella. The production, for Transcontinental Films and ITC, was made for US television and released to cinemas in the UK. It broke with tradition by having the same actress (the thirty-three-year-old Sarah Miles) play both the younger and older Estella. The film was shot by Freddie Young. It was filmed in Eastmancolor and it was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival in 1975.

In 1995, Michael York said \\"we found when we started putting it together [that] the songs interrupted the narrative flow of the piece\\".Brian McFarlane (ed), An Autobiography of British Cinema, 1997, p.619 Critics' comments were generally negative. The Listener: \\"Everything is wrong about it with a sort of dedicated, inspired wrongness that, in itself, is breath-taking\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin thought director Hardy and screenwriter Yellen had reduced \\"one of Dickens' most subtle and complex novels to an insipid seasonal confection\\".December 1975, Monthly Film Bulletin Gordon Gow, writing in Films and Filming thought it odd to have \\"Pip divided between two players, [while] his beloved Estella should be played by one actress the whole way through\\".Gow, p. 36, Films and Filming, March 1976 Brian McFarlane, writing in a 2008 study of screen adaptations of Great Expectations, criticised the film for its tendency to give way to \\"clich√©s of sentimentality\\" and assured the director, who had expressed a hope that people would not feel the necessity of comparing it with David Lean's version that, \\"he need not have worried: no one would have spoken of them in the same breath. It's not just Lean's film with which it would not stand comparison but with several superior TV mini-series too\\". McFarlane expressed some admiration however for Margaret Leighton's interpretation of the jilted Miss Havisham: \\"there is a potent sense of the perverse pleasure she takes in watching Estella humiliate Pip, and, during a later visit, of real cruelty in her telling him, 'You've lost her'. Leighton injected 'a necessary bitterness into these scenes.McFarlane, Screen Adaptations, \\"Great Expectations\\", p. 102 The critic David Parker, writing for the BFI Screenonline website, praised Joss Ackland's interpretation of Joe Gargery: \\"Ackland manages to create a subtle blend of individual simplicity and moral fortitude that seems to capture the essential role the village blacksmith fills in the narrative.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1974 films Category:1974 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:English-language films Category:Films based on Great Expectations ","title":"Great Expectations (1974 film)"},{"id":"10839419","text":"Changning may refer to: *Changning (prince) (1657‚Äì1703) was a prince of the Qing Dynasty.

Davis (T-AGOR-5), was one of nine Conrad class oceanographic ships built for the United States Navy (USN), that later saw service in the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). Serving with the USN from 1963 to 1970, these ships were designed to perform acoustic experiments on sound transmission underwater, and for gravity, magnetism and deep-ocean floor studies. The ship was recommissioned into the RNZN in late 1970, and as HMNZS Tui served as an oceanographic survey and research ship until her decommissioning in 1997. In 1999, the ship was scuttled as a dive wreck.  Construction  The fourth ship to be so named by the Navy, Charles H. Davis (T-AGOR-5) was laid down by Christy Corporation, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, 30 June 1962; launched 30 June 1962; sponsored by Mrs. Roy Alexander Gano, wife of Admiral Roy Alexander Gano, Commander MSTS; delivered to the Navy 25 January 1963 and turned over to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) 25 January 1963.  Operational history = USN  RNZN  In 1970, she was transferred to the RNZN, and was commissioned on 11 September 1970 as HMNZS Tui. Tui was named after the Tui bird, and was the second of two ships with this name to serve in the RNZN. After a partial refit and the installation and testing of scientific equipment, Tui began a program of work for the Defence Scientific Establishment in Auckland. For years Tui went unobtrusively about the kind of work she was designed for, primarily underwater acoustics. Tui worked in Australian, Indian Ocean and South Pacific waters. She worked on Auckland University research, with DSIR scientists, and with other oceanographic ships. Tui also took part in several American research programs. Her acoustic research was mainly to do with the detection and tracking of submarines. During the 1970s she made an extensive search for the Maria Theresa Reef.  Decommissioning and fate  In 1997, Tui was decommissioned and was replaced by the hydrographic ship HMNZS Resolution. In February 1999, Tui was scuttled from Tutukaka Heads to serve as a tourist attraction and wreck for divers, following a period of work on her which removed any objects in danger of breaking free and welding shut any areas that may have posed a hazard for wreck divers.Dive Waikato / Tui retrieved on 9 January 2008 Her anchor was presented to the City of Napier.HMNZS Tui Anchor  See also  * Survey ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy  Notes  References  * McDougall, R J (1989) New Zealand Naval Vessels.

She was built by shipbuilder Donald McPhee for the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company, which was a partnership held by Nick Clarke and Russell Peden of the South Fort George town-site of Fort George. Chilcotin was the largest of the company's three sternwheelers and was intended to run as competition against the BC Express Company's new luxury sternwheeler, . Chilcotin had main, promenade and Texas decks, hot and cold running water and stateroom accommodation for fifty. She was built at Soda Creek in late 1909 and early 1910, downstream from where the BC Express Company were building BX. A friendly rivalry quickly developed between the two construction camps and as soon as Chilcotins builders learned that BX was going to be wider than Chilcotin, they teased the workers from the other camp, saying that BX would never fit through the narrow channels of the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons and called her the \\"White Elephant\\". This rumor spread far past the town of Soda Creek and soon the employees of the BC Express Company found themselves being consoled by their friends and associates for \\"having built a dud\\". However, BX proved to be a far superior craft and Chilcotin, was never much competition to her. Chilcotin and Fort Fraser at South Fort George Chilcotin was launched on July 20, 1910 and was put under the command of Captain Arthur Francis Dogherty. She made her first trip up to Fort George that August, but on the return trip to Soda Creek, she had an accident in the Fort George Canyon and had to be taken back to South Fort George. The vessel was laid up at South Fort George for the rest of the season. In 1911, Chilcotin was overhauled and put under the command of DA Foster, who was also the captain of the sternwheeler . That season she would make several trips up the Fraser to Giscome Portage and the Grand Canyon of the Fraser as well as working on the Soda Creek to Fort George route. However, unlike BX which could run this route on a twice-weekly basis, Chilcotin could only advertise a weekly service. Chilcotin worked on the upper Fraser until 1914, when, with the depressed economic conditions caused by World War I and the halting of the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, her owners decided to retire her.

In addition to Clegg, Mchunu, and other regular Juluka band members, the album features studio musicians including Colin Pratley of the South African progressive rock band Freedom's Children and jazz artists Mervyn Africa and Sipho Gumede. Juluka's early albums did not receive much airplay from the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) at the time because the racially mixed band and fusion of Western and African music were contrary to the country's apartheid policy at the time. However the album's release coincided with the launch of Capital Radio 604, the station which broke the SABC's monopoly.

E. Peet, The Mayer Papyri A & B, London 1920 (Nos. M. 11162 and M. 11186) Papyrus Mayer A The best known of the two is Papyrus Mayer A. It deals with court sessions held in the first two years of the Whm Mswt or Renaissance, an era which began in year 19 of king Ramesses XI. A panel consisting of the vizier of the South and three high officials cross-examined suspects charged with tomb robbery at Deir el-Bahri (cf. also the Abbott Papyrus and the Amherst Papyrus). The interrogation of both suspects and witnesses was preceded by a bastinado and an oath in the name of the king was administered. The confessions of the six suspects were corroborated by the testimony of the chief of police of the Theban Necropolis and other witnesses, among them the son of one of the thieves who had died in the meantime. This witness claims to have been a child at the time of the crime; still, he was beaten when he was being examined, as was a female witness. While the ancient Egyptian judicial system was quite brutal and biased against the accused, a verdict of guilty was not a foregone conclusion: Papyrus Mayer A records the discharge of five men who had been found to be innocent. Papyrus Mayer B Papyrus Mayer B is a papyrus fragment, only inscribed on the recto. It consists of 14 preserved horizontal lines of hieratic script, in a form typical of the Twentieth Dynasty.Peet, o.c., 19 Both its beginning and end are incomplete.

Life He was born into a family of minor Bolognese nobility. In 1572 he graduated in Philosophy and Medicine (what would now be called Natural Sciences). His father Pietro Maria Baldi was a lecturer at the University of Bologna and Camillo followed in his footsteps teaching there for sixty years. He started teaching in 1576, teaching Aristotelian logic until 1579 when he was promoted to a junior lectureship in philosophy which he held till 1586. From 1586 to 1590 he held the post of 'Protologicus'. This was a position that seems to have been created specifically for Baldi and little is known about what it involved. He was then made a senior lecturer in Philosophy from 1590 till his death in 1637. In this role he would have lectured on six works of natural philosophy by Aristotle, one per year in a six-year cycle. In his sixty-year career at the University Baldi merited three memorials from his students (two painted on the walls of the lecture hall and one statue in the courtyard). It is almost unheard of for lecturers to get so much praise, so it is clear he was a popular teacher. He also held many roles within the University hierarchy, including that of 'Decano' (Dean) and 'Procancelliere'. He was also curator of the Aldrovandi museum from 1620 till his death in 1637. One of Baldi's students was the poet Alessandro Tassoni. Baldi is mentioned in several of Tassoni's published letters.A Tassoni Lettere, edited by Pietro Puliatti, Bari, 1978. In Tassoni's famous poem La Secchia rapita Baldi is introduced as the ambassador of the Bolognese to Modena, the Modenese having stolen a symbolic bucket from Bologna, Baldi is sent to negotiate for its return. The earliest work of Graphology Baldi left behind numerous printed and manuscript works covering a wide range of subjects. The best known is his essay on graphology, Trattato Come Da Una Lettera Missiva Si Conoscano La Natura E Qualit√† Dello ScrittorePublished by Girolamo Vaschieri, Carpi 1622. which represents the first detailed investigation of the subject. It was first published in 1622 when Baldi was over 70 years old, and Italian editions were also published in 1625,Published by Giovanni Battista Bidelli, Milan. 1983Published by Societa Italiana di Grafologia 'Camillo Baldi', Bologna. Edited by Aurelio Valletta. This edition includes a reproduction of the 1622 edition. and 1992Published by Edizioni Studio Tesi, Pordenone.

Baldi, Camillo (Author) L√≥pez Contreras, Javier (Translator: French To Spanish) Tratado para conocer con una misiva la naturaleza y cualidad del escritor. Ed. Graphicae. Madrid: 2016. It is firmly rooted in the lively tradition of vernacular letter-writing manuals of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in Italy. It is heavily indebted to the classical Greek work De elocutione (On style) attributed to Demetrius Phalereus. Baldi is following Demetrius when he condemns those whose style is too artificial, for, he says such people reveal nothing of themselves, all that one can tell of them is that they are shrewd and artificial. He goes on to say: 'when they are written without artifice or erudition or any consideration at all, but only as his nature dictates to him, then one can probably tell many things about the writer'. Baldi only devotes a few pages (18-21) to considerations of handwriting but it is on this that his fame (such as it is) rests. His interpretations of handwriting are interesting but have little connection to modern theories of graphology. For instance: 'if the writing is both fast, even and well-formed, and appears to have been written with pleasure, it has probably been written by a man who knows nothing and is worthless, because you rarely find intelligent and prudent men who write neatly... these writers are also often cold, avaricious, foolish, intemperate and indiscreet'. On the other hand, he talks of writing that is 'unbecoming, crooked, badly formed and quick, yet legible'. Such writing denotes a mature man who has written a lot. Later he says 'if the handwriting is uneven, with lines that are wavy and generally ascending, such a person is naturally inclined to dominate... with such instability one can also add that he is likely to be choleric and apt to be unrestrained in following his desires'. Other works *In physiognomica Aristotelis commentarii.Bologna, 1621, pp562, fol., edited and translated by Javier Soage (Trier, 2020) This is a very long commentary on the very short pseudo-Aristotelian work on physiognomy.

This work was published several times and is the most widely available of Baldi's Italian works. It is on the subject of duelling and more specifically on how to avoid becoming involved in a duel. *De naturali ex unguium inspectione praesagio commentariusBologna, Haered.

The storm hit the city of Saskatoon severely and is considered to be one of the worst storms in Saskatchewan's history. It brought motor vehicle traffic to a standstill, stranded people and shut down many public services. There were two fatalities from the storm. Blizzard conditions shut down airports in Prince Albert and Saskatoon. Road conditions were poor during the storm, and highways around Saskatoon, North Battleford, Melfort and Wynyard were closed. Unionized highway snowplow operators, who had been on strike at the time, returned to work in the interest of public safety. City streets in Saskatoon were also clogged with snow, slowing traffic. Some roads in the city's outer periphery were impassable due to high drifts. 14 major intersections were closed or deemed impassable. All branches of Saskatoon's public library closed in the afternoon as did city leisure facilities, indoor skating rinks and public schools. Several businesses allowed their employees to go home early, while the University of Saskatchewan shut down along with SIAST Kelsey campus and government agencies. Hotels were filled with stranded travellers and city residents who could not drive home because of the inclement conditions. Some people resorted to taking refuge overnight in businesses such as Costco. Emergency services spent the day responding to accidents, rescuing stranded motorists from stuck vehicles, and closing roads. SaskTel's cellular telephone network was overloaded with calls, prompting the Saskatoon fire department to urge the public to refrain from using mobile phones in all but emergency situations. Aftermath Two people died in the storm. An 18-year-old man and 38-year-old woman, both from the Onion Lake Cree Nation, were caught in the blizzard and died from hypothermia after attempting to walk home from their vehicle. Total cost of the cleanup was approximately $1 million. Records Whiteout, accumulation, and snowdrift from the blizzard, as seen through an open door.

Vosburgh was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He persuaded his father to let him study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (where he met his future wife, Beryl Roques) and won the Comedy Acting prize. He was soon writing for BBC Radio, starting with scripts for Bernard Braden in 1953. Often partnering with other writers including Garry Chambers and Barry Cryer he wrote television shows for Ronnie Corbett, David Frost, Roy Hudd, Bobby Davro, Frankie Howerd, Bob Monkhouse, Lenny Henry, Tommy Cooper, Freddie Starr and Bob Hope and material for the radio revival of the Marx Brothers show Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel. He also helped write the scripts for the films Up Pompeii, Up the Chastity Belt, Carry On Nurse and Call Me Bwana and the TV sitcom Tell It to the Marines. According to legend, he did much of his writing while continuously riding the Circle Line of the London Underground to avoid interruptions. In the late 1960s, he appeared in How To Irritate People and various early episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus. In 1962, he voiced Larry Dart in the children's television show Space Patrol. As a lyricist, he had a reputation for being meticulous about the use of words and rhymes, and having a huge knowledge of the Broadway classics. He wrote the pastiche A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine with composer Frank Lazarus (1979), Windy City (with Tony Macaulay, based on The Front Page, 1982) and A Saint She Ain‚Äôt (with Denis King, 1999).

Pap test. Pap stain. Cytopathic effect or cytopathogenic effect (abbreviated CPE) refers to structural changes in host cells that are caused by viral invasion. The infecting virus causes lysis of the host cell or when the cell dies without lysis due to an inability to reproduce. Both of these effects occur due to CPEs. If a virus causes these morphological changes in the host cell, it is said to be cytopathogenic. Common examples of CPE include rounding of the infected cell, fusion with adjacent cells to form syncytia, and the appearance of nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. CPEs and other changes in cell morphology are only a few of the many effects by cytocidal viruses. When a cytocidal virus infects a permissive cell, the viruses kill the host cell through changes in cell morphology, in cell physiology, and the biosynthetic events that follow. These changes are necessary for efficient virus replication but at the expense of the host cell. Diagnostics CPEs are important aspects of a viral infection in diagnostics. Many CPEs can be seen in unfixed, unstained cells under the low power of an optical microscope, with the condenser down and the iris diaphragm partly closed. However, with some CPEs, namely inclusion bodies, the cells must be fixed and stained then viewed under light microscopy. Some viruses' CPEs are characteristic and therefore can be an important tool for virologists in diagnosing an infected animal or human. The rate of CPE appearance is also an important characteristic that virologists may use to identify virus type. If CPE appears after 4 to 5 days in vitro at low multiplicity of infection, then the virus is considered slow. If the CPE appears after 1 to 2 days in vitro at low multiplicity of infection, then the virus is thought to be rapid. Inoculations always occur at low multiplicity of infection because at high multiplicity of infection, all CPEs occur rapidly. Typically, the first sign of viral infections is the rounding of cells. Inclusion bodies often then appear in the cell nucleus and/or cytoplasm of the host cell. The inclusion bodies can first be identified by light microscopy in patient blood smears or stained sections of infected tissues. However, to fully characterize their composition, electron microscopy must be performed. Inclusion bodies may either be accumulation of virus replication byproducts or altered host cell organelles or structures. Some viral infections cause a strange CPE, the formation of syncytia. Syncytia are large cytoplasmic masses that contain many nuclei. They are typically produced by fusion of infected cells. This mechanism is useful to the virus as it allows the virus to spread from infected to uninfected cells. Viral infections may have clinically relevant phenotypical CPEs. For example, with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), liver steatosis is characteristic enough of the virus that it may be used to help identify the genotype, the genetic composition of the virus. HCV genotype 3 patients are significantly more likely to develop liver steatosis than those with genotype 1. Also, CPEs may be used during research to determine the efficacy of a new drug. An assay has been developed that screens the dengue virus's CPEs in order to assess cell viability. Due to the host cell specificity of CPEs, researchers can also use them to test any discrepancies in an experiment. For many viral infections, different host cell strains may have a characteristic response. Currently, there are many concerns within the research community about the validity and purity of cell strains. Contamination has risen within and among laboratories. CPEs can be used to test the purity of a certain cell line. For example, HeLa CCL-2 is a common cell line used in a wide variety of research areas. To test the purity of the HeLa cells, CPEs were observed that occurred after inoculation with Coxsackievirus B3. These CPEs included morphology changes and cell morbidity rates. Carson et al. determined that the discrepancy is due to the heterogeneous nature of the commercial HeLa cells as compared to the homogeneous nature of HeLa cells that have been propagated for generations in a lab. Common types=Total destruction Total destruction of the host cell monolayer is the most severe type of CPE. To observe this process, cells are seeded on a glass surface and a confluent monolayer of host cell is formed. Then, the viral infection is introduced. All cells in the monolayer shrink rapidly, become dense in a process known as pyknosis, and detach from the glass within three days. This form of CPE is typically seen with enteroviruses. Subtotal destruction Subtotal destruction of the host cell monolayer is less severe than total destruction. Similarly to total destruction, this CPE is observed by seeding a confluent monolayer of host cell on a glass surface then introducing a viral infection. Subtotal destruction characteristically shows detachment of some but not all the cells in the monolayer. It is commonly observed with some togaviruses, some picornaviruses, and some types of paramyxoviruses. Focal degeneration Focal degeneration causes a localized attack of the host cell monolayer. Although this type of CPE may eventually affect the entire tissue, the initial stages and spreading occur at localized viral centers known as foci. Focal degeneration is due to direct cell-to-cell transfer of the virus rather than diffusion through the extracellular medium. This different mode of transfer differentiates it from total and subtotal destruction and causes the characteristic localized effects. Initially, host cells become enlarged, rounded, and refractile. Eventually, the host cells detach from the surface. The spreading of the virus occurs concentrically, so that the cells lifting off are surrounded by enlarged, rounded cells that are surrounded by healthy tissue. This type of CPE is characteristic of herpesviruses and poxviruses. Swelling and clumping Swelling and clumping is a CPE where host cells swell significantly. Once enlarged, the cells clump together in clusters. Eventually, the cells become so large that they detach. This type of CPE is characteristic of adenoviruses. Foamy degeneration Foamy degeneration is also known as vacuolization. It is due to the formation of large and/or numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles. This type of CPE can only be observed with fixation and staining of the host cells involved. Foamy degeneration is characteristic of certain retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, and flaviviruses. Syncytium Syncytium is also known as cell fusion and polykaryon formation. With this CPE, the plasma membranes of four or more host cells fuse and produce an enlarged cell with at least four nuclei. Although large cell fusions are sometimes visible without staining, this type of CPE is typically detected after host cell fixation and staining. Herpesviruses characteristically produce cell fusion as well as other forms of CPE. Some paramyxoviruses may be identified through the formation of cell fusion as they exclusively produce this CPE. Inclusion bodies Inclusion bodies ‚Äì insoluble abnormal structures within cell nuclei or cytoplasm ‚Äì may only be seen with staining as they indicate areas of altered staining in the host cells. Typically, they indicate the areas of the host cell where viral protein or nucleic acid is being synthesized or where virions are being assembled. Also, in some cases, inclusion bodies are present without an active virus and indicate areas of viral scarring. Inclusion bodies vary with viral strain. They may be single or multiple, small or large, and round or irregularly shaped. They may also be intranuclear or intracytoplasmic and eosinophilic or basophilic.

Retrieved on September 1, 2018. Pages: 1 and 2. It was founded in the Washington, D.C., metro area by Robert Haft in 1977. Crown Books (retail) is of no relation to Crown Books (publisher), although the former carried inventory from the latter. Founding and growth Crown Books was founded in the Washington, D.C., metro area in 1977 by Robert Haft with money borrowed from his father, D.C. businessman Herbert Haft. The chain was organized under the umbrella of the Dart Group (not related to the current UK-based Dart Group), which also included Trak Auto, Shoppers Food Warehouse, Total Beverage, Dart Drug, and Combined Properties. Known for low prices, the chain gained fame in the 1980s and early 1990s for its clever advertising campaigns (such as Robert Haft sitting on large stacks of books with the caption \\"Books Cost Too Much, That's Why I Opened Crown Books. Now You'll Never Pay Full Price Again!\\") At the beginning, Crown Books day-to-day operations were managed by Jose Gonzales (Vice President of Operations) and Jeanne Herrick (Vice President of Merchandising). Once the decision was made to expand into other areas the dynamic of Mr. Gonzales & Ms. Herrick was replicated into the California Market with the addition of Steve Young & Miriam Bass. Later Crown made the decision to enter the Chicago Market and that entry was managed by Richard Lowe & Rhonda Branch. Crown Books grew rapidly, from its single store in 1977 to a regional chain of 196 stores at its height in 1993, close on the heels of Borders and poised to become the nation's second-largest book chain. While Classic Crown Books stores, which afforded customers between 2,000 and of book selection, had been the backbone of the company since its founding in 1977, they were gradually phased out in favor of the larger, more competitive, superstore format adopted by the company in 1990. Stocking up to 80,000 titles‚Äî10 times the number carried in Classic Crown stores‚ÄîSuper Crown Books locations supplemented the Classic Crown holdings with a large line of greeting cards, games, computer software, and an assortment of gift items. Each superstore provided between 12,000 and of retail space. Robert Haft showed great foresight in planning Crown Software in 1986, but his side projects made him late to the superstore scene which competitors Barnes & Noble and Borders had begun. In 1993, the company was the third largest book chain in the United States, after Barnes & Noble and Borders, and had stores in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, Seattle and Portland. With the advent of its Super Crown Books locations, as well as the boom in sales volume of competitors like Borders, Barnes & Noble, and Books-a-Million, the company reevaluated its Classic Crown locations and determined that several of the smaller stores would become increasingly unprofitable as the trend toward larger bookstores continued. In 1993, under the guidance of Glenn E. Hemmerle, president and CEO of the company from October 1992 through June 1994, Crown prepared the financial groundwork for closing several of its smaller stores. Haft family feud A bitter divorce between Herbert Haft and his wife tore the family apart, and pitted Crown Books founder Robert Haft against his father. When Herbert tried to replace Robert as the head of Crown Books, the situation exploded and their back-and-forth exploits regularly made the front page of The Washington Post over the months between the fall of 1993 and the summer of 1994, becoming a regional media sensation. After Robert's firing, upper management positions were abandoned and refilled with some regularity, draining the company of both management skills and cash. The family feud playing out among Haft family members appeared close to resolution by May 1994. However, four months later a jury awarded Robert M. Haft $34.1 million in compensation for a breach of contract by Dart Group and Crown Books. Several lawsuits and countersuits were filed by other members of the Haft family as each jockeyed for a controlling interest in family-controlled companies. By 1996 Crown found itself listed as co-plaintiff in a lawsuit brought against Herbert H. Haft by the Dart Group charging fraud and breach of fiduciary duty with regard to business transactions made during the course of Haft's divorce and resulting power struggle. Crown had been named as a co- defendant in similar lawsuits filed by shareholder groups as early as 1993. A standstill rider was entered in Delaware court in 1995, restricting certain relevant actions of the Dart Corporation until such time as all legal matters were resolved; by mid-1997 a conditional settlement had been reached with Herbert H. Haft whereby Haft would relinquish his position and voting rights in the Dart Group in exchange for approximately $41 million. Bankruptcy With the dissolution of the Dart Group, Crown was unable to find a buyer and was forced into bankruptcy. After being hired to replace Jeanne Herrick as Vice President of Merchandising, Steve Stevens (Circuit City) replaced Glenn E. Hemmerle in the CEO seat. Over the next few years, the chain began to close over half of its 196 stores and pulled out of Houston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Portland, and Sacramento markets. It reorganized with help from Ingram Content Group, which provided jobbing services to the crippled giant. Crown emerged briefly from bankruptcy in 1997 only to fall back into it in 1998 under leadership of CEO Anna Currence, strangled by lack of financing and stores too small to compete with the superstores of the competition (of the 56 remaining Crown Books stores after the first bankruptcy, only one had a drink bar, an ominous sign of Crown's out-of-touch management in the retail book marketplace). Crown emerged briefly from the second bankruptcy in the spring of 2000 with former Waldenbooks CEO Charlie Cumello in the CEO seat, financed by private funding. In the fall of 2000, the company's debt was purchased by Wells Fargo, which hounded the reemerging brand with collection fees until it eventually broke. In February 2001, Crown Books filed for liquidation, and in April 2001, ten of the D.C.-area stores and eight Chicago stores were purchased by Books-A-Million for pennies on the dollar. The liquidation of the remaining Crown Books stores was completed by July 2001, when a former Palo Alto, California, flagship store was shuttered. The aftermath After Crown Books' bankruptcy in 2001, Andy Weiss, owner of a private bookseller called A&S; Booksellers, bought the Crown Books name and trademark and applied the name to most of his stores. In 2007, Ward Albright purchased the right to share the name with Weiss and opened more bookstores under the Crown Books name. The present Crown Books chain buys remaindered books and overstock in bulk from publishers at large discounts and passes the discounts to customers. Books-A-Million closed one of the DC-area former Crown stores shortly after purchase, but remodeled the remaining 17 stores in 2001 and 2002, and hired on many of the former Crown Books staff. After Crown Books, Anna Currence became an executive recruiter with Sarasota, Florida-based Brooke Chase Associates Inc.

WOSF is the Charlotte affiliate of the Rickey Smiley Morning Show.http://www.radiofacts.com/radio-one-charlotte-announces-old-school-105-3/ Owned by Urban One, the station's studios are located in South Charlotte near Carowinds, and the transmitter site is located in Dallas, North Carolina. WOSF is the only commercial station licensed to the South Carolina side of the market that brands itself as a full-market Charlotte station. Indeed, it is the only South Carolina-licensed commercial station that covers Charlotte to any significant extent. History 105.3 signed on as WAGY-FM in 1959, as the FM sister to WAGY (AM 1320) in Forest City, North Carolina. The station at the time was partially owned by Raymond Parker. WAGY-FM was sold entirely to Parker, who with his wife, Bright G. Parker, formed Gaffney Broadcasting in 1971 and moved WAGY-FM to Gaffney, pairing it with their AM WEAC, and changing the call letters to WAGI-FM, increasing the power to 100 kW in the process. WAGI's longtime slogan was \\"The Upstate Power Station\\" and was nicknamed for many years by the locals as \\"Waggie\\". The station had featured a mixture of Country and Southern Gospel music for many years. WAGI broadcast local as well as national news from the NBC Radio Network, as well as local sporting events from Gaffney High School, namely Gaffney Indians football. Also, the station had a morning show called \\"Carolina in the Morning\\" and a popular show called \\"Swap & Shop\\" (heard at 6:35am, 12:15pm, & 5:15pm Monday to Saturday) where listeners could call in to buy, sell, or trade items. After Raymond Parker, the owner of WAGI, died in 2005, his will stipulated that the station be sold upon the death of his wife, Bright G. Parker. Parker's will stated that the station was to remain in Gaffney, though this was ignored by the executors of his will. Upon her death in 2006, the station was sold to Davidson Media under a lease/purchase agreement.Note: the archived article only has the first of three web pages across which the online article is split. In late April 2007, it was announced that the station was sold to local interests in order to ensure that the station remained in the community. Shortly after midnight on April 21, 2007, WAGI ceased operations, moved its studios to Charlotte, North Carolina, then began broadcasting a Regional Mexican format as WNOW-FM, \\"105.3 Poder FM\\", under a Local Marketing Agreement targeting the Charlotte market. Listeners were told that WAGI's former programming could be found on the AM station, which had a limited signal range and broadcast only during the day. Gaffney Indian Football moved to 103.3 WOLT, broadcasting from Greer. Fabian Fuentes (a well-known WAGI personality) remained the announcer for the games. During the games, former commercials featured on WAGI could be heard. These commercials were primarily for the Gaffney area. A construction permit was granted to move 105.3 in order to move its transmitter location to Crowder's Mountain in North Carolina, halfway between Kings Mountain and Gastonia (the same location of 101.9 WBAV-FM, with similar coverage). However, this was changed; the station moved to rented space on WBTV's tower in Dallas in June 2009.http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?list=0&facid;=23006 Even with a power decrease to 51 kW, it still gave WNOW-FM a coverage area comparable to the major Charlotte stations. Starting in 2011, WNOW-FM aired SportsCenter from ESPN Deportes and hourly sports updates. During the 2011-12 season, WNOW-FM aired North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball games, as well as any football games kicking off after 5 pm. This is because the Tar Heel Sports Network's main Charlotte station, WFNZ, had a weak signal at night. This ended after only one season after the Tar Heels signed a new deal with WBT. On August 16, 2012, Radio One announced that it had acquired WNOW-FM from Gaffney Broadcasting. Pending the close of the purchase, Radio One took over the station's programming via a local marketing agreement on August 27, 2012, ending Davidson's involvement with the station. former logo On August 27, 2012, at 5:00 pm, WNOW-FM flipped to Urban Oldies, branded as \\"Old School 105.3\\". Core artists include Luther Vandross, the Isley Brothers, Michael Jackson, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Anita Baker. Radio One regional vice president Gary Weiss said the format had done well on KSOC in the Dallas market. The first song on \\"Old School\\" was \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" by Lakeside. The station changed its call letters to WOSF on November 8, 2012, after the WNOW- FM call sign moved to the former WXRK in New York City. WOSF operated two translators to improve its coverage‚Äîin Charlotte at 96.5 FM, and Dallas (serving Gastonia) at 98.3 FM. In 2014, it sold the translators to Radio Training Network, who converted them into repeaters for its \\"His Radio\\" contemporary Christian network. The translators are now part of the license of His Radio flagship WLFJ-FM in Greenville, South Carolina. However, they identified as \\"His Radio 96.5 and 98.3,\\" and air separate commercials as well. Due to the translators' limited range, the translators' programming was simulcast on WOSF's second HD Radio channel until 2017, when the simulcast moved to a new second channel on WHQC. On August 1, 2018, WOSF shifted its format from urban oldies to urban adult contemporary, branded as \\"105.3, Old School + R&B;\\". With the change, the station's playlist shifted from a 1970s-1990s focus to a 1980s to currents direction. Rickey Smiley, Olympia D and D.L. Hughley remain as personalities.Old School 105.3 Charlotte moves to Urban AC Radioinsight - August 2, 2018 ReferencesExternal links *WOSF's website * *Gaffney Ledger Editorial on the WAGI format change OSF Category:Radio stations established in 1960 Category:Urban One stations Category:Urban adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:1960 establishments in South Carolina ","title":"WOSF"},{"id":"10839775","text":"Kevin J.

It is the United States' largest provider of Spanish-language content nationally, followed by competitor Univision, with programming syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages. The channel broadcasts programs and original content aimed at Latin American audiences in the United States and worldwide, consisting of telenovelas, sports, reality television, news programming and films‚Äîeither imported or Spanish-dubbed. In addition, Telemundo operates NBC Universo, a separate channel directed towards young Hispanic audiences; Telemundo Digital Media, which distributes original programming content across mass media, the Telemundo and NBC Universo websites; Puerto Rico free-to-air station WKAQ-TV; and international distribution arm Telemundo Internacional. Telemundo is headquartered in Miami and operates a studio and productions facility in the Miami suburb of Beacon Lakes, and has 1,900 employees worldwide. The majority of Telemundo's programs are filmed at an operated studio facility in Miami, where 85% of the network's telenovelas were filmed during 2011. The average hourly primetime drama costs $70K to produce. History Originally launched as NetSpan in 1984, the network was renamed Telemundo in 1987, after the network owners purchased the previous owner of WKAQ-TV (channel 2), a television station in San Juan, Puerto Rico, branded on air as Telemundo. WKAQ-TV was signed on on March 28, 1954, and was originally founded by √Ångel Ramos ‚Äì owner of Puerto Rico's main newspaper at the time, El Mundo, and the U.S. territory's first radio station, WKAQ (also known as \\"Radio El Mundo\\"). Ramos wanted to maintain a consistent branding for his media properties based around the \\"mundo\\" theme (the Spanish word for \\"world\\"), and chose to brand his new television property as \\"Telemundo\\" (in effect, translating to \\"Teleworld\\" or \\"World TV\\"). On April 14, 1983, Ramos sold WKAQ-TV to John Blair & Co. Launch as NetSpan (1984‚Äì1987) In 1984, the owners of WNJU (channel 47) in Linden, New Jersey (serving the New York City area) and KSTS (channel 48) in San Jose, California formed NetSpan, the second Spanish-language television network in the continental United States (behind the longer-established Spanish International Network, the forerunner to Univision). These stations joined KVEA (channel 52) in Los Angeles, run by its general manager and part-owner Joe Wallach, in 1985. The following year, KVEA's part-owner, Reliance Group Holdings, acquired the Telemundo brand when it purchased John Blair & Co., which also owned WSCV (channel 51) in Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìMiami-West Palm Beach in addition to WKAQ-TV. In late 1986, Reliance also purchased WNJU. In 1987, Reliance Capital Group executives Saul Steinberg and Henry Silverman merged all these stations into the Telemundo Group. The new corporation quickly went public, and in 1987, Reliance decided to rebrand NetSpan as Telemundo. Later that year, it purchased additional stations in San Francisco, Houston (KTMD, channel 47) and San Antonio (KVDA, channel 60). Relaunch as Telemundo (1988‚Äì1997) Historic Telemundo logos Between 1988 and 1993, Telemundo acquired or affiliated with television stations in Texas (KFWD channel 52, in Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth, now a SonLife affiliate), New Mexico (KTEL-CD channel 47, in Albuquerque), Arizona (KHRR channel 40, in Tucson) and Washington, D.C. (W64BW, channel 64; now WZDC-CD on channel 25). In May 1992, Telemundo underwent another management change, appointing former Univision president Joaquin Blaya ‚Äì who resigned from that network after discovering in an FCC filing for Jerry Perenchio's purchase of the network from Hallmark Cards that Univision would increase its reliance on programming from Televisa and Venevision to levels that resulted in him concluding that there would be fewer opportunities for the addition of local programs on Univision's stations, and was subsequently joined by four other Univision executives ‚Äì to head the network. The following year in 1993, Telemundo underwent an extensive rebranding, introducing the signature framed \\"T\\" letter logo (which has been used by the network since that point in various design elements), and a promotional campaign using the slogan \\"Arriba, Telemundo, Arriba\\" (\\"Upwards, Telemundo, Upwards\\"). The network also began to produce its own original telenovelas, the first of which to premiere were Ang√©lica, mi vida (\\"Angelica, My Life\\"), Marielena, Guadalupe, Se√±ora Tentaci√≥n (\\"Lady Temptation\\") and Tres Destinos (\\"Three Destinations\\"). International distributors soon approached the network for the syndication rights to air these programs on television networks in other countries. Telemundo's effort faced an initial setback when Mexico's leading broadcaster, Televisa, purchased production company Capitalvision, which had been producing the telenovelas in conjunction with the network. Parent company Telemundo Group experienced major financial challenges during this time, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1994, due to a debt load of more than $300 million that the company owed to its creditors. In an effort to boost its tepid ratings and quell complaints from advocacy organizations such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition that criticized both networks for not featuring content relatable to American Latinos, Telemundo outlined a new strategy to better compete against Univision by increasing production of domestically produced programs. In 1995, under the direction of executive vice president of programming Harry Abraham Castillo, Telemundo opened its first network studio on the West Coast. Housed at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, the network began daily production of three shows on the lot that year: La Hora Lun√°tica (\\"The Crazy Hour\\"), a daytime talk-variety show hosted by Los Angeles radio personality Humberto Luna, comedians Mario Ram√≠rez Reyes \\"El Comod√≠n\\" and Hugo Armando, and producer Jackie Torres; El y Ella (\\"He and She\\"), a daily talk show focusing on gender-related issues that was created and produced by Gigi Graciette, who co-hosted the program with Antonio Farr√©; and Dando y Dando (\\"Giving and Giving\\"), an audience and viewer participation game show hosted by Rafael Sigler. The first wave of major changes to Telemundo came on August 11, 1997, when the network revamped its prime time schedule by cutting an hour of its prime time telenovela lineup; concurrently, local newscasts on the network's owned-and-operated and affiliate stations were moved an hour earlier to 10:00 p.m. (or 9:00, depending on the time zone) ‚Äì placing them directly against late-evening newscasts on Fox, WB, UPN and independent stations in many markets ‚Äì followed by a late-evening national newscast produced by cable news channel CBS Telenoticias; movies were also added during the 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern time slot on certain weeknights to help bolster its late newscasts. Liberty Media and Sony Pictures join in (1997‚Äì2001) On November 25, 1997, Liberty Media (the then-parent company of Starz) and Sony Pictures Entertainment (the parent company of Columbia TriStar Home Video) purchased a majority interest in Telemundo from Reliance Capital Group for $539 million, beating out a bid made days earlier by an investment group led by Telemundo Group chairman Leon Black, who had already owned 40.3% of the network through Apollo Global Management and remained a minority partner in Telemundo Group through the purchase; under the deal, Liberty acquired a 40% interest and Sony (which made its entry into domestic broadcasting ownership with the deal) acquired a 35% stake in Telemundo, with the remaining interest held by investment firms Apollo Global Management and Bastion Capital Fund. On November 25, 1997, several investors who held shares in Telemundo Group filed an injunction to block the sale in a Delaware Chancery Court, in order to investigate whether executives were shortchanging shareholders in accepting the offer; that request, as well as a separate injunction request by Univision Communications, were later rejected. After the sale received FCC approval on July 31, 1998, Sony and Liberty formed a holding company that was operated as a 50/50 joint venture between both companies, Telemundo Communications Group. Helmed by yet another management team under the leadership of former CBS entertainment president Peter Tortorici as president and CEO and Nely Gal√°n as president of entertainment, Telemundo explored avenues to attract the bilingual market. The network then launched an image campaign using the slogan \\"Lo mejor de los dos Mundos\\" (\\"The Best of Both Worlds\\"), with several billboard ads being erected in cities such as Miami and San Francisco as part of the campaign, heralding a \\"new era\\" for Telemundo. Tortorici dramatically overhauled Telemundo's schedule in an effort to boost its viewership among American Spanish language audiences, as its total audience share had slid from more than 40% early in the decade to less than 20% (and only a 13% share during prime time) by 1998. This \\"new era\\" broke from the conventional Spanish-language programming model, the changes made for the 1998‚Äì99 lineup included the complete removal of telenovelas from its prime time schedule, citing the inferior quality of the South American serial dramas that it had been acquiring compared to the Mexican serials from Televisa that were carried by Univision. The revamped evening lineup that premiered on September 28, 1998 included several new sitcoms, traditional scripted dramas and game shows with higher production values, including several scripted shows that were remakes of English language series owned by Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television), to position the network as a younger-skewing alternative to Univision more acculturated to assimilated American Latinos. Among them were Angeles (\\"Angels\\"), a remake of Charlie's Angels; Un Angel en la Casa (\\"An Angel in the House\\"), a sitcom loosely based on Who's the Boss?; Solo en America (\\"Living in America\\"), a remake of One Day at a Time. Also added to the lineup were updated Spanish language versions of The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game and Candid Camera; and the police procedural Reyes y Rey (\\"Kings and King\\"). The network's existing prime time novelas were relegated to a three-hour block on weekday mornings, while movies were added in prime time on Tuesday and Thursday nights as part of the showcase \\"Cinemundo\\", featuring dubbed versions of recent American film releases (many of which were sourced from the Sony movie library). In addition, to better take advantage of the region's pool of writers and directors, Tortorici decided to migrate Telemundo's main base of operations ‚Äì transferring its programming and management divisions ‚Äì from Hialeah, Florida to a new facility in Santa Monica, California in December of that year, resulting in the hiring or transfer of approximately 45 employees; more than 300 other employees continued to be based at its Hialeah offices. The changes proved to be disastrous as Telemundo's ratings for the overhauled prime time lineup sharply fell by 42% to an 8% audience share among Latino households against the telenovela-dominated lineup programmed by Univision (which held a roughly 91% share) in that slot by the February 1999 sweeps period; the network was even forced to air numerous commercials for free as part of contractual makegoods to advertisers, resulting in a loss of more than $1 million in potential revenue. After Tortoricci resigned from the network in July 1999, Telemundo tapped former Universal Television president Jim McNamara as its president and chief executive officer, and Alan Sokol as chief operating officer to helm its operations. Their programming strategy reverted to a more traditional approach to Spanish-language television than the mainstream concept implemented by Tortoricci. The new team struck a programming agreement with TV Azteca for the U.S. rights to the Mexican broadcaster's novelas and other programming, and restored a two-hour block of telenovelas originating from Mexico, Colombia and Brazil ‚Äì later expanded to three hours with the shift of its late local and national newscasts to the traditional 11:00 (or 10:00) p.m. time slot in 2000 ‚Äì as part of its Monday through Friday prime time slate which resulted in the cancellation of Angeles and Reyes el Rey. Reality, entertainment and newsmagazine programs were also added to the schedule, while prime time movies were relegated to weekend evenings. In September 1999, Telemundo began transferring the bulk of its programming and marketing operations from its Santa Monica headquarters and consolidated all operations of the network at its offices in Hialeah. Most of the network's management staff migrated to the Hialeah facility including McNamara, Sokol and Galan, either on a temporary or long-term basis, with most other staff being given the option of either accepting the relocation offer or resigning from the network; some positions based at the Santa Monica facility were eliminated entirely, with around a dozen workers remaining at the West Coast office. During McNamara's tenure, Telemundo premiered shows such as Laura en Am√©rica (\\"Laura in America\\"), a \\"conflict talk\\" show hosted by Peruvian lawyer Laura Bozzo; the telenovelas Yo Soy Betty, La Fea (\\"Ugly Betty\\", or literally translated as \\"I Am Betty, the Ugly\\"), starring Ana Maria Orozco; and a novela adaptation of the Brazilian comedy film Xica, starring Ta√≠s Ara√∫jo; A Oscuras Pero Encendidos (\\"In the Dark, but Turned On\\"), a talk show hosted by Paul Bouche; a game show N√∫meros Rojos (\\"Red Numbers\\"), hosted by Wilmer Ramirez; and the Argentine children's program Agrandaditos. It also acquired the rights to broadcast a weekly series from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on Saturday nights. The network also entered into a co- production agreement with Columbia TriStar International Television (now Sony Pictures Television International) to produce original telenovelas for Mexican audiences. The network also launched Protagonistas (\\"Protagonists\\"), a staged, unscripted reality series that followed a group of 16 aspiring actors living together in a Miami television studio for several weeks, for the opportunity to win a role on one of the network's telenovelas. Second chance (2001‚Äì2009) Telemundo's former logo used from 1999 to December 7, 2012. In the summer of 2001, Sony, Liberty and Reliance announced that they would sell Telemundo Communications Group. Companies that expressed interest in acquiring the network included Viacom, the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, The Walt Disney Company and AOL Time Warner; NBC subsequently entered into negotiations to acquire the network and its related properties. On October 11, 2001, NBC (which itself would merge with Vivendi Universal a year-and-a-half later to become the present-day NBC Universal) purchased Telemundo Communications Group from Sony and Liberty Media for $1.98 billion (increasing to $2.7 billion by the sale's closure) and the assumption of $700 million in debt, in an equal cash and stock split by NBC parent General Electric. Upon the announcement, many media industry experts thought that NBC overpaid for Telemundo, given the network's lower Hispanic audience reach (attracting about 20% of all Hispanic viewers in the United States, while Univision had a reach of about 80%). Jim McNamara and Alan Sokol remained at the helm of the network after the acquisition was finalized on April 12, 2002. Under NBC, Telemundo brought greater emphasis to original programming and product placement, while the network's owned-and-operated stations in larger markets began producing their own early morning newscasts in an effort to become more competitive in their respective markets; the Telemundo \\"T\\" logo also received an overhaul, replacing the sphere with a curved outline which similarly represented a globe. Telemundo's main competitor, Univision, continued to beat the network in the ratings, although not in all time periods. In 2004, Telemundo Communications Group formed Telemundo Television Studios (now known as simply Telemundo Studios) in Miami, as part of its expansion of original programming through the acquisition of RTI Colombia's interest in their joint venture Telemundo-RTI, subsequently signing an agreement to acquire the operational assets of its international distributor, Tepuy International (now Telemundo International); the network spent $100 million per year on programming producing during the mid-2000s. After the NBC Universal merger, Telemundo ceased importing telenovelas from Latin America and start producing its own dramas, either independently or through co-production arrangements with other production companies. To that end, Telemundo partnered with Colombian-based producer RTI Colombia and Mexican production company Argos Comunicaci√≥n. In an effort for its telenovelas ‚Äì which follow the Mexican model ‚Äì to be recognized by U.S. and Latin American audiences, Telemundo hired well-known actors and actresses from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Puerto Rico to star in its dramas; over time, Telemundo also began to hire American-born Hispanic actors and actresses who are fluent Spanish speakers. In 2005, McNamara retired as CEO of the network; he was replaced by Don Browne, who had previously served as president and general manager of NBC's Miami O&O; (and WSCV sister station) WTVJ. In March 2007, NBC Universal announced that it would restructure Telemundo's entertainment division in an effort to narrow Univision's ratings dominance. The company also announced its intention to sell the original Telemundo station in Puerto Rico, WKAQ-TV, and Spanish independent station KWHY (channel 22, now a MundoMax affiliate) in Los Angeles in order to help finance its acquisition of Oxygen Media. On December 21, 2007, NBC Universal announced that it would no longer seek a buyer for WKAQ- TV, indicating that Telemundo Puerto Rico would remain within the NBC corporate umbrella.WKAQ-TV \\"Telenoticias a las 5:00 P.M.\\" in a short message by Don Browne (NBC/Telemundo Network president). Part of Comcast (2011‚Äìpresent) In 2010, Comcast announced that it would acquire a 51% majority stake in NBC Universal for $6.5 billion; the deal was completed on January 28, 2011, with Comcast acquiring control of Telemundo as part of the deal. In October 2011, Emilio Romano was appointed as president of Telemundo, a role he would handle until his abrupt resignation from the network in October 2013. First variant of the Telemundo's logo from December 8, 2012 to April 3, 2018. On May 14, 2012, Telemundo announced that it would launch a new branding campaign that would include the debut of a new slogan and on-air identity, including the replacement of its framed \\"T\\" logo (a variant of the 1992-era design that had been introduced by the network in 1999), with a new logo featuring two partial red spheres forming the \\"T\\", described to \\"capture the duality of Telemundo‚Äôs audience, balancing the strong connection to their Latin roots with their contemporary mindset of living in the U.S.\\" The new logo and graphics package debuted on-air on December 8 of that year. Telemundo achieved ratings success during 2012, with the telenovela series Rosa Diamante (\\"Diamond Rose\\"; a remake of Enrique Torres' Perla Negra) and the Caracol TV- produced Pablo Escobar. That year, Telemundo debuted the \\"social novela\\" ' on Facebook, with comments made on other social media websites. During the 2000s, Univision also lost several key on-air personalities to Telemundo, including longtime weekend news anchor Mar√≠a Antonieta Collins (who left to host the morning program Cada Dia), Primer Impacto anchor Mar√≠a Celeste Arrar√°s (who became the host of a similarly formatted newsmagazine, Al Rojo Vivo) and sports announcers Andr√©s Cantor (known to many Americans for his exuberant announcement of \\"Goal!\\" during football matches) and Norberto Longo. By the middle of the decade, Univision overtook UPN and The WB ‚Äì which shut down in September 2006 and were replaced by The CW, which Univision also outranks ‚Äì as the fifth highest-rated network in total viewership; since then, it also sometimes posts higher viewership in the key age demographics of Adults 18‚Äì34 and Adults 18‚Äì49. Other key on-air personalities that joined Telemundo from Univision or Televisa in the 2000s are Gabriela Spanic, Pedro Fernandez, Kate del Castillo, Aracely Ar√°mbula, Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez, Blanca Soto, Laura Flores, Ana Mar√≠a Canseco, Cristina Saralegui. Continuing the momentum in 2013 were telenovelas La Patrona (\\"The Return\\") and El Se√±or de los Cielos (\\"The Lord of the Skies\\"), and the musical competition series La Voz Kids (\\"The Voice Kids\\"; a Spanish language adaptation of The Voice franchise featuring children as contestants), hosted by Daisy Fuentes and Jorge Bernal, featuring musical coaches Paulina Rubio, Prince Royce and Roberto Tapia. With the debut of El Se√±or de los Cielos that spring, Telemundo also launched the \\"Super Series\\" format, a slate of action-oriented telenovelas ‚Äì which usually air during the final hour of the network's prime time novela block ‚Äì designed as a reinvention of the genre using the multiple-season continuity model common with English language drama series, shorter episode runs (between 60 and 80 episodes per season, compared to traditional single-season novelas, which produce between 100 and 200 episodes on average) and the incorporation of storylines more relatable to American audiences. These programs helped Telemundo decrease its ratings gap in the key demographic of Adults 18‚Äì49, decreasing the gap between the two networks by 54% between 2010 and 2015, with Telemundo even beating Univision four times during the 2014‚Äì2015 television season on nights when the former aired sports events and specials; the network also narrowed the ratings differentials with Univision in total prime time viewership from a gap of 1.2 million viewers in July 2013 to 238,000 in July 2015. Telemundo also began improving its ratings during the 10:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) hour, following its transition from traditional novelas to the \\"Super Series\\" format, with El Se√±or de los Cielos posting some of the network's highest viewership for an entertainment program, when its second- season finale in 2014 drew 3.2 million total viewers. On May 13, 2014, during the network's 2014‚Äì15 upfront presentation at Frederick P. Rose Hall in New York City, Luis Silberwasser was named president of Telemundo Network, LLC, maintaining overall responsibilities for the Telemundo network and production division Telemundo Studios. On July 21, 2015, Telemundo beat Univision for the first time in a singular-night demographic, averaging 969,000 viewers and a .76 rating in the demographic (26K more viewers and a .2 higher share than the 943K and .74 earned by Univision's prime-time schedule); El Senor de los Cielos 3 (\\"Lord of the Skies 3\\") also beat the Televisa-produced novela Yo No Creo En los Hombres (\\"I Don't Trust Men Anymore\\") on Univision in the demographic during the 10:00 p.m. hour, with a 1.4 rating (over the 0.7 rating earned by Yo No Creo En Hombres) and was the most-watched television program among Adults 18-49 during the hour that evening. For the week of July 20‚Äì24, Telemundo came within 40,000 viewers of beating Univision in prime time viewership. Overall, the network ended the 2014‚Äì15 season posting its highest average total prime time viewership against Univision with 1.46M, a 23% increase in total viewership yearly, compared to Univision's 2.29M and decrease of 21% yearly. Programming , Telemundo operates on a 147¬Ω-hour network programming schedule. Its base programming feed provides various types of general entertainment programming weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., Saturdays from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. (the first three hours of which are occupied by the children's programming block, MiTelemundo, which features programs compliant with FCC educational programming requirements), and Sundays from 11:00 to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. A separate block of feature films (and occasionally, other entertainment programs) also airs overnights on Monday through Wednesdays from 3:30 to 5:00 a.m., Thursdays and Fridays from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m., and weekends from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. All remaining time periods are filled with infomercials. While Telemundo's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates largely rely on Telemundo's master schedule to fill their broadcast day, many of its stations also produce their own local programming (which may pre-empt certain programs within the base network schedule), usually in the form of newscasts and public affairs programs (production of local infotainment programming, and leasing of brokered programs such as direct response and religious content, is at the station's discretion). Many Telemundo stations usually air limited local news programming, which are commonly reserved for early and late evening timeslots on Monday through Friday nights; some Telemundo stations may also air newscasts on weekday mornings (these are mainly limited to the network's O&Os; in larger markets) and/or on weekend evenings. The majority of Telemundo's programming consists of first-run telenovelas and series, many of which are produced by the network itself through its Telemundo Studios unit; however, some shows broadcasts by the network are produced by outside companies (including Caracol Television and Promofilm). Telemundo's schedule does not incorporate situation comedies, although some comedy series have aired on the network in the past, particularly during the 1990s and early 2000s. Variety shows, a common format in Spanish language television in the U.S. and other countries, have had a limited presence on Telemundo's lineup in recent years; with La Voz Kids being the only such show appearing on the network as of July 2013. Two additional variety series debuted in 2015: Si Se Puede, an adaptation of the Armoza Formats celebrity talent competition franchise I Can Do That, and ¬°Qu√© Noche! con Angelica y Raul (\\"What a Night! with Angelica and Raul\\"), a family-oriented series using the traditional Saturday evening variety program model that was created to fill part of the void opened up by the cancellation of Univision's Sabado Gigante. From 2010 to 2013, Telemundo utilized an off-time scheduling format for its prime time programming (similar to the \\"Turner Time\\" format used by TBS from 1981 to 2000), in which programs that aired weeknights from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) started on a three-minute delay ‚Äì resulting from intentional overruns of the network's 7:00 p.m. program (Caso Cerrado: Ediƒáion Estelar (\\"Case Closed: Special Edition\\")) into the 8:00 p.m. timeslot. As a result, until this format was discontinued, conventional \\"top-and-bottom\\" start times were not restored until the evening's final prime time program aired at 10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific), allowing late local newscasts seen on some Telemundo stations to start at 11:00 p.m. (or 10:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain Time Zones). Daytime programming on weekdays features a mix of consisting of repeats of past Telemundo-produced telenovelas and acquired serials (which are re-edited as extended 90-minute and two-hour episodes) during the late morning and early afternoon hours, while newsmagazine, reality and court series (such as Caso Cerrado (\\"Case Closed\\") and Suelta La Sopa (\\"Tell Me What You Know\\")) making up its afternoon programming. The network also regularly airs Spanish-dubbed English-language films (primarily those produced by American film studios such as Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment) that make up much of the network's weekend afternoon and prime time lineup, as well as films natively produced in Spanish (imported from various Latin American countries) that it usually airs daily during the overnight hours; the network also airs films in place of regularly scheduled programming on select national holidays (such as Thanksgiving and Christmas). English subtitles On-screen bug used on programs captioned in Spanish and English. Telemundo provides English subtitles via closed captioning primarily on weekdays from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, during the network's prime time lineup. The subtitles are transmitted over the CC3 caption channel in standard definition and the CS2 caption channel available on most digital tuners in high definition. The network produces the translations in-house, and intends them to attract Hispanic viewers who may not be fluent in Spanish as well as other non-Spanish speakers. Programs that include English captions are identified on-air by a special digital on-screen graphic seen at the start of each episode, denoting the specific caption channels in which viewers can receive subtitles in either Spanish or English (see right). Telemundo was the first Spanish-language network in the United States to incorporate English captions during its programming, beginning with the premieres of La Cenicienta (\\"Cinderella\\") and Amor Descarado (\\"Barefaced Love\\") on September 8, 2003; this generated a small, loyal fan base among English-speaking viewers. The subtitles were briefly discontinued without notice on October 14, 2008, citing budget cuts made by NBC Universal and the network's switch from analog to digital broadcasts; representatives for Telemundo also cited the need to concentrate resources on its core Spanish- speaking audience. However, the network soon reversed its decision due to demand by viewers in favor of the English subtitles, which returned on all prime time novelas on March 30, 2009. The use of English captions was later adopted by Univision, which began airing them on its evening programming (primarily with its weeknight telenovelas, along with select weekend prime time series) on January 30, 2012, and (in the same manner as Telemundo) transmits them over the CC3 caption channel; Azteca also transmits English language captions on certain programs. Programs that include English-language captions during their original broadcast may also include them in repeat broadcasts airing outside of the network's prime time schedule after the program's original run on the network or, since 2012, as part of the network's late-night novela repeat block. Some programs (notably the defunct long- running erotic anthology Decisiones (\\"Decisions\\"), which the network now airs only in reruns), include English captions only for certain episodes, depending on when they were produced. Programs that use English captions are primarily consist of telenovelas, though a few shows outside the genre (such as the prime time court show Caso Cerrado: Edici√≥n Especial) are also transcribed in both languages. Availability of English subtitles is limited to the technical capacity of the local station, cable or satellite provider, or other outlet to disseminate them over the network feed. News programming The network operates a news division, Noticias Telemundo (\\"Telemundo News\\"), which produces a half-hour early evening flagship newscast, Noticiero Telemundo, that has aired daily for most of its run (Telemundo also produced a secondary newscast, Noticiero Telemundo Internacional, until 2011, which aired in place of late local newscasts on affiliates without their own news department or which opted to preempt regularly scheduled local newscasts on certain holidays). It also produces the morning news and lifestyle program Un Nuevo D√≠a (\\"A New Day\\"), the late afternoon newsmagazine series Al Rojo Vivo con Maria Celeste (\\"Red Hot Live with Maria Celeste\\") and the Sunday morning talk show Enfoque (\\"In Focus\\"); the network previously produced weekend editions of Al Rojo Vivo and Noticiero Telemundo until 2007, which were replaced with feature films and reality-based series; the latter returned to a daily broadcast with the restoration of Saturday and Sunday editions on September 4, 2014. The beginnings of the news division trace back to 1987, when the network debuted its first news program Noticiero Telemundo-HBC (\\"Telemundo-HBC News\\"), through an outsourcing agreement with the Miami-based Hispanic-American Broadcasting Corporation. The following year, Telemundo outsourced news production to CNN, which produced Noticiero Telemundo CNN (\\"Telemundo CNN News\\"), consisting of two Atlanta-based daily newscasts that were anchored by Jorge Gestoso and Maria Elvira Salazar. When Salazar accepted a position as a reporter for Noticiero Univision in Miami, Chilean former Miss Universe Cecilia Bolocco joined Gestoso on the Telemundo newscast. The final incarnation produced in Atlanta was co-anchored by Patricia Janiot. Following the sale of its cable news channel Telenoticias to CBS Cable in late 1996, Telemundo entered into a content partnership with the channel to produce early-evening and prime time newscasts that would air on the broadcast network. Former CBS News vice president Joe Peyronnin founded Telemundo's news division in 1999 and served as its executive vice president until 2006. Additional news programs were created in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks: Hoy en el Mundo (\\"Today in the World\\") on ABC News, anchored by Marian de la Fuente and Jose Diaz-Balart (also of NBC News), debuted to inform viewers of national and international events. This program and its companion show En la Madrugada (\\"In Early Morning\\") were cancelled due to the much heralded arrival of Mar√≠a Antonieta Collins from Univision. Cada Dia with Maria Antonieta (\\"Every Day with Maria Antonieta\\") replaced these shows on October 10, 2005; Collins continued to host the program along with the much recycled Diaz-Balart ‚Äì who anchored the network's morning news program Noticiero Telemundo: Madrugada (\\"Telemundo News: Early Morning\\"), later to be anchored by Ana Patricia Candiani ‚Äì as co-host. Cada Dia was cancelled in May 2008, after Collins announced that she would leave Telemundo when her contract expired in August of that year return to news anchoring and as a result of low ratings for the program;In an interview in \\"People En Espanol\\". it was replaced by a new morning show called ¬°Lev√°ntate! (\\"Get Up\\"), another hybrid news and lifestyle format, which was broadcast out of the studios of WKAQ-TV, and initially produced by Telemundo Puerto Rico. The hybrid program, which was retitled Un Nuevo D√≠a in July 2012, originally included local participation of the network's Miami owned-and-operated station WSCV from its studios in the suburb of Miramar, Florida, and bureaus located in New York City, Los Angeles and Mexico City. The show was later revamped, dropping the local cut-ins and relocating its production operations to Telemundo's headquarters in Hialeah, Florida in February 2011. Sports The network also maintains a sports division, Telemundo Deportes, which superseded the network-operated division Deportes Telemundo when NBCUniversal created the current division within its NBC Sports Group in May 2015. The division, which is responsible for the production of sports content on Telemundo and Universo, produces association football matches for the network from Liga MX, as well as CONCACAF Champions League tournament events (including Olympic qualifying matches). Through broadcasting agreements with NBC Sports, Telemundo also holds the Spanish- language broadcast rights to the Summer and Winter Olympic Games and Spanish play-by-rights to association football matches from the Premier League. The network also produces Boxeo Telemundo, a weekly late-night boxing series that airs on most Friday nights (except during the summer) showcasing fights from up-and-coming boxing talents. In 2014, Deportes Telemundo acquired the Spanish language rights to broadcast the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cup for a reported $600 million. The deal, which began with the 2015 Women's World Cup and runs through 2026, includes rights to associated FIFA-sanctioned tournaments (including the FIFA U-17 and U-20 World Cups, and the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup), which are telecast on Telemundo and Universo. In addition, the division also produces three weekly sports-related talk and magazine programs for Telemundo: flagship sports highlight/discussion program Titulares Telemundo (\\"Telemundo Headlines\\"), which airs on Saturday and Sunday evenings (and is offered to Telemundo stations on a half-hour tape delay to accommodate local late-evening newscasts); the male-oriented Sunday afternoon sports/lifestyle program Ritmo Deportivo (\\"Rhythm Sports\\"; which debuted in 2003, and briefly aired on Saturdays from September 2013 to April 2015); and the late-night sports talk show Titulares y Mas (\\"Headlines and More\\"; which originally aired on Thursday and Friday nights until 2014, when it expanded into a five-night-a-week broadcast). Children's programming For much of its history, the bulk of NetSpan/Telemundo's children's programming has been derived of mainly live-action and animated programming from American and international producers, with most consisting of dubbed versions of series natively produced in English or Japanese. In September 1995, Telemundo launched a Saturday morning program block, Telemundo Infantil (\\"Telemundo Kids\\"), which was developed via input from viewers on what they wanted to be featured in a children's show. On September 15, 1998, Telemundo entered into a programming agreement with Nickelodeon to carry the cable channel's programming as part of a morning children's program block, \\"Nickelodeon en Telemundo\\" (\\"Nickelodeon on Telemundo\\"). The block, which debuted on November 9, 1998 and was considered a sub-block of Telemundo Infantil, consisted of Spanish dubs of Nickelodeon's animated series aimed at older children and preschool-oriented programs aired by the channel's Nick Jr. block (such as Rugrats, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, Hey Arnold!, Rocko's Modern Life and Blue's Clues). The block ran on weekday mornings until September 5, 2000, when it was relegated to Saturday and Sunday mornings in order to accommodate a time slot for Hoy En El Mundo (lit. \\"Today in the World\\" or \\"In the World Today\\"). Nickelodeon's contract with Telemundo ended in November 2001, following the network's acquisition by NBC; Hey Arnold! continued to be aired sporadically for a few years afterward. After Nickelodeon en Telemundo was discontuned, Telemundo evetually launched a weekend morning block that turned out to be a revival of the \\"Telemundo Kids‚Äù block, but branded differently fromthe block from the block from 1995-1998. The block consisted of Spanish dubs of various Nickelodeon and Canadian shows such as All Grown Up, Wimzie's House, Hey Arnold!, Dora the Explorer and Jacob Two-Two. Following the sale of Telemundo to NBC in 2001 and the CBS/Viacom split in early 2006, the block was discontinued September 2, 2006. However, Jacob Two-Two carried over to the block‚Äôs direct successor Qubo, which premiered the following week. On September 9, 2006, Telemundo debuted a weekend morning block aimed at younger children as part of the Qubo endeavor, which was formed through a partnership between NBC Universal, Ion Media Networks, Corus Entertainment, Scholastic Media, Classic Media and its subsidiary Big Idea Productions. The Qubo block featured Spanish dubs of programs seen on its companion blocks on NBC, Ion Television, and its companion 24/7 network (alternatively known as Qubo Channel), with Telemundo's Qubo block airing on Saturday and Sunday mornings in 90-minute blocks. On March 28, 2012, NBCUniversal announced an agreement with sister cable channel PBS Kids Sprout (now Universal Kids, which was integrated into NBCUniversal through its 2011 acquisition by the channel's existing part-owner Comcast) to produce and program new weekend morning preschool blocks for NBC and Telemundo. The block, MiTelemundo, premiered on July 7, 2012 and also airs Saturday and Sunday mornings; as with its predecessors, it consists of Spanish dubbed versions of programs seen on its sister broadcast network's Saturday morning block, NBC Kids, which debuted on the same date. With NBC Kids being replaced with Litton Entertainment's The More You Know E/I block on NBC by September 25, 2016, MiTelemundo retained on television; while the same programming from the former NBC Kids block initially remained on MiTelemundo, Litton would ultimately start providing Spanish-language programming for Telemundo as well starting on January 6, 2018, coinciding with the move to airing the block solely on Saturdays, retaining the MiTelemundo name. Specials Telemundo holds the broadcast rights to several annual specials and award show telecasts. From 2003 to 2014, the network held the Spanish language rights to two of the three pageants organized by the Miss Universe Organization: the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants, through NBC's existing contractual agreement for the pageant. Although parent NBCUniversal held half-ownership in the organization at the time, the rights were obtained by Univision Communications in February 2015 with the intent to move the Miss Universe and Miss USA telecasts to UniM√°s (Univision later terminated the contract that July following now-former part- owner Donald Trump's remarks in his speech declaring his Republican Presidential campaign disparaging Mexicans immigrating into the United States as being mostly made up of those involved in criminal activity, later culminating in Trump's sale of the Miss Universe Organization to WME-IMG in September 2015, after NBCUniversal sold its interest). Since 1999, Telemundo has served as the official U.S. broadcaster of the Billboard Latin Music Awards (\\"Premios Billboard a la M√∫sica Latina\\"), an offshoot of the Billboard Music Awards honoring songs from Latin music artists during the previous year that are chosen by viewer voting. In 2012, the network also debuted Premios Tu Mundo (\\"Your World Awards\\"), a viewer-decided awards show honoring the achievements of Hispanics and Latinos in media, maintaining a format similar to the People's Choice Awards with categories pertaining to television, film, music, fashion and sports. In October 2015, through a licensing agreement with Dick Clark Productions signed in July 2014, Telemundo became the originating broadcaster of the Latin American Music Awards (\\"Premios de la M√∫sica Latinoamericana\\"), a Latin music-focused version of the American Music Awards. Stations , Telemundo has 28 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 66 additional television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S.territory of Puerto Rico; this makes Telemundo the largest American Spanish language broadcast television network by total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 57.23% of all households in the United States (or 178,837,113 Americans with at least one television set). While Telemundo does not have any over-the-air stations in a few major markets with relatively sizeable populations of Hispanic and Latino residents (most notably Cleveland, Ohio) it conversely maintains affiliations in several markets where Univision currently does not have over-the-air availability, including New Orleans (KGLA-DT), Indianapolis (WDNI-CD) Boise (KKJB) and Richmond (WZTD-LD). Telemundo maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Orlando (WTMO-CD), Milwaukee (WYTU-LD), Tampa (WRMD-CD), Albuquerque (KTEL-CD and its repeater K46GY) and Minneapolis (KMBD-LD). In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a full- power television station, usually (though not in all cases) one that is owned or managed with the Telemundo outlet. The network also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, consisting of a mix of stations in cities located within and outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest Telemundo subchannel affiliate by market size is WKTB-CD in Norcross, Georgia (serving the Atlanta market), which carries the network on its second digital subchannel. In other areas of the U.S., Telemundo provides a national cable network feed that is distributed directly to cable, satellite and IPTV providers as an alternative method of distribution in markets without either the availability or the demand for a locally based owned-and-operated or affiliate station. Currently outside of the network's core O&O; group, News-Press & Gazette Company is the largest operator of Telemundo stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to eight primary affiliates (all but one of which are simulcast on subchannels of the group's Big Four network stations) and four additional subchannel-only affiliates). The former ZGS Communications was the largest operator of Telemundo stations in terms of overall market reach, owning ten Telemundo- affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as Tampa, Orlando, Boston, Hartford and Washington, D.C.); after the purchase of the ZGS stations at the start of 2018 by NBC's Telemundo Stations Group, they are now direct O&Os; of the network. Related services=Current sister channelsUniverso= Universo is an American digital cable and satellite television network that is aimed at Latinos between the ages of 18 and 49, featuring a mix of sports, scripted and reality series and music programming (including programs that originated on Telemundo and other NBCUniversal-owned cable networks). It was originally launched on October 10, 1993 as GEMS Television, under the ownership by Empresas 1BC, featuring programs aimed at Latino females. The network was as GEMS Television by former owner and later co-owned with Cox Communications the following year. Telemundo parents Sony Pictures Entertainment and Liberty Media purchased GEMS in 2001, and relaunched it as mun2 (a portmanteau pun of Telemundo and \\"dos,\\" the Spanish word for \\"2,\\" butbis intended to reflect the \\"two worlds\\" that Latino Americans live in), a network featuring a mix of Spanish and English language programs (including some Spanish-dubbed versions of American programs and series incorporating Spanish language subtitles) aimed at adults ages 18 to 49. On December 24, 2014, NBCUniversal announced that mun2 would be rebranded as NBC Universo ‚Äì shifting it under the NBC umbrella ‚Äì on February 1, 2015, to coincide with its Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX. =Telemundo Puerto Rico= Telemundo Puerto Rico is a digital cable and satellite network that originally launched in December 1994 as Telenoticias, a Spanish-language cable news channel originally serving Latin America (and broadcasting in Spanish and Portuguese) that was developed by Telemundo in partnership with Grupo Clar√≠n (owner of Argentina-based broadcaster Artear), Spain-based Antena 3 and Reuters. Due to struggles in obtaining sufficient viewership and disagreements between its co-owners, the partnership sold Telenoticias to CBS ‚Äì which rebranded the network as \\"CBS Telenoticias\\" ‚Äì in June 1996; with that sale, the network expanded across the Americas, with distribution in 22 countries. In 1998, CBS later sold Telenoticias back to Telemundo parents Sony Pictures Entertainment and Liberty Media, which subsequently relaunched the network as the bilingual entertainment channel Telemundo Internacional in 2000. In 2006, the channel was reformatted as Telemundo Puerto Rico, becoming a national superstation feed of San Juan O&O; WKAQ-TV. =TeleXitos= TeleXitos is a digital multicast network that was originally launched by the network's parent division Telemundo Television Group in January 2012 as Exitos TV. In its original format, the network primarily featured reruns of telenovelas previously aired on Telemundo, and was exclusive to Telemundo's owned-and-operated stations. The network adopted its current name on December 1, 2014, when it was relaunched with a new focus toward Spanish-dubbed reruns of action and adventure series as well as feature films sourced primarily from the content library of corporate sister NBCUniversal Television Distribution, in addition to featuring select programs from other distributors. Video-on- demand services Telemundo maintains several video on demand services for delayed viewing of the network's programming, including its TV Everywhere service Telemundo Now; a traditional VOD service called Telemundo on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers (and like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks, disallows fast forwarding of accessed content); and via Hulu and iTunes through content deals with those services. Through its ownership by Comcast, the network's programming is also available through Xfinity on Demand. Cataloged episodes of past telenovelas seen on the network are also available on DramaFever, a streaming service that had originally exclusively focused on television shows and movies imported from various Asian countries, through a distribution deal signed on December 13, 2013. =Telemundo Now= On October 22, 2013, Telemundo launched \\"Telemundo Now\\", a multi-platform streaming service (which derived its name from that of a similar TV Everywhere service operated by sister network Bravo, \\"Bravo Now\\"), originally encompassing a dedicated streaming portal at TelemundoNow.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers supporting the iOS and Android platforms. Recent full-length episodes of the network's shows as well as specials are usually made available on Telemundo Now (as well as Telemundo on Demand) the day after their original broadcast to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Comcast, AT&T; U-verse, Optimum, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Dish Network, Mediacom, Suddenlink Communications and Verizon FiOS) using an ISP account via an authenticated user login. The service also offers special features like \\"Mi Lista,\\" viewers can catalogue their favorite shows for fast access and easily resume play to pick up right where they left off. Telemundo HD Telemundo's master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution format for NBCUniversal's U.S. television properties. However, twelve Telemundo-affiliated stations (including a standard definition simulcast of San Francisco O&O; KSTS that is carried on a subchannel of sister station KNTV) transmit the network's programming in 720p HD, while 31 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry Telemundo programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed Telemundo affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD. As of July 2019, Telemundo's network feed originates from NBCUniversal's corporate office in Centennial, CO (along with the NBC broadcast network), a technical operations facility that is shared with Comcast. The network utilizes three satellite uplink facilities to distribute its signal. One in Littleton, CO, a short distance from the network's master control operation; a second in Universal City, CA, near the Universal Studios lot; and a third in Englewood Cliffs, NJ at the CNBC building, which also houses master control operations for NBCUniversal's cable properties, including Universo. Telemundo became the first national Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S. to provide its prime time programming in high definition through the network and its local stations (nine years after the major English language broadcast networks began their conversion to HD) with the launch of its simulcast feed, Telemundo HD, on April 23, 2009, with that year's edition of the Billboard Latin Music Awards as its inaugural HD broadcast. Concurrently, Telemundo's owned-and-operated television stations in nine markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, Houston, Miami, Las Vegas, and San Juan) became the first to begin broadcasting the network's programming in HD; the remaining O&Os; upgraded their digital signals to allow the transmission of high definition content over the next twelve months, while its affiliated stations gradually followed suit over a four-year period. The network's scripted prime time telenovelas became the first regularly scheduled Telemundo shows to upgrade to the format, beginning with Mas Sabe El Diablo (\\"Falling Angel\\"), which premiered in September 2009. All of the network's first-run entertainment and sports programming, as well as specials and select acquired programs, have been presented in HD since 2012 (with the current exception of archived programs that were made prior to 2009 ‚Äì such as dubbed versions of Criss Angel Mindfreak and World's Most Amazing Videos (\\"Videos M√°s Asombrosos del Mundo\\") ‚Äì and were originally produced in 4:3 standard definition, as well as most older Mexican-produced feature films). The weekend morning MiTelemundo E/I block has also been broadcast in HD since its debut in July 2012. As of September 1, 2018, Telemundo has converted its presentation to a 16:9 presentation. Al Rojo Vivo became the first program to be presented in a 16:9 format, beginning Telemundo's transition to such presentation. Controversies= SAG-AFTRA  On February 9, 2016, NBC Universal, Telemundo's parent company, faced claims by SAG-AFTRA of operating under a double standard between its Spanish-language and English-language talent at NBC and Telemundo. In their response, the network released a statement claiming they are ‚Äúcommitted to making Telemundo a great place to work for our employees and will continue to invest in them to ensure their salaries and working conditions are competitive with the rest of the broadcasting industry in accordance with market size and station revenues.‚Äù A few days later on February 13, 2016, SAG-AFTRA came back and added that Telemundo had been treating its employees like ‚Äúsecond-class professionals‚Äù given that many actors do not receive basic workplace guarantees that SAG-AFTRA contracts provide, such as fair pay, water breaks, health insurance and residuals. At that time, Telemundo president Luis Silberwasser responded saying that SAG- AFTRA asked for recognition of the union as the bargaining agent for employees ‚Äî rather than seeking a vote by employees. However, SAG-AFTRA claimed that intimidation tactics had been taking place within the network to keep employees from unionizing and that they believe ‚Äúthere is no such thing as a ‚Äòfair vote‚Äô when workers are afraid for their careers and livelihoods, and live with the fear of retaliation if they are seen as actively wanting to unionize. SAG-AFTRA wants to ensure full protection for workplace democracy and performers‚Äô rights to choose through a truly fair process.‚Äù In August 2016, Telemundo once again found itself up against the union when the network refused to air an ad placed by SAG-AFTRA detailing the unfair wage gap and lack of benefits Telemundo employees face as opposed to unionized performers at NBCUniversal. The ad was set to air during the network‚Äôs premiere people‚Äôs choice awards Premios Tu Mundo but was never placed into rotation. A Telemundo spokesperson responded saying, ‚ÄúAfter legal review, we have concluded the ad did not pass legal standards for issue-based advertisement.‚Äù Meanwhile, other Spanish-language networks such as MegaTV and Estrella TV aired the ad nationwide. SAG-AFTRA continued to stand its ground, stating that \\"Telemundo's decision to censor 30 seconds of truthful commentary about its working conditions shows just how averse it is to having a transparent discussion about its refusal to fairly compensate Spanish-speaking performers.\\"  2016 presidential election  On May 28, 2016, filmmaker Andrew Marcus caught a cameraman from Telemundo filming a #NeverTrump protest in San Diego. According to the filmmaker, the protest was staged. L. Brent Bozell III, the president of Media Research Center responded by demanding Telemundo to apologize to Donald Trump and to fire the crew involved with the incident. Meanwhile, Ken Oliver-M√©ndez, the director of MRC Latino, described that the incident as a \\"self-inflicted wound on Telemundo's credibility.\\" Telemundo responded to Oliver-M√©ndez by claiming that \\"the integrity of the broadcast was not compromised since the material was not used by the Network news team.\\" Telemundo also claimed that the network is \\"known for its balance and accuracy,‚Äù and that it ‚Äúdid not, nor would it ask any full-time or temporary worker to stage events.‚Äù International broadcasts=Mexico Telemundo programming is available in Mexico through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border (such as owned-and- operated stations KHRR/Tucson, Arizona, KUAN/San Diego, KTLM/Rio Grande City, and KTDO/El Paso and other afiflates; KESE-LP-KECY-DT4/Yuma, and KGNS- DT3/Laredo), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico. On March 18, 2008, Grupo Televisa and NBC Universal announced a ten-year multiplatform agreement that would allow 1,000 hours of Telemundo programming, including news; entertainment; specials and sports, to be broadcast over both Televisa's free-to-air channels, as well as its co- owned cable provider SKY M√©xico starting that April. The deal also included plans to launch a Telemundo channel that would be operated as a joint venture between both companies; the Mexican cable-satellite version of the network launched in August 2009. NBC Universal had considered launching a Mexican version of Telemundo as early as 2005, which led to a legal battle between it and TV Azteca over allegations that Azteca \\"engaged in the wrongful use of force\\" to shut down production of the Telemundo-produced reality singing competition series Quincea√±era: Mama Quiero Ser Artista (\\"Sweet 15: Mom, I Want to Be an Artist\\") in Mexico and a news story featured on an Azteca news program that accused then-NBC Universal parent General Electric and Grupo Casa Saba of fraud and corporate corruption with the intent to torpedo the approval of a license application by Telemundo and Grupo Xtra to operate a television network in Mexico.

P√≠o del Pilar (born P√≠o Isidro y Casta√±eda; July 11, 1860 ‚Äì June 21, 1931) was a revolutionary general of the Philippines. To safeguard his family and prevent them from harassment, he changed his surname to del Pilar. He was born in Barrio Culi-culi (now Pio del Pilar), San Pedro de Macati (present-day Makati) on 11 July 1860. Early life and education Del Pilar was born to Isaac del Pilar, a farmer from Pasay, and Antonia Casta≈àeda, an embroider from Mandaluyong. As a child, his parents had him study for two years in the school of Pascual Rodriguez, and for four months under Ramon Renaldo, until he was forced to stop to work in the family farm. Typical of other Filipinos at the time, del Pilar knew little or no Spanish, but was fluent in Tagalog. Del Pilar married his childhood friend, Juliana Valeriano, at the age of 17. He was barely married for a year before he was drafted in the Spanish Army. He was assigned in Mindanao for a year, however his service was cut short to four months due to the intervention of a family friend. In 1890, de Pilar was appointed cabeza de barangay and later on, became teniente del barrio in Makati. During this time, he had a chance meeting with Jose Rizal, and was inspired to distribute copies of his novel, Noli Me Tangere. Role in Philippine Revolution In May 1896, he joined the Katipunan and formed a chapter called Matagumpay (Triumphant), taking the symbolic name Pang-una (). His chapter also adopted a flag, a white triangle with a K at each corner, at the hoist of a red field, in the center of which was a mountain with a rising sun on it. This flag was known as the Bandila ng Matagumpay (Flag of the Triumphant) and was del Pilar's personal standard during the revolution. At the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, del Pilar was arrested by Spanish authorities for suspected membership in the Katipunan. Although tortured, he did not reveal any secrets about the group until he was released. Del Pilar participated in his first battle in Mandaluyong on August 29, 1896. He also led a group of rebels in the Battle of Binakayan on November 9, 1896, capturing the town from Spanish authorities. On February 16, 1897, bearing the rank of colonel, del Pilar defended Bacoor and Las Pi√±as. Subsequently, he was promoted to brigadier-general. Del Pilar was present in the Tejeros Convention on March 22, 1897, which marked the split between the Magdiwang and Magdalo factions of the Katipunan. Because of the events of the Convention, he aligned himself with Bonifacio, eventually signing the Naic Military Agreement declaring the results of the convention to be null and void. In time, however, he switched sides, aligning himself with the Magdalo faction and becoming one of Emilio Aguinaldo's trusted generals. It was del Pilar (along with Gen. Mariano Noriel) that advised Aguinaldo to change the commutation (banishment) to execution of Andr√©s and Procopio Bonifacio. His last battle was with the Americans, in the town of Morong. He fought bravely but he and his men were defeated and captured. Del Pilar was exiled to Guam along with Apolinario Mabini, Artemio Ricarte, and other patriots. He returned to the Philippines after Governor William Howard Taft extended pardons to the revolutionaries. He continued to fight for the cause of the Filipino people by supporting the Jones Bill for Filipinos' preparation for self governance. He died on 21 June 1931 at the age of 70 due to lingering illness.

Her older brother, Michael Crowe, and two of his friends were initially charged with her murder, but were eventually declared to be factually innocent by a judge. Their confessions under police interrogation are regarded as classic examples of false confession. A transient who was seen in the neighborhood on the night of her murder was eventually convicted of manslaughter, but the conviction was overturned. A November 2013 retrial acquitted him of all charges. Crime Stephanie's parents and grandmother found her body on the floor of her bedroom on the morning of January 21, 1998. She had been stabbed nine times. There was no sign of forced entry. Stephanie's window was found unlocked, but a screen was in place and there was no disturbance of accumulated grime and insect traces. A sliding glass door in her parents' bedroom was also unlocked. No knives were found at the scene that seemed consistent with the murder weapon, and no bloody clothing was found despite an exhaustive search. Investigation All of the Crowe family members were questioned, their clothing was confiscated, and their bodies were examined for injuries. The parents were then put up in a motel, while the two surviving children were taken to the county's shelter for children, and were not allowed to see their parents for two days. During that time, police interviewed both children, unbeknownst to their parents. They took Michael Crowe, Stephanie's 14-year-old brother, away to the police station for questioning on several occasions. Michael Crowe became the police's main suspect for the murder. He was singled out by Escondido police because the crime scene seemed to suggest an inside job, and because he seemed \\"distant and preoccupied\\" after Stephanie's body was discovered and the rest of the family grieved. Police interrogated him multiple times without his parents' knowledge and without an attorney present. During the interrogations, police falsely informed him that they had found physical evidence implicating him, that he had failed an examination with a so-called \\"truth verification\\" device, and that his parents were convinced he had done it. After an intense 6-hour interrogation, he gave a vague confession to killing his sister, providing no details and saying that he couldn't remember doing it. The interview was videotaped by police; at times Michael is heard saying things to the effect of, \\"I'm only saying this because it's what you want to hear.\\" He was arrested and charged with murdering his sister. Police from Escondido and nearby Oceanside also questioned Joshua Treadway and Aaron Houser, two 15-year-old friends of Michael Crowe. Houser had a collection of knives; one of them was reported missing by Houser's parents. It turned up at Treadway's house; he said he had taken it from Houser. Police took Treadway to police headquarters and questioned him continuously for eleven hours from 9 p.m. that day until 8.a.m. the next, telling him that they believed his knife was the murder weapon. They interrogated him again two weeks later, a 10-hour interview during which Treadway gave a detailed confession to participating in the murder with the other two boys. Treadway was then arrested. Aaron Houser was then arrested and questioned. He did not actually confess and steadfastly denied any involvement, but he did present a \\"hypothetical\\" account of how the crime might have happened, under prompting by police interrogators using the Reid technique. All three boys subsequently recanted their statements claiming coercion. The majority of Michael Crowe's confession was later ruled as coerced by a judge because Escondido investigators implied to Michael that they would talk to the district attorney and recommend leniency. Treadway actually confessed twice, the first to Oceanside detectives and a second, identical confession, to Escondido officers. The court ruled that the two confessions were redundant and ordered that the first be suppressed. The second Treadway confession remains admissible. Houser's statements to police were suppressed because police did not sufficiently advise him of his Miranda rights. On the day the body was discovered, the police also interviewed Richard Raymond Tuite, a 28-year-old transient who had been seen in the Crowe's neighborhood on the night of the murder, knocking on doors and looking in windows, causing several neighbors to call police reporting a suspicious person. Tuite had a lengthy criminal record, habitually wandered the streets of Escondido, and had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Police questioned Tuite, confiscated his clothing, and noticed scrapes on his body and a cut on his hand. However, they did not consider him a suspect, since they considered him incapable of murder and they had already focused on Michael Crowe as their prime suspect. Legal proceedings The three teenage boys were charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. A judge ruled that they should be tried as adults. They were incarcerated for six months as prosecutors prepared to try them. However, as Treadway's trial was about to begin in January 1999, belated DNA testing found three drops of Stephanie's blood on a shirt belonging to Tuite. Based on the new evidence, the charges against the boys were dismissed without prejudice (which would allow charges to be reinstated against the boys at a later date). Embarrassed by the reversal, the Escondido police and the San Diego County District Attorney let the case languish without charges for two years. In 2001 the District Attorney and San Diego County Sheriff's Department asked that the case be taken over by the California Department of Justice. In May 2002 the Attorney General charged Tuite with murdering Stephanie. The trial began in February 2004. On the first day of jury selection, Tuite walked away from the courtroom holding-tank during the lunch hour after freeing himself from handcuffs; he left the courthouse and boarded a bus. He was caught hours later. At trial, the prosecution linked Tuite to Stephanie's killing by presenting both circumstantial and physical evidence, including evidence that Stephanie's blood was on his clothes. Tuite's defense team argued that the boys had killed Stephanie, and that Stephanie's blood was found on Tuite's clothes as a result of contamination caused by careless police work. On May 26, 2004, the jury acquitted Tuite of murder but convicted him of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The jury also found that he used a deadly weapon, a knife. The trial court sentenced Tuite to thirteen years in prison. He subsequently had four more years added onto the sentence due to his flight attempt. The families of all three boys sued the cities of Escondido and Oceanside. The Crowes reached a settlement of $7.25 million in 2011. In 2012, Superior Court Judge Kenneth So made the rare ruling that Michael Crowe, Treadway and Houser were factually innocent of the charges, permanently dismissing the criminal case against them. Tuite appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal and raised several claims, including a claim that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he was precluded from fully cross-examining a prosecution witness. On December 14, 2006, the Court of Appeal affirmed in a lengthy unpublished opinion.APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (PDF, 68 pages) , December 14, 2006 The court found that the trial judge had committed constitutional error in limiting the cross-examination, but held the error to be harmless and affirmed the conviction. The Supreme Court of California denied review. The federal district court denied Tuite's petition for habeas corpus.United States District Court - Tuite v. Martel - Order, June 30, 2009 On September 8, 2011, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit voted 2-1 to overturn Tuite's manslaughter conviction, ruling the trial was unfair because the trial judge limited cross-examination of a prosecution witness. The panel stated in its opinion, \\"Given the lack of evidence tying Tuite to the crime, the problems with the DNA evidence, the jury's deadlock and compromise verdict, and the weight and strategic position of McCrary's testimony, this case is one of those 'unusual' circumstances in which we find ourselves 'in virtual equipose as to the harmlessness of the error.' O'Neil v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 435 (1995). We must treat the error as affecting the verdict, and we are compelled to grant the writ.\\" Tuite v. Martel, No. 09-56267. It was noted that during the trial the prosecution could not produce any trace evidence of the house on the defendant's clothing or person nor was any trace evidence of the defendant's person or clothing found in the house, facts that the Court of Appeals cited which led to the Court's determination of lack of evidence. Tuite was granted a retrial, which began on October 24, 2013. In closing arguments, his attorney, Brad Patton, told jurors that Tuite had never been in the Crowe house, and wouldn't have been able to find Stephanie's bedroom in the dark home. In addition, investigators did not find his fingerprints or DNA in the residence. Patton said Stephanie must have been held down under a comforter to keep her quiet, while someone else stabbed her. He also said that experts testified that the blood stains on Tuite's shirts were not there when those shirts were originally evaluated, and got there through contamination during the crime scene analysis. The prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Alana Butler, said during her closing argument that Tuite was in the area of the Crowe home the night Stephanie was killed. He was knocking on doors and looking for a woman named Tracy, at whom he was angry because she had turned him away a couple of years earlier. He was \\"obsessed and delusional\\". Butler said Tuite wandered into the Crowe home at about 10 p.m. through an open door. Once he got in the house, she couldn't tell exactly what happened, but he went into Stephanie's bedroom and stabbed her at least nine times, and her blood was found on two shirts that he was wearing when contacted by police the next day. On December 5, 2013, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Afterwards, a juror said there was no evidence that Tuite was ever in the Crowe residence that night, and that the jurors were concerned that the victim's blood might have got onto his shirts through contamination, so they looked hard at that possibility. Impact * The attempted prosecution of the three boys was partially responsible for San Diego County District Attorney Paul Pfingst's loss to Bonnie Dumanis in the 2002 election. * A TV movie called The Interrogation of Michael Crowe was made about the case in 2002. * The 2003 book Who Killed Stephanie Crowe?, written by Paul E. Tracy, a criminology professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, in collaboration with two of the original detectives, raised questions about Tuite's guilt. * The 2006 book Shattered Justice: A Savage Murder and the Death of Three Families' Innocence by John Philpin focuses on the impact of the crime and the criminal charges on the three boys and their families.

In the following years, he built the house (1810), the lodge (1815) and the chapel (1829). Charles Baker was the son of a Chichester surgeon, and claimed descent from the Bakers of Mayfield, the great Sussex Ironmasters. The architect of the house is thought to have been James Elmes (1782‚Äì1862), who is known to have submitted a design for Oakwood, the house opposite Sennicotts, and who lived at Oving, West Sussex nearby. Elmes was a friend of Sir John Soane, and architectural features such as the entrance hall, which is cube shaped and has a ceiling of shallow ‚Äògroined‚Äô vaulting, is very similar to Soane‚Äôs drawing room at Aynhoe Park. The ends of the hall are in the form of shallow apses, with marbled niches, and below the bold cornice runs an egg-and-dart moulding. Both the drawing and dining rooms at Sennicotts have coved ceilings with a bead moulding on the ceiling flat, and an unusual leaf enriched torus moulding at the cornice. Charles Baker lived until 1839, when the estate passed to his nephew, Christopher Teesdale. The Teesdales did not inhabit the house, but continued to be buried in the family vault below the chapel, until it was made into a Church for this part of the extensive Parish of Funtington, following the sale of the rest of the estate in 1929. Between 1839 and 1929, the house was let to a succession of tenants, the most notable being Prince Louis of Battenberg, who had Sennicotts as his first home after his marriage in 1884. The house is mentioned in David Duff‚Äôs ‚ÄúHessian Tapestry‚Äù, and another book called ‚ÄúLouis and Victoria‚Äù, and in an earlier work on Prince Louis written by Mark Kerr, the Prince‚Äôs letter at the end of June 1885 says how sad he was to leave Sennicotts. The new owner in 1929 was William P. Wilson, who built the Music Room with a fine Venetian window at one end, a bow window at the side, and a shallow vaulted ceiling of the kind favoured by Repton, Soane and other Regency architects. After a period as 'Combined Operations' during the Second World War, the house was purchased by Captain Geoffrey Bowes-Lyon, first cousin of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. After his death in 1951, the house was occupied by his son, Major-General Sir James Bowes-Lyon, when not stationed in Germany. The house was sold to the late Mrs. Rowland Rank, sister-in-law of J Arthur Rank and daughter-in-law of Joseph Rank the flour miller, in 1961 and it remains in her family.

H. Richardson. The first building purposely built for an American law school, it was also the first dedicated home of Harvard Law School. It is located on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  Construction  The hall was built 1882‚Äì1884 in Romanesque Revival style. Single-story wings flank a heavy, two-story central mass, with the reading room extending rearwards to form an overall T shape. A central entryway framed with Romanesque triple arch is set deep within the building's flat front facade, with an asymmetric stairway tower protruding forwards to its right. The building is faced with Longmeadow sandstone in striking polychrome patterns, the light stones forming checkerboards within dark, reddish walls. The arches are of pale Ohio sandstone, as is the thick cornice band incised with a lengthy and sententious motto.  Design  Austin Hall's first floor contains three large classrooms; these were designed to complement the new law school curriculum that was being implemented at the time by Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell, including large core classes employing the Socratic method. As this curriculum has been imitated by other American law schools, so has the classroom layout first employed at Austin Hall. The building's second floor contains the Ames Courtroom, where students argue moot cases before panels of judges. A United States Supreme Court justice usually presides over the moot court's final round. The reading room's interior has been judged particularly fine for its ornamented fireplace and tie beams carved with the heads of dragons and boars.

Born in Pototan, Iloilo, Philippines, she retired from education and became a housewife shortly after her marriage to Alejandro Balderas, a wealthy landowner from Sara, Iloilo. When the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain broke out, she became one of only a few women to join the Panay-based Visayan arm of the Katipunan, the initially secret revolutionary society headed by Andr√©s Bonifacio. Despite opposition from her husband, Magbanua followed her two younger brothers and took up arms against the Spaniards, leading troops into combat and winning several battles under the command of General Martin Delgado. Magbanua is credited as the only woman to lead troops in the Visayan area during the Revolution. Shortly thereafter, Magbanua shifted to fighting American colonial forces during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War.. She is one of the few Filipinos to have participated in all three resistance movements against Spain (in the Philippine Revolution), the United States (in the Philippine-American War), and Japan (in World War II).  Early life  Magbanua's date of birth is variously reported as 13 October 1863, 13 October, 1868, or 4 November 1871. She was born in Pototan, Iloilo, Philippines, to affluent parents. Don Juan Magbanua, a judge, sat on the Court of First Instance in Iloilo City, while Do√±a Alejandra Ferraris was the daughter of Captain Benito Ferraris. Teresa was the Magbanua's second child, joining her sisters Mar√≠a and Paz, and younger brothers Manuel, Pascual and Elias. Magbanua was recorded to have been a precocious child, remembered by one of her sisters as a \\"dynamic personality, restless, and unafraid of any man.\\" Magbanua studied teaching in college, first at the Colegio de San Jos√© in Jaro, Iloilo, and later in Manila, where she studied at three different girls' schools: Colegio de Santa Rosa (1894), Santa Catalina College (1886), and Colegio de Do√±a Cecilia. She earned a teaching certificate at Colegio de Do√±a Cecilia in 1894 and a master's degree soon after from the University of Santo Tom√°s. She then returned home to Pototan and began teaching, where her students knew her as a disciplinarian. After four years of teaching in Pototan, Magbanua moved north to Sara, Iloilo, and became a schoolteacher there, meeting Alejandro Balderas whom she married in 1898. Balderas was a wealthy landowner, and after she married, Magbanua quit her teaching job and became a housewife. While working on her husband's lands, Magbanua learned how to shoot a pistol and ride a horse. Her horseback skills improved to the point that she would ride on horseback from Sara to her hometown of Pototan, a distance over rugged terrain. Philippine Revolution  War broke out between the Filipinos and Spanish in 1896, and Magbanua became a member of the Katipunan revolutionaries. While the Katipunan \\"largely excluded (women) from the revolutionary army\\", the movement also recognized the role women had played in the struggle against the Spanish, so much that the Katipunan organized a woman's chapter as early as 1893. In October 1898, the war entered Iloilo province and two of her brothers joined the revolutionary army. While Magbanua wanted to help out the war effort, her husband was against it. Magbanua didn't listen; however, and went to her uncle, Major General Perfecto Poblador, who commanded the Northern Zone at the time. Magbanua asked him to join the Army and who would later take charge of the Administrative Division. While hesitant at first, General Poblador eventually gave in to his niece and gave Magbanua command of a battalion of bolo troops. Magbanua fought in several key battles during the revolution. On 3 December 1898, her forces fought and defeated Spanish troops at the Battle of Barrio Yoting, which took place in Pilar, Capiz. She led her troops into this, her first battle, on horseback. Her efforts during the Battle of Barrio Yoting earned Magbanua the nickname \\"Visayan Joan of Arc\\". She was also affectionately known among her troops as \\"Nanay Isa\\" or \\"'Nay Isa\\" (Nanay being the Visayan word of \\"mother\\", and \\"Isa\\" a shortening of her name.) On 3 December 1898. Magbanua lead her troops against Spanish forces at the Battle of Sapong Hills near Sara. Magbanua prevailed, despite the odds being heavily in favor of the Spanish. After these battles, Magbanua's forces were joined by revolutionary forces from Antique, under the command of General Leandro Fullon, for a march on Iloilo City. On 24 December 1898, Magbanua participated in the liberation of Iloilo City, alongside Generals Martin Delgado, Roque Lopez, Quintin Salas and others. Along with the other generals, Magbanua helped circle Iloilo City, allowing General Delgado to enter and retake the city from the Spanish. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War  During the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Magbanua participated in several battles against American forces, as did her brothers. Her brothers were both ranking officers‚ÄîPascual was a general while Elias was a major. On 11 February 1899, Magbanua fought in the Battle of Iloilo City. Along with General Martin Delgado, Magbanua defended Iloilo City against the advancing forces of Brigadier General Marcus Miller. This battle ended in defeat for Magbanua and Delgado, as American forces took Iloilo without a single reported casualty. On 10 March 1899, Magbanua participated in the Battle of Balantang, Jaro, along with her brother Pascual. This battle resulted in Philippine forces retaking Jaro from the Americans. For her valor, Magbanua was given a prominent place in the celebration that followed, and led her troops into the city while riding a white horse. Also in 1899, Magbanua participated in the defense of the Balantang-Tacas-Jiabo-an line. The celebrations would not last long, and Magbanua soon suffered personal tragedy. General Pascual Magbanua died in December 1899 at the age of 24, under mysterious circumstances. Her other brother, Major Elias Magbanua, also died mysteriously at the age of 19, and both deaths dealt a blow to Magbanua. She began using guerrilla tactics after the Filipino's regional headquarters in Santa Barbara fell to the Americans. She surrendered her troops to the American forces in 1900 and returned to farming. There is no official record that proves Magbanua was a commissioned officer; however, she is referred to by the honorific \\"general\\" in many texts.  Later life  While not an active fighter during World War II, Magbanua did what she could to resist Japanese forces during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. She sold her personal belongings to purchase food and supplies, which she would then give to the local guerrillas. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, her husband Alejandro Balderas died and Magbanua sold her property in Iloilo to help finance the guerrillas.  Death  Magbanua moved to Pagadian, Zamboanga in Mindanao, after the end of World War II and lived there with her sister Maria. She never remarried after Baldaras' death, and their marriage produced no children. Magbanua died on an unknown date in August 1947. Her burial was attended only by her close friends; there were no announcements made of her death at the time.  Legacy  While not as well known as her brothers, Magbanua was recognized for her courage and service. There are streets named after Magbanua in Pototan and Iloilo City. Several awards are also given out in her name, including the Gawad Teresa Magbanua Award given to teachers in Davao, and the Teresa Magbanua award for women's and children's rights given to Ilonggos in Iloilo. October 13 is officially Teresa Magbanua Day in Pototan; it was first observed in 2006.

She acts as a foil to Mirah Lapidoth. Biography Gwendolen Harleth is beautiful and wilful, desired by many men, a fact which she revels in. However, her family falls on hard times soon after the novel begins. It becomes the once proud Gwendolen's fate to have to work as a governess in order to support herself and her family. She desperately tries to escape that fate, and explores the possibility of working on the stage as an actress. She is sorely disabused of that notion, when she learns that beauty and charm alone are not enough to gain her followers on the stage--it requires years of training and hard work. Unable to bear the idea of being a governess, Gwendolen decides to marry the abusive, authoritarian Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt‚Äîthough she had promised his mistress, Lydia Glasher, that she would not do so, since that would disinherit the children Glasher has with Grandcourt. Glasher had previously left her husband for Grandcourt, and had also been given promises of marriage, but he has never kept his word. Eliot says of Gwendolen, \\"It was not that she wished to damage men, it was only that she wished not to be damaged by them.\\" Gwendolen and Grandcourt have an unhappy marriage, and Gwendolen is racked by guilt when Grandcourt drowns, as she had been wishing for him to die and hesitated for a moment before trying to save him. Grandcourt had recently made a new will, in which he left the majority of his fortune and estates to his son by Mrs. Glasher, if his marriage to Gwendolen did not produce a male heir. He created the new will specifically in an effort to coerce Gwendolen to do her wifely duty with him to produce a legitimate heir. Throughout her ordeals, Daniel Deronda acts as a moral guide. He buys back jewellery she has pawned when she becomes impoverished, and he counsels her when she is distressed about the state of her marriage to Grandcourt and her actions vis a vis Lydia Glasher and her children. When she is uncertain what to do when she is widowed, he encourages her to do good. Onscreen portrayals Daniel Deronda has been adapted for the screen twice. The first time, in 1921, Gwendolen was played by Dorothy Fane. The second, better-known version, a BBC serialisation from 2002, had Romola Garai as Gwendolen.

He had substantial land holdings in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Following his participation in the Norman Invasion of Ireland, he was granted, in 1172, the lands of the Kingdom of Meath by the Anglo-Norman King Henry II, but he had to gain control of them. The Lordship of Meath was then the most extensive liberty in Ireland. Early life Hugh de Lacy was the son of Gilbert de Lacy (died after 1163) of Ewyas Lacy, Weobley, and Ludlow. He is said to have had a dispute with Joscelin de Dinan as to certain lands in Herefordshire in 1154. He was in possession of his father's lands before 1163, and in 1165‚Äì66 held fifty-eight and three-quarters knights' fees, and had nine tenants without knight service. Career in Ireland The keep of Trim Castle Kilkea Castle (Front) Motte-and- bailey built by de Lacy at Clonard, County Meath In October 1171 Lacy went over with Henry II as part of an Anglo-Norman force to invade Ireland, and early in 1172 he was sent to receive the submission of Rory, High King of Ireland. Before Henry's return to England about the end of March 1172, Lacy was granted Meath by the service of fifty knights and with almost royal authority; he was also put in charge of Dublin Castle. As such, it is generally accepted that Lacy was de facto the first Viceroy of Ireland, a position he was to hold three times (in 1172, 1179, and ), the third time jointly with the Bishop of Salisbury. King Henry's ostensible grant of Meath to Lacy was not accepted by Tighearn√°n √ì Ruairc, King of Br√©ifne, who ruled it at that time. √ì Ruairc refused to concede, but parleyed with Lacy on the Hill of Ward, in Meath. After negotiations stalled, a dispute ensued in which an interpreter was killed by a blow aimed at Lacy, who fled; √ì Ruairc was killed by a spear-thrust as he mounted his horse, and he was decapitated. His head was impaled over the gate of Dublin Castle and was later sent to Henry II. The Annals of the Four Masters say that √ì Ruairc was treacherously slain. From the account given by Giraldus Cambrensis, it would appear that there was a plot to destroy √ì Ruairc.DESMOND CASTLE AND RATH, LIMERICK. CHAPTER XIV. The Monk Gerald of Wales related the following legend of F√©ch√≠n and Hugh de Lacy: \\" Chapter LII (Of the mill which no women enter) *\\"There is a mill at Foure, in Meath, which St. Fechin made most miraculously with his own hands, in the side of a certain rock. No women are allowed to enter either this mill or the church of the saint; and the mill is held in as much reverence by the natives as any of the churches dedicated to the saint. It happened that when Hugh de Lacy was leading his troops through this place, an archer dragged a girl into the mill and there violated her. Sudden punishment overtook him; for being struck with infernal fire in the offending parts, it spread throughout his whole body, and he died the same night\\". Lordship of Meath Lacy only escaped from Dublin with difficulty; he seems to have left the city in the charge of Richard de Clare by the king's orders, and to have commenced securing Meath by the construction of castles. Among these was Trim Castle, which was put in charge of Hugh Tyrrel. The Song of Dermot and the Earl states, \\"And Skryne he then gave by charter to Adam de Feypo he gave it\\", and he built his castle there. After this Lacy went back to England. On 29 December 1172 he was at Canterbury, where, according to a story preserved by Giraldus, he reproved Archbishop Richard of Dover for his boastful language. Next year he was fighting for King Henry in France and held Verneuil against Louis VII for a month; but at the end of that time the town was forced to capitulate. Lacy was sent back to Ireland as procurator-general in 1177, soon after the death of Richard de Clare. The grant of Meath to Lacy was now confirmed, with the addition of Offelana, Offaly, Kildare, and Wicklow. As governor of Ireland Lacy secured Leinster and Meath, building numerous castles, while leaving the Irish in possession of their lands. There were accusations that he intended to seize the sovereignty of the island for himself. The author of the Gesta Henrici, however, says that Lacy lost his favour with Henry in consequence of complaints of his injustice by the Irish. In 1181, Lacy was recalled from his royal post for having married the daughter of Ruadri O Conchobair, King of Connaught and deposed High King of Ireland, without the permission of Henry. He was sent back the following winter, although with a co-adjutor, Robert of Shrewsbury, one of the royal clerks. Early in 1185 Henry sent his son John over to Ireland, and the young prince complained to his father that Lacy would not permit the Irish to pay tribute. This led to fresh disgrace, but Lacy remained in Ireland and occupied himself as before with castle-building. Death, aftermath and legacy In 1186 Hugh de Lacy was killed by Gilla-Gan-Mathiar O'Maidhaigh, while he was supervising the construction of a Motte castle at Durrow at the instigation of An tSionnach and O'Breen.Annals of the Four Masters, 1186.5 Prince John was promptly sent over to Ireland to take possession of his lands. Lacy's body was initially buried at Durrow Abbey. In 1195, the Archbishops of Cashel and Dublin disinterred his body and reinterred his remains at Bective Abbey in Meath and his head in St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin. A long controversy was then carried on between the two abbeys for his body, settled only in 1205 when it was disinterred again and reburied in St Thomas's Abbey, in the tomb of Lacy's first wife. Lacy was a benefactor of Llanthony Priory and also of many churches in Ireland, including the abbey of Trim. Marriage and Issue Hugh de Lacy was married twice. Before 1155 Hugh married Rohese of Monmouth (also known as Rose of Monmouth or Roysya de Monemue). She was the granddaughter of Gilbert Fitz Richard. Strongbow was the grandson of Fitz Richard. Hugh and Rohese had at least 8 children, 4 sons and 4 daughters: * Walter de Lacy (1166‚Äì1241) * Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster (bef.1179‚Äì1242) * Gilbert de Lacy * Robert de Lacy (died young).

Arriving on 22 June 1945 she served as a training ship for pre-commissioning crews until 30 July. Guilford then took on board cargo and troops at Norfolk, Virginia and sailed for the Pacific via San Diego. After off-loading troops at Iwo Jima and in the Japanese home islands, Guilford was attached to \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" on 18 October. In two round trips from San Diego to Guam, Saipan, Okinawa, and Japan, she transported over 5,000 veterans back to the United States for discharge as well as carrying out troops for the occupation of Japan. Returning to San Diego on 6 March 1946 from her final Pacific voyage, Guilford embarked passengers for the East Coast and sailed for Norfolk via the Panama Canal on 15 March.

Graphesthesia tests combined cortical sensation; therefore, it is necessary that primary sensation be intact.Blumenfeld, H. (2010). 'Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases' (2nd Edition ed.). Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates Inc. During medical or neurological examination graphesthesia is tested in order to test for certain neurological conditions such as; lesions in brainstem, spinal cord, sensory cortex or thalamus. An examiner writes single numbers or simple letters on the skin (usually the palm) with something that will provide a clear stimulus, such as a broken tongue depressor, pen cap etc. Prior to the start of testing, an agreement may be reached between the examiner and the patient as to the orientation of the letters, although this is often unnecessary, since orientation and size of the figures are rarely an issue. The crucial aspect of testing graphesthesia, as with any sensory testing, is to establish that the patient understands the test, hence the test is commenced, in the hemiplegic patient, on the normal, intact hand. This also allows the examiner to establish the patient's numeracy, since semi-numerate patients may have difficulties performing the task. The patient provides a verbal response identifying the figure that was drawn. If the patient has a speech or language impairment that prevents them from verbalizing an answer, the answer can be selected from a series of images shown to them.O'Sullivan, S. B., & Schmitz, T. J. (2007). 'Physical Rehabilitation' (5th Edition ed.). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company. Loss of graphesthesia indicates either parietal lobe damage on the side opposite the hand tested or damage to the dorsal columns pathway at any point between the tested point and the contralateral parietal lobe. The major clinical utility of the test in the 21st century is in the condition, cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration, where, in addition to evidence of basal ganglia dysfunction, the presence of cortical sensory loss is likely to have reasonably high specificity for the diagnosis. Testing graphesthesia can be substituted for stereognosis if a patient is unable to grasp an object. Graphesthesia can be considered as a type of synthetic sensation as it involves a complex interaction between three neural components i.e. Tactile sensation, two point discrimination and cortical component that stores infirmation about the symbol/letter that is being traced in the skin and was learned through some previous experience.

Founded in 1904, the club won the Dutch national football title in 1949. In 1991, the professional branch of SVV and neighbouring Dordrecht'90 merged to form FC Dordrecht. SVV continues to play in amateur leagues. History The club was founded in 1904 as Excelsior, which was renamed to Voorwaarts (Forward) two years later. The name was again changed, to SVV this time, when the club entered the Dutch national football competition. SVV was a people's club, and its players came mostly from the local residential area De Gorzen. SVV won promotion to the Eerste Klasse, the highest national division at the time, in 1948. The first season at that level immediately saw the club winning the title. This allowed SVV to face other Eerste Klasse champions for the national title. The decisive match was played in Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam, on June 4, 1949. 69,300 Spectators saw SVV beat SC Heerenveen 3‚Äì1, making the club the national football champions 1948‚Äì1949. Among the players of this team were Jan van Schijndel, Frans Steenbergen, Jan Schrumpf, Arij de Bruijn, Henk K√∂nemann and Rinus Gosens. The national title would remain the club's only success. When professional football was introduced, SVV was one of the original teams of the Eredivisie. The club was relegated to the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of football in the Netherlands, two years later. The club was relegated to the Tweede Divisie in 1962 and won promotion there in 1966. Three seasons later, in 1969, SVV won the Eerste Divisie title, giving them promotion to the Eredivisie. The manager of that team was Rinus Gosens, who was a player when SVV won the national title in 1949. The club was relegated again after only one season and would spend the following nineteen seasons in the Eerste Divisie. Near bankruptcy and merger SVV appeared to go bankrupt in 1988, but local car salesman John van Dijk rescued the club. Wim Jansen became technical director, Dick Advocaat was appointed manager. The club won the Eerste Divisie title in 1990, and clinched promotion to the Eredivisie. As a part of the rescue, Van Dijk bought valuable players like Joop Hiele and Winston Bogarde. Because the stadium in Schiedam was deemed inappropriate for high-profile games, the club played such matches in the Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam. When the stadium couldn't be renovated, Van Dijk decided to merge SVV with Dordrecht'90, from neighbouring Dordrecht. The new club, called SVV/Dordrecht'90, played in the Eredivisie. Its home turf was the stadium of Dordrecht '90 in Dordrecht. The club's name was changed to Dordrecht'90 in 1992, and to FC Dordrecht in 2002. SVV/SMC After the merger, SVV continued as an amateur club. In 1997, SVV merged with SMC to form SVVSMC. It reverted to its historical name in 2012.

He was a prolific writer whose best-known work was the Emphasized Bible, a new translation that used \\"emphatic inversion\\" and a set of diacritical marks to bring out shades of meaning in the original text. Life Rotherham was born at New Buckenham, Norfolk in the United Kingdom. His father was a Methodist preacher, and Rotherham followed in his footsteps, pastoring churches in Woolwich, Charlton and Stockton-on-Tees. However he soon developed differences with Methodism regarding infant baptism and, at the same time, became interested in the writings of the American preacher Alexander Campbell, one of the early leaders of the Restoration Movement. Rotherham eventually joined the movement in 1854 and became a well-known evangelist and biblical scholar with the Churches of Christ. During the 1860s Rotherham began work on a translation of the Bible in which he tried: This he proposed to do by giving \\"special heed to the Greek Article, to the Tenses, and to the Logical Idiom of the Original.\\" In 1872 his New Testament Critically Emphasised was published, with the Old Testament appearing in 1902. During this interval great advances occurred in textual criticism culminating at the end of the 19th century with Brooke Foss Westcott's and Fenton John Anthony Hort's Greek text of the New Testament. This led Rotherham to revise his New Testament twice to stay abreast of scholarly developments. He based his Old Testament translation on the comprehensive Hebrew text of Dr. C. D Ginsburg, which anticipated readings now widely accepted. Rotherham became an editor with James Sangster and Co., London in 1868, and then a Press Corrector for 31 years beginning in 1874, principally working with religious books. Although this effectively ended his Evangelistic work, he continued preaching and publishing articles in such magazines as Christian Commonwealth and Public Opinion, focusing particularly on scholarly issues such as the translation of the Revised Version. From 1885 to 1887 he was also editor of The Rainbow, a monthly magazine of Christian literature. Rotherham was a friend of several prominent Christian leaders of his day, including G. Campbell Morgan and C.H. Spurgeon. Death Rotherham enjoyed good health virtually to the end of his life, giving his last sermon on December 19, 1909. However on New Year's Day 1910 he caught a severe cold and experienced a rapid decline, dying only a few days later at the age of 81. His body was laid to rest in Hither Green Cemetery on January 10, with an evening service, including an address given by the Old Testament scholar J. W.

The track was his contribution to the soundtrack of the film Lethal Weapon 2 and was also issued as a single. Harrison wrote the song with Tom Petty and co-produced the recording with Jeff Lynne. The song has appeared on the Harrison compilation albums Best of Dark Horse and Let It Roll. A live version recorded with Eric Clapton was included on Harrison's 1992 album Live in Japan. Composition and recording The title of the song is attributed to Harrison's wife Olivia, who would tell her husband, \\"Okay, cheer down, big fellow\\" when he became too enthusiastic. Harrison first recorded a rhythm track for the song during the sessions for his 1987 album Cloud Nine. He subsequently finished the lyrics with assistance from Tom Petty. The following year, along with \\"Run So Far\\" and \\"That Kind of Woman\\", \\"Cheer Down\\" was among the four compositions that Harrison offered to Eric Clapton for inclusion on the latter's album Journeyman. Clapton instead decided to use it for the soundtrack to the film Lethal Weapon 2, which he had been commissioned to supply, but he persuaded Harrison to contribute his own recording for inclusion in the film. Harrison completed \\"Cheer Down\\" at his home studio, FPSHOT, in March 1989. The song was again co-produced by Jeff Lynne, who had served the same role on Cloud Nine, in addition to forming the Traveling Wilburys with Harrison and Petty. The completed recording features a long closing slide guitar solo that author Simon Leng admires for its fluency and variation. In Leng's description, during this section, Harrison's playing \\"runs the gamut from Indian blues chops to two-part countermelodies and sweeping Pete Drake jaunts through the octaves\\".

It was then issued as the opening track on the accompanying soundtrack album, released on 10 August 1989 in the United States, and as a single to promote the film there, on 22 August. Issued on Warner Bros. Records, the single's B-side was \\"That's What It Takes\\", a track from Cloud Nine. The UK release, which took place on 27 November, on Harrison's Warner-distributed Dark Horse record label, instead used the newly recorded \\"Poor Little Girl\\" as the B-side. The single was the last such release by Harrison as a solo artist during his lifetime. In October 1989, \\"Cheer Down\\" was included on Harrison's Dark Horse Records compilation album Best of Dark Horse 1976‚Äì1989, as the final track. Although Best of Dark Horse is no longer in print, \\"Cheer Down\\" was included on the 2009 career- spanning compilation Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison. It also appeared on the reissued soundtrack album in 2013, as part of a box set titled Lethal Weapon Soundtrack Collection. Live version Harrison performed \\"Cheer Down\\" throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Clapton, which was Harrison's first tour since 1974. \\"Cheer Down\\" was the most recent song included in Harrison's set list; in addition, it was one of the few selections to showcase his slide guitar playing, since otherwise he delegated his slide parts to Clapton's guitarist, Andy Fairweather-Low. During the concerts, Harrison took to introducing it as a song from the musical South Pacific. A version recorded on 15 December 1991 at the Tokyo Dome appears on Harrison's 1992 double album Live in Japan. He also performed it at the Natural Law Party Concert, held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 6 April 1992. For this performance ‚Äì which was Harrison's only full-length concert as a solo artist in Britain ‚Äì Petty's lead guitarist in the Heartbreakers, Mike Campbell, replaced Clapton. American dobro player Rainer Ptacek performed \\"Cheer Down\\" in 1997. Along with a version of Harrison's Beatles track \\"Within You Without You\\", the song was issued on Ptacek's 2001 album Live at the Performance Center. Track listings * US (Warner Bros.

The shell casing was molded from cast iron and formed into a pineapple-shaped oval, typical of World War I and II-era hand grenades. The grenade was modelled after earlier Polish grenades of the 1920s (such as the Defensive grenade wz.24), which in turn were based on French World War I F1 grenade. It was fitted with wz.Gr.31 percussion fuse. To increase reliability, the grenade had two blasting caps and two strikers. The casing was produced in one of three factories, a letter on the casing denoting the producer (\\"K\\" for Ko≈Ñskie, \\"M\\" for Warsaw and \\"W\\" for Wilno). The Polish name for the grenade was because the blast radius of fragments often exceeded 100 metres and the grenade had to be thrown from a defensive position, such as a trench or from behind a wall. Two such grenades as well as two wz.24 offensive grenades were standard military equipment for all enlisted soldiers.  Development history  The wz. 33 grenade was basically a development of earlier Polish grenades. The earliest of them, the Granat obronny wz. 23, was loosely based on the Mills bomb, the iconic fragmentation grenade of World War I that influenced a number of designs used by both the Central Powers and the Entente, notably the French F1 grenade. After 1918 Poland inherited over 3,380,000 grenades of various types and during the Polish-Bolshevist War of 1920 bought several million more. Because of large stocks, it was decided to focus early modernisation efforts at developing a new fuse rather than design the entire grenade for indigenous production. This was considered a logical choice as a number of Polish companies inherited production lines of German World War I grenade designs. In 1923 the Department of Arms started a competition for a new fuse that would fit the German M16 and M17 Stielhandgranate hand grenades, the predecessor of the iconic Model 24 . A completely new design by A. Cierpi≈Ñski of the Kielce-based Granat company was chosen and introduced as A.C. 23. However, as the field tests proved that the A.C. 23 was prone to malfunction in moist conditions, the Department started a new competition in 1925, again won by Cierpi≈Ñski's design (A.C. 25). The A.C. 23 and 25 became the standard fuse of Polish grenades: Granat obronny wz. 23 used the A.C. 25 while granat obronny wz. 17-1 (a Polish clone of the German M17 egg grenade) used the A.C. 23 variant. The Granat company continued to develop the fuse and in 1929 presented the armed forces with a time fuse code-named Gr 29 based on earlier projects by Cierpi≈Ñski. It was accepted as the standard fuse for the new Granat obronny wz. KC defensive grenade. Eventually the line of fuses led to the final design accepted into Polish service as Zapalnik wz. Gr. 31 (\\"Fuse Mark 1931, Granat factory\\"). The wz. 31 fuse was considered among the best in the world, soon after its adoption by the Polish Army; both France and Romania bought a license for their production. Initially France bought 310,000 wz. 31 fuses in 1935 and two years later bought a license and adopted it as the standard fuse for all defensive grenades of the French Army. Another country to adopt the fuse (in 1931) was Greece.

After being the executive director of Harry Truman's 1948 presidential campaign, Hedgeman was rewarded with a federal appointment in the Health, Education, and Welfare Department in the new president's administration. She was also appointed to the cabinet of New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., becoming the first African American woman to hold a cabinet post in New York. Hedgeman was a major advocate for both minorities and the poor in New York City. She also served as a consultant for many companies and entities on racial issues, and late in her life founded Hedgeman Consultant Services. She was among the organizers of the 1963 March on Washington. Throughout her many years involved in the civil rights movement, she befriended Dorothy Height. Early life and family Anna Arnold was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, to William James Arnold II and Marie Ellen (Parker) Arnold. She moved with her family to Anoka, Minnesota, where her family was the only African American one in the small town. However, her family was an active part of the community and she was never made to feel different while growing up. The Methodist Church and school were both vital parts of the Arnold family‚Äôs life. Her father created an encouraging environment that stressed education and a strong work ethic. Hedgeman learned how to read at home but was not permitted to attend school until she was seven years old. In 1918, Hedgeman graduated from high school and continued her education at Hamline University, a Methodist College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. She was the college‚Äôs first African-American student. In 1922, Hedgeman became the first African-American graduate, having earned a B.A. degree in English. While in college, she heard W. E. B. Du Bois speak, which inspired her to succeed as an educator. In 1936, she married Merritt Hedgeman, an interpreter of African-American folk music and opera, in New York City. The couple had no children. Pre-political career For two years, Hedgeman taught English and History at Rust College, a historically black college in Holly Springs, Mississippi, where she had her first experience with segregation. Anna Arnold Hedgeman began work in the community in the 1920s when she became executive director of a black branch of the YWCA in Jersey City, New Jersey. She worked for the YWCA as an executive director in Ohio, New Jersey, Harlem, Philadelphia, and Brooklyn. All of these branches were segregated. Hedgeman also served as the executive director of the National Committee for a Permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission, Assistant Dean of Women at Howard University, associate editor for the New York Age, a consultant for the public relations department of Fuller Products Company, and on Harry Truman's 1948 presidential campaign. Civil rights activism Throughout the 1930s, Hedgeman remained active in protest activities, her militancy resulting in a forced resignation from the directorship of the black branch of the Brooklyn YWCA. In 1944, she became the executive secretary of the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). In 1946, Hedgeman served as assistant dean of women at Howard University. In 1954, she became the first African American woman to hold a mayoral cabinet position in the history of New York City. In 1958, she held a position as a public relations consultant in Fuller Products Company. She became an associate editor and columnist for New York Age in 1959. In later years, she founded Hedgeman Consultant Services in New York City, with her husband. In 1963, Hedgeman was an organizer of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. She worked alongside activists such as Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph. This movement brought over 250,000 activists to Washington, D.C. Hedgeman individually recruited 40,000 Protestants to participate. In 1966 she became a co-founder of the National Organization for Women. Hedgeman served as teacher, lecturer, and consultant to numerous educational centers, boards, and colleges and universities, particularly in the area of African- American studies. She traveled to Africa and lectured throughout the United States, especially in black schools and colleges, as an example of a black hero. She stressed to students the importance of understanding history as a basis to achieve equality. In the 1970s, she frequently spoke at colleges in both Africa and the United States of America. Hedgeman held memberships in numerous organizations, such as the Child Study Association, Community Council of the City of New York, National Urban League, NAACP, United Nations Association, Advisory Committee on Alcoholism, Advisory Committee on Drug Addiction, and the National Conference of Christians and Jews. In 1963, she began serving as Coordinator of Special Events for the Commission of Religion and Race of the National Council of Churches. She used this role to communicate to white Christians about why racism went against their religion. This was also the mode through which she recruited 40,000 Protestants to participate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. She retired from the NCC in 1967. Hedgeman was the author of The Trumpet Sounds (1964), The Gift of Chaos (1977), and articles in numerous organizational publications, newspapers, and journals. Political career Hedgeman became a consultant on racial problems for New York City's Department of Welfare during the Great Depression, during which time it was called the Emergency Relief Bureau. In this role she investigated major racial issues, including the continuation of underground slavery through the Bronx Slave Markets, as well as studying the living conditions of minorities and encouraging civil service appointments for these under-represented citizens. In 1957, Anna Arnold Hedgeman became the first woman to serve on the cabinet of a New York City mayor, serving for one term under Robert F. Wagner, Jr. Following an acclaimed swearing in at city hall, it appeared that the mayor had no intention of employing Hedgeman to any position. She responded by assembling allies throughout the African American press, in order to put Wagner's potential reneging under the public eye. This was a great success, and Hedgeman received her spot on the cabinet, although she was put in a basement office. In this role, she served as an intermediary between Harlem and city hall. She also attended events for the mayor as his stand in when he could not make an appearance. In 1960, Hedgeman planned to run for United States Congress. She also had an unsuccessful race for City Council President in New York City. Honors and awards Hedgeman was a recipient of the Pioneer Woman Award, awarded by the New York State Conference on Midlife and Older Woman in 1983. Hedgeman received an Extraordinary Woman of Achievement Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. She was also granted honorary doctor degrees by Howard University and Hamline University. Hedgeman's portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.  Death  After her husband died in 1987, Hedgeman moved to the Greater Harlem Nursing Home in Harlem. She died on January 17, 1990, in Harlem Hospital at age 90.

Whilst playing for Gillingham he set a record for the lowest number of goals conceded in a 46-match season in the Football League, when he let in just 20 goals in the 1995‚Äì96 season. Until 18 January 2013, he was first-team goalkeeping coach at Southampton. Stannard is currently the first team goalkeeper coach for Bromley. Playing career Having previously played for non-league Ford United (now Redbridge), Stannard began his professional career with Fulham making his debut against Swindon Town in 1981 (keeping a clean sheet), but managed only 41 Football League appearances for the Craven Cottage club in his first five years, during which he was loaned out to Southend United and Charlton Athletic. In 1985 Southend signed him on a permanent basis and he made over 100 appearances before being sold back to Fulham in 1987. For the next eight years he was Fulham's first-choice keeper. He was affectionately known by Fulham supporters as \\"He's fat, he's round, he's worth a million pounds\\" or \\"He's fat, he's round, he can't get off the ground\\". But Stannard never played against many top English teams as his term was during a time when Fulham were in the lower divisions of the Football League. In 1995 manager Tony Pulis made him one of his first signings for Gillingham and, despite the fans' initial reservations about his age and burly build, Stannard proved instrumental in the Kent club's promotion from Division Three as he let in just 20 goals all season, a record for a 46-match league season. He also kept 29 clean sheets. Stannard retired in 1999, but came out of retirement to sign for Division Two side Brentford on a non-contract basis in 2003, backing up Alan Julian for two matches during the early months of the 2003‚Äì04 season.

The three adjacent corners of Beltline and Plano Road were also occupied by shopping centers. Richardson Square Mall demolition began in June 2007. Now located in its place is an outdoor retail center that goes by the name Richardson Square. The retail center includes Super Target with a Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express inside, Ross Dress for Less, Shoe Carnival, and a Lowe's home improvement store. The center also includes pad sites such as Panda Express, Chick-fil-A, Whataburger, Sonic Drive-In, and Bank of America. History The 139,000 square foot Sears building opened on March 6, 1974 before the mall existed and operated as a standalone store. Richardson Square Mall opened in 1977 along Plano Road with Sears being one of the four anchors along with Montgomery Ward, Dillard's, and Titche-Goettinger (which became Joske's in 1979). While the mall and Sears were single-level, the othe three anchor locations were each two stories. During its peak in the 1980s, the mall included the Richardson Square I-II-III movie theater (owned by General Cinema), a video arcade across from it, two bookstores (Waldenbooks and B. Dalton), and two music stores (Musicland and Camelot Music). Food vendors were grouped in the entrance corridors at each end of the mall‚Äìby Sears and Montgomery Ward‚Äìand included Chick-fil-A, Orange Julius, Hot Sam Pretzels, Bresler's Ice Cream, and Karmelkorn. The mall was closed on Sundays until September 1, 1985, when the Texas blue law was repealed. In 1981, the much larger Collin Creek Mall opened in nearby Plano, but Richardson Square continued to be popular and fully occupied throughout the remainder of the 1980s. A free-standing strip of stores was built in 1984-85 on the outer corner of the property closest to Lloyd V. Berkner High School. Tenants included a realtor and dry cleaning business, but most of the stores were never leased. In 1987, the Joske's chain was purchased by Dillard's, and the Joske's location in the mall became a second Dillard's. Dillard's maintained both its store and the former Joske's location, which it would close in 1995. Decline Stores began rapidly closing in the early 1990s. By 1993, the property was at about 60% occupancy. A new tenant during this phase was French bakery Cafe Partier. In 1998, the mall was remodeled, with many new tenants and a food court added, as well as a Barnes & Noble bookstore which occupied the space of half a dozen stores. The entrance corridor near Sears, formerly occupied by a movie theater, video arcade, and several food vendors, became a Stein Mart. Shortly thereafter Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and closed its stores. The former Ward's pad was demolished and converted into a Super Target in 2002. Stein Mart, Oshman's, and several other small stores soon closed as well. The mall continued to operate until Garland's Firewheel Town Center opened in 2005. Dillard's, Old Navy, and Barnes & Noble all relocated to Firewheel. Richardson Square Mall was demolished in mid 2007, except for Sears, which remained in operation as part of the subsequent Richardson Square retail center. The loss of the mall was significant for the city, but, in 2006, with the announcement that Simon Properties would be renovating the site, city leaders expressed optimism that the new development would flourish.Action Newsletter On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide. The store closed on March 10, 2019.

He works in the field of editorial, graphic, and type design, teaches typeface design at the postgraduate course Type&Media; at the KABK, Royal Academy of Art (The Hague).[1] Royal Academy of Art in The Hague He started Typotheque in 1999, Dot Dot Dot in 2000 (with Stuart Bailey), Indian Type Foundry in 2009, Works That Work magazine in 2012, and Fontstand, in 2015. He is a member of AGI (Alliance Graphique Internationale.[2] Peter Bilak at AGI) and lectures on his work internationally. He is a writer for numerous design magazines and frequently contributes writing and design to books and publications that include Print, Emigre, Eye (magazine), Items, tipoGrafica, Idea (magazine), Abitare and Page. He has designed several fonts including FF Eureka (published by Fontshop) and Fedra (published by his own type foundry Typotheque). He works on a broad range of cultural and commercial projects and his interest in each discipline extends beyond the practise of design to the inquisitive exploration of it.  Early life  Biƒæak was born in Czechoslovakia. He started art at the Art Academy in Bratislava, then studied briefly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Later, he went to Atelier National de Cr√©ation Typographique in Paris, where he obtained his Master's degree, and Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht, Netherlands for his postgraduate laureate. His biggest influences were the places he has lived. In school, he found out that many things he was taught in school turned out to be mainly false, and that it was easy is to manipulate information. Those places made him question what he already knew. Travelling during that time made him more independent and allowed him to see things from multiple perspectives. As a student in Czechoslovakia, Biƒæak was often frustrated by the fact that his language were not supported by most typefaces. He later went on to develop typefaces for Russian and Greek, however a significant achievement came with Arabic, which was a language he had no knowledge about. This began his type- designing career. During his studies, he had encountered people, whom he referred to as 'inspiring teachers' such as Irma Boom, Karel Martens, Armand Mevis, and Michael Rock.  Career  Biƒæak started his career with international design agency, Studio Dumbar in The Hague, where he worked between 1999 and 2001. After leaving Studio Dumbar, he started working independently. In 1999, Biƒæak established the type foundry Typotheque with the idea of \\"digging out all the projects from the drawers and publishing them.\\" Originally started with a single typeface, Typotheque has then published articles, book reviews and interviews with other designers, and quickly becoming a reference in the world of design and typography. In October 2009, Typotheque was the first type foundry to license its entire font collection for as webfonts. Typotheque's webfont service uses rule in CSS, and serves the appropriate font file to different browsers, from their network of distributed servers. Because of his interest in languages, he worked in 2007 with Indian designer Satya Rajpurohit on the Hindi version of Fedra Sans, and in 2009 started the Indian Type Foundry. Similar to Typotheque, ITF started out with a single typeface, but has larger plans to develop typefaces for all Indian writing scripts such as Devanagari, Tamil, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, etc. It also has plans to organise lectures and workshops in India, and to publish typefaces made by local designers. Prajavani, a major South Indian newspaper, has engaged the firm to create a custom typeface, something virtually unheard of in Indian publishing.[3] Print, June 2011, vol 65, issue 3, p.52 Since then, ITF has created fonts for multinationals such as Google, Apple, Sony, Samsung, Amazon, amongst others. For his contribution to the non- Latin typography, he was named in 2012 one of the 12 Game Changers by Metropolis.[4] Metropolis Magazine: Peter Bilak, Game Changer In 2014, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic awarded Biƒæak the Goodwill Envoy award [5] Minister Lajƒç√°k presented Goodwill Envoy awards for the successful spreading of the country Slovakia. Together with Kristyan Sarkis, a Lebanese designer based in the Netherlands, Biƒæak has co-founded TPTQ Arabic, a sister company that develops original Arabic typefaces and systems for bilingual typography.[6] Announcement TPTQ Arabic, October 15, 2015 In 2015, Peter Biƒæak, together with Andrej Kr√°tky co- founded Fontstand, a desktop app that allows trying fonts for free or renting them per month, also referred to as the \\"iTunes for Fonts\\".[7] This New Service Wants to Be the iTunes for Fonts Fontstand has been included[8] The New Europe 100, Fontstand founders in the New Europe 100, a list of Central and Eastern Europe innovations that recognises those who expertise in emerging technologies, unique skills and social outreach which have had a global impact. New Europe 100 is organised by Res Publica together with Google, the Visegrad Fund, and in cooperation with the Financial Times.[9] The 2015 New Europe 100: sectors in the vanguard of change In 2019 he was awarded the Gold Prize in the European Design Awards for his font \\"Ping\\", a truly international typeface, supporting not only hundreds of Latin-based languages, but also Arabic, Armenian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Korean, Hebrew and Japanese, unprecedented goal for a small independent type foundry.

Notable able fonts are listed below: * FF Eureka for FontFont, 1995 * FF Eureka Sans for FontFont, 1998 * Fedra Sans for Typotheque, 2001 * Fedra Mono for Typotheque, 2002 * Fedra Serif for Typotheque, 2003 * Fedra Arabic for Typotheque, 2007 * Greta Text for Typotheque, 2007 * Greta Display for Typotheque, 2007 * Greta Display for Typotheque, 2007 * History for Typotheque, 2008 * Irma Text for Typotheque, 2011 * Julien for Typotheque, 2011 * Karloff for Typotheque, 2012 * Lava for Typotheque, 2013  Magazines  Between 2000 and 2007, Biƒæak was the co-founder (along with Stuart Bailey), co-editor, and designer of Dot Dot Dot, an art and design journal. Dot Dot Dot is a biannual, self- published, after-hours magazine, originally centred around graphic design, later broadening in scope to interdisciplinary journalism on subjects that affect the way people look at the world, think about and make design. It was not to be a magazine showing visual outcomes of the design process, but presenting the recurring themes of daily work. It was designed to change the way of thinking from 'what a design magazine should show' to 'what we are interested in as designers'. After three issues, the tagline 'graphic design/visual communication magazine', was scrapped, since Biƒæak thought there was no reason why some things like film, music, literature should not be in the magazine. The only connection it has with graphic design is that the co-founders studied design. The last issue of Dot Dot Dot magazine was published in summer 2010. In 2013, after raising ‚Ç¨30,000 in a crowdfunding campaign,[10] Works That Work press release Biƒæak founded Works That Work, a magazine of unexpected creativity, published twice a year by Typotheque, in print and digital edition. Works That Work is an international design magazine that looks studies the impact of design around the world, comparable as the National Geographic of design. The British national daily newspaper The Guardian named Works That Work as 'some of the best-looking new magazines',[11] The beautiful magazines setting out to prove print isn't dead and Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University reported how 'the small magazine has found a way to get noticed globally by creating a beautiful digital edition as well as a creative way to distribute its print copies‚Äîgaining a lot of ever-coveted user engagement in the process.' .[12] In the Netherlands, a magazine experiments with \\"social distribution\\" (and they don't mean retweets) Works That Work distributes 43% of its print run [13] First year of Works That Work magazine in numbers. via their Social Distribution, a reader-based system of distribution of physical copies of magazine bypassing traditional distribution channels.[14] Reader based distribution of magazine  Other projects  In 2003, he designed a series of the standard post stamps for the Dutch Royal mail (TNT Post), today one of the Icons of the Post.[15] Iconen van de post The design of these standard postage stamps was inspired by the Dutch landscape, the starting point being the view of geometric fields from the air, the first view of the country offered to any visitor landing at Amsterdam airport. Besides the inspiration coming from the landscape, the stamps offer another reading. The design is purely typographical, as the width of each letter determines the width of the surrounding block. This depicts how old- style metal printing works, setting metal punches next to each other. In this respect the stamps can be seen as a modest homage to the traditions of Dutch typography. The stamps have been reprinted three times, totalling over 143,000,000 copies. The 2010 edition was slightly modified. From 2004 he has been collaborating with the choreographer Luk√°≈° Timulak on the concepts of dance performances. Together they were subject of an exhibition 'InLoop/EnTry' in Stroom, Centre for Art and Architecture.[16] Stroom,Centre for Art and Architecture Biƒæak defines the concept of the dance pieces, getting involved very early on in the process. While it is clear what Timulak does as the choreographer, Biƒæak's role has been defined in the theatre credits sometimes as designer, stage designer, sometimes as dramaturge, sometimes described simply by the noun 'concept'.

Vietnamese court music is very diverse, but the term nh√£ nh·∫°c refers specifically to the Vietnamese court music performed from the Tr·∫ßn dynasty of the 13th century to the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty at the end of the 20th century. Nh√£ Nh·∫°c Vietnamese court music was performed at annual ceremonies, including anniversaries and religious holidays, as well as special events such as coronations, funerals or official receptions, by highly trained and skilled court musicians. Along with the musicians, a number of intricate court dances also exist (see Traditional Vietnamese dance). Both musicians and dancers wore elaborately designed costumes during their performances. While the largest foreign influence on nh√£ nh·∫°c came from the Ming dynasty court of China, later on there were also adapted a few elements from the music of Champa, which the Vietnamese court found intriguing. Instruments Instruments commonly used for nh√£ nh·∫°c include k√®n b·∫ßu (conical oboe), ƒë√†n t·ª≥ b√† (pear-shaped lute with four strings), ƒë√†n nguy·ªát (moon-shaped two-string lute), ƒë√†n tam (fretless lute with snakeskin-covered body and three strings), ƒë√†n nh·ªã (two-stringed vertical fiddle), s√°o (also called s√°o tr√∫c; a bamboo transverse flute), tr·ªëng (drum played with sticks), and other percussion instruments. Development during the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty It is believed that nh√£ nh·∫°c did not truly reach the pinnacle of its development until the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty, when it was standardized. The Nguy·ªÖn emperors declared it as the official court music, and it became an essential part of the extensive rituals of the royal palace. UNESCO Nh√£ nh·∫°c is still performed in the old capital of Hu·∫ø. 'Nh√£ nh·∫°c of Hu·∫ø court' () was recognised in 2003 by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

Washington Court House City Schools The Washington Court House City School District enrolls most school-age children within the city limits of Washington Court House. Presently, operating school buildings include: *Cherry Hill Elementary (Grades K-2) *Belle Aire Intermediate (Grades 3-5) *Washington Middle School (Grades 6-8) *Washington High School (Grades 9-12) The district also operates a combination administrative office and school bus garage. Sunnyside Kindergarten Sunnyside Kindergarten was used as the Kindergarten building for 11 years. The hallways are covered in murals. This school building was sold to Heritage Memorial Church in \\"Capture the Dream\\" school facility reconstruction project. The school is now a free clothing center for low income families called \\"The Well.\\" Washington Elementary Schools The four elementary schools (Belle Aire, Cherry Hill, Eastside, and Rose Avenue) were demolished (With the exception of the newer portion of Belle Aire) in accordance with the school reconstruction project. New Cherry Hill and Belle Aire facilities house K-2 and 3-5, respectively. Washington Middle School The current middle school houses grades 6-8 and is located on Elm Street, conjoined to the high school by a building called Liberty Hall. Drama and Choral Music The Middle School Choir was directed by Jane Morse, who recently retired. She and Mrs. Wright, who is the study hall director, present a Jr. Broadway musical each year. In the past they have done Annie Get Your Gun, Bugsy Malone, The Music Man, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Oklahoma!, The King and I, Once Upon a Mattress, Aladdin, and most recently, Annie. Choirs include sixth grade, seventh grade, and eighth grade. Mrs. Morse also coached students for the annual solo and ensemble competition. Instrumental Music In fifth grade, students interested in band choose their instruments. The Middle School Band Department is led by Ben Streitenberger. Bands include sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, and jazz. The seventh and eighth grade bands participate in annual solo and ensemble and large group contests. Washington Senior High School The oldest standing high school is the city's old middle school, which is home to the city's auditorium. The second- oldest standing high school was the city's old Sunnyside Kindergarten, which is now The Well, a free-clothing store for low-income houses. In the early 1960s, a new high school was constructed on Willard Street. However, that high school has been recently demolished, as it was built upon a marsh-like ground, and began to sink. In 2009, the newest high school was built, which currently sits on Elm Street along with the new middle school. Both schools are connected by a building called Liberty Hall, which has a very small auditorium that can fit roughly 150 people. Some residents protest that the high school does not participate in the National Honor Society, and that the district's substitute, the \\"Academy of Scholars,\\" does not hold as much weight with colleges as the NHS. Washington Senior High has approximately 50 staff members, and approximately 700 students in grades 9-12. Only the school board is aware of numbers as to teacher/student capacity in the new schools. Drama and Choral Music In the past several years, Washington has performed annual Broadway musicals, such as South Pacific, Big, Footloose, Children of Eden, West Side Story, Beauty and the Beast, Seussical, The Sound of Music, Godspell, Peter Pan, and most recently, The Phantom of the Opera. The school also has the concert choir, the symphonic choir, and the show choir. Instrumental music The director of the high school's bands is master teacher Matt Stanley. He directs the school's jazz band, concert band, symphonic band, marching band, and pep band. On Friday Nights during the Autumn Football Season, the marching band can be heard throughout town. The marching style of the band is modeled after The Ohio University Marching 110, which is not a true \\"marching\\" band but more a \\"performance\\" band. The WCH Marching Band currently has 140 members. The band plays a variety of songs from Classic Rock such as \\"Crazy Train\\" by Ozzy Osbourne, to newer hits like \\"Bad Romance\\" by Lady Gaga. The trademark song of the marching band is \\"Long Train Runnin'\\" by The Doobie Brothers. The pep band supports the school's boys' basketball team. Research History This class in Washington Court House's high school curriculum places seniors within reach of leading national scholarship through the analysis of primary source documents. Master teacher Paul LaRue instructs students for this class. Some projects either completed or in progress are as follows: *Compiling a single record of all who are buried in the Soldier's Home Cemetery, Washington, DC (the companion national cemetery to Arlington) from two separate and conflicting records. *Constructing and maintaining two websites on the Civil War U.S. Colored Troops, or USCT. One website is dedicated to USCT from Ohio and is highly ranked in Google searches. *Obtaining and installing headstones for many unmarked black veterans in the Washington Cemetery, many from the USCT. *Obtaining and installing headstones for unmarked veterans in the Bloomingburg Cemetery, Bloomingburg, OH. (For which the students earned an award from The History Channel, below) *Compiling a publishable historical account of the Bloomingburg Cemetery *Obtaining Historical Site Markers from the Ohio Historical Society for many historically significant areas in and around Washington Court House *Developing pamphlets for distribution about various historical sites around Washington Court House In 2005, the research history team sent two representatives to Washington, DC to compete in a national history research competition sponsored by \\"The History Channel.\\" The program, called \\"Save Our History,\\" included project submissions from hundreds of schools and extracurricular teams from across the country. Washington Court House's Research History class placed in the final four high school teams, and thus, was offered an all-expenses-paid trip for two student representatives to the nation's capital. For the same project work done, the class received plaques from the Veteran's Administration's headquarters in Washington, DC. New School Buildings Some time ago, some residents voted on a levy in order to secure tax monies to replace the aging school buildings currently in use, with a total budget of $60,693,801. The majority of funds, $39,694,272, were provided by state, while the local community is providing $13,946,000. Locally funded initiatives provided an extra $7,053,529. On May 7, 2006, a groundbreaking ceremony took place near the old high school and Eastside Elementary. Washington City Schools began a two-year construction project which replaced the existing facilities with four new school buildings. The project took roughly three years to complete, and was met with mixed reviews from the community. Miami Trace Local School District The Miami Trace Local School District serves parts of the city in question, while providing education for almost every area in Fayette County which surrounds the city. The vast amount of land area covered by this school district, while less population-dense of an area, warrants a larger student body than the \\"city\\" school district. As a tradition, Miami Trace and Washington city schools are athletic rivals. In 2009, a new elementary school for Miami Trace was completed, which lies adjacent to the high school along S.R. 41-NW. Currently under construction is a state-of-the-art middle school, which is slated for open for spring of the 2010-2011 academic year. With the completion of the new middle school, Miami Trace Local School District will be known as a centralized education district. Fayette Christian School A small number of students attend Fayette Christian School, placing it as the only alternative to public education in Fayette county. Southern State Community College The Fayette County campus of Southern State Community College (SSCC) is the only college in this town. It is primarily used by students at the local high schools for college classes and credit, or for getting primary classes finished. Southern State Community College allows students to transfer their credits to some other colleges.

Plot Cute and bubbly Sally Malasmas (Toni Gonzaga) reluctantly agrees to process her application for a visa, obeying her parents‚Äô wish that their small family be reunited. The rest of her family: mom, dad and older sister, Charry (Jodi Sta. Maria) are already residing states-side and they worry that she is lonely living in the Philippines by herself; but as far as Sally is concerned, her simple Philippine life surrounded by loyal, loving friends and co-workers is nearly perfect. However, during the interview process for her Visa application, things goes awry and her application gets abruptly denied by the handsome, yet dismissive American consul, Will Derby (Sam Milby). The next day, a bewildered Will wakes from a one-night stand with a girl he picked up from a bar the night before and due to the notorious Manila gridlock, he misses work. He finds himself instead diverted to the Census Bureau where Sally incidentally works. Seeing an opportunity for revenge, Sally buries Will's inquiry form beneath an already mounting pile of paperwork. As she expected, Will waits all day for his turn through sweltering heat and hunger until he gets fed up and finally confronts the scheming Sally. She gives him a dose of his own medicine and nonchalantly brushes him off, informing him that his form cannot be processed properly because it is incomplete and that he must return the next day since its time for her to go home. An outraged Will cries foul to Sally's supervisor, who sides with him. Thus, in order to redeem the bureau's reputation, Sally is ordered to stay behind after hours until Will finds the information he needs. As it turns out, Will's cold and sullen demeanor is due to him agonizing over the search for his birth parents and any remaining family members he may still have in the Philippines; but more importantly, the reason why he was given up for adoption, a question that has been gnawing at him for years. Sympathizing with Will's plight, Sally takes it upon herself to help him find what he's looking for and through this common purpose the pair bonds and grows closer. But it seems that each has a different idea of exactly what their new-found friendship means to the other. Will's casual relationships with women conflicts with Sally's more traditional, old-fashioned virtues. Together, they must set aside differences, overcome clashing cultural prejudices and ethnocentric beliefs; otherwise, unsettled issues may put a stopper to their blossoming romance before they get the chance to realize its full potential.

He had two daughters but no sons and the title became extinct on his death in 1913. Robert Loyd-Lindsay, 1st Baron Wantage, was the younger brother of the second Baronet. The Lindsay Baronetcy, of Dowhill in the County of Kinross, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 27 February 1962 for the soldier, explorer and Conservative politician Martin Lindsay. He was a descendant of Sir William Lindsay of Rossie, 1st of Dowhill (b. 1350), uncle of David Lindsay, 1st Earl of Crawford. His great-grandfather Colonel Martin Lindsay commanded the 7th Regiment (The Seaforths) during the Napoleonic Wars and led the bayonet charge which broke through the French defences at the Battle of Merxem. The presumed third Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.

He is the founder and former chairman of Inditex fashion group, best known for its chain of Zara clothing and accessories shops. As of December 2019, Ortega had a net worth of $68.3 billion, making him the second- wealthiest person in Europe after Bernard Arnault, and the sixth-wealthiest in the world. For a brief period of time in 2015, he was the richest man in the world, bypassing Bill Gates when his net worth peaked to $80 billion as Zara's parent company, Inditex's, stock peaked. He is the head of the Ortega family and the second wealthiest retailer in the world. Early life and education The youngest of four children, Ortega was born in Busdongo de Arb√°s, Le√≥n, Spain, to Antonio Ortega Rodr√≠guez and Josefa Gaona Hern√°ndez from the province of Valladolid, and spent his childhood in Le√≥n. He left school and moved to A Coru√±a at the age of 14, due to the job of his father, a railway worker. Shortly after, he found a job as a shop hand for a local shirtmaker called Gala, which still sits on the same corner in downtown A Coru√±a, and learned to make clothes by hand. Career In 1972, he founded Confecciones Goa to sell quilted bathrobes. In 1975, he opened his first Zara store with his wife Rosal√≠a Mera. In 2009, Zara was part of the Inditex group (Industrias de Dise√±o Textil Sociedad An√≥nima), of which Ortega owned 59.29%, and aside from over 6,000 stores included the brands Zara, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Zara Home, Kiddy's Class, Tempe, Stradivarius, Pull and Bear, Bershka and has more than 92,000 employees. His public appearance in 2000, as part of the warm-up prior to his company's initial public offering on the stock market in 2001, made headlines in the Spanish financial press. However, he has only ever granted interviews to three journalists. In 2011, Ortega announced his imminent retirement from Inditex, parent company of the Zara chain, stating that he would ask Inditex vice-president and CEO Pablo Isla to take his place as head. In 2012 Ortega donated about ‚Ç¨20 million to Caritas Internationalis, a Roman Catholic relief organisation. He purchased the Torre Picasso skyscraper in Madrid. He also purchased the Epic Residences and Hotel in Miami, Florida. As of 2016, he owned around 60% of Inditex, which is the holding company for Zara and related chains. In July 2017, for its second edition of the AEF awards, the Spanish Association of Foundations awarded Amancio Ortega in the 2017 Philanthropic Initiative category. He also donated 300 million euros to fight cancer across Spain, which were invested in the purchase of 440 machines to detect the disease. As a result of this, the number of Spanish public hospitals equipped with stereotactic radiotherapy machines has risen from 20 to 70. However, these decisions were not unanimously welcomed and were criticized by some political parties like Podemos. Recently, news indicate that he has bought the Troy Block complex, known to the public as one of the buildings where Amazon Seattle has its headquarters. Personal life Ortega is very private about his personal life, as of 2012 he has only given three interviews to journalists. He married Rosalia Mera in 1966, the couple divorced in 1986. Mera died in August 2013 at the age of 69. He married his second wife Flora in 2001. He has three children. As of 2017, despite owning a huge real estate portfolio he mostly lives with his wife in his apartment in A Coru√±a, Spain.\\"Meet the reclusive Spanish billionaire who just beat out Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world\\" , Business Insider, Kate Taylor and Will Martin, August 30, 2017 Ortega being very reclusive keeps a very low profile. He is mostly spotted being driven around in a black Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221) and a black Mercedes-Benz GL-Class (X166). He owns two yachts \\"Drizzle\\" and \\"Valoria B\\" as well as Gulfstream G650 and Bombardier Global Express private jets. Until 1999, no photograph of Ortega had ever been published. He likes to dress simply, refuses to wear a tie, and typically prefers to wear a simple uniform of a blue blazer, white shirt, and gray trousers, none of which are Zara products.

Some of Schmitt's and his colleagues' most promising work was done with collagen, fibrinogen, striated, and smooth muscle, along with the fibrous proteins of neurons (Schmitt, 150). In 1952, Schmitt was working with two British students in order to teach them about electron microscopy. Using this new technology, these two students proposed the Sliding Filament Theory of muscle contraction. Ground breaking research was constantly coming out of his lab. In 1941, Schmitt was recruited by MIT's Karl Compton and Vannevar Bush to lead radically new Department of Biology there that would combine biology, physics, mathematics, and chemistry. Schmitt became an authority on electron microscopy and conducted innovative studies on kidney function, tissue metabolism, and the chemistry, physiology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology of the nerve. He became Institute Professor in 1955 and professor emeritus in 1973. In 1962, Schmitt helped to found the Neurosciences Research Program and served as its chairman from 1962 to 1974. Schmitt was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a former president of the Electron Microscope Society of America. He was awarded the Albert Lasker Award in 1956, the Alsop Award in 1947, and the T. Duckett Jones Award in 1963.

Biography Arnaiz-Villena was president of Spain's National Society of Immunology from 1991 to 1995. He has written more than 300 papers in immunology and human and bird population genetics. He used to be head of the Department of Microbiology I (Immunology) at the Complutense University of Madrid and now is chairman and full professor at the same department. In 2009, he worked at Hospital 12 de Octubre., pages 15 and 18. In 2010 he was invited to give a lecture in The French Academy of Sciences (College de France). In 2011 he gave a lecture at The Royal Society (London).http://royalsociety.org/events/2011/plagues-pathogens- selection/http://downloads.royalsociety.org/audio/KAV/SM/2011_02/arnaiz- villena.mp3 In 2014 he and four other people were given an award on the 35th anniversary of the Law on Transplantations at the Spanish Senate by Queen Sof√≠a of Spain. Ethnicity research=Jews and Palestinians Arnaiz- Villena's research was internationally reported following the publication of a paper on the genetic history of Jews and Palestinians, which he co-authored in the journal Human Immunology in 2001. This became controversial because of its assertions about the origins of the Palestine-Israeli conflict. Following strong criticism, it was withdrawn from the journal and deleted from the scientific archive. Also, academics who had already received a copy of the journal were urged to \\"physically remove\\" the article pages in a move that had no precedent in research publishing. The comments about Arab-Israeli conflicts were described as \\"extreme political writing\\", which included claims that Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon lived in \\"concentration camps\\". Arnaiz- Villena was removed from the journal's editorial board. The decision was met with opposition from several academics. Andrew Goffey, a senior lecturer at Middlesex University, England, observing that \\"it was conceded that the article had not been removed on the basis of its scientific evidence,\\" failed to find anything offensive in the paper. Several scientists wrote to the publishers to support Arnaiz-Villena and to protest their heavy-handedness. One of them said: \\"If Arnaiz-Villena had found evidence that Jewish people were genetically very special, instead of ordinary, you can be sure no one would have objected to the phrases he used in his article. This is a very sad business.\\"Andrew Goffey, Mercenary molecules: immunology and the holy war . Mediactive, 1 July 2003. Greeks and Sub-Saharans Arnaiz-Villena et al. published five scientific articles, where, among other claims, they concluded that the Greek population originates from Sub-Saharan Africa and do not cluster with other Mediterraneans. The explanation they offered is that a large number of Sub-Saharans had migrated to Greece (but not to Crete) during Minoan times, i.e. predating both Classical and Mycenaean Greece. Those conclusions were related to the \\"Black Athena\\" debate and became embroiled in disputes between Greek and ethnic Macedonian nationalists. They cited D√∂rk et al. for having found a marker on Chromosome 7 that is common to Black Africans and, among Caucasoid populations, is found only in Greeks. D√∂rk et al. did find an African-type of cystic fibrosis mutation in Greeks, however this mutation was extremely rare; it was detected only in three Greek families. The explanation they offered is quite different from Arnaiz-Villena's. D√∂rk et al. state: \\"Historical contacts‚Äîfor example, under Alexander the Great or during the ancient Minoan civilization‚Äîmay provide an explanation for the common ancestry of disease mutations in these ethnically diverse populations.\\" Hajjej et al. claimed to have confirmed the genetic relatedness between Greeks and Sub-Saharans. However they used the same methodology (same gene markers) and same data samples like Arnaiz-Villena et al. Other authors contradict Arnaiz- Villena's results. In The History and Geography of Human Genes (Princeton, 1994), Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza grouped Greeks with other European and Mediterranean populations based on 120 loci (view MDS plot). Then, Ayub et al. 2003 did the same thing using 182 loci (view dendrogram). Another study was conducted in 2004 at Skopje's University of Ss. Kiril and Metodij, using high-resolution typing of HLA-DRB1 according to Arnaiz-Villena's methodology. Contrary to Arnaiz-Villena's conclusion, no sub-Saharan admixture was detected in the Greek sample. In a sample of 125 Greeks from Thessaloniki and Sarakatsani, 2 Asian-specific mtDNA sequences (M and D) were detected (1.6%). No sub-Saharan African genes were observed in this population, therefore, non- Caucasoid maternal ancestry in Greece is very low, as elsewhere in Europe. Additionally, in a sample of 366 Greeks from thirteen locations in continental Greece, Crete, Lesvos and Chios, a single African haplogroup A Y Chromosome was found (0.3%). This marks the only instance to date of sub-Saharan DNA being discovered in Greece. In another sample of 42 Greeks, one sequence of the Siberian Tat-C haplogroup turned up, while other studies with larger sample populations have failed to detect this paternal marker in the Greek gene pool and while its frequencies are actually much higher in Scandinavian and Slavic populations. Also, a paper has detected clades of haplogroups J and E3b that were likely not part of pre-historic migrations into Europe, but rather spread by later historical movements. Greeks possess none of the lineages denoting North African ancestry within the last 5000 years and have only 2% (3/148) of the marker J-M267, which may reflect more recent Middle Eastern admixture. Jobling et al., in their genetics textbook \\"Human Evolutionary Genetics: Origins, Peoples & Disease\\", state that Arnaiz- Villena's conclusions on the Sub-Saharan origin of Greeks, is an example of arbitrary interpretation and that the methodology used is not appropriate for this kind of research. Karatzios C. et al., made a systematic review of genetics and historical documents, showing great flaws in Arnaiz-Villena's methodology and theory on the Greeks/Sub-Saharan genetic relationship. Three respected geneticists, Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Alberto Piazza and Neil Risch, criticised Arnaiz-Villena's methodology. They stated that \\"Using results from the analysis of a single marker, particularly one likely to have undergone selection, for the purpose of reconstructing genealogies is unreliable and unacceptable practice in population genetics. The limitations are made evident by the authors‚Äô extraordinary observations that Greeks are very similar to Ethiopians and east Africans but very distant from other south Europeans; and that the Japanese are nearly identical to west and south Africans. It is surprising that the authors were not puzzled by these anomalous results, which contradict history, geography, anthropology and all prior population-genetic studies of these groups.\\" Arnaiz-Villena et al. countered this criticism in a response, stating \\"single-locus studies, whether using HLA or other markers, are common in this field and are regularly published in the specialist literature\\". Meso-Americans Arnaiz-Villena also co-authored a paper on the origins of Mesoamerican populations, which made claims concerning multi- ethnic origins of pre-Columbian populations in the area. The paper argued that the peopling of the Americas \\"was probably more complex than postulated by Greenberg and others (three peopling waves)\\", but noted that \\"Meso and South American Amerindians tend to remain isolated in the Neighbor-Joining, correspondence and plane genetic distance analyses.\\" Ethnic Macedonians Arnaiz-Villena et al. published two scientific articles, where, among other claims, they concluded that ethnic Macedonians are closely related to Mediterraneans, showing the closest genetic relatedness with Cretan Greeks but not with other Greeks. Fringe linguistic theories Arnaiz-Villena and Jorge Alonso-Garcia claim to have used Basque to decipher many of the ancient languages of the Mediterranean and Middle East which are known to be unrelated to Basque,Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 Saltarelli, M. Basque (1988) Croom Helm including Egyptian, Hittite, Sumerian, Hurrian, Ugaritic, Akkadian/Babylonian, Elamite, and Phoenician, all of which they claim have been misidentified and mistranslated by the world's linguists and epigraphers for a century. They characterize mainstream research as \\"science fiction stories\\".See for instance the chapter \\"Cuentos de ciencia ficci√≥n\\" in Alonso and Arnaiz Egipcios, bereberes, guanches y vascos (Madrid, 2000), where they claim that Egyptology \\"remains anchored in a stark esoterism feeding all sorts of science fiction stories\\" (sigue anclados en un esoterismo descarnado alimentando toda clase de cuentos de ciencia ficci√≥n, p. 443); they make the same claim for Assyriology and Hittitology in \\"Cauc√°sicos, turcos, mesopot√°micos y vascos\\" (Madrid 2001, p. 355). Arnaiz-Villena's Egyptian translations, for example, include the cartouche of the bilingual Rosseta Stone in which Champollion identified the name of Ptolemy; in Arnaiz-Villena's interpretation it does not include that name, so that it is actually Arnaiz- Villena who deserves credit for deciphering the hieroglyphs.In the accepted translation, the cartouche in question reads \\"King Ptolemy, living forever, beloved of Ptah\\" which, according to Arnaiz-Villena, should instead be translated as \\"cremation-one-if-death-prayer-fire-brotherhood-deceased- sinners-if\\" in Basque. Arnaiz Villena, Antonio (2007): Lectura de la lengua ib√©rica Similarly, in Arnaiz-Villena's interpretation the Code of Hammurabi contains \\"no hint of laws\\" but is a Basque funerary text,\\"there is no trace of laws in the so-called code. The theme is again funereal and religious. Hammurabi is transcribed in Basque AMA-UR-API ('grave in the waters of the mother')\\" [no hay asomo de leyes en el llamado c√≥digo. La tem√°tica es tambi√©n funeraria y religiosa. Hammurabi se transcribe en vasco AMA-UR-API (\\"tumba en las aguas de la madre\\")]‚ÄîCauc√°sicos, turcos, mesopot√°micos y vascos, p. 178 and section 4d \\"El titulado c√≥digo de Hammurabi (AMA-UR-ABI) y otras 'leyes'\\", pp. 253‚Äì265 and his purported Basque material proper includes the Iru√±a-Veleia graffiti, which had been identified as modern forgeries by a multidisciplinary teamActa de la reuni√≥n de la comisi√≥n cient√≠fico-asesora de Iru√±a/Veleia , despite some isolated attempts to vindicate the Basque words of the inscriptions made by other persons. half a year before his decipherment was published.Antonio Arnaiz Villena: Los graffiti en euskera de Iru√±a Oka y la cultura usko-mediterranea. They also claim to be able to read poorly attested languages such as Etruscan, Iberian, Tartessian, Guanche, and Minoan, which no one else has been able to decipher with any certainty. They posit that these are all part of a \\"Usko-Mediterranean\\" branch of the speculative Den√©‚ÄìCaucasian language family, which they extend to include the Berber languages of North Africa. Prehistoric Iberia, Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al., 2000 Cauc√°sicos, turcos, mesopot√°micos y vascos, Antonio Arn√°iz Villena et al., 2001 Egipcios, bereberes, guanches y vascos, Antonio Arn√°iz Villena et al., 2003 This thesis flatly contradicts basic Egyptological, Sumerian, Semitic, Indo-European, and Mesoamerican scholarship. Phoenician, Akkadian/Babylonian, Ugaritic, and Eblaite, for example, are transparently Semitic languages, and Arnaiz-Villena excludes the rest of the Semitic languages from his family; Egyptian and Berber along with Semitic have been demonstrated to be Afro-Asiatic, and generations of linguists have been unable to find a connection between Berber and Basque or Afro-Asiatic and Basque; and Hittite is widely acclaimed as a key in the reconstruction of Proto-Indo- European, which Arnaiz-Villena acknowledges is completely unrelated to Basque. De Hoz says their work \\"lacks the slightest value and is contrary not just to the scientific method but to common sense\\", and \\"is an unmitigated disaster which in principle should not be reviewed\\", but that he does so because it was published using public funds by the respected Editorial Complutense, which might give it undeserved credibility. He calls this a \\"crime\\" against legitimate research which has gone unpublished for lack of funds. Pichler likewise describes the \\"decipherment\\" of the Canary Island inscriptions as \\"comic\\", pointing out that Arnaiz-Villena \\"translated\\" an inscription of the alphabet as if it formed words (starting with \\"fire deceased earth prayer\\" in Basque), and also found it amazing that the university would publish his books. The \\"Basque\\" words he translated into are themselves dubious, including some that are modern neologisms and some that are loanwords from Romance languages, such as bake (from Latin pace \\"peace\\"Michelena, L. Fon√©tica Hist√≥rica Vasca Publicaciones del Seminario Julio de Urquijo (1961)), and which therefore can say nothing about ancient Basque connections. Lakarra, taking as a sample the list of 32 items entitled \\"Lenguaje religioso-funerario de los pueblos mediterr√°neos\\", provided by Arnaiz-Villena and Alonso as evidence for their decipherment, calculates that of the alleged Basque roots proposed by Arnaiz-Villena and Alonso, 85% are faulty or spurious, sometimes \\"verging on the clumsiest falsification\\", while even the remaining 15% is unclear.Joseba Lakarra Andrinua (2001) \\"El vascuence en Europa\\", in V.M. Amado y De Pablo, S. (eds) Los vascos y Europa, Gasteiz, 75‚Äì121; (2006) \\"Protovasco, munda y otros: reconstrucci√≥n interna y tipolog√≠a hol√≠stica diacr√≥nica\\", Oihenart 21 2006, 229‚Äì322. De ello se deduce que el 85% de las formas vascas (supuestos cognados) son inservibles a efectos comparativos cuando no rozan la falsificaci√≥n m√°s burda; y no se piense que al menos las comparaciones basadas en el 15% restante son oro de aut√©ntica ley ... habr√≠a seguramente mucho que decir ... sobre la antig√ºedad y or√≠genes de varios de ellos \\"It follows 85% of the Basque forms (supposed cognates) are useless for comparison purposes when they don't indicate a coarser falsification; and it shouldn't be thought that at least the comparisons of the remaining 15% are genuine gold ... would certainly have much to say ... about the age and origins of several of them\\", page 245, footnote 29 Suspension and litigation In 2002, Arnaiz-Villena was suspended without pay from the Hospital 12 de Octubre after being charged with embezzlement of funds thought to exceed EUR 300,000.in excess of 50 million pesetas (El Pa√≠s) An audit of the section that Arnaiz directed found accounting irregularities of at least EUR 861,000.ABC 6 March 2002 Un jefe del 12 de Octubre, entre los seis detenidos por malversar fondos. The audit reached the amount of 860,000 for the first of the five years. The police estimated that the amount for the full five years could be EUR 3.91 million (El Pais 3 March 2002 Detenido el jefe de inmunolog√≠a del hospital Doce de Octubre. Fuentes policiales cifran en 3,91 millones de euros el desfase en las cuentas del departamento) Arnaiz-Villena was also accused of the \\"purchase of products not used in his department's health care activities; purchase of hospital products used in health care activities but in quantities much greater than needed; falsification of statistical data apparently to justify purchases; humiliating treatment of department staff; delay in health care activities; and transfer of department products to the university.\\" In March 2003, judges canceled his suspension, ruling it violated the presumption of innocence, and permitting him to return to his post. However, in November 2003 the Court of Administrative Litigation No. 8 of Madrid confirmed the non- criminal charges and sentenced him to 33 months of suspension from work without pay. It did not consider the charge of embezzlement, which was still pending. Arnaiz-Villena denied all charges against him, saying he was the victim of a \\"public lynching\\". Both the hospital and the university stated that the charges had nothing to do with the Human Immunology affair. Arnaiz- Villena said he was prepared to \\"go to Strasbourg\\" to prove his innocence. Though suspended from the hospital, he continued his work at the university. Subsequently, Arnaiz-Villena was absolved and received a favorable decision from a three-body Judge commission of the Madrid Supreme Court and he continues to serve in the same positions he held before the onset of the false accusations against him.

Provincial \\"dot-line\\" lunula from Kerivoa in Brittany The Gold lunula (plural: lunulae) is a distinctive type of late Neolithic, Chalcolithic or (most often) early Bronze Age necklace or collar shaped like a crescent moon.The British Museum describe the (Irish) Blessington lunula (illustrated) as \\"Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, 2400BC-2000BC (circa)\\", webpage They are normally flat and thin, with roundish spatulate terminals that are often twisted to 45 to 90 degrees from the plane of the body. Gold lunulae fall into three distinct groups, termed Classical, Unaccomplished and Provincial by archaeologists. Most have been found in Ireland, but there are moderate numbers in other parts of Europe as well, from Great Britain to areas of the continent fairly near the Atlantic coasts. Although no lunula has been directly dated, from associations with other artefacts it is thought they were being made sometime in the period between 2200‚Äì2000 BC;Needham 1996, 124 a wooden box associated with one Irish find has recently given a radiocarbon dating range of 2460‚Äì2040 BC.Cahill, 277, dates \\"CalBC (at 95% probability)\\"; 276‚Äì278 discuss the dating of Irish lunulae, without reaching very firm conclusions. Of the more than a hundred gold lunulae known from Western Europe, more than eighty are from Ireland;Wallace, 49 it is possible they were all the work of a handful of expert goldsmiths, though the three groups are presumed to have had different creators. Several examples have a heavily crinkled appearance suggesting that they had been rolled up at some point. One Irish example, from Ballinagroun, has had its original Classical engraved decoration beaten over to erase it (not quite successfully), and then a new Unaccomplished scheme added (see below for these classifications).Taylor, 1980, 33; illustrated at Wallace 2:21 This and the fact that it had been folded over several times suggest that it had been in use for a long time before it was deposited.Wallace, 60 The first two examples illustrated show roughly the range of widths of the lowest part of the lunula that is found. Finds in graves are rare, perhaps suggesting they were regarded as clan or group property rather than personal possessions, and though some were found in bogs, perhaps suggesting ritual deposits, more were found on higher ground, often under standing stones.Taylor, 1980, 28 Most gold lunulae have decorative patterns very much resembling beaker pottery from roughly the same period, using geometrical patterns made up of straight lines, with zig- zags and criss-cross patterns, and many different axes of symmetry. The curving edges of the lunula are generally followed by curving border-lines, often with decoration between them. The decoration is typically most dense at the tips and edges, and the broad lower central area is often undecorated between the borders.Wallace, 49‚Äì50; Taylor 1980, 28ff The decoration also resembles that on amber and jet spacer necklaces, which are thought to be slightly later in date. Typology Gold lunulae have been classified into groups as follows:Wallace, 50; Taylor 1980, 27 onwards *Classical, perhaps all made in Ireland, on average the widest, heaviest and also thinnest group. They are thin enough to be flexible when worn, and for the incised decoration to appear as relief on their underside. One aspect of the skill with which they are made is the variation in thickness across the piece, with the inner edge often three times thicker than the middle and the outer edge twice as thick.Taylor, 1980, 35 *Unaccomplished, similar but narrower and less skilfully executed, all Irish *Provincial, only one example found in Ireland. Thicker and more rigid, they were probably all or mostly made outside Ireland. Their decoration can be more varied, and is divided into two groups: \\"dot- line\\", found in Scotland and Wales, and \\"linear\\", found in Cornwall, Belgium and north Germany, as well as the Irish example. The northern coast of France has both types. Punches, not otherwise used in lunulae, are used for the dots in \\"dot-line\\" types.Taylor, 1980, 33 Lunula found in Scotland, 2300-2000 BC It used to be thought that these groups were produced in chronological sequence, but this is now much less certain, although the Ballinagroun lunula does show Unaccomplished decoration replacing Classical when it was reworked. In one large sample of 39 lunulae, the 19 Classical averaged 54 grams, with the 12 Unaccomplished averaging 40 gm.Taylor, 1980, 28 Finds of Classical lunulae are concentrated in the north of Ireland, probably near the sources of gold, with Unaccomplished find spots mostly forming a \\"peripheral border\\" around this area. A few Classical lunulae have been found on the north Cornish coast and in southern Scotland.Taylor, 1980, 33 Three Provincial lunulae were discovered in Kerivoa, Brittany (Kerivoa-en-Bourbriac, C√¥tes-d'Armor) in the remains of a box with some sheet gold and a rod of gold. The rod had its terminals hammered flat in the manner of the lunulae. From this it is thought that Lunulae were made by hammering a rod of gold flat so it became sheet-like and fitted the desired shape. Decoration was then applied by impressing designs with a stylus. The stylus used often leaves tell-tale impressions on the surface of the gold and it is thought that all the lunulae from Kerivoa, and another two from Saint-Potan, Brittany and Harlyn Bay, Cornwall were all made with the same tool. This suggests that all five lunulae were the work of one craftsperson and the contents of the Kerivoa box their tools of trade.Taylor, 1980, 34 Lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold torcs, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular gorgets of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the National Museum of Ireland.Wallace, 88‚Äì89; 3:19‚Äì25 Lusitanian silver lunula, Miranda do Corvo (Portugal) The shape is sometimes found into the Iron Age, now also in silver, though the relation to the much earlier Bronze Age lunulae may be tenuous. A bronze example from the Welsh Llyn Cerrig Bach lake deposit (200 BC ‚Äì 100 AD) has an embossed medallion with a triskele-based design in Celtic La T√®ne style, although it lacks the fastening at the back and has holes that are presumably for fixing it to a surface. It has been suggested it fitted around the pole of a chariot, or was attached to a shield, or worn by a statue.National Museum of Wales, \\"Crescentic-shaped plaque\\" Two silver examples from Ch√£o de Lamas, Coimbra in Portugal of about 200 BC https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1A9TDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA56&lpg;=PA56&dq;=lunula+portugal+celt&source;=bl&ots;=WBP3x1M5nf&sig;=ACfU3U2GIRfs- yDuQWanw8luDOOkkWAetg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj-s6a72rrmAhU- QkEAHWTxAwA4ChDoATAEegQIChAB#v=onepage&q;=lunula%20portugal%20celt&f;=false should perhaps be considered as flattened and widened torcs; similar pieces are worn by figures in sculpture from the same culture.

It derives its name from Mount Royal Park, by which it runs. Between Mount Royal Avenue and Pine Avenue, the street separates the eastern side of the mountain park and the smaller Jeanne Mance Park (formerly known as Fletcher's Field and often referenced as such in Montreal literature). South of Sherbrooke Street, the street's name changes to Bleury Street, and south of Saint Antoine Street in Old Montreal, the name changes again to Saint Pierre Street. The northern end of Park Avenue is at Jean Talon Street, at the location of the former Canadian Pacific Railway Park Avenue station, which now serves the Parc Metro and commuter train station. There is also a short stretch of Park Avenue between Cr√©mazie Boulevard and Chabanel Street.Google Map Once one of Montreal's most elegant residential avenues, Park Avenue is now a busy commercial street, home to the former Rialto Theatre. Since 1924, it has also been an important part of Montreal's Greek community. Park Avenue also lends its name to the Park Extension residential neighbourhood, located at its northern end. History Former Rialto Theatre, July 2011. In 1883, a request by English-speaking citizens was filed with the City of Montreal to name the street Park Avenue (in reference to Mount Royal Park, inaugurated in 1876). It was always officially referred to by its English name, Park Avenue, until September 29, 1961, when its French name, Avenue du Parc, was officially recognized. In 1937, the government planned to change the name of the street to Marconi Street, but it decided to keep its current name following protests by citizens. A similar event occurred on October 18, 2006 when Mayor G√©rald Tremblay proposed to rename Park Avenue (along with Bleury Street) in honour of former Quebec premier Robert Bourassa. On November 28, Montreal City Council voted in favour (40-22) of the motion. If the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec had approved the change, Park Avenue and Bleury Street in their entirety would have been renamed Robert Bourassa Avenue. The proposal was controversial, especially in light of the historical nature of the name. (The STM's Parc Metro and RTM commuter rail station were to remain \\"Parc\\" due to a moratorium on renaming metro stations.) After Bourassa's family publicly expressed reservations about the controversy, Tremblay announced on February 6, 2007 that he would not pursue the issue further and that the council would be presented with a motion to withdraw the resolution made November 28. (A section of University Street was eventually renamed in honour of Bourassa, instead.) In 2005, a C$25 million project began to transform the intersection of Pine Avenue and Park, known as the Pine-Park Interchange. Both Park and Pine Avenues remained open while the interchange was being demolished. It was replaced in the summer of 2006 with a more traditional ground-level intersection, which is easier for pedestrians and cyclists to navigate. The interchange had been the only constructed part of the proposed Autoroute 415. Greektown Greektown is a proposed name for a neighbourhood located on Park Avenue between Mount Royal Avenue and Van Horne Avenue.Montreal Gazette:City to name Park a Greek village Historically, Greek influence has been very strong in this area along with the adjoining Park Extension neighbourhood. There are over 61,000 Montrealers of Greek descent.Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables, 2006 Census Montreal's Greektown was where fans celebrated the victory of Greece in the 2004 UEFA European Football Championship.URBANPHOTO: Cities / People / Place ¬ª Rebranding Park Avenue Public transit Bus routes along Park Avenue include the Montreal Transit Corporation's 80 Avenue du Parc and 480 Express du Parc. There are bus lanes along the length of the road (except for the short stretch passing through the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie). Due to the high volume of bus passengers in the corridor, the city of Montreal has proposed building a tramway along the length of Park Avenue, which is projected to connect the city centre to the Exo's Parc commuter rail station and the Montreal Metro's Parc station. The Autorit√© r√©gionale de transport m√©tropolitain (ARTM) believes the tram has a potential ridership of 11,600 daily passengers.

He treated with the famous condottiero Braccio da Montone when the latter was sent to occupy the city; in 1420, he seized the effective lordship of Bologna but had soon to cede it to the newly elected Pope Martin V, in exchange for the Castel Bolognese.

Exiled from his city despite his position as Papal commander, Bentivoglio was finally able to return in Bologna on 4 December 1435 at the head of a large number of exiles. However, his presence raised the suspicions of the papal legate Daniele da Treviso, who had him taken prisoner and beheaded.

Shark) or Requin (French, lit. Shark) is a one-design, sloop-rigged keelboat designed in Finland. It was designed in 1930 by Finnish sailboat designer Gunnar Stenb√§ck as a cheap racing and cruising yacht suitable for mass production. It remains a popular small yacht in Finland and France. History In the 1920s, one-design yacht classes were relatively scarce and dominating form of yacht racing were various construction classes, which' boats were designed and built one at the time, and thus were quite expensive. Many Nordic top sailors and designers expressed concern about the future of the sport, and Stenb√§ck argued strongly that only in one-design class the costs could be kept suitably low. As a result, Hai design specified inexpensive materials (Northern pine and oak, iron ballast instead of lead) and relatively small sail area so that winches were not required. Keel was long and shallow, to ensure safety on rocky Baltic waters. Finnish Hai boats in a race. Stenb√§ck presented his design in 1930; the first boat was built and presented to the public next year and the design soon proved popular and many yards began constructing the class. The HSS yachtclub in Helsinki was instrumental in giving impetus to the class before World War II. Boats were also exported; around 100 boats to France, some thirty to USA and also to Germany, Sweden and Baltic countries. However, class rules requirement of Finnish made sails slowed down growth abroad and although this was later relaxed, no international class association was ever set up. After World War II, Hai faced stiff competition from Nordic Folkboat and Dragon (which was accepted as Olympic class) and it never achieved same international status. However, it was the biggest keelboat class in Finland until the 1960s, when it was supplanted by Hans Groop's H-boat, also a class initiated by HSS. Despite this, it remains an active competition class and construction of new boats has continued to the day, although in dwindling numbers. In total, around 290 boats have been registered in Finland. The Finnish Hai is somewhat unusual in that it has remained very similar to its original form, with wooden hulls and spars - GRP boats are not allowed. French Requin French Requin. Note the aluminium mast. In France the boat (known as Requin) gained large following and to date, nearly 500 boats have been registered. Owing to lack of authoritative international class association, Requin evolved independently from Finnish class. Plastic is nowadays allowed as hull material, as is aluminium for spars. Sail area is also significantly larger: for mainsail and for jib. Genoa is also allowed in Requin. Hai 2000 A modernized Finnish GRP variant of Hai; hull based on Requin, aluminium spar. Mainsail , jib , spinnaker . Some wooden Hai boats have also been rigged for Hai 2000 class. International competition Though as noted, Hai has never been a major international competition class, some regattas between boats from different countries have been organized, especially in the 1930s when boat was gaining popularity around Baltic, but also in recent years, featuring boats from Finland, Germany and France.

Little known outside of its native country, nonetheless it is capable of producing very high quality wines and is mainly grown in the Tikve≈° region. The introduction of international grape varieties have caused a sharp decline of Stanu≈°ina from the country‚Äôs vineyards in recent times, threatening to wipe out this local variety of grape forever. Realizing this, local wineries have begun initiatives to reintroduce this uniquely old Macedonian domestic variety back into the region. The grapevine is highly resistant to drought and pests and can be cultivated without irrigation. The fruit ripens very late but gives good yields, producing on average 15-20 t/ha. The juice obtained contains approx 18-20% sugar and 6-9 g/l acids. During a good year, it can provide a base for wine of high quality and medium strength, with 11-12% of alcohol. Rich in extract but characteristically pale in color, the high level of acid gives the wine excellent freshness and is recommended to be taken at a temperature of 10-16¬∞C.

This agreement almost completely ended Japanese emigration to America, following the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907. The previous arrangement allowed the wives and family members of Japanese currently living in the United States to emigrate from Japan, but the Ladies' Agreement closed this loophole for prospective immigrants. This loophole had generated rapid flow of Japanese women into the United States until the Ladies' Agreement.Segal, Uma Anand. ‚ÄúThe Emigration of Japanese Woman.‚Äù A Framework for Immigration: Asians in the United States. Columbia University Press, 2002. Background=Japanese immigration Although the immigration of male Japanese workers into the US was essentially cut off by the Gentlemen's Agreement, that of Japanese women remained unrestricted. In the period of heavy immigration of Japanese woman into the Hawaiian islands and west coast of the United States that preceded the Ladies‚Äô Agreement, the Japanese government had encouraged married women to move to America to reunite with their husbands and single women to be assigned husbands in the United States, as they recognized the dangers in a bachelor society. The practice of picture bride matchmaking was often one of the many elaborate ways of escaping restrictions created by the Gentlemen's Agreement.‚ÄúJapanese - U.S. Mainland - Immigration...- Classroom Presentation  Teacher Resources - Library of Congress.‚Äù Apple Computers: This Month in Business History (Business Reference Services, Library of Congress), Victor, www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/alt/japanese3.html. Because the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited Japanese entrance into the U.S., but allowed the immigrant workers already residing there to remain, their desire to start a family as well as Japanese women's desire to explore the opportunities of America were sufficed by the picture bride system.Nakamura, Kelli Y. \\"Picture Brides.\\" Densho Encyclopedia. N.p., 27 May 2017. Web. 1 Mar. 2015. Proxy marriages were another popular way of making it possible for Japanese woman to legally migrate to America, which increased the immigration rate even more.Segal, Uma Anand. ‚ÄúThe Emigration of Japanese Woman.‚Äù A Framework for Immigration: Asians in the United States. Columbia University Press, 2002. This high tide of Japanese women entering America through the west coast helped contribute to a strong American desire to cut it off by closing any loophole that might have allowed it. American response Thus, American politicians and diplomats, one being Charles H. Sherrill, proposed limiting immigration of Japanese women along with men. The agreement was suggested because Americans feared that the practice of picture brides would counteract the effects of the Gentlemen's Agreement. Japanese women and their children often became laborers, thus intensifying the immigrant economic competition that was originally to be avoided. The picture bride system also brought about cultural judgement of Japanese immigrants cultural judgement, as the practice of completely arranged marriage majorly differed from traditional American views on matrimonial choice.‚ÄúLetters From Our Readers.‚Äù Harvey's Weekly, by George B.

Establishing Agreement With the Unites States wanting to eliminate what they believed were cultural and economic problems, and Japan in desire to ease tensions in their relationship with the United States, the two countries negotiated and came to an agreement. On March 1, 1920, the Japanese government would stop giving passports to picture brides.Pennington, Laura. \\"Marriage Migration, Citizenship, and Vulnerability: The International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA).\\" (n.d.): n. pag. Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Web. 2 Mar. 2015. It was negotiated as an informal agreement to avoid the obstacle of ratification and the high stakes of national reputation. This left 24,000 Japanese immigrant bachelors in the United States. The Ladies' Agreement also largely limited the immigration of Korean picture brides, as Korea was occupied by Japan at the time. It was not until 1945, when Korea was liberated from Japan control, that Korean immigration continued to flow into the United States.Thorndike, Jonathan L. ‚ÄúJapanese Immigrants.‚Äù Immigration to the United States, immigrationtounitedstates.org/663-japanese- immigrants.html#sel=45:28,45:69. Effects Although the Ladies' Agreement of 1921 greatly restricted Japanese immigration, complete Japanese exclusion, along with that of the rest of Asian immigrants, was statutorily established by the Immigration Act of 1924.Ngai, Mae M. ‚ÄúThe Architecture of Race in American Immigration Law: A Reexamination of the Immigration Act of 1924.‚Äù The Journal of American History, vol. 86, no. 1, 1999, p. 67.

He was the first Republican since Reconstruction to have been elected to his state's highest court. Background After service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, Hooper received his B.A. degree from Birmingham Southern College and his J.D. degree from the University of Alabama School of Law in Tuscaloosa. With receipt of his Juris Doctor degree, he entered private practice. In 1964, during the Barry Goldwater sweep of Alabama, Hooper was elected probate judge of Montgomery County, the first Republican to have been elected to that position since the 19th century. He continued as the probate judge, handling wills, successions, and estate transactions, until 1974, when was elected Judge of Alabama's 15th Judicial Circuit. In 1983, he returned to private practice. 1968 Senate election In 1968, Hooper was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate for the open seat vacated by retiring Democrat Lister Hill. He won the party nomination in a state convention presided over by subsequent State Representative Bert Nettles, a lawyer then from Mobile. In the general election, Hooper received 201,277 votes (24 percent) to 638,774 (76 percent) for the Democratic nominee, former Lieutenant Governor James B. Allen, a conservative whose views were similar to those of Hooper. Still Hooper polled 54,304 more votes in his statewide race than did his party's presidential nominee, Richard M. Nixon. Hooper narrowly held his home county of Montgomery and fared best among upper-income whites, having received two thirds of the vote in higher socio-economic precincts in both Montgomery and Birmingham. Lower-income whites, conversely, supported Allen by a wide margin. Supreme Court election In 1994, Hooper was narrowly elected Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, with a winning margin of just 262 votes. He was not sworn in until October 20, 1995, almost nine months after his term had begun. It was widely believed that the political allies and trial lawyer friends of Ernest C. \\"Sonny\\" Hornsby, the sitting Democrat Chief Justice whom Hooper defeated, were the forces responsible for finding a plaintiff to sue in court to keep the seat for Hornsby. Hornsby refused to leave office until the disposition of the court case. Hooper and James D. Martin, a perennial Republican figure running that year for state treasurer filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in the case styled Larry ROE, Perry O. Hooper Sr., James D. Martin, and Willie J. Williams, Individually and on Behalf of a Class of Persons, Plaintiffs, v. MOBILE COUNTY APPOINTING, BOARD, et al., 904 F. Supp. 1325, (U.S.D.C.. S.D.

The named plaintiff is Larry Roe, seeking to secure protection for his right to vote, and the rights of other qualified voters. Hooper and Martin also joined the complaint. The defendants were a class of election officials in each county responsible for election management: the probate judge, sheriff, and circuit clerk. They are known as the appointing board for each county in the State. See Ala. Code ¬ß 17-6-1 (1975). The named defendants at that time were the Wilcox County Appointing Board, the Mobile County Appointing Board, and the probate judge in those two counties. Ri-l-2.

It was known as NATO's frontier post for monitoring the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, completely closed on 30 September 1997. This return was the result of the general drawdown of US bases in Europe and improvement in space surveillance technology. The base near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir housed sensitive electronic intelligence- gathering systems for listening on the Middle East, Caucasus and Russia.Globalsecurity.org The Pirin√ßlik sensor system consisted of two radio frequency (RF) mechanical radar systems providing radar intelligence, space surveillance, and missile warning data to multiple users. Observations from Diyarbakƒ±r were normally the first radar reports of new Russian satellite launches from Kapustin Yar in the early days of satellite tracking; see Project Space Track. The site operated both a detection radar (AN/FPS-17) and a mechanical tracking radar (AN/FPS-79). Although limited by their mechanical technology, Pirin√ßlik's two radars gave the advantage of tracking two objects simultaneously in real time. Its location close to the southern Soviet Union made it the only ground sensor capable of tracking actual deorbits of Soviet space hardware. In addition, the Pirin√ßlik radar was the only 24-hour-per-day eastern hemisphere deep-space sensor.William P. Delaney and William W. Ward.

The FPS-17 detection scanning radars have fixed antennae oriented toward the Soviet Union. The Air Force FPS-79 UHF tracking radar at Diyarbakir-Pirin√ßlik in Turkey is capable of tracking missiles during flight. The 10 meter diameter dish antenna system has a variable focus feed horn system which can provide a wide beam for target detection, and a narrow beam for tracking (other similar radars have scan rates in excess of {10^o} per second). Operating at 432 MHz, this radar has a maximum detection range in excess of 4,300 kilometers. AN/FPS-17 fixed antennae radar at the Pirin√ßlik Air Station oriented toward Kapustin Yar, Soviet Union to monitor missile test launches Lincoln Laboratory‚Äôs phase-coded pulse-modulation receiver/exciter for the VHF AN/FPS-17 radar, built at the Pirin√ßlik site in eastern Turkey by the General Electric Company, allowed U.S. observers to monitor missile test launches from Kapustin Yar, deep within the Soviet Union.[2] Subsequent installation of another AN/FPS-17 radar on Shemya, a western island in the chain of Aleutian Islands off Alaska, made it possible for U.S. observers to monitor Soviet missile test flights to the Kamchatka peninsula. The AN/FPS-17 radar was the first demonstration of pulse compression in an operational radar system.Siebert, W.M.

On 1 June 1972, the 7022d Air Base Squadron was activated, under the command of the 39th Tactical Group. On 30 July 1981, the squadron was assigned to The U.S. Logistics Group. Its mission was to support 19th Surveillance Squadron, SAC, at Pirin√ßlik. It received logistical support from ƒ∞ncirlik Air Base. Pirin√ßlik Air Station was a remote site, where personnel lived in quonset hut dorms, had one club for socialization, could not leave base at night, and had few shopping or entertainment opportunities other than an occasional temporary duty to ƒ∞ncirlik. This site was so small that the perimeter fence was practically visible from anywhere on base. The staff consisted of 150 airmen which during the 1980s and after included about 20 or so females, 30+ officers, 120 American civilian contractors, and nearly 300 Turkish military and civilians. On September 30, 1996, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Syracuse, N.Y., was awarded a $16,221,360 face value increase to a fixed price incentive contract to provide for FY 1997 operation, maintenance, and logistic support of the sensor facilities at Pirinclik Air Station. The work was performed at Pirin√ßlik Air Station. The contract was completed September 1997. The 21st Space Wing, Peterson AFB, Colorado, was the contracting activity.

Tu·ªìng or H√°t b·ªôi H√°t tu·ªìng or \\"h√°t b·ªôi\\" was imported from China around the 13th century and was used for entertaining royalty for a time before being adapted for traveling troupes of actors. Stories in the opera tend to be ostensibly historical and frequently focus on the rules of social decorum. Like ch√®o and other forms of opera from around the world, tu·ªìng employs the use of stock characters who are recognizable from their make-up and costumes, which are typically very elaborate and extravagant. C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng (modern folk opera) Compared to tu·ªìng and ch√®o, c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng is more popular in modern Vietnam. Originating in the early 20th century, c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng includes historical and contemporary themes. C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng has remained adaptable for modern innovations and now includes electric guitar and other new inventions. It is accompanied by nh·∫°c t√†i t·ª≠, which is a complex and partially improvised form of chamber music. C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng singing utilizes a great deal of vibrato; the words are extended when singing and the vibrato follows. A common melody used in c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng is V·ªçng c·ªï. Although c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng remained extremely popular as late as the 1970s and the 1980s, nowadays this popularity has dwindled, especially among the younger generation, and the remaining troupes are only able to preserve the art because of government funding.

In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppeteers, who stand in water manipulating the puppets in front of the screen using long poles hidden beneath the water. Due to strict restrictions on learning the art of water puppetry, the form had nearly died out before the Maison des Cultures du Monde intervened in 1984 and helped reinvigorate the genre. Today, water puppetry is popular with tourists to Vietnam.

The tower lies a mile to the north west of Ettrickbridge, and seven miles (11 km) from the Burgh of Selkirk. Construction=Overview A remote and austere building, Kirkhope Tower is of a square footprint and constructed from local stone. It consists of four main floors and a garret floor above the parapet. Its small windows are constructed with simple relieving arches and stand with the exception of the light into the Ground floor at heights of over thirty feet. It stands on rough ground that slopes steeply away to the valley below. Ground floor The ground floor is of vaulted construction and is accessible through a small door that could be easily barricaded by use of an iron yett. The room was lit by an oblique light on the opposite wall to the entrance, affording no view or access to within the chamber from potential attackers. Access to the upper floors was by use of a timber staircase that leads from the left of the entrance to the northeast angle of the building. First floor The first floor of the Tower would have housed the original Hall of the tower with access to the above floors only to be gained by crossing the room to the turnpike in the south east angle. Adjacent to the turnpike is the main entrance to the building, which in times of war could be accessed by a wooden stair or ladder that could be retracted within, the door on the ground being firmly secured. Second and third floors These levels provided accommodation for the Laird and his family with timber floors joisted with oak dividing them. Parapet and garret There are two rectangular turrets in the northwest and southeast angles of the parapet, the latter of which acts of the caphouse for the turnpike staircase rising from below. There are walkways within the parapet to the North, South and East, the western gable being taken up by the flues for the Fireplaces in the floors below. The parapet is supported by simple Corbels. The addition of the covered turrets rather than simple Bartizans suggest a relatively late construction. Exterior There are remains of the Barmkin wall still extant. This originally formed a Bailey around the structure in which cattle and tenants could seek refuge in dangerous times. History Although there is no records of its construction, Kirkhope was presumably constructed by the early part of the 16th century in accordance with an act of the Scottish Parliament, dated 1535 that required large landholders in the Borderlands to build barmkins of stone and lime, sixty square feet in area and with walls of one ell thickness and six ells in height \\"for the resett and defense of him, his tennents, and his gudis in troublous tyme\\". Furthermore \\"with ane toure in the samen for himself gif he thinks it expedient. And that all ather landit men of smaller rent and reuenew [revenue] big [build] pelis and greit strenthis as they please for the saifing of thaimselfs, &c.; and that the said strenthis, barmkynis, and pelis be biggit and completit within twa yeris under pane.\\" Rough Wooing Kirkhope was burnt and its stock removed during the campaign of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk in the early stages of the Rough Wooing of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Henry VIII of England. The actual raiding itself was carried out by members of the cross border \\"Riding Family\\" of Armstrong. Auld Wat Scott of Harden Walter Scott of Harden was a notorious Border Reiver. The tower of Kirkhope was used as a residence of the eldest sons of the Scotts of Harden Castle, immediately to the west of Hawick. Young Wat Scott brought his bride and cousin Mary Scott of Dryhope, better known as the \\"Flower of Yarrow\\" back to Kirkhope prior to the death of his father William. Mary Scott was as renowned for her beauty as much as her mate was known for his belligerence. Wat Scott was later to be a supporter of Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell, an unsuccessful warrant for his arrest was made in 1592 by James VI. Wat Scott, although the subject of many Border ballads is perhaps best remembered by his wife's reaction to empty stores, presenting him with his spurs on a platter for dinner ‚Äì a signal to ready his men for a raid. Later centuries Kirkhope came into the possession of Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, widow of the Duke of Monmouth in the early eighteenth century and from mid-nineteenth century it was allowed to fall into a state of decay. By 1907 the tower was the poetic subject of eleven stanzas by Scottish Border poet and Australian bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963), a romantic reflection of its former life contrasted to its present state: Today Kirkhope Tower was rescued from ruin in the later part of the twentieth century and by 1996 it was again in use as a private residence. It is now owned by Peter Clarke,The Wild Beasts Trust a former Conservative parliamentary candidate and landowner. Clarke was spokesperson for the Wild Beasts Trust, a movement to reintroduce numerous wild species back into the United Kingdom. In 2007 Peter Clarke was interviewed and gave a tour of Kirkhope Tower on the BBC TV programme Castle in the Country, first aired on 16 July 2008, in episode 6 of the 4th series. The tower and associated barmkin has been designated a scheduled monument and Category A listed building by Historic Environment Scotland. As of April 2019, the tower is offered for sale.

They were conceived by Pat McInally, himself a former professional American football player with the Cincinnati Bengals, in 1986. The figures became very popular, and eventually included sports stars from baseball, football, basketball, and hockey; and, to a lesser extent, auto racing, boxing, track & field, skating, soccer, and golf. In the late 2010s, the figures made a comeback as a promotional item at several sporting events. McInally, who graduated cum laude from Harvard University and scored the only verified perfect scored on the NFL's Wonderlic test, came up with the idea during a visit to a toy store. He noticed there were many figurines available of the likes of G.I. Joe, but nothing based on real-life sports heroes. McInally and a former college friend who was running Kenner's day-to-day operations decided to work together on the project. Today, the figures are collector items. The prices on the figures vary dramatically. The low-end items can be acquired for around or above retail cost, but many rarer items can fetch prices as high as several thousand dollars for a single figure. A typical figurine stands about tall, but the brand at times launched various special series that can be much larger including a 14\\" NBA line and came with a sports card of the respective athlete. 1988 Major League Baseball Starting Lineup Kenner debuted the Starting Lineup figures in 1988 by releasing a 124 player set. Each team had at least four players in the set except for the Canadian teams of Montreal and Toronto that had only one player because Kenner believed that there was an insufficient number of retail outlets in Canada to warrant a full team set, (Tim Raines and George Bell, respectively.) The New York Mets had the most players in the set with seven. Kenner tended to distribute the players to stores by geographical region, so it was very difficult to complete the collection or find players from out of market. Different Product Lines While there was always at least one annual set featuring single-packed figures for baseball, basketball, football and hockey, there were many other specialty products such as dual-packed figure sets, team sets, one-on-one scene type sets and much more. In 1989 Kenner introduced the Baseball Greats dual-packed figures, featuring such past Hall of Famers as Mickey Mantle with Joe DiMaggio, and Reggie Jackson with Don Drysdale. Basketball, football and hockey would later get their own dual- packed sets in the late 1990s. 1989 also saw Kenner releasing many other specialty and sometimes one-time only products like the AFC and NFC offensive and defensive helmet sets, 9-figure baseball team sets, baseball, basketball and football one-on-one action sequences featuring two players from different teams, and even a Headliner set which featured a superstar player displayed on a base with a miniature newspaper front page cover touting the accomplishment of that particular player. 1989 was also the year Kenner released the NBA Slam Dunk series, which featured players like Michael Jordan and Larry Bird dunking on a small basketball hoop, complete with backboard and hardwood floor. Kenner would also offer exclusive product lines through their four-issue annual Starting Lineup Collector's Club Newsletter, in which consumers could order such unique items as a Nolan Ryan Freeze Frame product in 1995, featuring the pitcher in four different team uniforms with each figure depicting a different position in his windup and delivery of a pitch. Other specialty product lines included 12\\" doll-like figures in 1997 and the once popular Stadium Stars baseball set featuring larger figurines placed over a base which was a replica of that player's respective stadium; Roger Clemens standing over Fenway Park is one example of such a figure. Boxing figurines were released as part of their \\"Timeless Legends\\" series during the late 1990s, featuring Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Leonard and Muhammad Ali as well as a dual pack with enlarged figures of Ali and Joe Frazier.https://www.amazon.com/s?k=starting+lineup+boxing&i;=toys-and- games&ref;=nb_sb_noss Other important sports figures also had figures of them released as part of that series, including Mary Lou Retton and Pel√©. Comeback Legacy One, Inc. obtained the trademark after Hasbro let it lapse. Match-Up, a Florida company, is licensed to produce Starting Lineup figures as stadium giveaways. In 2016, three professional sports teams gave away special edition Starting Lineup figures. On October 30, 2016 the Tampa Bay Buccaneers released a figure of Jameis Winston. In addition, on November 25, 2016 the San Jose Sharks released a figure of Joe Pavelski and on December 23, 2016 the Charlotte Hornets released a figure of Nicolas Batum.

He was arrested for drug trafficking in 2005 in the United States and jailed. Early life and education Boron was born in Ghana on 19 February 1953. He had his secondary education at Nkoranza Anglican School in Nkoranza, where he passed his O-levels. He then attended Nkoranza Training College in Nkoranza for his A-level education, completing it in 1973. He then attended the Nkoranza Teacher Training College from where he qualified as a teacher. Years later, he attended the University of Ghana, obtaining a diploma in religion in 1992. Career Amoateng initially worked as a teacher. He then worked as marketing manager for the Koajay company, that bought and distributed school supplies. Amoateng was also the chief (king) of Amoma, a town in the Kintampo South District of the Brong Ahafo Region, with the title Nana Amoateng Ameyaw II. He is said to have spent lavishly on his people and earned a reputation for philanthropy. Politics Amoateng unsuccessfully bid to stand as the New Patriotic Party (NPP) candidate for the Nkoranza constituency in 2000 amidst some controversy. Some were reportedly wary of his affluence. It was also reported that, in 2001, Amoateng was accused of visa fraud. Amoateng renounced his chieftaincy in 2004 in order to stand in the December 2004 parliamentary elections on the ticket of the NPP, adopting Bomini in the neighbouring Nkoranza North constituency in the Nkoranza District of the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, as his home town. His candidacy for the Nkoranza North constituency was challenged at the Sunyani High Court in 2004, but the case was eventually withdrawn. He won 46.9 per cent of the votes with a margin of 22.3 per cent to become the first ever Member of Parliament for the newly created Nkoranza North constituency, from 7 January 2005. Elections Amoateng was elected as the member of parliament for the Nkoranza North in the 2004 Ghanaian general elections. He thus represented the constituency in the 4th parliament of the 4th republic of Ghana. He was elected with 9,144 votes out of 18,900 valid votes cast. This was equivalent to 48.40% of total valid votes cast. He was elected over Hayford Francis Amoako of the National Democratic Congress and Kwame Ofosu Adjei Prince an independent candidate. These obtained 5,402 and 4,354 votes respectively. These were equivalent to 28.60% and 23.00% respectively of total valid votes cast. Amoateng was elected on the ticket of the New Patriotic Party. The New Patriotic Party won 14 parliamentary seats out of the total 24 seats for the Brong Ahafo region. In that election of 2004, the party won a majority total of 128 parliamentary seats out of a total 230 parliamentary seats. Arrest, trial and jail Amoateng was arrested in the United States of America on 12 November 2005. He had travelled to the USA on an Emirates Airline flight to the John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) with a friend, Nii Okai Adjei. The trip was ostensibly to buy wrist watches for resale in Ghana with US$9,000 seized from Amoateng. Seven boxes of pottery which had landed at Newark Liberty International Airport from London, destined for JFK a day earlier, were found to contain 136 pounds of heroin. The reported street value of the drugs was about US$6 million. Amoateng and Adjei were monitored by security personnel as they took delivery of the cargo and sent it to a self-storage location on Staten Island. They were arrested the next day when they went to inspect the goods. Amoateng unsuccessfully claimed diplomatic immunity following his arrest. They were charged with \\"conspiracy with intent to distribute heroin\\". Amoateng and Adjei initially pleaded not guilty to the charge of conspiracy to distribute narcotics when brought to court. \\\\- Adjei later changed his plea to guilty. Following this, a second charge was brought against Amoateng. In August 2006, a third charge of \\"distributing a controlled narcotic substance of about a kilogram or more containing heroin\\" was brought against Amoateng. On 19 March, 2007, Amoateng changed his plea to guilty. \\\\- He was sentenced on 12 December 2007 to ten years in jail. He served his sentence at the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center in Pennsylvania, United States. Fallout from arrest=Parliament Following his arrest, there was a long debate as to whether Amoateng should remain MP for Nkoranza North. Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, Majority Chief Whip, maintained that \\"until the case is disposed off he remains a suspect and that the allegation would have to be substantiated\\". While the majority leader in parliament announced that the government would hold the fort for the MP, the opposition insisted that a by- election be held to replace him. This went on for more than ten months. One of his sons, Augustine Akwasi Amoateng, defended his father's innocence in April 2006. Amoateng eventually sent a letter of resignation around May 2006 to parliament but this was rejected on procedural grounds. \\\\- The Speaker of Parliament, Ebenezer Sekyi-Hughes, directed on 30 January 2007, that the question of Amoateng's long absence from parliament be revisited. However, he sent a resignation letter dated 4 February 2007, to the Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana which was accepted. By-elections to replace Amoateng were finally held on 13 March 2007, 16 months after his arrest. The seat was won by Derek Oduro, a retired army major, who was sworn in on 21 March 2007. Investigations within Ghana Investigations instituted within Ghana in order to possibly seize assets obtained through drugs appear to have fizzled out. The Narcotic Controls Board (NACOB) had identified assets of Amoateng's accomplice, Nii Okai Adjei but were unable to pursue the assets of Amoateng possibly due to interference by officials of the NPP government. NACOB indicated its intention to reopen investigations when Amoateng returns to Ghana. He was arrested for questioning by NACOB on his arrival in Ghana on 7 August 2014, at the Kotoka International Airport. He was detained at the Nima Police Station for four days until he could satisfy conditions of bail set by an Accra Circuit Court. Amoateng also faced trial for possessing fake travel documents on his return. His Ghanaian passport with number H2347080 which was issued in February 2009 while he was still in jail, was the same as that issued by the Ghanaian immigration authorities to a woman. He was, however, acquitted because, although the prosecution was convinced the passport was fraudulently acquired, the High Court said the prosecution failed to prove that Amoateng was aware that his passport was forged. In 2017, 12 years after his arrest and three years after his release from jail, NACOB stated they were unable to confiscate his assets as they still do not have the details of his judgement from the United States. Trivia *On 13 February 2006, the Nkoranza constituency branch chairman of the NPP commended the volunteers who worked on Amoateng's 300 hectare maize farm in his absence. *On 24 March 2006, a rally was held in his support by the people of Busunya attended by NPP delegates. Some placards at the rally read \\"Cocaine or No Cocaine Amoateng Is Still Our MP\\". *In April 2007, the chiefs and people of Busunya in the Nkoranza district named a street after Amoateng for his \\"contribution to the socio-economic development of the area\\". He is also reported to have helped to \\"finance the construction of eight streets and drainage systems in the town which is the constituency capital\\".

Eastern Orthodox icon of the Myrrhbearing Women at the Tomb of Christ (Kizhi, Russia, 18th century). Icon of Mary Magdalene as a Myrrhbearer. Hagiography, fresco, of Saint Salome the Myrrhbearer in Greek Orthodox Church. In Orthodox Christian tradition the Myrrhbearers (Greek: ŒúœÖœÅŒøœÜœåœÅŒøŒπ, Latin: Myrophorae; Slavonic: –ñ–µ–Ω—ãÃÅ-–º—∑—Ä–æ–Ω–æÃÅ—Å–∏—Ü—ã; ) are the individuals mentioned in the New Testament who were directly involved in the burial or who discovered the empty tomb following the resurrection of Jesus. The term traditionally refers to the women with myrrh who came to the tomb of Christ early in the morning to find it empty. In Western Christianity, the two women at the tomb, Three Marys or other variants are the terms normally used. Also included are Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who took the body of Jesus down from the cross, embalmed it with myrrh and aloes, wrapped it in clean linen, and placed it in a new tomb. (, , , , ). The women followed Jesus during his earthly ministry in Galilee, providing for him and his followers out of their own means (). They remained faithful to him even during the most dangerous time of his arrest and execution, and not only stood by the cross, but accompanied him to his burial, noticing where the tomb was located. Because of the impending Sabbath, it was necessary for the burial preparations to be brief. Jewish custom at the time dictated that mourners return to the tomb every day for three days. Once the Sabbath had passed, the women returned at the earliest possible moment, bringing myrrh to anoint the body. It was at this point that the Resurrection was revealed to them, and they were commissioned to go and tell the Apostles. They were, in effect, the apostles to the Apostles. For this reason, the myrrhbearing women, especially Mary Magdalene, are sometimes referred to as \\"Equal to the Apostles.\\" Joseph of Arimathea was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly (). He went to Pontius Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus and, together with Nicodemus, hurriedly prepared the body for burial. He donated his own new tomb for the burial. A native of Arimathea, he was apparently a man of wealth, and probably a member of the Sanhedrin (which is the way the biblical Greek, bouleutƒìs‚Äîliterally, \\"counselor\\"‚Äîis often interpreted in and ). Joseph was an \\"honourable counselor, who waited (or \\"was searching\\") for the kingdom of God\\" (). Luke describes him as \\"a good man, and just\\" (). Nicodemus (Greek: ŒùŒπŒ∫œåŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÇ) was a Pharisee and also a member of the Sanhedrin, who is first mentioned early in the Gospel of John, when he visits Jesus to listen to his teachings, but he comes by night out of fear (). He is mentioned again when he states the teaching of the Law of Moses concerning the arrest of Jesus during the Feast of Tabernacles (). He is last mentioned following the Crucifixion, when he and Joseph of Arimathea prepare the body of Jesus for burial (). There is an apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus that purports to be written by him. Names of the Myrrhbearers The Myrrhbearers are traditionally listed as:http://www.goarch.org/special/listen_learn_share/sunday_of_myrrhbearers *Mary Magdalene *Mary, the mother of James and Joses *Mary, the wife of Cleopas *Martha of Bethany, Sister of Lazarus *Mary of Bethany, Sister of Lazarus *Joanna, the wife of Chuza the steward of Herod Antipas *Salome, the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee *Susanna *Joseph of Arimathea *Nicodemus There are also generally accepted to be other Myrrhbearers, whose names are not known. Liturgical references Icon used on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers. The two Marys are in the center with the two angels at either side, in the foreground is the Holy Sepulchre with the winding sheet and napkin. In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches, the Third Sunday of Pascha (i.e. the second Sunday after Easter) is called the 'Sunday of the Myrrhbearers'. The Scripture readings appointed for the services on this day emphasize the role of these individuals in the Death and Resurrection of Jesus: Matins Gospel‚Äî, Divine Liturgy Epistle‚Äî and Gospel‚Äî. Since this day commemorates events surrounding not only the Resurrection, but also the entombment of Christ, some of the hymns from Holy Saturday are repeated. These include the Troparion of the Day: \\"The noble Joseph...\\" (but with a new line added at the end, commemorating the Resurrection), and the Doxastikhon at the Vespers Aposticha: \\"Joseph together with Nicodemus...\\" The week that follows is called the Week of the Myrrhbearers and the Troparion mentioned above is used every day at the Canonical Hours and the Divine Liturgy. The Doxastikhon is repeated again at Vespers on Wednesday and Friday evenings. Many of the Myrrhbearers also have separate feast days on which they are commemorated individually in the Menaion. There are numerous liturgical hymns which speak of the Myrrhbearers, especially in the Sunday Octoechos and in the Pentecostarion. Every Sunday, there is a special hymn that is chanted at Matins and the Midnight Office, called the Hypako√´, (Greek: ŒéœÄŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØ, Slavonic: –é–ø–∞Œ∫–æ–∏), which means, \\"sent\\", and refers to the Myrrhbearing women being sent to announce the Resurrection to the Apostles. There are several prominent Orthodox cathedrals and churches named after the Myrrhbearers. They celebrate their patronal feast day on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers. Role of the Myrrhbearers In the Gospels, especially the synoptics, women play a central role as eyewitness at Jesus' death, entombment, and in the discovery of the empty tomb. All three synoptics repeatedly make women the subject of verbs of seeing,Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), p. 48. clearly presenting them as eyewitnesses.B. Gerhardsson, 'Mark and the Female Witnesses', in H. Behrens, D. Loding, and M. T. Roth, eds., Dumu-E2-Dub-Ba-A (A. W. Sj√∂berg FS; Occasional Papers of the Samuel Noah Kramer Fund 11; Philadelphia: The University Museum, 1989), pp. 219‚Äì20, 222‚Äì23; S. Byrskog, Story as History ‚Äì History as Story (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament Jerusalem Talmud 123; T√ºbingen: Mohr, 2000; remprinted Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 75‚Äì78; Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), p. 48. The presence of women as the key witnesses who discover the empty tomb has been seen as increasing the credibility of the testimony, since, in the contemporary culture (Jewish and Greco-Roman), one might expect a fabrication to place men, and especially numerous and important men, at this critical place, rather than just \\"some grieving women.\\"Ben Witherington III, What have they done with Jesus (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 2006), p. 50. C. H. Dodd considered the narrative in John to be \\"self-authenticating\\", arguing that no one would make up the notion that Jesus had appeared to the \\"little known woman\\" Mary Magdalene.C. H. Dodd, The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953) However, some passages in the Mishnah (Yebamoth 16:7; Ketubot 2:5; Eduyot 3:6) indicate that women could give testimony if there was no male witness available. Also, JosephusJewish War, 7.389 and 4.81 and Pliny the YoungerPliny the Younger, Epistles, X.96. have used women as witnesses to their claims. In addition, Paul does not mention the women. Bart D. Ehrman argues: \\"One of Mark's overarching themes is that virtually no one during the ministry of Jesus could understand who he was. His family didn't understand. His townspeople didn't understand. The leaders of his own people didn't understand. Not even the disciples understood in Mark‚Äîespecially not the disciples! For Mark, only outsiders have an inkling of who Jesus was: the unnamed woman who anointed him, the centurion at the cross. Who understands at the end? Not the family of Jesus! Not the disciples! It's a group of previously unknown women‚Ä¶the women at the tomb‚Ä¶.\\" Bart Erhmann http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p96.htm#EhrmanFirst All three Synoptics name two or three women on each occasion in the passion-resurrection narratives where they are cited as eyewitnesses: the Torah's required two or three witnesses in a statute that had exerted influence beyond legal courts and into situations in everyday life where accurate evidence was needed.B. Gerhardsson, ‚ÄúMark and the Female Witnesses,‚Äù in H. Behrens, D. Loding, and M. T. Roth, eds., Dumu-E2-Dub-Ba-A (A. W. Sj√∂berg FS; Occasional Papers of the Samuel Noah Kramer Fund 11; Philadelphia: The University Museum, 1989), p. 218; Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), p. 49. Among the named women (and some are left anonymous), Mary Magdalene is present in all four Gospel accounts, and Mary the mother of James is present in all three synoptics; however, variations exist in the lists of each Gospel concerning the women present at the death, entombment, and discovery. For example, Mark names three women at the cross and the same three who go to the tomb, but only two are observed to be witnesses at the burial. Based on this, and similar examples in Matthew and Luke, Richard Bauckham argued that the evangelists showed \\"scrupulous care\\" and \\"were careful to name precisely the women who were known to them as witnesses to these crucial events\\" since there would be no other reason, besides interest in historical accuracy, not to simply use the same set of characters from one scene to another.Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (Eerdmans Publishing Company: Cambridge, 2006), pp. 50‚Äì51. Mark's account (which in the earliest extant manuscripts) ends abruptly and claims that the women told no one. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark do not present any further involvement at the tomb. Luke describes Peter as running to the tomb to check for himself, and John adds that the Beloved Disciple did so too, the beloved disciple outrunning Peter.To answer the question of running speed: It is never explained why the disciple(s) move(s) from merely traveling to running, and it has often been speculated that running only occurred on the last stretch once the tomb had come within sight. John Calvin instead speculated that the rush was due to religious zeal. In particular, John describes the Beloved Disciple as outracing Peter, though waiting for Peter to arrive before entering the tomb, with some scholars seeing the out-racing as a metaphoric elevation of the Beloved Disciple above Peter. However, many Christian scholars object to this interpretation, instead arguing that since the Beloved Disciple is usually interpreted as a reference to the author of John, it would be necessary for him to be considerably younger than Peter, and hence his speed could be due simply to youthful vigour. Another question is why John the Beloved Disciple pauses outside the tomb. While many view it as being due to his not wanting to violate death ritual by entering a tomb, in contrast to Peter who has no such qualm and instead enters immediately, most scholars believe John is simply deferring to Peter, particularly since the Beloved Disciple enters the tomb once Peter is inside. There is some scriptural variation as to whom the women told and in what order.What happens once Mary (and Mary) has seen the occupier(s)/empty tomb is again one of the more variant parts of this narrative. According to Mark, even though the man in the tomb instructs Mary and Mary to inform the disciples ‚Äò‚Äòand‚Äô‚Äò Peter, they flee in fear and do ‚Äò‚Äònot‚Äô‚Äò tell anything to any man. Like Mark, Matthew presents Mary and Mary as being instructed by the tomb's occupant to inform the disciples, but unlike Mark's account they happily do so, and Peter has no special status amongst the others. Luke, again, merely presents Mary and Mary as telling the eleven and the rest, but presents them as doing so apparently without being instructed. John's account is quite different: John only describes Mary as informing two people‚ÄîPeter and the Beloved Disciple, an individual that is usually considered to be a self-reference by the author of the gospel John.

Also in Lysons' Magna Britannia. (page clxv in the original) Slane Castle, Co. Meath, Ireland Baron Slane was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1370 for the Fleming family but forfeited in 1691.  Origins  The Flemings of Slane descend from Erchenbald, otherwise referred to as \\"Archembald le Fleming\\", of Bratton Fleming, Devon, who was alive in 1087. Archembald derived his surname due to his birth in Flanders, and came to England during the reign of William I. He was succeeded by his son, Stephen (fl. 1145), whose son, Archembald, arrived in Ireland with Henry II in 1171 and participated in Hugh de Lacy's plantation of the Kingdom of Mide. On the west side of the hill of Slane there are the remains of a 12th-century motte and bailey which was the settlement, destroyed by the Irish in 1176. Succeeding Flemings were Stephen, (died ‚Äì1214) and Baldwin (died 1260). Baldwin's son, Richard, is the first of whom some substantial information exists. He married Mary/Maria Martin, daughter of Sir Nicholas FitzMartin the Younger (died 1260). Richard died in 1301, but it is unknown when his wife died. Their son, Baldwin (died 1335), married Matilda/Maude de Genville, daughter of Sir Simon de Genville of Trim. They were the parents of Simon Fleming, 1st Baron Slane, who died on 13 September 1370. An unusual feature of the title was the ability of the holder to petition the Crown to transfer it: after the death of the 12th Baron in 1625, the 13th Baron successfully petitioned the Crown to transfer the title to his younger brother, since as a Roman Catholic priest he did not expect to live on or manage the family estate. He became Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin. Peerage Case, 1835 In the case \\"Slane Peerage case\\" brought before the House of Lords in 1835, evidence was submitted by the agent of the petitioner. New creation The 17th Baron, Christopher, was attainted in 1691 for fighting against William III. The title became dormant after the death of the 19th Baron in 1771, but claimants from junior lines continued to advance their claims into the 19th century. One such was James Ellis Fleming of Tuam, County Galway, who, in 1824, claimed descent from John, third son of Christoper, who succeeded in 1612. The title remains dormant.

His scientific work was in the area of nuclear physics.  Biography  Jerrold Zacharias was born on January 23, 1905 in Jacksonville, Florida. Zacharias was involved in both the Radiation Laboratory at MIT and the Manhattan Project. He helped build the MIT physics department after the war, and was responsible for recruiting Bruno Rossi and Victor Weisskopf to the Institute. During the Cold War he was the head of a number of defense-related studies hosted at MIT (Project Hartwell, Project Charles, Project Lamp Light) and later he both founded and ran the Physical Science Study Committee, which was influential in changing physics education in the United States in the wake of Sputnik (1957). Zacharias also developed the first practical version of the cesium-beam clock, often called an \\"atomic clock,\\" which later became the internationally accepted standard for timekeeping. In 1954 he testified at the security clearance hearing of J. Robert Oppenheimer, where he was accused of being part of a cabal known as \\"ZORC\\" (Zacharias, Oppenheimer, Rabi, Charles Lauritsen) that was attempting to do damage to U.S. national security. (On the contrary, Zacharias did much research to aid national defense.) He was later investigated by agents of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He did not cooperate with them and consequently there was fear that he might lose his job. He was awarded the Oersted Medal in 1961. During the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, Zacharias worked for the White House's Office of Science and Technology.

Samples of the video signal storage grooves on a TED video disc. Enlarged 2000 times for exhibitional purposes. Television Electronic Disc (TeD) is a discontinued video recording format, released in 1975 by Telefunken and Teldec. The format used flexible foil discs, which spun at 1,500 rpm on a cushion of air. TeD never gained wide acceptance, and could not compete against the emerging videocassette systems of the time. History Initially known as, \\"The Video Disc\\" or the Teldec Television Disc, TeD (Television Electronic Disc) was first announced at a press conference in Berlin on June 24, 1970. It was developed by a team from two German companies: AEG-Telefunken and Teldec. Program information was stored in the form of ridges in the surface of a thin, flexible foil disc, which was claimed to be sufficiently robust to withstand being played 1,000 times. The main technological breakthrough was the vertical recording method that reduced the track pitch to 0.007 mm, and increased the rotation speed to 1,500 rpm, making it possible to record 130‚Äì150 grooves per millimeter, compared with the typical 10‚Äì13 grooves on an audio disc. This increased the available bandwidth from around 15 kHz to 3 MHz. The tracks were read by a pressure pick-up, which translated the surface of the ridges, via a piezo-electric crystal, into an electrical signal. Tracking was controlled not by the pick-up resting within the walls of a groove, but by a mechanical coupling on which the pick-up mounting is supported. There was no turntable. The rotation of the disc at 1,500 rpm created a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate. Vertical movement of the disc was kept to within 0.05mm. Eight-inch discs could store five minutes of programming, twelve-inch discs about 7¬Ω minutes. Marketing By autumn 1972, the name of the system had just been changed to TeD (for Television Disc) and the playing time of the eight-inch disc had been doubled to 10 minutes. TeD players were finally introduced on the West German market on 17 March 1975. Six labels offered programs: Decca, Teldec Intertel, Telefunken, Ufa/ATB, Ullstein AV and Videophon. Within the first three months 6,000 players had been shipped to 2,500 dealers, and 50,000 discs were in the shops. Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. of Japan, which had been conducting similar research itself (but was by now also developing the V-Cord videocassette recorder), was granted a licence to produce a version that would play out in the NTSC television format and by the end of 1976 had devised a long-awaited auto-changer that took 12 10-minute discs. Also in Japan, General Corporation took a manufacturing licence in July 1976 with an expectation of coming to market in April 1977. A software consortium, Nippon Video Systems, was formed around the same time. By the end of 1978 Telefunken itself had adopted VHS.

Gateway Theatre from the intersection of Lawrence and Milwaukee Avenues Route description True to its name, the street, which began as a Native American trail, eventually leads north to the state of Wisconsin and through Kenosha and Racine towards Milwaukee, though not directly. Starting with a short section at N. Canal and W. Lake Streets, it begins in earnest at the corner of N Desplaines and W. Kinzie Streets and heads northwest for about before joining Skokie Highway (U.S. Route 41) in Gurnee, Illinois, which eventually merges at Interstate 94 where Skokie Highway and the Tri-State Tollway split off, continuing to Milwaukee. From Harlem Avenue northwards it is Illinois Route 21. Milwaukee Avenue is a popular route for bicyclists. The southeastern end of Milwaukee Avenue is the most heavily bicycled stretch of road in Chicago, with cyclists accounting for 22% of all traffic there on a randomly selected day in September. The street is lined with storefronts, restaurants and the occasional art gallery through most of the city. The CTA's Blue Line runs beneath or alongside Milwaukee Avenue from its beginning at Canal and Lake Streets out to Logan Boulevard, with stations at Grand Avenue, Chicago Avenue, Division Street, Damen Avenue (in the Wicker Park neighborhood), Western Avenue, California Avenue and Logan Square. The Kennedy Expressway (Interstate 90) roughly parallels Milwaukee Avenue as well. Libertyville Just north of Armitage it passes the Chicago Landmark Congress Theater and at Addison Street it passes the Chicago Landmark Schurz High School. Past Irving Park Road it turns more northerly and the Blue Line crosses again at the Jefferson Park station passing the Gateway Theatre. It exits the city at about Albion Avenue and enters Niles, Illinois. (A very brief stretch later reenters the Chicago city limits, located southwest of the intersection of Harlem & Howard avenues; the street is in Niles on either side of this stretch). At Golf Road it passes the Golf Mill Shopping Center. It crosses the Des Plaines River just south of the Chicago Executive Airport. From thence it roughly follows the Des Plaines River north, passing through such communities as Wheeling, Lincolnshire, Vernon Hills, and Libertyville, where it forms the historic core of Libertyville's downtown area. It continues on past Gurnee before merging with the Skokie Highway near Wadsworth. Wicker Park Milwaukee Avenue runs through the commercial heart of Chicago's vibrant and trendy Wicker Park and Bucktown neighborhoods. The Double Door theater and Irazu Costa Rica Restaurant front the avenue in this section. On an episode of Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, host Guy Fieri walks from the Milwaukee Avenue pavement to Irazu's outdoor patio to sample the food for the TV audience.http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/chicharron-at- irazu-0173487.embed.html Sections of the movie High Fidelity were filmed in buildings along Milwaukee Avenue, including the Double Door and the fictional record store that is the nexus of the character's lives. Although the movie Wicker Park was filmed in Canada, the story is set in this area of Wicker Park, Chicago. The busy six corner intersection of Damen Avenue, North Avenue, and Milwaukee is the center of the \\"24 hour\\" Wicker Park scene with dozens of bars and restaurants, making for popular nightlife. The Flat Iron Arts Center, built in 1913 and designed by Holabird & Roche, is sited at this intersection. In 2015, the Spike Lee movie Chiraq was being filmed in Chicago, with a scene including rapper actor Nick Cannon filmed at the Double Door on Milwaukee Avenue. The movie palace Congress Theater, a designed Chicago landmark built in 1926, is located at 2135 N. Milwaukee. Logan Square Logan square in 1993 Just northwest of Bucktown, Milwaukee Avenue traverses the heart of Logan Square, Chicago, a gentrifying neighborhood. Milwaukee Avenue runs on a diagonal through the parkway of the boulevards, Logan Boulevard and Kedzie Avenue at a traffic circle surrounding the Illinois Centennial Monument. Chicago's Polish Corridor Polish store along Pulaski Rd. in Jackowo While Milwaukee Avenue has been a route of chain migration for various ethnicities, it is particularly associated with Chicago's Poles who have dominated vast areas of the city which Milwaukee Avenue cuts through. Numerous Polish Patches dotted the cityscape in its vicinity, from Polish Downtown near Polonia Triangle through the Polish Village in Avondale and the adjacent Villa District which journalist Mike Royko christened as \\"Polish Kenilworth\\". The street was once used as part of the route for the Polish Constitution Day Parade as well as Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit to Chicago. Numerous Polish churches, shops, and cultural organizations such as the Copernicus Foundation, the Chopin Theatre, the Society for Arts, and the Polish Daily News still make their home along Milwaukee Avenue, continuing its Polish presence to the present day. A stretch of Milwaukee Avenue in Niles, Illinois was renamed in honor of Wojciech Seweryn in 2011, the Chicago area artist who died in the plane crash that killed the Polish president and dozens of other Polish leaders in Smolensk, Russia.

Focusing on the goal of having talented personnel with strong business skills, leadership potential and career aspirations, SEC recognized the compelling need for high-quality leaders, hence the Global Scholarship Program was created to nurture a very selectively compiled group of individuals, who later in the long run might become leaders (\\"Future Global Leaders\\") of the various SEC subsidiaries around the world, replacing the Korean-national management layer (what is the usual practice at the chaebol). It differs from Samsung Scholarship, formerly known as Samsung Lee Kun-hee Scholarship for supporting exceptionally talented Korean university students for global educations in mostly STEM(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Divided into two paths, both programs originally selected participants who demonstrate academic excellence and leadership potential and provides them with unique opportunities for further professional development. Starting from 2011, GSP-SKK instead contains employees working in the subsidiaries. The program also provides young leaders with a unique international network through which they can share ideas, learn from established leaders, work collaboratively and address global challenges. By exposing participants to the complex issues and opportunities arising from an increasingly interdependent global economy, the program aims to expand perspectives and enhance skills critical for leadership in a changing world. Scholarship program Each year 15-25 individuals from different parts of the globe are offered to take part in the program that has two distinctive paths: an engineer and an MBA track: * GSP (M.S. Program) through Seoul National University (SNU) * GSP (M.B.A. Program) through SungKyunKwan University's Graduate School of Business (SKK GSB) [in collaboration with MIT Sloan] The (Global) MBA program is notable for its diversity and pioneer nature. It was built and now run together with MIT Sloan since its foundation, and it was the first global English-only MBA program in Korea. Selected GSP students currently study for three semesters. It used to be four semesters, including a possibility of spending a semester at one of SKK GSB's top partner universities in the U.S. (MIT Sloan, Columbia, Northwestern's Kellogg, Michigan's Ross, Dartmouth's Tuck or Indiana's Kelly). SKK GSB Global MBA has been recently ranked by the Financial Times as the #1 MBA in Korea, Top 10 in Asia and 45th worldwide. The significance of the program can also be seen from the wide range of students who, as it was already in the first years, came from the leading companies including Cheil Communications, Amore Pacific, Woori Bank, POSCO, SK, Kyobo, Everland, Bosch, KTF and several Samsung subsidiaries. After graduation, participants are offered various responsibilities at Samsung Electronics and although some elected to follow a different career path (at management consultancies, for instance) many participants stayed with SEC.

It is one of several catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) known to occur in nature. It serves as a model system for research on the structure and properties of RNA, and is used for targeted RNA cleavage experiments, some with proposed therapeutic applications. Named for the resemblance of early secondary structure diagrams to a hammerhead shark, hammerhead ribozymes were originally discovered in two classes of plant virus-like RNAs: satellite RNAs and viroids. They have subsequently been found to be widely dispersed within many forms of life. The self-cleavage reactions, first reported in 1986, are part of a rolling circle replication mechanism. The hammerhead sequence is sufficient for self-cleavage and acts by forming a conserved three-dimensional tertiary structure. Catalysis In its natural state, a hammerhead RNA motif is a single strand of RNA. Although the cleavage takes place in the absence of protein enzymes, the hammerhead RNA itself is not a catalyst in its natural state, as it is consumed by the reaction (i.e. performs self-cleavage) and therefore cannot catalyze multiple turnovers. Trans-acting hammerhead constructs can be engineered such that they consist of two interacting RNA strands, with one strand composing a hammerhead ribozyme that cleaves the other strand. The strand that gets cleaved can be supplied in excess, and multiple turnover can be demonstrated and shown to obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics, typical of protein enzyme kinetics. Such constructs are typically employed for in vitro experiments, and the term \\"hammerhead RNA\\" has become in practice synonymous with the more frequently used \\"hammerhead ribozyme\\". The minimal trans-acting hammerhead ribozyme sequence that is catalytically active consists of three base-paired stems flanking a central core of 15 conserved (mostly invariant) nucleotides, as shown. The conserved central bases, with few exceptions, are essential for ribozyme‚Äôs catalytic activity. Such hammerhead ribozyme constructs exhibit in vitro a turnover rate (kcat) of about 1 molecule/minute and a Km on the order of 10 nanomolar. The hammerhead ribozyme is arguably the best-characterized ribozyme. Its small size, thoroughly-investigated cleavage chemistry, known crystal structure, and its biological relevance make the hammerhead ribozyme particularly well-suited for biochemical and biophysical investigations into the fundamental nature of RNA catalysis. Hammerhead ribozymes may play an important role as therapeutic agents; as enzymes which tailor defined RNA sequences, as biosensors, and for applications in functional genomics and gene discovery. Species distribution In 1986, the first hammerhead ribozymes were found in RNA plant pathogens like viroids and viral satellites. One year later, a hammerhead ribozyme was also reported in the satellite DNA of newt genomes. New examples of this ribozyme were then found in the genomes of unrelated organisms like schistosomes, cave crickets, Arabidopsis thaliana and a few mammals like rodents and the platypus. In 2010, it was found that the hammerhead ribozyme occurs in a wide variety of bacterial and eukaryal genomes, and even in humans. Similar reports confirmed and extended these observations, unveiling the hammerhead ribozyme as a ubiquitous catalytic RNA in all life kingdoms. In eukaryotic genomes, many of the detected hammerhead ribozymes seem to be related to short interspersed retroelements (SINEs), with the exception of a family of strikingly conserved hammerheads found in the genomes of all amniotes. These hammerhead ribozymes (the so-called HH9 and HH10) occur in the introns of a few specific genes and point to a preserved biological role during pre-mRNA biosynthesis Chemistry of catalysis The hammerhead ribozyme carries out a very simple chemical reaction that results in the breakage of the substrate strand of RNA, specifically at C17, the cleavage- site nucleotide. Although RNA cleavage is often referred to as hydrolysis, the mechanism employed does not in fact involve the addition of water. Rather, the cleavage reaction is simply an isomerization that consists of rearrangement of the linking phosphodiester bond. It is the same reaction, chemically, that occurs with random base-mediated RNA degradation, except that it is highly site-specific and the rate is accelerated 10,000-fold or more. Cleavage by phosphodiester isomerization In-line transition-state for the hammerhead ribozyme reaction. A general base (B) abstracts a proton from the 2'-O, and a general acid (A), supplies a proton to the 5'-O leaving group as negative charge accumulates. The reaction product is a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate. The bonds breaking (shown in red) and forming (dashed lines) must be in the axial positions and reside approximately 180¬∞ apart, as shown. Electron movements are represented by curly arrows. The cleavage reaction is a phosphodiester isomerization reaction that is initiated by abstraction of the cleavage-site ribose 2‚Äô-hydroxyl proton from the 2‚Äô-oxygen, which then becomes the attacking nucleophile in an ‚Äúin-line‚Äù or SN2(P)-like reaction, although it is not known whether this proton is removed prior to or during the chemical step of the hammerhead cleavage reaction. (The cleavage reaction is technically not bimolecular, but behaves in the same way a genuine SN2(P) reaction does; it undergoes inversion of configuration subsequent to forming an associative transition-state consisting of a pentacoordinated oxyphosphrane.) The attacking and leaving group oxygens will both occupy the two axial positions in the trigonal bipyramidal transition-state structure as is required for an SN2-like reaction mechanism. The 5‚Äô-product, as a result of this cleavage reaction mechanism, possesses a 2‚Äô,3‚Äô-cyclic phosphate terminus, and the 3‚Äô-product possesses a 5‚Äô-OH terminus, as with nonenzymatic alkaline cleavage of RNA. The reaction is therefore reversible, as the scissile phosphate remains a phosphodiester, and may thus act as a substrate for hammerhead RNA- mediated ligation without a requirement for ATP or a similar exogenous energy source. The hammerhead ribozyme-catalyzed reaction, unlike the formally identical non-enzymatic alkaline cleavage of RNA, is a highly sequence- specific cleavage reaction with a typical turnover rate of approximately 1 molecule of substrate per molecule of enzyme per minute at pH 7.5 in 10 mM Mg2+ (so-called ‚Äústandard reaction conditions‚Äù for the minimal hammerhead RNA sequence), depending upon the sequence of the particular hammerhead ribozyme construct measured. This represents an approximately 10,000-fold rate enhancement over the nonezymatic cleavage of RNA. Requirement for divalent metal ions All ribozymes were originally thought to be metallo-enzymes. It was assumed that divalent metal ions like Mg2+ were thought to have two roles: Promote proper folding of RNA and to form the catalytic core. Since RNA itself did not contain enough variation in the functional groups, metal ions were thought to play a role at the active site, as was known about proteins. The proposed mechanism for the Mg2+ ion was: the deprotonation of the 2'-OH group by a Magnesium.aqua.hydroxy complex bound by the pro-R oxygen at the phosphate-cleavage site, followed by nucleophilic attack of the resultant 2'-alkaoxide on the scissile phosphate forming a pentacoordinate phosphate intermediate. The last step is the departing of the 5' leaving group, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate with an inverted configuration. It was presumed that hexahydrated magnesium ions, which exist in equilibrium with magnesium hydroxide, could play the roles of general acid and general base, in a way analogous to those played by two histidines in RNase A. An additional role for divalent metal ions has also been proposed in the form of electrostatic stabilization of the transition-state. Not a metallo-enzyme In 1998 it was discovered that the hammerhead ribozyme, as well as the VS ribozyme and hairpin ribozyme, do not require the presence of metal ions for catalysis, provided a sufficiently high concentration of monovalent cation is present to permit the RNA to fold. This discovery suggested that the RNA itself, rather than serving as an inert, passive scaffold for the binding of chemically active divalent metal ions, is instead itself intimately involved in the chemistry of catalysis. The latest structural results, described below, indeed confirm that two invariant nucleotides, G12 and G8, are positioned consistent with roles as the general base and general acid in the hammerhead cleavage reaction. Strictly speaking, therefore, the hammerhead ribozyme cannot be a metallo-enzyme. Primary and secondary structure Secondary structures and sequences of the minimal (A) and full-length (B) hammerhead ribozymes. Conserved and invariant nucleotides are shown explicitly. Watson-Crick base- paired helical stems are represented as ladder-like drawings. The red arrow depicts the cleavage site, 3' to C17, on each construct. Minimal ribozyme The minimal hammerhead sequence that is required for the self- cleavage reaction includes approximately 13 conserved or invariant \\"core\\" nucleotides, most of which are not involved in forming canonical Watson-Crick base-pairs. The core region is flanked by Stems I, II and III, which are in general made of canonical Watson-Crick base-pairs but are otherwise not constrained with respect to sequence. The catalytic turnover rate of minimal hammerhead ribozymes is ~ 1/min (a range of 0.1/min to 10/min is commonly observed, depending upon the nonconserved sequences and the lengths of the three helical stems) under standard reaction conditions of high Mg2+ (~10 mM), pH 7.5 and 25 ¬∞C. Much of the experimental work carried out on hammerhead ribozymes has used a minimal construct. =Type I, type II and type III hammerhead RNA= Structurally the hammerhead ribozyme is composed of three base paired helices, separated by short linkers of conserved sequences. These helices are called I, II and III. Hammerhead ribozymes can be classified into three types based on which helix the 5' and 3' ends are found in. If the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence contribute to stem I then it is a type I hammerhead ribozyme, to stem II is a type II and to stem III then it is a type III hammerhead ribozyme. Of the three possible topological types, type I can be found in the genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes and RNA plant pathogens, whereas type II have been only described in prokaryotes and type III are mostly found in plants, plant pathogens and prokaryotes. Full-length ribozyme The full-length hammerhead ribozyme consists of additional sequence elements in stems I and II that permit additional tertiary contacts to form. The tertiary interactions stabilize the active conformation of the ribozyme, resulting in cleavage rates up to 1000-fold greater than those for corresponding minimal hammerhead sequences. Tertiary structure=Minimal The crystal structure of a minimal hammerhead ribozyme The minimal hammerhead ribozyme has been exhaustively studied by biochemists and enzymologists as well as by X-ray crystallographers, NMR spectroscopists, and other practitioners of biophysical techniques. The first detailed three- dimensional structural information for a hammerhead ribozyme appeared in 1994 in the form of an X-ray crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme bound to a DNA substrate analogue, published in Nature by Pley, Flaherty and McKay. Subsequently, an all-RNA minimal hammerhead ribozyme structure was published by Scott, Finch and Klug in Cell in early 1995. The minimal hammerhead ribozyme is composed of three base paired helices, separated by short linkers of conserved sequence as shown in the crystal structure. These helices are called I, II and III. The conserved uridine-turn links helix I to helix II and usually contains the sequence CUGA. Helix II and III are linked by a sequence GAAA. The cleavage reaction occurs between helix III and I, and is usually a C. The structure of a full length ribozyme shows that there are extensive interactions between the loop of stem II and stem I. Structure-function Despite the observations of hammerhead ribozyme catalysis in a crystal of the minimal hammerhead sequence in which the crystal lattice packing contacts by necessity confined the global positions of the distal termini of all three flanking helical stems, many biochemical experiments designed to probe transition-state interactions and the chemistry of catalysis appeared to be irreconcilable with the crystal structures. For example, the invariant core residues G5, G8, G12 and C3 in the minimal hammerhead ribozyme were each observed to be so fragile that changing even a single exocyclic functional group on any one of these nucleotides results in a dramatic reduction or abolition of catalytic activity, yet few of these appeared to form hydrogen bonds involving the Watson-Crick faces of these nucleotide bases in any of the minimal hammerhead structures, apart from a G-5 interaction in the product structure. A particularly striking and only recently observed example consisted of G8 and G12, which were identified as possible participants in acid/base catalysis. Once it was demonstrated that the hammerhead RNA does not require divalent metal ions for catalysis, it gradually became apparent that the RNA itself, rather than passively bound divalent metal ions, must play a direct chemical role in any acid-base chemistry in the hammerhead ribozyme active site. It was however completely unclear how G12 and G8 could accomplish this, given the original structures of the minimal hammerhead ribozyme. Other concerns included an NOE between U4 and U7 of the cleaved hammerhead ribozyme that had also been observed during NMR characterization, which suggested that these nucleotide bases must approach one another closer than about 6 √Ö, although close approach of U7 to U4 did not appear to be possible from the crystal structure. Finally, as previously discussed, the attacking nucleophile in the original structures, the 2‚Äô-OH of C17, was not in a position amenable to in-line attack upon the adjacent scissile phosphate. Perhaps most worrisome were experiments that suggested the A-9 and scissile phosphates must come within about 4 √Ö of one another in the transition-state, based upon double phosphorothioate substitution and soft metal ion rescue experiments; the distance between these phosphates in the minimal hammerhead crystal structure was about 18 √Ö, with no clear mechanism for close approach if the Stem II and Stem I A-form helices were treated as rigid bodies. Taken together, these results appeared to suggest that a fairly large-scale conformational change must have taken place in order to reach the transition-state within the minimal hammerhead ribozyme structure. For these reasons, the two sets of experiments (biochemical vs. crystallographic) appeared not only to be at odds, but to be completely and hopelessly irreconcilable, generating a substantial amount of discord in the field. No compelling evidence for dismissing either set of experimental results was ever made successfully, although many claims to the contrary were made in favor of each. Full- length Three-dimensional structure of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme In 2006 a 2.2 √Ö resolution crystal structure of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme was obtained. This new structure (shown on the right) appears to resolve the most worrisome of the previous discrepancies. In particular, C17 is now positioned for in-line attack, and the invariant residues C3, G5, G8 and G12 all appear involved in vital interactions relevant to catalysis. Moreover, the A9 and scissile phosphates are observed to be 4.3 √Ö apart, consistent with the idea that, when modified, these phosphates could bind a single thiophilic metal ion. The structure also reveals how two invariant residues, G-12 and G-8, are positioned within the active site consistent with their previously proposed role in acid/base catalysis. G12 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the 2‚Äô‚ÄìO of C17, the nucleophile in the cleavage reaction, and the ribose of G8 hydrogen bonds to the leaving group 5‚Äô-O. (see below), while the nucleotide base of G8 forms a Watson-Crick pair with the invariant C3. This arrangement permits one to suggest that G12 is the general base in the cleavage reaction, and that G8 may function as the general acid, consistent with previous biochemical observations. G5 hydrogen bonds to the furanose oxygen of C17, helping to position it for in-line attack. U4 and U7, as a consequence of the base-pair formation between G8 and C3, are now positioned such that an NOE between their bases is easily explained. The crystal structure of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme thus clearly addresses all of the major concerns that appeared irreconcilable with the previous crystal structures of the minimal hammerhead ribozyme. Structure and catalysis The active site of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme. G12 is positioned consistent with a role as a general base in the cleavage reaction, and the 2'-OH of G8 is positioned for acid catalysis. Potentially \\"active\\" hydrogen bonds are shown as orange dotted lines. The 2'-O of C17 is shown to be aligned for nucleophilic attack along the blue dotted line trajectory. The tertiary interactions in the full-length hammerhead ribozyme stabilize what strongly appears to be the active conformation. The nucleophile, the 2'-oxygen of the cleavage-site nucleotide, C17, is aligned almost perfectly for an in- line attack (the SN2(P) reaction). G12 is positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of this nucleophile, and therefore would be able to abstract a proton from the 2'-oxygen if G12 itself becomes deprotonated. The 2'-OH of G8 forms a hydrogen bond to the 5'-leaving group oxygen, and therefore potentially may supply a proton as negative charge accumulates on the 5'-oxygen of the ribose of A1.1. The most likely explanation is then that G12, in the deprotonated form, is the general base, and the ribose of G8 is the general acid. The apparent kinetic pKa of the hammerhead ribozyme is 8.5, whereas the pKa of guanosine is about 9.5. It is possible that the pKa of G12 is perturbed from 9.5 to 8.5 in the hammerhead catalytic core; this hypothesis is currently the subject of intense investigation. Possible transition-state interactions as extrapolated from the crystal structure. If the invariant G8 is changed to C8, hammerhead catalysis is abolished. However, a G8C + C3G double-mutant that maintains the G8-C3 base pair found in the full-length hammerhead restores most of the catalytic activity. The 2'-OH of G8 has also been observed to be essential for catalysis; replacement of G8 with deoxyG8 greatly reduces the rate of catalysis, suggesting the 2'-OH is indeed crucial to the catalytic mechanism. The close approach of the A9 and scissile phosphates requires the presence of a high concentration of positive charge. This is probably the source of the observation that divalent metal ions are required at low ionic strength, but can be dispensed with at higher concentrations of monovalent cations. The reaction thus likely involves abstraction of the 2'-proton from C17, followed by nucleophilic attack upon the adjacent phosphate. As the bond between the scissile phosphorus and the 5'-O leaving group begins to break, a proton is supplied from the ribose of G8, which then likely reprotonates at the expense of a water molecule observed to hydrogen bond to it in the crystal structure. Therapeutic applications Modified hammerhead ribozymes are being tested as therapeutic agents. Synthetic RNAs containing sequences complementary to the mutant SOD1 mRNA and sequences necessary to form the hammerhead catalytic structure are being studied as a possible therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Work is also underway to find out whether they could be used to engineer HIV-resistant lines of T-cells. Modified hammerhead ribozyme adenoviruses have been shown to be potent in treating cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic use of trans-cleaving hammerhead ribozymes has been severely hampered by its low-level activity in vivo. The true catalytic potential of trans-cleaving hammerhead ribozymes may be recouped in vivo and therapeutic derivatives are likely to complement other nucleic acid hybridizing therapeutic strategies. Already there are hammerhead ribozymes which are close to clinical application.

The channel is programmed by Don Wicklin. America Left (2004-2005) Channel 167 originally started out as America Left, a channel dedicated to progressive talk radio to complement the reformatted XM 166, America Right. It launched on March 31, 2004, and the lineup included hosts like Ed Schultz, Randi Rhodes, Al Franken, Marty Kaplan, Janeane Garofalo, Alan Colmes, Lizz Winstead and Chuck D. At the time, both Sirius and XM had centrist/progressive talk channels featuring talent from Air America Radio. The lineup was constant for over a year. One complaint often voiced was that two afternoon drive hosts, Ed Schultz and Randi Rhodes, each had an hour of their shows cut off to keep both shows on and live. On April 11, 2005, XM and Air America announced that XM would become the exclusive satellite radio provider of the network, excluding Air America Syndication, beginning in May 2005. This forced Sirius to rid itself of all Air America Radio network programming. XM167's lineup didn't make any immediate lineup changes, but it did rebrand itself using the Air America name. Non-AAR hosts Ed Schultz and Alan Colmes remained on the channel. Air America Radio (2005-2008) America Left took on its new name, Air America Radio, to boast the fact that XM was the exclusive provider. No lineup changes were made until September 2005, when Ed Schultz was moved over to Clear Channel's advice talker, Ask! on 165. This allowed Randi Rhodes to broadcast her entire show every afternoon. At the end of the year, Alan Colmes also made the move to the new Fox News Talk, a channel owned and operated by Fox News Radio. For the first time, Air America Radio on XM was now 100% Air America content on weekdays. A Best of Stephanie Miller segment was carried on Sunday mornings. There were lineup changes occurring across the Air America Network that were reflected onto XM 167, such as Mike Malloy and Janeane Garofalo's departures, the end of Morning Sedition, and the hiring of The Young Turks. Some questioned the financial state of the network and whether or not XM was wise in paying for the exclusive rights to satellite broadcasting. More information on Air America's company state can be found in its article, including the company's bankruptcy and sale. Old faces return In 2007, XM announced that Ed Schultz, who was airing on Extreme XM on delay and truncated to two separate hours, was going to be returning to XM 167 to fill the timeslot being vacated by Al Franken. This allowed Schultz to return to the full three hours in a live timeslot. Some were not happy about this move as it prevented Thom Hartmann from taking the slot on the channel, prompting midday host Sam Seder to ask his listeners to call XM to complain. Schultz responded on air the next day claiming that \\"Air America sucks, their programs suck, they give liberals a bad name,\\" and recommended that XM play other Jones radio hosts Stephanie Miller and Bill Press on channel 167. Schultz kept the timeslot, and Hartmann's show was eventually added to the channel's schedule. Bill Press and Stephanie Miller would be added later in 2008. In addition to Schultz, XM exclusive shows The Agenda and Left Jab were added to XM 167 weekends. These moves have led listeners to question XM's confidence in the Air America Radio network, as ex-AAR host and current Nova M Radio host Mike Malloy returned to the channel in July, weeknights at 9 PM eastern. With this rescheduling, XM moved Thom Hartmann from midnight to 6:00 PM eastern and the Air Americans, which previously aired in that time to midnight. Despite being on a channel with the \\"Air America Radio\\" label, Schultz stated on February 13, 2007 that Air America \\"sucks\\" and he doesn't want people who listen to AAR listening to him because he is \\"better than they are.\\" These comment were in response to remarks by AAR host Sam Seder, who asked his listeners to call XM and request Thom Hartmann instead of Schultz. Seder's reasoning for his action is that he believes AAR hosts should be on the 'Air America Radio' channel. Hartmann was added to the channel beginning March 5, 2007, on a tape-delay basis at Midnight ET, and has since moved to an earlier time slot on the channel. In April 2007, XM Radio Canada added the channel to its lineup unannounced, making Air America programs available in Canada. The AAR network has also announced that Sam Seder will become a Sunday host only, and has scheduled WOR talker Lionel to replace him. Eco-Talk has also been dropped by the network in favor for a four-hour Mark Riley program, and Jon Elliot doing midnights. XM has indicated that they will schedule Lionel and Seder's new timeslots. In July 2007, Air America Radio let go of its top-of-the-hour news staff. Their reason was most AAR affiliates don't use AAR News at the top of the hour, opting for local news or another national service like CNN Radio. XM 167 was one of the few that used AAR News, and upon their removal, switched to AP Radio News. AAR loses more time as cuts are made Towards the end of 2007, the Young Turks were cut from the Air America lineup, claiming it was a mutual understanding. The trio plans a return through internet radio. In the meantime, XM Radio added its second Jones Radio personality, Bill Press, to the morning drive timeslot. Although The Rachel Maddow Show expanded from two to three hours on March 10, 2008, XM 167 does not broadcast the third hour, instead playing a taped Thom Hartmann program. This became moot on September 8, 2008, when The Rachel Maddow Show returned to a two-hour format. In April 2008, Randi Rhodes performed at an event in San Francisco sponsored by local affiliate KKGN, which included crude remarks made at Hillary Clinton as part of a comedy routine. This resulted in Air America suspending Rhodes from the network. She claimed that the network was in breach of her contract, and ended up resigning from Air America. Within 24 hours, it was announced that Nova M Radio was picking up her show nationally, and hopes to retain as many affiliates as possible. XM 167 continued to run AAR programming in afternoons until a deal with Nova M Radio was made. On 2008-05-05, XM resumed broadcasting Randi Rhodes' show on Air America Radio channel 167. With this addition, the channel known as \\"Air America Radio\\" now only carried 13 hours of AAR programming per day, with 2 hours being distribution only, and only 7 of those hours in the daypart timeslots. America Left (2008-2011) On June 18, 2008, XM announced that Air America Radio would be changing its name back to America Left, beginning July 14. The channel kept most of its lineup, however, Lionel was replaced by Jones Radio's Stephanie Miller. In addition, The Young Turks returned to the channel. After the SiriusXM merger, the co- owned SIRIUS Left did not join the channel merger on November 12, 2008. Since February 2009, however, several SIRIUS Left shows have joined the America Left lineup, and all remaining Air America Media shows have been dropped. Nevertheless, the majority of America Left programming still consists of shows of former Air Americans: Mike Malloy, Thom Hartmann (twice a day), Bill Press, and the Young Turks. (Randi Rhodes' official site http://www.RandiRhodes.com has said America Left has carried her show live since just after her return to the air with Premiere Radio Networks.) On January 21, 2010, Air America Media announced that it would file for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and ceased all live broadcasting that same evening. Sirius XM Progress (2011-) On May 4, 2011, America Left (XM 167) and Sirius Left (Sirius 146) merged to become SiriusXM Left and aired on channel 127 on both services. With the merger, a second channel SiriusXM Left Plus with timeshifting and additional airings of SiriusXM Left shows also started on online channel 853. On July 22, 2013, SiriusXM Left was renamed SiriusXM Progress. Along with the name change, several changes were made to the lineup. The Agenda with Ari Rabin Havt replaced Bill Press at 6:00-9:00 AM EST, Michelangelo Signorile replaced Thom Hartmann at 3:00-6:00 PM EST and Make It Plain with Mark Thompson replaced Alex Bennett at 6:00-9:00 PM EST. At the same time, SiriusXM Progress Plus, an online station also available through a smartphone app continued to air both Press and Hartmann at their regular times, as well as the usual lineup, though the showtimes differed slightly from those on the main Progress channel.

His greatest competitive achievement was winning the U.S. Open Championship in 1948. He played in the U.S. Championship five times. Adams is most famous for his controversial claim that the first move 1.e4 confers a winning advantage upon White. He continually advocated this theory in books and magazine articles from 1939 until shortly before his death. Adams' claim has generally been scorned by the chess world. However, International Master Hans Berliner in a 1999 book professed admiration for Adams, and similarly claimed that White may claim a winning advantage, albeit with 1.d4, not 1.e4. Adams did not succeed in showing the validity of his theory in his own tournament and match play. His results suffered because he published his analysis of White's supposed winning lines, thus forfeiting the element of surprise and enabling his opponents to prepare responses to his pet lines. Future World Champion Bobby Fischer used the Adams Attack, the line Adams advocated against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense (6.h3), with success. Playing career Weaver Adams was one of the leading American masters during the 1930s and 1940s.Grandmaster Arnold Denker and Larry Parr listed Adams as one of 17 leading American masters during the years of the Great Depression. Denker and Parr 1995, p. 200. He played in the U.S. Championship in 1936,http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA- ch_1st_1936/28424 1940,http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1940/28636 1944,http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1021448 1946,http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1946/28854 and 1948.http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/USA-ch_1948/28970 He won the Massachusetts State Championship in 1937, 1938, 1941, and 1945.Massachusetts State Champions In 1944, he won a master tournament in Ventnor City.Milton L. Hanauer, Chess Made Simple, Doubleday, 1957, p. 180. He also won the Marshall Chess Club championship six times, and the New York State championship four times.Evans, 1970, p. 146 (quoting letter by Adams published in Chess Life, November 1961). Adams' greatest competitive success was winning the 49th U.S. Open, held in Baltimore in 1948, for which achievement he appeared on the cover of the August 1948 issue of Chess Review magazine.Chess Review, August 1948, at cover, 4, 6. Also available on DVD (pages 251, 256, 258 in \\"Chess Review 1948\\" PDF file on DVD). Adams played in the 1950‚Äì51 Hastings Christmas Chess Congress, but finished 9th out of 10 players with 2¬Ω/9 (two wins, six losses, one draw). Grandmaster Larry Evans wrote that Adams' \\"tournament results were damaged by his dogmatism. Playing under the self-inflicted handicap of arming his opponents with advance knowledge of his 'best' lines, he felt honor-bound to steer straight into them even though his adversary invariably had a cook up his sleeve. By the time Weaver found a refutation and published it, another player found a different cook and so on ad infinitum.\\"Evans, 1970, pp. 146-47. According to Chess Review, this phenomenon may explain Adams' poor result at Hastings 1950‚Äì51.From Chess Review, February 1951, p. 35 (also available on DVD): > According to some reports, Adams ran into trouble when he played opening > lines which he has often publicized in connection with his theories on > 'White to play and win.' These variations, it is said, had been anticipated > by his rivals, who had prepared themselves with special analyses. If there > is any truth in this account the moral for a chess player would seem to be > the same as for a boxer‚Äînamely, never to 'telegraph' his favorite blows. White to play and win theory Adams was best known for his books and magazine articles in which he claimed and attempted to prove that White's first-move advantage is decisive, i.e. that White has a forced win from the starting position. His first and most famous book arguing this, White to Play and Win, was published in 1939. There, Adams claimed that 1.e4 was White's strongest move,Adams 1939, p. 5. and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter, \\"White ought to win.\\"Adams 1939, p. 10. If Black responded with 1 ... e5, Adams advocated the Bishop's Opening, 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4.Adams 1939, p. 55. Adams was unable to prove his theory in tournament or match practice. The year after his book was published, he played in the U.S. Open at Dallas, 1940. Ironically, in the finals he did not win a single game as White (three losses and one draw), but won all four of his games as Black. Also available on DVD (page 154 in \\"Chess Review 1940\\" PDF file on DVD). Adams also lost a match to IM I.A. Horowitz, who took the black pieces in every game.Chernev 1955, p. 461. Adams later wrote Simple Chess, which he revised several times; How to Play Chess; and Absolute Chess. Ultimately giving up on the Bishop's Opening, he switched to the Vienna Game, claiming a win with White after 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Qh5 Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5, a sharp line that has since been dubbed the Frankenstein‚ÄìDracula Variation. When Adams was also unsuccessful with this variation,Adams-H. Lyman, Boston 1946 he switched to other lines. In 1962, he advocated what he called the Adams Gambit, substituting 6.d4!? for 6.Nb5. He explained his repudiation of 6.Nb5: \\"it is antipositional to move a developed piece a second time, and masters have long given it up as hopeless.\\"Adams 1962. Adams' \\"White to Play and Win\\" thesis was widely ridiculed.Berliner 1999, p. 39. Larry Evans wrote that \\"Mr. Adams and his cronies may be linked to the radical right wing of chess. ... Weaver is not content with such halfway measures as equality. All or nothing‚Äîright-wing logic, true to form.\\"Evans 1962.Evans 1970, pp. 146‚Äì47 (quoting Evans' above- cited Chess Life article). However, IM Hans Berliner, a former world champion of correspondence chess, wrote that Adams' \\"theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was the first person I met who actually had theories about how chess should be played.\\" Berliner is himself a controversial figure, who argued in his 1999 book The System, that 1.d4 may win by force for White.Berliner 1999. Although Adams was rarely successful at the top levels, his ideas were studied and sometimes adopted by strong players. Future world champion Bobby Fischer scored notable wins using the Adams Attack against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.h3, preparing the pawn thrust g2‚Äìg4Games 35, 40, and 43 of Fischer's famous book My 60 Memorable Games are his wins with 6.h3 against world-class grandmasters Samuel Reshevsky and Miguel Najdorf, and future grandmaster Julio Bolboch√°n.

Fischer-Reshevsky, U.S. Championship 1962Fischer-Najdorf, Varna Olympiad 1962Fischer-Bolbochan, Stockholm Interzonal 1962, and that line continues to be played at the top level today. Personal life Adams' parents were Frank H. Adams and Ethel Weaver Adams. He wrote that he was not directly related to Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, but that the Adamses \\"in and about Massachusetts are mostly of the same family, deriving from a Henry Adams who landed in Braintree in 1644\\".Autobiography of Weaver W. Adams, reprinted from 1949 Massachusetts Chess Association publication edited by Robert W. Reddy, pp. 6-8. Both Weaver and Warren were his ancestral names. His mother's side has been traced back to the founding fathers of America. His father's side has not as yet been established. Grandmaster Arnold Denker related of Weaver that he was \\"a master who inherited a chicken farm and who was ‚Äì so to speak ‚Äì a White man clear through. He wrote a book, White to Play and Win, lived in a White house on White Street, chewed antacid pills that left the inside of his mouth perpetually White, and raised only white chickens that laid white eggs. Predictably, Adams' business was soon no more than a shell.\\"Denker and Parr 1995, p. 170. Harry Golombek wrote in 1977 that Adams, whom he described as \\"author of White to Play and Win and a sodium bicarbonate addict\\", was on Golombek's \\"reserves\\" list for \\"the ten most interesting personages\\" from the past 100 years.Chess Notes, No. 5215 Adams was homosexual, as discussed in his autobiographical article reprinted in Chess Pride.Johnson, 1998.

His published works include the Negro Year Book and A Bibliography of the Negro in Africa and America, a bibliography of approximately seventeen thousand references to African Americans. Life Work was born to former slaves in Iredell County, North Carolina, and moved in 1867 to Cairo, Illinois, where his father pursued farming. At the age of 23, Work entered Arkansas City High School (Kansas), an integrated high school in Arkansas City, Kansas. He graduated 3rd in his class, and after undergoing training at the Chicago Theological Seminary, he enrolled in the University of Chicago to become a sociologist. He did research on the correlation between the highest crime rates among blacks and the large proportion living in slums. His paper on the subject would become the first article published in the American Journal of Sociology by an African American. He finished school in Chicago with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and a Master of Arts degree in Sociology. After graduating in 1903, Work moved to Savannah, Georgia, to become a professor at Georgia State Industrial College. He married Florence E. Hendrickson of Savannah on December 27, 1904, and they had no children. In July 1905, Work attended the conference of the Niagara Movement at the invitation of W. E. B. Du Bois. In 1908, he accepted a proposal by Booker T. Washington to found the Department of Records and Research at the Tuskegee Institute. While there, he would begin the Negro Year Book, a publication that incorporated his periodic summation of lynching reports, which resulted in the Tuskegee Institute becoming one of the most quoted and undisputed sources on this form of racial violence. According to Work's biographer, these resources were the largest of their kind in an era when scholarship by and about black Americans was highly inaccessible, and overlooked or ignored by most academics in the US. Work received the Harmon Award in Education in 1928 for his research and involvement in the Negro Year Book and his work on A Bibliography of the Negro in Africa and America. In 1918, he was elected to the American Negro Academy, which was the earliest major African American learned society. He died of natural causes in Tuskegee in 1945.

Geography View into the Taurach valley The town is part of the Salzburg Pongau region. It is located in the valley of the Enns River, near the confluence with its Taurach tributary, at the foot of Ro√übrand mountain, part of the Salzburg Slate Alps. In the south the road runs parallel to the Taurach stream up to Untertauern, the Obertauern ski resort and the Radst√§dter Tauern Pass at , which marks the border with the Salzburg Lungau region. In the east, the Ennstal road leads to Schladming in Upper Styria. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of H√∂ggen, L√∂benau, Mandling, Radstadt proper, and Schwemmberg. History In the 4th century before the Common Era the area was settled by Celtic tribes, their Noricum kingdom was incorporated as a Roman province about 15 BC. The road across the Tauern Pass was part of a major Roman road, leading from Aquileia in Italy to the city of Iuvavum (present-day Salzburg) in the north. Styrian Gate and Capuchin Tower A place called Rastat (i.e. \\"resting place\\") was already mentioned in a 1074 deed. The fortress of Radstadt was founded in the 13th century, when the Pongau region became part of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and border conflicts arose with the Habsburg dukes of Styria; it received city rights in 1289. The town served as seat of the local administration and was of significant value for the protection of the Enns Valley and the road crossing the Alpine crest via Radst√§dter Tauern Pass towards Carinthia and Aquileia. Radstadt has a Gothic church consecrated in 1417, and a town hall dating from 16th century. In the German Peasants' War of 1524/25, the citizens sided with Prince-Archbishop Matth√§us Lang von Wellenburg and resisted a siege by a peasants' army of about 5,000 men led by Michael Gaismair. The city walls are preserved, including three towers which the besiegers were forced to erect after their defeat. in 1629 the prince- archbishops established a Capuchin monastery here to spread the Counter- Reformation in the Enns Valley. As in many other Salzburg areas under the rule of Archbishop Leopold Anton von Firmian, the Protestant population was expelled in 1731/32; as Exulanten they were granted asylum by the Prussian king Frederick William I and settled in the Gumbinnen region of East Prussia. Today Radstadt is also a popular tourism resort, with more tourists annually than the year-round population. It features its own ski area, and is part of an extended downhill ski and snowboard region (Ski Amad√©) with links with the neighbouring town of Altenmarkt.

Edwin Livingston (March 17, 1892 - October 15, 1971) was an American jurist and the Twenty-third Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 1951 through 1971. He was born in Notasulga, Alabama. Livingston attended the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University) and the University of Alabama, where he received a law degree in 1918. After graduation, he served in the United States Army for the remainder of World War I. Upon returning home, he set up a law practice in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as well as serving as a professor of law at the University of Alabama from 1922 to 1940.

He was a top military commander in his father Alaungpaya's reunification campaigns of the country. As king, he spent much of his short reign suppressing multiple rebellions across the newly founded kingdom from Ava (Inwa) and Toungoo (Taungoo) to Martaban (Mottama) and Chiang Mai. The king suddenly died less than a year after he had successfully suppressed the rebellions. He was succeeded by his younger brother Hsinbyushin. Early life Naungdawgyi was born Maung Lauk () to Yun San and Aung Zeya (later King Alaungpaya) on 10 August 1736 (Tuesday, 11th waxing of Wagaung 1096 ME) in a small village of Moksobo, about 60 miles northwest of Ava (Inwa).Maung Maung Tin Vol. 1 1905: 263 He was the eldest child of the couple's nine children. In 1736, his father became the chief of Moksobo, and the deputy chief of the Mu valley, their home region. Lauk grew up during the period in which the royal authority of the king at Ava had largely dissipated across the kingdom. He watched helplessly as the Meiteis ransack his home region year after year, and could not understand why the king could not prevent these repeated raids.Myint-U 2006: 88‚Äì91 Their sense of helplessness only deepened in 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma broke away, and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom centered in Pegu (Bago). Throughout his teens, Lauk and his fellow Upper Burmans watched how Pegu was increasingly winning the war against Ava. Heir-apparent and commander By the time Peguan armies captured Ava in March 1752, his father had persuaded the people of Mu valley to join him in his resistance effort, declared himself king with the royal style of Alaungpaya, and founded the Konbaung Dynasty. As the eldest son, Naungdawgyi was appointed the heir apparent although their self-styled \\"kingdom\\" consisted of just 46 villages in the Mu valley. Still just 17, Naungdawgyi fought alongside his father's best commanders against the invading forces of Pegu. Though not as talented as his younger brother Hsinbyushin, two years his junior, Naungdawgyi proved to be a top military commander in his own right, leading armies in the Konbaung military campaigns that defeated the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1757. He stayed behind managing the kingdom on his father's behalf during Alaungpaya's later campaigns: Manipur in 1758 and Siam (1759‚Äì1760). His father died from a sudden illness in the Siamese campaign in May 1760. Succession crisis As the heir-apparent, Naugndawgyi was in line to succeed Alaungpaya who had pronounced that all of his six sons by his first wife would become king in the order of seniority. Yet the succession was not smooth. Throughout Burmese monarchy, succession was usually associated with rebellions by vassal kings and governors, coups, and/or bloody purges. Naungdawgyi's accession was no exception. The first threat to his authority came from his eldest younger brother Hsinbyushin, who sought the army's support for his attempt at the throne. Hsinbyushin did not get the support but Naungdawgyi forgave his brother at the queen mother's intercession.Harvey 1925: 243‚Äì244 Naungdawgyi was crowned on 26 July 1760 at Sagaing, and ascended the Peacock throne at Shwebo on 9 February 1761 with the reign name of Thiri Pawara Maha Dhammayaza (; ). Following Alaungpaya's wishes, Hsinbyushin was made the heir-apparent. Rebellions Naungdawgyi faced multiple rebellions during his short reign: one by Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta (1761), two separate ones by the vassal states of Toungoo (1761‚Äì1762) and Lan Na (1761‚Äì1763). Another vassal state Manipur also came under attack by Manipuri rebels in 1763. Ava Naungdawgyi forgave Hsinbyushin possibly because he was more concerned with a possible insurrection by the army. He had incurred distrust among the army command because he executed two of the generals he disliked as soon as he became king. One of his father's most trusted generals Minkhaung Nawrahta, with whom Naungdawgyi never got along, decided to rebel when he was summoned to see the new king. The general, who commanded deep respect among the troops, and his followers (12,000-strong)James 2004: 734‚Äì735 seized Ava on 25 June 1760.Phayre 1883: 184‚Äì185 It took over five months for Naungdawgyi to retake the city in early December. The general was killed by a musket shot as he fled the city. Naungdawgyi was shaken by this tragedy, and was deeply remorseful at the death of one of his father's brothers-in-arms.Htin Aung 1967: 172‚Äì173Harvey 1925: 246‚Äì247 Toungoo But worse was yet to come. In the following year, two vassal states, Toungoo and Lan Na, revolted. Manipur, another vassal state, came under attack by rebels. The leader of the Toungoo rebellion was none other than Naungdawgyi's uncle, Thado Theinkhathu, who along with a few senior army commanders had decided to challenge his nephew. The Toungoo rebellion was largely a protest at the treatment given to Minkhaung Nawrahta. Naungdawgyi with his army now marched to Toungoo, and laid siege to the city. (Hsinbyushin provided no help to his brother.) It was not until January 1762 that the city surrendered. Weary over the developments, Naungdawgyi pardoned his uncle and the commanders. (Among the pardoned officers included the likes of Balamindin who would go on to lead the army in future wars.Kyaw Thet 1962: 296‚Äì298) Lan Na and Martaban While Naungdawgyi was laying siege to the Toungoo, the vassal king loyal of Lan Na at Chiang Mai was overthrown. (Southern Lan Na had come back to the fold only in 1757. Prior, the Ping valley of southern Lan Na had been in revolt since 1725.) The leader of the rebellion, Chao Khihut, immediately began defensive preparations,Saratsawadi et al 2005: 126 as well as implementing a preemptive offensive strategy. Khihut allowed Talaban, the top Restored Hanthawaddy general who had been on the run, to use Chiang Mai as his base to raise an army to launch an attack. In late 1761, Talaban and his army entered Martaban (Mottama), and for a time, appeared to distract Naungdawgyi's army at Toungoo. But Talaban's army could not rally greater support among the Mon population in Lower Burma, and was driven back. Talaban fell back to the jungle between the Salween (Thanlwin) and Moei rivers (present-day Mon State and Kayin State), reduced to conducting guerrilla warfare.Phayre 1883: 186 After Toungoo was captured, Naungdawgyi then sent an 8000-strong army to Chiang Mai. The Burmese army captured Chiang Mai in early 1763, and marched right up to the Chinese frontier, demonstrating Burmese control over the entire region. By then, Talaban had also been captured. The army actually caught Talaban's family first. Talaban came out from hiding and offered his life in return for his family. Struck by chivalry, Naungdawgyi released them all, and took Talaban into his service. Manipur By early 1763, Naungdawgyi had suppressed all the rebellions. Unbeknown to him, Manipur was to be the next trouble spot. In April 1763, the Manipuri king who was driven out by Alaungpaya in 1758 tried to invade his former kingdom with an army that also included a small detachment of English East India Company troops. He had received the Company's support in September 1762. But the invading army never made it to Manipur as it got bogged down on their way in Cachar. The English detachment was unprepared to march in terrible terrain.Bareh 2001: 51 Anglo-Burmese relations Fresh off the Negrais affair, the Anglo-Burmese relations remained decidedly frosty. While Naungdawgyi was laying siege to Ava, in September 1760, he received the English East India Company envoy Captain Walter Alves whose mission was to demand reparations for the Burmese sack of the English colony at Negrais in October 1759. The king refused to consider the demand but agreed to release English prisoners. He asked to resume trade as he was in urgent need of munitions.Alves 1760: 8‚Äì9, 14‚Äì16, 20 The English, still amid the Seven Years' War, did not deem the Burma trade profitable enough to resume trade.Hall 1960: Chapter X: Alaungpaya Dynasty, p. 26 Instead, the English entered into an agreement with the fugitive Manipuri king to provide military assistance in exchange for land and trade privileges. On 4 September 1762, the Company signed an agreement to provide a contingent of troops to drive out the Burmese from Manipur. In return, the Manipuri rebels promised to cede in perpetuity a rent-free land at a suitable place in Manipur for the installation of a factory and a fort, and also provide every facility for the promotion of trade with China. The Manipuris not only agreed to pay the expenses of English troops but also promised to compensate for the loss suffered by the English at Negrais.Bareh 2001: 49‚Äì50 While their first attempt to invade Manipur in 1763 had to be abandoned, Sigh's Manipuri resistance remained active with English help. (They would temporarily drive out the Burmese vassal king in 1764 before being driven back out by Hsinbyushin.) Death and succession Naungdawgyi died in November 1763. He was only 29. According to historian Helen James, he died of scrofula, the same illness that inflicted his father and would also take his brother Hsinbyushin. Finally free of rebellions, the king had spent his last few months on works of merit building two pagodas on the Mahananda Lake near Shwebo. He was succeeded by his brother Hsinbyushin.Harvey 1925: 248 He had five sons and two daughters.
