It was filmed during the 1985 riots in Handsworth and London. The production company was the Black Audio Film Collective, who also wrote the screenplay. With cinematography by Sebastian Shah and music by Trevor Mathison, there were voice-overs by Pervais Khan, Meera Syal, Yvonne Weekes, Sachkhand Nanak Dham and Mr. McClean. A full list of cast and credits appears on the BFI Screenonline.Handsworth Songs cast and credits, BFI Screen Online. Background Handsworth Songs was commissioned by Channel 4 for their series Britain: The Lie of the Land and won seven prizes internationally, including the John Grierson Award for Best Documentary (BFI). The production company used their now renowned methods of intermixing newsreel, still photos and a sound mosaic, creating an experimental multi-layered narrative. It gives accounts of those involved in or observing the 1985 riots and more significantly their personal reflections. Viewers create their own interpretation of narrative through navigation of the multi-faceted material presented, which is a direct response to the fragmented presentation of the story of the riots. Ann Ogidi, the author, sees it as a journey as if wandering through an art gallery with images of the 1950s. In 1983 the Black Audio Film Collective came together to encourage a Black film culture within film and video, specifically looking at questions of Black representation, including colonial imagery and anti-racist/sexist film material. Their work includes Signs of Empire (1989), Images of Nationality and Handsworth Songs (1986).Undercut (17): 43, Spring 1988. In an interview with Paul Gilroy and Jim Pines, the Black Audio Film Collective define the specific audience for their films as an imaginary construction, films made for Diasporic peoples, rather than simply Black people. This is almost a marketing strategy to help define where they might be shown. It analyses the limits of definition of an audience.

Bedingfield, Commander of HMS Prometheus and William McCoskry, Acting Consul to Lagos) and Oba Dosunmu of Lagos (spelled 'Docemo' in British documents) representing Lagos. Background In Britain's early 19th century fight against the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade, its West Africa Squadron or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French, and Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from Sierra Leone all the way to the Niger Delta (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo. In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854.Howard Temperley, ‚ÄòBeecroft, John (1790‚Äì1854)‚Äô, rev. Elizabeth Baigent, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Reduction of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye (and the ouster of Oba Kosoko) who signed the Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection to Lagos. The Treaty of Cession Following threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted \\"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on July 30, 1861 aboard HMS Prometheus where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but under the threat to unleash violence on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the treaty.

She had muscular dystrophy. She moved to the California Bay Area in 1972, and began working as a community organizer for the disability rights movement in 1974. Early life Curtis Seldon Cone (Kitty) was born on April 7, 1944 in Champaign, Illinois. Their family moved to Florida once her father returned from World War II. Her father was a lawyer during their time in Florida, but left the firm, joined the army once again, and the family moved to Georgia. As a child, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Once the family was in Georgia, Cone began receiving treatment for her disability, which at that time, was misdiagnosed. A few years later, she moved with her family to Maryland, where she began receiving surgeries at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The surgeries and treatments had a worsening effect on Cone. She moved with her mother back to Champaign during the time that her father was serving with the army in Japan. During her early teen years, Cone had walking casts to stretch out her tendons in her legs, but did not use crutches at the time. Her diagnosis changed around this time from cerebral palsy to polio. After another couple surgeries, she began using a cane to walk. Where Cone attended school, at Hope and Arms school in Washington, D.C., the school buildings were several stories high. Her cousins, who attended there as well, began carrying her up the stairs to attend classes. When Cone was in her mid-teens, her family moved to Kentucky. This was the first time she witnessed overt racism, attributing that to her school's segregation. It was in Kentucky that she got involved with civic activities. Being unhappy in Kentucky, her parents applied to several boarding schools in Washington, D.C. She attended Mount Vernon Seminary. She was successful in academics and very popular, but was expelled after one semester. This had to do with her disability and the liability for the school. The headmistress imposed rules on Cone, like prohibiting her from going to the school field, and ultimately only offered the option of allowing Cone to attend during the day, and not being a boarding student. Due to her disability and her father being in the military, Cone attended a total of thirteen schools. She attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. She began using a wheelchair on campus and had to learn how to do daily activities while using a wheelchair. She was active in cheerleading and Student Senate. While running for Student Senate, she was interviewed by Roger Ebert, who at the time, was editor of The Daily Illini. At the end of her first year of college, her mother passed away suddenly. She had cancer, but Cone did not know about it. It is said her mother was misdiagnosed with what was referred to as nerves. She finished the semester, but returned home after the semester was over to help with her younger brother and stayed home through the fall semester of 1963. Her next year of school she got involved with the NAACP. It was at this time that she was heavily involved with the Civil Rights Movement. She was becoming weaker about her second year of college and appealed to the Dean to move off campus into an apartment of her own, so she might experience living on her own before she was physically unable to do so. She also noted the dormitory curfew imposed on women at the time was hard to make when she was so active in the community. The Dean had her consult with the head of her academic program. The head of her program said something about her getting weaker because of all the protests she participated in and then hinted that she only wanted to live on her own so she could have sexual relationships. During her time on campus, she and other students with disabilities were advised to not ask for or accept help from other students, so as to not appear weak or unfit for employment. Cone left college six hours from her degree. Activism During her time at University of Illinois, Cone organized and participated in activism about the Vietnam war, civil rights, and poverty. In the spring of 1967, Cone moved to New York and continued her Anti-War efforts she started while at the University of Illinois. After short stints in Chicago and Atlanta, Cone moved to Oakland, California in 1974 and connected with the Center for Independent Living. She liked the work they were doing and approached Ed Roberts about working with the Center for Independent Living. Cone had experience in political organizing, so she was hired for the Community Affairs Department. For years, she worked in the Community Affairs Department doing health and welfare lobbying, organizing local, state, and national political efforts, and worked on architectural and transportation barriers to access. It was there that she organized a coalition and began getting ramps and curb cuts installed in Oakland. Cone organized and participated in the 504 Sit-in. Initially Joseph Califano, U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, refused to sign meaningful regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was the first U.S. federal civil rights protection for people with disabilities. After an ultimatum and deadline, demonstrations took place in ten U.S. cities on April 5, 1977, including the beginning of the 504 Sit-in at the San Francisco Office of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. This sit-in, led by Judith Heumann and organized by Cone, lasted until May 4, 1977, a total of 28 days, with more than 150 people refusing to leave. It is the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. Joseph Califano signed the unaltered regulations on April 28, 1977. During the 504 Sit-in, Cone requested her FBI file and found she was on an FBI list. During her time at University of Illinois, she became Marxist. After the Section 504 regulations were signed, Cone focused on transportation. She pursued implementation of Section 504 by protesting at the San Francisco Transbay Terminal in 1978, organizing Disabled People's Civil Rights Day in October 1979 in San Francisco, and lobbying in Washington against the Cleveland Amendment, which would have allowed local agencies to provide paratransit services instead of creating accessible public transportation systems. In 1984 she began working at the World Institute on Disability, where she researched international personal care assistance programs. In 1990 she began working for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF)'s lawyer referral service, and in 1993 she became its development director. She retired in 1999, but remained active with DREDF. Personal life She was openly lesbian, and adopted and raised a son named Jorge from Mexico. She was an alcoholic and stopped drinking in the 1970s. She adopted her son, Jorge, in 1981. Death Kitty Cone died on March 21, 2015 in Berkeley, California.

After six missionary voyages, the schooner was sold in 1900 for commercial use, and renamed Florence S. She was lost by stranding on the island of Mindoro, Philippine Islands, on 17 October 1912. Background The Seventh-day Adventist John Tay, a former sailor, was advised by his doctor to take a sea voyage in 1886. He paid his way by working as a carpenter. At Tahiti he found passage on , a British man-of-war. Tay reached Pitcairn Island on HMS Pelican on 18 October 1886, and stayed until the last week of November. Pitcairn was and still is inhabited by descendants of the mutineers on . The islanders were already familiar with Adventist concepts, as they had received a box of Adventist tracts about ten years earlier. In five weeks Tay converted the whole population to Adventism. He was unable to perform baptisms since he was not ordained, but promised to return with a minister. The Adventists had devoted relatively little effort to foreign missions up to the time of Tay's voyage, despite the urging of Ellen G. White. The news of Tay's success galvanized the church. A resolution was passed at the California Adventist conference in October 1887 to buy a ship for use in missionary work in the Pacific islands. At the General Conference in Oakland that started on 13 November 1887 a committee was established to consider a resolution to use up to $20,000 to buy or build a ship, to be ready early in 1888. The committee recommended postponing the project so funds could be raised and the requirements studied. In April 1888 the committee decided to dispatch Elder Andrew J. Cudney with Tay to Pitcairn and other islands to determine what type of vessel would be needed. Cudney left for Honolulu on 20 May 1888 on Sonomo. When he arrived he arranged to outfit a schooner at a cost of about $900 to the Conference, with the option for the Conference to buy the ship for $1,100 after a trial voyage. Cudney left Honolulu for Tahiti on Phoebe Chapman on 31 July 1888. There he was to join Tay, who had left Oakland for Tahiti on 5 July 1888. The plan was for Cudney and Tay to continue to Pitcairn Island, where Cudney could perform the promised baptisms. Tay reached Tahiti early in August 1888 and waited there for Cudney. After three months he met a man who had seen Phoebe Chapman in Honolulu, and who described how the schooner had been altered and loaded. Tay did not consider the changes and ballast arrangement to be safe, and wrote a letter saying he did not want to sail in the schooner. After six months he gave up waiting for Phoebe Chapman, and on 14 January 1889 sailed on Tahiti for San Francisco. Cudney had vanished without trace. Construction Visitors on board the ship during construction Diagram of the schooner The General Conference of October 1889 resolved to immediately buy or built a suitable vessel for missionary work in the Pacific Islands, to be ready by the end of 1890, with at least $20,000 raised by donations to fund the project. The sum was later changed to be no more than $12,000. It was agreed to devote the world-wide Sabbath School contributions for the first six months to the cost of the ship. On 22 April 1890 Charles H. Jones and John Tay signed a detailed contract with Captain Matthew Turner, who had a shipyard at Benicia, California, to deliver a schooner complete in \\"hull, spars, and iron work\\" by 31 July 1890 at a cost of $7,400, to be paid in installments as the work progressed. Turner agreed to donate $500 of his own money, so the cost was lowered to $6,900. The cost of the schooner when fully rigged was under $12,000, although the final cost of the fully furnished vessel was $18,683.05. Donations of almost $16,000 almost covered the cost, and various publishing houses donated books worth thousands of dollars. Pitcairn, as the schooner was named, had two masts, both about tall. The ship was about long and wide, with a depth of . It had a net register tonnage of 115 tons. There were almost of sails, made in Chicago. Pitcairn was initially rigged as a topsail schooner. The hull was sheathed in copper to protect it from worms, and held fifty tons of slag as ballast. The forecastle had eight berths for a crew of up to twelve seamen. Beside this was the galley, and then the cabin, which held a bookcase and an organ besides the furniture. Six staterooms were provided for up to eighteen passengers. There were two toilet rooms and one bath room. There were two large water tanks in the aft of the vessel, which was otherwise left empty for cargo. The ship was launched into San Francisco Bay on schedule on 28 July 1890 and work started on rigging and outfitting. The ship was dedicated on the afternoon of 25 September 1890 in a lengthy ceremony attended by about 1,500 people. A number of short trips were made in the bay before the start of the first voyage, generally carrying Sabbath School members as passengers. The white-hulled Pitcairn was described as a fine specimen of American shipbuilding, a shapely wooden craft. At Pitcairns dedication M. C. Wilcox said the ship was \\"made of the very best timber\\" with workmanship of \\"the best character.\\" One of her later captains said \\"She was a smart vessel and could sail like the devil.\\" Missionary voyages Pitcairn made a total of six voyages in the South Pacific in the 1890s, carrying missionaries to the Society Islands, Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji. On each of Pitcairns voyages the vessel sailed from San Francisco to Pitcairn Island before going on to other islands. Some of the islanders became interested in missionary work, and asked to accompany missionaries assigned to other islands. Some of the islanders were brought to San Francisco for formal training at Healdsburg College. =First voyage= Elder and Mrs. Edward Gates (left), Elder and Mrs. Albert Read (right), Mr. and Mrs. John Tay (standing) On its first voyage Pitcairn sailed from San Francisco on 20 October 1890 under captain Joseph Marsh. The crew included a first mate, three sailors, a cook and a cabin boy. She carried three missionary couples from San Francisco, John and Hannah Tay, Edward H. and Ida Gates, and Albert and Hattie Read. She reached Pitcairn Island on 25 November 1890. On 26 November 1890 the British ship Troop, traveling from Oregon to Cardiff, communicated with Pitcairn and was then boarded by Tay and about 20 islanders, who sold the captain fruit and vegetables. On 28 November 1890 the iron sailing ship Renee Rickmers of Bremerhaven was approaching Pitcairn Island when she saw the schooner, mistook it for a pirate, and rapidly stood out to sea to escape. During the schooner's three-week stay, 82 Pitcairn islanders were baptized. After this Pitcairn sailed onward to other Pacific Islands. She carried three Pitcairn islanders as missionary helpers: James Russell McCoy, his sister Mary McCoy and Heywood Christian. She then continued through the Society Islands and Hervey Islands, stopping at several ports. She sailed on to Samoa, where she spent a week in Apia Harbour, then sailed via Tonga to the Fiji islands, where she called at various places. The Tays were left to conduct missionary work at Suva, Fiji. He died there after a few months. She left Suva on 21 September 1891 and sailed for Norfolk Island, which she reached on 30 September 1891. The Pitcairn Adventists reunited with their relatives on Norfolk and working with missionaries on board, soon established the Adventist Church on Norfolk.https://heritage.adventistconnect.org/uploaded_assets/427644-Church_in_a_Convict_Goal.pdf?thumbnail=original&1431991661 The Reads, as well as Captain Marsh's wife, remained at Norfolk Island when the ship sailed on 7 October 1891 for Auckland, New Zealand. The New Zealand Herald reported the arrival of the mission schooner Pitcairn at WaitematƒÅ Harbour on 12 October 1891. Pitcairn sailed from Auckland back to Norfolk, battling head winds and high seas, then returned to Auckland where she was refitted as a brigantine. A new cabin, forecastle and galley were built above deck, since the below-deck conditions in the tropics were stifling, and an auxiliary engine was installed for use in ports. The refitted ship again left Auckland on 26 June 1892 and made a very difficult 37-day passage to Pitcairn. She finally reached San Francisco via Tahiti on 8 October 1892. =Second voyage= Before her second voyage various improvements were made, including enlargement of the deck cabin. On the second voyage J. Christensen, the former first mate who had become captain on the previous voyage after the death of Captain Marsh, again commanded the ship. Passengers included the missionaries Benjamin and Iva Cady, John and Fanny Cole, and Elliot and Cora Chapman. Others were the medical doctor Merritt Kellogg, the teacher Miss Hattie Andre, and James McCoy. The ship sailed from San Francisco on 17 January 1893 and reached Pitcairn on 19 February 1893. She went on to Tahiti, Huahine and Raiatea Islands, where Benjamin Cady and the Chapmans chose to stay to work as missionaries and teachers. The ship stopped at Rurutu Island, Mangaia Island, Rarotonga and Niue Island. At all of these Kellogg treated many sick people. She bypassed Vava'u Island, Tonga, where there was a measles epidemic, to avoid being quarantined. She sailed via Fiji and Norfolk Island, where the Coles remained, to New Zealand. Pitcairn then sailed for Pitcairn Island, arriving on 6 February 1894 to find that the people had been ravaged by a typhoid epidemic. The ship reached San Francisco on 30 March 1894. =Third voyage= On the third voyage Pitcairn was captained by the Pastor John Graham. It carried Dr. Joseph Caldwell, his wife Julia and their two boys. Caldwell planned to practice medicine on Raiatea. Other missionaries were George and Ada Wellman, Rodney and Carrie Stringer, W. E. and Rosa Buckner, Dudley and Sarah Owen with their two children, and Miss Lillian White. The ship sailed on 17 June 1894 and reached Pitcairn after a rough voyage of thirty days. The crew and passengers had difficulty landing in the rough seas. Pitcairn sailed on with the islanders Maude and Sarah Young as missionaries, who received some basic medical training. At Papeete, Tahiti the governor proved hostile and told Pitcairn not to visit Raiatea. The Wellmans and Lillian White remained at Papeete. The ship went on to Huahine Island, where the missionaries received a mixed reception, then to Rurutu Island, where the Stringers and Sarah Young were allowed to stay. The Owen and Caldwell families left the ship at Rarotonga, with Maud Young as an assistant to Caldwell. On return to Papeete they received grudging permission for a brief visit to Raiatea, from where they sailed back to San Francisco, arriving on 27 December 1894. =Fourth voyage= Edwin Butz with his wife Florence The fourth voyage left San Francisco on 1 May 1895, commanded again by John Graham, Passengers were Dr. Frederick Braucht and his wife Mina, Edwin Butz with his wife Florence Butz and daughter Alma, Edward and Ida Hilliard and their daughter Alta, Jesse and Cora Rice and child, and Rowen and Pauline Prickett. They reached Pitcairn after 36 days. The Butz family remained temporarily in Pitcairn. In Tahiti Pitcairn picked up the Wellmans and Lillian White, destined for Rarotonga, and the Chapmans, who were returning to the US. The Pricketts remained in Tahiti. From Papeete the ship touched at Raiatea, Rurutu and Rimatara Island en route to Rarotonga, where the Rice and Wellman families and Lillian White left the ship. Edward Hilliard with his wife Ida Hilliard and their two-year-old daughter Alta disembarked at Tongatapu, the main island of Tonga, on 30 August 1895. They were the first resident missionaries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church of Tonga. They lived in temporary quarters while Edward Hilliard built a four-room cottage. Around November 1895 Ida Hilliard began to teach school, first in their temporary home and then in their cottage. The Pitcairn went on to Fiji, then to Apia, Samoa, and in late October 1895 sailed from there to San Francisco which was reached in early December 1895. =Fifth voyage= Missionaries ready to sail on Pitcairns fifth voyage (18 May 1896) The fifth voyage left San Francisco on 19 May 1896 under John Graham. Passengers were Herbert and Millie Dexter, Joseph and Cleora Green, Jonathan and Sophie Whatley with their son, the nurse William Floding and the Pitcairn islanders Alfred and Arthur Young. The Whatleys stayed at Pitcairn. The Butz family boarded, having been transferred to Tonga, with the Pitcairners Maria Young and Tom Christian as assistants. James McCoy and the author Rosalind Amelia Young also joined the ship. Stops included Papeete, Rurutu, Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Palmerston atoll and Samoa. The ship reached Tongatapu on 29 August 1986. Here Edwin Butz and his wife Florence disembarked. They were accompanied by two Pitcairn Islanders, Sarah and Maria Young, descendants of Bounty mutineer, midshipman Ned Young. In 1897 Dr. Merritt Kellogg and Eleanor Kellogg joined them. Pitcairn went on the Fiji, then on the return voyage visited Vanuatu, the eastern Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands, where they were warned off by the German authorities. She returned to San Francisco late in 1896, where she remained for over two years due to lack of funding. =Sixth and last voyage= J. Werge captained Pitcairn on its final voyage, leaving San Francisco on 23 January 1899. It did not carry any new missionaries, but did carry Edward Gates, who was in charge of missionary work on the islands and was to assess the status and needs at each island group. The vessel carried lumber for construction at the missions. The ship sailed first to Pitcairn, where it stayed for three weeks, then went on to Papeete. Raiiatea and Rarotonga, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. Pitcairn reached Tongatapu on 3 June 1899, bringing a small prefabricated building that was used at first as a mission home and as a chapel. After 18 months it was taken apart and rebuilt as the small Nuku'alofa church, . Pitcairn transferred the Butz family north to Vava ªu Island, then sailed for Fiji on 13 June 1899. After leaving a printing press there, the ship returned to San Francisco. Commercial career In 1900 the American Foreign Mission Board agreed that the Pacific Islands should be administered from Australia. They sold Pitcairn to W.E. Nesbitt for $6,500 soon after returning to San Francisco from its sixth voyage. She was renamed Florence S. (Another account says she was bought by the Arnold firm of San Francisco.) On 6 March 1900 she made a voyage to Cape Nome, Alaska. Towards the end of 1900 she sailed from San Francisco for a 3-month cruise off Mexico. The ship was sold to Clark and Spencer of Manila in the Philippines, and on 22 February 1901 Florence S left for Manila under Captain Blain with a cargo of flour. She was lost when she was stranded on Mindoro on 17 October 1912. None of the eight people on board were lost. Depictions Pitcairn was depicted in a 1968 definitive Norfolk Island postage stamp.http://stampinformation.blogspot.com/2010/05/norfolk- island-1967-ships-complete-set.html?m=1 References Sources     * Category:Schooners Category:Brigantines Category:History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church Category:19th century in the Pitcairn Islands Category:1890 ships Category:Ships built in Benicia, California Category:Missing ships ","title":"Pitcairn (schooner)"},{"id":"45220550","text":"Jemima & Johnny (1966) is a British/South African dramatic short film set in London.

Schlobin, Andre Norton, A Primary and Secondary Bibliography, NESFA Press (Framingham, MA), 1994, 2nd Printing (1998), , Pg 5 This is the sequel to The Stars Are Ours! and continues that adventure three generations on. Background In The Stars Are Ours! a group of four dozen scientists and engineers rebuilds an interplanetary spaceship for an interstellar journey to escape from a vile anti-intellectual dictatorship. Traveling at sub-light speed, with its crew and passengers in suspended animation, the ship coasts for centuries, finally reaching a star with an Earth-like planet, Astra, on which the ship lands. On that alien world the humans befriended sentient humanoids, the amphibious merpeople, who appear to have evolved from creatures similar to otters. The new colonists also discover the ruins of cities once occupied by Those Others, a different species of people that the merpeople fear. Plot Dalgard Nordis, with his knife brother Sssuri, has gone on his man-journey. Three generations after his people came to Astra he has set out to explore the ruins of a city that once belonged to Those Others, thereby extending the Colony's map of this world and in the process demonstrating his suitability to sit on the Council of Free Men. In telepathic contact with the local fauna, Sssuri senses danger and the sight of a flaming object crossing the sky from east to west, toward where Those Others are rumored to live, underscores that judgement. Roughly five centuries after a group of renegade scientists took a desperate plunge into interstellar space and two centuries after Pax collapsed and Humanity rediscovered the value of science, the starship RS 10 lands on Astra. Driven by rumors of that ancient expedition and enabled by the discovery of hyperdrive, the Federation of Free Men has sent nine ships into hyperspace; none has returned. On this tenth attempt at interstellar flight Raf Kurbi has the task of assembling and flying the flitter that will be used to explore the part of Astra around RS 10's landing point. One goal is what appears on the landing photos to be a city. Dalgard and Sssuri come to a ruined seaport on a great bay and follow a road inland to a city. There they find evidence that Those Others have visited recently. They also find the trail of a snake-devil, a vicious dragon-like creatures that humans and merfolk always hunt down and kill. They follow the trail and kill a family of snake-devils only to find the creatures wearing metal bands that indicate the recent presence of the unknown enemy. They resolve to send a message by telepathic relay south to Homeport. Raf and three other men ride the RS 10's flitter south over an abandoned landscape and arrive at a ruined city. Near the center of the city they meet the remnant of a devastated population. The aliens are preparing a final expedition to a faraway city to retrieve knowledge that may help them regain their civilization and the captain of the Terrans accepts their invitation to join it. The expedition takes the aliens, in their globe-ship, and the Terrans, in their flitter, to an abandoned city, where the aliens loot a storehouse. With Sssuri heading south to warn his people and the humans at Homeport, Dalgard returns to the forbidden city to spy. As Raf watches from hiding, the aliens capture Dalgard and take him to their globe-ship. Returning to their city across the sea, the aliens put Dalgard into an arena with a merman and a snake-devil. Raf rescues Dalgard and the merman and the three go into the sewers under the city, where they meet a merman war party. Re-entering the city with the war party, Raf uses two grenades to destroy the globe-ship and its cargo, but is burned in the process. With the aid of the mermen, Dalgard takes Raf to a point on the coast where he and the mermen can send a telepathic call to one of the RS 10's crew. With Raf safely returned to his ship, Dalgard faces the daunting prospect of returning to Homeport by himself.

At the beginning of the series, she is recruited to work for Olivia Pope in the Washington, D.C.-based crisis management-firm, Olivia Pope & Associates (OPA), that specializes in \\"fixing\\" political situations and scandals. Background She lived in California under the name Lindsay Dwyer, with her mom and dad, Ray Dwyer, where she graduated from Stanford Law School. Her boyfriend, Jesse Tyler, was a computer programmer for the company Cytron. Lindsay received a text-message which she believed was from a colleague at Jesse's work who wanted to contact him. Lindsay broke up with Jesse just before he and six other co-workers at Cytron were killed in an explosion which Lindsay was framed for. She was drugged, kidnapped and taken to Washington D.C. where she was given a new identity as Quinn Perkins. She joined a law firm in D.C. called O'Malley & Lee under her assumed identity. She was then called in to an interview by Harrison Wright to which she was hired to work at Olivia Pope & Associates. Storylines =Season 1= Quinn gets a job at Olivia Pope & Associates after an interview with Harrison Wright, who she believed was a blind date. She is tasked by Olivia to watch Amanda Tanner at the hospital after Amanda tries to commit suicide. As Olivia hires Amanda as her client, Quinn is the only one in the office allowed to help her with the case. She begins to form a relationship with a news-reporter Gideon Wallace after trying to find out what he knows about Amanda Tanner. Quinn begins to learn how the law-firm works and forms a friendship with Huck, the tech guy at the firm. Quinn and Gideon's relationship begins to evolve and they agree to be together as long as Gideon doesn't ask questions about Amanda Tanner. When Gideon figures out the truth about Amanda and President Grant's alleged affair, he confronts Billy Chambers, who is revealed to have slept with Amanda. Chambers attacks Gideon and stabs him in the neck with scissors, ultimately killing him. When Quinn discovers the body, she calls Olivia, who decides to clean up the crime scene. Later, when Quinn is taken to the police station, David Rosen runs her fingerprints and discovers her past life as Lindsay Dwyer. He then confronts Olivia about going to the police to reveal Quinn's real identity. =Season 2= After spending six months in jail awaiting trial, Quinn is prosecuted in federal court for the Cytron explosion, which led to the deaths of her ex-boyfriend Jesse Tyler and six other co- workers. People have begun calling her \\"The Molotov Mistress\\". David Rosen is the prosecutor of the case and asks for the death penalty. However, Olivia contacts Supreme Court Justice Verna Thornton, who managed to get the judge to agree upon a judgment of acquittal and Quinn goes free. After getting released from jail, Quinn struggles to earn respect from her co-workers, as they treat her differently due to the fact she lied to them about her past life. =Season 3= After torturing Billy Chambers, Huck begins to distance himself from her. When on a case for Congresswoman Josie Marcus, Quinn buys herself a gun and begins to practice at the shooting range with a little help from Charlie. Wanting to get adrenaline, Quinn joins Charlie on one of his B613-assignments where she is tricked by Charlie into killing a security guard who was an important part of an investigation being conducted by Olivia and the team. Charlie uses this to blackmail her into joining B613. While searching through security footage Huck finds out that Quinn was responsible for the security guard's death and starts to torture her by pulling out her teeth for betraying Olivia. When she comes back to the office, she learns that Huck doesn't regret his actions, which leads her to leave Pope & Associates. Quinn and Charlie's relationship begins to evolve as they are hired by Cyrus to help clean up the crime scene where Daniel Douglas was murdered. Olivia tries to convince Quinn to come back to the firm, but Quinn refuses. Jake, now the new Command of B613, is hesitated to let Quinn work at the organization. Huck begins to visit her to try and convince her to come back, but Quinn refuses. She expresses her anger towards Huck for torturing her, and they end up kissing. Charlie begins to be concerned about Huck's behavior towards Quinn. She must confront her former colleagues when she and Charlie are called into Pope & Associates by Jake to help Olivia and her team to find Maya Pope. Quinn is caught in the middle when Huck and Charlie disagree on the way of locating Dominic Bell. Quinn and Huck end up kissing and having sex at the parking garage outside Pope & Associates, which leads Maya to walk past them and stab Rowan. Abby and Harrison catch them having sex at the office, which shocks them. After Quinn broke up with Charlie, he gives her an envelope which contains information about Huck's former family. When she tries to give Huck the information, he becomes furious at her and terminates their relationship. =Season 4= Quinn continues to run OPA after Olivia leaves with Jake, and tries to track her down. She has also kept in touch with Abby and Huck everyday in the two months Olivia was gone. Quinn finally manages to track Olivia down and sends her an envelope with information about Harrison's death. This prompts Olivia to return to Washington D.C. Quinn struggles with Huck as he is angry with her for finding out about his family and his feelings towards her. Jake asks Quinn for help in his investigation concerning Jerry and Harrison's death. Jake asks her to talk to Charlie and she agrees. Catherine Winslow, a former colleague of Olivia and Abby, asks OPA for help and Quinn begins to investigate the case as Catherine's daughter is killed. Quinn confronts Catherine's husband, but he shoots himself right in front of Quinn. Quinn then finds an envelope containing pictures of Olivia which she discusses with Huck. At a stakeout spying on Kubiak, Quinn follows him to where Huck is spying on Elizabeth North. She discover that Kubiak, Elizabeth and Vice President Andrew Nichols are working together. She later figures out that the goal is to start a war between the U.S. and West-Angola by kidnapping Olivia and force Fitz to declare a war. When Olivia is kidnapped, Quinn, Huck and Jake team up to find her. They figure out her location in Pennsylvania, but the kidnappers had already left before they arrive. They try to bid on the auction of Olivia on the black market, but lose. Quinn becomes terrified when Huck starts talking about what the buyers will do to Olivia to make Fitz obey. She confronts him about it, admitting that she needs him to make herself feel okay. Relationships =Huck= Huck is the first person Quinn begins to form a friendship with at Olivia Pope & Associates. Throughout the first season Huck helps her around the firm. After her release from jail for the Cytron-explosion, Huck isn't angry at her, unlike the rest of the people at Pope & Associates. However, Quinn begins to become suspicious about her kidnapping and starts to suspect Huck for being the one who drugged her. She also attends several AA-meetings where Huck talks about his addiction to whiskey. However, Quinn realizes that he is actually talking about his addiction to torturing people and he merely passes it off as \\"drinking whiskey\\". Quinn becomes suspicious of Becky, Huck's new girlfriend, who he'd met at an AA-meeting, and tries to warn Huck about her. She starts to find information regarding her own kidnapping and she asks Huck questions about how to kidnap someone. She later accuses him for kidnapping her, which later turns out to be true, at the orders of Olivia. When they discover that Hollis Doyle hired Becky to kill Quinn's former boyfriend Jesse, Quinn tries to hire Huck to kill him. Huck agrees, but only if she leaves after he has completed the request, but Quinn ends up deciding to call off the murder of Hollis Doyle. Huck begins to teach Quinn his methods, trying to make her his prot√©g√©. He teaches her how to be a spy and investigate. Quinn learns quickly. When Huck is captured by Charlie and put in a box, Quinn manages to rescue him. Afterwards, Huck suffers from PTSD and she tells him that he helped her move forward with her life. At the end of the second season, Quinn takes over for Huck in the torturing Billy Chambers when Huck freezes, which affects their friendship. Huck starts to shut Quinn out after she tortured Billy Chambers and he realizes how much she has changed. Quinn starts to hang out with Charlie, much to Huck's displeasure. When Huck finds out that Quinn killed a security guard, who was crucial for the firm's investigation, he tries to punish her by pulling out her teeth. When she comes back to the office, Huck says he doesn't regret his actions of torturing her, which makes Quinn leave OPA and join B613. Huck tries multiple times to get her back to Pope & Associates, but Quinn refuses, still feeling betrayed by Huck. When she and Charlie join Jake at the office for trying to help finding Maya Pope, Quinn and Huck becomes romantically involved. After she breaks up with Charlie, she is given an envelope containing information about Huck's former family which she tries to give to Huck, but he becomes furious with her. Huck later forgives her and they remain friends Notes Category:Drama television characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional characters from Washington, D.C.

The paper was committed to covering \\"wholesome and authentic news\\", and adopted a middle-class, conservative tone. Politically, it was aligned with the Republican Party. After sharing quarters with the Hygienic Company in the 1920s, the Bee moved into the new Chicago Bee Building , an Art Deco structure built between 1929 and 1931. However, after Overton's bank failed in the 1930s, the two businesses shared quarters once again, as the Hygienic Company moved into the Bee building. Chandler Owen became editor of the Bee after moving to Chicago. The Bee initially supported the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which Owen supported, but later joined other publications including the Chicago Defender in opposing the union. Subsequent editors of the paper included Ida B. Wells and Olive Diggs. The Bee's editorial staff was mostly female, and the newspaper covered the black women's club movement extensively. It distinguished itself from other newspapers in the Chicago black press in its promotion of black history and literature. The Bee sponsored the original \\"Mayor of Bronzeville\\" contest which led to the use of the term \\"Bronzeville\\" for the neighborhood. The concept was originally suggested by theater editor James Gentry, who coined the term and had been sponsoring a beauty contest in the neighborhood since 1916. When Gentry left the paper in 1932, he took his concept with him to the Chicago Defender, which continued the contests. The paper's founder and owner Anthony Overton was a wealthy industrialist, owning a number of concerns including the Overton Hygienic Company, a successful cosmetics firm. He had also made a previous venture in publishing, in the form of the Half Century Magazine. After Overton's death in 1946, the Bee was briefly continued by his sons in a tabloid format, but was unsuccessful. It folded in 1947. Very little of the Bee survives today, apart from the building it occupied. One historian was unable to find a single intact issue from the years 1925 to 1935.

However, the 1948 Radcliffe Report 'create[d] a more favourable climate for potential film production by recommending that the Institute should focus its activities exclusively on the promotion of film as an art form'. As part of the plans for the Festival of Britain in 1951, the BFI was allocated funding to produce a cinematic side of the festival, using ¬£10,000 to commission several short experimental films \\"to be shown in the Telecinema, a temporary four-hundred seater cinema on the South Bank\\". After the closure of the Crown Film Unit, there was no remaining state film funding body in the UK. When a new scheme, the Eady Levy, was introduced in December 1951, providing two grants of ¬£12,500 to make experimental films for the Telecinema, the BFI invited producer Michael Balcon to chair the selection committee, and the Experimental Film Fund was created. It received no further funding from the BFI, and offered scant support despite its ambitions. \\"The first projects considered were in the fields of stereoscopic technology and art documentaries.\\" But this changed through the emergence of the Free Cinema movement, which included a number of young filmmakers - Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz, Tony Richardson, and Walter Lassally who were prominent contributors to the BFI's magazine Sight & Sound. The Experimental Film Fund supported Free Cinema films such as Reisz and Richardson's Momma Don't Allow, Lorenza Mazetti's Together (1956), and Lloyd Reckord's Ten Bob in Winter (1963), the first British film by a black filmmaker. Christophe Dupin notes that, despite only having ¬£30,000 in funding for its decade of existence, the film fund had a wide impact: > a fair proportion [of its productions] won major prizes in film festivals > around the world and received positive reviews in the national press... Of > the fifty or so filmmakers supported, at least 32 went on to work in a > variety of jobs in the British (and occasionally overseas) film and > television industries‚Ä¶ The fact that the Fund also gave their first chance > to seven women filmmakers at a time when creative jobs within the film and > TV industries were the almost exclusive property of men was no small > achievement either. 1964-71: Foundation and expansion of the Production Board Jennie Lee became Britain's first ever arts minister in 1964, as part of Harold Wilson's newly elected Labour government. She increased the BFI's government grant-in- aid, and \\"insisted that port of it should go to experimental film production and young filmmakers\\". Increased funding enabled the BFI to professionalise its approach to funding from 1966, under its first production officer Bruce Beresford, and grant-winning filmmakers 'were also given access to technical facilities at the BFI Production Board's offices near Waterloo'. The Board's first production, Herostratus (film), had begun under the Experimental Film Fund, and its production was delayed by the transition to the Production Board, and by the inexperience of the production team. Its second featurette Loving Memory (1970) followed on from its director Tony Scott's opportunity to direct a short, One of the Missing. Beresford's successor Mamoun Hassan commissioned a featurette from London Film School graduate Bill Douglas. My Childhood (1971) won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, a success that secured the reputation and future of the Board. 1972-1981: Feature Film and Experimental Cinema In 1972, the Board's funding was increased significantly to ¬£75,000, and producer Michael Relph took over from Michael Balcon as board chair. Under Hassan and Relph, the Board produced two further films by Douglas, My Ain Folk (1974) and My Way Home (1978), as well as features such as Winstanley, by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo and A Private Enterprise (1974) by Peter K. Smith (the first Asian feature film produced in Britain), but it also provided funding for the London Filmmakers' Co-op, and experimental filmmakers such as Stephen Dwoskin, William Raban, Peter Gidal and Gill Etherley. In 1974, Barrie Gavin took over from Hassan as Head of Production, but resigned fourteen months later. \\"Yet his short tenure remains one of the most audacious periods in the Board's history\\", with the production of 12 political documentaries by far-left and feminist film collectives such as the Berwick Street Collective. He selected few fiction features for production, the most notable being Horace Ov√©'s Pressure, the first black feature film produced in the UK. After Gavin's resignation and the appointment of Peter Sainsbury as Head of Production, the Board faced a number of crises: the first concerned Sainsbury's call of a set of explicit selection criteria, which \\"were frequently the subject of fierce controversy among independent filmmakers\\"; the second concerned censorship, after the BFI caved to police demands not to screen Nick Broomfield and Joan Churchill's documentary Juvenile Liaison (1975), the first full-length documentary funded by the Board; the third concerned the lack of distribution for the Board's films, including Pressure, due to economic constraints. Sainsbury made improving this a priority, and \\"between 1977 and 1979, a dozen new BFI films has a London theatrical release‚Ä¶ six of them being bought by the BBC for television transmission\\". Budgets remained low, and in 1979, \\"the Production Board [had] to strike an agreement with the ACTT (the film technicians' union) to allow crews to be paid below agreed minimum rates in exchange for a share in the profits\\". Chris Petit's debut film Radio On (1979), Peter Greenaway's A Walk Through H (1978), the Quay Brothers' Nocturna Arificialia (1979), Sue Clayton's The Song of the Shirt (1979), Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen's Riddles of the Sphinx (1979), and Menelik Shabazz's Burning an Illusion (1981) represented the diversity and innovation of Sainsbury's commissioning: they included and challenged both fiction and documentary, and combined social politics with experimental aesthetics. According to Sue Harper, the Board > backed projects which seemed too avant-garde for mainstream financiers‚Ä¶ The > aims of the BFI were laudable, and certainly films were funded which would > otherwise have had no chance of reaching the screen, but the Production > Board had a penchant for films with an academic flavour, which displayed > their credentials with a degree of martyrdom. In 1982, ACTT suspended their agreement with the Board, leading to the ACTT Workshop Declaration, which created a Board-funded Regional Production Fund, with monies going to the Sheffield Filmmakers' Co-op, the Leeds Animation Workshop, the Liverpool Black Media Group and the Birmingham Black Film Group. 1982‚Äì91: Partnership with Channel 4 and the \\"Golden Age\\" According to the BFI's Screenonline, > 1982 saw a major breakthrough when Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract > became a modest but genuine commercial success. More significantly, it was > also the first co-production between the BFI and the newly established > Channel 4, which gave the BFI a regular television platform and > correspondingly greater exposure for its work. Behind the scenes, C4 also > became a significant contributor to Production Board funds in general as > well as specific individual works. Other films that benefited from the > collaboration included The Gold Diggers (Sally Potter, 1983), Nineteen > Nineteen (Hugh Brody, 1985) and Ascendancy (Edward Bennett, 1983), the last > of which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. Subsequent international successes for British art house included a Silver Bear at Berlin for Derek Jarman's Caravaggio and the International Film Critics' Prize for Terence Davies' Distant Voices, Still Lives at the Cannes Film Festival. Alan Burton and Steven Chibnall refer to this period as the Board's \\"golden age\\". As well as providing funding for an expansive and internationally-successful British art house, the Board continued in its remit to fund first-time filmmakers and filmmakers from under-represented communities. The New Directors scheme, initiated in 1986, led to funding for a remarkable range of films, including Gurinder Chadha's I'm British But... (1989), Isaac Julien's Young Soul Rebels (1991), and Margaret Tait's Blue Black Permanent (1992). 1992-2000: National Lottery funding and the end of the Production Board There was continuity across the change of funding that occurred in 1992 (to the Department of Heritage, and subsequently the National Lottery Fund), with filmmakers such as Patrick Keiller and Shane Meadows following earlier New Directors shorts with first features. The Board also produced features such as Sixth Happiness (Waris Hussein, 1997), Under the Skin (Carine Adler, 1997), Speak Like A Child (John Akomfrah, 1998), and Jasmin Dizdar's Beautiful People (1999), which won Best Film in Un Certain Regard at Cannes. This win was followed by an announcement at the same festival by culture minister Chris Smith, amalgamating all British film funding agencies into the UK Film Council from the following year.

She was able to translate hand-woven patterns for mechanized production, and pioneered the use of synthetic fibers.\\"Marianne Strengell\\". Knoll. Retrieved December 12, 2014. Early life Strengell was born in Helsinki, Finland, daughter of Finnish architect Gustaf Strengell and interior designer Anna Wegelius. She graduated from the Central School of Industrial Design in Helsingfors in 1929, then went to Stockholm where she assisted in the preparations for the 1930 Stockholm Exhibition. Strengell held several positions in Scandinavia, designing rugs, textiles and interiors. One of her earliest positions was as a designer at Hemflit-Kotiahkeruus where her mother, Anna, was director and responsible for starting a cottage industry in weaving for the farmers' wives. Strengell left Scandinavia for the United States in 1936.\\"Marianne Strengell Papers\\". Cranbrook Archives. Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Retrieved January 26, 2014. Career In 1931 Strengell was invited by family friend Eliel Saarinen to work at the Cranbrook Academy of Art; she began teaching there in 1937. In 1942, when Loja Saarinen retired, Strengell replaced her as head of the Department of Weaving and Textile Design. Soon after, a powerloom was installed in the weaving studios. She developed a curriculum that emphasized weave structure, versus the more pictorial imagery used by Saarinen. In her 25 years at Cranbrook, she trained many textile artists, including Jack Lenor Larsen, Robert Sailors and Ed Rossbach. Her circle of friends and colleagues included Harry Bertoia, Ben Baldwin, Ray and Charles Eames, Florence Knoll, and Eszter Haraszty. She maintained her role as Department Head of Weaving and Textile Design until she retired from Cranbrook in 1961.\\"Marianne Strengell Papers\\". Cranbrook Archives. Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Retrieved January 26, 2014.\\"Marianne Strengell\\". Knoll. Retrieved December 12, 2014. While teaching at Cranbrook, Strengell held a number of outside consulting positions, and worked on commissions for architects, such as the interior fabrics for Eero Saarinen's General Motors Tech Center and work for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Her emphasis on texture rather than pattern influenced the American market in automotive and interior design. Her versatility in the development of new yarns and fabrics contributed toward the use of textiles as architectural elements. Strengell created original textile designs for automotive interiors for Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, Chrysler and American Motors, as well as for United Airlines. Her upholstery design \\"Taj Mahal\\" for the 1959 Lincoln Continental is iconic. She sometimes worked in conjunction with her husband, architect Olav Hammarstr√∂m, designing interiors and textiles for his projects. Most notably, they built and designed together the Vera and Laszlo Tisza House for professors Vera and Laszlo Tisza located in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, purchased four of the five original lots that comprised the Tisza property between August 1954 and September 1956 (Barnstable County Registry of Deeds 1954a, 1954b, 1955, 1956), and completed construction in 1960.

In 1951, Strengell was sent by the International Cooperation Administration to Japan and the Philippines as a weaving and textile adviser to help establish cottage industries. Simultaneously she acted as a consultant there on weaving and textile production, for the U.N. Technical Assistance Administration. With her husband she developed a new loom to accommodate wider widths of fabric, and she incorporated native fibers, such as coconut and grass, into the textiles. Her efforts helped raise the standard of living in both countries. Strengell and Hammarstrom traveled the world, working, lecturing, and studying developments in architecture, arts and crafts, and the use of indigenous materials.\\"Marianne Strengell Papers\\".

Baudin was active in the field of graphic design in many ways and described himself as a ‚Äútypographiste‚Äù. He was part of national and international typographic organisations, like ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale), the Graphica-Belgica Prize, and Rencontres internationales de Lure. Throughout his career he focused on the importance of (hand)writing in graphic design. He wrote and designed two books: How Typography Works (And why it is important) and L'Effet Gutenberg, that summarize his ideas on writing and designing. After his death, because of his influence in the history of design, the Prize for the Most Beautiful Books in Brussels and Wallonia was named after him, called the Fernand Baudin Prize. Education Since his early youth, Baudin already expressed an interest for art and literature, despite of his father's disproval. He consumed book after book, did research about the various typefaces and learned how they were printed. He sent his first drawing to the Verviers daily Le Jour: the sketch of a prominent citizen. In 1936 the family moved from Ghent to Brussels, where they agreed that Fernand could follow night classes at the Academy for fine Arts in Elsene and by day would work as an apprentice with the printing house Tilbury. He extended his education at La Cambre, The National High School for Decorative Arts in Brussels, with the course of book decoration, that he later changed to typography. One of his teachers at the Academy for fine Arts in Elsene, Maurice Gaspar, showed him the special issue of Arts & m√©tiers graphiques, that influenced his change to the typography course. His first efforts as a printer were done with typefaces from the school. Which had type specimens such like Futura and Garamont. It had body type in sizes from 8 to 18, which back then was quite exceptional in Belgium. Eight of his works that he made at La Cambre survived. Fernand Baudin was very well-read. His library shows a great amount of high end literature, that gives a glimpse at his education and ideas. With the change to typography in his third year, he continued his education as a book designer in private study that consisted mainly of professional literature in several languages. His collection included books by and about Marcus Aurelius and Stanley Morison. He studied the work of among others D.B. Updike, Edward Johnson and Arthur S. Osley. Fernand Baudin is described as someone with a lively mind. His numerous interests, even outside his field, make him a many-sided and very likeable person. With short and striking statements he reveals his fascinating personality. For example: ‚ÄúThere are two levels of design: that of the page and that of the whole book. Everyone should be familiar with composing a page. The whole book will always remain the task of the designer‚Äù. He later donated his archive to the Free University of Brussels. The total collection was classified by Fernand Baudin himself. It includes, besides a large number of publications and books, more than a hundred files such like correspondence, manuscripts, typescripts, proofs and prins of his articles and conferences, as well as many documents that give insight in his career as a graphic designer. Career = Employment = After leaving school and serving as a prisoner of war Fernand searched for a stable employment which was with the Brussels branch of type-foundry ‚ÄòAmsterdam‚Äô. During the twelve years of his employment, from 1954 to 1966, he met with different designers such like Dick Dooijes and Willem Ovink. Throughout his career he received assignments mainly for small- scale printed matter and so stayed on as freelance typographer and consultant. = Organisations = Baudin was part of national and international typographic organisations, like ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale), the Graphica-Belgica Prize, Rencontres internationales de Lure, the Royal Library of Belgium, and the Plantin-Moretus Prize. Through all these organisations he met with different graphic designers, whom he kept a (handwritten) correspondence with throughout his career: Stanley Morison, Gerrit Noordzij, Rosemary Sassoon, Nicolete Gray, John Dreyfus...  ATypI  Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI), is a French society that provides meetings for people professionally or otherwise concerned with typography. It was founded in 1957 and Baudin has been a member since. In 1991 he became vice-president. At a meeting in Hamburg on 12 June 1985 he suggested the idea for ‚ÄòA tentative scheme for the abc programme or series of the so- called Printing and the Hand of Man project, abc and more letterforms‚Äô. For quite a while the Dutch were superior on these meetings, whereas Baudin was the only Belgian present.  Graphica-Belgica Prize  The Graphica- Belgica Prize is an award that is given to the best technically and graphically designed book. It was founded in 1962 on the initiative of Count de Villages de Clercamps. Baudin won the prize two times before he was asked to be a member of the jury. He edited and designed the reports.  Rencontres internationales de Lure  Rencontres internationales de Lure is an organisation where different artists come together every year and talk about various problems in the graphic arts. It was established in the early fifties by Maximilien Vox, together with Robert Ranc and Jean Garcia. Fernand Baudin attended from 1958 to 1974. With every meeting there would be a report published which would include the topics that were discussed. From 1960 onwards Baudin made same-like reports for the Belgian press. First in La revue graphique, later Imprivaria, and Grafisch tijdschrift. He edited Dossier Michel Butor (21st meeting) and Dossier mise en page (22nd meeting). He concluded his activities with Dossier Vox (25th meeting).  Royal Library of Belgium  In 1956 Fernand Baudin approached the chief curator at the Royal Library, Herman Liebaers, and asked him if there was a job available. Liebaers who appreciated well designed books saw an opportunity to introduce a house style for the library and so hired Fernand as a typographic consultant. During his career he worked regularly for the library. At request by Liebaers, he even wrote a paper entitled L‚Äô√©criture des √©critures: la lettre avant l‚Äôimage.  Plantin-Moretus Prize  Plantin-Moretus Prize was founded by the Federation of Belgian Publishers. It awards the 20 best designed Belgian books of the year by giving them gold, silver and bronze medals. Fernand Baudin was elected chairman in 1975. Writings Fernand Baudin works are dominated by his love for the written word. Particularly handwriting in graphic design and its importance. He argued that literacy involves a knowledge about how to form letters and how to order them into a coherent visual structure. The space between letters, words and lines is as important as the type itself. He calls this ‚Äòvisual editing of text‚Äô. At the end of his career he wrote two books that sum up his ideas on writing and designing: How Typography Works (And why it is important) and L'Effet Gutenberg. His work is characterised by its simplicity and legibility. ‚ÄúIt is for the sake of the letter, for the sake of reading and ultimately for the sake of the reader that printing was invented now five hundred years ago‚Äù. His typography can be described as dynamic due to his so-called ‚Äòscissors and paste‚Äô work method. He always supplied one or more lay-outs, often done in ‚Äòcalque‚Äô, with information about where to place the illustrations and other things. Baudin's career came to an end just when the computer became an everyday object in the public's lives. Although he kept his distance from it, he still discussed the dangers and possibilities of it. Throughout his career there had been numerous inventions such like the typewriter and with the computer adding to it, it became more and more important for Baudin to talk about the importance of (hand)writing in graphic design. Because the computer made typography available to the masses, it was important that we should become more critical. ‚ÄúOur civilization of word and image does not depend on the computer. It depends on script and typeface. With computer assistance. For the time being. While waiting for something better. It is therefore necessary to learn and to teach how to distinguish between well-drawn letters and bad ones. Whatever the technique used to create them. One does not have to be a calligrapher to do this, just as one does not need to be a member of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise to teach French‚Äù. = How Typography Works (And why it is important) = How Typography Works is the English version of La Typografie au Tableau Noir which was first published in French in 1984. The book gives a general introduction to the subject of letterforms and layout. It discusses among others the variations and the principles of letter design but also the layout of pages from papyrus fragments to the modern newspaper. How Typography Works also gives a glimpse at Baudin's philosophical ideas on the meaning of literacy in the modern age. It can be used by teachers as a manual. It's written in Baudin's handwriting and is accompanied by his own illustrations. The result is a dynamic work in which the character of Baudin is prominently visible. Before How Typography Works, Fernand Baudin wrote De drukletter (1965). Which could also be considered as a manual for typography. It includes chapters on various typefaces, type sizes, book formats, punctuation marks... = L‚ÄôEffet Gutenberg = L‚ÄôEffet Gutenberg (1994) talks about 500 years of typography. The first pages are on pre-Gutenberg manuscripts followed by chapters on Plantin, Moxon, Fournier, Baskerville, Bodoni, Thibaudeau, Morison, Tschichold & Zapf. Afterwards there are pages with considerations about writing and the computer and to finish there are annexes on Morison, Kandinsky, Bayer, Tschichold, Albers... = Selected Writings = Next to his two books How Typography Works (And why it is important) and L'Effet Gutenberg, Fernand Baudin has written essays on writing, typography and (book) design in the Belgian and international periodicals Arts et techniques graphiques, Cahiers GUTenberg, Letterletter, and Visible Language, amongst others. * Baudin, Fernand, \\"The manuscript book\\", The Penrose Annual, London, Hastings House, vol. 67, d√©cembre 1974, p. 121-136. * Baudin, Fernand, \\"Education in the making and shaping of written words\\", by Rosemary Sassoon, Computers and Typography, England, Oxford, 1993, p. 102-129. * Baudin, Fernand, How Typography Works (And why it is Important), Lund Humphries Publishers Ltd, 1989.

Teacher Baudin had always a desire to communicate his vision on typography to anyone who would be interested to learn more about it. Until the end of his career he was asked numerous times to give classes, lectures or contribute to papers. ‚ÄúFernand gives the impression of being a cheerful fellow. He is agile and presents himself as a fluent talker. And while he talks it never takes him long to get on typography and the importance of type. Typography earns him his living, but that is not the end of the matter for him. He talks about typography because he loves it with every fibre of his being. This is what makes him happy: he belongs to the enviable minority of people who can say that their hobby has become their work and their work their hobby‚Äù. In 1986 he was asked to speak at a colloquium organised by the University of Namur. His lecture was called: ‚ÄòPour la qualit√© ‚Äútypographique‚Äù en informatique‚Äô. The focus was on the relationship between information provider and consumer. Fernand Baudin Prize Three years after his death, the Prize for the Most Beautiful Books in Brussels and Wallonia was named after him, called the Fernand Baudin Prize. Unfortunately the prize does no longer exist. In the years when it was still active, books of any category could be submitted. Then an international jury would make a selection. They question what ‚Äúa most beautiful book‚Äù is and discuss not only the concept of the book but also the realisation used such as printing and binding methods. The prize wanted to support and encourage contemporary bookmaking in Brussels and Wallonia. By doing that they highlighted graphic design as a creative industry and got more public awareness.

As a result of losing these lands he and 2 others were granted, in 1761, a township named Pondicherry, now Bridgton, Maine, seven miles square, east of the Saco River. He was one of three who proceeded to lay out the township and received the land grant for the entire township on June 25, 1765.

The company is known for developing a 5-seat hybrid, vertical take-off and landing, VTOL concept, SkyCruiser, and for its drone/UAV prototype, SkyProwler. Both aircraft employ the switchblade transformation mechanism to transform from a multirotor aircraft for vertical take-off and landing, to a pure winged aircraft, for rapid and efficient cruise. Krossblade SkyCruiser SkyCruiser is a concept of a vertical take-off and landing transformer aircraft with limited road drive capability. It has 5 seats and is powered by a hybrid power train. While all rotors and propellers are driven by electric motors, the electric energy is produced by a 400 hp internal combustion engine mated to a generator. A small battery provides backup storage of electric energy enabling SkyCruiser to briefly fly purely on stored electric power. SkyCruiser is able to fly at speeds in excess of 300 mph with a range of around 1,000 miles. Although capable of driving on roads, SkyCruiser is optimized for flight. Fast cruise bridges larger distances rapidly, while the VTOL capability enables it to land at or very close to its passengers‚Äô destination. SkyCruiser is scheduled to come to market at the end of the current decade. Krossblade SkyProwler title=Krossblade SkyProwler SkyProwler is a UAV/drone prototype used by Krossblade to develop the essential mechanisms and concepts for the larger SkyCruiser. It is a purely electrical aircraft that utilizes the switchblade mechanism to transform from multirotor-mode for VTOL to a pure aircraft mode for fast and efficient cruise. Possible applications include delivery. SkyProwler flies with speeds of up to 55 mph. Switchblade mechanism Rather than employing a rigid frame to mount motors and rotors as is done in quadcopters and other multirotors, in the switchblade mechanism motors and rotors are mounted on movable arms. These arms can pivot and so enable storage of the rotors and motors inside the fuselage, where they do not cause aerodynamic drag and hence enable to aircraft to fly faster and more efficient. Compared to a pure winged aircraft, the VTOL system, including the switchblade mechanism, increases the weight of an aircraft by around 15%.

But his only appearance in first-class cricket at Cambridge was in a 12-a-side match against the Gentlemen of England; he batted at No 12 in his only innings and failed to score, and he bowled 10 overs and failed to take a wicket. Prosser graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1893. He became a schoolmaster and was headmaster of Snettisham Grange Preparatory School in Norfolk.

In the film industry he appeared in over 100 films, although the majority of those were film shorts. He began on the stage during the 1870s, and appeared in at least one Broadway play, Charles Frohman's 1899 production of Because She Loved Him So. His first appearance in film was in a 1910 short, The Legacy, in which he starred. His first appearance in a feature film was in The Strange Story of Sylvia Gray. In addition to the over 100 shorts he was in, Eldridge appeared in 27 feature films between 1914 and 1922. In his roles in full-length films, he would usually appear in a supporting role, although occasionally be given a lead, as in 1917's Polly of the Circus, 1920's Broken Hearts, and 1922's Ashamed of Parents. Polly of the Circus was notable for being the first film released by Goldwyn Pictures, which was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey, mostly at rented space at the studios owned by Universal Studios. His final screen appearance was in a supporting role in the 1922 film, No Trespassing, which starred Irene Castle of the famous dancing team, Vernon and Irene Castle. No Trespassing was released on June 11, 1922, and Eldridge died soon after, on October 29, 1922, in New York City. Eldridge was married to actress Addie Dunant for 32 years until her death in 1914.

It was used extensively by the British Army and was exported to countries such as Holland, Switzerland, Sweden Finland and South Africa. In British service, it was used with the 5.25 inch and QF 3.7 inch AA guns, as well as the Brakemine missile. Mk. 7 developed from experiments in the mid-WWII era on auto-follow radar systems on the GL Mk. III radar and Searchlight Control radar systems. Production was not taken up at that time due to the imminent arrival of the SCR-584. The concept was studied again in the immediate post-war era, further improvements made, and put into production starting in 1952. About 365 were made in three major production runs, the last ordered in 1954. The unit was housed in an air- conditioned trailer that was significantly smaller and more portable than the World War II-era SCR-584 and GL Mk. III radars it replaced; the Blue Cedar weighed about 5 short tons, compared to about double that for the SCR-584. It was normally towed by an AEC Matador artillery tractor unit, as opposed to requiring a semi-trailer. It could be emplaced and operational in under an hour, automatically feeding data though synchros to the gunnery computer and then directly to the guns. Blue Cedar was the primary gun-laying system for the Army through the 1950s. Beginning in 1953, the air defence mission began to move from the Army to the Royal Air Force, and from anti-aircraft artillery to surface-to-air missiles, which had their own radars. It remained in service with field units, notably the British Army of the Rhine, until 1957 when large AA guns began to be replaced by the Thunderbird missile. Some were converted into counter-battery radars known as the Mk. 7(F). These, and other modifications for roles like weather balloon tracking, kept numbers of Blue Cedar in service well into the 1970s. South Africa (Army Anti-Aircraft artillery) scrapped the 3 MK 7 in 1969 after it was replaced by the Contraves Super Fledermaus. History =GL Mk. I & II= The early GL radars were very large, this is just the transmitter for the GL Mk. II. The British Army's first radars were intended to measure the distance to aircraft as an aiming aid for anti-aircraft artillery. In the 1930s, measuring the angle to the target was easily accomplished with optical instruments, but rangefinding remained a time-consuming and inaccurate process. This led to the creation of the GL Mk. I radar which was introduced in 1939. It quickly became clear that a range-only system was wasting considerable utility inherent to the design. Since the radar's signal spread over about 20 degrees, it observed a wide area of the sky and was able to detect targets before the crews on the optical instruments could. Additionally, it worked at night or in bad weather. This led to the GL Mk. II design which also measured angles with enough accuracy to directly lay the guns, removing the need for the optical instruments entirely. However, as this was not immediately available, a modification of the existing Mk. I's, the Mk. I/EF, was used until the Mk. IIs became more widely available in 1941. While these systems worked, they were unwieldy. The size of an antenna needed to efficiently broadcast and receive a signal is a function of the wavelength, so with the GL's ~4 m wavelength, antenna elements several meters across were needed. Focussing such a signal requires several such antennas, or one antenna and a suitable reflector, making the complete antenna system much larger. In the case of the GL radars, the antennas were supported on large steel frameworks about 10 m across, rather less portable than desired. =GL Mk. III= The introduction of the cavity magnetron in 1940 led to a revolution in radar design. A simple device the size of a fist generated tens of kilowatts of radio energy, rivalling some of the most powerful room- filling broadcasters. More importantly, it operated at wavelengths that were much shorter than any existing system; at ~10 cm, the antennas were only a few centimetres long, making them very easy to fit on aircraft and small vehicles. They were so small that it became practical to use a parabolic reflector to focus them, producing beams only a few degrees wide from an assembly perhaps a meter across, or smaller. Initially, most work with the magnetron was focused on airborne roles, where its small size was an enormous advantage. However, as the winds of war changed, there was increasing demand for a new anti-aircraft radar that could replace the existing GL's with something that was far more practical, and in particular, much more mobile. In November 1940 the magnetron had been demonstrated to Canadian and US researchers, both of whom had begun developing their own versions of GL based on it. After some initial work, the three countries agreed that Canada and the UK would work on a simple system that could be deployed as quickly as possible, while the US would work on a much more advanced system. The result of all this work was the GL Mk. III radar, versions of which were built by both the Canadians and UK firms. The Canadian version reached service first, with early production examples being shipped to the UK in November 1942. However, these proved highly unreliable in the field, and they used a mechanical indicator system instead of cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which required the crews to undergo retraining. Production quantities of the UK version, which used CRTs, did not begin to arrive until the middle of 1943. =Technical developments= As the Mk. III's were being designed, two new concepts were being developed that greatly improved radar designs. The first advance came as part of the development of airborne microwave radars. The Mk. 3 used separate transmit and receive antennas because they lacked a suitable way to rapidly switch the antenna feed from the transmitter to receiver. Using two reflectors was not going to work on aircraft, and the Air Ministry teams, now known as the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), continued looking for solutions. In March 1941 this arrived in the form of the soft Sutton tube, a simple vacuum tube device that switched from input to the output so rapidly as to be effectively instant. The second was part of the development of lock-follow systems. At the end of 1940, the Army began introducing its latest radar, the Searchlight Control radar (SLC). This was a simple system that was attached directly to a searchlight to allow it to easily find targets at night. The system used a unique arrangement of four antennas connected together in pairs, up/down and left/right. Three operators were required, each with their own CRT display. One display received the signal from all four antennas, showing every target in the area, and its operator selected one for tracking. The other two CRTs received the signals from the up/down, left/right pairs. By comparing the height of the blips, their operators could see which antenna was closer to the target, and turn the light in that direction to track it. In 1941, an engineer at BTH, L.C. Ludbrook, began development of a lock-follow system for the SLC. This used simple electronics that were fed the paired signals and output a current whose magnitude depended on the amount of difference between the two. This signal was then sent into amplidynes that amplified the signal and drove motors that turned the light. Only a single operator was needed; they selected a target on their CRT, and then the rest of the operation was completely automated. This was not only more accurate, but it also eliminated two crewmen and their CRTs, both of which were in short supply. Ludbrook's system was not put into production for the SLC systems, but the idea quickly caught the interest of the entire radar establishment. A number of different designs using different underlying electronics or drivers were introduced around the same time. There was a brief attempt to adapt the Canadian Mk. IIIs to use auto-follow, but as this system swung the entire cabin around to track, the power required to drive the pointing motors was huge. Lock-follow was experimented with on the British Mk. IIIs, which turned only the antennas, producing the 3/1 and 3/3 models. Both efforts were eventually abandoned. Instead, it was decided to combine lock-follow and the Sutton switch into a new set, which began development in 1942. As part of a general reorganization of their radar efforts, the Army renamed the existing Mk. III sets as the AA No. 3 Mk. 1 for the Canadian sets and Mk. 2 for the UK versions. The new design was given the name AA No. 3 Mk. 4. =SCR-584= By 1943, the US project had produced the SCR-584. Like the Mk. 4, it incorporated both the Sutton tube and a lock-follow system. However, it also included a search feature that spun the antenna and produced a plan-position indicator display, allowing a second operator to look for new targets anywhere within about before handing off a selected target to the tracking operator. The SCR-584 was originally expected in late 1943, before the Mk. 4, which was then put on low- priority development. However, the sets did not begin to arrive in significant numbers until the middle of 1944. As the delays grew, the Mk. 4 was put back into full development, and the first prototypes began to arrive in 1944, just as the supply of the SCR-584 improved. Development was once again curtailed. This all proved to be lucky timing, as the arrival of production SCR-584s was coincident with the start of the V-1 flying bomb campaign that summer. The combination of the SCR-584, the proximity fuse and new electro-mechanical predictors like the M-9 dramatically increased the effectiveness of anti- aircraft artillery, and they proved to be a very effective weapon against the high-speed V-1's. =Mk. 7= While the SCR-584 was an enormous advance on previous systems, it was also large and somewhat cumbersome. In the immediate post-war era, the magnetron saw rapid development and improvement, and new vacuum tubes were becoming widely available that combined multiple tubes into one. It was decided to re-engineer the Mk. 4 concepts with these new technologies, resulting in the Mk. 7 effort, which started in The Mk. 7 was very similar to the SCR-584 conceptually but had a number of practical improvements. One was to use a parabolic reflector made of fibreglass instead of metal, featuring a ridge around the outside edge to provide stiffness. This resulted in a lighter antenna overall, thereby reducing the weight of the supporting elements as well. As a result of these changes, the Mk. 7 was able to be packed into a small trailer roughly half the size and weight of the SCR-584. Like most post-war Army projects, development of the Mk. 7 took place at a snail's pace. Estimates that another war would be at least ten years off suggested no major production should take place, as developments in the interim would render any radars built in that period obsolete. However, various events in 1949, notably the first Soviet atomic test, led to sweeping upgrades, including the first contract for production Mk. 7's. These began to arrive in 1952.

They combined them with their own predictor, the Hasler-built Kommandoger√§t (\\"command device\\") 43/50R. Like its British counterpart, the 43/50R could be fed information directly from the Mk. 7 and in turn feed the guns. They also sometimes paired the Mk. 7 with the US-built AN/TPS-1 tactical control radar for initial cueing. The Mk. 7 began to be replaced in 1965 by the Oerlikon Contraves Super Fledermaus.

Domestication is thought to have occurred on two occasions, first about ten thousand years ago in the Fertile Crescent and again later, several thousand kilometres further east. Description Wild barley is an annual grass and is very similar in form to cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare) but has slightly narrower leaves, longer stems, longer awns, a brittle rachis, a longer, more slender seed spike and smaller grains. Characteristics of the wild plant that enhance its survival and dispersal include the brittle rachis (the central part of the seed head), which breaks when the grain is ripe, and the hulled seeds, which are arranged in two rows. In cultivated varieties, the rachis is more durable and the seeds are usually arranged in four or six rows. In the east, barley is usually grown for human consumption and the naked form of the grain is preferred, while in the west, the hulled form is mainly grown. It is used for animal feed and for the production of malt for brewing. Distribution and habitat Wild barley is native to North Africa, the Middle East, parts of the Indian subcontinent and south-west China. Its range includes Libya, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Crete, Cyprus, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, India and the Sichuan and Xizang provinces of China. Wild barley is found in a wide range of locations varying from deserts to Mediterranean-type habitats and highland habitats. It is exposed to many environmental stresses including high temperatures, drought and high soil salinity and there are local adaptations to the microclimates in which it grows. This wild plant is potentially a genetic resource useful for the breeding of stress-tolerant varieties of the cultivated crop. Domestication The domestication of barley probably occurred around 10,000 years ago in the Israel and Jordan region of the Fertile Crescent. Barley grains have been found at a number of archaeological sites in this area and the wild barleys here are more molecularly similar to the cultivated gene pool than are any other wild populations. AFLP technology indicates single domestication of barley, not, as had previously been hypothesized, a series of domestications in different parts of its range such as in Ethiopia and in the Mediterranean region. Further research using haplotype frequency in different geographic parts of the range led to the inference that there were at least two domestication events, one in the Fertile Crescent and another some further east. The former gave rise to the cultivars grown in Europe and America while the latter gave rise to the diversity of cultivated crops in central Asia and the Far East.

Golden Cycle controlled the Pikes Peak Consolidated Fuel Company, which had 15,000,000 tons of marketable coal, a 50% interest in East Colorado Springs Land Company, held more than a third interest in United Gold Mines in Cripple Creek and owned 400 acres in Cripple Creek. It operated a custom mill, treating up to 40,000 tons of Cripple Creek ore each month. The mill includes rolls, roasting furnaces and cyanide equipment. The Golden Cycle Mine was sold to Vindicator Consolidated Gold Mining in 1915 for $1,300,000 (). This was part of an overall plan by Carlton to consolidate or merge Vindicator, Golden Cycle, Cresson, Elkton, Union Gold, Findlay and Trail mines. Golden Cycle Mining and Reduction Company purchased U.S. Reduction and Refining Company of Fremont County, Colorado in 1916 after several forced sales. Golden Cycle sold the extensive machinery to Morse Brothers of Denver. By 1920, the company had decided to build a power plant near the Pikeview coal mine to supply power and light to Golden Cycle's subsidiaries nearby.

An openly gay Muslim, Zahed is the founder of the first European inclusive mosque, in Paris, France, with the goal of accommodating the LGBT and feminist Muslim communities. Zahed has been reported to be the first French Muslim man to be civilly married with another man, in South Africa.  Biography  Born Mohamed Lotfi Zahed in Algiers, Algeria, in 1977, he arrived in France a year later with his parents. During the Algerian Civil War, he returned to his birth city. Growing up between Algeria and France, he reported having felt \\"part boy, part girl\\" as a child. He realized his homosexuality at the age of 12 in Algeria, when he began having feelings for an older, male acquaintance. After a short period during which he took interest in Salafi Islam, the teenage Zahed dated a Frenchman whom he described as a \\"National Front voter from Vitrolles\\". He acquired French citizenship at the age of 20, adopting \\"Ludovic\\" as his first name. At the age of 21, he decided to come out to his family, getting mixed reactions. Initially rejecting Islam and following Buddhism instead, he eventually followed Islam again, and in 2010 founded the organization HM2F, Homosexuel(les) musulman(es) de France (Muslim Homosexuals of France). In November 2012, Zahed set up an \\"inclusive\\" Muslim prayer room in Paris, which has been described by the press as \\"Europe's first gay- friendly mosque\\". In April 2014, he took part in a series of lectures and seminars on \\"Rethinking Homosexuality in Islam\\" organised by Adi Bharat at Boston University. Holding a doctorate in humanities, he completed his doctoral study on the topic \\"Sexual Minorities at the Vanguard of Changes in the Islam of France\\", and published his social psychology doctoral thesis on \\"LGBT Muslims facing obscurantism and homonationalism\\" in 2016.  Personal life  Zahed is HIV-positive, having contracted the illness as a teenager. In 2011, while same-sex marriage had yet to be legalized in France, he legally married a South African man in Cape Town. They later moved to France, and were united by another, religious marriage ceremony (having no legal value in France) performed by an imam in 2012 in Sevran. In 2014, he was reportedly living with his husband in South Africa. = Political views = Ludovic- Mohamed Zahed has described himself as a \\"progressive Muslim\\" who argues that believers should \\"question institutional dogma\\" and insists that \\"neither homophobia or misogyny respect Islamic ethics\\". Through his works, he has voiced his concerns for the Muslim community in France, and LGBT Muslims in particular, who according to him, are facing both threats of \\"obscurantism\\" and \\"homonationalism\\". In France, he has openly stood in favor of same-sex marriage.  Controversies  The opening of a Muslim prayer room by Zahed in Paris, which he described as more \\"inclusive\\" to LGBT believers, was met with mixed reaction from the rest of the Muslim community in France, with a spokesman for the Grand Mosque of Paris stating that the prayer room was \\"outside the Islamic community\\" and that \\"the Quran condemns homosexuality\\". In 2014, two Muslim Iranian women were married by Zahed in a religious ceremony held in Stockholm, Sweden, which prompted a group of Algerian Salafists to demand that Zahed be stripped of his Algerian citizenship.

Gates was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul), and received his early education at Robert College in Istanbul, where his father (Caleb Frank Gates, 1857‚Äì1946) served as president. Gates came to the United States in 1919 and attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania for three years. In 1926, he graduated with honors from Princeton University and continued his studies under a Rhodes scholarship at Balliol College in Oxford. In 1928, while attending college, Gates married Elizabeth Farnum in England. They raised four children: Caleb Jr., Betsy Ann, Mary Ellen, and Gwynne. The couple returned to Turkey after Gates graduated from Balliol College with both B. A. and M. A. degrees. He taught history and served as headmaster of the preparatory school at Robert College from 1932 to 1933. Gates returned to Princeton for a year of graduate work in history and was eventually appointed history instructor at Princeton. He also served as assistant dean for three years until 1939, when the dean of the college became incapacitated and the full responsibility of the office rested with Gates. In 1941, Gates accepted the position of Chancellor at the University of Denver. At the age of 37, he was the youngest chancellor in the University's history. In 1943, Gates took a leave of absence from the University to join the army during World War II, with the rank of major.

Alter (1906‚Äì2006) served as the twelfth Chancellor at the University of Denver (DU) from 1953 to 1967. He was a scientist and an educator. He worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Background Chester M. Alter was born in rural Indiana on March 21, 1906. He earned his bachelor's degree from Ball State Teachers College in 1927 and his master's degree in 1928 from Indiana University Bloomington. He also completed some graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh during the 1928-1929 academic year. He married Arvilla Morrison in 1933 and had a son, Richard David Alter, six years later. In 1936, Alter earned his Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard University. Alter began his career as a teacher in the Indiana Public Schools. He later taught at Harvard and Boston University. He worked at Boston University as an instructor in chemistry from 1934‚Äì1953, becoming dean of the graduate school in 1944. Alter was recruited by the U. S. War Department to work on the Manhattan Project during World War II. This project resulted in the development of the atomic bomb. For his contributions he was awarded a Bronze Medal and a Certificate of Merit. He also served as a consultant for the Research and Development Board of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1953, Alter was offered the position of chancellor at the University of Denver. Career Alter was the twelfth chancellor of the University of Denver serving from 1953 to 1967. During his term of office, he initiated the construction of the Boettcher Science Center (1963), Cherrington Hall (1965), the Mass Communications Building, (1961) the Business Administration Building (1968), the Law Center (1965) Johnson-McFarlane Residence Hall (1960), Centennial Residence Hall (1961) and Centennial Residence Towers (1963).

Alter increased faculty salaries and was instrumental in attracting outstanding scholars such as Arnold Toynbee (visiting professor) and Averell Harriman (speaker) to the University. In 1961 Alter ended the University of Denver Football Program. His administration determined that expenditures on football programs were taking funding away from other more important programs. Alter wanted to see more funding for academic projects and intramural sports, which he thought would be of greater benefit to the entire University community. In 1964, during the DU centennial celebration, Alter was honored with the Evans Award from the Alumni Association of the University. After leaving the University of Denver in 1967, Alter served as a trustee in organizations such as the Gates Foundation, the Central City Opera Association, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and the George W. Clayton Trust. He was the first non-lawyer to be an officer of the American Judicature Society. In 1980 he was honored with the Justice Award for his service.

Alter also served in various scientific and professional organizations such as the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association of University Professors. The Chester M. Alter Arboretum at the University of Denver was named on April 30, 1999, to recognize his work and influence as the twelfth chancellor of the university and also for his well-known love for trees.

Appointed by President John F. Kennedy, he was the first African American to serve on the National Labor Relations Board where he served for 20 years under six presidents. Following the passage of the Landrum-Griffin Act Jenkins served as the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Management Reports, where he was the highest-ranking African American lawyer working in the federal government.  Early life and education  Howard Jenkins Jr. was born in Denver, Colorado, the third child of Howard and Nellie Poage Jenkins. Both of his parents were from Missouri. His father was a mail carrier and graduate of Lincoln University in Missouri. His mother graduated from college in Illinois. When Jenkins started at the University of Denver in 1932 he was the only male African American in the freshman class. He spent his sophomore year at the University of Colorado in Boulder. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1936 and from the University's College of Law in 1941. Although he was not the first African American to practice law in Colorado, he was the first African American to pass the Colorado Bar Examination.  Career in law  Howard Jenkins became interested in law when he accompanied his best friend to watch his friend's father, Sam Cary, try court cases. Sam Cary was one of the first African American lawyers in Denver. Jenkins practiced law in Denver until 1946, first in private practice, then in the Denver Office of Price Administration with Edward E. Pringle and Max Melville, then at the Denver War Production Board with James C. Flanigan and Edward Scheunemann. In 1943 Jenkins was appointed Regional Attorney for the National War Labor Board, and in 1945 its Chief Regional Enforcement Officer.  Howard University  George Johnson, the dean of Howard University Law School, asked Jenkins to join the faculty. Jenkins taught labor law and administrative law at the law school and medical jurisprudence to medical students, from 1946 until 1956.  Career in government service  Jenkins then went to work in Washington, D.C. for William Willard Wirtz on the National Wage Stabilization Board, and joined the faculty at Howard University School of Law. As a law professor he helped prepare briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to desegregate the railroads and the public schools, including the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. In 1956, Jenkins became the special assistant to the Solicitor of Labor. While special assistant, he was intimately involved in drafting and passing the Landrum-Griffin Labor Reform Act, known as the Employees' Bill of Rights. In 1959, Jenkins was named Director of the Office of Regulations at the Bureau of Labor-Management Reports. In 1962, he was named Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau and became the highest-ranking African American attorney in the federal government. In 1963, Jenkins became the first African American to be appointed to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when nominated by President John F. Kennedy. Jenkins was reappointed by three subsequent presidents and served on the NLRB for 20 years.  Impact  Howard Jenkins Jr. had a substantial impact on labor law during his years of service. His mission was to help them discover blacks in the industrial work force, and to get it firmly fixed in our national labor policy that discrimination on the basis of race or sex is an unfair labor practice. He wrote the majority opinion in the 1964 watershed case Hughes Tool Co. II, which created unions' duty of fair representation. He also wrote a dissent, affirmed by the courts, holding that it was illegal sex discrimination for unions to have a waiters' union and a separate waitresses' union.University of Denver Special Collections/Archives. Howard Jenkins Jr. Papers. Finding aid is open access/public domain  Personal life  Jenkins met Alice Elaine Brown in 1935, the daughter of a prominent African American minister, when she was a freshman. After she graduated from the University of Denver in 1937 she became the first African American teacher in the Denver Public School system. In 1940 the couple married.

Earning his reputation for his pioneering work in linocut and woodcut, he explored neotraditionalism, Romanian nationalism, and Romanian folklore, and was ultimately drawn into politics with the Iron Guard. He helped steer several art groups associated or integrated with the Guard, contributed to its fascist propaganda, and briefly served in the Assembly of Deputies. He survived the clampdown of the late 1930s, returning to apolitical work with Grupul Grafic, and exploring the legacy of Byzantine art. Under the National Legionary State, Bassarab returned to favor as one of the leading political iconographers, also urging others to contribute \\"epic\\" art in support of the regime. Arrested during the civil strife of early 1941, Bassarab was allowed to redeem himself on the Eastern Front.

Salonul oficial de toamnƒÉ\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 12/1940, p.663-64 During that interval, the Guard accorded its assassinated and exhumed founder, Codreanu, a lavish second funeral.

There, the Guard's patron, the Archangel Michael, watches over an infant at his feet. Above, a legend gives Codreanu's birthdate, giving the image a religious and propagandistic impact. Another drawing of his draws upon folklore to place Codreanu in the context of the Miori»õa legend.TeacƒÉ, p.201 In December 1940, Bassarab organized an exhibit, Munca legionarƒÉ (\\"Legionary Labor\\"), also at Sala Dalles, which represented a fusion of art with Guardist ideology.ScƒÉiceanu, p.384; TeacƒÉ, passim It was attended by Traian BrƒÉileanu, the Arts Minister, and Guard Commander Horia Sima.TeacƒÉ, p.202 Soon afterwards, the Guard fell from power, and Bassarab was arrested on orders from ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu. When Romania entered World War II in June 1941 as part of Operation Barbarossa, Bassarab was placed into a frontline unit with a high risk of casualties, participating in the recovery of Bessarabia. He vanished outside »öiganca. Legends began circulating that he had been killed while demining a field with his bare hands. Another account has it that he had been taken prisoner by the Red Army, detained at Chi»ôinƒÉu, and finally slashed with a bayonet when he protested against the torturing of a Romanian officer.Nicolae Goga, \\"Necrolog. Arh. Constantin Joja\\", in Buletinul Comisiei Na»õionale a Monumentelor, Ansamblurilor »ôi Siturilor Istorice, Nr. 2/1991, p.58 The most likely version is that he was captured and shot at »öiganca, in retaliation for the Romanians' treatment of Soviet prisoners.Morariu, p.32; ScƒÉiceanu, p.384; TeacƒÉ, p.200 An obituary by Comarnescu saw print in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, praising Bassarab as the \\"laborer-artist\\" who, in dying, lived up to his \\"heroic perspective on art\\": \\"it was given to him that he should accomplish more as a Romanian soldier than as an artist, his very sound debut notwithstanding.\\" Bassarab's propaganda work was formally banned soon after Antonescu's downfall, as the new democratic regime and the Allied Commission clamped down on all forms of fascist literature and art. His widow, who had a degree in philology, never remarried. She survived the rise and fall of Communist Romania and died in 1999 at age 95. Their son »òerban, born in 1940, pursued a career as a mathematician.Morariu, p.32 His father's work was again explored after the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

The ruins of the castle depending on the name are dating back to the 11th century (St. Martin), or 16th century (≈†abec), while by archeological evidence to the second half of the 14th century. The castle was vastly devastated in the Uskok War (1615‚Äì17). Between 2009 and 2014 the castle was restored. Nearby the castle there is also a small Church of St. Martin from 1367.  History  Posert Castle (Schabez) viewed from the southeast side, 1679 Until now the castle was considered as the same fortress with different names, of St. Martin, Posert and ≈†abec, which in several occasions were separately mentioned and built, but that wasn't confirmed by archaeological research. It is still unknown whether they were at the same or different locations. The castle was associated with Castrum Sancti Martini from the 11th century, mentioned in the grant by Ulric II to Aquileia patriarchs. In the second half of 14th century St. Martin belonged to the Pazin county. Its lords were Gutenegg family, and when in 1436 became part of the Moysevich (Moise, Mojsijeviƒá) family estate, that area was named Posshart, while suburb as Possert. In the 16th century, Juraj (or Giorgio) Barbo, of the Barbo family who inherited Moysevich estate and Ko≈æljak in 1529, allegedly built new fortress ≈†abec. Between 1614 and 1617, during the Venice-Uskok war, both St. Martin (or Possert) and ≈†abec area were occupied and destroyed. As ≈†abec was in ruins and abandoned, Juraj decided to build a new castle Belaj south of it. According to archeological excavations the castle is dated to the second half of the 14th century. This indicates that the castle was possibly built by Counts of Gorizia who were the lords of the area until 1374, or by the Habsburg family who inherited their estates.  Description  The castle is of irregular trapezoidal layout with rectangular angle tower. The layout broad side is faced toward north. It consists of center in the northern part, and of external fortified yard in the central and southern part. The guard tower is best preserved. It had five floors, preserved to a height of with irregular layout, long by wide.

His most well-known composition is the theme from the television sitcom I Love Lucy. Daniel was born in Boston on January 7, 1908. His first known song was \\"What Would People Say\\", released by Decca Records in 1938. He subsequently became a fixture among Hollywood songwriters, with songs recorded by artists such as Guy Lombardo, Dinah Shore, Gene Autry, Bing Crosby, Burl Ives, Sarah Vaughan, and Marilyn Monroe. He earned Oscar nominations for writing \\"Lavender Blue\\" for the 1949 film So Dear to My Heart and for the lyrics to \\"Never\\" for 1951's Golden Girl. Collaborating with Johnny Lange in 1947, he wrote the classic Western song \\"Blue Shadows on the Trail\\". Surprisingly, Daniel's most famous composition was outside the mainstream of his movie work: the I Love Lucy theme song. He composed it on the condition that his name would not be associated with it. Being primarily known for film work, he didn't want to be connected to the unproven new medium of television. He was also pessimistic about the prospects for the show's success. Later on, he sought credit for the song and received royalties from syndicated reruns. In 1957 and 1958, he served as president of the 16,000 member Local 47 of the American Federation of Musicians. During his tenure he led a strike against six motion picture studios. Eliot Daniel died on December 6, 1997 in Placerville, California.

He played as forward. Hauser started his youth football with local club SV Schopfheim. He also played a few years in their senior team. In 1964 he transferred to Basel and played there for eight years, the first under trainer Georges Sobotka and seven under trainer Helmut Benthaus. He won the Swiss Championship four times and was Swiss Cup winner once. In the eight seasons in which Hauser played for Basel, he played a total of 287 games for the club scoring a total of 180 goals. 146 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 27 games were in the domestic cup, 42 were in European competitions and 82 games were test games. 70 of the goals were in the domestic league, 17 were in the cup, 20 were in European competitions (European Cup, Cup of the Alps and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup) and the other 73 were in the tests. Hauser won his first championship title in Basel's 1966‚Äì67 season. Basel finished the championship one point clear of FC Z√ºrich who finished in second position. Basel won 16 of the 26 games, drawing eight, losing twice, and they scored 60 goals conceding just 20. Roberto Frigerio was the team's top goal scorer with 16 league goals and Hauser second best goal scorer with 14 league goals in 18 appearances. In that season Hauser won the double with Basel. In the Cup final on 15 May 1967 Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In the former Wankdorf Stadium, Hauser scored the decisive goal via penalty. The game went down in football history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1‚Äì1, referee Karl G√∂ppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty. Andr√© Grob√©ty had pushed Hauser gently in the back and he let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to the 2‚Äì1 for Basel the Lausanne players refused to resume the game and they sat down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee had to abandon the match. Basel were awarded the cup with a 3‚Äì0 forfait. His second title was won in Basel's 1968‚Äì69 season. The team finished the season one point clear of second placed Lausanne Sports. Basel won 13 of their 26 games, drawing ten, losing three times, they scored 48 goals conceding 28. Hauser played 19 domestic league games, he scored 10 league goals and was the team's best goalscorer. Hauser won the championship with Basel for the third time at the end of the season 1969‚Äì70. The team again finished one point clear of Lausanne Sports who ended the season in second position again. Basel won 15 of the 26 games, drawing seven, losing four times, they scored 59 and conceded 23 goals. Hauser played 24 domestic league games, he scored 14 league goals and again was the team's best goalscorer. His fourth title was won in Basel's 1971‚Äì72 season.

It was their 21st consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after their promotion the season 1945‚Äì46. They now played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium, in the south-eastern end of the city and no longer in their old stadium Landhof. Harry Thommen took over as club chairman at the AGM from Lucien Schmidlin who retired and became vice-chairman.  Overview  During this season Helmut Benthaus was the club player-manager for the second consecutive season. There were only a few minor changes in the squad. Walter Baumann moved to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Silvan Schwager moved to St. Gallen and Bruno Gabrieli moved to Grasshopper Club. Peter F√ºri moved on to SC Binningen and here he ended his football career. In the other direction Peter Ramseier joined the club from Cantonal Neuchatel and Anton Schnyder joined from Servette. There were 14 teams contesting in the 1966‚Äì67 Nationalliga A and Basel finished the seasons as champions just one point clear of both FC Z√ºrich in second position and FC Lugano who finished third. Basel won 16 of the 26 games, drawing eight, losing twice, and they scored 60 goals conceding just 20. Roberto Frigerio was the team's top goal scorer with 16 league goals, Helmut Hauser second best goal scorer with 14. In the highest scoring game of the season, a 10‚Äì0 win against FC Moutier Roberto 'Mucho' Frigerio managed to score four and in the test game against FC Allschwil he scored six in the 9‚Äì1 victory. In the Swiss Cup Basel started in the round of 32 with a 6‚Äì0 home win against Blue Stars and in the round of 16, also a home match, they beat FC Z√ºrich 3‚Äì2. In the Quarter-final Basel won the replay against Biel-Bienne 2‚Äì1 to qualify for the semi-finals. Basel played an away match in the Stadio Cornaredo against FC Lugano in the semi-final which ended goalless and therefore a replay was required here too. The replay was played in the St. Jakob Stadium and goals from Karl Odermatt and Helmut Benthaus gave Basel a 2‚Äì1 victory to qualify for the final which was to take place three days later. In the Cup final Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In the former Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via penalty. The game went down in football history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1‚Äì1, referee Karl G√∂ppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty. Andr√© Grob√©ty had pushed Hauser gently in the back and he let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to the 2‚Äì1 for Basel the Lausanne players refused to resume the game and they sat down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee had to abandon the match. Basel were awarded the cup with a 3‚Äì0 forfait. Basel had won the double for the first time in the club's history. In the first round of the 1966‚Äì67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Basel were drawn against VV DOS Utrecht. The first leg was played in the Netherlands and ended in a 2‚Äì1 defeat, despite an early lead. In the return leg Basel led 2‚Äì0 but VV DOS were able to equalise and therefore won 4‚Äì3 on aggregate.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Politics On 22 June 1860, William Nelson, one of the three members for West Moreton, was unseated by petition. Joseph Fleming was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the resulting by-election on 9 July 1860. Fleming held the seat until he resigned on 3 November 1862 when he became bankrupt. Joshua Peter Bell won the resulting by-election on 15 December 1862. On 7 August 1866, the Premier of Queensland and member for West Moreton, Robert Herbert, resigned. Joseph Fleming won the resulting by-election on 11 September 1866. He held the seat until 2 July 1867 (the 1867 election) when he was defeated by Joshua Peter Bell (sitting member), Patrick O'Sullivan and George Thorn. In 2017 a crypt in an unmarked section of Ipswich General Cemetery was found to contain the remains of Fleming and his wife Phoebe. The crypt was located in the 1990s and sealed over at the time to prevent vandalism. In October 2018 the crypt was excavated by archaeologists and students from the University of Southern Queensland. The remains of Fleming, and his wife and daughter, are scheduled to be re-interned in July 2019.

The elections coincided with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate and various state and local elections. Primary elections were originally scheduled for March 15, but were moved to June 7, due to successful challenges to the 1st and 12th congressional districts in federal court and the drawing of new maps affecting almost all of the state's districts. Long before the court had ruled, candidates had filed for the March 15 party primaries for each district under the old maps in December 2015, per the North Carolina State Board of Elections. After the court ruled and the North Carolina General Assembly passed new district maps, the State Board established a filing period for the new primary date for candidates of major parties, March 16‚Äì25. Candidates had to refile for the June 7 primary, if they still chose to run, in any district they chose. The results of the March 15 primary, which went ahead because ballots had already been printed and mailed to absentee voters by the time of the ruling, were not counted. 2016 North Carolina redistricting This image shows the 2016‚Äì2020 court-ordered NC Congressional districts.http://www.ncleg.net/representation/Content/Plans/PlanPage_DB_2016.asp?Plan=2016_Contingent_Congressional_Plan_- _Corrected&Body;=Congress The North Carolina Legislature's 2012 redistricting was found unconstitutional by the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina and replaced on February 19, 2016.http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics- government/article58760423.html District 1 The 1st district is located in Northeastern North Carolina.

The railway station was opened by the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) on its Moray Firth coast line in 1886, served by Aberdeen to Elgin trains. In 1923 the GNoSR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway and at nationalisation in 1948 became part of British Railways. The station and line was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. History =Background= In 1881 the Great North of Scotland Railway put a bill to parliament to extend its Portsoy line along the Moray Firth as far as Buckie. In 1882 the Great North of Scotland applied for permission to build a line from Portsoy following the coast to Buckie and then running on to Elgin. =Great North of Scotland Railway= The GNoSR station opened as 'Cullen' on 1 May 1886 with the central section of the coast line, served by through Aberdeen to Elgin trains.

Flothow (leaning against back wall) on the set of a film shoot in the 1930s. Rudolph C. Flothow with son Rudy and wife Martha Rudolph C. Flothow was a movie and television producer active from 1915 through the mid-1950s, producing more than 45 films and over 80 television episodes. Most of his productions were crime films for Columbia Pictures, including the 1943 Batman serial, and Crime Doctor, Whistler, Boston Blackie, and Ellery Queen films. He directed the sound sequences in the early sound feature Lucky Boy, starring George Jessel.  Life and career  Flothow was born November 23, 1895, in Frankfurt, Germany, into a mercantile family involved in the China shipping trade, and was apparently a distant relation of the Bavarian composer Friedrich von Flotow. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1914. He married a former model, Martha Tekla Sikorski, the daughter of Polish immigrants, and had one son, Rudy Flothow. His half-brother Wolfgang Hoeffer, a U.S. counterintelligence agent, was found shot to death in the immediate aftermath of Otto John's defection to East Germany. His earliest involvement in the film industry was in distribution, joining Paramount in 1915. Flothow consistently worked with small budgets, with film shoots typically lasting just 21 days. Flothow had a reputation for delivering a lot of movie for the money, an impression reinforced by Ralph Bellamy's recollection of Flothow as being \\"always on the set\\" during the filming of the Ellery Queen films. In the wake of the film industry's slowdown in the late 1940s, Flothow transitioned into the nascent television market, with the idea of doing for television syndication \\"...just what he had done before, hard-hitting, low-cost shows, a lot of male-driven action\\". The result was Ramar of the Jungle, a syndicated television program that reran for decades. The program's African setting had its source in Flothow's longstanding fascination with Africa, crystallizing in a dressing-room conversation with Jon Hall. Flothow \\"used a regular stable of heavies. He was actually very fond of these guys with mean faces who were actually very sweet.\\" References Category:American film producers Category:American television producers Category:1895 births Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Rudolph Flothow"},{"id":"45222376","text":"Mohammad Reza Rajabi (, born 10 January 1986) is an Iranian handball player for Naft Al-Janoob and the Iranian national team.

Skaf is the President of the Federa√ß√£o das Ind√∫strias do Estado de S√£o Paulo (FIESP), of Servi√ßo Social da Ind√∫stria (SESI-SP), of Servi√ßo Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial (Senai-SP), of Instituto Roberto Simonsen (IRS) and of Servi√ßo Brasileiro de Apoio √†s Micro e Pequenas Empresas (SEBRAE-SP). He is also the first Vice-President of Confedera√ß√£o Nacional da Ind√∫stria (CNI). Moreover, has always been active at industries businesses entities, such as Confedera√ß√£o Nacional da Ind√∫stria (CNI), at Sindicato das Ind√∫strias de Fia√ß√£o e Tecelagem do Estado de S√£o Paulo (Sindit√™xtil) and at Associa√ß√£o Brasileira da Ind√∫stria T√™xtil e de Confec√ß√£o (ABIT). At last, he was also member of the Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econ√¥mico e Social (CDES) of the President. Biography Paulo Skaf was born at Vila Mariana, a neighborhood of S√£o Paulo, son of Lebanese immigrant and prominent entrepreneur in the textile Antoine Skaf and Clotilde Habeyche Skaf. He attended the Col√©gio Elvira Brand√£o and finished his high school at Col√©gio Santo Am√©rico. He studied Business Administration at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie but dropped out before completion.http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/os-60-mais- poderosos/paulo-skaf/5213bc5f26db567e47000003.html In 1978, he met Luzia Helena Pamplona de Menezes, who arrived at the same year. They have five sons, Paulo, Andr√©, Raphael, Gabriel, and Antoine, and three grandchildren. In his teenage years, he started working with his father, but his entrepreneurial spirit soon flourished and made him follow his own steps. Dedicated in textile, his mid-sized factories was located at the east side of S√£o Paulo ‚Äì one at Ipiranga, another at Mooca and one at Belenzinho. In order to consolidate all in one unit, years later, it was relocated to Pindamonhangaba, at Vale do Para√≠ba. The arrival of the Koreans in Brazil and the downfall of his company‚Äôs products competitivity, he felt the necessity of a drastic measure and redirect his business. He then focused his investments to industrial construction sector. It was only after his activities in the real estate businesses that he realized another one of his passions: politics.  Business career  Skaf, besides business, stood out for his leadership and innovation in the textile sector, at the Sindicato das Ind√∫strias de Fia√ß√£o e Tecelagem do Estado de S√£o Paulo (Sindit√™xtil) and at the Associa√ß√£o Brasileira da Ind√∫stria T√™xtil e de Confec√ß√£o, for two mandates, where it developed an important part in the fashion industry. In September 27, 2004, it was elected, in his first mandate, as the President at Federa√ß√£o das Ind√∫strias do Estado de S√£o Paulo, at Ciesp, at Sesi-SP, at Senai-SP and at last for the Instituto Roberto Simonsen (IRS). At FIESP, his management focused in research of Brazil‚Äôs sustainable growth. The aim was always to work in order to obtain structural changes capable to provide a better public services back to society, mainly at education, health and security. Thus, as the head of the institution, Skaf innovated with the implementation of full time education and articulated the integration between high school and technical school. Nowadays, Sesi_SP is the major institution of private school in the country. In 2013, the number of enrollment at Senai-SP, surpassed 1,2 Millions and 150 thousands at Sesi- SP.http://www.dgabc.com.br/Noticia/102509/escolas-do-sesi-terao-periodo- integral-a-partir-de-2011 Skaf also actively worked in tax exemption, debureaucratization of processes, increasing the investments of infrastructure and expand external markets. Created a ‚Äúentrepreneurial diplomacy‚Äù policy, which helped in the formation of qualified human resources to operate in private sector with international matters and micro and small businesses act in the external Market, decisively contributing in the international insertion of Brazil. Another striking moment in Skaf‚Äôs trajectory was the action moved against the CPMF (tax applied in financial transaction). This taxation was implemented in 1997 and abolished in 2007 after a fierce dispute in the Senate. In S√£o Paulo, Skaf worked hard in order that the matter was discussed at specialized sector. In December 13, 2007, Skaf was able to celebrate the end of CPMF as the Senate declared its end from December 31 of the same year and preventing its reestablishment in 2008. An official notice from FIESP on behalf of Skaf, declared a ‚Äúvictory of Brasil‚Äù.http://ojornaldoestado.com.br/paulo-skaf-tem-interesse-em-disputar- governo-de-sao-paulo-em-2014/ It was also under his management in which FIESP led a campaign for two achievements: the creation of the General law for micro and small businesses and de dismiss of taxes over products derived from wheat, which led to a decrease in price of bread and pasta. In 2009, one of the most successful actions of Paulo Skaf was the decrease of 30% over spreads, easing the obtainment of bank credit, therefore, generating employment and production. Another highlight was the leadership at FIESP, defending the receipt, from exporters, of credits related to the legal reimbursement of IPI provided at external sales. In 2011, the campaign Energia a Pre√ßo Justo (Fair price for energy), with the aim to mobilize the population against the renovation without biddings from overdue energy companies. The result was a discount of 20% in the energy bills of brazilians, announced by brazilian government in 2013. This campaign was able to generate an economy of 30 billions per year. From June 2011 to April 2012, FIESP promoted a strong mobilization towards the provisional measure to put an end at the port war, resolution n¬∫ 72, and that it should be approved by the senate. This measure proposed the annulment of tax breaks over imported products via discount over the Imposto sobre Circula√ß√£o de Mercadoria e Servi√ßos (ICMS) putting an end to the so called port war. Another important achievement for the industry was the dismiss of payroll. After two years fighting, was enacted in 2013 the law that deprives taxation of social security contributions of employers in certain sectors, calculated over the payroll, which creates less pressure on the costs of those who produce and more Jobs for those who work. In 2013, FIESP campaigned for the approval of the provisional measure of the Ports, which provides for the modernization of port facilities, stimulating competition and moving lower priced cargoes. Also in 2013, FIESP and CIESP were able to stop the IPTU's abusive increase of an average of 55% in the residences and 88% in the commerce in the city of S√£o Paulo, which was well above the readjustment of the workers in the period, with a preliminary injunction in justice. Thus, the city of S√£o Paulo was only able to correct the IPTU for annual inflation.  Political career  Skaf's political career dates back to the 1970s, when, as a young man, he decided to join CPOR. \\"My vocation has always been to serve Brazil.\\" He once said in an interview. In addition to the business, Skaf was distinguished by his leadership as a leader of entities in the sector, such as the Sindit√™xtil and the Associa√ß√£o Brasileira da Ind√∫stria T√™xtil e de Confec√ß√£o (ABIT). On September 27, 2004, he assumed the Presidency of the Federation of Industries of the State of S√£o Paulo (Fiesp). He also took over Ciesp, Sesi-SP, Senai-SP and Instituto Roberto Simonsen (IRS), as well as being the first vice-president of CNI. He was also a member of the Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econ√¥mico e Social (CDES - Economic and Social Development Council) of the Presidency. At Fiesp, his management adopted measures such as the implementation of full-time education and the articulation of secondary education with the technician. This year, Sesi is the largest private education network in the country. In 2009, 1.2 million enrollments were registered in Senai-SP and 120 thousand in regular Sesi-SP education. Aside from this, Skaf also worked to tax exemptions, to debureaucratize processes, to increase investments in infrastructure, to expand foreign markets (created the \\"Business Diplomacy\\"). On September 30, 2009, Skaf joined the PSB, and in the 2010 elections, he applied for the PSB to government of S√£o Paulo. Despite the socialist legend, Skaf presented neoliberal proposals such as the collection of tuition fees in state public universities. He was ranked 4th with 1,038,430 votes (4.56% of the valid votes), behind Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB) - 1st place and elected in the first round with 11,519,314 votes (50.63% of the valid votes) Of Aloizio Mercadante (PT) - 2nd place with 8.016.866 votes (35.23% of valid votes) - and Celso Russomano (PP) - 3rd place with 1,233,897 votes (5.42% of valid votes). After invitation from Michel Temer, Skaf left the PSB in early 2011 and joined PMDB in S√£o Paulo. Skaf was again a candidate for the government of S√£o Paulo in 2014, now by the PMDB, obtaining the 2nd place with 4,594,708 votes (21.53% of the valid ones) - behind only the candidate for reelection Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB), who obtained 12,230,807 Votes (57.31% of the valid ones.  Honors  In August 2013, Skaf, as the President of FIESP, received a medal of Judicial Merit from Tribunal de Justi√ßa do Estado (State Court of Justice - TJ-SP) In May 2014, Skaf received on July 9th Medal in the Chamber of Ara√ßatuba. The honor was granted by FIESP's investments in SESI schools in the city. Skaf has already received medals, commendations and decorations, such as Order of Rio Branco; National Order of Merit, of the Republic of Colombia; Order for Merit for Distinguished Services, of the Republic of Peru; Order of Military Merit, of the Brazilian Army; Order of Naval Merit, of the Brazilian Navy; Order of Aeronautical Merit, of the Aeronautics of Brazil; Anhanguera Order of Merit, of the Government of the State of Goi√°s.

Towns and cities have a long history, although opinions vary on which ancient settlements are truly cities. The benefits of dense settlement included reduced transport costs, exchange of ideas, sharing of natural resources, large local markets, and in some cases amenities such as running water and sewage disposal. Possible costs would include higher rate of crime, higher mortality rates, higher cost of living, worse pollution, traffic and high commuting times. Cities grow when the benefits of proximity between people and firms are higher than the cost.  Origins  Excavated foundations of √áatalh√∂y√ºk, an Anatolian town dated to 7000 BC. There is not enough evidence to assert what conditions gave rise to the first cities. Some theorists have speculated on what they consider suitable pre-conditions and basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces. The conventional view holds that cities first formed after the Neolithic revolution. The Neolithic revolution brought agriculture, which made denser human populations possible, thereby supporting city development. Whether farming immigrants replaced foragers or foragers began farming is not clear. The increased food production per unit of land supported higher population density and more city-like activities. In his book, Cities and Economic Development, Paul Bairoch takes up this position in his argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities can form.Bassett, California Mohenjo-daro, a World Heritage site that was part of the Indus Valley Civilization Extent and major sites of the Indus Valley Civilization of ancient India Aerial photograph shows the remains of the Sumerian city Ur, near Nasiriyah, Iraq. According to Vere Gordon Childe, for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population. Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: \\"Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre\\". Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that \\"...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required. When the cost of transport is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometres ...\\". Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of Great Britain. The urban theorist Jane Jacobs suggests that city formation preceded the birth of agriculture, but this view is not widely accepted. In his book City Economics, Brendan O'Flaherty asserts \\"Cities could persist‚Äîas they have for thousands of years‚Äîonly if their advantages offset the disadvantages\\" . O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as increasing returns to scale and economies of scale, which are concepts usually associated with businesses. Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well. Increasing returns to scale occurs when \\"doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost\\". Similarly, \\"Are Cities Dying?\\", a paper by Harvard economist Edward L. Glaeser, delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people and ideas. Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if a city is doubled in size, workers get a ten percent increase in earnings. Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in. The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city. They do gain other benefits from living in cities, though. = Childe‚Äôs ten criteria = The first true towns are sometimes considered large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power were centralized. In 1950 Gordon Childe attempted to define a historic city with ten general metrics. These are: # Size and density of the population should be above normal. # Differentiation of the population. Not all residents grow their own food, leading to specialists. # Payment of taxes to a deity or king. # Monumental public buildings. # Those not producing their own food are supported by the king. # Systems of recording and practical science. # A system of writing. # Development of symbolic art. # Trade and import of raw materials. # Specialist craftsmen from outside the kin-group. This categorisation is descriptive, and it is used as a general touchstone when considering ancient cities, although not all have each of its characteristics. Ancient times Cain founding the city of Enoch The more complex human societies, called the first civilizations emerged around 3000 BC in the river valleys of Mesopotamia, Minoan, India, China, and Egypt. An increase in food production led to the significant growth in human population and the rise of cities. The peoples of Southwest Asia and Egypt laid the foundations of Western civilization, they developed cities and struggled with the problems of organised states as they moved from individual communities to larger territorial units and eventually to empires. Among these early civilizations, Egypt is exceptional for its apparent lack of big cities.Michael E. Smith, ‚ÄúEarliest Cities‚Äù; in Urban Life: Readings in the Anthropology of the City, Fourth Edition, ed. George Gmelch & Walter P. Zenner; Prospect Heights, Illinois: Waveland Press, 2002. The growth of the population of ancient civilizations, the formation of ancient empires concentrating political power, and the growth in commerce and manufacturing led to ever greater capital cities and centres of commerce and industry, with Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia of the Hellenistic civilization, Pataliputra (now Patna) in India, Chang'an (now Xi'an) in China, Carthage, ancient Rome, its eastern successor Constantinople (later Istanbul). The roster of early urban traditions is notable for its diversity. Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely populated political capitals, others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus. Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations. Theories that attempt to explain ancient urbanism by a single factor, such as economic benefit, fail to capture the range of variation documented by archaeologists.Smith 2002 = Mediterranean = View of the Agora of Athens with the temple of Hephaestus to the left and the Stoa of Attalos to the right Great Colonnade\\" marks the cardo maximus of Apamea, Syria. Ancient Mesopotamia, the area of the Tigris and Euphrates within modern day Iraq and Syria, was home to numerous cities by the third millennium BC. These cities formed the basis of the Sumerian and subsequent cultures.Adams (1981), p. 2. \\"Southern Mesopotamia was a land of cities. It became one precociously, before the end of the fourth millennium B.C. Urban traditions remained strong and virtually continuous through the vicissitudes of conquest, internal upheaval accompanied by widespread economic breakdown, and massive linguistic and population replacement. The symbolic and material content of civilization obviously changed, but its cultural ambience remained tied to cities.\\" Cities such as Jericho, Uruk, Ur, Ninevah, and Babylon, made legendary by the Bible, have been located and excavated, while others such as Damascus and Jerusalem have been continuously populated. The Phoenician trading empire, flourishing around the turn of the first millennium BC, encompassed numerous cities extending from Tyre, Cydon, and Byblos, across the Mediterranean to Carthage (in modern Tunisia) and C√°diz (in modern Spain). The name of Melqart, an important Phoenician deity, comes from M-L-K and Q-R-T, meaning \\"king\\" and \\"city\\".Georges Perrot & Charles Chipiez, History of Art in Ph≈ìnicia and Its Dependences, Vol. 1; translated from French to English and edited by Walter Armstrong; London: Chapman and Hall, 1885; p. 67. Beginning in the early first millennium, independent city-states in Greece began to flourish, evolving the notion of citizenship, becoming in the process the archetype of the free city, the polis. The agora, meaning \\"gathering place\\" or \\"assembly\\", was the center of athletic, artistic, spiritual and political life of the polis. These Greek city-states reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of classical Greece, expressed in architecture, drama, science, mathematics and philosophy, and nurtured in Athens under a democratic government. The Greek Hippodamus of Miletus (c. 407 BC) has been dubbed the \\"Father of City Planning\\" for his design of Miletus; the Hippodamian, or grid plan, was the basis for subsequent Greek and Roman cities., p.73-76 In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great commissioned Dinocrates of Rhodes to lay out his new city of Alexandria, the grandest example of idealized urban planning of the ancient Mediterranean world, where the city's regularity was facilitated by its level site near a mouth of the Nile. The rise of Rome again shifted the locus of political power, resulting in economic and demographic gain for the city of Rome itself, and a new political regime in the form of the Roman Empire. Rome founded many cities (coloniae), characteristically imposing a grid pattern made of north‚Äìsouth cardines and east‚Äìwest decumani. The intersection of the cardo maximus and the decumanus maximus marked the origin of the city grid. Following these standard plans, Rome founded hundreds of cities and exerted substantial influence toward urbanizing the Mediterranean. In the process, Rome developed sanitation, public housing, public buildings and the forum.Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 41‚Äì42. \\"Rome created an elaborate urban system. Roman colonies were organized as a means of securing Roman territory. The first thing that Romans did when they conquered new territories was to establish cities.\\" In the late Roman Empire political power was increasingly held by bishops of the Christian Church. = Asia = Song period at the capital, Bianjing, today's Kaifeng The Indus Valley Civilization and ancient China are two other areas with major indigenous urban traditions. Among the early Old World cities, Mohenjo-daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in present-day Pakistan, existing from about 2600 BC, was one of the largest, with a population of 50,000 or more and a sophisticated sanitation system.Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998) Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. Oxford University Press, Karachi and New York. China's planned cities date to the turn of the second millennium BC. City-states emerging at this time used geomancy to locate and plan cities, orienting their walls to cardinal points. Symbolic cities were constructed as celestial microcosms, with the central point corresponding to the pole star representing harmony and connection between the earthly and other realms. In Chang'an the imperial palace lay to the north, facing south, absorbing the light of the sun, and royalty slept with their heads to the north and their feet to the south. Next came the Imperial City, and then the people's city, divided into eastern and western halves.Southall (1998), pp. 38‚Äì43. = Sub-Saharan Africa = Agriculture was practiced in sub-Saharan Africa since the third millennium BC. Because of this, cities could develop as centers of non-agricultural activity, well before the influence of Arab urban culture. One of the oldest sites documented thus far, Jenn√©-Jeno in what is today Mali, has been dated to the third century BC. According to Roderick and Susan McIntosh, Jenn√©-Jeno did not fit into traditional Western conceptions of urbanity as it lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social class, but it should indeed be considered a city based on a functional redefinition of urban development. In particular, Jenn√©-Jeno featured settlement mounds arranged according to a horizontal, rather than vertical, power hierarchy, and served as a center of specialized production and exhibited functional interdependence with the surrounding hinterland.McIntosh, Roderic J., McIntosh, Susan Keech. \\"Early Urban Configurations on the Middle Niger: Clustered Cities and Landscapes of Power,\\" Chapter 5. Archaeological evidence from Jenn√©-Jeno, specifically the presence of non-West African glass beads dated from the third century BC to the fourth century AD, indicates that pre-Arabic trade contacts probably existed between Jenn√©-Jeno and North Africa. Additionally, other early urban centers in sub-Saharan Africa, dated to around 500 AD, include Awdaghust, Kumbi-Saleh the ancient capital of Ghana, and Maranda a center located on a trade rout between Egypt and Gao.History of African Cities South of the Sahara By Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch. 2005. = Americas = The Avenue of the Dead in Teotihuacan originates with the Pyramid of the Moon, forming the basis of the city grid. In the ancient Americas, early urban traditions developed in the Andes and Mesoamerica. In the Andes, the first urban centers developed in the Norte Chico civilization (also Caral or Caral-Supe civilization), Chavin and Moche cultures, followed by major cities in the Huari, Chimu and Inca cultures. The Norte Chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas, flourishing between the 30th century BC and the 18th century BC. Mesoamerica saw the rise of early urbanism in several cultural regions, including the Preclassic Maya, the Zapotec of Oaxaca, and Teotihuacan in central Mexico. Later cultures such as the Aztec drew on these earlier urban traditions. Teotihuacan, flourishing from 200 BC to AD 750, was the largest American city of the pre-Columbian era, possibly reaching a population of 125,000 in AD 200. The city's grid plan originated with the \\"Avenue of the Dead\\", connecting the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and the Pyramid of the Moon.Ren√© Millon, cited in Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 37‚Äì38. \\"The regularity of Teotihuac√°n began with the main street, the \\"Street of the Dead,\\" which stretched from the Great Compound and the Temple of Quetzacoatal to another great pyramid, the Pyramid of the Moon. Every other major street, and even the river running through the city, was laid out either parallel or perpendicular to this grand avenue.\\" Beyond its ceremonial center the city featured religious buildings (23 temple complexes) and myriad workshops. Although its religious system was clearly expansive and significant, details of its political and economic functioning remain matters of speculation.Southall (1998), 48‚Äì50. Middle Ages Constantinople, the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th through the 12th century The Round city of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq In the remnants of the Roman Empire, cities of late antiquity at first gained independence, but lost their population and their importance, starting in Roman Britain and Germania. The locus of power in the West shifted to Constantinople and to the ascendant Islamic civilization with its major cities Baghdad, Cairo, and C√≥rdoba.Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 43. \\"Capitals like C√≥rdoba and Cairo had populations of about 500,000; Baghdad probably had a population of more than 1 million. This urban heritage would continue despite the conquests of the Seljuk Turks and the later Crusades. China, the longest standing civilization, was in the midst of a golden age as the Tang dynasty gave way‚Äîafter a short period of fragmentation‚Äîto the Song dynasty. This dynasty ruled two of the most impressive cities on the planet, Xian and Hangzhou. / In contrast, poor Western Europe had not recovered from the sacking of Rome and the collapse of the western half of the Roman Empire. For more than five centuries a steady process of deurbanization‚Äîwhereby the population living in cities and the number of cities declined precipitously‚Äîhad converted a prosperous landscape into a scary wilderness, overrun with bandits, warlords, and rude settlements.\\" From the 9th through the end of the 12th century, Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, with a population approaching 1 million. Following the Byzantine‚ÄìOttoman wars and other conflicts, the Ottoman Empire gained control over many cities in the Mediterranean area, including Constantinople in 1453. During the European Middle Ages, a town was as much a political entity as a collection of houses. City residence brought freedom from customary rural obligations to lord and community: \\"Stadtluft macht frei\\" (\\"City air makes you free\\") was a saying in Germany. In Continental Europe cities with a legislature of their own were not unheard of, the laws for towns as a rule other than for the countryside, the lord of a town often being another than for surrounding land. In the Holy Roman Empire, some cities had no other lord than the emperor. Some planned towns were created, in Britain by King Edward I to colonize Wales and in France, bastides, fortified cities designed on a regular plan.Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 52. \\"Many cities were constructed with fortifications, or bastides, in mind. These fortifications would often take the form of a regular geometric shape, with towers laid out a[t] regular intervals, and gates allowing entrance into the city itself. The streets within the Bastide city were likewise regularly placed, intended to connect logically to each other, to the central market square, and to the town gates. The placement and pattern of streets was also intended to facilitate the movement of armaments and men to the city defenses. Building took place after the layout had been imposed, creating a more orderly landscape.\\" By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries some cities become powerful states, taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires. In Italy medieval communes developed into city-states including the Republic of Venice and the Republic of Genoa. These cities, with populations in the tens of thousands, amassed enormous wealth by means of extensive trade in eastern luxury goods such as spices and silk, as well as iron, timber, and slaves. Venice introduced the ghetto, a specially regulated neighborhood for Jews only. In Northern Europe, cities including L√ºbeck and Bruges formed the Hanseatic League for collective defense and commerce. Their power was later challenged and eclipsed by the Dutch commercial cities of Ghent, Ypres, and Amsterdam. (City rights were granted by nobility.) The city's central function was commerce, enabled by waterways and ports; the cities themselves were heavily fortified with walls and sometimes moats.Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 47‚Äì50. Similar phenomena existed elsewhere, as in the case of Sakai, which enjoyed a considerable autonomy in late medieval Japan. In the first millennium AD, an urban tradition developed in the Khmer region of Cambodia, where Angkor grew into one of the largest cities (in area) of the world.Evans et al., A comprehensive archaeological map of the world's largest preindustrial settlement complex at Angkor, Cambodia, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, August 23, 2007. The closest rival to Angkor, the Mayan city of Tikal in Guatemala, was between in total size.\\"Map reveals ancient urban sprawl,\\" BBC News, 14 August 2007. Although its population remains a topic of research and debate, newly identified agricultural systems in the Angkor area may have supported up to one million people.Metropolis: Angkor, the world's first mega-city, The Independent, August 15, 2007 Palmanova, Italy, constructed in 1593 according to the defensive ideal of the star fort, today retains its distinctive geometry. Gda≈Ñsk in the 17th century While the city-states, or poleis, of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea languished from the 16th century, Western Europe's larger capitals grew again as commercial hubs, especially following the emergence of an Atlantic trade. By the early 19th century, London had become the largest city in the world with a population of over a million, while Paris rivaled the well-developed regionally traditional capital cities of Baghdad, Beijing, Istanbul and Kyoto. Bastion forts arose in an attempt to make cities defensible against strengthening military firepower. The Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, in present-day Mexico, had an estimated population between 200,000 and 300,000 when the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s arrived in 1519. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas the old Roman city concept was extensively used. Cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories, and were bound to several laws about administration, finances and urbanism. Most towns remained small, so that in 1500 only some two dozen places in the world contained more than 100,000 inhabitants. As late as 1700, there were fewer than forty, a figure that rose to 300 in 1900. Industrial revolution Glasgow slum in 1871 The growth of modern industry from the late 18th century onward led to massive urbanization and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas. England led the way as London became the capital of a world empire and cities across the country grew in locations strategic for manufacturing.Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 53‚Äì54. \\"England was clearly at the center of these changes. London became the first truly global city by placing itself within the new global economy. English colonialism in North America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and later Africa and China helped to further fatten the wallets of many of its merchants. These colonies would later provide many of the raw materials for industrial production. England's hinterland was no longer confined to a portion of the world; it effectively became a global hinterland.\\" In the United States from 1860 to 1910, the introduction of railroads reduced transportation costs, and large manufacturing centers began to emerge, fueling migration from rural to city areas. Industrialized cities became deadly places to live, due to health problems resulting from overcrowding, occupational hazards of industry, contaminated water and air, poor sanitation, and communicable diseases such as typhoid and cholera. Factories and slums emerged as regular features of the urban landscape.Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 54‚Äì55. =Infrastructure= The 19th century saw the rise of public transportation, such as horsebuses, followed by horse trams. At the end of the 19th century, electric urban rail transport (including trams and rapid transit) began to replace them, later completed with buses and other motor vehicles. Street lights were uncommon until gas lighting became widespread in Europe in the early 19th century. Fuel gas was also used for heating and cooking. From the 1880s, electrification began, making electricity the main energy medium in cities until present day. Modern water supply networks began to expand during the 19th century. 20th century Growth of cities continued through the twentieth century and increased dramatically in the Third World (including India, China, and Africa), due to industrialization, active promotion of urbanization, and other factors. Urban planning became widespread and professionalized. At the turn of the century, the \\"garden city\\" model became the icon of a self-contained, comprehensively designed, residential and commercial settlement. Professional urban planners appeared in large numbers, not only to design cities, but to provide technical expertise to their administration. Cities in the great depression of the 1930s, especially those with a base in heavy industry, were hard hit by unemployment. In the U.S. urbanization rate increased forty to eighty percent during 1900‚Äì1990. Today the world's population is slightly over half urban, and continues to urbanize, with roughly a million people moving into cities every 24 hours worldwide. During the 20th century, car ownership has increased steady, parallel with suburban sprawl, highways and other development for the car. Awareness of ecology in the mid-20th century created the environmental movement, which has addressed the need for sustainable development. In the second half of the twentieth century, deindustrialization (or \\"economic restructuring\\") in the West led to poverty, homelessness, and urban decay in formerly prosperous cities. America's \\"Steel Belt\\" became a \\"Rust Belt\\" and cities such as Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana began to shrink, contrary to the global trend of massive urban expansion.Steven High, Industrial Sunset: The Making of North America's Rust Belt, 1969-1984; University of Toronto Press, 2003; . \\"It is now clear that the deindustrialization thesis is part myth and part fact. Robert Z. Lawrence, for example, uses aggregate economic data to show that manufacturing employment in the United States did not decline but actually increased from 16.8 million in 1960, to 20.1 million in 1973, and 20.3 million in 1980. However, manufacturing employment was in relative decline. Barry Bluestone noted that manufacturing represented a decreasing proportion of the U.S. labour force, from 26.2 per cent in 1973 to 22.1 per cent in 1980. Studies in Canada have likewise shown that manufacturing employment was only in relative decline during these years. Yet mills and factories did close, and towns and cities lost their industries. John Cumbler submitted that 'depressions do not manifest themselves only at moments of national economic collapse' such as in the 1930s, but 'also recur in scattered sites across the nation in regions, in industries, and in communities.'\\" Under the Great Leap Forward and subsequent five-year plans continuing today, the People's Republic of China has undergone concomitant urbanization and industrialization to become the world's leading manufacturer.James Xiaohe Zhang, \\"Rapid urbanization in China and its impact on the world economy\\"; 16th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, \\"New Challenges for Global Trade in a Rapidly Changing World\\", Shanhai Institute of Foreign Trade, June 12‚Äì14, 2013.Ian Johnson, \\"China‚Äôs Great Uprooting: Moving 250 Million Into Cities\\"; New York Times, 15 June 2013. 21st century There is a debate about whether technology and instantaneous communications are making cities obsolete, or reinforcing the importance of big cities as centres of the knowledge economy.Castells, M.

(2008) The Logic of Life. London: Little, Brown. Knowledge-based development of cities, globalization of innovation networks, and broadband services are driving forces of a new city planning paradigm towards smart cities that use technology and communication to create more efficient agglomerations in terms of competitiveness, innovation, environment, energy, utilities, governance, and delivery of services to the citizen. Some companies are building brand new masterplanned cities from scratch on greenfield sites. * Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, India * Nano City, India * Putrajaya, Malaysia * Bonifacio Global City, Philippines * King Abdullah Economic City, Saudi Arabia * Sejong City, South Korea * Songdo International Business District, South Korea * Dubai Waterfront, United Arab Emirates * Dubai World Central, United Arab Emirates * Masdar City, United Arab Emirates  See also  * History of water supply and sanitation * List of oldest continuously inhabited cities  Notes   References  = Bibliography = * Adams, Robert McC.

His father, Petru Cupcea (1875‚Äì1940), was a priest, later the Protopope of Supur and honorary Archdeacon, who was active in the Romanian National Party from 1909. Although ethnically Romanian, his paternal and maternal ancestors, the Cupceas and the Rednics, had been received into the Hungarian nobility of Partium, tracing their aristocratic titles to 1609 and 1349 respectively.C√¢mpean (2010), pp. 144‚Äì148 Petru's wife, Augusta, was the distant descendant of peasants from Tiream, and daughter of George Pteancu.C√¢mpean (2010), pp. 98‚Äì100, 145 A Romanian educator and honorary citizen of Carei, Pteancu was also leader of the Marian Congregation branch in NƒÉsƒÉud.

She was for a while married one of Salvator's physician colleagues, Victor Munteanu, and had a son by him, Dan Munteanu, who became a noted biologist.C√¢mpean (2010), pp. 148, 270‚Äì272 Another sister, Lucia, became the wife of Leontin Ghergariu (1897‚Äì1980), a philologist, adult educator, museum curator and sports enthusiast.C√¢mpean (2008), pp. 118‚Äì121; (2010), p. 148 The youngest of the Cupcea siblings, Emilia, taught at the Biological Institute of Cluj.C√¢mpean (2010), p. 148 Cupcea's early childhood saw the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the region's incorporation with Romania. Directly involved in the process, Alexandru Pteancu was appointed chief inspector of secondary schools by the Romanian-led Regional Directorate.C√¢mpean (2008), pp. 112, 244 There followed an interlude of Hungarian Soviet rule, during which Inspector Pteancu narrowly escaped execution.C√¢mpean (2008), p. 244; Teodor Ne»ô, Oameni din Bihor: 1848‚Äì1918, Tipografia DiecezanƒÉ, Oradea, 1937, pp. 522‚Äì523 Father Cupcea, who had pledged Carei's support for the Great Assembly, was also targeted, being kidnapped and sent to Debrecen, where he was reportedly tortured.C√¢mpean (2010), pp. 146‚Äì147; Valer Hossu, \\"Episcopul Iuliu Hossu √Æn apƒÉrarea 'pƒÉr»õilor ungurene' abia unite cu Rom√¢nia\\", in Caiete Silvane, January 2009 Rescued by his coreligionists, he made his way to Oradea, which fell to the Romanians in the military operations of 1919.C√¢mpean (2010), p. 147 =Early career= In 1925, when Cri»ôana had been secured for Greater Romania, Salvator graduated from Carei's Lucaciu High School, where he had become best friends with his schoolmate, Alexandru Ro»ôca.JurcƒÉu & Ro»ôca, p. 89 They both had a keen interest in psychology, and were urged on by their schoolteachers to pursue studies in the field.JurcƒÉu & Ro»ôca, p. 88 Enlisting at the University of Cluj (known back then as \\"Upper Dacia University\\"), they attended the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, specializing under Professor Florian »òtefƒÉnescu-GoangƒÉ at the Cluj Institute of Psychology. Together, they worked on »òtefƒÉnescu- GoangƒÉ's applied psychology teams, alongside various other young men who became figures of importance on the scientific, political, and literary scene: Nicolae MƒÉrgineanu, Mihai Beniuc, Liviu Rusu, Lucian Bologa, and Teodor Bugnariu. Taking a degree in Psychology, Pedagogy and Aesthetics (February 1931),\\"ChemƒÉri la catedre universitare\\", p. 10870 Cupcea also attended the Faculty of Medicine, where he earned a diploma in psychiatry, after which he took a position on the staff of the Mental Hospital in Sibiu. In early 1935, he was among the founders of the Romanian Psychoanalytic Circle and an editor of its magazine, Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ de PsihanalizƒÉ, with which he sought to promote a more complete understanding of Sigmund Freud and his work.\\"Revista Revistelor.

As noted by author Nicolae BalotƒÉ, who was also an employee of the Psychology Institute, they \\"contributed discreetly (and, what is more, prudently)\\" to the Iron Guard.

Corneliu Coposu cƒÉtre profesorul Ion IvƒÉnescu\\", in Caiete Silvane, October 2010 In 1940, at the height of World War II, Northern Transylvania, including Cluj, was ceded by Romania to Hungary following the Second Vienna Award. The entire university and its logistics moved to Sibiu. Cupcea remained in contact with his colleagues, publishing in Revista de Psihologie: in 1941, Constitu»õia morfologicƒÉ la bolnavii mintal (\\"The Morphological Built of the Mentally Ill\\"); in 1944, √éncercarea unui sistem de psihopatologie constitu»õionalƒÉ evolutiv (\\"Sketching a System of Progressive Bodily Psychopathology\\").JurcƒÉu & Ro»ôca, pp. 94‚Äì95 He based these studies on the impact of health on intelligence, and the theories of Ernst Kretschmer, by examining the body types of university students, industrial workers and mental patients in relation to their intelligence quotient and state of mind, describing various correlations.\\"ChemƒÉri la catedre universitare\\", p. 10871 A disciple of physician and eugenicist Iuliu Moldovan, he frequented ASTRA Society and published in its paper the 1941 tract Ce este Eugenia (\\"What Eugenics Is\\"). It discussed \\"the improvement of the genetic dowry\\" through both positive and negative measures.Butaru, pp. 25‚Äì26 Quoting Moldovan and Francis Galton, Cupcea tried to delimit his field of interest from Nazi racial science (too radical) and euthenics (too mild), preferring Moldovan's term \\"hygiene of the nation\\".Vornica, pp. 221‚Äì223 At the time, he expressed himself as a supporter of strict biological determinism, and demanded the universal introduction of prenuptial examinations to filter out the dysgenics.E.

Described by his friends as a \\"gentleman of imposing stature\\" and a fine public speaker, he was attracted into teaching. From 1942, he hosted a seminar of \\"mental hygiene\\" and medical genetics, under Moldovan's guidance.\\"ChemƒÉri la catedre universitare\\", pp. 10870‚Äì10871 In 1943, the university assigned him a lecturer's position in his alma mater, the Faculty of Medicine, where his oratorical skill drew in crowds. Cupcea also affiliated with Moldovan's Institute of Hygiene and Biopolitics, as a researcher, and, taking a diploma in Public Health and Hygiene in 1944, as a section leader. His studies merged psychiatry and criminology, investigating the role of emotional instability disorder as a gateway to other psychiatric conditions in the general population, and its supposed presence as \\"impulsiveness\\" among the criminal population.\\"ChemƒÉri la catedre universitare\\", pp. 10871‚Äì10872 In August 1944, King Michael's Coup aligned Romania with the Allies, while also ushering in a Soviet occupation. Discarding fascism, Cupcea and Ro»ôca sought a rapprochement with the PCdR, passing themselves off as committed communists. ASTRA published Cupcea's introduction to Biologia teoreticƒÉ ≈üi aplicatƒÉ √Æn U.R.S.S. (\\"Theoretical and Applied Biology in the USSR\\"), which was a condemnation of scientific racism and social Darwinism, as well as a tentative defense of non-racial eugenics. The article announced that the era of eugenics as a separate discipline was coming to an end, as eugenics had infused the work values of Soviet biologists, especially those at the Maxim Gorky Medico-Biological Research Institute.Marius Turda, Aaron Gillette, Latin Eugenics in Comparative Perspective, Bloomsbury Publishing, London & New York City, 2014, , p. 243. See also Butaru, p. 217 In one of his eugenic tracts for that year, he circulated the notion that genes \\"do not produce characteristics per se, but rather provide certain evolutionary guidelines\\", which suggested to his readers that pedagogy had a major role in cultivating innate qualities.Bucur, p. 158 =Ministerial post and later life= In 1945, Cupcea joined the Health Ministry staff as a general secretary,\\"ChemƒÉri la catedre universitare\\", p. 10872 under Premier Petru Groza and Minister Dumitru Bagdasar. On April 11, 1946, preparing for his retirement, Bagdasar delegated to Cupcea \\"all the rights that come with the office of minister [...], excepting those that are strictly reserved for the minister as head of his department and cannot therefore be delegated.\\"\\"Ministerul SƒÉnƒÉtƒÉ»õii. √émputerniciri\\", in Monitorul Oficial, April 17, 1946, pp. 3965‚Äì3966 Following Bagdasar's resignation and death, Cupcea effectively became the acting minister.Bucur, pp. 41, 217 In August 1946, he spoke at the national conference on people's health, where he presented a report on the dire conditions facing \\"today's democratic government\\": \\"One million syphilitics, one and a half million gonorrhea victims, 600,000 tuberculosis victims, an 18 per cent infant mortality‚Äîthat is the legacy of our past, the legacy of historical regimes\\".M.

In parallel, he worked on a regional medical task-force formed by the Romanian Academy, while presiding over the Hygiene Institute, the Cluj clinics, and the local Medical Society. In 1948, he was one of three Romanian representatives to the founding congress of the World Health Organization, where he proposed the creation of a Mental Hygiene Committee and concrete backing for national research programs.Actes officiels de l'Organisation mondiale de la Sant√©; no. 13: Premi√®re Assembl√©e mondiale de la Sant√©.

After 34 years in France, he once more lives in Portugal. His work combines Figuration Libre, French street art of the 1980s, digital imaging and Art singulier. Early life and education Born in Aldeia da Dona, Sabugal, Portugal, he moved to France in 1963 and was educated there. He began making art at the age of 12 with comic strips. Career In 1977, he started hanging out in Paris, initially interested by rock and other urban music. Not being interested in making music himself, he started promoting friends' groups with hand-made posters that he had photocopied, and also by stencilling groups' names. In 1979, at the invitation of his drawing instructor, he had his first group show, and the same year with Joaquim Pereira he founded the group \\"Explorateurs du gris\\". In 1980 he came up with the concept of Nukl√©-Art, global interdisciplinary art for the children of the Nuclear Age; in 1984 this led to his co-founding the group of the same name with Kriki (Christian Vall√©e) and Paul Etherno. The group dissolved in mid-1987 into the M√©dias-Peintres, whose activities are close to those of Figuration Libre, including street stencilling, postering of painted work and performance art. Nukl√©-Art exhibited at gallery Patras and the Galerie Photo graffitis, participated in the first Binoche sale, the 1986 Les jeunes d√©barquent and are in the book Pochoir a la Une and in Jacques Renard's film Murmures Impatiens in the series Paris impromptu. In 1990, he painted on the Berlin Wall, on 9 of the 1,300 metres that remain and make up the East Side Gallery. He painted there again in 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the wall. In the 1990s he exhibited at Paris galleries including Anne Rouff, Christophe, and the galerie sanguine.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly.  Pastoralist  Haly and his brother William O'Grady Haly arrived in Australia from Newfoundland in 1838 and settled on the Hunter River before moving to the Gwydir River. From there they assembled a team of men and some 5,000 sheep and travelled north through the Logan district during the early 1840s in search of land. Shearing records indicate the Haly brothers had settled Taabinga station by 1846, at which time it was an established sheep property covering 305 square miles. Despite their early occupation of the land, the Haly brothers did not apply for a lease over Taabinga until June 1850, which was granted on 10 February 1852 for a term of 14 years. By 1853, Charles Haly was at Tamrookum in the Logan district, where he married Rosa Harpur and was to remain until at least 1854. During this time it is most likely that either William Haly or a superintendent was managing Taabinga station. When his brother William returned to England in 1859, Charles became sole lessee of Taabinga. In 1863 he acquired a freehold over 314 acres of the run and remained at the property until 1875 when he moved to Dalby. Politics Charles Haly was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in Burnett at the inaugural 1860 colonial election on 4 May 1860. He held the seat until the 1863 election on 24 June. On the 19 June 1861 C. R. Haly, Esq., M.P., was a witness at the Select Committee on the Native Police Force, at which he supported the work of the Native Police. On 15 April 1865, John Edwards, the member for Burnett, resigned. Charles Haly won the resulting by- election on 13 May 1865. He held the seat until 6 April 1867. On 6 April 1869, Robert Mackenzie, former Premier and member for Burnett, retired from politics and departed for Europe. Charles Haly won the resulting by-election on 21 April 1869. Haley held the seat until he resigned on 23 March 1871. John Bramston won the resulting by-election on 3 April 1871. On 8 December 1875, Edmund Royds, member for Leichhardt, resigned. Charles Haly won the resulting by-election on 12 January 1876. He held the seat until 14 November 1878 (the 1878 election).

In effect, dialogic education takes place through dialogue by opening up dialogic spaces for the co-construction of new meaning to take place within a gap of differing perspectives. In a dialogic classroom, students are encouraged to build on their own and others‚Äô ideas,Alexander, R. J. (2006). Towards dialogic teaching: Rethinking classroom talk. Cambridge: Dialogos. resulting not only in education through dialogue but also education for dialogue.  History  Dialogic education is argued to have historical roots in ancient oral educational traditions. The chavrusa rabbinic approach, for example, involved pairs of learners analysing, discussing, and debating shared texts during the era of the Tannaim (approximately 10-220 CE).Hezser, Catherine (1997). The social structure of the rabbinic movement in Roman Palestine. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck. . OCLC 723016390. Dialogue was also a defining feature of early-Indian texts, rituals and practices that spread across Asia with the rise of Buddhism.Sen, Amartya (2005). The argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian history, culture and identity. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. . OCLC 936760401. Indeed, one of the earliest references to an idea of dialogue is in the Rigveda (c. 1700-1100 BC), where the poet asks the deities Mitra and Varuna to defend him from the one ‚Äúwho has no pleasure in questioning, or in repeated calling, or in dialogue‚Äù.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurie-l-patton/the-biggest-loser-in- the-_1_b_4852776.html Later, Buddhist educators such as Nichiren (1222-1282) would themselves present work in a dialogic form.Miller, G. D. (2002). Peace, value, and wisdom: The educational philosophy of Daisaku Ikeda (Vol. 122). Rodopi. P.13 It has also be linked to traditional Islamic education with Halaqat al-‚ÄôIlm, or Halaqa for short, in mosque-based education whereby small groups participate in discussion and questioning in 'circles of knowledge'.Makdisi, G. (1990) The Rise of Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West; Edinburgh University Press. A dialogic element has similarly been found in Confucian education.Li, L., & Wegerif, R. (2014). What does it mean to teach thinking in China? Challenging and developing notions of ‚ÄòConfucian education‚Äô. Thinking skills and creativity, 11, 22-32 Links are often also made with the Socratic method, established by Socrates (470-399 BC), which is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions. There is some debate over whether the Socratic method should be understood as dialectic rather than as dialogic.Nikulin, D. (2010). Dialectic and Dialogue. Stanford: Stanford University Press. Kindle Edition However it is interpreted, Socrate's approach as described by Plato has been influential in informing modern day conceptions of dialogue, particularly in Western culture. This is not withstanding the fact that dialogic educational practices may have existed in Ancient Greece prior to the life of Socrates.Apatow, Robert (1998). The spiritual art of dialogue: Mastering communication for personal growth, relationships, and the workplace. Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions. Over the last five decades, robust research evidence has mounted on the impact of dialogic education.https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and- evaluation/projects/dialogic-teaching A growing body of research indicates that dialogic methods lead to improved performance in students‚Äô content knowledge, text comprehension, and reasoning capabilities.Clarke, S. N., Resnick, L. B., Penstein Ros√©, C., Corno, L., & Anderman, E. M. (2016). Dialogic instruction: a new frontier. Handbook of educational psychology. 3rd ed. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, 278-388. The field has not, however, been without controversy. Indeed, dialogic strategies may be challenging to realise in educational practice given limited time and other pressures. It has also been acknowledged that forms of cultural imperialism may be encouraged through the implementation of a dialogic approach.  Definitions of dialogic  There is a lack of clarity around what is meant by the term ‚Äòdialogic‚Äô when used to refer to educational approaches. The term ‚Äòdialogue‚Äô itself is derived from two words in classical Greek, ‚Äòdia‚Äô meaning ‚Äòthrough‚Äô and ‚Äòlogos‚Äô meaning ‚Äòword‚Äô or 'discourse'.https://www2.clarku.edu/difficultdialogues/learn/index.cfm Dialogic is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as an adjective applied to describe anything ‚Äòrelating to or in the form of dialogue‚Äô.https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/dialogic Dialogic can also be used in contrast to ‚Äòmonologic‚Äô, which is the idea that there is only one true perspective and so that everything has one final correct meaning or truth. Dialogic, however, contends that there is always more than one voice in play behind any kind of explicit claim to knowledge. If knowledge is a product of dialogue it follows that knowledge is never final since the questions we ask and so the answers that we receive, will continue to change. Dialogic education has been defined as engaging students in an ongoing process of shared enquiry taking the form of a dialogueWells, G. (1999). Dialogic inquiry: Towards a sociocultural practice and theory of education.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. and as Robin Alexander outlines in his work on dialogic teaching, it involves drawing students into a process of co- constructing knowledge. Rupert Wegerif sums this up by claiming that 'Dialogic Education is education for dialogue as well as education through dialogue'.Wegerif, R. (2013). Dialogic: Education for the internet age. Routledge  Approaches to dialogic education  Dialogic approaches to education typically involve dialogue in the form of face-to-face talk including questioning and exploring ideas within a ‚Äòdialogic space‚Äô but can also encompass other instances where 'signs' are exchanged between people, for instance via computer-mediated communication. In this way, dialogic approaches need not be limited only to classroom-based talk or \\"external talk\\". In teaching through the opening of a shared dialogic space, dialogic education draws students into the co-construction of shared knowledge by questioning and building on dialogue rather than simply learning a set of facts. As argued by Bakhtin, children learn through persuasive dialogue rather than an authoritative transmission of facts, which enables them to understand by seeing from different points of view. Merleau-Ponty writes that when dialogue works it should no longer be possible to determine who is thinking because learners will find themselves thinking together.Merleau-Ponty, M. (1968). The Visible and the Invisible (Claude Lefort, ed. And Alphonso Lingis, trans.). Evanston, Il: Northwestern University It has been suggested by Robin Alexander that in dialogic education, teachers should frame questions carefully in order to encourage reflection and take different student‚Äôs contributions and present them as a whole. In addition, answers should be considered as leading to further questions in dialogue rather than an end goal.Alexander, R. J. (2001).

The population was 44 the last time the official state map was published. History The first townsite of Kirkland was actually in Hardeman county along a stage coach line from Wichita Falls to Mobeetie, but with the arrival of the Fort Worth & Denver City railroad in 1887, the settlement moved to its present location. At its previous location, it had \\"an inn, two saloons and a general store.\\" Settler John Quincy Adams, along whose land the FW&D; tracks were laid, platted a well-gridded townsite that soon became home to a mercantile store, a post office and a stockyard serving an ever increasing number of farmers. The panic of 1893 was a setback to Kirkland, but by 1900 growth resumed, and by 1905 Crone Webster Furr had established a mercantile store that became the beginnings of the Furr's Groceries and Cafeterias corporation. Roy Furr worked those stores as a boy, and as a man would expand the business in to an empire. By the 1920s, \\"the Biggest Little City in Texas\\" had \\"three churches, a three- room school, and several businesses, including three grocery stores, two lumber yards, two barber shops, five filling stations, three hardware stores, and a bank\\". From here, however, the decline began, and by 1980, the once- proud community had only one general store and 100 inhabitants, when previously it had 500. Today, the only significant remnants of the town are a (now dirt) street grid, a few houses and a cemetery. Kirkland Cemetery Located approximately half a mile from the Kirkland town site, the Kirkland cemetery is two long wooded savannahs of marble headstones along a dirt road, containing the last earthly remains of citizens all the way back to 1908. Why there are no burials before 1908, even though the present town site had been inhabited since the 1880s, is a mystery. 725 well-marked gravestones stand on this site, of which 45 belong to veterans, including 7 Confederate veterans of the Civil War and 22 WW2 veterans.

Traditional game theory focuses on the mathematical structure of equilibria, and tends to use basic rational choice involving utility maximization. In contrast, behavioral game theory focuses on how actual behavior tends to deviate from standard predictions: how can we explain and model those deviations, and how can we make better predictions using more accurate models? Choices studied in behavioral game theory are not always rational and do not always represent the utility maximizing choice.Camerer, C. (2003). Behavioral game theory: Experiments in strategic interaction. Princeton University Press. Behavioral game theory uses laboratory and field experiments, as well as theoretical and computational modeling. Recently, methods from machine learning have been applied in work at the intersection of economics, psychology, and computer science to improve both prediction and understanding of behavior in games.  History  Behavioral game theory began with the work of Allais in 1953 and Ellsberg in 1961. They discovered the Allais paradox and the Ellsberg paradox, respectively.Gintis, H. (2005). Behavioral game theory and contemporary economic theory. Analyse & Kritik, 27(1), 48-72. Both paradoxes show that choices made by participants in a game do not reflect the benefit they expect to receive from making those choices. In the 1970s the work of Vernon Smith showed that economic markets could be examined experimentally rather than only theoretically. At the same time, several economists conducted experiments that discovered variations of traditional decision-making models such as regret theory, prospect theory, and hyperbolic discounting. These discoveries showed that actual decision makers consider many factors when making choices. For example, a person may seek to minimize the amount of regret they will feel after making a decision and weigh their options based on the amount of regret they anticipate from each. Because they were not previously examined by traditional economic theory, factors such as regret along with many others fueled further research. Beginning in the 1980s experimenters started examining the conditions that cause divergence from rational choice. Ultimatum and bargaining games examined the effect of emotions on predictions of opponent behavior. One of the most well known examples of an ultimatum game is the television show Deal or No Deal in which participants must make decisions to sell or continue playing based on monetary ultimatums given to them by ‚Äúthe banker.‚Äù These games also explored the effect of trust on decision-making outcomes and utility maximizing behavior.Gintis, H. (2009). The bounds of reason: Game theory and the unification of the behavioral sciences. Princeton University Press. Common resource games were used to experimentally test how cooperation and social desirability affect subject's choices. A real life example of a common resource game might be a party guest's decision to take from a food platter. The guests decisions would not only be affected by how hungry they are, but they would also be affected by how much of the shared resource, the food, is left and if the guest believes others would judge them for taking more. Experimenters during this period regarded behavior that did not maximize utility as the result of participant's flawed reasoning. By the turn of the century economists and psychologists expanded this research. Models based on the rational choice theory were adapted to reflect decision maker preferences and attempt to rationalize choices that did not maximize utility.  Comparison to traditional game theory  Traditional game theory uses theoretical models to determine the most beneficial choice of all players in a game.Osborne, M. J., & Rubinstein, A. (1994). A course in game theory. MIT press. Game theory uses rational choice theory along with assumptions of players' common knowledge in order to predict utility-maximizing decisions. It also allows for players to predict their opponents' strategies.Colman, A. M. (2003). Cooperation, psychological game theory, and limitations of rationality in social interaction. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 26(02), 139-153. Traditional game theory is a primarily normative theory as it seeks to pinpoint the decision rational players should choose, but does not attempt to explain why that decision was made. Rationality is a primary assumption of game theory, so there are not explanations for different forms of rational decisions or irrational decisions. Behavioral game theory is a primarily positive theory rather than a normative theory. A positive theory seeks to describe phenomena rather than prescribe a correct action. Positive theories must be testable and can be proven true or false. A normative theory is subjective and based on opinions. Because of this, normative theories cannot be proven true or false. Behavioral game theory attempts to explain decision making using experimental data. The theory allows for rational and irrational decisions because both are examined using real-life experiments. Specifically, behavioral game theory attempts to explain factors that influence real world decisions. These factors are not explored in the area of traditional game theory, but can be postulated and observed using empirical data. Findings from behavioral game theory will tend to have higher external validity and can be better applied to real world decision-making behavior.  Examples of games used in behavioral game theory research  * Signaling game * Dictator Game * Ultimatum Game * Keynesian beauty contest * Normal form game * Cooperative game * Gift-exchange game  Factors that affect rationality in games  = Beliefs = Beliefs about other people in a decision-making game are expected to influence ones ability to make rational choices. However, beliefs of others can also cause experimental results to deviate from equilibrium, utility-maximizing decisions. In an experiment by Costa-Gomez (2008) participants were questioned about their first order beliefs about their opponent's actions prior to completing a series of normal-form games with other participants.Costa-Gomes, M. A., & Weizs√§cker, G. (2008). Stated beliefs and play in normal-form games. The Review of Economic Studies, 75(3), 729-762. Participants complied with Nash Equilibrium only 35% of the time. Further, participants only stated beliefs that their opponents would comply with traditional game theory equilibrium 15% of the time. This means participants believed their opponents would be less rational than they really were. The results of this study show that participants do not choose the utility-maximizing action and they expect their opponents to do the same. Also, the results show that participants did not choose the utility-maximizing action that corresponded to their beliefs about their opponent's action. While participants may have believed their opponent was more likely to make a certain decision, they still made decisions as if their opponent was choosing randomly. Another study that examined participants from the TV show Deal or No Deal found divergence from rational choice.Post, T., Van den Assem, M. J., Baltussen, G., & Thaler, R. H. (2008). Deal or no deal? Decision making under risk in a large-payoff game show. The American economic review, 38-71. Participants were more likely to base their decisions on previous outcomes when progressing through the game. Risk aversion decreased when participants' expectations were not met within the game. For example, a subject that experienced a string of positive outcomes was less likely to accept the deal and end the game. The same was true for a subject that experienced primarily negative outcomes early in the game. = Social cooperation = Social behavior and cooperation with other participants are two factors that are not modeled in traditional game theory, but are often seen in an experimental setting. The evolution of social norms has been neglected in decision-making models, but these norms influence the ways in which real people interact with one another and make choices. One tendency is for a person to be a strong reciprocator. This type of person enters a game with the predisposition to cooperate with other players. They will increase their cooperation levels in response to cooperation from other players and decrease their cooperation levels, even at their own expense, to punish players who do not cooperate. This is not payoff-maximizing behavior, as a strong reciprocator is willing to reduce their payoff in order to encourage cooperation from others. Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) developed a model based on reciprocity called the sequential reciprocity equilibrium. This model adapts traditional game theory logic to the idea that players reciprocate actions in order to cooperate.Dufwenberg, M., & Kirchsteiger, G. (2004). A theory of sequential reciprocity. Games and economic behavior, 47(2), 268-298. The model had been used to more accurately predict experimental outcomes of classic games such as the prisoner's dilemma and the centipede game. Rabin (1993) also created a fairness equilibrium that measures altruism's effect on choices.Rabin, M. (1993). Incorporating fairness into game theory and economics. The American economic review, 1281-1302. (Incorporates social motives into game theory decision making) He found that when a player is altruistic to another player the second player is more likely to reciprocate that altruism. This is due to the idea of fairness. Fairness equilibriums take the form of mutual maximum, where both players choose an outcome that benefits both of them the most, or mutual minimum, where both players choose an outcome that hurts both of them the most. These equilibriums are also Nash equilibriums, but they incorporate the willingness of participants to cooperate and play fair. = Incentives, consequences, and deception = The role of incentives and consequences in decision-making is interesting to behavioral game theorists because it affects rational behavior. Post (2008) analyzed Deal or no Deal contestant behavior in order to reach conclusions about decision-making when stakes are high. Studying the contestant's choices formed the conclusion that in a sequential game with high stakes decisions were based on previous outcomes rather than rationality. Players who face a succession of good outcomes, in this case they eliminate the low-value cases from play, or players who face a succession of poor outcomes become less risk averse. This means that players who are having exceptionally good or exceptionally bad outcomes are more likely to gamble and continue playing than average players. The lucky or unlucky players were willing to reject offers of over one hundred percent of the expected value of their case in order to continue playing. This shows a shift from risk avoiding behavior to risk seeking behavior. This study highlights behavioral biases that are not accounted for by traditional game theory. Riskier behavior in unlucky contestants can be attributed to the break-even effect, which states that gamblers will continue to make risky decisions in order to win back money. On the other hand, riskier behavior in lucky contestants can be explained by the house-money effect, which states that winning gamblers are more likely to make risky decisions because they perceive that they are not gambling with their own money. This analysis shows that incentives influence rational choice, especially when players make a series of decisions. Incentives and consequences also play a large role in deception in games. Gneezy (2005) studied deception using a cheap talk sender-receiver game.Gneezy, U. (2005). Deception: The role of consequences. American Economic Review, 384-394. In this type of game player one receives information about the payouts of option A and option B. Then, player one gives a recommendation to player two about which option to take. Player one can choose to deceive player two, and player two can choose to reject player one's advice. Gneezy found that participants were more sensitive to their gain from lying than to their opponent's loss. He also found that participants were not wholly selfish and cared about how much their opponents lost from their deception, but this effect diminished as their own payout increased. These findings show that decision makers examine both incentives to lie and consequences of lying in order to decide whether or not to lie. In general people are averse to lying, but given the right incentives they tend to ignore consequences. Wang (2009) also used a cheap talk game to study deception in participants with an incentive to deceive.Wang, J. T. Y., Spezio, M., & Camerer, C. (2009). Pinocchio's pupil: Using eyetracking and pupil dilation to understand truth- telling and deception in sender-receiver game. American Economic Review, Forthcoming. Using eye tracking he found that participants who received information about payoffs focused on their own payoff twice as often as their opponents. This suggests minimal strategic thinking. Further, participants' pupils dilated when they sent a deceiving, and they dilated more when telling a bigger lie. Through these physical cues Wang concluded that deception is cognitively difficult. These findings show that factors such as incentives, consequences, and deception can create irrational decisions and affect the way games unfold. = Group decisions = Behavioral game theory considers the effects of groups on rationality. In the real world many decisions are made by teams, yet traditional game theory uses an individual as a decision maker. This created a need to model group decision-making behavior. Bornstein and Yaniv (1998) examined the difference in rationality between groups and individuals in an ultimatum game.Bornstein, G., & Yaniv, I. (1998). Individual and group behavior in the ultimatum game: Are groups more ‚Äúrational‚Äù players?. Experimental Economics, 1(1), 101-108. In this game player one (or group one) decides what percentage of a payout to give to player two (or group two) and then player two decides whether to accept or reject this offer. Participants in the group condition were put in groups of three and allowed to deliberate on their decisions. Perfect rationality in this game would be player one offering player two none of the payout, but that is almost never the case in observed offers. Bornstein and Yaniv found that groups were less generous, willing to give up a smaller portion of the payoff, in the player one condition and more accepting of low offers in the player two condition than individuals. These results suggest that groups are more rational than individuals. Kocher and Sutter (2005) used a beauty contest game to study and compare individual and group behavior.Kocher, M. G., & Sutter, M. (2005). The Decision Maker Matters: Individual Versus Group Behaviour in Experimental Beauty‚ÄêContest Games*. The Economic Journal, 115(500), 200-223. A beauty contest game is one where all participants choose a number between zero and one hundred. The winner is the participant who chooses a number closest to two thirds of the average number. In the first round the rational choice would be thirty-three, as it is two thirds of the average number, fifty. Given an infinite number of rounds all participants should choose zero according to game theory. Kocher and Sutter found that groups did not perform more rationally than individuals in the first round of the game. However, groups performed more rationally than individuals in subsequent rounds. This shows that groups are able to learn the game and adapt their strategy faster than individuals.

Against the backdrop of the transformative advances in electrification.

He also served as Director of Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada from 1944 √† 1952. where Surveyer had earned his degree. In 1912, they worked on a power distribution network for the city of Grand- M√®re on Saint-Maurice River. The project that increased the company's profile was the Saint-Maurice River hydroelectric power station, which they designed and supervised. The company specialized in hydraulics, managing hydropower projects and flood control, and soon branched out into the industrial sector, particularly in pulp and paper, and mining and metallurgy. formed a first 10-year partnership with Emil Nenniger and Georges Ch√™nevert in 1937. A second partnership agreement was signed in 1946, and the firm's name was changed to , Nenniger and Ch√™nevert. The name would eventually be abbreviated to SNC. In 1967 Camille A. Dagenais , became president and CEO of SNC Group, a position he held until 1975. When Dagenais was inducted into the Order of Canada, he was honoured for his accomplishments at SNC‚Äîspecifically for large-scale hydro development projects in Canada and internationally, for example, in India and Greece. One of the most important projects was the work he oversaw on the recently nationalizedAccording to historian Paul-Andr√© Linteau, in his 1989 publication Histoire du Qu√©bec contemporain ‚Äì Volume 2: Le Qu√©bec depuis 1930, when Hydro-Qu√©bec was nationalized it became a symbol of the \\"new Quebec nationalism and of the new economic strategy of the State\\". The construction of the Daniel-Johnson Dam and the Manic-Outardes complex had a greater symbolic impact as it was part of the \\"larger social and political context of the Quiet Revolution in Quebec. Hydro-Qu√©bec's Manic-5 project (1959‚Äì1970) on the Manicouagan River, north of Baie-Comeau. It was built for hydroelectric power production and supplies water to the Manic-5s power houses. The firm's first international contract was awarded in 1963, to design and build the 780 MW Idukki power station in Kerala State, India. =Lavalin (1936‚Äì1991)= SNC's main rival in Canada was Lalonde, Valois International Limited, a company that was established in 1936 by engineers Jean-Paul Lalonde and Romeo Valois. Bernard Lamarre, who would later become director and CEO in 1962 and lead SNC for 29 years, had married Louise Lalonde, Jean-Paul Lalonde's daughter in 1952, and began working at Lalonde, Valois International Limited. In 1972, the company changed its name to Lavalin‚Äîcombining syllables from the original company name. In the 1970s, Lavalin designed and built the fabric roof for Montreal's Olympic Stadium and built the James Bay Project, in a partnership with the United-States-based Bechtel. According to a 1986 Maclean's article by Anthony Wilson-Smith, Lavalin was Canada's \\"largest engineering firm, with $625 million in operating revenues in 1985 and 5,700 employees. SNC was the second largest\\". Wilson-Smith also said that they were \\"among the largest engineering firms in the world\\". Lavalin branched out in other industries, such as cable television‚ÄîCanada's The Weather Network and M√©t√©oM√©dia were founded by Lavalin in 1988. Lavalin's shares were sold to Pelmorex in 1993. By 1990 Lavalin Inc included over 70 companies worth CA$1.2 billion. It was forced to sell to its rival SNC in 1991. Bernard Lamarre remained with the newly formed company, SNC-Lavalin until 1999. He oversaw major projects including the TransCanada highway in Montreal, the Louis- Hippolyte-Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel, the Olympic Stadium in Montr√©al, and Alcan in the Ville de La Baie. He also oversaw projects in Benin and in Algeria. Bernard Lamarre's younger brother, Jacques Lamarre, a civil engineer, became SNC-Lavalin's CEO in 1996 and left his post in 2009.

Major investors The Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec is SNC-Lavalin's \\"long-term partner\\". According to an article by Pierre Fortin in L'actualit√©, Quebec Deposit and Investment Fund (the Caisse), which manages the Quebec Pension Plan and is the second largest pension fund in Canada, after the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), has increased its financing of Quebec enterprises from 2003 through 2013. Legal issues SNC-Lavalin's management teams have been investigated in a number of allegations under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act regarding contracts beginning with the SNC-Lavalin Kerala hydroelectric dam scandal (1995‚Äì2008) through to the allegations involving the bribing of Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011. =SNC-Lavalin Kerala hydroelectric dam scandal (1995‚Äì2008)= SNC-Lavalin won a large infrastructure contract to renovate and modernize hydroelectric power stations with the Indian government in 1995 which resulted in an alleged net loss to the Indian exchequer of 3745.0 million rupees., but led to no charges against the firm. SNC was subsequently accused of bribery and financial fraud related to the contract in 2008. A government investigation resulted in the expulsion of several Indian government officials. =Montreal's Jacques- Cartier bridge (early 2000s)= According to a February 1, 2019, article in La Presse, Quebec prosecutors are cooperating with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in an investigation called Agrafe 2 on potential criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, concerning a contract in the early 2000s to repair Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge.The investigation involves former CEO Michel Fournier of the Federal Bridge Corporation who was sentenced in 2017 to five years for taking a bribe of $2.35 million in return for the \\"contract to repair the Jacques Cartier Bridge in the early 2000s\\" =Illegal reimbursement of political donations (2004‚Äì2011)= In 2016, commissioner of Canada elections was probing political party donations made by SNC-Lavalin employees. According to the source that provided information to CBC News, the investigation found that SNC-Lavalin reimbursed all of those individual donations‚Äîa practice forbidden under the Canada Elections Act‚Äîbut Elections Canada reached an agreement with the company to avoid prosecution. In May 2018, former SNC-Lavalin executive vice president Normand Morin was charged with making illegal donations to Canadian federal political parties, on recommendation from the director of public prosecutions, in the Court of Quebec. The charges allege that from 2004 to 2011, Morin orchestrated and solicited political donations from employees or their spouses to Canadian federal political parties anonymously on behalf of SNC-Lavalin, to be reimbursed afterwards. The amounts paid included about CA$110,000 to the Liberal Party and CA$8,000 to other Canadian political parties. In November 2018, Morin pleaded guilty to two of the five charges, and was fined $2,000. The remaining three charges were dropped by the prosecution. = Libya (2011) = A 2012 CBC News report, said that the first reports of murky affairs surfaced against the company in 2010 in relation to contracts in Libya. According to a CBC News article, a Libyan bribery and fraud scandal involving crimes that took place from 2001-2011 led to charges in \\"connection with payments of nearly $48 million\\" to Libyan public officials. In the same article, it was reported that the company was also accused of \\"defrauding Libyan organizations of an estimated $130 million\\". In 2015, SNC-Lavalin was charged with bribing Libyan officials in exchange for construction contracts between 2001 and 2011. In 2011, the RCMP began an investigation called Project Assistance which was triggered by a tip from Swiss authorities. According to an August 8, 2013 Financial Post article, Michael Novak who, had been the head of SNC International, had signed \\"several of the contracts between SNC and \\"unknown commercial consultants to help win contracts\\" for \\"work in Africa\\". This included a contract with former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's controversial government. By the summer of 2013, police alleged that the \\"unknown commercial consultants\\" had never existed and that Ben Aissa had \\"set up shell companies so he could pocket the [$56 million] himself\\". By July 2014, Aissa was jailed in Switzerland for \\"suspicion of corruption, fraud and money-laundering in North Africa\\".According to a CBC News report, Ben A√Øssa, was \\"known for his intimate ties to two of Gadhafi's sons\\". He \\"oversaw a SNC military-civilian engineering unit project with its first phase‚Äîa $271 million prison‚Äîcreated by SNL with the Gadhafi government that hired Edis Zagorac, Sandra McCardell's husband. McCardell was formerly Canada's ambassador to Libya. The project \\"also hired Canada's former ambassador to Tunisia, Bruno Picard.\\" According to a February 23, 2012 CBC News report, \\"SNC-Lavalin's billions of dollars worth in contracts with Libya, [were] procured by Riadh Ben A√Øssa, the executive vice president in charge of construction.\\" According to an October 1, 2014 CBC News article, A√Øssa served 29 months in prison in Switzerland before his extradition to Canada to face further charges. According to a July 10, 2018 CBC News article, Riadh Ben A√Øssa \\"pleaded guilty to one charge of using a forged document at the Montreal courthouse\\". In \\"exchange for the plea, 15 other charges against him were dropped.\\" When SNC- Lavalin pulled out of Libya in 2011, it left behind $22.9 million in Libyan banks. In 2013, Roy filed a countersuit for wrongful dismissal, claiming lost wages and damages to his reputation, alleging that he had been framed and scapegoated by higher-level executives whose directives he was obliged to follow.By February 13, 2013, St√©phane Roy, \\"a former SNC controller filed a lawsuit against SNC for \\"wrongful dismissal claiming he was only following SNC‚Äôs \\"corporate culture.\\" In 2014 he was charged with \\"fraud, bribing a foreign official and violating United Nations sanctions against Libya in connection with SNC-Lavalin‚Äôs operations in that country.\\"] In February 2019, sixty months after the original charges were made, Judge Patricia Compagnone, ruled that based on the Jordan ruling, Roy's right to a speedy trial had been violated and she therefore acquitted him of all charges. By February 2012, SNC investors had found out that audited financial statements had been delayed to accommodate an internal review relating to SNC's operations. The internal review probed $35 million of unexplained payments in Libya. Prior to the launch of the investigation, there had been months-long media speculation about the company's work in Libya and its ties to the Muammar Gaddafi family. In 2012, the RCMP investigated the company on these charges in the Project Assistance investigation and, in 2015, they charged SNC-Lavalin with \\"fraud and corruption\\", which the company indicated they would contest in court. On December 18, 2019, SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. pleaded guilty to fraud contrary to section 380(1) a) of the Canadian Criminal Code. The company stated that, between 2001 and 2011, over $47.5 million had been paid to Al- Saadi Gaddafi. The money was directed through two representative companies, both listing Riadh Ben Aissa as the sole beneficial owner. In return for the bribes, Al-Saadi Gaddafi applied his influence to the construction contract bidding process, ensuring contracts were awarded to SNC-Lavalin Construction. Payments of personal benefits totalling over $73.5 million were also made through the representative companies to Ben Aissa and Sami Bebawi, a former vice-president of SLCI. As part of its plea agreement with the Public Prosecution Service, SLCI was fined $280 million and given a three-year probation order. In exchange, the remaining corruption and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. and SNC-Lavalin International Inc. were stayed. = McGill University; the Arthur Porter kick- back scandal (2011‚Äì2014) = Charges were laid against senior executives from 2014 through 2019 in the bribery cases involving Arthur Porter at the McGill University Health Centre. According to a 2012 article in The Globe and Mail, these reports prompted calls for Canada to tighten bribery laws. According to the National Post, SNC-Lavalin employees allegedly were involved in fraud and forgery in relation to a $22.5 million kick-back described as \\"consulting fees\\" to Arthur PorterAccording to a February 1, 2019 CTV News article, Yanai Elbaz, a former MUHC senior manager, was Arthur Porter's \\"right-hand man in regards to the \\"$22.5-million in bribes. According to a June 26, 2013 article in The Star, in the spring of 2013, an audit of SNC-Lavalin's European headquarters in France uncovered a $13.5-million payment that was made to look like it was tied to a Middle East gas-plant project\\" but it was actually paid to a company run by the Porter. In 2013, SNC-Lavalin said that the $13.5M was a portion of the $56 million in improper payments that led to the dismissal in 2012 of former CEO Pierre Duhaime and Riadh Ben Aissa, then executive vice- president of construction. on the contract to build the new $1.3 billion hospital at the McGill University Health Centre's CEO in violation of the Quebec Health Act. SNC-Lavalin were awarded the contract even though they were outbid by $60 million. The case led to an investigation by the Charbonneau Commission. Porter resigned from the post on December 5, 2011 in light of substantial public pressure. Porter was arrested in Panama on fraud charges on May 27, 2013, which alleged that he took part in the kick-back scheme. The CBC called it the biggest fraud investigation in Canadian history. SNC CEO, Pierre Duhaime in March 2012, Duhaime was arrested on fraud charges by Quebec authorities on November 28, 2012.Former SNC-Lavalin CEO Pierre Duhaime resigned in the last week of March 2012 with $4.97-million in various departure payments according to an April 3, 2012 Financial Post article. He was arrested by Quebec authorities on November 28, 2012. According to a February 1, 2019 CTV News article by Pierre Saint-Arnaud, in February 2019, Duhaime pleaded guilty to a single charge in connection with the major corruption and fraud case involving SNC-Lavalin's contract to construct a new $1.3-billion hospital at the University Health Centre. He was the last defendant in the case. He faced \\"16 charges including fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, using forged documents and breach of trust.\\"According to a CBC article, in another case stemming from this Project Assistance investigation, Quebec Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer stayed obstruction of justice charges against former SNC-Lavalin vice-president Sami Bebawi and his lawyer Constantine Kyres, on February 15 citing unreasonable delays. Kyres was originally arrested in January 2014. In 2018, a judge ruled that the RCMP had illegally obtained evidence in this case. Bebawi still faces \\"several other charges related to contracts negotiated with Moammar Gadhafi's Libyan regime.\\" SNC-Lavalin sued Duhaime for millions of dollars in damages, claiming that he stained its goodwill by means of the McGill University Health Centre superhospital scandal. The company claims that Duhaime \\"facilitated the execution of the embezzlement\\" of $22.5 million of company funds. Duhaime was charged with several counts related to the bribe. In February 2019 he pleaded guilty to one count of breach of trust. The prosecution vacated some 15 further charges.https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muhc- superhospital-snc-lavalin-sues-former-ceo-for-millions = Padma Bridge (since 2011) = An investigation into an alleged graft related to 2011 bids for the construction of the 6.51 kilometre (four-mile) USD$3 billion road‚Äîrail bridge crossing the Padma River in Bangladesh, resulted in the former SNC-Lavalin employees being cleared of all charges by a Canadian court. In May 2011, two former SNC-Lavalin International Inc. (SLII) employees Ramesh Shah and Mohammad Ismail met government officials in Bangladesh to discuss a bid for the $50-million supervision contract to build the Padma Bridge, a project estimated to be worth US$3 billion. Part of the allegations were related to SLII common practice of list project consultancy costs (PCC), also known as project commercial cost, as a line item in internal budgets documents related to the bidding process.According to a May 15, 2013 CBC News report, SNC- Lavalin International Inc. (SLII) \\"focused on smaller contracts to design and supervise megaprojects\\". According to former SLII engineer, Mohammad Ismail, it was a common practice for SLII to list project consultancy costs (PCC) also known as project commercial cost, as a line item in internal budgets documents in regards to contracts with countries such as, including Kazakhstan, Cambodia (2013), Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Ghana, to facilitate bids on contracts. These PCCs or CCs were flagged in audits as potential bribes. As a result of the original investigation by World Bank investigators who worked with RCMP officers, in September 2013, the World Bank blacklisted SNC-Lavalin and its affiliates from bidding on the World Bank's global projects. The World Bank had originally offered to fund $1.5 billion of the $3 billion but pulled back following the allegations. However, on February 11, 2017, the Ontario Superior Court found no proof of the Padma bridge bribery conspiracy, dismissed the case, and acquitted the ex-SNC-Lavalin executives. According to the Dhaka Tribune, Justice Ian Nordheimer rebuked the Canadian police, saying: \\"Reduced to its essentials, the information provided in the [wiretap applications] was nothing more than speculation, gossip, and rumor.\\" = SaskPower serious design flaws (2015) = In 2015, internal documents from SaskPower (the crown corporation that is the principal electric utility in Saskatchewan, Canada), revealed that there were \\"serious design issues\\" in the carbon capture and storage system at its coal-fired Boundary Dam Power Station, resulting in regular breakdowns and maintenance problems that caused the unit to be operational only 40% of the time. SNC-Lavalin had been contracted to engineer, procure, and build the facility, and the documents asserted that it \\"has neither the will or the ability to fix some of these fundamental flaws\\". The low productivity of the plant had in turn meant that SaskPower was only able to sell half of the 800,000 tonnes of captured carbon dioxide that it had contracted to sell to Cenovus Energy for use in enhanced oil recovery at a cost of $25 per tonne. In addition to the lost sales, this meant that SaskPower had been forced to pay Cenovus $12 million in penalties. In 2017, Cenovus sold its Saskatchewan operations to Whitecap Resources. By September 2018, \\"SaskPower and SNC-Lavalin had completed mediation and were headed to binding arbitration\\". In July 2018, SaskPower announced, in its annual report, that that would not be proceeding with retrofitting the two aging facilities near Estevan‚ÄîBoundary Dams 4 and 5 (BD4 and BD5) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). According to a February 11, 2019 CBC News article, SNC-Lavalin has \\"received about $765,800,000 in [Saskatchewan provincial] government contracts from 2009 to 2018\\". = SNC-Lavalin affair (2019)= Following a 2017 public consultation process, the Government of Canada moved forward with the establishment of a \\"made-in-Canada version of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) regime\\", called the \\"Remediation Agreement Regime\\", which was introduced in the March budget and came into effect in June 2018.The Government of Canada held a consultation period in 2017 regarding the implementation of a deferred prosecution agreement similar to one used in the United Kingdom. The report of the consultation showed that the majority approved of a DPA. SNC-Lavalin's lawyers began a process to request a DPA in April, 2018, one of the first companies to do so. The government enhanced the 2015 Integrity Regime with the addition of a made-in-Canada deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) called a \\"Remediation Agreement Regime\\" which was enacted in June 2018 through provisions in the omnibus budget implementation Bill C-74, that amended the Criminal Code. By 2019, SNC-Lavalin, still facing criminal charges in regard to several contracts, began investigating the possibility of a DPA under the newly introduced Remediation Agreement Regime, as early as April 2018. On February 10, 2019, the Toronto Star reported that Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer met with SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce on May 29, 2018 to discuss the remediation agreement. The director of public prosecutions informed SNC-Lavalin on October 9, that its DPA option was rejected because \\"is not appropriate in this case\\". According to the National Post, \\"If the company is convicted it would be barred from bidding on federal contracts for 10 years, potentially costing it billions in forgone revenue.\\" In response, the company's share prices dropped, leaving it vulnerable to a hostile takeover. According to the Montreal Gazette, Quebec Premier Fran√ßois Legault said that SNC-Lavalin was one of ten publicly-traded companies headquartered in Quebec that the province considers to be \\"strategic\\" and therefore in need of protection from a takeover that would force the company to leave the province. On February 8, 2019, The Globe and Mail reported that sources close to the government said that the Prime Minister's Office allegedly had attempted to influence Jody Wilson-Raybould's decision concerning SNC- Lavalin's request for a DPA, while she was Minister of Justice and Attorney General. When asked about the allegations, Justin Trudeau said that the story in the Globe was false and that he had never \\"directed\\" Wilson-Raybould concerning the case. Wilson-Raybould refused to comment on the matter citing solicitor-client privilege. Under pressure from the Conservative Party of Canada and the New Democratic Party (NDP), on February 11, 2019, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner launched an inquiry into allegations of political interference and a possible violation of the Conflict of Interest Act in the SNC-Lavalin case. On February 18, 2019, Gerald Butts, Trudeau's principal secretary, resigned and denied that he or anyone else in the Prime Minister's Office attempted to influence Wilson-Raybould. On February 27, 2019, Wilson-Raybould spoke about the SNC-Lavalin controversy at a hearing of the House of Commons justice committee. In her first substantial public statement on the matter, she testified that she was inappropriately pressured to prevent the Montreal-based company from being prosecuted in a bribery case. On 14 August 2019, Mario Dion, conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, released a report that said Trudeau contravened section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould. The report details lobbying efforts by SNC-Lavalin to influence prosecution since at least February 2016, including the lobbying efforts to enact DPA legislation. The report analyses SNC-Lavalin's interests and finds that the lobbying effort advanced private interests of the company, rather than public interests. The report's analysis section discusses the topics of prosecutorial independence and Shawcross doctrine (dual role of Attorney General) to draw the conclusion that the influence was improper and a violation of Conflict of Interest Act. = Company responses = SNC-Lavalin CEO Pierre Duhaime resigned in March 2012 and was arrested by Quebec's anti-corruption squad on charges including fraud on November 28, 2012. He was replaced by Ian A. Bourne, who was also the chairman of Ballard Power Systems and a member of the CPP Investment Board. Bourne sat on SNC-Lavalin's board of directors beginning in 2009, before the \\"allegations of fraud and corruption in Libya\\" were made. As interim CEO from May 2012 to October 2012, Bourne oversaw a \\"major overhaul\\" of SNC-Lavalin's culture. Bourne resigned as chairman and as a director in March 2015 and was replaced by Lawrence N. Stevenson, who sat on SNC's board from 1999 until 2018. Just before retiring from SNC-Lavalin in May 2012, Gwyn Morgan‚Äîwho had been chair since 2006‚Äîhired American civil and environmental engineer Robert Card as CEO. Card was instructed to revamp the company's \\"ethics and compliance standards\\" and oversee the departure of existing management that had been involved in the scandals. During this period, about 10,000 Canadian employees left the company, many of them voluntarily. By 2013, when Card had completed his \\"strategic offensive\\" against previous SNC-Lavalin management, Neil Bruce, a native of Scotland, replaced Card. By August, four senior executives had departed, including Gilles Laram√©e, former CFO, Ric Sorbo, former head of SNC's oil and gas business, Patrick Lamarre, head of the power unit, and Michael Novak. SNC also dismissed financial controller St√©phane Roy. Bruce undertook a campaign to improve ethics and compliance at all levels of the company management. This included using Transparency International's corruption rankings as a guideline in deciding which countries with which SNC- Lavalin would do business. In June 2019 Bruce retired from the company. In 2019, the investigations continued to affect the company and its CEO Bruce. SNC-Lavalin continued to face criminal charges in 2019 in regards to alleged bribes contracts between 2001 and 2011. The company failed to receive a remediation agreement that would have provided a reprieve from criminal charges and now faces a potential conviction. A new investigation involving potential bribery in relation to a repair contract in the early 2000s, has been reported by La Presse.

Function  microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem- loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

Function  microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem- loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop.

The younger brother invariably used the name Alfred Sinclair. History Wadham and Sinclair were sons of Benjamin Brassett (or Braffat) Wadham (1816‚Äì1904), a painter of some note who was deaf and dumb from birth. Joseph learnt to paint at his father's side, and accompanied him on his many sketching trips throughout England and Wales, and had the privilege of seeing many of England's premier artists at work. Joseph had his first picture accepted for exhibition by the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, at age 14. In 1885 he left for Australia. Alfred studied at the Liverpool Academy of Arts and left for Melbourne, Australia, in 1887, to join his brother, who had made the journey a year earlier. After a brief stay they moved to Adelaide, and joined the South Australian Society of Arts. They had exhibitions in Melbourne in 1889 and 1895, which were favourably and extensively reviewed. They set up a gallery \\"Wadham & Sinclair's Fine Art Institute\\" on Grenfell Street where they showed their works and ran art classes. They made an extended visit to Mount Gambier in mid-1888. In 1891 they moved their studio to Mutual Chambers, King William Street, and had several art classes running. In 1892 they were elected to the Adelaide Art Circle, whose president was H. P. Gill, and the South Australian Society of Arts, but were among those (like G. A. Reynolds and A. Scott Broad) who later in the year resigned to form the Adelaide Easel Club, with Joseph its first president. They had a sketching holiday in New Zealand in 1896, and on their return moved their studio to new premises in the Widows Funds Building, Grenfell Street. Joseph Wadham took an exhibition to Perth in 1896 and 1897, touring the goldfields and making further sketches. A major exhibition in 1897, opened by the Governor, featured several paintings of Kalggorli and Perth; among the works shown was a joint effort ‚Äì Precipice Gorge, New Zealand, painted in oils. Shortly after this exhibition, Alfred returned to England. Joseph stayed longer in Australia, married and had several children, but he had great ambitions, and made several trips to South Africa, Canada and New Zealand painting, exhibiting and organising exhibitors for an exhibition of Dominion art in 1897, which was attended by the Prince of Wales, and 1898. He helped found the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists, which had a successful exhibition in 1902. In the early 1920s Wadham opened the Wadham Art Gallery in Sydney, which carried works by a large number of artists, the best-known being Sir John Millais, as well as himself. This reference mentions a grandfather, Sir William Wadham, painter and collector. He sold up and returned to England in 1923.

The portrait's subject has not been securely identified, but she may be Susanna Lunden, n√©e Fourment (1599‚Äì1628), the older sister of Rubens' future second wife Helena Fourment.

Risk factors  Before corneal refractive surgery such as LASIK, SMILE, and PRK, people must be examined for possible risk factors such as keratoconus. Abnormal corneal topography compromises of keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or forme fruste keratoconus with an I-S value of 1.4 or more is the most significant risk factor. Low age, low residual stromal bed (RSB) thickness, low preoperative corneal thickness, and high myopia are other important risk factors.  Treatments  Treatment options include contact lenses, intrastromal corneal ring segments, custom topography- guided transepithelial PRK combined with corneal collagen cross-linking, or corneal transplant. When cross-linking is performed only after the cornea becomes distorted, vision remains blurry even though the disease is stabilised. As a result, combining corneal collagen cross-linking with LASIK ('LASIK Xtra') aims to strengthen the cornea at the point of surgery and may be useful in cases where a very thin cornea is expected after the LASIK procedure. This would include cases of high spectacle power and people with thin corneas before surgery. Definitive evidence that the procedure can reduce the risk of corneal ectasia will only become available a number of years later as corneal ectasia, if it happens, usually occurs in the late post-operative period. Some study show that combining LASIK with cross-linking adds refractive stability to hyperopic treatments and may also do the same for very high myopic treatments. In 2016, the FDA approved the KXL system and two photoenhancers for the treatment of corneal ectasia following refractive surgery.

The railway station was opened by the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) on its Moray Firth coast line in 1886, served by Aberdeen to Elgin trains. The station closed to regular passenger traffic on 1 October 1951, more than a decade before the total closure of the line itself in 1968. In 1923 the GNoSR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway and at nationalisation in 1948 became part of British Railways. The line itself was later recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. History =Background= In 1881 the Great North of Scotland Railway put a bill to parliament to extend its Portsoy line along the Moray Firth as far as Buckie. In 1882 the Great North of Scotland applied for permission to build a line from Portsoy following the coast to Buckie and then running on to Elgin. =Great North of Scotland Railway= The GNoSR station opened as 'Tochieneal' on 1 April 1884 with the central section of the coast line, served by through Aberdeen to Elgin trains. In 1923 the Great North of Scotland Railway was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway.

He was the Regimentschef of the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment, Commandant of the Royal Residence in Berlin, Gouverneur militaire of Berlin, a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle a member of King Frederick I of Prussia's \\"Tobacco Collegium\\".Wassermann, Pages 172-173 (in German) and president of the Grand Directoire 1718‚Äì1729, the deliberative and decision- making body responsible for all Huguenot affairs in the kingdom. Although there are references to Jean de Forcade de Biaix as the \\"Marquis de Biaix\\" in some Prussian sources published between 1788 and 1837, there is no evidence that he was ever a Marquis. The noble manor of Biaix in the city of Pau was never a marquisate, at any time in its history. He was also never the Seigneur de Biaix, as stated in some historical Prussian sources. The title Seigneur was not hereditary. In the case of his family, his father, who purchased Biaix manor in 1659, was the Seigneur de Biaix. Following the father's death in 1684, the property and the right to enter the Order of Nobility of the Estates of B√©arn were passed to the eldest son, Jean's elder brother, Isaac de Forcade de BiaixPicamihl, Tome 1, Page 421 (in French) (Seigneur de Biaix 1684‚Äì1737).  Life in France  Little is known about his early life. His parents were Protestant. Protestant church records do not exist for the period between 1617 and 1667 for the Temple in Pau. Historical records published in the 19th century related to the research of noble families in France claim that only two branchesChaix d'Est-Ange, Tome 18, Page 316 (in French) of this family descended from the parents, and that the only surviving branch was the Prussian one.Chaix d'Est-Ange, Tome 18, Page 315 (in French)O'Gilvy, Tome 3, Page 173 (in French) Protestant baptismal records for the Temple in Pau for the period 1668‚Äì1681Pau, Culte r√©form√© - Registre GG6 (in French) and 1673‚Äì1684,Pau, Culte r√©form√© - Registre GG8 (in French) however, point to a large family with no fewer than 11 children, of which six sons to carry the name forward. What happened to the rest of the family is unknown.  Emigration to Prussia  Jean de Forcade de Biaix, unlike his father and eldest brother, did not abjure from Protestantism. Like many Huguenots, he left B√©arn in religious exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by the Edict of Fontainebleau in October 1685 and went to Brandenburg, where Frederick I of Prussia, the Elector of Brandenburg, was actively encouraging Huguenot immigration. Frederick I of Prussia, Elector of Brandenburg and future King of Prussia, saw an immediate interest in what Huguenot Refugees could represent for his country. Indeed, he was both a francophile and an admirer of the French. In October 1685, he published the Edict of Potsdam granting the Huguenots everything the Edict of Fontainebleau refused them: safe passage to Brandenburg, freedom to live and work where they chose, religious freedom and the right to worship in their native French, tax exemptions for 10 years, and more, going as far as granting them the same rights as citizens of the states of Brandenburg-Prussia. Meanwhile, his envoy to King Louis XIV of France's court at Versailles, the Count of Schwerin, dispensed subsidies and passports to all who requested them, provided, of course, that those requesting appeared to be of some benefit to his sovereign. As a result, the Kingdom of Prussia became for many Huguenots, in particular for the noblesse militaire, the ideal place of refuge,Pierre Danty, 1978, Page 269 (in French) for Jean de Forcade de Biaix. Whereas there were only about 400 Huguenots in the Kingdom of Prussia in 1685, two years later, 20,000 French had established themselves. ¬∑Berlin and Frankfurt on the Oder, the Kingdom of Prussia's two major cities, who each had 7,000 inhabitants in 1685, almost doubled in size within five years as a result of the French contribution and thanks to Frederick I of Prussia's generous offer of land and houses to the religious exiles. Huguenot Noblemen and officers flocked to the military, where letters patent granted them the same rank they previously held in France, with the youngest among them granted entry ranks as ensigns or lieutenants, while in parallel new roles were created for notaries public, members of the bar and members of parliament, and lastly, businessmen and tradesmen were offered significant opportunities to start new industrial activities.  Life in Prussia  By October 1686, Jean de Forcade de Biaix began a military career that would span 41 years, raise him to the highest military rank in the Prussian Army, lead him into posts in the civil administration of Prussia, and have him placed by Frederick William I of Prussia at the head of administration and decision-making for all Huguenot colonies in the kingdom from 1718 until his death in 1729. * In October 1686, lieutenant in the Elector of Brandenburg's militia in Frankfurt (Oder).Pierre Danty, 1978, Page 270 (in French) * 1688, captain in the Elector's Bodyguards in Frankfurt (Oder). * 1692, captain in the Prussian Guard in Crossen (Oder). * 1699, captain in the Elector's Bodyguards in Berlin.B√©ringuier, Page 11 (in German and French) He remained in the rank of captain for nearly fifteen years, humbly performing his occupation as a soldier. But two events enabled him to rise out of subordinate functions. In 1697, he married the Baroness Juliane von Honstedt from an old W√ºrttembergian family, who also had the advantage of being the daughter of a major general in the service of Prussia. At the same time, the Electors of Brandenburg become the Kings of Prussia in 1701, and Frederick William I of Prussia, the future King of Prussia, befriended him. Jean de Forcade de Biaix pleased him and his career began to show it. Frederick William I of Prussia, known as the \\"Soldier King\\", who would later become the organizer of the Prussian Army, particularly appreciated three things: tobacco (Potsdam's Tabagies became famous); soldiers, especially if they were very tall; and lastly, thrift (he was known for a selfish greed). Concerning this latter, he especially appreciated French Huguenots, and is said to have admiringly exclaimed: \\"These are the only French who are satisfied with a single frog per day!\\"Pierre Danty, 1978, Page 271 (in French) He found all three qualities Jean de Forcade de Biaix. * On 12 September 1702, promoted to major in the Prussian White Fusilier Guards (later the 1st Prussian Infantry Regiment). * Promoted on 12 August 1705 to lieutenant colonel. * 1711, promoted to colonel. * 1713, a colonel in General Field Marshall Count von Wartensleben's Infantry Regiment, renamed that year to the 1st Prussian Infantry Regiment,Lange, Page 91 (in German) appointed as Gouverneur militaire of Berlin, aka Commandant of Berlin. In this latter position, he reigned over his garrison with discipline and gained a reputation as one of the most severe military governors of Berlin. He is thought to be the founder of the famous \\"Prussian Drill\\" that would become the admiration of numerous generations of military to follow. Each night during the fifteen years of his governorship, he would send a letter to King Frederick William I of Prussia in which he recounted in detail the events of the day, allegedly without ever forgetting a single one. * In February 1716, as a colonel, given the command of the 23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment, then garrisoned in Berlin Tabakskollegium Frederick I. of Prussia, circ 1710 Jean de Forcade de Biaix was an avid and active member of the Tobacco Collegium (), the aeropagus before which, at the Royal Court in Berlin, the affairs of domestic and foreign policy were discussed. Smoking was mandatory. The smoking lounge () was set up based on the Dutch model, like a Great Hall. Every evening at six o'clock the Tobacco Collegium came together and remained until ten o'clock or longer. Other members included: Friedrich Wilhelm von Grumbkow, Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, affectionately referred to as \\"the old Dessauer\\", Count Alexander von D√∂nhoff, Colonel von Derschau, the Generals von Gerstorf and von Sydow, General Peter von Blankensee, affectionately called \\"Blitzpeter\\" at court, Caspar Otto von Glasenapp, Christoph Adam von Flanz, Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer, Heinrich Karl von der Marwitz, Friedrich Wilhelm von Rochow, Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, Arnold Christoph von Waldow, Johann Christoph Friedrich von Haake and the occasional invited minister and ambassador, on a case-by-case basis. Following the death of Lieutenant General Count Otto Magnus von D√∂nhoff on 14 December 1717, who had hitherto been the Prussian minister responsible for all Huguenot colonies in Prussia, Frederick William I, then just five years into his reign, assembled the French in Berlin and gave them the freedom to choose from his ministers the one in whom they had the greatest confidence as his replacement.Mauvillon (1756), pp. 200‚Äì204 (in French) This was accepted with great joy, but at the same time (3 January 1718), the King asked that whoever the colony chose as the new minister be considered as the most appropriate choice. To ensure the choice was appropriate, he handed the matter over to the then Commandant of Berlin, Colonel von Forcade, who historians recounting the event described as \\"‚Ä¶a brave soldier, but scientifically speaking, quite uneducated.\\"Stenzel (1841), Band 3, Buch VI, 2nd Subchapter, p. 404 (in German)Fa√ümann I - S . 206 Despite his educational handicap, Colonel von Forcade has been called \\"one of the most important figures in the reformed emigration,\\"Savine (1909), p. 48 (in French) and he enjoyed the full confidence of King Frederick William I. Following the death Count von D√∂nhoff, it was in von Forcade's house in Berlin on 3 January 1718 that the petition from the representatives of the colony to the King was written and signed to thank him for having left the choice of a new protector to them. > \\"‚Ä¶We are persuaded, there is not one of your Majesty's Ministers, who is not > equally disposed to treat us with the same Goodness, the late Count Denhoff > (sic) used to have for us ; however, SIRE, if one of them must absolutely be > chosen, who can do it better than your Majesty, whose Penetration nothing > escapes, and who has condescended to show such an Attention, to every Thing, > which is for our good, and for our Advantage?

Frederick William I had implanted numerous Huguenot colonies in Lithuania, but refused to provide them with the requested French-speaking pastors, instead placing them under the Consistorium of the German Reformed Church and ensuring that they received pastors who were perfectly bilingual French-German.Historische Nachricht von der Stiftung der franz√∂sischen Colonicn bei Gelegenheit des hundertj√§hrigen Jubil√§ums v . 29 .

S . 50 On 9 March 1719, the King founded a new quorum named the Grand Directoire aka Conseil fran√ßois (sic) in Berlin under the presidency of General von Forcade, [wrong reference] which would have the responsibility of representing the best interests of the Huguenot colonies. This would entail filling vacant positions, distributing aid to the needy, and supporting commerce and manufacturing. In addition to appointing General von Forcade as president, he appointed members of the Huguenot colony from the ranks of the military and the civil service, his Royal Court, the Council of Commerce, as well as two pastors. This new deliberative assembly represented therewith all affairs and matters of the Huguenot colonies in the kingdom.Historische Nachricht S . 41 ffFa√ümann l . S . 257 On 29 February 1720, with General von Forcade at the head of all Huguenot affairs in the kingdom, to the benefit of all Huguenot refugees, Frederick William I renewed the edicts and declarations, privileges, liberties, and advantages enacted by his predecessors, and determined that all Frenchmen who left their fatherland for religious reasons would benefit from the advantages of the Naturalization Edict of 13 May 1709 and other advantages granted earlier, in particular the 15-year exemption from all charges and taxes (with the exception of excise), and decreed that all Huguenots would fall under the jurisdiction of French courts established in the kingdom.Stenzel (1841), Band 3, Buch VI, 2nd Subchapter, pp. 404‚Äì405 (in German) * During 1721, because of the increasing size of the Berlin garrison, which was increased to four regiments of infantry and one battalion of artillery, a special commission and treasury were established to examine the manner the new troops were being provided for. At the head of this commission was General von Forcade, then Commandant of Berlin, who was described as \\"‚Ä¶a very brave soldier, who knew nothing of the whole thing, spoke only very broken German, and could scarcely write his name‚Ä¶\\".Stenzel (1841), Band 3, Buch VI, 2nd Subchapter, p. 378 (in German) The newly reorganized Huguenot colonies under the Grand Directoire and General von Forcade received these edicts with tremendous gratitude and reassurance, and found effective protection from the King against the often violent levies that government officials from time-to-time attempted to impose.K√∂nig l .

He increased the retirement pensions of the colony's clergy to 15,000 Thalers, founded two new colonies in Stettin (1721) and in Potsdam (1723), and showered them abundantly special privileges. The Grand Directoire under General von Forcade facilitated construction projects such as the Klosterkirche (1726), the Luisenstadtkirche (1727), and the Hospitalkirche in Berlin, as well as the French reformed churches in K√∂nigsberg and Frankfurt an der Oder.Stenzel (1841), Band 3, Buch VI, 2nd Subchapter, p. 405 (in German) Frederick William I emphatically preserved the colony's privileges, even in their disputes with provincial authorities, in particular those concerning the use of the French language, thereby continually attracting newcomers to the colonies, especially in Berlin and other notable cities, acquiring large numbers of competent officials for his administrations.Historische Nachricht S . 44 ff * 8 September 1721, as the president of the Grand Directoire, Jean de Forcade de Biaix laid the cornerstone of the new French church, the Klosterkirche, in the Klosterstrasse.Luisenstadt-Berlin Calendar, September (in German) * 1722, appointed as Commandant of the Royal Residence in Berlin (earlier, in 1714, according to some sources.)Sch√∂ning and Sch√∂nning (1830), p. 198 (in German)Sch√∂ning and Sch√∂nning (1830), p. 200 (in German) * 24 February 1727,Quartier-la-Tente (1903), p. 21 (in French) General de Forcade, Major General in the armies of His Majesty, Commandant in Berlin, was admitted as a citizen () by a letter from the Council of State () of the Canton of Neuch√¢tel sent to him on this date.

A Count's coronet to demonstrate rank and because the family originally served the counts of Foix and B√©arn during the English Wars in the Middle Ages. =Parents= Jean de Forcade de Biaix's parents are erroneously cited in various Prussian historical sources between 1767 and 1861 as the French Field MarshallDienemann, Nachrichten vom Johanniterorden, Page 360 (in German) Jaques de Forcade,Kneschke, Band 3, Page 293 (in German) Seigneur de Biaix and Philippine d'Espalungue, Baronne d'Arros. Whether this information was intentionally provided false, or unintentionally in error, is a matter of pure speculation. These same sources state that the family origins were in Spain before B√©arn, most likely referring to what had been the Kingdom of Navarre, which was split between the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain, with the part south of the Pyr√©n√©es becoming a part of Spain in 1521, and the part north of the Pyr√©n√©es becoming the Kingdom of Navarre-B√©arn, before becoming a part of France in 1589, when King Henry III of Navarre inherited the French throne as Henry IV of France. In 1620 it was merged into the France.

Jean de Forcade de Biaix was said to have also maintained a mistress at the royal court by the name of Mademoiselle la LettiPrussia (1845), p. 56 (in French) a Governess to Friederike Sophie Wilhelmine of Prussia, that he apparently shared with Philippe Forneret, an elder of the French Temple in Luisenstaft (), then pastor of the French Temple in Berlin-Friedrichstadt, and later a Conseiller to the King in his Consistoire Sup√©rieur. La Letti was the daughter of an Italian monk who had run away from his monastery and settled in Holland.Prussia (1845), p. 7 (in French) She was infamous for having beaten Friederike Sophie Wilhelmine of Prussia throughout her youth, until she was finally discovered and dismissed. =Children= Two sons and three daughters are known to have been born out of this marriage. Three of the children were born before 31 December 1699. The second eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix, covered the name de Forcade de Biaix with glory. * Friedrich Wilhelm de Forcade de Biaix, aka Frideric Guillaume de Forcade, King Frederick I of Prussia's Godson, (* ,Berlin-Friedrichstadt, Vol. Baptisms 1673-1704, Page p. 392 (in French manuscript) Berlin, Brandenburg; ‚Ä† ,Berlin Garrison Parish, Deaths 1735, p. 774 (in German manuscript) Berlin, Brandenburg), as the Captain de Forcade.

Titles and offices  Historical terms, in particular those related to offices, titles and awards, are often outdated in their usage to the point that modern dictionaries no longer contain them. To understand their meaning in the present day context it is necessary to look into dictionaries from the period. Historical terms in German used in the production of this article, and their English definitions, include: =Regimentschef= The appointment to Regimentschef, a Regimental Commander in the Prussian Army, was usually for life. For this reason, most regiments were known and referred to by the name of their Chef, the commander; for example, \\"Forcade's Regiment\\", instead of the \\"23rd Prussian Infantry Regiment\\".  Biaix - The Family Manor  The noble manor of Biaix (see also Manorialism) in the city of Pau and another house called Biaix du faubourg located in what was the suburbs of the early 16th century city, were simultaneously ennobled on 20 September 1521, by letters patent of Henry II, King of Navarre, for Pierre de Biaix, at the time chancellor of Foix and B√©arn. Noble Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Rontignon, purchased both properties on 28 February 1659Archives D√©partementales des Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, Jean d'Agoeix, E2048 from Gratian von Turon, Seigneur de Beyrie, for 6,000 Bordeaux livres and was admitted on 10 June 1659 to the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn as Seigneur de Biaix. The property was not a fief in the classical sense, because it was not a large plot of land, with all the buildings on it and the people who lived there as serfs, and as such did not required the collection of taxes, the exercise of punishment, and other related rights and obligations. Under intimidation from the policy of harassment of religious minorities through the use of dragonnades, started in 1681, to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism or to leave France, and under the threat of confiscation of properties of nobles who did not convert, both Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix and his eldest son abjured from Protestantism, therewith maintaining possession of Biaix. Following the father's death in 1684, the property and the right to enter the Order of Nobility of the Estates of B√©arn were passed to the eldest son, Isaac de Forcade de Biaix (Seigneur de Biaix 1684‚Äì1737). In turn, following his death in 1737, the property and the right to enter the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn were passed to his eldest son, Jean-Jacob de Forcade de Biaix, (Seigneur de Biaix 1738‚Äì?), before the noble Forcade-Biaix line in France extinguished. Although the noble line extinguished, the branches of the family continued at least well into the beginning of the 20th century, if not longer. Following vicissitudes of fortune, the house in the outskirts of Pau, Biaix du faubourg, was acquired from the de Casaus family on 10 May 1710 by No√© Dufau, merchant furbisher, who was received in the Order of Nobility of the States of B√©arn on 28 April 1717 as Seigneur de Biaix du faubourg. No√© Dufau died in 1739 and bequeathed it back to his niece and Goddaughter, Jean-Jacob de Forcade de Biaix's daughter, Marie-Jeanne de Forcade, Dame de Biaix, who later married Pierre de Casamajor. Because Biaix was acquired in 1659, any reference to earlier generations of the Forcade family line with \\"de Biaix\\" as a part of their name, as observed in older Prussian sources, are erroroneous.

He became known as the one of the best landscape artists from Guatemala, and was part of a generation of prolific artists who, as exponents of national art, defined the Guatemalan School. √Ålvarez developed a distinguished wide impasto technique, using the spatula, and a great delicacy in the use of color.  Early career  √Ålvarez had exhibited his works in domestic and international solo and group exhibitions, but notably in Guatemala at the Instituto Guatemalteco Americano (IGA), the National School of Fine Arts, la Fundaci√≥n Arte Paiz, Juannio National Art Exhibition, Rotary Auction, and the National Art Gallery. ; Awards In 1938 he won second prize in the National Competition Fair November. He also won first, second and third prizes at the Fiesta de los Morenos in Mixco, and won multiple prizes in Quetzaltenango. In the Arturo Mart√≠nez competition, won the first prize three consecutive times. ; National commissions In 1948, he was commissioned to help restore the National Palace of Guatemala and the Church of San Juan del Obispo. He restored altar pieces and colonial paintings. He also remade missing gilded gold leaf pieces for the colonial assemblies. ; National restoration project sponsored by UNESCO In 1956, the Guatemalan Commission for UNESCO organized and underwrote the restoration of several paintings from the Guatemalan colonial era. Projects were carried out in specialized workshops in the Capuchin Convent in Antigua. The restorations were led by a mission headed by a British expert sent by UNESCO, Helmut Ruhemann (1891‚Äì1973), and had as national partners to Carlos Morales, Luis √Ålvarez, and his son, Luis Alberto √Ålvarez. The Ministry of Education (es), directors of national museums and the directors of the Department of Fine Arts facilitated its development. The restored works were exhibited at the National School for the Arts. UNESCO bestowed √Ålvarez with a restorer diploma in 1956. ; Restoration in Guatemala City In 1958, he returned to Guatemala City to resume restoring works that had been delayed for over half a century, carving, gilding and parts embodied colonial style. He also devoted himself to the restoration of paintings and antique images. He taught privately at the Galer√≠a R√≠os, a gallery founded by Miguel √Ångel R√≠os (1914‚Äì1991) in the early 1950s. ; Educator In 1959, √Ålvarez joined the faculty of the National School of Arts where he flourished for 27 years until he retired to continue working in his workshop in Antigua, Guatemala.  Selected works  √Ålvarez, is known as a master of light who painted Guatemalan landscapes from unique perspectives. Often, √Ålvarez highlighted the contrast between light and shadows, creating optical illusions. * The \\"Corte de Cafe\\" (\\"Court of Coffee\\"), is one if his well-known works, which, as of 1992, has been depicted on the back of a 50 quetzal Guatemalan currency. The original is held by the Bank of Guatemala. Wind Turbines at Apogee Stadium Many of √Ålvarez's works are on permanent exhibition at Museo de Arte. * Alvarez painted a scene of people fleeing from volcanic lava flow, depicting people expressing distress. A road is illuminated by the light of lanterns and the bright glare of lava. The work, painted at night, is currently in a private collection in New York. * Another work showing an erupting Volcano sold in 1961 to the Bank of Guatemala. Tabacalera Nacional then reproduced it on an Almanac.  Formal education  At 14, √Ålvarez was in a workship of commercial painting. At 15, he began studying at the National School for the Arts in Guatemala City. His teachers included Humberto Garavito (1897‚Äì1970), Enrique Acu√±a Orantes (1876‚Äì1946), Antonio Tejeda Fonseca (1908‚Äì1966). Federico Wilhelm Schaeffer (es) (1887‚Äì1957), √ìscar Gonz√°lez Goyr√≠ (1887‚Äì1974), and Rafael Yela G√ºnther (1888‚Äì1942). At 16, he moved to the workshop called \\"El Tigre.\\" There, he designed labels and tags with drawings to the decanter and Tabacalera Nacional. He rapidly adapted to his new job and was mentored by the shop teacher Flavio Salazar.

Trained in the United Kingdom by Henry Cecil she raced for two seasons, winning five of her nine races. As a two-year-old she showed some promise, winning twice from five attempts. In the following year she did not run competitively until July, but after finishing third on her seasonal debut she established herself as one of the best middle-distance in Britain by winning the Nassau Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks and Twickenham Stakes. She was retired from racing at the end of 1979 and has had some influence as a broodmare. Background Connaught Bridge was a chestnut mare bred in Ireland by the Burton Agnes Stud. She had a number of white markings including a long white stocking on her right hind leg, white socks on her other feet, a large, diamond-shaped white star and a large white patch above her left nostril. She was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Connaught, a talented but temperamental horse who finished second in the 1968 Epsom Derby before winning the Eclipse Stakes in 1970 and two editions of the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Connaught Bridge's dam Fishermans Bridge was a talented racemare who finished second in the Nassau Stakes in 1973. She was descended from the broodmare Rustic Bridge, who produced the St Leger winning filly Cantelo and was the direct female-line ancestor of the four-time Ascot Gold Cup winner Yeats. As a yearling, Connaught Bridge was sent to the sales and bought for 2,500 guineas by representatives of H. Barker. The filly was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1978: two-year-old season= After finishing second and third in minor races over five and six furlongs respectively, Connaught Bridge recorded her first win over seven furlongs in August, beating eleven opponents when odds-on favourite for a maiden race at Great Yarmouth Racecourse. When moved up in distance for a Nursery (a Handicap race for two-year-olds) over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse she was beaten a neck by the colt Messenger of Peace. On her final appearance of the season the filly was moved up in distance and defeated twenty opponents in a minor event over nine furlongs at Wolverhampton Racecourse in October. =1979: three-year-old season= As a three-year-old, Connaught Bridge did not race in the spring and did not contest either the 1000 Guineas or the Oaks Stakes. She made her seasonal debut in July when she finished third to the colts Conte Santi and Bold Shot over one mile at York Racecourse. Despite her defeat, she was the moved up in class and distance for the Nassau Stakes (then a Group Two race) over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse. She was ridden by Joe Mercer, who chose her in preference to the Cecil stable's other filly Odeon. She started at odds of 5/1 in a ten-runner field with her main opposition appearing to come from the French-trained fillies Tintagel (winner of the Prix Corrida) and Tempus Fugit (Prix de la Nonette, Prix Penelope, Prix Exbury). Connaught Bridge was among the leaders from the start before taking the advantage in the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths from Odeon with Tempus Fugit in third. In August Connaught Bridge was again moved up in class and distance for the Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York in which she was again by Mercer and she started at odds of 9/2. Her four opponents were Godetia, winner of the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Irish Oaks, Reprocolor (Lancashire Oaks), Senorita Poquito (runner-up in the Ribblesdale Stakes) and Britannia's Rule (winner of the Lupe Stakes and third in The Oaks). After racing at the rear of the field in the early stages, Connaught Bridge moved forward in the straight and engaged in a protracted struggle with Reproclor before drawing away in the final furlong. She won by three lengths from Senorita Poquito who overtook the weakening Reprocolor in the closing stages. Following her win at York, Connaught Bridge was sold privately to the breeder Peter Harris. On her only subsequent appearance, Connaught Bridge was brought back in distance for the Twickenham Stakes over ten furlongs on firm ground at Kempton Park Racecourse in September in which she was required to concede weight to opponents including Britannia's Rule, the Epsom Oaks runner-up Bonnie Isle and the Musidora Stakes winner Rimosa's Pet. After racing just behind the leaders in the early stages she moved to the front inside the last quarter mile and accelerated clear of her rivals to win by three lengths from Head Huntress. She did not race again, being withdrawn from an engagement in the Sun Chariot Stakes and was retired at the end of the year. Assessment and awards In the British Free Handicap for 1978, a ranking of the best two-year-olds to have raced in Great Britain that year, Connaught Bridge was given a weight of 112 pounds, 21 pounds behind the top-rated Tromos and fifteen pounds behind the top filly Devon Ditty. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 105, twenty-nine pounds behind Tromos and twenty-seven behind their top two-year-old filly Sigy. In their annual Racehorses of 1978 Timeform commented that she would be \\"suited by 1¬ºm+\\". In the International Classification for 1979, Connaught Bridge was the highest rated British- trained three-year-old filly level with One In A Million, but fourteen pounds behind the French filly Three Troikas. She was rated 124 by Timeform, nine pounds behind their top-rated three-year-old filly Three Troikas. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Connaught Bridge became a broodmare at Harris's Pendley Farm Stud in Hertfordshire. She produced at least eight foals and three winners between 1982 and 1994: *Kindjal, a filly, foaled in 1982, sired by Kris. Failed to win in three races. *Wassl Reef, bay colt, 1983, by Mill Reef. Won four races. *Conmaiche, bay colt, 1984, by Kings Lake. Won three races including the Prix Saint-Roman. *Munjarid, chestnut colt, 1985, by Habitat. Failed to win in fourteen races. *Class Adorns, bay filly, 1987, by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in two races. *Lydia Maria, bay filly, 1988, by Dancing Brave. Failed to win in nine races. *Dorothea Brooke, bay filly, 1992, by Dancing Brave. Won one of her ten races. As a broodmare, she is the dam of the Middle Park Stakes winner Primo Valentino and the Cherry Hinton Stakes winner Dora Carrington, herself the dam of the Colin Stephen Quality Handicap winner Julienas *Kristal Bridge, chestnut filly, 1994, by Kris. Failed to win in eight races. As a broodmare she produced Overturn.

Function  microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post- transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop.

Early life Wogan was the second son of William Wogan and his wife, Anne Gaydon. His great-grandfather, William Wogan of Rathcoffey (1544‚Äì1616), was twelfth in descent from Sir John Wogan, Chief Justice of Ireland. Career as soldier In 1715 Charles and his younger brother Nicholas took service under Colonel Henry Oxburgh, whose force surrendered to General Charles Wills at Preston on 14 November. In the following April the grand jury of Westminster found a true bill against Wogan, and his trial for high treason was appointed to take place in Westminster Hall on 5 May 1716 (cf. Hist. Reg. Chron. Diary, p. 221). At midnight on the eve of the trial Wogan took part in the successful escape from Newgate prison planned by Brigadier Mackintosh. He was one of the lucky seven (out of the fifteen) who made good their escape, and for whose recapture a reward of 500 pounds was vainly offered (Griffith, Chronicles of Newgate, i. 313). He succeeded in getting to France, where he took service in Dillon's regiment until 1718. In that year he followed the chevalier to Rome. At the close of the same year he served with Ormonde on a diplomatic mission to win a Russian princess's hand for the exiled prince James Francis Edward Stuart. He failed, and selected Maria Clementina Sobieska, granddaughter of the famous John Sobieski. Clementina, on her way to join the chevalier at Bologna, was arrested by the order of the emperor (to whom the goodwill of the British government was of paramount importance) at Innsbruck, whence Wogan, with three kinsmen, Richard Gaydon, Captain Missett, and Ensign Edward O'Toole, released her in a romantic manner (27 April 1719). For this exploit the pope, Clement XI, conferred upon Wogan the title of Roman senator (13 June 1719). James rewarded Wogan by a baronetcy. Wogan then took service as a colonel in the Spanish army, and in 1723 distinguished himself at the relief of Santa Cruz, besieged by the Moors under the Bey Bigotellos. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general and made governor of La Mancha. Thence he sent to Jonathan Swift in 1732 a cask of Spanish wine and a parcel of his writings. Swift wrote him in return a characteristic letter deploring that he did not see his way to get Wogan's effusions published: ‚ÄòDublin booksellers,‚Äô he says, ‚Äòhave not the least notion of paying for copy.‚Äô On 27 February 1733 Wogan despatched to Swift, in his capacity as the ‚Äòmentor and champion of the Irish nation,‚Äô a long budget of grievances (printed in Scott's Swift, xvii. 447‚Äì97). He followed this up with another cask of Spanish wine, the merits of which Swift acknowledged in another entertaining letter (ib. xviii. 341). Later life In 1746 the Chevalier Wogan was with the Duke of York at Dunkirk in the hope of being able to join Prince Charles Edward in England (see Stuart MSS. at Windsor, Wogan to Edgar, 1752). He seems to have returned to La Mancha, and to have died there soon after 1752.

The project's main beneficiaries have been Gregory Marino and The Fairbanks Four. Mission The goals of the Alaska Innocence Project are: * To identify, investigate, and exonerate individuals who have been wrongly convicted in the state of Alaska. * To provide educational opportunities for advocates and for the public that foster a culture that champions the defense of the innocent. * To suggest and implement policies, practices and reforms that will prevent wrongful convictions and hasten the identification and release of innocent persons. Leadership The Alaska Innocence Project's Executive Director is William B. Oberly. Mr. Oberly is an attorney in Anchorage, Alaska and the owner of William B. Oberly Law Offices. Oberly was an interviewer in the Judges of Alaska Project Jukebox of the Digital Branch of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Oral History Program. Cases =Gregory Marino= The Alaska Innocence Project filed its first court case seeking to establish innocence on April 20, 2009. Gregory Marino was convicted of murder and attempted murder in 1994 and has spent the last 16 years incarcerated on those charges. At the time of his trial, Marino was excluded as the source of all usable prints collected at the crime and could not be positively identified through the then available DNA testing as the source of any biological or forensic evidence found at the crime scene. As a result of the Alaska Innocence Project's filing in this case, the State of Alaska has agreed to make evidence available for testing. The State will compare the finger and palm prints from the crime scene to updated data bases to determine if the source of those prints can be identified. Following those results, the State will make biological evidence available for more effective and discerning testing then was available at the time of Marino's trial, to try to determine the source of that evidence. The Alaska Innocence Project is currently attempting to raise funds to pay for this testing which will likely cost at least $20,000.00. Mr. Marino will have to wait for this testing to support his innocence claim until the funds can be raised. =The Fairbanks Four= The Fairbanks Four at a potlatch held in their honor at the Big Dipper Ice Arena in Fairbanks on October 19, 2016. Marvin Roberts speaks while (from left) George Frese, Eugene Vent and Kevin Pease stand behind him. Hours after Alaskan teenager John Hartman was found dead near a street corner in downtown Fairbanks in 1997, police picked up and coerced confessions from two of Hartman's high-school classmates ‚Äî George Frese and Eugene Vent. During an early-hours interrogation of the two young boys, who were intoxicated and unaccompanied by parents or a lawyer, they were led to believe both Marvin Roberts and Kevin Pease were also involved. Despite the lack of any physical evidence, witnesses, motive or even explanation, all four were convicted of the murder. The group of boys became known as the \\"Fairbanks Four.\\" In the years following their convictions, Frese and Vent recanted and claimed their confessions were false. In 2013 the Alaska Dispatch reported that Frese, 36; Vent, 33; Roberts, 35; and Pease, 35 \\"have maintained their innocence in prison ever since, first serving time in Arizona, Colorado, and now back in Alaska.\\" According to new evidence presented by the Alaska Innocence Project, another man ‚Äî William Holmes ‚Äî said in a sworn affidavit that he and another group of Fairbanks teenagers killed Hartman. Holmes is serving a life sentence for the murder of two people in California that happened after the Fairbanks crime. One week after the Alaska Innocence Project filed court documents citing new evidence that may suggest that four men who were convicted of the 1997 deadly beating of a classmate are innocent, the Alaska Department of Law ordered an independent review of the case. Following a five-week post conviction relief hearing but before the judge had an opportunity to make a decision, the state negotiated an agreed settlement resulting in the dismissal of the conviction and the freeing of George Freese, Kevin Pease and Eugene Vent on December 17, 2015. The fourth man, Marvin Roberts, had already been released on parole earlier in the year. As part of the agreement, the men agreed to withdraw their claim of prosecutorial misconduct and to not sue the state or the city of Fairbanks.

During the struggles to free Old Serbia and Macedonia from the Ottoman yoke, the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and World War I, Krstiƒá fought as a Chetnik voivode.  Life  Krstiƒá was born in the village of Labuni≈°ta in the Drimkol area (known as Mala ≈†umadija) north of Struga (present-day Republic of Macedonia, then in Ottoman Empire) into a Serb family of peƒçalbari, whose work took them away from their homeland to earn for living but always kept close connections to their homeland. His father, Martin, worked as a milkman in Belgrade and Andjelko joined him at a young age. Unhappy about this work, he wanted to get an education and enroll in an evening course in Saint Sava school for teachers. His father opposed his decision, took him back to native Labuni≈°ta and pressed him to marry, aged only 17. However, Andjelko decided to oppose his father more resolutely when he wanted to take him to work with him in Romania. Instead, he returned to Belgrade and started working as a milkman assistant with his compatriot Marko ≈†umenkoviƒá while in the evenings he attended school lessons. Professors soon noticed his diligence and helped him with a small stipend. He graduated in August 1889 with excellent grades. Despite an offer to stay in Belgrade Krstiƒá decided to go back to his native village. World War I and After Back in Old Serbia, despite many obstacles imposed by the Ottoman authorities and the Bulgarian Exarchate, he managed to open Serbian schools in the neighboring village of Podgorec and often collaborated with the Chetniks (members of the Serbian Chetnik Organization). He was arrested by Turkish authorities for his patriotic work several times. In 1911 he became the head principal of all the Serb schools in the areas of Debar, Struga, ≈†tip and Ohrid. Following October 1915 invasion of Serbia during World War I at the hands of German, Austro- Hungarian and Bulgarian armies, the Serbian army retreated through Albania, an event sometimes called the Albanian Golgotha. Kostiƒá was among the lucky ones who survived and from Thessaloniki he participated in the Serbian army's offensive. Serbian and French forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing Bitola on 19 November 1916. They finally made a breakthrough; this breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, which led to the final victory of World War I. In 1924 he was offered by Bora Stankoviƒá a post in the Ministry of Education in Belgrade. Although he hesitated in 1940 he was appointed as an editor of Glas juga newspaper from Skopje, where he remained until the Nazi occupation in 1941. Krstiƒá, modest as he was, spent the most of his life where he was born. He died in 1952 and was, by his own wish, buried on a hill underneath Mount Jablanica.  Works  His first writing, descriptions of local customs, appeared in 1904 in Carigradski glasnik, a Serb newspaper printed in Constantinople. He wrote under the pen name Drimkolac (Drimkol is the name of the Struga area). His first short story saw the light of day in 1903 in the same newspaper.

The breakthrough came in 1932 when a collection of his short stories was published in Belgrade. In the same year, he also published Trajan, a novel that includes many autobiographical elements. For both books, he received praise and won several literary awards. He also wrote a drama Zatoƒçnici (1937) that was performed in Skopje that same year, as well as another book of short stories published in 1951.

It is the largest student newspaper in the United Kingdom and is distributed throughout Greater Manchester. The name is a portmanteau of Mancunian, the demonym for residents of Manchester, and union, given its role as the newspaper of the Students' Union. Past writers include film critics Mark Kermode. History The Mancunion has existed in a various forms since 1964. It was first published in 1964 as a bulletin concerned with Union affairs, produced by the Union to compensate for perceived shortfalls in coverage in the main student newspaper, the Manchester Independent. Originally a rather amateurish publication, produced at irregular intervals, it is now a highly professional, tabloid-style newspaper, publishing news and articles on a wide range of issues and subjects. The newspaper and its journalists have won national student newspaper awards on several occasions. On 22 September 1997 Student Direct replaced The Mancunion; this was a joint venture with other student unions in Manchester to create a single company to publish their newspapers. Student newspapers had been losing an increasing amount of money, and it was felt that pooling of resources could moderate this. Student Direct became the largest student newspaper in the country, owned by the University of Manchester, University of Salford and Bolton Institute. Each produced its own edition of the paper, but with most of the editorial work being undertaken at the University of Manchester Manchester Students' Union. For the 2009/2010 academic year the Student Direct began to split into its component parts, with the Manchester edition becoming \\"Student Direct: Mancunion edition\\". By the 2010/2011 academic year they had fully transitioned to The Mancunion and The Salfordian, the student newspaper of the University of Salford Students' Union. The Mancunion drew national attention in 2013 when a secret recording was made during a society meeting, at which it was suggested that the Islamist speaker supported the execution of homosexuals in Britain. The controversy that arose regarded both the sensitive content of what was said, as well as the ethical questions behind such investigative reporting methods. The society in question later dissolved following the scandal. In October 2014, British tabloid The Sun contacted UK student media outlets asking them to find photos of students wearing offensive costumes at Halloween. The Mancunion broke this story, leading to attention from national media. In September 2016 the Mancunion once again drew national attention both within the mainstream media and on social media with their coverage of the decapitation of a Margaret Thatcher cardboard cut-out at the Freshers Fair.h[ttp://mancunion.com/2016/09/21/margaret-thatcher-cardboard-cut-out- decapitated-freshers-fair] Structure The Mancunion is based within the Students' Union but retains editorial independence from it. In the past it has criticised the Students' Union and university in equal measure. As of 2015, the role of Editor-in-chief of the newspaper has been restored to a full-time salaried position after a number of years of campaigning for it to be a sabbatical position, though now as co-ordinator of the Manchester Media Group, as a sabbatical role within the Union. This involves co-ordinating the development of all Student Media within the Union, including Fuse TV and Fuse FM. The Editorial Team of The Mancunion is structured as follows: Each section has at least one Editor, who commissions articles from student contributors, writes content themselves and sets the design of their own section each week. There are also Subeditors who proofread and check articles for inaccuracies, and a photography team. These editors are collectively co-ordinated by the Deputy Editor-in-chief and Editor-in-chief. The Mancunion covers news occurring in the area around the University of Manchester campuses, as well as things that affect the national or international student body. It covers local cultural events and even national music festivals. Its opinion pieces focus on both local news, student issues, as well as the state of society as a whole. The Mancunion works closely with the other student media outlets in the Union, Fuse TV and Fuse FM. This involves collaborating on projects and promoting the other outlets' work on its website and social media accounts. The Mancunion is also affiliated with the Student Publication Association. In 2016, as part of the Manchester Media Group, Mancunion editors and student media volunteers established the Women in Media Conference. A student-led conference aiming to tackle gender bias within the media and encourage female students to pursue media careers. The conference is now an established part of the year for student media at the University of Manchester and plans have already begun for their third conference in 2018.

He was arrested on January 26, 2015, charged with, and pleading guilty to, spying on the United States for the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Buryakov was a New York-based Deputy Representative of Vnesheconombank, Russia's state- owned national development bank. Buryakov operated with non-official cover, and was thus not entitled to diplomatic immunity. Buryakov conducted his espionage with the assistance of Igor Sporyshev, Trade Representative of the Russian Federation to New York, and Victor Podobnyy, an Attach√© to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. In exchange for pleading guilty, Buryakov received a reduced sentence of 30 months in federal prison and fined $100,000. He was released early from prison on 31 March 2017 and deported from the United States six days later. Early life and family Buryakov was born on March 2, 1975, in Krasnodar Krai, and previously worked at a tax office in Moscow before coming to America. His father, Yevgeny Petrovich Buryakov, is an engineer at the Russian Embassy in Tunis. His wife, Marina, said they met in Kushchevskaya in 1994 in when she was in high school. They married in May 1999. They have one son and one daughter. After Buryakov's arrest in 2015, his mother, Tatiana, returned from Tunis to Moscow to help look after his children. Espionage Prior to working in New York City, Buryakov worked in Pretoria under non-official cover from October 1, 2004, to April 30, 2009 Beginning around March 2012, in dozens of occasions at locations in and around Manhattan and the Bronx, Buryakov began meeting with Sporyshev and Podobnyy for the purpose of exchanging information related to their work as intelligence officers operating within the United States at the direction of the Russian SVR. They tasked Buryakov with attempting to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources, as well as gathering information about U.S. sanctions on Russia and U.S. efforts to develop alternative energy resources. Buryakov worked for Directorate ER of the SVR, which is focused on economic intelligence. Buryakov also came up with questions for the Russian News Agency TASS to ask at the New York Stock Exchange regarding high-frequency trading , exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and automatic trading robots. Beginning in 2013, an undercover agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), posing as an analyst for an energy firm, began providing Sporyshev with binders containing industry analyses and bugged with hidden microphones, allowing the FBI to record Sporyshev, Podobnyy, and other Russian intelligence personnel. The undercover agent met Buryakov at a Manhattan office, as well as at casinos in Atlantic City. On April 3, 2017, Carter Page revealed to BuzzFeed that he is \\"Male-1\\" in the January 2015 indictments against Evgeny Buryakov, Viktor Podobnyy, and Igor Sporyshev and that Page had met with Podobnyy beginning in 2013. In January 2015, the three Russians were charged with overtly conspiring against the United States and that Buryakov had been an unregistered agent of a foreign government. In absentia, 40 year old Podobnyy and 27 year old Sporyshev were charged also with aiding and abetting Buryakov, but were not arrested because Podobnyy and Sporyshev, as officials of the Russian government, left the United States under diplomatic immunity. During the investigations of the three Russians, the United States government used recorded transcripts of their conversations. Later, during October 2016 when the FBI and the Justice Department officials obtained a 90-day warrant for electronic surveillance of Carter Page who had ceased being an adviser to Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application included Page's relationships with Buryakov, Podobnyy, and Sporyshev as part of the basis for obtaining the warrant. Conviction Buryakov's defense, financed by Vnesheconombank, argued that he was protected from the charges by virtue of being an official employee of the Russian government, though this argument was rejected by Judge Richard M. Berman. Buryakov ultimately pleaded guilty to the charges against him, and was sentenced to 30 months in prison and a $100,000 fine. He served his sentence at the minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution in Elkton, Ohio. He was released early, on 31 March 2017, and deported back to Russia on 5 April 2017.

Established by Luftwaffe in 1940, remained in use throughout the Second World War, until 1945. The airfield consisted of a wooden runway measuring . The airport was little used and only a squadron of meteorological observation aircraft where stationed there. Its main role thus remained as a backup of the larger air stations of √òrland and V√¶rnes. √òysand was proposed as the site to build the German exclave Nordstern, but the plans never materialized. History Planning of √òysand commenced on 6 May 1940, just a month after the German invasion of Norway. Surveying was carried out by geologist K. Richter on behalf of Luftwaffe. He considered both √òysand and H√∏stad in Byneset and found the former to be most suitable. Richter proposed three different runway configurations, varying between in length.Brovold: 23 There was no German contractors available in Tr√∏ndelag at the time and therefore Luftwaffe organized construction with Norwegian workers, bused from Trondheim every day. The local school, chapel and youth center were requisitioned for storage space.Brovold: 24 The Gaulosen delta with √òysand in the background, looking from Byneset The work was sufficient by August 1940 that the airport could be used. It was a \\"field airport\\", so that it was not intended to have a garrison,Brovold: 26 receiving a runway.Brovold: 28 German soldiers initially stayed at surrounding farms, until the 1941 opening of the barracks. A radio station was first established at √òy√•s, later moved to Finnset.Brovold: 29 Only in the summer of 1944 was the airfield upgraded to a firm, wooden structure,Brovold: 27 This was because of difficulties in procuring sufficient wood for the runway. √òysand's role was mostly to act as a reserve airport for √òrland and V√¶rnes. It had a major ammunition storage and was commonly used to restock Junkers Ju 88s. Ju 52 transporters were another common sight.Brovold: 34 Ten dummy aircraft of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters were placed to fool intelligence.Brovold: 35 The German Army used the airfield on occasion for training. This included a 1942 training with flame fougasses.Brovold: 37 The airport was selected as the ground aerodrome to serve any German aircraft carriers when these were in the Trondheimsfjord. However, the termination of the carrier program caused these plans to be shelved. A fixed wooden surface was installed on the runway in mid-1944,Hafsten: 319 allowing √òysand to play a role in the North Atlantic weather war.Brovold: 38 From November 1944, Wetterstaffel 3 was stationed at √òysand, using Ju 88 and Ju 188 aircraftHafsten: 225 for meteorological observations in the North Atlantic. The Kriegsmarine established a major presence in Norway, but was cut off without a major naval port and dry dock. √òysand was proposed as a suitable site for such naval base, which would have been built up as a major air force and naval site. Estimates for the plans, which were named Nordstern, were for a population of 250,000 of exclusively Germans.Spotts: 331 However, all that was ever realized at √òysand was the airfield and a small army base, as well as a series of prison camps.Brovold: 7 Facilities The airport was situated at √òysand in Melhus, a flat agricultural peninsula in Gaulosen, the delta of the river Gaula.Brovold: 10 The airport originally featured a wooden runway measuring . This was later upgraded and given wooden surface measuring . Taxiways were built in a fan- shape out from the runway, leading to aircraft shelters. These received earthwork walls to protect them for enemy fire. A radio station at Finnset received two antennas and was manned with between two and five people at any time.Brovold: 30 The air defense consisted of a 20 mm gun situated just south of Reitbakken, as well as machine gun positions in √òyberget. The airfield was also covered by the artillery position between Nypan and Kvammen, which had an 88 mm gun, a 10.5 cm gun and a 12.8 cm gun. However, these were not primarily aimed at air defense but rather as part of the coastal artillery. However, they had excellent coverage of the air space of √òysand. Accidents and incidents * On 12 December 1944 a Heinkel bomber crashed after attempting to land at √òysand. Damaged, it attempted the landing at too low an altitude. It pulled up, but after a left banking the pilots lost control and the aircraft crashed in Leinstrand, killing one on board. * On 8 May 1945, the day the war ended, two intoxicated airmen took off with a Ju 52 aircraft. It crashed shortly after take-off into a residence in Buvika.

Eligible service should be far superior to that usually expected of an individual of their rank, it should demonstrate significant leadership accomplishments, or is a significant and substantial contribution to the Government. * Outstanding career service, worthy of special recognition, based on the sustained performance of an officer over multiple assignments. Service should have tangible and sustained achievements in leadership, management and government service.  Ribbon devices Each additional award of the medal is denoted by a inch gold star for the full size medal suspension ribbon and service ribbon and a inch gold star for the miniature medal suspension ribbon.

It has since been supported by government officials and different businesses. Bhutan's film industry is highly influenced by neighboring India's Bollywood, with most Bhutanese films being adaptations of Indian ones or based on the Bollywood format. In the 21st century there have been calls by local filmmakers for a tilt towards originality in Bhutanese cinema. Many films have started to blend Indian cinema with local Buddhist teachings and traditions, and Bollywood films are now rarely seen in Bhutanese cinema halls after more than a decade of domination. Storytelling based on Buddhist oral history and supernatural beliefs are increasingly influencing Bhutanese cinematic structure. , Bhutan's film industry produced an average of thirty films a year. By 2012, Thimpu had six cinema halls.Two new cinema halls in Thimphu ‚Äì BBS Some voices are confident that Bhutan's film industry is expected to grow and innovate in the future. History In 1989, Ugyen Wangdi directed Gasa Lamai Singye, the first, pioneer Bhutanese feature film. Gasa Lamai Singye, a tragic love story reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, had a remake in 2016, directed by Sonam Lhendup Tshering. Wangdi went on to direct several documentary films His Yonten Gi Kawa (Price of Knowledge, 1998) was the first documentary made in Bhutan, and followed the daily life of a 11-year-old boy at home and school. It was followed by Yi Khel Gi Kawa (Price of A Letter, 2004), where Wangdi tells the story of a postal runner who worked throughout Bhutan for 26 years. In 1999, Tshering Wangyel released the first commercially successful movie in Dzongkha language, Rewaa (Hope), a love story where two college boys fall for the same girl. As one critic put it, \\"the commercial Bhutanese film industry was born.\\" Wangyel went on to produce some 50 movies and died of pneumonia while making his last film. In 2007, he had produced Bakchha, the first Bhutanese horror movie. Buddhist monk Khyentse Norbu directed four award- winning films, The Cup (1999), Travellers and Magicians (2003), Vara: A Blessing (2013), and Hema Hema: Sing Me A Song While I Wait (2016). Travellers and Magicians was the first feature film to be entirely shot within Bhutan. Hema Hema, which tells its story by following a mysterious ritual in the forest where all participants are masked, was praised by critics for \\"its portrayal of complex Buddhist themes like transgression, by juxtaposing them on to modern topics like anonymity on the Internet.\\" A pupil of Norbu, Neten Chokling, another Buddhist lama, directed in 2006 Milarepa. The Holder, a short film, coordinated by Jamyang Dorji, debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and was screened in Brussels together with Original Photocopy of Happiness by Dechen Roder, a young director from Bumthang who went on to direct in 2016 the mystery film Honeygiver Among the Dogs. The movie was described as \\"a genre-bending work, blending elements of neo-noir with Bhutanese mysticism.\\" in 2014, Karma Dhendup directed Ap Bokto, a 3-d computer-animated fim based on a Bhutanese folk tale. In 2016, Drukten: The Dragon's Treasure was the first Bhutanese 2-d animation movie. Female directors are rare in Bhutan. One is Kesang Chuki, who produced ten documentaries, docudramas, and short movies, including Nangi Aums to Go-thrips (Housewives to Leaders, 2011), about the problems of Bhutanese women who assume public roles, and A Young Democracy (2008), where Chuki accompanies two candidates in their campaigns for the first ever democratic election in Bhutan. The Bhutan Beskop film celebration (2010, 2011) was a significant event for the local film industry. Financial specialists and sometimes banks fund new productions that are screened in one of Bhutan's several cinemas, of which the Lugar Lobby in Thimpu with 880 seats is the biggest. A sum of 152 Bhutanese movies were created in the main decade of the 21st century. Bhutan has two distribution houses. Business movies are periodically in light of an \\"affection\\" subject, here and there joined with a social issue (HIV, urbanization) taking after a customary script with exchanges, tunes, dances, complicated relations and a battle. Spending plans change from $15,000 to $50,000. Compensations for performers and vocalists have gone up from $1,000 (2006) to $10,000 per film for top on-screen characters in 2011. Real uses for film preparations are coordinations, gear and compensations. The brut income for a well known film (up to 90,000 onlookers) may reach up to $140,000, while less well known movies may raise half of it and unpopular movies hazard shortages. Main issues =Market= The Bhutanese market is small. Leading Bhutanese director Tshering Wangyel recalled in 2015 that in the 20th century, \\"distribution was an ordeal, requiring filmmakers to carry generators, fuel, and screening equipment from village to village.\\" Much has improved in the 21st century but, according to Wangyel \\"distribution continues to be a slog, handicapping the industry's growth.\\" Despite these problems, Wangyel said, \\"the industry is thriving, with audiences in one of the most remote countries on earth flocking to homegrown movies.\\" =Production= Bhutan's film industry has a limited number of studios, with incomplete equipment. Most directors contribute money to the their own productions, although in the 21st century international funding has been occasionally available. =Quality= A few Bhutanese movies have won international acclaim. Others are seen as repetitious, returning time and again on Buddhist legends and the \\"clash between tradition and modernity, with conservatism getting the last word as characters hold forth on the importance of prayer and background chants urge viewers to be good Buddhists.\\" However, change is slowly emerging. In 2017, R.C. Chand's film Thimpu was hailed as \\"doing away with the notion that all independent Bhutanese movies draw upon the country's Buddhist mysticism,\\" as it presents the life of Bhutan's capital through different characters, including an alcoholic family, a transgender woman, and a young singer with problems of career and love. =Dissemination= Although regular movie theaters now exist in all the largest cities, it is still necessary today to \\"lug a makeshift cinema from village to village to reach Bhutan movie-loving population,\\" renting school auditoriums or setting up a tent in each venue. According to director Wangyel, \\"it takes a year to cover the country for screenings.\\" =Piracy= Piracy has been a worldwide issue and influences the Bhutan film industry. DVDs are effortlessly duplicated in Nepal/India and retailed through shops in the urban areas. Anti-theft measures are regarded as largely insufficient. \\"The long wait for screenings\\" has been blamed for the flourishing of a piracy industry servicing \\"impatient audiences eager to watch illegal copies of Dzongkha-language films.\\" Future The government of Bhutan regards cinema as important, and has committed itself to promote the local production with adequate studios and support, and more effective policies against copyright infringement. Critical voices like director Tashy Gyeltshen are afraid that \\"the relentless push to promote tradition while imitating Bollywood formula risk creating a 'cultural desert' for future generations,\\" with the most acclaimed directors just \\"wallowing in past glory.\\" There are also, however, more optimistic voices, persuaded that change is coming with a new generation of Bhutanese directors who \\"shun the influence of Bollywood and look inward,\\" a process that has been rewarded with prizes in international festivals.

He is most notable for coming fourth in the sixth season of Megaszt√°r in 2012. Personal life Bal√°zs was born on 30 May 1990 in Budapest. He attended N√©metv√∂lgyi Primary School and studied at the Hungarian-British international school from 1997 to 2000. During this time, he studied the piano and clarinet for four years. After four years of learning English, he returned to Hungarian education. He discontinued his learning of the piano and clarinet on the advice of Imre Benke. In 2001, he watched the film Blues Brothers 2000, which later affected his musical tastes and style. His influences included Eric Clapton, BB King, and Aretha Franklin. He attended Ba√°r-Madas Reformatory school. In 2006, he received his first guitar, which turned out to be also a turning point in his life. When he also received his first electric guitar, he became acquainted by the works of Stevie Ray Vaughan. His love for blues music continued to grow. He then began playing the guitar professionally with Edu√°rd Palatin and Elek Lakatos as mentors. In December 2009, Bal√°zs had an amateur orchestra at his side. He spent the 2007/2008 academic year as a private student in high school. He went on to study at the Cistercian High School in St. Emeric and spent the 2008/2009 Baccalaureate school year carrying out studies at T√∂r√∂kb√°lint Martin Valentine Elementary School. The three-year training at K≈ëb√°nyai Music Studio in 2010 was finished. Professional career Over a number of years, Bal√°zs has participated in a number of bands, most of them enthusiastic groups of young and inexperienced musicians, without any serious concepts or infrastructures to behold. In 2010, Bal√°zs joined the band Freezbee. In May 2011, he took the position of drums from Z√°dor Simonyi. Thereafter, two main people in the band (Ervin Krenyiczky and Gy√∂rgy Gassama) left. In 2011, Bal√°zs came up with the idea of participating in the sixth season of Megaszt√°r. In autumn of 2012, Freezbee disbanded. In late 2014, Bal√°zs was one of the names mentioned in a press conference to participate in A Dal 2015, the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. Later, his song was revealed to be called \\"Liar\\". On 24 January 2015, he participated in the first heat, succeeding Magyar Bori and preceding Gabi Sz≈±cs. He was eliminated from the first heat, receiving 37 points. Despite other entries gaining the same number of points, Bal√°zs got more mixed ratings from the judges than other songs and was not voted as the lone SMS and televote qualifier, that honour going to Timi Antal. After Megaszt√°r, his Orchestra made one song: \\"Look at me\\", which was released in September 2012.

The railway station was opened by the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) on its Moray Firth coast line in 1884, served by Aberdeen to Elgin trains. The station closed to regular passenger traffic on 21 September 1953, more than a decade before the total closure of the line itself in 1968. In 1921 the GNoSR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway and at nationalisation in 1948 became part of British Railways. The line itself was later recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. History =Background= In 1881 the Great North of Scotland Railway put a bill to parliament to extend its Portsoy line along the Moray Firth as far as Buckie. In 1882 the Great North of Scotland applied for permission to build a line from Portsoy following the coast to Buckie and then running on to Elgin. =Great North of Scotland Railway= Railway cutting at Glassaugh looking towards Cullen.

Review. School Library Journal. 1 Mar. 2013 (59.3): p.147. Girl Meets Ghost (2013) Daniella, the insistent and annoying ghost of a High School gymnast, demands Kendall's attention to help her \\"move on\\". Kendall would rather be spending her time worrying about a boy she has a crush on, Brandon, and her less than stellar math grades. Kendall's best friend Ellie is apparently in love with Brandon's unpredictable friend, Kyle, and Brandon keeps running into Kendall doing strange things like talking to herself (actually to ghosts) and digging in a graveyard. The ghost of Brandon's mom begins haunting Kendall and apparently warning her off of Brandon, though they have started dating. Kendall tries to convince Daniella's friend, Jen, to unwittingly help her solve the mystery of Daniella's haunting while Kendall is also worrying about the relationship between her dad and his friend Cindy. Kendall discovers that Daniella and Jen fought over a boy that Jen had dated first and that Jen's anger leads her to refuse Daniella a ride to a gymnastics meet. Daniella takes an ill-fated bus and dies, leaving Jen feeling responsible. Kendall, claiming to be a friend of Daniella's, mediates between the ghost and Jen and Daniella is able to move on when Jen believes that Daniella does not blame her. The Harder the Fall (2013) Kendall is visited by Lyra, the ghost of a fashionable teen who wanted to be a scientist, while the ghost's mother, struggling with depression following her daughter's death, is quickly going bankrupt and about to lose her business (an understaffed and under-equipped \\"spa\\"). Meanwhile, Kendall learns that Brandon's mother‚Äîwhose ghost is now haunting her with increasing force‚Äîwas friends in school with Kendall's absent mother. While apple picking with her father, Cindy, and Brandon, Kendall's father unexpectedly proposes to Cindy in public by giving her a \\"promise ring\\", which throws Kendall's home-life into turmoil. To make matters worse, things with Brandon are not going that well as a potential love interest enters the scene at school just as Kendall is behaving increasingly erratic, and Ellie is increasingly suspicious that Kendall is hiding something. Ghost of a Chance (2014) When helping a ghost named Lyra, Kendall started hanging with a boy named Micah, who is Lyra's brother. Now, her own boyfriend and her best friend won't even talk to her anymore. On top of that, her dad is getting serious with his girlfriend, Cindy, and Kendall has to help the ghost of her archenemy's sister, Lily. Kendall could not take it anymore! So, Kendall decides it's time to go see her mother (who ran away from Kendall when she was a baby) to find answers on this \\"seeing ghosts\\" thing. Hopefully, her mom will know the truth, or things will get a lot more worse.

S√∂dert√∂rn Home Guard Band () is a military band in the Swedish Home Guard. It is affiliated with the 1st Marine Regiment based at Berga Naval Base outside Stockholm. History A proposal was made in 1973 to have a Home Guard band in the √ñsterhaninge Home Guard area. The establishment of this unit was supported by the Home Guard Department at the Vaxholm defense area including the Home Guard Staff. The original title was the Handen Home Guard Band (Sw: Hemv√§rnets Musikk√•r Handen). The first performance took place on 21 September 1973.CD: Per aspera ad astra, Sj√∂v√§rnsk√•rens musikk√•r, 2001. During the 1970s and 1980s the band's title changed to the Haninge Home Guard Band (Sw: Hemv√§rnets Musikk√•r Haninge), the Haninge Fleet Forces Band (Sw: Flottans musikk√•r Handen) and the Haninge Air Force Band (Sw: Flygvapnets musikk√•r Handen) during the 1980s. In 1994, the band's status changed from that of a Home Guard band to being the Sj√∂v√§rnsk√•rens musikk√•r (En: Band of the Swedish Naval Volunteers). From 1978-2002 the Bandmaster was Major Sverker H√•llander. Under his leadership the band played at several military tattoos, where it became well known for innovative and distinctive figurative programs. Several well-received concerts and other performances took place outside Sweden. On 14 December 2010 the Swedish Home Guard Chief Brigadier General Roland Ekenberg decided that the unit should resume the status of a Home Guard Band, after having participated in an inspection of the Armed Forces Music held at the Life Guards in Stockholm. The band received its new title of S√∂dert√∂rn Home Guard Band on 1 January 2011. Organization The band currently consists of 45 active musicians. On parade, the unit often consists of up to 30 musicians and can perform figurative programs. The band members are volunteers, including leisure musicians, music college students, music teachers, professional military musicians and former military music conscripts. The band maintains Swedish musical traditions, using Swedish instruments such as the E flat cornet, B cornet and valve trombone. The band currently belongs to the 29th Home Guard Battalion at the S√∂dert√∂rn Training Wing, which is a part of the 1st Marine Regiment based outside Stockholm. At performances and representational functions the band wears a dress M1987 uniform, as authorized for the Amphibious Corps and including their rank insignia. It is the same uniform as that used by the 1st Marine Regiment except for the addition of red shoulder straps and a distinctive shoulder ornament. During parades, the band also wears white spats. The band is authorized to play at the Changing of the Guards ceremony in Stockholm and during official functions both in Sweden and abroad. When not playing as a Home Guard Band, the unit is called S√∂dert√∂rn Symphonic Band.

At the start of 2015, while still Leader of the Opposition, Tsipras stated that the programme is \\"not negotiable\\". After Syriza won a plurality in legislative elections held on 25 January 2015, Tsipras became Prime Minister of Greece and brokered a coalition with the right-wing anti- austerity Independent Greeks with the shared goal of immediate realisation of the programme. An official Syriza statement promised that the \\"new government will implement the Thessaloniki program to end the humanitarian crisis\\". On 13 July 2015, the Greek government and the European creditors reached an agreement under which the government had to implement harsh austerity measures, which effectively made the major economic measures proposed by the Thessaloniki programme virtually impossible to implement. The Four Pillars of the National Reconstruction Plan The programme is based on four pillars: # Confronting the humanitarian crisis # Restarting the economy and promoting tax justice # National plan to regain employment # Transforming the political system to deepen democracy At the European level, the programme demands a \\"European New Deal\\" of large-scale public investment by the European Investment Bank, extended quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, and a conference for the reduction of Greek and southern European debt modeled on the London Debt Agreement of 1953. Domestically, the programme sets out a \\"National Reconstruction Plan\\" based on the rebuilding and extending of the welfare state, and the strengthening of democratic institutions alongside the implementation of forms of direct democracy. These policies would be financed through revenues raised by combatting tax evasion and appropriating European funds from bodies such as the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund. Reception At the time of its publication, the programme was criticised by the New Democracy-led government for underestimating the costs of its pledges. Since then, it has also been criticised from within Syriza. In January 2015, Central Committee member Stathis Kouvelakis stated that the programme \\"was based on very over-optimistic estimates (or even simply wrong ones)\\".

Mus√©e Bonnat, Bayonne, France Hercules's Dog Discovers Purple Dye or The Discovery of Purple by Hercules's Dog is an oil painting by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens painted circa 1636, towards the end of his career. It depicts the mythical discovery of Tyrian purple by Hercules and his dog, and was one of dozens of oil on panel sketches made by Rubens for the decoration of the Torre de la Parada in Spain. A completed painting based on Rubens's sketch was made by Theodoor van Thulden in 1636-8, and is now held by the Prado Museum.Theodoor van Thulden, El descubrimiento de la p√∫rpura at the Prado (Spanish) Description Detail showing the dog with what appears to be a nautilus rather than a dye murex The painting shows a scene from an origin myth in the Onomasticon (a collection of names, similar to a thesaurus) of Julius Pollux, a 2nd-century Graeco-Roman sophist. In Pollux's story, Hercules and his dog were walking on the beach on their way to court a nymph named Tyro. The dog bit a sea snail, and the snail's blood dyed the dog's mouth Tyrian purple. Seeing this, the nymph demanded a gown of the same color, and the result was the origin of purple dye. (Some ancient sources attribute the myth to Melqart, a Tyrian deity identified with Heracles.) Rubens's painting of this story depicts Hercules and the dog on the beach, with the dog's mouth stained.. Published on the occasion of Rubens, an exhibition at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Lille, France. Although the snail in the story should be a spiny murex, the kind of snail from which Tyrian purple was made, Rubens instead depicts a large smooth shell that resembles a nautilus. Context Rubens's painting was originally part of a cycle of paintings of Hercules, which Rubens painted for the Habsburg rulers of Spain as sketch for a painting intended to decorate their Torre de la Parada, a hunting lodge. The paintings of the cycle contain allegorical references to the Habsburgs and the wealth they had obtained from the conquest of Peru. The \\"royal purple\\" whose origin story this particular painting depicts was used to clothe emperors, and by the time of Rubens it had become a standard aspect of the depiction of royalty and divinity. By showing a scene of Hercules's travels to Phoenicia, the painting also refers to a traditional warning, attributed to the Phoenicians, to stay within the bounds of the Pillars of Hercules, and to the Habsburgs' own passage beyond that limit. Location and related works Rubens's sketch painting is in the Mus√©e Bonnat in Bayonne and is one of several works on Herculean subjects there. Others include a drawing of Hercules killing the Lernaean Hydra by Italian Renaissance painter Piero di Cosimo and a painting of Hercules killing Diomedes (c.1639‚Äì1641) by Charles Le Brun. Giorgio Vasari also painted the same subject, with a similar subtext referring to the wealth of his patron Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany; his version is in Studiolo of Francesco I of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. An oil painting based on Rubens's sketch by Theodoor van Thulden is in the Prado Museum.

The mall stretched three and half city blocks in length from Ontario Avenue south past New York Avenue on North 8th Street. The area is now the Harbor Centre Downtown.  History  The Sheboygan Redevelopment Authority was created in 1966 by the city's Common Council and was responsible for the redevelopment of the downtown. A master plan developed that year for rebuilding the downtown proposed a pedestrian plaza. The federal government approved the project in 1972 and timed with the 1974 completion of the new Mead Public Library, construction was completed in 1976, with official dedication and opening of the project coming during United States Bicentennial activities in July 1976. Plaza 8 was funded by the Federal Urban Renewal Agency and by the City of Sheboygan. The project was considered a failure by most standards, isolating the downtown area from the rest of the city, with large parking lots to accommodate expected visitors leaving Seventh and Ninth Streets (the main ways around Plaza 8) without buildings along them, and leaving the four-block area mostly quiet. The Sheboygan Transit transfer point at the south end of the project effectively blocked off trade in the block that it covered during transfer times and owners in the block found no purpose in maintaining their buildings discolored by heavy vehicle fumes and soot, leaving them in a derelict condition. Retail sales in the area did not improve and by 1989, a third of the area was vacant, with buildings condemned and torn down (with a couple used for the Jaycees' longtime haunted house fund-raising effort during that time). Plaza 8 was one of the last large projects financed by the Federal Urban Renewal Agency. Besides Prange's, the main strip of the mall was home to 16 retail shops and the entire side of one block was a vacant lot. The mall was removed in 1990 and traffic reintroduced to the Eighth Street corridor through the next three years, with the area renamed \\"Harbor Centre Downtown\\" in line with the city's new marketing effort for the downtown and north riverfront areas. The transfer point was shuffled around during those years until it found a permanent home a half-block west of the former on-street site a few years later. Since then, the City of Sheboygan has created the Harbor Centre Business Improvement District to manage the downtown, riverfront and recently developed South Pier District. The plaza was home to Prange's, Walgreens and numerous local stores and restaurants. The original Prange's building would stand until a flood and ensuing fire rendered it obsolete. Prange's rebuilt a new store on the same site. In 1992, the store name was changed after Younkers purchased the H.C. Prange Company. = Water main break and fires = The 74-year-old building that housed Prange's was damaged by a water main break in May 1983 after the building's support columns sagged. The building was in the process of being torn down when fire destroyed the store on October 16, 1983. Authorizes suggested the cause of the fire was arson. Burning debris caused damage to the City Hall and St. Clement's school gymnasium. The core of the building was built in 1909 and was expanded give times since then, the last time in 1969 and contained 235,000 square feet of retail space. It also served as headquarters for the Prange and Prangeway stores in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois. The building was reconstructed in 1984. As of 2014, the arsonist has never been caught and the fire remains one of Sheboygan's most prominent cold cases. = Sheboygan City Centre = In April 1987, the city had planned to put downtown including Plaza 8, under one roof. Developer John Livesey proposed a $100 million enclosed shopping and office complex, to be called City Center. The only buildings that would have remained in the City Center site were the relatively new Prange's and Mead Public Library buildings, along with the Trinity Lutheran Church, with a companion tower constructed next to the then-First Wisconsin Building. According to Livesey, the project would have included: * At least three department stores, including the existing Prange's, totaling almost 270,000 square-feet of space. * Two 15-story office buildings with 300,000 square-feet of space. * A 200-room hotel and convention center. * A four-screen movie theater and food court. * Parking for almost 3,500 cars. In August 1988, the project received a setback when one of two remaining department stores pulled out of the proposed development. Only a four-story addition to the north side of the First Wisconsin Building was constructed as part of City Centre. = Future = More recently, the Boston Store occupied the building of the former Prange's and Younkers closed in 2013. The building sat vacant for more than a year, being used for law enforcement training throughout 2014. Demolition of the store, located directly across from the fountain and Mead Public Library, was completed in March 2015. The city used the site in the summer 2015 as an open field for local concerts sponsored by the John Michael Kohler Arts Center and its yearly arts festival, with a multi-use development and performance stage opening in late summer 2017 known as City Green, which connects the JMKAC campus to the rest of the downtown area.  Water feature  Plaza 8 featured a water feature with a cascading effect which still stands to this day as part of the main entrance plaza for Mead Public Library, whose main entrance was re-focused to face Wisconsin Avenue rather than North 8th Street in a 1997 remodeling/addition. 250 trees, 350 flowering bushes and 5,000 flowers were planted with a $5.9 million federal grant. Additional features of the plaza included; new paving, lighting and sitting areas. With completion of the plaza in 1976, traffic was restricted on North 8th Street between New York Avenue from the south and Ontario Avenue to the north. The fountain's waterfall has a drop of approximately 10 feet with a flow of 10,000 gallons per minute. Due to concerns about drowning the city eventually had to post signs prohibiting wading and playing within the water feature. The plaza between the water feature and library, which had last been rehabilitated in 1992, was reconstructed throughout the summer of 2019 in order to better utilize the space, which had previously been all-concrete and featured obsolete electrical fixtures. A 1998 clock tower in front of the library containing four relief sculptures of library and art themes was removed, with the reliefs incorporated into four new structures along 8th Street lit by LEDs. During the Christmas season, the city's Christmas tree (lit after the city's holiday parade) stands in front of the main waterfall, with several smaller trees in stands along the waterfall's steps; after sunset, a Christmas tree light show composed to Christmas music plays over a short range radio transmitter at 87.7 FM programmed by Mead Public Library, with a range across downtown, repeats throughout the evening. After the Christmas season, the transmitter remains in use, playing classical music and also encompassing several interactive art structures installed by the John Michael Kohler Arts Center.

It is located in the Sint-Martinuskerk in Aalst, Belgium and shows Saint Roch.  Background  Devastating epidemics of the plague had swept through Europe beginning in the sixteenth century, and Rubens was commissioned by the Brotherhood of Saint Roch to paint an altarpiece for the Church of St Martin in Aalst, Belgium, where the lay brotherhood were installing an altar to Saint Roch, patron saint of invalids, and specially invoked against the plague. He lived in the fourteenth century and is said to have effected many miraculous cures, by the sign of the cross, the touch of his hand and prayer. Legend relates that while ministering at Piacenza, he fell ill himself and was cast out from the town. He recovered from the illness while living in the forest, and is portrayed as a pilgrim with a hat and staff, and a bubo on his thigh (a relic of his illness). He is often accompanied by a dog, representing the dog that brought bread to him and licked his wounds when he was ill. The altarpiece The overall dimensions of the altarpiece are , with an arched top. In 1794, Napoleonic troops moved the painting, with its two predella panels, to the Louvre. It was returned to Aalst in 1814. The altarpiece shows two groups of figures. In the upper group, Saint Roch is in prison praying for relief for those suffering from the plague. Then light bursts into the prison, a divine messenger appears accompanied by Christ himself; with his left hand Christ gestures towards the afflicted while with his right, he points to the golden inscription \\"Eris in peste patronus\\" (Thou shalt be the patron in the plague). Meanwhile, the lower group has become aware of the miracle taking place above, and are hopeful of recovery; even the shrouded figure on the right is hopeful of being raised from the dead. In this picture, Rubens uses the \\"diagonals\\" technique often used by baroque painters, as a means to link the upper group of figures, who gesture and lean downwards, with the supplicants below, whose outstretched arms and gaze draw the eyes diagonally back upwards to the higher group. The work is sometimes compared to Saint Roch Interceding with the Virgin for the Plague-Stricken, a 1780 painting by French artist Jacques-Louis David.

He was best known for his animal paintings and was nicknamed \\"Birkapiktor\\" (\\"Sheep-painter\\"). Biography He went to Budapest to pursue his art studies and work in the studios of , a German painter who was living there at the time. His parents were unable to support his studies for long, so he chose to support himself by selling copies of the old masters he made at the local museums, but eventually concluded that portrait painting would be most profitable. Soon after, he acquired an important patron; Count J√°nos Waldstein-Wartenberg (1809-1876), a well-known art collector. Lambs (before 1880) He spent some time at the Count's estate in V√°rpalota, doing portraits, some of his first animal paintings and frescoes for the library at Zichy Castle. In 1867, he was able to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, thanks to a state grant that the Count was able to obtain for him from Prime Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy.M≈±v√©szet, 1908 Biography and appreciation by K√°roly Lyka. His primary instructor there was Eduard von Engerth. In 1871, he received an extension of his grant and went to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where his teachers were Wilhelm von Diez and Karl von Piloty. It was there that he decided to devote himself to animal painting. He had his first showing at the 1873 World Exposition in Vienna. In 1874, he returned to Budapest and soon became popular with the aristocracy, so he continued to do portraits along with paintings of their favorite dogs and horses. =Singing career= Wintertime (1901) By 1880, he was successful enough to buy an old church, where he set up apartments and a studio.Szerelmem Budapest: \\"Church for Sale\\" Unfortunately, the amount of work he had been doing created a severe case of eyestrain and, on his doctor's advice, he gave up painting for a while. Rather than remain inactive, he began to take singing lessons. In 1883, encouraged by his friends and family, he sold his studio (which later became a church again) and toured Germany; performing in several major cities, including Weimar, singing opera arias. He eventually learned thirty different operatic roles and was especially successful with the works of Richard Wagner. D√ºsseldorf became his base of operations and he spent his summers in Nordkirchen, at the Esterh√°zy estates. Once that he felt his eyes had sufficiently recovered, he had sheep brought to D√ºsseldorf and started painting again. With the help of Prince Nikolaus, he was able to re-establish himself in the art world. In 1887, he took up residence at the Esterh√°zy Palace in Tata, where he continued to display his singing talent at the castle theater and directed some productions as well as painting the theater's ceiling. He also exhibited widely, including a show at the Salon in 1890. That same year, he acquired property in the Epreskert Art Colony and built a studio there. It is currently known as the \\"Atelier Kernstok\\" after a famous later resident, the artist K√°roly Kernstok. References Further reading *\\"B√©la P√°llik\\" from Magyar m≈±v√©szek by Tam√°s Szana.

It is approximately long and flows through Conyngham Township. The creek's watershed has an area of . It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek is ephemeral and loses its flow to underground mines. Varying concentrations of many alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals occur in water in the creek's watershed. The watershed typically experiences relatively mild temperatures. It is mainly accessible via U.S. Route 11, Pennsylvania Route 239, and a local road. Black Creek is situated within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal beds in the watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining was done in the watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s. Course Satellite map of Black Creek Black Creek begins in a valley in Conyngham Township. It flows west-northwest for nearly a mile, passing through a large pond or small lake, before turning north for several hundred feet. The creek then turns west for a short distance and enters a broader and much shallower valley before receiving an unnamed tributary from the right. It then turns southwest for more than a mile before turning south-southwest and flowing through a deep and narrow valley to the northern border of Mocanaqua. The creek then turns west for a few tenths of a mile, following the border of Mocanaqua to its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Black Creek joins the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth. =Tributaries= Black Creek has no officially named tributaries. However, an 1887 book stated that the creek had two tributaries. One was unnamed and flowed from a point west of the DuPont Drift to the creek at the Golden Drift. The other was referred to as Turkey Pond Creek and was sometimes nearly dry, but could have a substantial flow during spring rains. Hydrology and climate Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used to drain an area between Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, but now loses its flow to underground mines via broken bedrock. Its channel is also disrupted by strip mines and rock piles.Newport, 52 The waters of Black Creek are acidic. Anions in the waters of the Black Creek drainage basin include sulfate and bicarbonate.Newport, 76 The concentrations of aluminum in the mine pools in the area are typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters in the watershed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non- polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.Newport 100-104 Sodium and potassium occur in water in the Black Creek watershed, with sodium being considerably more common than potassium. Potassium concentrations are around 20 milligrams per liter, while sodium concentrations are less than 10 milligrams per liter.Newport, 106 Lithium and rubidium also have been observed in the watershed, with concentrations of 0.02 to 0.2 and 0.04 milligrams per liter, respectively.Newport, 113 Barium occurs in the water of the Black Creek watershed, typically at concentrations of less than 0.07 milligrams per liter. Beryllium is about as common, with a concentration of less than 0.06 milligrams per liter.Newport, 114 Strontium is much more common, with a concentration of up to 4.4 milligrams per liter. The concentration of titanium in the waters of the Black Creek watershed is less than 0.17 milligrams per liter and the concentration of zirconium is less than 0.055 milligrams per liter. Small amounts (less than 0.01 milligrams per liter) of vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum also occur in the water. The cobalt concentration in mine waters in the watershed ranges from 0.07 to 0.93 milligrams per liter and the nickel concentration ranges from 0.09 to 1.2 milligrams per liter.Newport, 115 Copper, silver, tin, and lead also occur in the watershed.Newport, 117 The concentration of chloride ions in the watershed of Black Creek ranges from 0 to 14 milligrams per liter.Newport, 110 A 1971 report described the climate in the watershed of Black Creek as \\"mild\\". Temperatures above are rare in the area, but temperatures below are common. At the United States Weather Bureau station in Wilkes-Barre, the highest recorded temperature between 1945 and 1966 was and the lowest was . Killing frosts have been recorded as early as October and as late as May.Newport, 51 Geography The elevation near the mouth of Black Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The lowest elevations in the watershed are approximately above sea level and they occur near the Susquehanna River. The highest part of the watershed is a ridge in the northern part of the watershed; this area has an elevation of above sea level. The highest level of topographic relief in the watershed is and local relief can be as high as , but is typically less than .Newport, 17 The watershed of Black Creek is situated at the southwestern end of the Northern Anthracite Coal Field.Newport, 12 The watershed is also part of a \\"long, narrow, complexly deformed\\" synclinorium, with complex folds and faults.Newport, 13, 37 The watershed of the creek is within the filled-in valley of the preglacial Susquehanna River.Newport, 29 The watershed contains three downwarped coal basins: the West Basin, the East Basin, and the Priscilla Lee Basin.Newport, 38 A tunnel runs between the West Basin and the East Basin at an elevation of above sea level.Newport, 63 There are a number of pits in the area of Black Creek, some of which are up to deep. Some are former entrances to mines, while others are strip mining pits.Newport, 44 There is standing water in the underground mine workings in the creek's vicinity.Newport, 56 It drains a coal sheet known as Mine Sheet No. 1. The creek once flowed over a ledge of conglomerate of the Pottsville Formation upstream of its mouth. An 1887 book described this as \\"producing an effect especially interesting in the study of creek erosion\\". Black Creek accumulates drift to some degree as it flows along its course. However, due to the high speed of its waters, it does not deposit significant amounts of drift along its course. Geology The bedrock in the watershed of Black Creek consists of several rock formations. The oldest is the Mauch Chunk Formation of the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian eras. Younger rock formations in the watershed include the Pottsville Formation and the Llwellyn Formation, both of which date to the Pennsylvanian era. There are anthracite beds in the watershed and these beds occur within the Llwellyn Formation. The Mauch Chunk Formation was originally thick in the watershed.Newport, 32 Most of the surficial geology in the watershed of Black Creek consists of bedrock. However, glaciofluvial deposits and mining waste also occur in some areas.Newport, 41 To the west of the Lee Shaft, there are ridges of mine waste up to thick and there are a number of \\"finger-shaped\\" ridges with a thickness of in the West Basin.Newport, 43 There are five beds of coal that have been mined in the watershed of Black Creek: the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. The Lower Red Ash coal bed has a thickness of up to at the West End Mine in the watershed and the Upper Red Ash coal is up to thick.Newport, 34-35 The bedrock is exposed on the ridges in the Black Creek watershed. The exposure is due to glaciofluvial deposits disappearing due to erosion and mining.Newport, 30 There are many faults in the watershed's rocks.Newport, 40 Watershed The watershed of Black Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Shickshinny. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Nanticoke. The Susquehanna River watershed is immediately north and west of the watershed of Black Creek, while the watershed of Turtle Creek is located immediately south of the watershed. The eastern edge of the watershed (the part that was studied during the 1960s study of the watershed) includes a barrier pillar between the West End Mine and the Glen Lyon Mine. A body of water known as Stump Lake is in the creek's watershed. As of the 1960s or early 1970s, the only human inhabitants of the watershed of Black Creek reside either in the village of Mocanaqua in the southwestern part of the watershed or the small community of Lee. The watershed can be accessed from US Route 11, Pennsylvania Route 239, and a local road that runs from Mocanaqua to Glen Lyon.Newport, 18 Historically, there was a swamp at the headwaters of Black Creek. As late as the 1910s, the waters of the creek were described as coming from mountain springs and a swamp. History Black Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1169696. Coal mining was done in the watershed of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836‚Äì1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.Newport, 22 In the early 1900s, mine water and culm were discharged into Black Creek. Between 1965 and 1967, the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, the United States Bureau of Mines, the United States Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, and the Pennsylvania Department of Mines and Mineral Industries conducted a joint study on the watershed of Black Creek. The purpose of the study was to deal with water pollution due to acid mine drainage. Geological field work was carried out in the area between October 1965 and December 1965. Core and rock cuttings were done between October 1966 and June 1967.Newport, 23 However, this study was ended before all of the necessary scientific investigations were completed.Newport, 15 Biology The entire drainage basin of Black Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.

Biography Born in Avrig, Szeben County, in the Transylvania region of Austria-Hungary, his father was a Romanian Orthodox priest. He studied at the German High School in Sibiu from 1897 to 1905, followed by the Theology Faculty at Czernowitz University in Bukovina from 1905 to 1909. The same institution granted him a doctorate in 1912,\\"C√¢ndea, Romulus\\", entry in Mircea PƒÉcurariu, Dic»õionarul Teologilor Rom√¢ni, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, Bucharest, 1996 and he returned for a while to teach in Sibiu.Politics and Political Parties in Roumania, p. 420. London: International Reference Library Publishers Co., 1936. He also continued to study history and philosophy at Leipzig University, earning a doctorate in philosophy and master's degree in fine arts there in 1916. From March 1915 to October 1919, he taught church history and pedagogy at the theological seminary in Sibiu. By the time he left, both Transylvania and Bukovina had united with Romania; from 1919 to 1922, he was professor of general church history at his alma mater in what was now CernƒÉu»õi. Between 1922 and 1940, when the area was occupied by the Soviet Union, he was professor within the department of medieval, modern and contemporary world history within the Literature and Philosophy Faculty at CernƒÉu»õi. For the 1923-1924 academic year, he was dean of the faculty, while from 1925 to 1926, he was rector of the university. In 1921, C√¢ndea was involved in a student-led campaign to fire two Jewish professors, including Eugen Ehrlich, and wrote an article denouncing the \\"ferocious pan-Germanism of a Jew\\".Lucian NastasƒÉ, Antisemitismul universitar √Æn Rom√¢nia (1919-1939), p.44. Ed. Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor MinoritƒÉ»õilor Na»õionale, Cluj-Napoca, 2011, In 1929, C√¢ndea was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. He was a lay member both of the CernƒÉu»õi Archdiocese's assembly and of the national church congress. A friend and trusted advisor to Ion Nistor, his professional achievements, in the opinion of historian Lucian NastasƒÉ, did not amount to much. He also had a parallel career in politics, serving as mayor of CernƒÉu»õi from 1927 to 1929. Within the Romanian Parliament, he represented his university both in the Assembly of Deputies and in the Senate in a number of legislatures. He was a prominent member of the quasi-fascist Romanian Front, elected on Pentecost 1935 as its regional leader for Bukovina.\\"D-l Vaida- Voevod la CernƒÉu»õi.

Its purpose is to bring together clinical and research experts from across the United States to solve the most challenging medical mysteries using advanced technologies. UDN was established in 2014 with seven clinical sites located at medical institutions across the United States. As of 2019, twelve clinical sites are open. Shared resources include a central biorepository, sequencing core, metabolomics core, and animal research centers.  History  In 2008, the National Institute of Health (NIH) established the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP), with the intent to provide medical care to patients with rare diseases seeking a diagnosis and to discover new pathways and mechanisms involved in disease. At the time, ongoing genomic research and advances in DNA sequencing strengthened the potential for successes in precision medicine, providing a stimulus to the objectives of the UDP. The UDP, initially founded within the NIH Intramural Research Program, has now evolved into the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) and is funded by the NIH Common Fund. Upon its launch, the UDN consisted of the UDP, six additional clinical sites around the nation, a coordinating center, two DNA sequencing cores, a model organisms screening center, a metabolomics core, and a central biorepository. In seven years, the UDP received 2954 complete applications and evaluated 863 individuals. In September 2015, the UDN opened an online portal for patient applications, signifying the official launch of the UDN. By December 2019, 4077 patients had been referred to the UDN, and around 40% of the cases were accepted. 374 patients have received a diagnosis.  Institutes and locations  = Clinical sites = At clinical sites, accepted UDN participants undergo comprehensive medical examinations, family history studies, physical examinations, collection of biological specimens, laboratory tests, consultations, and imaging studies. Evaluations are typically conducted over a five-day period, with follow-up visits scheduled if necessary. As of 2019, twelve clinical sites are open; the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD), Harvard Medical School, Duke University in collaboration with Columbia University, Baylor College of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, University of Miami, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Utah, University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis. = Central Biorepository = The UDN Central Biorepository (UDNCB) receives roughly 1,200 biological samples each year from the combined clinical sites. Through the UDN online portal, clinical sites can view, submit, and request samples, as well as review contact information for the UDNCB. Biological samples prioritized by the UDNCB include DNA, serum, plasma, urine, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The UDNCB is located at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. = Sequencing core = The UDN sequencing core, located at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX), receives blood samples from the clinical sites and uses blood-derived DNA to conduct whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) on patients and relevant family members. = Metabolomics core = The UDN metabolomics core analyzes the biological samples collected in the UDN by performing untargeted metabolite profiling via analytical platforms such as GC-MS and NMR, targeted/quantitative metabolite profiling of key metabolites, and bioinformatics, and provides clinical interpretation to patients. The metabolomics core is located at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. = Model Organism Screening Centers = The two Model Organism Screening Centers (MOSCs) of the UDN are located at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) and Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO). These centers conduct research using the model organisms D. melanogaster (fruit fly), C. elegans (nematode worm), and D. rerio (zebrafish). By examining the effects of certain rare functional variants in these model organisms, the MOSCs investigate the contribution of patients' genetic variants to the pathogenicity of their diseases.

The first was commissioned by the Jesuit college in Antwerp and painted in 1609. It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Around 1610 Rubens composed the second version and painted the righthand half, but then left it incomplete for an unknown reason. In 1627-1628 he completed it and also modified the figure of Mary. It is now in the Rubenshuis in Antwerp, who acquired it in 1954. The two compositions are strikingly different. The Vienna painting is a fairly traditional composition. The angel Gabriel is on the right. He has just alighted on the ground, his robe still billowing from his flight, and he kneels as if in reverence or supplication. Mary stands on the left facing Gabriel, but she leans back slightly as if in surprise or alarm. The Antwerp painting is a more original composition. Mary kneels on the right; her body is turned away from Gabriel but her head is turned back toward him. Gabriel is still airborne; he reaches with his left hand toward Mary and points with his right hand toward heaven. History The Rubenshuis painting was in Madrid during Rubens' stay there from 28 August 1628 to 29 April 1629. There it was acquired by Diego Messia, marquis de Legan√©s, commander of the Spanish artillery and cavalry in the Spanish Netherlands. In 1655, the painting was in the inventory of the marquis' collection then it was left to the Altamira family, who sold it in London in 1827. It then passed through the Smith, Hamlet, earl of Caldon and Graupe collections in Britain before being acquired by the Brussels collector Gaston Duli√®re.

It was released to critical acclaim. Overview = Presentation = This is the first studio album of original material to be released by Altan in almost 3 years since the release of Gleann Nimhe ‚Äì The Poison Glen in 2012. This is also the first Altan album to feature new band member Martin Tourish on accordion. In January 2015, Altan revealed that The Widening Gyre would be the name of their new album to be released in Ireland on 20 February 2015, in the UK on 23 February 2015 and in the US on 24 February 2015. And as they borrowed the title from \\"The Second Coming\\", one of W. B. Yeats poems, the first Irishman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. Altan's official website published a presentation of their new studio album The Widening Gyre giving many details about the new album: the new musical direction taken by the band, the album recording process and the participation of numerous guest musicians as well as the titles of some of the new tracks. The very same day, on their \\"Widening Gyre\\" iTunes page, Altan revealed the titles of the 14 tracks from their new studio album and released them for sale. On 27 January 2015, on their \\"Widening Gyre\\" Compass Records page, Altan made available short snippets of their new tracks. =New musical direction= Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh introduced the music on the album as an exploration of the influence of Appalachian music on Irish music. Recorded ¬´with many good friends in the studio and Compass Records co-founder Garry West in the producer's chair steer[ing] the band in the studio to open up musically while somehow managing to help keep the integrity of Altan intact¬ª, the album is the result of a fusion ¬´of the traditional Irish music that the members of Altan are known for, namely Donegal fiddling and Gaelic singing traditions, with American roots music, particularly that of the Appalachian bluegrass fiddle¬ª and a celebration of the relationships between Altan and lifelong friends they've made through music. The Widening Gyre straddles time as it manages to remind listeners of the ancient bond between Irish and Appalachian music while at the same time breaking new ground through collaborations between masters of American roots music and Celtic music. Mair√©ad stated: ¬´The title \\"The Widening Gyre\\" appeals to us and depicts the spiral of life, widening and embracing the new. It has an innate energy. We think that idea is reflected in the album's music¬ª. The Widening Gyre is a compelling development in Altan's story proving that they are still growing as artists, even after nearly thirty years together ‚Äî the longest running lineup of founding members in Irish music. =Recording= Altan recorded the new album over ten days from 29 July to 7 August 2014 entirely in Nashville, Tennessee (at Compass Records recording studios) in order to collaborate there with longtime friends and guests, many of the roots musicians the band members have met over their thirty years together including Tim O'Brien, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Bryan Sutton and Compass co-founder Alison Brown. =Musical themes and guest musicians= The list of guests on the new album is as diverse as it is impressive: Mary Chapin Carpenter, a friend of the band since the 1990s, lent her vocals to the song \\"White Birds\\" to create a lush, meditative re-imagining of the W. B. Yeats poem about being a bird on the sea, an appropriate metaphor for a band who has musically and physically crossed the Atlantic in the making of the album.¬ª Mair√©ad introduces ¬´Eddi Reader as ¬´an amazing singer and very generous person¬ª offering her angelic backing vocals to \\"Far Beyond Carrickfinn\\" and she recalls that Altan have played concerts with Reader before and [that] they were delighted to finally have the Glasgow native join them in the studio.¬ª Altan borrowed the mournful waltz \\"No Ash Will Burn\\" from the legendary Nashville songwriter Walt Aldridge. Mairead's crystalline vocals unlock the Celtic undertones of the song while standing in stark contrast to the plaintive baritone of Bruce Molsky, a longtime friend of the band and well-known old-time fiddler and singer. The bluegrass presence shows itself most clearly on \\"Buffalo Gals\\" and \\"Thomasino (Thomas Tourish's Tune),\\" a lively fiddle song written by Altan's own Ciar√°n Tourish who's joined by bluegrass greats Alison Brown, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Todd Phillips, Bryan Sutton and Darol Anger. Mairead gushes about Darol Anger: ¬´His unique approach gives a different color to the music which opens up amazing possibilities with Irish traditional music. He is a true artist with that fiddle!¬ª She also declares Stuart Duncan to be, ¬´a fiddler's fiddler! He can create so many amazing variations on that instrument, it's unreal!¬ª Tim O'Brien duets on \\"The House Carpenter (Gypsy Davy),\\" a track which spotlights the shared musical roots of Irish and Appalachian music with references to both of these historical songs. O'Brien is best known for his work with Hot Rize, but like many dedicated bluegrass musicians, has shown a deep interest in Celtic music. Funding Altan called on Pledge Music's services in order to finance their new studio album. On 3 January 2015, Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh explained why Altan made this choice and thanked all the pledgers for helping Altan with the fundraising campaign and for bringing it to completion (reaching, at that time, 101% of goal): ¬´The music business is a changing world for professional musicians as ourselves. We depend more on live concerts to make our living. We can no longer depend on big record company funding to get our music out there, we have to do it ourselves. Now with your help we have funded our latest album which we are really happy with.¬ª She also stated that Altan have licensed the new album to Compass Records in the US, that Gary West of Compass co-produced it and that after 30 years recording studio albums, Altan ¬´have taken a new approach with this one¬ª. The Altan Pledge Music pre-order page announced that all exclusive pre-orders would be fulfilled by 17 February 2015. Apart from the new album on CD, the Altan Pledge Music page offers many original and exclusive items. Artwork In a 20 January 2015 post on her Facebook page, Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh revealed the cover of their new studio album and that the art work was done by their artist friend √âda√≠n O'Donnell who previously designed the cover of their previous album Gleann Nimhe - The Poison Glen. Critical reception On 5 February 2015, before its release, The Widening Gyre was awarded full marks by The Irish Post's columnist Joe Giltrap, describing the album as \\"a really nicely balanced album\\", \\"an album of pure quality\\", \\"a great album from a great band\\". The album received a very positive review from the New York-based Irish Voice's music critic Paul Keating, writing: \\"[Would] Altan have shared stages and off-hours sparks with a wealth of kindred musical spirits from both sides of the Atlantic and the Irish Sea [over the past thirty years], the recording shows that depth and creativity with lots of new stuff to savor and some reinventions of recognizable material as well, interpreted by some of the best musicians you can find in roots music.\\". The Widening Gyre received a four star album review (out of 5) from The Irish Times's reviewer Siobhan Long, stating that Altan \\"have reinvigorated their sound in the process of [recording in] Nashville with newcomer Martin Tourish on piano accordion [and] an all-star cast [of Appalachian bluegrass musicians]\\". The Arts Desk website's music critic Peter Quinn, stated: \\"Listeners looking for the uniquely driving tune sets that Altan are famous for have plenty to get their teeth into\\", describing The Widening Gyre as \\"an absolute treasure trove\\" and N√≠ Mhaonaigh's voice as \\"indescribably beautiful\\", \\"songs [occupying] a special place on any Altan album\\", adding: \\"N√≠ Mhaonaigh's soaring, soul- stirring vocals on \\"Far Beyond Carrickfinn\\" [...] is one of the most touching things you'll hear this year\\". The Telegraph gave it 4 stars (out of 5), describing it as \\"a wonderful mix of Irish and Appalachian music.\\" On 9 March 2015, The Widening Gyre was honoured \\"album of the week\\" on RT√â radio 1. PopMatters's gave it a rating of 8 stars out of 10. Music critic Lee Zimmerman, stating: \\"The Widening Gyre is a defining moment for Altan. [...] [It] is much more than a mere scholarly treatise. The energy and enthusiasm are palatable, and there's a sense of celebration that echoes throughout. [...] Altan has made the kind of album that defines them as distinctive.\\" Irish Music Magazine's critic Eileen McCabe, stated: \\"Altan are just at the start of their next chapter and having shown their inimitable metal with The Widening Gyre; they have set the standard at an all time high.\\" Folkworks reviewer Anya Sturm, stated: \\"Altan's new CD The Widening Gyre is a fantastic collection of traditional Gaelic songs mixed in with Irish jam regulars. The band is joined by many special guests in this collection of upbeat lively jam tunes as well as slower songs sung by Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh. [...] This CD is a great mixture of what you would expect from a traditional Irish band combined with American influences.\\" In the May‚ÄìJune 2015 issue of (French magazine) Trad' Mag, folk critic Philippe Cousin awarded The Widening Gyre full marks (giving the album a \\"Bravo!!!\\" award), stating: \\"If Donegal is still part of it here, bluegrass colours dot here and there some of the fourteen tracks of this superb album. [...] Throughout the album, American and Irish tunes intertwine with each other and lay down a wonderful template sublimated by Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh's crystalline voice and her fellow musicians' instruments. Once again, a nice piece of work.\\" In December 2015, The Telegraph's culture editor Martin Chilton chose The Widening Gyre as one of the 70 best folk music albums of the year 2015.  Commercial performance  On 7 March 2015, The Widening Gyre entered the Billboard Top Ten World Music Albums Charts at #5 (its peak position ever) and hold #5 for six consecutive weeks.

The Maggie in the title is Maggie Moore, who makes, apparently, really nice pancakes. This version was learned from the wonderful fiddling of Catriona MacDonald, Alasdair Fraser and all the students at the Valley of the Moon Fiddle School in California. *\\"P√≠obaire an Ch√©ide\\" is yet another setting of this fine Donegal reel which came from the playing of the great Donegal fiddle player, John Doherty. *\\"The Friel Deal\\" is a reel composed by Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh for the musical Friel family: Clare, Anna, S√≠le, John and Sheila Friel of Doire na Mainse√°r and Fanad in Co. Donegal and Glasgow. 2\\\\. \\"No Ash Will Burn\\" (song) *A popular old timey song from the pen of Walt Aldridge. We heard it first from the beautiful singing of Carol Elizabeth Jones on the Renegades CD. This song came together in the studio during the recording session in Nashville and we got our friend Bruce Molsky to sing a verse and play his fiddle on it. Jenee Fleenor added some glorious backing vocals. 3\\\\. \\"Buffalo Gals/Leather Britches(Lord McDonald's Reel)/Leslie's Reel\\" *Darol Anger, Todd Phillips, Alison Brown and ourselves were casually playing tunes in the studio when we came up with this selection. This track embodies the idea of this album: how the tunes travelled across the Atlantic to the Appalachian Mountains and how we can still find tunes which we have in common. 4\\\\. \\"M√° Th√©ann T√∫ 'un Aonaigh\\" (amhr√°n/song) *A song (in Gaelic) of sound advice for a young man heading off into the world. It advises him to put his best foot forward in whatever his endeavours may be: whether going to the fair with his sheep or taking his loved one out, to concentrate fully on his actions and manners! This melody is from a field recording of R√≥ise na nAmhr√°n of Arranmore Island of the Northwest coast of Donegal, recorded in the 1950s. R√≥ise na nAmhr√°n is a nickname of the singer which means \\"Rose of the Songs\\". As R√≥ise Bean Mhic Grianna (Mrs Rose Green), she was visited by Radio √âireann in May 1953, when she recorded some fifty songs at a single sitting. On stage on 6 March 2015 at The Barns at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Virginia Mair√©ad roughly translated the song's title as ¬´Everything you do in life, do it well.¬ª 5\\\\. \\"A tune For Mair√©ad and Anna N√≠ Mhaonaigh\\" (slow tune) *D√°ith√≠ Sproule composed this back in the eighties for a birthday celebration in honour of Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh and her sister, Anna N√≠ Mhaonaigh. He recorded it first on a CD with Liz Carroll ‚Äì great to hear it here played by the whole band with lovely parts from Stuart Duncan and Natalie Haas. 6\\\\. \\"White Birds\\" (song) *This evocative poem was written by the renowned Irish poet W. B. Yeats early in his career. He wrote it the day after the great love of his life, Maud Gonne, rejected his first marriage proposal, after expressing that she would rather be a seagull than any other bird. Yeats, feeling rejected, imagines in the poem that as gulls they could both flee and escape reality, and live together forever. Here, we have asked Mary Chapin Carpenter to share the beautiful lyrics, for which our friend Fiona Black has composed the music. 7\\\\. \\"The Tin Key/Sam Kelly's Jig/The Gravediggers (Jigs)\\" *Three jigs composed by Mark Kelly, inspired by the Donegal fiddling tradition. 8\\\\. \\"C√∫irt Robin Finley/Moladh Shliabh Maoineach\\" (amhr√°n/song) *A love song in praise of a mountain in Co. Donegal. It is here you will find happiness, health, love and gold. In other words, a Utopia. We are still trying to find this mountain! Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh collected this song in the 1980s from a lovely singer, M√°ire Rua N√≠ Mhaigh, who lived in an area near Ballybofey called the Croaghs, a mountainous Gaelic-speaking region. 9\\\\. \\"The House Carpenter (Gypsy Davy)\\" (song) *Another great version of the well documented \\"The House Carpenter\\", which has travelled the Atlantic and can be found both in America and in Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. This particular version also echoes The Raggle Taggle Gypsy and Cuach Mo Lon Dubh Bu√≠, where the exotic traveller entices a young wife away from her husband to her dismay. Julee Glaub Weem is the source for this unusual version, and she kindly joins us here on backing vocals along with the great Tim O'Brien exchanging a verse and playing his mandolin. 10\\\\. \\"Samhradh (Slow Reel)/Aniar Aduaidh (Jig)/The Donegal Jig\\" *Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh composed the first slow reel \\"Samhradh\\" (\\"Summer\\" in Irish Gaelic) as she waited for the band to arrive at her house on the first day of rehearsals for this new album ‚Äì a beautiful sunny day on 5 June 2014. *The title of the jig, \\"Aniar Aduaidh\\", can mean two things: \\"northwest\\" or it can also mean to startle or to surprise someone. *\\"The Donegal Jig\\" composed by Martin Tourish reminiscing the excitement of New Year's Eve in Co. Donegal. 11\\\\. \\"Lurgy Streams\\" (song) *The \\"Lurgy Stream\\" takes its name from a river in Donegal and mentions several places in the eastern part of the county. It is quite a popular song, sung to different melodies. Although D√°ith√≠ Sproule already had two airs to it, one from his father, Robert Sproule, and the other from the great Derry singer, Kevin Mitchell, he decided to put a melody of his own to the words, and that is the version Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh sings here. 12\\\\. \\"The Triple T\\" (a.k.a. \\"Thomas Tourish's Tune\\") *Written by Ciar√°n Tourish for his son, Thomas. His older brother, Richie, came up with the title. As the record was recorded in Nashville, the tune was written with a bluegrass feel in mind. Guest soloists are Alison Brown (banjo), Jerry Douglas (dobro), Bryan Sutton (guitar), Darol Anger (fiddle), Sam Bush (mandolin) and Stuart Duncan (fiddle). 13\\\\. \\"Far beyond Carrickfinn\\" (song) *This song was composed by Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh's friends, Ian Smith and Enda Cullen, giving her perspective on the loss of her father, Proinsias √ì Maonaigh (Francie Mooney). On the night of his death, a shooting star overhead felt like a signal of hope, leading to the line ¬´Stars lead the way, as your journey begins.¬ª The wonderfully talented Eddi Reader joins us on this song. The male chorus of Altan sing Gaelic lines which Francie wrote‚Ä¶ ¬´√Åit sh√©imh gan sm√°l‚Äîsl√°n sl√°n go f√≥ill‚Äîmacalla do ghl√≥r ar feochan na gaoithe.¬ª ¬´A glentle unblemished place‚Äîgoodbye for now‚Äîthe echo of your voice on the breath of the breeze.¬ª 14\\\\. \\"The Road Home\\" (slow house) *Inspired by Ireland's rugged West coast, Martin Tourish composed this piece in the Summer of 2003 on the road from Milltown Malbay to Donegal following the annual Willie Clancy Summer School. Live performances Prior to the release of The Widening Gyre, Altan had already played live in concert (at least) one track from the new album, \\"The Tin Key/Sam Kelly's Jig/The Gravediggers (Jigs)\\", during (at least) one of their 2014 shows (i.e. their last show of 2014: on 5 December 2014 at The Great British Folk Festival in Skegness, Lincolnshire, UK). On 22 February 2015 at West Virginia's Culture Center Theater in Charleston, West Virginia, Altan as a trio (including Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, Ciaran Tourish and D√°ith√≠ Sproule) performed live for the NPR Music's Mountain Stage radio show a special set of 5 tracks including \\"The House Carpenter (Gypsy Davy)\\" from the new album. This 26-minute live set was broadcast on 5 May 2015 on the web edition of the radio show. As an example, on 25 August 2015 at the East Belfast Arts Festival, Stormont Hotel, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK, Altan performed live no less than 10 songs (out of 14) from The Widening Gyre: *\\"Maggie's Pancakes/P√≠obaire an Ch√©ide/The Friel Deal (Reels)\\" *\\"No Ash Will Burn\\" *\\"M√° Th√©ann T√∫ 'un Aonaigh\\" *\\"White Birds\\" *\\"The Tin Key/Sam Kelly's Jig/The Gravediggers (Jigs)\\" *\\"The House Carpenter (Gypsy Davy)\\" *\\"Samhradh (Slow Reel)/Aniar Aduaidh (Jig)/The Donegal Jig\\" *\\"The Triple T\\" (a.k.a. \\"Thomas Tourish's Tune\\") *\\"Far Beyond Carrickfinn\\" *\\"The Road Home\\"  Notes  References External links * The Widening Gyre Official recording page * Official Altan website * Official Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh website Category:Altan (band) albums Category:2015 albums ","title":"The Widening Gyre (album)"},{"id":"45224640","text":"thumb The Descent from the Cross is a painting by Peter Paul Rubens, produced around 1616-1617 for the chapel of the Capuchin convent in Lille.

The Wolf and Fox Hunt is the first painting by Rubens when he created a market for a new form of art. This is one of the many paintings of very large hunting scenes painted on a canvas. The painting was originally trimmed from the top and the left side as it was too big and it would not fit in any of the houses of the princes. The wolves in the painting are his own creation and work but overall the painting was completed with assistance. This painting was considered to be a modern replacement for tapestries.

On her deathbed in 1950, Alice Garoute asked that flowers be placed on her grave the day Haitian women would finally be able to vote. She may have attended the first meeting of the Inter-American Commission of Women (IACW) in Havana in February 1930. The IACW was in charge of investigating the legal status of women in Latin-America and is credited for being the first governmental organization in the world to be founded for the express purpose of advocating women's issues. Biography Alice Th√©zan was born in 1874 in Cap-Ha√Øtien, in the northern part of Haiti. Her parents were part of the rebellion against president Lysius Salomon and as such, the family was exiled to Kingston, Jamaica. In her teens, when the family returned to Haiti, she was married briefly and had two infants who died. Little is known of the first husband or the courtship of her second husband. What is known is that Th√©zan was living in Port-au-Prince, attorney Auguste Garoute from the town of J√©r√©mie was a recent widower with young children, and the couple married at the end of the nineteenth century.\\"Sanders (2013)\\", pp 43-45 During the first decade of the twentieth century, Alice and Th√©r√®se Hudicourt, wife of attorney Pierre Hudicourt, and an intellectual and Marxist, formed a library book club for an elite group of educated women where they read books in both English and French including novels and political materials. They then discussed the topics from feminism to Marxism, leading to a growing awareness of women's lack of civil rights in Haitian society.\\"Sanders (2013)\\", p 49 This heightened awareness and the US military occupation, which had begun in 1915 and by 1920 had been exposed as a reign of sexual assault on Haitian women\\"Sanders (2013)\\", pp 56-57 caused social divisions to evaporate in an effort to protect themselves.Sanders (2013)\\", pp 59-60 Garoute, Hudicourt, Eug√©ne Malbranche-Sylvain and other women of the social elite organized the Union Patriotique with the goal of sending a delegation to Washington, D.C. to demand that the US military be controlled.Sanders (2013)\\", p 60 When they had finally collected enough funds to send a delegation in 1921, President Harding and the Congress were unresponsive, but meetings with W.

These US women saw enfranchisement as a means of ending their own sexual exploitation and recognized that sexual violence was an international problem.Sanders (2013)\\", p 67 Ligue F√©minine d'Action Sociale Against this backdrop of ongoing women's opposition to the US military occupation of Haiti (1915‚Äì1934) she was among the founders in 1934 of the Ligue F√©minine d'Action Sociale (aka Feminine League for Social Action) and its president starting in 1941. She made several impassioned and well-documented speeches in the National Assembly for full equality for women buttressing her arguments with the various conventions signed by Haiti in support of women's rights. Besides Alice Garoute, the League's members included: Madeleine Sylvain, Fernande Bellegarde, Th√©r√®se Hudicourt, Alice T√©ligny Mathon, Marie-Th√©r√®se Colimon and Marie-Th√©r√®se Poitevien many of whom were teachers of elite social extraction. The League was banned by the government two months after its founding. The league's goals were supported by the political left and included: more schools for girls, equality for women in family law, equal pay for equal work, voting rights for women, free labor unions and a labor ministry with a women's bureau. The league was reestablished when it agreed to study its goals instead of immediately implementing them. The league is credited for the granting of voting rights for women in 1957.  The First Congress of Haitian Women  The First Congress of Haitian women was organized by the League on April 10‚Äì14, 1950 under the watchful eye of its honorary president, First Lady Lucienne Heurtelou Estim√©. Alice Garoute offered a particularly impassioned address about the state of education of Haitian women during which she argued that those women who had been schooled since 1940 in the three private schools that accepted them had done as well as men. She also deplored that women in Haiti during her time were treated as poorly as during Napoleon's Code Noir (aka Napoleon's Black Code): \\"like children and the mentally ill\\". At the Congress' closing ceremony Alice Garoute and other notable women lodged an official list of their demands.

It is the main headquarters library of the Monarch Library System, consisting of libraries in Sheboygan, Ozaukee, and Washington Counties.  History  James H. Mead, from Montpelier, Vermont, came to Sheboygan in 1856. With his father-in-law, he founded and obtained a charter for the German Bank (later known as Security First National bank, then acquired by First Wisconsin Bank in 1985, eventually becoming a part of US Bank after Firstar's purchase of that bank in 2001). At the time of his death in 1891, he was president of the German Bank and the Crocker Chair Company. He left $10,000 to the First Congregational Church and $20,000 to the City of Sheboygan to be used to provide places \\"for the amusement and literary culture of young men,\\" in the case of the gift to the city, for a public library. After being contained within several storefronts (including the Foeste Building), with the assistance of funds from Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie library effort, the library was moved into its own dedicated building in 1904, located at the corner of N. 7th Street and New York Avenue.  Library branches  During the early 1950s, the library built two branch libraries. Although Sheboygan had had many different branches over the years, these were the first constructed to serve as library branches. The first was the Frank Stone branch attached to Cooper Elementary School on the city's north side. Frank Stone was the first librarian of the Sheboygan Library Association. The second branch was named after Charles E. Broughton and was attached to Wilson Elementary School on the city's south side. = Current location = Early in 1964, the library board agreed that a new or expanded library building was needed and money for planning was requested of, and granted by, the Common Council in the next annual budget. A bond issue, containing $2.3 million for the construction of a new library, was approved by the Common Council in 1970. The city at this time was acquiring land for Plaza 8. The city planner at that time reported that some of this land, located at North 8th Street and New York Avenue, could be used as a library site. The new and current 64,000 square- foot library opened in 1974. Before the opening, hundreds of high school students lugged 150,000 books from the old library to the new, one block to the west. Units of the Wisconsin National Guard and the Army Reserve moved heavy equipment with their trucks. The original design of the library was of a Brutalist structure, with a large amount of vaulted concrete and brickwork defining the interior structure of the library. The main library took up the second floor, with the children's room on the first floor, and services including circulation, administration and the headquarters for the Eastern Shores Library System in an exposed basement which was landscaped on a slope which came down from Plaza 8's water feature. The Carnegie building was then used for the city's health department and county human services until the 90s, when the John Michael Kohler Arts Center acquired the building and disassembled the interior, retaining the facade as a modern 'ruin', with the former building footprint containing gardens. In April 1987, the city had planned to put downtown including Plaza 8, under one roof. Developer John Livesey proposed a $100 million enclosed shopping and office complex, to be called City Center. The only buildings that would have remained in the City Center site were the Prange's store, Mead Public Library and Trinity Lutheran Church. Most of the other buildings would have been demolished by the city including the First Wisconsin Sheboygan Bank (now the U.S. Bank). In 1992, the process of removing Plaza 8 from the block between the Mead Public Library and Prange's across the street was completed, though due to the water feature and the Prange's frontage, the restored North 8th Street was a compressed two-lane road through the library block. From 1996 until 1998, the current library building underwent an expansion which changed the building's front from North 8th Street to Wisconsin Avenue. The Brutalist features of the building were considerably lightened with dropped ceilings and brighter lighting, with the children's room moved to a newly built third floor with panoramic views of the surroundings of Sheboygan. A quiet study room was placed atop the new second floor frontage, and fiction and audiovisual services were moved down to the first floor. The library's check-out system also changed considerably, from an early light pen and RFID system to a current all-RFID system which now uses several self-checkout kiosks, freeing up library staff to provide other services. Computer services, which in the 1980s were limited to Infotrac terminals, have also widened considerably to a number of internet terminals throughout the building and the move of the card catalog system to a fully web-based system shared with its sister libraries in the Monarch system.

Twenty-one others, all on the ground, were also injured. Background Los Llanos Air Base is the venue of NATO's Tactical Leadership Program (TLP), a regular series of training exercises for personnel from ten NATO member air forces. In January 2015, during TLP2015-1, several NATO air forces deployed aircraft to the base, including four F-16 Block 50 fighter aircraft of the Hellenic Air Force's 341st Squadron, supported by 41 pilots and technicians from the 111th Combat Wing, based at Nea Anchialos Air Base. Accident On 26 January 2015, one of the Greek F-16s crashed into other aircraft at the base just after takeoff, causing an explosion which killed 9 people. A total of five aircraft on the ground were damaged or destroyed, including two Italian AMXs, two French Alpha Jets, and one French Mirage 2000. Those killed included the two Greek crew members of the F-16 and eight French personnel on the ground. 21 individuals were injured, six of them severely. The following day, a French airman who was severely burned in the accident died, bringing the death toll to eleven. In addition to the loss of personnel, the crash resulted in the write-off of two Dassault Mirage 2000D fighters and two Alpha Jet trainers of the French Air Force. Two of its Dassault Rafales were also severely damaged. Investigation Initial findings were that a technical fault developed on board the F-16 during take-off, and the two crew members had tried to eject.

He designed and built several medical facilities. Kellogg was involved over the controversy about which day should be observed as the Sabbath on Tonga, which lies east of the 180¬∞ meridian but west of the International Date Line. Early years Merritt Gardner Kellogg was born in Hadley, Massachusetts on the Connecticut River on 28 March 1832. He attended the Battle Creek Sabbath School. He converted to Seventh-day Adventism at the age of twenty. Kellogg was the stepbrother of John Harvey Kellogg. He married Louisa Rawson (1832‚Äì94) and they had a child Charles Merritt Kellogg (1856‚Äì89). The Kelloggs made the westward journey to California in 1859, where they were probably the first Seventh-day Adventists in the state. In 1861 Kellogg gave a series of Bible lectures in San Francisco in which he converted fourteen people. In 1867 he returned east to New Jersey to take a short course in medicine at Trall's Hygieo-Thereapeutic College. During his return journey to California he attended the SDA General Conference session on 1868 and asked that the church send evangelists to the West Coast. Back in California he assisted the evangelists John Loughborough and Daniel Bourdeau, mostly talking on topics related to health. During a smallpox epidemic in 1870 he gave water treatments and diet to his patients, of whom ten out of eleven survived. This earned him a high reputation. In the summer of 1877 Kellogg was asked to help look after patients at a San Francisco hydrotherapy center in exchange for room and board. The owner, Barlow J. Smith, sold out after five months and opened a retreat in Rutherford, in the Napa Valley. He invited Kellogg to come to Rutherford as a house physician. A patient there encouraged Kellogg to establish his own health resort, and helped arrange investors. Kellog began work on a site near St. Helena, California. Ellen G. White came to inspect the property, and endorsed the decision. The road and building were completed by the end of May 1878 and the first patients arrived on 7 June 1878. The health center was an immediate success. Kellogg left when well-trained doctors arrived. The Rural Health Retreat later became the St. Helena Hospital. South Pacific In 1893 Kellogg was sent as a medical missionary to the South Pacific in the second voyage of the Pitcairn. The ship carried books giving practical medical advice, which would be sold, and Kellogg would give lectures and treatments at the ship's places of call. The ship sailed from San Francisco on 17 January 1893 and reached Pitcairn on 19 February 1893. She went on to Tahiti, Huahine and Raiatea Islands. The Pitcairn stopped at Rurutu Island, Mangaia Island, Rarotonga and Niue Island. Kellogg treated many sick people at each island. At Niue Kellogg observed that Christianity had been a corrupting influence. Spies reported misdemeanors to judges, who imposed a fine that was split between the judge and the spy. Kellogg wrote, \\"The result of this system is to cause the people to fear the law instead of fearing God, and as they have but a very dim idea of the object and power of the gospel, they learn to practice deceit so as to avoid detection and punishment.\\" The Pitcairn bypassed Vava ªu Island, Tonga, where there was a measles epidemic, to avoid being quarantined. She sailed via Fiji and Norfolk Island to New Zealand. Kellogg stayed in Australia for a while, where he made a second marriage to a woman from Broken Hill, New South Wales. His wife was Eleanor Kathleen Nolan (1874‚Äì1919). They had two children, Muriel and Merritt. Kellogg was considered for an exploratory journey along the coast of Australia and on to New Caledonia in 1894, but it was decided later that year that New Caledonia was \\"not very promising\\". He returned to the South Pacific with his wife, and reached Apia in Western Samoa in 1896. There he helped Dr. Frederick Braucht build a two-story sanitarium inland from the beachfront. This was the first such institution in the South Pacific. The Pitcairn found Kellog and his wife on Samoa when it visited on its fifth voyage in 1896. In September 1897 Kellogg and his wife Eleanor Nolan Kellogg came to Tongatapu, the main island in Tonga, to assist with the medical work of the Seventh-day Adventist Church of Tonga. He built a timber home at Magaia that was long used as the home of the mission superintendent. In Tonga Kellogg found difficulty earning a living as a doctor, in part due to competition from a government doctor who did not charge for his services. His son Merritt Jr. was born in Nuku ªalofa in 1899. International Date Line controversy Kellogg and fellow-missionaries Edwin Butz and Edward Hilliard debated which was the correct day to observe the Sabbath in Tonga. The practice on board the Pitcairn had been to change days at the 180¬∞ meridian. Islands such as Samoa and Tonga were well to the east of this line, so the missionaries observed the Sabbath on the day sequence of the Western Hemisphere. However, the Tonga islands used the same days as New Zealand and Australia, so the missionaries were observing the seventh-day Sabbath on the day the secular authorities called Sunday. The tract by Adventist John N. Andrews called The Definitive Seventh Day (1871) recommended using a Bering Strait date line. If this line were taken as the IDL, the Tonga Adventists were celebrating the Sabbath on the wrong day. However, an international conference in 1884 had established the International Date Line (IDL) at 180¬∞ while allowing for local adjustments. The Tonga missionaries sent letters to church leaders in Tahiti, Australia and the US asking for advice, and even asked Ellen G. White for her opinion. Replies were contradictory. It was not until 1901 that White sent a letter to Kellogg in which she ruled decisively in favor of the 180¬∞ meridien. Later years The Kelloggs transferred to Australia in May 1900. They settled in Sydney, where Kellogg drew up the plans for the Wahroonga Sanitarium, and in 1901 supervised its construction. This is now the Sydney Adventist Hospital. Kellogg returned to California in 1903 and due to poor health lived in retirement. He was suffering from hearing and vision problems. He lived the last nineteen years of his life in Healdsburg, California. Kellogg was the older brother, or half- brother, of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, who was expelled from the Battle Creek church on suspicion of unorthodox views and suspect practices at his sanitarium. Kellogg defended his brother in a 33-page essay he wrote in 1908. Both of Kellogg's children by his second wife died in 1909, and his wife died in 1919. Merritt Gardner Kellogg died in 1922.

It is currently home of Siracusa football team. The stadium was built in 1930 and was inaugurated in 1932. The stadium is named after Nicola de Simone, a Siracusa player who died in 1979 in a game against Palma Campania. The stadium is located in the center of Siracusa's historic district, near the Basilica of Santa Lucia and the Shrine of Our Lady of Tears. History Stadio Nicola de Simone was originally built in 1930, during the years of fascism in Italy, as can be seen in symbols which are still visible in the stadium's entrance hall. Its original capacity was around 8,000 spectators. The size was later brought down to its current capacity after numerous anti-violence laws were passed in Sicily, despite that after being moved up to Serie C, the stadium should have supported around 12,000 spectators. During the season of 1994‚Äì95, a fence was built between the field and the spectators, which further limited the stadium's attendance. The stadium underwent minor renovations to its locker rooms and stands in 2001, which included the installation of a water system and of blue seats (to match Siracusa's colors) in the grandstand. During this renovation, the stadium also added a west curve of seats, which brought the capacity back up to its current number. In 2006, the stadium underwent further minor renovations, including the installation of lights, the installation of a sound system, and the installation of new grass. Along with the renovation, a synthetic turf field was built nearby for practices and the youth squad, named after former Siracusa manager Paul Quattropani. In 2007, the grandstand was named after former Siracusa striker Corrado Siringo, who died in a car accident that year. In December 2008, the shelter over the grandstand was demolished.

Nadine Rodriguez and her unmarried female partner of 21 years applied to the Housing Allocation Committee for approval of a joint tenancy in government-owned housing. The Committee had a policy of only approving joint tenancies in cases where a couple were married or were unmarried partners with a child in common. Rodriguez and her partner's application was turned down because they did not meet the criteria. The Court of Appeal of Gibraltar held that the policy was not unconstitutionally discriminatory. The JCPC held that the government's policy was discriminatory and thereby violated the Constitution of Gibraltar. The discriminatory impact was greater upon same-sex partners than other unmarried couples since same-sex partners were prohibited from marrying and cannot have biological children in common. The JCPC rejected Gibraltar's argument that the policy protected marriage and children, because denying benefits to those who cannot marry does not protect those who can. The JCPC emphasised that the decision did not mean that Gibraltar was obliged to introduce same-sex marriage or same-sex civil partnerships.

Nowadays it runs approximately 280m between Westgate Square and the Old Green Interchange (facing Newport Castle). Description fa√ßade of the former main Post Office, High Street Newport's High Street leads away southwest from Newport Castle and Newport Bridge through the city centre, bending to head south approximately four-fifths of the way along its route. Landmarks along the street include the Kings Head Hotel building, the facade of the Old Post Office (now disguising a multi-storey carpark), the Olde Murenger's Pub, Newport Market and Newport Arcade. Since the early 2010s the street has undergone re-paving and other improvements. History Newport, in 1810, was described as \\"consisting principally of one street, built partly on the banks of the Usk\\" and this description is corroborated by the 1750 map of Newport. High Street led to what is now Stow Hill and eventually to the town church, St Woolos. The town once had town walls with three gates, the middle one was in the centre of the High Street and was finally demolished in 1808. The High Street was widened in 1809 and, in 1810, the development of Commercial Street began, spreading the town west. A tax collector lived on the High Street to collect money to pay for repairs to the walls though the Murenger's House (a 'murenger' was a tax collector) was demolished in 1816. A pub, Ye Olde Murenger House, still exists on High Street, claiming to be Newport's oldest pub operating since 1530 (it was elaborated with faux jetties at some point during the 20th-century). A Post Office was built on High Street in 1844, rebuilt in 1907 and reconstructed in 2001 (according to the blue plaque on the building). Market Arcade A market took place in a block on the east side of the High Street from 1817. It was expanded in 1865 and, in May 1889 an even larger indoor market was opened, with a 58m central hall. The High Street facade of the building dates from the early 1900s, in Portland stone. Two covered shopping arcades run off High Street, both probably by local architects Habershon & Fawckner and both now Grade II listed. Newport Arcade to the west dates from 1893 and Market Arcade, to the east, dates from circa 1900. The High Street became a one-way system for motorised vehicles in 1949. 21st century In the 2010s the High Street underwent regeneration and pedestrianisation as part of a wider ¬£2.6 million project to improve the city centre shopping experience.

The settings of nautical fiction vary greatly, including merchant ships, liners, naval ships, fishing vessels, life boats, etc., along with sea ports and fishing villages. When describing nautical fiction, scholars most frequently refer to novels, novellas, and short stories, sometimes under the name of sea novels or sea stories. These works are sometimes adapted for the theatre, film and television. The development of nautical fiction follows with the development of the English language novel and while the tradition is mainly British and North American, there are also significant works from literatures in Japan, France, Scandinavia,Ray Taras, \\"A Conversation with Carsten Jensen\\", World Literature Today, May 2011: and other Western traditions. Though the treatment of themes and settings related to the sea and maritime culture is common throughout the history of western literature, nautical fiction, as a distinct genre, was first pioneered by James Fenimore Cooper (The Pilot, 1824) and Frederick Marryat (Frank Mildmay, 1829 and Mr Midshipman Easy 1836) at the beginning of the 19th century. There were 18th century and earlier precursors that have nautical settings, but few are as richly developed as subsequent works in this genre. The genre has evolved to include notable literary works like Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851), Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim (1899‚Äì1900), popular fiction like C.S. Forester's Hornblower series (1937‚Äì67), and works by authors that straddle the divide between popular and literary fiction, like Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series (1970‚Äì2004). Because of the historical dominance of nautical culture by men, they are usually the central characters, except for works that feature ships carrying women passengers. For this reason, nautical fiction is often marketed for men. Nautical fiction usually includes distinctive themes, such as a focus on masculinity and heroism, investigations of social hierarchies, and the psychological struggles of the individual in the hostile environment of the sea. Stylistically, readers of the genre expect an emphasis on adventure, accurate representation of maritime culture, and use of nautical language. Works of nautical fiction often include elements overlapping with other genres, including historical fiction, adventure fiction, war fiction, children's literature, fantasy stories, travel narratives (such as the Robinsonade), the social problem novel and psychological fiction. Definition J. M. W. Turner, The Battle of Trafalgar (circa. 1806). Turner's seascapes reflect the Romantic movement's new attitude to the sea What constitutes nautical fiction or sea fiction, and their constituent naval, nautical or sea novels, depends largely on the focus of the commentator. Conventionally sea fiction encompasses novels in the vein of Marryat, Conrad, Melville, Forester and O'Brian: novels which are principally set on the sea, and immerse the characters in nautical culture. Typical sea stories follow the narrative format of \\"a sailor embarks upon a voyage; during the course of the voyage he is tested ‚Äì by the sea, by his colleagues or by those that he encounters upon another shore; the experience either makes him or breaks him\\".Peck, pp. 165-185. Some scholars chose to expand the definition of what constitutes nautical fiction. However, these are inconsistent definitions: some like Bernhard Klein, choose to expand that definition into a thematic perspective, he defines his collection \\"Fictions of the Sea\\" around a broader question of the \\"Britain and the Sea\\" in literature, which comes to include 16th and 17th maritime instructional literature, and fictional depictions of the nautical which offer lasting cultural resonance, for example Milton's Paradise Lost and Coleridge's \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". Choosing not to fall into this wide of a definition, but also opting to include more fiction than just that which is explicitly about the sea, John Peck opts for a broader maritime fiction, which includes works like Jane Austen's Mansfield Park (1814) and George Eliot's Daniel Deronda (1876), that depict cultural situations dependent on the maritime economy and culture, without explicitly exploring the naval experience.Peck, \\"Introduction\\", pp. 1-9. However, as critic Luis Iglasius notes, when defending the genesis of the sea novel genre by James Fenimore Cooper, expanding this definition includes work \\"tend[ing] to view the sea from the perspective of the shore\\" focusing on the effect of a nautical culture on the larger culture or society ashore or focusing on individuals not familiar with nautical life. This article focuses on the sea/nautical novel and avoids broader thematic discussions of nautical topics in culture. In so doing, this article highlights what critics describe as the more conventional definition for the genre, even when they attempt to expand its scope. History Sea narratives have a long history of development, arising from cultures with genres of adventure and travel narratives that profiled the sea and its cultural importance, for example Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, the Old English poem The Seafarer, The Icelandic Saga of Eric the Red (c.1220‚Äì1280), or early European travel narratives like Richard Hakluyt's (c. 1552‚Äì1616) Voyages (1589).Robert Foulke, The Sea Voyage Narrative. (New York: Routledge, 2002). Then during the 18th century, as Bernhard Klein notes in defining \\"sea fiction\\" for his scholarly collection on sea fiction, European cultures began to gain an appreciation of the \\"sea\\" through varying thematic lenses. First because of the economic opportunities brought by the sea and then through the influence of the Romantic movement. As early as 1712 Joseph Addison identified \\"the sea as an archetype of the Sublime in nature: 'of all the objects that I have ever seen, there is none which affects my imagination as much as the sea or ocean' \\".Essay on the sea in the Spectator 1712, quoted by Jonathan Raban, \\"Introduction\\" to The Oxford Book of the Sea. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 8. Later in this century Samuel Taylor Coleridge's narrative poem Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798), developed the idea of the ocean as \\"realm of unspoiled nature and a refuge from the perceived threats of civilization\\".Klein, Bernhard, \\"Introduction:Britain in the Sea\\" in Klein, Fictions of the Sea, pp. 1-10. However, it is Byron \\"who has taken most of the credit for inventing the nineteenth-century sea, in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812‚Äì16): :There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, :There is a rapture on the lonely shore, :There is society where none intrudes, :By the deep Sea and music in its roar.Jonathan Raban, \\"Introduction\\" to The Oxford Book of the Sea, p. 14. =Early sea novels= A distinct sea novel genre, which focuses on representing nautical culture exclusively, did not gain traction until the early part of the 19th century, however, works dealing with life at sea were written in the 18th century. This includes works dealing with piracy, such as Daniel Defoe's The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (1720), and A General History of the Pyrates (1724), a work which contains biographies of several notorious English pirates such as Blackbeard and Calico Jack.A general history of the robberies & murders of the most notorious pirates. By Charles Johnson Introduction and commentary by David Cordingly. Conway Maritime Press (2002). Tobias Smollett's The Adventures of Roderick Random, published in 1748, is a picaresque novel partially based on Smollett's experience as a naval-surgeon's mate in the British Navy. =19th century= Jonathan Raban suggests that it was the Romantic movement, and especially Byron, which made \\"the sea the proper habit for aspiring authors\\", including the two most prominent early sea fiction writers James Fenimore Cooper and Captain Frederick Marryat,The Oxford Book of the Sea.(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 16. both of whose maritime adventure novels began to define generic expectations about such fiction. Critic Margaret Cohen describes Cooper's The Pilot as the first sea novel and Marryat's adaptation of that style, as continuing to \\"pioneer\\" the genre. Critic Luis Iglesias says that novels and fiction that involved the sea before these two authors \\"tend to view the sea from the perspective of the shore\\"focusing on the effect of a nautical culture on the larger culture or society ashore or individuals not familiar with nautical life; by example Iglesias points to how Jane Austen's novels don't represent the genre, because, though the sea plays a prominent part in their plots, it keeps actual sea-culture at a \\"peripheral presence\\"; similarly, Iglesias describes earlier English novels like Robinson Crusoe (1719), Moll Flanders (1722), or Roderick Random (1748) as populating the naval world with characters unfamiliar with the sea to better understand land- bound society, not fulfilling the immersive generic expectations of nautical fiction. From the development of the genre's motifs and characteristics in works like Cooper's and Marryat's, a number of notable European novelists, such as Eug√®ne Sue, Edouard Corbi√®re, Frederick Chamier and William Glasgock, innovated and explored the genre subsequently. The original cover of Cooper's The Pilot, printed in 1823.James Fenimore Cooper wrote, what is often described as the first sea novel,This is a debatable claim, dependent on the limitations placed on the genre, per the discussion in the definition section. Margaret Cohen, for example, states that \\"[a]fter a seventy-five year hiatus, the maritime novel was reinvented by James Fenimore Cooper, with the Pilot\\". The Novel and the Sea. Princeton: Prineton University Press, 2010, p. 133. The Pilot (1824), in response to Walter Scott's The Pirate (1821).Peck, \\"American Sea Fiction\\", in Maritime Fiction, 98-106. Cooper was frustrated with the inaccuracy of the nautical culture represented in that work. Though critical of The Pirate, Cooper borrowed many of the stylistic and thematic elements of the historical fiction genre developed by Walter Scott, such as a desire \\"to map the boundaries and identity of the nation.\\" In both The Pilot and the subsequent The Red Rover (1827) Cooper explores the development of an American national identity, and in his later Afloat and Ashore (1844) he again examines the subject of national identity. as well as offering a critique of American politics. Cooper's novels created an interest in sea novels in the United States, and led both Edgar Allan Poe in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838) as well as mass-market novelists like Lieutenant Murray Ballou to write novels in the genre. The prominence of the genre also influenced non-fiction. Critic John Peck describe's Richard Henry Dana's Two Years Before the Mast (1840) as utilizing a similar style and addressing the same thematic issues of national and masculine identity as nautical fiction developing after Cooper's pioneering works. Fenimore Cooper greatly influenced the French novelist Eug√®ne Sue (1804 ‚Äì1857), whose own his naval experiences supplied much of the materials for Sue's first novels, Kernock le pirate (1830), Atar-Gull (1831), the \\"widely admired\\" La Salamandre (1832), La Coucaratcha (1832‚Äì1834), and others, which were composed at the height of the Romantic movement.Margaret Cohen, The Novel and the Sea. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010), p. 170. The more famous French novelist Alexandre Dumas (1802‚Äì1870) \\"made no secret of his admiration for Cooper\\" and wrote Le Capitaine Paul (1838) as a sequel to Cooper's Pilot.Margaret Cohen, The Novel and the Sea, p. 177. Another French novelist who had a seafarer background was Edouard Corbi√®re (1793‚Äì1875), the author of numerous maritime novels, including Les Pilotes de l'Iroise (1832), and Le N√©grier, aventures de mer, (1834). In Britain, the genesis of a nautical fiction tradition is often attributed to Frederick Marryat. Frederick Marryat's career as a novelist stretched from 1829 until his death in 1848, with many set at sea, including Mr Midshipman Easy.Susan Bassnett \\"Cabin'd Yet Unconfined: Heroic Masculinity in English Seafaring Novels\\" in Klein 'Fictions of the Sea Adapting Cooper's approach to fiction, Marryat's sea novels also reflected his own experience in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars, in part under the command of Thomas Cochrane‚Äîwho would also later inspire Patrick O'Brian's character Jack Aubrey. Thematically Marryat focuses on ideas of heroism, proper action of officers, and reforms within the culture of the navy. Marryat's literary works participate in a larger British cultural examination of maritime service during the early part of the 19th century, where subjects such as naval discipline and naval funding were in widespread public debate. Peck describes Marryat's novels as consistent in their core thematic focuses on masculinity and the contemporary naval culture, and in doing so, he suggests, they provide a complex reflection on \\"a complex historical moment in which author, in his clumsy way, engages with rapid change in Britain.\\"John Peck \\"Captain Marryat's Navy\\" in Maritime Fiction, pp. 50-69. Marryat's novels encouraged the writing of other novels from veterans of the Napoleonic wars during the 1830s, like M.H. Baker, Captain Chamier, Captain Glascock, Edward Howard, and William J. Neale; these authors frequently both reflect on and defend the public image of the navy.Peck, pp. 50-69. Novels by these authors highlight a more conservative, and supportive view of the navy, unlike texts from those interested in reforming the navy, like Nautical Economy; or forecastle recollections of events during the last war, which were critical of naval disciplinary practices, during a period when public debates ensued around various social and political reform movements. Marryat's novels tend to be treated as unique in comparison to these other works however; Peck argues that Marryat's novels, though in part supportive of the navy, also highlight a \\"disturbing dimension\\" of the navy. =Late 19th century= The Polish cover to Joseph Conrad's 1904 novel Lord Jim As the model of the sea novel solidified into a distinct genre, writers in both Europe and the United States produced major works of literature in the genre, for example Melville's Moby- Dick, Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim. John Peck describes Herman Mellville and Joseph Conrad as the \\"two great English-language writers of sea stories\\": better novelists than predecessors Cooper and Marryat, both flourished writing in the \\"adventure novel\\" genre.Peck, pp. 107-126. Moreover, unlike the earlier novels, which were written during a thriving nautical economic boom, full of opportunities and affirmation of national identity, novels by these authors were written \\"at a point where a maritime based economic order [was] disintegrating.\\" The genre also inspired a number of popular mass-market authors, like American Ned Buntline, Britain Charles Kingsley and Frenchman Jules Verne. Mellville's fiction frequently involves the sea, with his first five novels following the naval adventures of seamen, often a pair of male friends (Typee (1846), Omoo (1847), Mardi (1849), Redburn (1849) and White-Jacket (1850) ).Peck, \\"Herman Mellville\\" in Maritime Fiction, 107-126. However, Moby-Dick is his most important work, sometimes called the Great American Novel, it was also named \\"the greatest book of the sea ever written\\" by D.H. Lawrence. In this work, the hunting of a whale by Captain Ahab, immerses the narrator Ishmael in a spiritual journey, a theme which is developed again in Conrad's much later Heart of Darkness. The importance of naval power in maintaining Britains' vast worldwide empire led to numerous novels with nautical themes.Peck, \\"Mid- Victorian Maritime Fiction\\", pp. 127‚Äì148. Some of these just touch on the sea, as with Sylvia's Lovers (1863) by Elizabeth Gaskell, where the nautical world is a foil to the social life ashore. However, British novelists increasingly focused on the sea in the 19th century, particular when they focus on the upper classes. In such works sea voyages became a place for strong social commentary, as, for example Trollope's John Caldigate (1877), in which Trollope depicts a character travelling to Australia to make his fortune, and Wilkie Collins's Armadale (1866), which follows gentlemen yachting. Likewise William Clark Russell's novels, especially the first two, John Holdsworth, Chief Mate (1875) and The Wreck of the Grosvenor (1877), both of which highlight the social anxieties of Victorian Britain. At the same time that literary works embraced the sea narrative in Britain, so did the most popular novels of adventure fiction, of which Marryat is a major example.Peck, \\"Adventures at Sea\\", pp. 149‚Äì164. Critic John Peck emphasises this subgenre's impact on boys' books. In these novels young male characters go through‚Äîoften morally whitewashed‚Äîexperiences of adventure, romantic entanglement, and \\"domestic commitment\\".Peck, pp.149-164. Charles Kingsley is the most definitive writers of this genre, writing over one hundred boys' books, \\"many with a maritime theme\\", including Westward Ho!.Peck, pp. 149-164. Other authors include R. M. Ballantyne, The Coral Island (1858), G.A. Henty, Under Drake's Flag (1882), Robert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island (1883), and Rudyard Kipling, Captains Courageous (1897), all of which were also read by adults, and helped expand the potential of naval adventure fiction. Other novels by Stevenson, including Kidnapped, Catriona, The Master of Ballantrae, and The Ebb-Tide (co-authored with Lloyd Osbourne) have significant scenes aboard ships, =The 20th and 21st centuries= The first edition cover of Jack London's The Sea Wolf (1904) Twentieth century novelists expand on the earlier traditions. The modernist Joseph Conrad drew inspiration from a range of earlier nautical works like Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea (1866), and Leopold McClintock's book about his 1857‚Äì59 expeditions in search of Sir John Franklin's lost ships, as well as works by James Fenimore Cooper and Frederick Marryat.Najder, Z. (2007) Joseph Conrad: A Life. Camden House, pp. 41‚Äì42 Most of Conrad's works draw directly from this seafaring career: Conrad had a career in both the French and British merchant marine, climbing to the rank of captain. His most famous novel, Heart of Darkness (1899), is based on a three- year employment with a Belgian trading company. His other nautical fiction includes An Outcast of the Islands (1896) The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' (1897), Lord Jim (1900), Typhoon (1902), Chance (1913), The Rescue (1920), The Rover (1923).Peck, \\"Joseph Conrad\\", pp. 165-185. A number of other novelists started writing nautical fiction early in the century. Jack London's The Sea Wolf (1904), was influenced by Kipling's recently published Captains Courageous (1897). Welsh novelist Richard Hughes (1900‚Äì1976) wrote only four novels, the most famous of which is the pirate adventure, A High Wind in Jamaica. He also wrote In Hazard (1938) about a merchant ship caught in a hurricane.New York Review of Books English poet and novelist John Masefield (1878‚Äì1967), who had himself served at sea,\\"John Masefield a Biographical Sketch. The Masefield Society wrote The Bird of Dawning (1933), relating the adventures of the crew of a China tea clipper, who are forced to abandon ship and take to the boats.Good Reads The novels of two other prominent British sea novelists, C.S. Forester (1899‚Äì1966) and Patrick O'Brian (1914‚Äì2000), define the conventional boundaries of contemporary naval fiction. A number of later authors draw on Forester's and O'Brian's models of representing individual officers or sailors as they progress through their careers in the British navy, including Alexander Kent and Dudley Pope. Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey- Maturin series straddles the divide between popular and literary fiction, distinguishing itself from Hornblower, one reviewer even commented the books have \\"escaped the usual confines of naval adventure [. . .] attract[ing] new readers who wouldn‚Äôt touch Horatio Hornblower with a bargepole.\\" There are also reviews that compare these works to Jane Austen and similar authors. though this is not a universally held opinion. Several other notable authors, wrote contemporary to O'Brian and Forester, but expanded the boundaries of the genre. Nicholas Monsarrat's novel The Cruel Sea (1951) follows a young naval officer Keith Lockhart during World War II service abourd \\"small ships\\". Monsarrat's short-story collections H.M.S. Marlborough Will Enter Harbour (1949), and The Ship That Died of Shame (1959) previously made into a film of the same name, mined the same literary vein, and gained popularity by association with The Cruel Sea.Christine L. Krueger Encyclopedia of British Writers, 19th and 20th Centuries. Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 257. Another important British novelist who wrote about life at sea was William Golding (1911‚Äì1993). His novel Pincher Martin (1956) records the delusions experienced by a drowning sailor in his last moments. Golding's postmodernist trilogy To the Ends of the Earth is about sea voyages to Australia in the early nineteenth century, and draws extensively on the traditions of Jane Austen, Joseph Conrad and Herman Melville, and is Golding's most extensive piece of historiographic metafiction. Four of Arthur Ransome‚Äôs children's novels in the Swallows and Amazons series (published 1930‚Äì1947) involve sailing at sea (Peter Duck, We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea, Missee Lee and Great Northern?). The others are about sailing small boats in the Lake District or on the Norfolk Broads. Two short stories in Coots in the North are about sailing on a yacht in the Baltic: The Unofficial Side and Two Shorts and a Long. Swedish novelist Frans G. Bengtsson became widely known for his Viking saga novel R√∂de Orm (The Long Ships), published in two parts in 1941 and 1945. The hero Orm, later called R√∂de Orm (Red Snake) because of his red beard, is kidnapped as a boy onto a raiding ship and leads an exciting life in the Mediterranean area around the year 1000 AD. Later, he makes an expedition eastward into what is now Russia. The Long Ships was later adapted into a film. Authors continue writing nautical fiction in the twenty-first century, including, for example, another Scandinavian, Danish novelist Carsten Jensen's (1952‚Äì) epic novel We, the drowned (2006) describes life on both sea and land from the beginning of Danish-Prussian War in 1848 to the end of World War II. The novel focuses on the Danish seaport of Marstal, on the island of √Ür√∏,< https://newrepublic.com/article/85793/we-drowned-carsten-jensen>Hillary Kelly New Republic and voyages by the town's seamen all over the globe.Book review: Carsten Jensen's 'We, the Drowned' by Peter Behrens, February 22, 2011 Common themes =Masculinity and heroism= Lord Cochrane in 1807 by Peter Edward Stroehling. Cochrane is frequently a historical model for the kinds of heroism depicted in fiction set during the Napoleonic wars and Age of Sail. Those nautical novels dealing with life on naval and merchant ships set in the past are often written by men and deal with a purely male world with the rare exception, and a core themes found in these novels is male heroism. orig. presented at the 2000 Central New York Conference on Language and Literature, Cortland, N.Y This creates a generic expectation among readers and publishers. Critic Jerome de Groot identifies naval historical fiction, like Forester's and O'Brian's, as epitomizing the kinds of fiction marketed to men, and nautical fiction being one of the subgenre's most frequently marketed towards men. As John Peck notes, the genre of nautical fiction frequently relies on a more \\"traditional models of masculinity\\", where masculinity is a part of a more conservative social order. The painting The Action and Capture of the Spanish Xebeque Frigate El Gamo by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield illustrates one of the most famous battles by Lord Cochrane,The British brig-sloop Speedy's defeat of the Spanish xebec-frigate El Gamo on 6 May 1801, generally regarded as one of the most remarkable single-ship actions in naval history, founded the legendary reputation of the Speedy's commander, Lord Cochrane (later Admiral Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, GCB). which has been fictionalized by several nautical fiction authors; most famously Patrick O'Brian's first Aubrey-Maturin novel Master and Commander is based largely on Cochranes exploits in the action, and the character Jack Aubrey's heroic character is established through his similarities to Cochrane. However, as the genre has developed, models of masculinity and the nature of male heroism in sea novels vary greatly, despite being based on similar historical precedents like Thomas Cochrane (nicknamed the \\"Sea Wolf\\"), whose heroic exploits have been adapted by Marryat, Forestor, and O'Brian, among others. Susan Bassnet maps a change in the major popular nautical works. On the one hand Marryat's heroes focus on gentlemanly characteristics modeled on idealized ideas of actual captains such as Thomas Cochrane and Horatio Nelson. On the other hand, Forester's Hornblower is a model hero, presenting bravery, but inadequate at life ashore and beyond the navy and with limited emotional complexity. More recently O'Brian has explored complex ideas about masculinities through his characters Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin's friendship, along with the tension between naval life and shore life, and these men's complex passions and character flaws. Bassnett argues, these models of manliness frequently reflect the historical contexts in which authors write. Marryat's model is a direct political response to the reforms of the Navy and the Napoleonic Wars, while Forrestor is writing about post-World War II Britain, and O'Brian is exploring the social and scholarly complexities of the later part of the 20th century. Like O'Brian's novels, other 20th century authors treat masculinity as a complex plurality, full of questions about the idea of maleness. For example, William Golding's To the Ends of the Earth trilogy, explores the complexities of what constitutes a stable and acceptable male role as the civilian main character is thrust into the militaristic world of the navy, and is forced to work out afresh his own ideas of manhood. Though much of the tradition focuses on a militaristic storytelling, some of the prototypes of the genre focus on a commercial naval heritage but continue to highlight the role of masculinity and heroism with that tradition. For example, Iglesias describes Coopers novels and the subsequent novels in the American tradition growing out of \\"a distinctive attitude borne of commercial enterprise, confronting and ultimately superseding its Atlantic rival.\\" Only one of his novels, The Two Admirals, describes order of battle. Yet, the investigation of masculinity is central to the novels; Critic Steven Hathorn describes \\"Cooper deliberately invests his nautical world with a masculine character, to such a degree that the appearance of women aboard ships presents an array of problems [‚Ä¶] the novels explore how some of the biggest challenges to manhood come from within‚Äîfrom the very nature of masculinity itself.\\" James Fenimore Cooper's The Pilot questions the role of nautical symbols of heroes of the revolutionary period, such as John Paul Jones, and their unsavory naval practices while privateering. =Women at sea= An illustration from Dick Sand, A Captain at Fifteen by Jules Verne, drawn by Henri Meyer. Mrs Weldon (pictured here) is the only woman aboard the main ship during the novel. Although contemporary sea culture includes women working as fishers and even commanding naval ships, maritime fiction on the whole has not followed this cultural change.\\"Women in the Royal Navy serve in many roles; as pilots, observers and air-crew personnel; as divers, and Commanding Officers of HM Ships and shore establishments, notably Cdr Sarah West, who took up her appointment as CO of HMS PORTLAND in 2012, taking her ship from a refit in Rosyth to her current deployment as an Atlantic Patrol vessel. In another milestone for the Royal Navy, Commander Sue Moore was the first woman to command a squadron of minor war vessels; the First Patrol Boat Squadron (1PBS) ... Women can serve in the Royal Marines but not as RM Commandos.\\" ; for women as crew in the fishing industry, see \\"Women in Fish harvesting\\" Generally, in maritime fiction, women only have a role on passenger ships, as wives of warrant officers, and where the plot is on land. An example of a woman aboard a ship is Joseph Conrad's Chance (1913), where in the final section Captain Anthony takes his younger bride to sea with him and the captain's \\"obsessive passion\\" disturbs \\"the normal working relations of the ship\\".James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2002), p. 47. James Hanley's Captain Bottell closely parallels Conrad's work, though here Captain Bottell's obsession is with a government official's wife. This causes him to descend into madness, leaving the crew struggling \\"heroically to keep the ship afloat\\" during a storm. Critic John Fordham sees Hanley's novel as \\"a conscious anti-romantic attack\\" on Chance.John Fordham, James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class, pp. 47-8. There are, however, stories of women dressed as men serving at sea. In 1815, American Louisa Baker supposedly wrote The Female Marine; or the Adventures of Louisa Baker a narrative about her life aboard the USS Constitution as a warning to other young women. The book was widely read and accepted as fact, but historians now believe that Louisa Baker never existed, and that her story was created by publisher Nathaniel Coverly, Jr., and written by Nathan Hill Wright. The story was so popular that a sequel, The Adventures of Lucy Brown, was published. The success of this further inspired Nathaniel Coverly, Jr., to publish another tale of a female sailor, The Surprising Adventures of Almira Paul, in 1816. Again historians doubt that the book, which is full of fantastic adventure, danger, and romance, is really an autobiography of Almira Paul of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and what it is more likely is that the story was based on the lives of real women such as Hannah Snell and Mary Anne Talbot‚Äîwomen who defied convention to live life on their own terms. Star-Crossed (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006) by Linda Collison, and the subsequent Barbados Bound, Book 1 of the Patricia MacPherson Nautical Adventure Series is historical fiction, which were inspired by the documented occurrences of actual women who served aboard ship as men. Early in the nineteenth century Captain Marryat's Frank Mildhay (1829) explores an important part of sailor's life ashore, their sexual encounters. John Peck, in Maritime Fiction comments that Frank's \\"encounters with prostitutes and a relationship with an actress resulting in a child are not what might be expected\\", that is he is not \\"the kind of honest lad', the kind of midshipmen portrayed by Jane Austen or \\"who well be at the centre of Marryat's Mr Midshipman Easy \\".John Peck, pp. 53-59. Peck further suggests that in \\"Marryat's navy there is\\" both \\"contempt for\\" and \\"fear of women\\".John Peck, p. 57. The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1920s ran a series of short stories about \\"Tugboat Annie\\" Brennan, a widow who ran a tugboat and successfully competed for a share of the towboat business in Puget Sound. Annie and her crew also did some crime fighting and helped people caught in storms and floods. The series was extremely popular and there were two films and a television show that were based on it. Harcourt published L.A. Meyer's Bloody Jack (2002), the first novel in the young adult fiction series set in the early 19th century centering around the titular character Mary (Jacky) Faber. The first adventure featured Jacky disguised as a cabin boy aboard a British naval ship. The eleven subsequent titles feature other maritime or river adventures, with reference to and direct inspiration from nautical culture, historical events and people, tall tales and classic nautical fiction. =The working class at sea= Until the 20th century nautical fiction focused on officer protagonists and John Peck suggests, that \\"the idea of the gentleman is absolutely central in maritime fiction\\".Maritime Fiction, p. 172. However, historically, the bulk of people aboard nautical voyages are common sailors, drawn from the working classes. An early, somewhat disapproving, portrait of ordinary seamen is found in Herman Melville's fourth novel Redburn: His First Voyage: Being the Sailor-boy Confessions and Reminiscences of the Son-of-a-Gentleman, in the Merchant Service, published in 1849,See the Library of America edition edited by George Thomas Tanselle. Melville's semi-autobiographical account of the adventures of a refined youth among coarse and brutal sailors and the seedier areas of Liverpool. In June 1839 Melville had signed aboard the merchant ship St. Lawrence as a \\"boy\\"See Redburn, p. 82: \\"For sailors are of three classes able-seamen, ordinary- seamen, and boys [‚Ä¶] In merchant-ships, a boy means a green-hand, a landsman on his first voyage.\\" (a green hand) for a cruise from New York to Liverpool. He returned on the same ship on the first of October, after five weeks in England. Joseph Conrad's novella The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' (1897) about a black sailor from the West Indies was first published in America as The Children of the Sea: A Tale of the Forecastle. However, it was not until the twentieth century that sea stories \\"of men for'ard of the bridge\\" really developed,James Hanley, \\"Sugi‚ÄìMugi\\" review of B. Traven's Death Ship, Spectator 26 January 1934, p. 131. starting with American playwright Eugene O'Neill's SS Glencairn one act plays written 1913‚Äì17, and his full-length play The Hairy Ape (1922). The latter is an expressionist play about a brutish, unthinking laborer known as Yank as he searches for a sense of belonging in a world controlled by the rich. At first Yank feels secure as he stokes the engines of an ocean liner, and is highly confident in his physical power over the ship's engines, but later he undergoes a crisis of identity. O'Neill spent several years at sea, and he joined the Marine Transport Workers Union of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which was fighting for improved living conditions for the working class utilizing quick \\"on the job\\" direct action. O'Neill was a major influence on a number of subsequent writers of nautical fiction, like James Hanley and George Garrett.Ken Worpole, Dockers and Detectives. London: Verso editions, 1983, p. 80. The 1930s saw the publication of a number of short stories and novels about life of seamen below deck, some written by adventure seekers from wealthy families, like Melville and O'Neill, and others from the working class, who had gone to sea out of necessity. Moneyed Malcolm Lowry was \\"driven to the docks in the family limousine\\", when he was eighteen to begin a voyage \\"as deck hand, cabin boy and ultimately a fireman's helper on a tramp steamer\\".Margerie Lowry, \\"Introductory Note\\" to Malcolm Lowry, Ultramarine. London: Jonathan Cape, 1963, p. 7. From this experience as a common seaman came Lowry's novel Ultramarine (1933), a work influenced by Nordahl Grieg's The Ship Sails On and Conrad Aiken's Blue Voyage.Margerie Lowry, \\"Introductory Note\\" to Malcolm Lowry, Ultramarine, pp. 7-8. Working class writers who describe experiences in the merchant navy include, James Hanley, Jim Phelan, George Garrett, John Sommerfield (They Die Young (1930),London Books), Liam O'Flaherty and B. Traven. Writing about the men below decks required a different approach. For example, James Hanley describes Traven's Death Ship (1934), as \\"the first real book about the lives for'ard of the bridge\\".James Hanley, \\"Sugi‚ÄìMugi\\" review of B. Traven's Death Ship. The novel portrays what Hanley calls the \\"real, horrible, fantastic, but disgustingly true\\".Hanley>James Hanley, \\"Sugi‚ÄìMugi\\" review of B. Traven's Death Ship\\". Spectator, 26 January 1934, p. 131 Hanley's own early novel Boy has been described as \\"truly disturbing novel\\", and explores sexual abuse of a teenage youth aboard a cargo ship.Ken Worpole, Dockers and Detectives, p. 82.Ken Worpole, Dockers and Detectives, p. 83. According to Paul Lester the \\"opening pages of Jim Phelan's Ten-A-Pennry People, resembles Boy\\", and this novel continues with details of how life as a stoker \\"will destroy a man physically\\".Paul Lester, \\"Life: The Writings of Jim Phelan, London Magazine, vol. 36, nos. 7 & 8, p. 45. George Garrett in his short stories also wrote \\"about life among harsh realities\\" on both land and at sea.\\"Introduction\\" to The Collected George Garrett, ed. Michael Murphy. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press, 1999, pxxi. The works of these writer diverges greatly from earlier writers who use more romantic depictions of upper class men at sea, like Fenimore Cooper, Melville (even Redburn) and Joseph Conrad, depicting what critic Alan Ross called men generally \\"found covered in grease below decks\\".Alan Ross, ed., James Hanley 'The Last Voyage and Other Stories' . London: Harvill Press, 1997, p. xv Garrett wrote, that \\"[Conrad] could write romantically and vividly of a ship in heavy sea, but when it came to men aboard he wrote as a conservatively-minded officer\\", and criticizes Conrad's depiction of the sailor Donkin as a villain in his novella Nigger of the Narcissus.George Garrett, \\"Conrad's The Nigger of the 'Narcissus, The Collected George Garrett, ed. Michael Murphy, p. 240. Japanese authors have also explored working-men's life at sea. Takiji Kobayashi's K'sanik≈çsen (1929) (The Crab Cannery Ship, 2013)) describes the exploitation of Japanese crab fishermen by ship owners from a left-wing point-of-view. The book has been made into a film and manga. While Right-wing novelist Yukio Mishima, in his novel Gogo no Eik≈ç (1963) (The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea,1965), chronicles the story of Ryuji, a sailor with vague notions that a special honor awaiting him at sea. Life ashore Another aspect of sailors' lives is their experiences of sailortown, that area of public houses, brothels, lodgings, etc., close to the docks which caters to their needs away from home.See, Valerie Burton, \\" 'As I wuz a-rolling down the Highway one morn': Fictions of the 19th-century English Sailortown\\" in Fictions of the Sea: Critical Perspectives on the Ocean in British Literature and Culture. London: Routledge, 2002. Herman Melville describes in Redburn Liverpool's sailortown.Andrew Lees, Liverpool: The Hurricane Port. New York: Random House, 2013 There are also works that deal with their experiences in their home port and those of their families ashore. Carsten Jensen's Vi, de druknede (We, the drowned, 2006) not only deals with men at sea but also encompasses the lives of boys growing up with dreams of becoming sailors and the experiences of the wives ‚Äì and widows ‚Äì of the seamen. James Hanley is another author who explores not only life afloat but the experiences of them and their families on land, especially in his series of five novels The Furys Chronicle.Edward Stokes, The Novels of James Hanley, Melbourne, Australia, F. W. Cheshire, 1964. =Slave ships= While many maritime novels focus on adventure and heroic deeds, the prime function of ships, other than warfare, is the making of money. The darkest aspect of this, involving both greed and cruelty is seen in the slave trade: \\"The story of Britain's involvement in the slave trade echoes the profit versus morality debate that is present in so many maritime novels\\".John Peck,Maritime Fiction, pp. 6-7. Sacred Hunger (1992) is a historical novel by Barry Unsworth (1930‚Äì2012), which is set in the mid 18th century in the English sea port of Liverpool and aboard the Liverpool Merchant a slave ship. The novel's central theme is greed, with the subject of slavery being a primary medium for exploring the issue. The story line has a very extensive cast of characters, and the narrative interweaves elements of appalling cruelty and horror with extended comic interludes.Books of The Times; Trading in Misery On a Doomed Slave Ship Review by The New York Times Booker Club: Sacred Hunger from The Guardian It shared, in 1992, the Booker Prize that year with Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient. A sequel, The Quality of Mercy, Unsworth's last book, was published in 2011. Greed and man's inhumanity to his fellows is also the subject of Fred D'Aguiar's third novel, Feeding the Ghosts (1997), which was inspired by the true story of the Zong massacre in which 132 slaves were thrown from a slave ship into the Atlantic for insurance purposes. According to historical accounts, one slave survived and climbed back onto the ship; and in D'Aguiar's narrative this slave ‚Äì about whom there is next to no historical information ‚Äì is developed as the fictional character Mintah. =Passenger ships= The importance of \\"the idea of the gentleman\\" can also be a theme of novels set on passenger ships, as for example with Anthony Trollope's novel John Caldigate. Several chapters of this novel deal with the eponymous hero's voyage to Australia. While Trollope claims \\"that life at sea is unlike life in general\\" the novel, in fact, presents \\"an intensified version of ordinary life, with social divisions rigorously enforced\\" which is underlined by \\"the physical separation of first- and second-class passengers\\".John Peck, Maritime Fiction, p. 140. While William Golding's novel Rites of Passage (1980) is set on board a warship the ship is also carrying a number of passengers on their way to Australia, who encompass a motley yet representative collection of early 19th century English society. Class division, or the assumption of a higher status than is warranted, is a running theme of the book.Indu Kulkarni, The Novels of William Golding. Atlantic Publishers, 2003. p. 100. This theme focuses upon that major theme of maritime fiction, the proper conduct of a gentleman; however, it also deals with his often-stormy friendship between the protagonist Talbot and one of the officers, Lieutenant Summers, who sometimes feels slighted by Talbot's ill-thought-out comments and advice. Like many of Golding's books, it also looks at man's reversion to savagery in the wake of isolation.Crawford, Paul, Politics and History in William Golding: The World Turned Upside Down. University of Missouri Press, 2002, p. 194. This novel forms the trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, with Close Quarters (1987) and Fire Down Below (1989). Beryl Bainbridge deals with the sinking of the RMS Titanic in Every Man for Himself, which won the 1996 Whitbread Prize, and was a nominee of the Booker Prize.\\"Every Man for Himself\\" page, Fantastic Fiction. It also won the 1997 Commonwealth Writers' Prize (Europe and South Asia). Sometimes, as with Katherine Anne Porter's Ship of Fools (1962), a ship can be a symbol: \\"if thought of as isolated in the midst of the ocean, a ship can stand for mankind and human society moving through time and struggling with its destiny.\\"W. H. Auden, The Enchafed Flood or The Romantic Iconography of the Sea. London: Faber, 1951, p. 61. Set in 1931 Ship of Fools is an allegory that traces the rise of Nazism and looks metaphorically at the progress of the world on its \\"voyage to eternity\\" in the years leading to World War II. The novel tells the tale of a group of disparate characters sailing from Mexico to Europe aboard a German passenger ship. The large cast of characters includes Germans, a Swiss family, Mexicans, Americans, Spaniards, a group of Cuban medical students, and a Swede. In steerage there are 876 Spanish workers being returned from Cuba. Porter's title alludes to Ship of Fools (1494) by Sebastian Brant, which is an allegory, originating from Plato,See Philosophy Now for a one-page summary of Plato's original 'Ship of Fools' argument against democracy (link to article), accessed March 2014. The allegory depicts a vessel without a pilot, populated by human inhabitants who are deranged, frivolous, or oblivious, and seemingly ignorant of their course. The concept makes up the framework of the 15th century book which served as the inspiration for Hieronymous Bosch's famous painting, Ship of Fools: a ship‚Äîan entire fleet at first‚Äîsets off from Basel, bound for the Paradise of Fools. Nautical detail and language A distinction between nautical fiction and other fiction merely using the sea as a setting or backdrop is an investment in nautical detail. Luis Iglesias describes James Fenimore Cooper's use in The Pilot of nautical language and \\"faithful [...] descriptions of nautical maneuvers and the vernacular expression of seafaring men\\" as reinforcing his work's authority for the reader, and as giving more credence to characters, which distinguishes it from earlier fiction set on or around the sea.

Today part of the National Park Service, Fort Cronkhite is a former US Army post that served as part of the coastal artillery defenses of the San Francisco Bay Area during World War II. The soldiers at Cronkhite manned gun batteries, radar sites, and other fortifications on the high ridges overlooking the fort. History Named for former army major general Adelbert Cronkhite, Fort Cronkhite was established in the late 1930s. With the rapid military buildup of the United States in the early 1940s, tens of thousands of temporary wooden structures had to be built by the army to house its growing ranks. The army's Quartermaster Corps and the Corps of Engineers were put in charge of the building projects around the country. Using standard plans, all types of buildings could be built in short time including barracks, mess halls, supply depots, chapels, and recreation buildings. Many of these types of \\"temporary\\" wooden building can still be found at Fort Cronkhite today over 70 years later.http://www.nps.gov/goga/historyculture/world-war-ii-temporary- construction.htm National Park Service.

Townsley, who had commanded the 30th Infantry Division in France in World War I, construction of Battery Townsley began in 1938 with the excavation for the large magazine and gun emplacement on the ridge overlooking what would become Fort Cronkhite. When it was completed in 1940 and transferred to the Coast Artillery Corps it was the second 16-inch battery on the West Coast, after Battery Davis at Fort Funston. The battery was manned at all times with the men on each shift living in the concrete walls of the battery high on the ridge. Battery Townsley is open to the public every first Sunday of the month, from 12 noon to 4 PM.http://www.nps.gov/goga/historyculture/battery-townsley.htm National Park Service.

SF-88 operated throughout the 1960s and early 1970s until it was permanently closed in 1974. Many of the older wooden buildings of the fort had already started to be torn down by the army in the previous years and with the closure of SF-88 Fort Cronkhite was closed altogether soon after.http://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&PageID;=122446 National Park Service.

The festival made its debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in 2005, and has since expanded to other parts of the world. Originally co-founded by James Spooner and Matthew Morgan, the festival was inspired by Spooner's 2003 documentary film Afro-Punk, which spotlighted black punks across America and later culminated in a series of live shows entitled \\"The Liberation Sessions\\" co-curated by Spooner and Morgan.AfroPunk Started With a Documentary, Village Voice The festival originally sought to provide black people an opportunity to build community within the predominantly white punk subculture and to provide a stage for black alternative performers that were not acknowledged in the mainstream and stood outside hip hop, R&B;, soul, etc. To attract a wider audience, the festival shifted to include soul music and hip hop, which expanded its target demographic, attracting headliners including Ice Cube, Lauryn Hill, Lenny Kravitz, and Gary Clark, Jr.. Musical performers now represent a variety of genres, primarily known to reflect African-American culture. Afropunk's changes to its diverse cultural showcase has allowed for the festival to build its masses to 60,000 attendees. Due to festival alterations that deviated from the original Afropunk culture, former co-founder, James Spooner made the decision to end his involvement in 2008. Soon after, Jocelyn Cooper was introduced to the festival as co-organizer, broadening Afropunk Fest to Atlanta, Paris, London, and Johannesburg, South Africa.  History  = 2003-2005 = James Spooner debuted his 66-minute documentary film Afro-Punk in 2003. It explores the lives of black youth within a white punk subculture with the aim of expanding notions of blackness and reclaiming rock's roots by providing a platform for black artists that were not given the opportunity elsewhere. Growing up bi-racial, on the streets of New York City, Spooner discovered and connected with the punk music scene and its culture but also felt alienated from both his white peers in the scene and the black community outside the scene. After examining the world of hardcore punk in America at the time, and noticing the lack of people of color, along with the absence of dialogue around race despite its activist leanings, he began to question what it means to be black within alternative scenes. Digging deeper into the subject of race became the inspiration for his documentary. Traveling throughout the United States and abroad, Spooner followed the lives of four African Americans who submerged and dedicated their lives to the punk rock scene and its values. Through exclusive interviews with punks and various punk rock bands including, Fishbone, 24-7 Spyz, and Dead Kennedys, Spooner's documentary covered issues of loneliness, exile, inter- racial dating, and the double lives people of color lead within a predominately white sub-cultured community. Spooner toured the film throughout the United States and the world, screening it over 300 times and garnering followers and building community. He then created a message board to connect alternative black people from around the world. Soon after he held shows to foster that community. Shows included Bad Brains Tributes, The Double Consciousness Rock series at CBGBs, a west coast tour and screening with Ricky Fitts, and others.Looking for The Punk That's Gone Missing, Nylon Magazine Spooner was later interested in having the black fronted rock band Stiffed perform after one of his screenings. He contacted Santi White's manager, Matthew Morgan, who thought that the opportunity would be a vehicle to get Santi signed. After success with Spooner's film and the live events, the two began to collaborate on a party called the Liberation Sessions, which promoted black artistry via music and film. Two years later, they would go on to create the Afropunk Music and Film Festival from 2005 to 2008 in conjunction with the Brooklyn Academy of Music.How Brooklyn's AfroFest Became A Global Brand, The Bridge Magazine = AFROPUNK.com = After being featured at the Toronto International Film Festival, American Black Film Festival, and the Pan African Film & Arts Festival, AfroPunk began receiving multiple awards and forms of recognition from all over the world. With Afro-Punk's rising notability, Spooner mobilized the black punk rock community he had created on Afropunk.com's message board. The message board gained thousands of members with common interests: black punk rock music and values.The True Story of How AfroPunk Turned a Message Board Into a Movement, Fader Magazine = 2005-2008 = Afropunk, the festival, was created as a safe space for black alternative- minded punks to freely express themselves and build a community with one another. The festival was free and was supported by The Brooklyn Academy of Music. As the festival grew larger, reaching larger demographics, the presence of punk culture began to shift toward a larger audience, focusing more on neo- soul, pop, or hip hop performances. Along with the notable change in the festival's focused genre, the festival also began charging admission prices. As Afropunk became scantily punk, moving away from its origins and original demographic, James Spooner also departed. During Afropunk's fourth festival, a rap-reggea-punk band performed a cover of Buju Banton's, \\"Boom Bye Bye,\\" which caused controversy with the black queer community, one of Afropunk's core target demographic groups. Spooner jumped on stage and denounced the song and its presence at the festival. Disheartened with how Morgan was deviating from Afropunk's original values, and transitioning the festival more towards a mainstream audience, James Spooner departed in 2008.How AfroPunk Became a Full Blown Movement, Racked Magazine = 2009 - Present = After James Spooner's departure in 2008, music industry veteran, Jocelyn Cooper joined Matthew Morgan in 2009. As the former head of A&R; at Universal, Cooper transitioned into Afropunk's music festival by aiding in the development of their sponsorships and directing Multiply, Afropunk's marketing, content, and advertising agency. With Cooper's involvement, she's was able to secure brand partnership deals with MillerCoors, Toyota, Nike, and Pantene. As Jocelyn developed relationships with major companies, giving her the opportunity to broaden Afropunk across seas, she was able to expand the Brooklyn-based summer festival from 2,500 attendees to 90,000 among multiple cities, including Atlanta in 2015 and Paris and London in 2016. New to the roster for its 2017 festival tour will include Johannesburg, South Africa. = Criticisms = Having emerged from political punk roots, Afropunk Fest has faced criticism throughout its history,AfroPunk's Growing Pains, Mail & Guardian including backlash over booking choices such as MIA (a non black performer who critiqued the Black Lives Matter Movement),M.I.A.'s Provocative Pop, The New Yorker Ice Cube (a rapper with past accusations of misogyny),Ice Cube Justifies Lyrics..., Huffington Post Tyler the Creator (a performer with a history of homophobia and lyrics normalizing rape),Rappers and Rape, The Guardian along with others. Attendees have also critiqued the values of Afropunk's organizers surrounding LGBQT concerns, treatment of employees, and its corporate leanings. Some attendees critique the festival for appealing to white audiences,How to be a Good Ally at AfroPunk including an instance of attendees being removed from an area of the festival for wearing a homemade t-shirt critical of the event.Couple Thrown Out Of AfroPunk VIP, The Root In August 2018, Afropunk's Editor-In-Chief resigned after over a decade of work for Afropunk citing mistreatment and a corporate agenda he labeled \\"performative activism\\".AFROPUNK Editor Resigns There are also lawsuits and other reports of abuse that have been circulating the festival.Festival Staff Abuse, Vibe Magazine Notable performers See also * Afro-punk * James Spooner * Afro-Punk (film) External links *Afro-Punk Film Official Site *AfroPunk Festival Official Site References Category:Music festivals in New York City Category:2005 establishments in New York City Category:African-American culture Category:Punk rock festivals Category:African Americans in New York City ","title":"Afropunk Festival"},{"id":"45225364","text":"A Million to One is a 1937 American drama film directed by Lynn Shores and written by John T.

Retrieved 29 January 2015. was a politician in Queensland, Australia. He was briefly a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life Rev Nelson was of Scottish origin and arrived in Australia in 1853 after being invited by the Sydney Presbytery to take spiritual charge of the Presbyterians in the district of Ipswich. He resigned from this position in 1860 to take up pastoral pursuits on the Moonie River. Prior to his resignation, he was encouraging subscriptions for a new Church of Scotland to be built in Toowoomba, and he was identified as a Presbyterian minister in Toowoomba in 1868. Politics William Nelson was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the three-member electorate of West Moreton on 3 May 1860 in the inaugural 1860 Queensland colonial election. However, Mr Chubb on behalf of one of the unsuccessful candidates, Pollett Cardew, protested against the election of the Reverend Nelson as he was a priest in holy orders and was therefore disqualified from being elected, but the Rev. Nelson claimed that he had resigned his religious role. On 22 June 1860, the Committee on Elections ruled that the Rev. Nelson was disqualified and a new election must be called to replace him. Joseph Fleming won the resulting by-election on 9 July 1860. Personal life Although his own political career was very brief, William Lambie Nelson's son Hugh Muir Nelson went on to be Premier of Queensland. His homestead Gabbinbar in Toowoomba was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Nelson died in 1887 and was buried in Southport General Cemetery.

History Pintlala, and nearby Pintlala Creek, are named for the Creek words, pithlo, meaning \\"canoe\\", and the verb form of halatas, meaning \\"to drag\\". Pintlala was founded as an Upper Creek town, situated around Sam Moniac's tavern on the Old Federal Road. 50 to 60 houses were burned here by American forces during the Creek War. Sam Moniac was the brother in law of William Weatherford and the father of David Moniac. General James Wilkinson and Benjamin Hawkins both stopped at Moniac's tavern while traveling on the Federal Road. Soon after Wilkinson stopped there, Moniac's tavern and home were burned down by members of the Red Sticks. Pintlala School was founded in 1923, due to the consolidation of schools located in smaller communities such as Hope Hull, Le Grand, and Snowdoun. The last meeting of the Alabama Chapter of The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry met at Grange Hall in Pintlala in July 1891. A post office operated under the name Pint Lala from 1827 to 1883, and under the name Colquitt from 1900 to 1904.

The cathedral church, noted for its English Baroque architecture inspired by the 17th century St Paul's Cathedral, is located at the west end of Mahatma Gandhi Road, MacIver Town, Bangalore. Founded in 1808, the cathedral celebrated its 200 years bicentenary in 2007-8. The cathedral is open for all people irrespective of religion or faith. History The foundation stone was laid in 1808, and construction was completed in 1812. The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Calcutta in 1816. The church was expanded in 1901, and went through reconstruction in 1927. The church had its beginnings as a garrison Anglican church. It became part of the Church of South India after Indian independence in 1947, going on to be the Cathedral of the Karnataka Central Diocese in 1961. When it began as a garrison church in 1808 of the Madras Army of the East India Company, it had a seating capacity of 400. As a result of the number of members growing to 2000, a new building was constructed in August 1902, with a seating capacity of 700. However, this new church building collapsed, and had to be rebuilt again in 1906. On 17 February 1923, the church building was ravaged by fire (caused by short circuit) and restoration had to take place. However, as the renovation works were about to be completed in February 1924, the church building again collapsed. Reconstruction of the church started in 1926 and was completed in 1927.

The first Indian Presbyter of the cathedral was Rev H F J Daniel, who was installed as the Presbyter-in-charge in 1961. Military Heritage The military colours of the 77th Moplah Rifles infantry Regiment, after disbandment (1907) are displayed on the west wall of St. Marks. There is also a memorial for the lives lost in the Moplah revolt. There are also memorial plaques for several British officers who lost their lives in the Bangalore Cantonment. There is also a memorial plaque for Lt.-Col Sir Walter Scott, 2nd Baronet, who died at sea in 1847, and was the nephew of Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott File:77th Moplah Rifles Colours 01.jpgThe Colours of the 77th Moplah Rifles with the Royal Mace File:77th Moplah Rifles Colours 02.jpgThe Colours of the 77th Moplah Rifles File:Moplah Revolt Memorial.jpgMemorial for the Officers and Men of the Dorset Regiment, who lost their lives in the Moplah Revolt Architecture The cathedral is a beautiful colonial style, modelled on the lines of the St Paul's Cathedral, London, with a dome, semi-circular chancel and roman arches. The entrance of the cathedral has elaborate wood work with ornate carvings. The ceilings and the domes are majestically done. The bell is the amongst the most well maintained church bells in India. The stained glasswork adds to the beauty of the cathedral. The church measures 100 * 53 * 20 ft3, and was the only government (Government of the British Madras Presidency) church in Bangalore. The extension in 1901, was also funded by the Government of British India. The renovated church was dedicated on 26 August 1902 by Bishop Whitehead of Madras. The stained glass was created by M/s Sreenivasulu Naidu & Sons, Madras. The stained glass on the west facing window was created by the architect of St. Dunstan's Society, England and cost INR 4500 The cathedral is an architectural marvel, but it is not something which happened overnight. Different architectural styles have been adopted during successive restoration and reconstruction work. As a result, the cathedral has a mixture of different architecture. Italian Marble from Genoa has been used in designing the pulpit and the font used for baby baptisms. The marble pulpit was created out by M/s Snaize & Co., and Bishop Tubbs of Palayamkottai was the first to preach on the marble pulpit on 1 July 1928, delivering the sermon 'The reunion of Christendom'. The Brass lectern (eagle with spread wings on the globe) was presented by some planters of Mysore in 1903, in memory of Harry Alexander Campbell and Montague Beaden Follett of Lumsden's Horse Regiment who died in the Boer Conflicts of South Africa. The bible on the lectern was presented by Mrs. Laura Amelia Amaller. However, in the late 1800s, an Indian ecclesiastical historian, described St. Marks church building as the ugliest ever constructed. It has seen grown into a beautiful church with some unique architectural features. Pipe Organ The pipe organ of the St. Mark's Cathedral was installed in 1929, as a gift by Avis F Cowdrey of the Cowdrey family (father of cricketer Michael Colin Cowdrey), in memory of his parents. The organ is designed by two British builders, with only the metal pipes being built in England. The other parts were made from teak, and built in Bangalore, supervised by Herbert Norman, agent of the British firm in India. It fell into disrepair, and was not used for many years, till it was repaired by Swiss experts at a cost of INR 5 million. The repaired pipe organ is a major draw for the musicians, and has also inspired repair works at the St. Andrew's Kirk and St. George's Cathedral in Chennai. In order to restore the organ, the then presbyter Vincent Rajkumar had coordinated a committee of experts. The organ was restored by the Orgelbau Felsberg Corporation, Switzerland, with organ builder Richard Freytah, and his colleagues Stefan Riniker and Hans Sievi. The restoration involved replacement of all the bellows, pipes, small trumpet and the blower, and converting keyboard to electric. The restoration took 4 months. School of Church Music The St Mark's Ecumenical Centre for church Music, located at the cathedral was established in 1990, with the intention of training musicians and music enthusiasts, on church music. It is open for all people, irrespective of affiliations of religion, denomination or church. The candidates prepare for the Trinity College of Music and Royal School of Music examinations in violin, piano, music theory and singing. Mission The cathedral has adopted several slums at Tilak Nagar, Ragigudda, Baglur Layout, Lazar layout and Lingarajpuram. The church also sends young people on study missions to Jaffna (Sri Lanka), Jharkhand and Hardwar. The church has also started a community college with a tailoring institute at the slums of Byappanahalli, a senior citizen home in the city and a resource mobilization centre also in the city. The church also runs a rural medical health centre at Hunsanahalli in the Kanakapura taluk. The church also invites leaders of other religious faiths to speak on the theme of peace, in its annual Festival of Peace music festival. Other Contributions Rev. R Posnett, the assistant chaplain of St. Mark's church, was instrumental in establishing the St. John's Church, Clevaland Town, Bangalore Cantonment in the early 1850s. The clergy (Rev. George Trevor) of St. Marks Cathedral also helped establish the St. Paul's Church, on Old Poor House Road, Bangalore Civil and Military Station, for the Tamil speaking believers. The church was built in the premises of the St. Paul's Tamil medium primary school (established in 1835, continued to function till 1900). Rev. WW Lutyens, established the Holy Trinity Church in 1850, at the other end of the South Parade. The house of Rev S.T. Pettigrew, chaplain of St. Marks was used to establish the Bishop Cottons's School.

One of her first stated goals as mayor was the establishment of a university in the city, a goal which was attained when the University of Ontario Institute of Technology was chartered in 2002. She spearheaded initiatives to improve the city's economy, including convening a panel of area mayors to come up with a plan to save the city's General Motors plant after staffing cutbacks at the company were announced.\\"Area mayors fight to save jobs at GM\\".

The case arose from a fatal accident that occurred in the chemistry laboratory of Patrick Harran at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Research assistant Sheharbano \\"Sheri\\" Sangji suffered severe burns from a fire that occurred on December 29, 2008 when a plastic syringe she was using to transfer the pyrophoric reagent tert-butyllithium from one sealed container to another came apart, spilling the chemical, and igniting a fire. Sangji was not wearing a protective lab coat and her clothing caught fire, resulting in severe burns that led to her death 18 days later. An investigation was conducted by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA), which protects the public and workers from safety hazards and enforces the U.S. State of California's occupational and public safety laws. In 2009, Cal/OSHA fined UCLA $31,875 for violations relating to the fire and in 2012, the Los Angeles District Attorney filed four felony charges against the Regents of the University of California and Patrick Harran for \\"willful violation of safety regulations\\".. However, prosecutors reached a deferred prosecution agreement after Harran agreed to pay a donation to a local burn center and do community service.. On September 6, 2018, the court announced that Harran had fulfilled the terms of the agreement, and dismissed the charges against him. Sangji's death and Harran's legal proceedings have led to a significant increase in the safety standards of research laboratories in academic settings. Sangji's family was unhappy with the terms of the settlement with Harran. Sangji's sister, Naveen, remarked \\"[t]his settlement, like the previous one with UCLA, is barely a slap on the wrist for the responsible individual.\\" She noted that previous safety violations in his lab were not corrected before her sister's death and that UCLA had ignored the \\"wake-up calls\\" of earlier accidents in other labs. She decried the nearly $4.5 million in legal fees the public university spent defending itself and Harran.

Early life Adele was born in St. Louis to Adolph Burgdorfer and Mary Elizabeth Frederick, both of whom were immigrants from Germany. Before moving to Los Angeles at the age of 16, she worked in a movie theater, where she got to watch countless films. Once she arrived in L.A., she got a job selling tickets at a theater in Hollywood; she worked as a treasurer for several theaters during this time period.Motion Picture Studio Directory and Trade Annual, 1921; Page: 284 Career Before she was out of her teens, she sold her first screenplay, 1919's L‚ÄôApache, which was produced by Thomas Ince for the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. After being added to the studio's scenario department, she continued to pen silent screenplays throughout the 1920s. She easily transitioned into sound films, and in 1933 would become one of the founding members of the Screen Writers Guild. Over her 40-year career, she accumulated over 100 writing credits. Buffington's specialty was the Western genre, with almost half of her films falling into that category. From the 1930s through the 1950s, she was one of the busiest writers in Hollywood. She wrote screenplays for most of the well-known Western actors of the period, including Tom Keene in Freighters of Destiny (1931), John Wayne in Haunted Gold (1932), Hoot Gibson in A Man's Land, Buck Jones in 1932's High Speed, Whip Wilson in Range Land (1949), and Tim Holt in Overland Telegraph (1951). She also occasionally wrote comedies for well-known actresses like Lucille Ball (Beauty for the Asking). In the early 1940s, under her pseudonym, Jess Bowers, she wrote two separate Western series. The first was for Buck Jones, who appeared as his character, Buck Roberts, in eight \\"Rough Riders\\" films, beginning with Arizona Bound, and finishing with Dawn on the Great Divide in 1942. The second series was with Johnny Mack Brown, for his character Nevada Mackenzie, for which she authored 10 scripts between 1943 and 1945.  Personal life  Buffington married Edward Vore in Los Angeles in 1926.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelters at Wickham Park as air raid shelters in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost ¬£56,596. Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non- reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that \\"if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war\\". Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built‚Äîreferred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\"‚Äîand only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelters in Wickham Park were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible.  Description  The Wickham Park air raid shelters are rectangular concrete structures comprising a heavy floor slab and a flat roof supported by four concrete piers. The shelters stand to the treed edge of Wickham Park, overlooking the Roma Street Railway Yards, and remain unaltered. They are overhung by mature fig trees. They are unpainted, and evidence of their entrances towards Wickham Terrace is visible on both floor slabs.  Heritage listing  Wickham Park Air Raid Shelters was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Wickham Park air raid shelters are important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelters located in Wickham Park are important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelters' solid construction, rectangular shape, and their siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelters. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Wickham Park air raid shelters, now used as shade structures, demonstrate the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelters are durable examples of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

History Former US border station at Porthill, IdahoThis crossing was first established in 1883, when Canada directed John Charles Rykert to establish Customs and Immigration inspection operations at the border, primarily to inspect vessels crossing the border on the Kootenai River. Mr. Rykert purchased most of the land east of the Kootenay River, and the current Canadian border station is named for him. A branch of the Great Northern Railway of Canada was constructed on the eastern shore of the river, but it stopped operating in 1913. The rail grade was later converted into a highway between Creston, BC and Bonners Ferry, ID. Canada first built a roadway border inspection station in 1948. which was replaced in 1973 with the present facility. In 1967, the US replaced its depression-era brick border station with the current wooden structure. A redesign of the road system approaching the border enabled the new facility to be built in a different location, so the old border station remains nearby. In 2014, the old border station was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The suburbs of New Farm, Teneriffe and Newstead lie to the west. Breakfast Creek joins the Brisbane River from the north-east at the northern end of Bulimba Reach. History International shipping in Bulimba Reach, circa 1932 The Bulimba Branch railway line was built in 1897 to support the wharves and industries located on the western bank of the Bulimba Reach in Newstead, Teneriffe and New Farm. Former wharves in the Bulimba Reach include: * Brisbane Stevedoring Company wharf (western bank) * Dalgety's Wharf (western bank) * Mercantile Wharf (western bank) Transport Bulimba ferry wharf, 2010 There are three ferry terminals on Bulimba Reach (from upstream to downstream): *Hawthorne ferry wharf (eastern bank) *Teneriffe ferry wharf (western bank) *Bulimba ferry wharf (eastern bank) The CityCat services all of these ferry terminals along the Brisbane River.

However, urban renewal projects have replaced the wharves with residential apartments and those warehouses are now separated from the river. Similarly on the western bank, the heritage-listed Bulimba House once occupied all the land down to the riverfront at the Bulimba Reach, but subdivision of the estate over the years has resulted in Bulimba House no longer being a riverbank property.

It features the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Nick Yacyshyn (Baptists), Brooklyn, NYC-based Brian Cook (Russian Circles, ex-These Arms Are Snakes, ex-Botch) and Vashon, Washington-based Aaron Turner (Mamiffer, Old Man Gloom, ex-Isis). Sumac released its debut album The Deal through Profound Lore Records in 2015. History Musician Aaron Turner started working on new material that would eventually become Sumac with the intention of writing some of the heaviest music he'd ever created. After creating the skeletons of a handful of songs, he turned to Kurt Ballou of Converge and asked if he knew of a drummer that would fit well with the music he wrote. Ballou, who worked with the Canadian crust-punk band Baptists in April 2014 to record their second studio album Bloodmines, recommended Baptists drummer Nick Yacyshyn. Turner and Yacyshyn jammed together and clicked, and Yacyshyn commented that the music they were working on was, \\"a pretty dense, heavy experience and kind of out there, I'd say. I've never been in a band that sounds like this.\\" Even though both members were a part of other projects at the time, Turner announced that Sumac would attempt to be a full-time band that would continue to write, record and tour, instead of being just a side band. After only playing together twice prior, Sumac performed their first show on stage in December 2014 opening for Deafheaven in Vancouver, British Columbia. Sumac released its six-song debut album titled The Deal on February 17, 2015 through Profound Lore Records with Turner's own SIGE Records handling the vinyl pressing. Turner invited Brian Cook to be a session bassist for The Deal and \\"an auxiliary/intermittent member for live performances when possible,\\" although he quickly became a full member of the band. The album was recorded by Mell Dettmer (Sunn O))), Earth) in Seattle, Washington and mastered by Ballou in Salem, Massachusetts. To promote the album, Sumac released the tracks \\"Thorn in the Lion's Paw\\" and \\"Blight's End Angel\\" for online streaming prior to its release. The band embarked on a short North American tour in support of The Deal in March 2015. In February 2016, one year after the band released its debut album, Sumac announced they had signed to Thrill Jockey for the release of their second studio album. The new album, titled What One Becomes, was released on June 10, 2016 and is said to examine Turner's \\"internal and personal struggles with anxiety.\\" On December 9, 2016 the band released 4-track EP titled Before You I Appear which featured remixes of songs from What One Becomes by such artists as Samuel Kerridge, Bleed Turquoise, Endon and Kevin Drumm. In November 2017, Sumac announced the release of a collaborative album with Japanese multi-instrumentalist Keiji Haino titled American Dollar Bill ‚Äì Keep Facing Sideways, You're Too Hideous to Look at Face On. The album was recorded in summer 2017 in Tokyo‚Äôs Goksound recording studio as \\"a series of unrehearsed, completely non-premeditated sessions\\" and was released on February 23, 2018.

The Court held that, when reviewing a district court‚Äôs resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the Federal Circuit must apply a ‚Äúclear error,‚Äù not a de novo, standard of review. Facts and procedural history The case originated in the Southern District of New York, where Sandoz sued to invalidate Teva's patent on a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In the Markman hearing, Sandoz argued that a claim was fatally indefinite for failing to identify which of three possible meanings a particular claim term, related to the molecular weight of a component of the drug, should be interpreted to have. The district court judge held that the claim term was definite, and that a \\"person of ordinary skill in the art\\" would interpret the term \\"molecular weight\\" to mean the \\"peak average molecular weight\\", that is, the weight of the molecule most prevalent in the mixture. In doing so, the judge relied in part on expert witness testimony. Sandoz appealed to the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the claim under a 'de novo' standard, decided that the claim term was fatally indefinite, and hence that the patent was invalid. Teva appealed to the US Supreme Court and won.

Born in Dorohoi, his father Teofil was a German-language teacher who came from Hliboka (Ad√¢ncata) in Austrian-ruled Bukovina. His mother, Terezia (n√©e Kernbach), came from a family of German doctors. He attended primary school in his native town, followed by gymnasium at Pom√¢rla from 1907 to 1911. Between 1919 and 1921, he attended the Fine Arts Academy in Ia»ôi, followed by the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest from 1921 to 1923. There, one of his professors was Dimitrie Paciurea. Following his graduation, he found a position at Brad, in the »öara Mo»õilor area of Transylvania, as a teacher of calligraphy and drawing. Spending three years there, Olinescu became fascinated by the local lifestyle, producing ten engravings centered on the local gold-mining industry. He also drew portraits featuring leaders of the Transylvanian Revolution of 1848, after earlier paintings by Barbu Iscovescu. In 1925, together with Dumitru Ghia»õƒÉ, he hosted an exhibition of his »öara Mo»õilor work at the Romanian Athenaeum, also publishing an album.Gabor, p.867 In 1926, Olinescu went to Boto»ôani to teach at A.

From 1933 to 1937, he edited the local »òtirea newspaper, while in 1931, he co-founded an artistic society in Arad. Together with other members, who included Gheorghe Ciuhandu, he edited the literary and cultural magazine Hotarul, in 24 pages, which first appeared in 1933. Starting in October 1934, he also edited Duh, a magazine focused on art, literary criticism and philosophy. He worked on Dimitrie Gusti's sociological research teams. Sculpting in an improvised workshop in the courtyard of his school, he executed busts of the local pedagogue Petre Pipo»ô and of a newspaperman from »òtirea. He also produced a bust of 1784 revolutionary Cri»ôan, after a contemporary oil painting; this was placed in Vaca, the revolutionary's native village. While at Arad, he published a volume of verse. He left the city in 1937, teaching in Bucharest between that year and 1958.Olinescu, p.2 Olinescu took part in drawing exhibitions with the Grupul Grafic society in 1940, 1943 and 1946.

It was known as Olympus (; also transliterated as Olympos) and Phoenicus or Phoinikous () in ancient times. It is part of the Beydaƒülarƒ± Coastal National Park. Visitors can ascend the summit with the Olympos Aerial Tram. The Lycian Way long distance trail traverses the mountain.

Its close proximity to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea makes it far visible to mariners. It is the highest mountain in the Natural Park of Olympos - Beydaƒülarƒ± - Milli Park. From November to often into June, the summit is covered with ice and snow. In the spring of this snow layer is often reddish brown colored by Sahara winds, while it is often not seen in the summer because of the clouds. The vegetation-free zone starts at about 1900 meters height. History In ancient times the mountain was called Olympus, the home of the gods, a name it shares with many other high mountains. Nearby, was a town of the same name. On the Lycian Olympus stood a temple of Hephaestus.Comp.

The ruins of the ancient city of Phaselis lie at the foot of Tahtalƒ±. Today's Turkish name could derive from tahta (Turkish: wooden panel, wooden board), but more likely it derives from the Turkish taht (\\"throne\\" in Turkish, referring to Olympus as the throne of the Gods). Funicular Olympos Teleferik The cable car company Olympos Teleferik, a Turkish-Swiss Cooperation, has been in operation since June 16, 2007. It owns one cable car line leading to the summit of Tahtalƒ±. Its bottom station is located within 8 km of both Tekirova and √áamyuva on the eastern side of the mountain. With a length of 4350 meters, the Olympos Teleferik is one of the longer aerial tramways. It was built by the Doppelmayr / Garaventa Group, one of the leading companies in the design and manufacture of cable cars. In order to transport the materials up the mountain, a simple ropeway was built. The materials consisted of approximately 3,700 cubic meters of concrete, 4,500 cubic meters of water, 420 tons of steel and 8,600 tons of gravel. The funicular has two cabins able to transport up to 80 individuals and overcome the height difference of 1639 m within 10 minutes with the help of a 1000 kW engine. The cabins are carried by two supporting cables having a diameter of 51 mm which are pulled by a cord with a diameter of 38 mm. The cables pass the four cable car towers with a maximum speed of 10 m/s (36 km/h). This setup enables the Olympos Teleferik to transport up to 480 people per hour.

Weaver owned Tre Piani, which is now closed, an Italian restaurant in the Forrestal Village section of Plainsboro, New Jersey, near US Route 1. In 2004, he served as New Jersey's representative to the first Great American Seafood Cook-off at the Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. Several years later, Weaver published his first book, Locavore Adventures: One Chef's Slow Food Journey. Locavore Adventures discusses his experiences with learning to use local ingredients in cooking. Early life and education Weaver was born in New Vernon, a community in Harding Township, New Jersey. His family lived in a house built by his father in a wooded area of the town. In 1981, Weaver graduated from Morristown-Beard School in Morristown, New Jersey. He then completed his bachelor's degree at New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University) in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1985. Taking after his father, Weaver initially chose to study architecture in college. After taking a few classes in that subject, he switched his major to hotel and restaurant management. In 1991, Weaver took a trip to Italy that helped him learning cooking techniques. He learned to cook seafood under the tutelage of a chef at La Guzzina in Milan. During the trip, Weaver also practiced cooking multi-course meals while staying with friends in Rome. They purchased the ingredients for the meals at the marketplace at Campo de' Fiori. Cooking career Weaver served as the executive chef at Panico's in New Brunswick, New Jersey, from 1989 to 1998. He then founded Tre Piani, where he rose again to become one of the areas best chefs> While working at Panico's, Weaver experimented with a new style of Italian cuisine, which later became the mainstay of Tre Piani. He sought to make heavy use of fresh, locally grown ingredients from nearby farms in New Jersey. While running his restaurant, Weaver has volunteered in cooking activities to reduce childhood hunger. He has held Taste of the Nation events at Tre Piani to benefit Share Our Strength, a national nonprofit organization that focuses on reducing childhood hunger. In 2003, Share Our Strength awarded Weaver their Chef of the Year Award. Slow Food movement in New Jersey In 1999, Weaver founded Slow Food Central New Jersey as Slow Food International's sixth U.S. chapter. In August of that year, he held an event at Tre Piani called Har-Fest. Weaver invited chefs at local restaurants in New Jersey to offer free tastings of food made using local, seasonal ingredients. The event, which amassed a crowd of 500 people, included tomato farmers, cheese producers, beekeepers, and cranberry producers. The event helped convince Slow Food international to invest in the growth of Slow Food USA, which started in 2000.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has a dark green and white striped flower and is known from only three locations. It is therefore listed as an endangered species. Description Pterostylis metcalfei has a rosette of 3 to 5 leaves, each leaf long, wide, dark green and flat. The flower stem is 1 long and bears a single flower long and wide and shiny, greenish-white with darker green stripes. The dorsal sepal is erect at its base but then arches forward, forming a hood over the labellum and has a threadlike tip, long. The labellum is blunt, sharply kinked in the middle and is long and about wide. Flowering occurs from March to May.Front view of Pterostylis metcalfei Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis metcalfei was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1997 from a specimen collected by Peter Metcalfe on Doughboy Mountain, about south of Wongwibindi station, on the road to Wollomombi, on 8 May 1994. The description was published in The Orchadian. In 2002, Jones and Clements transferred the species to the genus Diplodium but the move has not been accepted by the National Herbarium of New South Wales nor by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The specific epithet (metcalfei) honours the collector of the type specimen, Peter Metcalfe. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to the New England Tablelands (biogeographic region) at altitudes of . It is found on ridges and slopes with well drained soil derived from granite and basalt, growing among grass and shrubs. It is known from only three locations, only one of which is in a national park, so that it is threatened by cattle grazing and trampling. Conservation status The Scientific Committee of the Office of Environment and Heritage, established by the Threatened Species Conservation Act, has listed P. metcalfei as an Endangered Species on Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act.

A recipient of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, Cowsik was honored by the Government of India, in 2002, with the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri Biography TIFR main campus Ramanath Cowsik was born in 1940 in Nagpur, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. He did his schooling in Karnataka which he completed before turning 14 and graduated from Mysore University in 1958, with physics, chemistry and biology as the optional subjects, at the age of 17. He continued his master's studies at the Karnatak university in Dharwar, to secure the degree in physics in 1960, aged 19 and joined the Atomic Energy Establishment Training School, present day Homi Bhabha National Institute, Trombay where he did a post graduate course. He started his career as a member of faculty of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1961, simultaneously pursuing his doctoral studies to secure a PhD from Bombay University in 1968, researching under the guidance of Professor Yash Pal. He taught at TIFR for over forty years, growing over the years as a fellow, a reader, an associate professor, a professor, a senior professor, and reaching the status of a distinguished professor of the institute. He also worked as the Director of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics on deputation from TIFR, during the period from 1992 to 2003, where he has been a Vainu Bappu Distinguished Professor. On invitation from P. Buford Price, Cowsik also worked as an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley from 1970 to 1973. In December 2002, he moved to Washington University in St. Louis and serves at the McDonnell Centre for the Space Sciences as the Professor of Physics and Director. He is the James S. McDonnell Professor of Space Sciences of the institute since 2013. A former research fellow of the University of Chicago, Cowsik is a visiting professor at the University of California and a visiting fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics, Munich. He has also served as a member of the governing council of the Commission on Cosmic Rays of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. He is a member of the International Society for Science and Religion and sits in the board of advisors of Forgiveness Research, a community of forgiveness. Cowsik, who is known to be proficient in languages such as Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, Sanskrit, English, German and French, is married to Sudha, a research instructor and a doctoral degree (PhD) holder, associated with the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics of the Washington University in St. Louis. Cowsik has two sons, Sasha and Aditya, and resides in the city of St. Louis. Legacy Dark matter is invisible. Based on the effect of 263x263px Ramanath Cowsik is known for his theories related to the Big Bang origin of the universe. He argued that, post the Big Bang, gravitationally dominant relicts were formed from the particles with finite rest mass, resulting in the formation of halos of dark matter with galaxies embedded within. He postulated that this would limit the sums of masses of neutrinos, a phenomenon known in the scientific world as the Cowsik-McClelland bound. These theories are said to have explained the velocity dispersion of particles of dark matter and reproduced the luminosity profiles and ratified the rotation curves of galaxies. Cowsik is credited with the invention of leaky box and nested leaky box models for the observation of optical and infrared wavelength bands of cosmic rays and employing these models, he is known to have established an observatory for optical astronomy in Hanle, Ladakh, at an altitude of 15,000 feet, reported to be the highest observatory in the world. The observatory is controlled remotely from Bangalore and is operational year round. He is involved in experiments related to Grand Unified Theory and attempts to probe violations of the inverse square law of gravity at sub-millimeter scales. His scientific paper on the role of neutrinos was included by the American Physical Society and the Physics Review magazine, in their selection of 1000 most important scientific papers of the century. Cowsik has reported contributions towards understanding highly energetic phenomena in astrophysics such as cosmic ray, pulsar, supernova remnant, gamma ray burst, active galactic nucleus and other similar sources powered by accretion flows. His studies cover the diffuse non thermal radiations found all over space as well as radiations from discrete astronomical sources. His experiments are known to be interdisciplinary in nature and bridge the gap between universal phenomena and experimental physics. He has conducted extensive research on pre-solar grains of aluminum oxide found in meteorites and has devised a methodology to assess the age of the universe from them. Ramanath Cowsik is credited with the first detailed calculations on neutrino fluxes generated atmospheric cosmic ray interactions and observations of the same in underground detectors. These findings have been known to have assisted in the discovery of neutrino oscillations at Super-Kamiokande observatory in Japan. He is also known to have made the longest half-life measured in the world which related to that of double beta decay of Te-128, as 7.7 x 1024 years. He has also conducted studies on finite temperature corrections to the Casimir forces occur at large separations. Cowsik has developed a sensitive torsion balance using which he conducted the first laboratory experiment for the so-called fifth force. He is involved in the development of a more sensitive torsion balance for probing the violations of the Inverse-square law of gravity at millimeter scales, Cowsik, who has drawn comparison with the renowned physicist, Enrico Fermi for his achievements in theoretical and experimental physics, has published his experiments and observations in several scientific papers published in peer reviewed journals and ResearchGate, an online repository has listed 193 of them. He has attended several seminars and conferences and has delivered keynote addresses on astrophysics and the relationship between religion and science. He has edited three books, including \\"Cosmic Pathways\\", a collection of essays in physics and astrophysics. He has also assisted other scientists in ratifying their experiments by acting as a reference point; his involvement in the OPERA experiment, a CERN, Geneva and the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Gran Sasso collaboration was one such instance. Awards and recognitions Ramanath Cowsik is an elected Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, India, Indian Geophysical Union and The Academy of Sciences for the Developing World. He is a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, a life member of the American Physical Society and a member of the International Astronomical Union. Cowsik received the Shri Hari Om Prerit Vikram Sarabhai Award in 1981, followed by Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in 1984. NASA awarded him the Public Service Group Achievement Award in 1986 and the Indian National Science Academy awarded him the Vainu Bappu Memorial Medal in 1997. The Government of India honoured him with the civilian award of Padma Shri in 2002 and he received the M. P. Birla Award in 2007. He is also a recipient of TWAS Prize and the ISCA S. N.
