He variously gave his birth year as 1909 to 1913. His Kentucky prison record states he was born October 16, 1909, but this might have been an approximation. The birthdate on his death certificate is blank. The 1910 United States Census for Bethea Township, Dillon County, South Carolina, lists a \\"Rainey Bethea,\\" age 5, step son of Strans Bethea and son of Beulah Bethea. Similarly, a Rainey Bethea, Jr., age 11, son of Rainey Bethea, Sr., appears in the 1920 United States Census for Reaves Township, Marion County, South Carolina. - August 14, 1936) was the last person publicly executed in the United States. Bethea, who confessed to the rape and murder of a 70-year-old woman named Lischia Edwards, was convicted of her rape and publicly hanged in Owensboro, Kentucky. Mistakes in performing the hanging, and the surrounding media circus, contributed to the end of public executions in the United States. Early life Little is known about Bethea's life before he arrived in Owensboro in 1933. Born around 1909 in Roanoke, Virginia, Bethea was an African-American man orphaned after the death of his mother in 1919 and his father in 1926. He worked for the Rutherford family and lived in their basement for about a year, and then he moved to a cabin behind the house of a man named Emmett Wells. He worked as a laborer and later rented a room from a woman, Mrs. Charles Brown. He also attended a Baptist church. Bethea first interacted with the legal system in 1935, when he was charged with breach of the peace and then fined $20. In April of the same year, he was caught stealing two purses from an establishment called the Vogue Beauty Shop. Since the value of the purses exceeded $25, Bethea was convicted of a felony, grand larceny, and consequently sentenced to one year in the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville. He arrived there on June 1, 1935, and his prison physical exam information describes him as 5 ft. 4‚Öú\\" (1.635 m) tall and weighing . He gained parole half a year later on December 1, 1935. Upon returning to Owensboro upon release, Bethea continued to work as a laborer and earned about seven dollars per week. Less than a month later, he was arrested again for house breaking. On January 6, 1936, the court amended this charge to being drunk and disorderly in public and imposed a $100 fine (equivalent to $ in ). Because he could not afford to pay, he remained incarcerated in the Daviess County Jail until April 18, 1936. Crime and arrest During the early morning of June 7, 1936, Bethea entered the home of Lischia Edwards at 322 East Fifth StreetElvis Presley Passed Here - Even More Locations of America's Pop Culture Landmarks; by Chris Epting, pg. 113 by climbing onto the roof of an outbuilding next door. From there, he jumped onto the roof of the servant's quarters of Emmett Wells' house, and then walked down a wooden walkway. He climbed over the kitchen roof to Edwards' bedroom window. After removing a screen from her window, he entered the room, waking her. Bethea then choked Edwards and violently raped her. After she was unconscious, he searched for valuables and stole several of her rings. In the process, he removed his own black celluloid prison ring, and failed to later retrieve it. He left the bedroom and hid the stolen jewels in a barn not far from the house. The crime was discovered late that morning after the Smith family, who lived downstairs, noticed they had not heard Edwards stirring in her room. They feared she might have been ill and knocked on the door of her room, attempting to rouse her. They found the door locked with a key still inside the lock from the inside, which prevented another key from being placed in the lock from the outside. They contacted a neighbor, Robert Richardson, hoping he could help, and he managed to knock the key free, but another skeleton key would not unlock the door. Smith then got a ladder. He climbed into the room through the transom over the door and discovered that Edwards was dead. The Smiths alerted Dr. George Barr while he was attending a service at the local Methodist Church. Dr. Barr realized there was little he could do and summoned the local coroner, Delbert Glenn, who attended the same church. The Smiths also called the Owensboro police. Officers found the room was otherwise tidy, but there were muddy footprints everywhere. Coroner Glenn also found Bethea's celluloid prison ring. By late Sunday afternoon, the police already suspected Rainey Bethea after several residents of Owensboro stated that they had previously seen Bethea wearing the ring. Since Bethea had a criminal record, the police could use the then-new identification technique of fingerprints to establish that Bethea had recently touched items inside the bedroom. Police searched for Bethea over the next four days. On the Wednesday following the discovery of the murder, Burt \\"Red\\" Figgins was working on the bank of the Ohio River, when he observed Bethea lying under some bushes. Figgins asked Bethea what he was doing, and Bethea responded he was \\"cooling off.\\" Figgins then reported this sighting to his supervisor, Will Faith, and asked him to call the police. By the time Faith had returned to the spot on the river bank, Bethea had moved to the nearby Koll's Grocery. Faith followed him and then found a policeman in the drugstore, but when they searched for Bethea, he again eluded capture. Later that afternoon, Bethea was again spotted. This time, he was cornered on the river bank after he tried to board a barge. When police officers questioned him, he denied that he was Bethea, claiming his name was James Smith. The police played along with the fabricated name, fearing a mob would develop if residents were to learn that they had captured Bethea. After his arrest, Bethea was identified by a scar on the left side of his head. Trial, appeal, and petition for habeas corpus =Trial= Jefferson County Jail Judge Forrest A. Roby of the Daviess Circuit Court ordered the sheriff to transport Bethea to the Jefferson County Jail in Louisville. While being transferred, Bethea made his first confession, admitting that he had raped Edwards and strangled her to death. Bethea also lamented the fact that he had made a mistake by leaving his ring at the crime scene. Once incarcerated at the jail, Bethea made a second confession to Robert M. Morton, a notary public, and George H. Koper, a reporter for The Courier-Journal. On June 12, 1936, Bethea confessed a third time, telling the guards where he had hidden the jewelry. Owensboro police searched a barn in Owensboro and found the jewelry where Bethea said he had left it. Under Kentucky law, the grand jury could not convene until June 22, and the prosecutor charged Bethea solely with rape. Under extant state statutes, executions for murder and robbery were carried out by electrocution at the state penitentiary in Eddyville. Rape, however, could be punished by public hanging in the county seat where the crime occurred. The prosecutor therefore elected to charge Bethea only with rape in order to avoid a potential legal dilemma as to whether Bethea would be hanged or electrocuted. Bethea was never charged with the remaining crimes of theft, robbery, burglary, giving a false name to police, or murder. After one hour and forty minutes, the grand jury returned an indictment, charging Bethea with rape. On June 25, 1936, officers returned Bethea to Owensboro for the trial, which took place that same day. Bethea asserted a Clyde Maddox would provide an alibi, but Maddox claimed he did not know Bethea. The defense subpoenaed four witnesses: Maddox, Ladd Moorman, Willie Johnson (a supposed accomplice given Bethea's statements), and Allen McDaniel. The first three were served, with McDaniel excluded because the sheriff's office could not find a person named Allen McDaniel. On the night before the trial, Bethea announced to his lawyers that he wanted to plead guilty, doing so the next day at the start of the trial. The prosecutor still presented the state's case to the jury in spite of the guilty plea, requesting a death penalty for Bethea. In his opening statement, Commonwealth's Attorney Herman Birkhead said, \\"This is one of the most dastardly, beastly, cowardly crimes ever committed in Daviess County. Justice demands and the Commonwealth will ask and expect a verdict of the death penalty by hanging.\\" After questioning 21 witnesses, the prosecution closed its case. The defense did not present or examine any witnesses. After a closing statement by the prosecutor, the judge instructed the jury that since Bethea had pleaded guilty, they must \\"...fix his punishment, at confinement in the penitentiary for not less than ten years nor more than twenty years, or at death.\\" After only four and a half minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a sentence of death by hanging. Bethea was then quickly removed from the courthouse and returned to the Jefferson County Jail. =Appeal and petition for habeas corpus= Back in Louisville, Bethea acquired five new African- American lawyers to try to save his life: Charles Ewbank Tucker, Stephen A. Burnley, Charles W. Anderson Jr., Harry E. Bonaparte, and R. Everett Ray. They worked pro bono to challenge the sentence, which they saw as their ethical duty for the indigent defendant who could not pay standard legal fees. On July 10, 1936, they filed a motion for a new trial. The judge summarily denied this on the grounds that under Section 273 of the Kentucky Code of Practice in Criminal Cases, a motion for a new trial had to have been received before the end of the court's term, which had ended on July 4. Bethea's team then tried to appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was also not in session at that time. On July 29, Justice Gus Thomas returned to Frankfort where he heard the oral motion. Justice Thomas refused to let them file the appeal, on the grounds that the trial court record was incomplete since it only included the judge's ruling. While the lawyers knew that the Kentucky courts would deny the appeal, they filed it anyway as a formality in order to exhaust the state court remedies available to them before they filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in a federal court. Once Thomas denied the motion to file a belated appeal, Bethea's attorneys filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky at Louisville. On August 5, a hearing was held at the Federal Building in Louisville before United States District Judge Elwood Hamilton. During the hearing, Bethea claimed that he had pled guilty unwillingly and had wanted to subpoena three witnesses to testify on his behalf, but his initial lawyers had forced him to plead guilty and did not have the desired witnesses testify. He also claimed that his five confessions had been made under duress and that he had signed one confession unaware of what he was signing. The Commonwealth brought several witnesses to refute these claims. Ultimately, Judge Hamilton denied the habeas corpus petition and ruled that the hanging could proceed. Execution Sheriff Florence Thompson The crime was infamous locally, but came to nationwide attention because the sheriff of Daviess County was a woman. Florence Shoemaker Thompson had become sheriff on April 13, 1936, after her husband, sheriff Everett Thompson, unexpectedly died of pneumonia on April 10. Florence became sheriff through widow's succession, and as sheriff of the county she was tasked with hanging Bethea. Arthur L. Hash, a former Louisville police officer, offered his services free of charge to perform the execution. Thompson accepted this offer. He asked that she not make his name public. On August 6, the Governor of Kentucky, Albert Chandler, signed Bethea's execution warrant and set the execution for sunrise on August 14. Thompson requested the governor to issue a revised death warrant because the original warrant specified that the hanging would take place in the courthouse yard where the county had recently planted new shrubs and flowers. Chandler was out-of-state, so Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky Keen Johnson, as acting governor, signed a second death warrant moving the location of the hanging from the courthouse yard to an empty lot near the county garage. Rainey Bethea's last meal consisted of fried chicken, pork chops, mashed potatoes, pickled cucumbers, cornbread, lemon pie, and ice cream, which he ate at 4:00 p.m. on August 13 in Louisville. At about 1:00 a.m., Daviess County deputy sheriffs transported Bethea from Louisville to Owensboro. At the jail, professional hangman Phil Hanna of Epworth, Ill visited Bethea and instructed him to stand on the X that would be marked on the trapdoor. It was estimated that a crowd of about 20,000 people gathered to watch the execution. Hash arrived at the site intoxicated wearing a white suit and a white Panama hat. At this time, no one but he and Thompson knew that he would pull the trigger. Bethea left the Daviess County Jail at 5:21 a.m. and walked with two deputies to the scaffold. Within two minutes, he was at the base of the scaffold. Removing his shoes, he put on a new pair of socks. He ascended the steps and stood on the large X as instructed. After Bethea made his final confession to Father Lammers of the Cathedral of the Assumption in Louisville, officers placed a black hood over his head and fastened three large straps around his ankles, thighs, arms, and chest. Hanna placed the noose around Bethea's neck, adjusted it, and then signaled to Hash to pull the trigger. Instead, Hash, who was drunk, did nothing. Hanna shouted at Hash, \\"Do it!\\" and a deputy leaned onto the trigger, which sprang the trap door. Two doctors confirmed Bethea was dead. His body was taken to Andrew & Wheatley Funeral Home. He wanted his body to be sent to his sister in South Carolina, but against these wishes, he was buried in a pauper's grave at the Rosehill Elmwood Cemetery in Owensboro. Afterwards, Hanna complained that Hash should not have been allowed to perform the execution in his drunken condition. Hanna further said it was the worst display he experienced in the 70 hangings he had supervised. End of public executions in the United States As the Kentucky General Assembly had been meeting in its biennial sessions at the time, the media circus surrounding the Bethea execution embarrassed members of the Kentucky legislature. In spite of the humiliation, they could not amend laws regarding executions until the next session in 1938. However, the trial judges in two separate Kentucky rape cases ordered that the hangings of John \\"Pete\\" Montjoy and Harold Van Venison be conducted privately. Montjoy, age 23, was privately hanged in Covington on December 17, 1937. On January 17, 1938, William R. Attkisson of the Kentucky State Senate's 38th District (representing Louisville), introduced Senate Bill 69, repealing the requirement in Section 1137 that executions for convicted rapists be conducted by hanging in the county seat where they raped their victims. The bill was promoted in the Kentucky House of Representatives by Representative Charles W. Anderson Jr., one of the attorneys who assisted Bethea in his post-conviction relief motions. After both houses approved the bill, Governor Chandler signed it into law on March 12, 1938; it became effective on May 30 of that year. Chandler later expressed regret at having approved the repeal, claiming, \\"Our streets are no longer safe.\\" The last person ever legally hanged in Kentucky was Harold Van Venison, a 33-year-old African-American singer, who was privately executed in Covington on June 3, 1938.

Operaci√≥n 90 (Operation NINETY) was the first Argentine ground expedition to the South Pole, conducted in 1965, by ten soldiers of the Argentine Army under then-Colonel Jorge Edgard Leal. It was performed to attempt to cement Argentina's claims to a portion of Antarctica, as well as for scientific reasons and to perfect polar exploration techniques. The operation was named for the target 90 degree South latitude point (the geographic South Pole). Leal's team departed on six snowcat vehicles (believed to be Tucker Sno Cat based on the spelling used) from General Belgrano Army Base on October 26, 1965.

General Leal and his men, shortly after arriving to the South Pole, were met by a radar operator from the US Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station, who asked them who they were and what they were doing there.

The centerpieces of the site, which is operated by the National Park Service, are the Truman Home in Independence and the Truman Farm Home in Grandview, although it also includes the Noland home of Truman's cousins and the George and Frank Wallace homes of Bess Truman's brothers. The site was designated a National Historic Site on May 23, 1983.Park Management ‚Äì National Park Service Truman Home in Independence The Truman Home (earlier known as the Gates‚ÄìWallace home), 219 North Delaware Street, Independence, Missouri, was the home of Harry S. Truman from the time of his marriage to Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919, until his death on December 26, 1972. Bess Truman's maternal grandfather, George Porterfield Gates, built the house between the years 1867 and 1885. Truman's home in Independence, Missouri After Bess's father, David Willock Wallace, committed suicide in 1903, she and her mother and brothers moved into the house with Bess's grandparents, George and Elizabeth Gates. At the time Harry and Bess married in 1919, Harry was putting all of his money into his business partnership, a men's clothing store called Truman & Jacobson at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City, so living at the Wallace home made good financial sense. After Truman's haberdashery failed in 1922, he and his wife continued to live in the house to save money while he paid his debts. After being elected to the Senate in 1935, he moved to Washington, D.C. with his wife and daughter. Whenever they came back to Missouri, the house at 219 N. Delaware was their home. After he retired in 1953, until the Truman Library was opened on July 6, 1957, the Truman Home served as Mr. Truman's personal office. Bess lived in the home until her death in 1982, and she bequeathed the property to the National Park Service. The home was closed for 8 months in 2009-10 for a $1.1 million renovation that improved fire safety, visitor comfort and structural stability.Truman home open again for tours , The (Independence, Mo.) Examiner, May 31, 2010 The Truman Home offers a glimpse at the personal life of the 33rd President of the United States, particularly the simple life the family enjoyed in Independence before and after Harry's eight years as President. The Trumans' only child, Mary Margaret, was born in the home on February 17, 1924. The site also includes the two adjacent homes of Mrs. Truman's brothers, and, across Delaware Street, the Noland Home, where the President's favorite aunt and cousins lived. The site operates a visitor's center, located inside an historic firehouse, in downtown Independence. NPS park ranger-interpreters lead guided tours of the home on a regular basis, providing a look at the home much as the Truman family left it.HSTNHS Things To Do ‚Äì National Park Service The second-floor bedroom of Harry and Bess Truman, in their home in Independence, Missouri. The second floor of the home has never been open to the public ‚Äì Bess wrote into her will that to protect her family's privacy, the second floor was to remain closed until the death of her daughter, Margaret. Though Margaret died in 2008, the NPS has maintained the closure in order to best preserve the home.Truman Home Second Floor Photo Tour, National Park Service A photo tour of the closed rooms, including Harry and Bess's bedroom, is available. On display in the ground floor of the home is the Steinway piano Truman originally purchased as a Christmas present for Margaret, and which was played by Truman in the White House; a portion of the Trumans' extensive personal library (including the mysteries preferred by Bess); the family record collection; the official White House portrait of the First Lady (the one in Washington D.C. is a copy): and paintings including a panorama of Athens, Greece, a \\"primitive\\" of Key West featuring palm trees and a backward-looking donkey, and a canvas entitled \\"Swan River.\\" The fireplace is framed with tiles depicting a fanciful Middle Eastern desert landscape with tents and minarets, likely inspired by One Thousand and One Nights. Truman is one of the few Presidents who never owned his own home prior to his time in office. He lived with his parents until he married, then in the Wallace House, in rented apartments and houses in Washington (including 4701 Connecticut Avenue), in Blair House (the official state visitors residence), and in the White House, but it was not until July 1953, following his term of office and the December 1952 death of Madge Gates Wallace, that Harry and Bess Truman purchased the home at 219 North Delaware Street. The house is now located in the Harry S. Truman Historic District, a National Historic Landmark District. Truman Farm Home in Grandview Truman's farm home in Grandview, Missouri The Harry S. Truman Farm Home is located 15 miles (24 km) away from Independence in Grandview, Missouri. A National Historic Landmark, the farmhouse at 12301 Blue Ridge Blvd. was built in 1894 by Harry Truman's maternal grandmother, and is the centerpiece of a remnant of the family's former farm. Truman worked the farm as a young man, from 1906‚Äì1917. It was here, said his mother, that Harry got his \\"common sense.\\" There is no visitor center on the site, but the grounds are open year-round for self-guided tours, and an audio tour is available. Guided tours were formerly conducted during the summer, but were cancelled in 2013 due to sequestration-related budget cuts.Sequestration Cuts at Park, National Park Service The site consists of a two-story farm house; a reconstructed smokehouse; the Grandview post office- turned-garage (Truman moved it to the farm to store his 1911 Stafford automobile); a restored box wagon once used on the farm; and several stone fence posts marking the original boundaries of the farm, plus other original and reconstructed buildings. After Truman returned to private life he sold portions of the farm for the Truman Corners Shopping Center as well as other Kansas City suburban development.

Named after her great-aunt Blanche of Castile, queen of France, Blanche was the Lady of Las Huelgas, Montemor-o-Velho, Alcocer and Briviesca, the city which she founded.  Biographical sketch  Born in Santar√©m, when Blanche was two years old, her father gave her, as a perpetual donation, the city of Montemor-o-Velho with the condition that it would revert to the crown upon her death or in the event that she married outside of Portugal. Following the footsteps of her great-aunt, queen Theresa of Portugal, Queen of Le√≥n and other female members of the royal house and nobility, she went to live at the Monastery of Lorv√£o in 1277 although at that time she was not a nun and was never the abbess of this religious establishment. In 1282, she accompanied her mother, Queen Beatrice, to Castile, due to differences with her brother King Denis of Portugal and coinciding with the conflict between her maternal grandfather, King Alfonso X and infante Sancho, the future King Sancho IV. There is documentary proof that mother and daughter were living in 1283 in Seville with the king who in his will mentioned his granddaughter Blanche and left her a substantial sum for her marriage. In 1295, she became a nun at the Convent of Las Huelgas, as evidenced by a letter dated 15 April 1295 detailing the reasons that led her to become a nun at the recommendation and instructions of her uncle King Sancho IV of Castile, even though at first she had been reluctant to enter the religious order. Colegiata de Santa Maria in Briviesca founded by infanta Blanche \\"Fuero de Briviesca\\" (1313). She brought to the convent her dowry which consisted of several villages and properties and in 1303 donated to the convent the salt mines at Poza de la Sal and at A√±ana. Called the lady and keeper of the convent, Blanche was never its abbess, since during that time, between 1296 and 1326, Las Huelgas was governed by abbess Urraca Alfonso. In 1303, upon her mother's death, Blanche inherited the se√±or√≠o of Alcocer. On 27 September 1305, she purchased for 170,000 maraved√≠es from Juana G√≥mez de Manzanedo, the widow of infante Louis, son of Ferdinand III of Castile, her inheritance in the city of Briviesca. She is considered the founder of the city as its sponsor and coordinator, and was also responsible for the founding of Colegiata de Santa Mar√≠a. \\"Her work was not limited to the urban planning of the new city, the layout of its streets (...) she also granted it a legal instrument for its governance and administration, the Fuero of 1313, which was inspired by the text of the Royal Fuero\\".  Will, death, and burial  Blanche's tomb at Las Huelgas Convent. She executed a will on 15 April 1321 where she ordered her burial at the Convent of Las Huelgas and also asked that ten thousand masses were to be celebrated for the good of her soul. In her will, she granted the city of Briviesca to King Alfonso XI of Castile with the condition that the city was never to be a se√±or√≠o, that the king was to pay her debts totalling 300,000 maraved√≠s, and entrusted him with the protection of the city and of the Colegitata de Santa Mar√≠a la Mayor which she had founded. Blanche named several executors of her will, including Queen Mar√≠a de Molina and Gonzalo de Hinojosa, the bishop of Burgos. Infanta Blanche died at the Convent on 17 April 1321. Her sepulchre is decorated with intertwined stars and with the arms of the kingdoms of Castile, Le√≥n, and of the Kingdom of Portugal.  Issue  She had a son out of wedlock by a Portuguese nobleman named Pedro Nunes Carpinteiro, or Pedro Estevanez Carpenteyro as recorded in the chronicles of Rui de Pina and of Alfonso XI: * Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado, Master of the Order of Calatrava and vassal of King Alfonso XI of Castile and his son King Pedro of Castile, who had him killed in 1355 at the castle in Maqueda.

This form of collusion is illegal in most countries. It is a form of price fixing and market allocation, often practiced where contracts are determined by a call for bids, for example in the case of government construction contracts. The typical objective of bid rigging is to enable the \\"winning\\" party to obtain contracts at uncompetitive prices (i.e., at higher prices if they are sellers, or lower prices if they are buyers). The other parties are compensated in various ways, for example, by cash payments, or by being designated to be the \\"winning\\" bidder on other contracts, or by an arrangement where some parts of the successful bidder's contract will be subcontracted to them. In this way, they \\"share the spoils\\" among themselves. Bid rigging almost always results in economic harm to the agency which is seeking the bids, and to the public, who ultimately bear the costs as taxpayers or consumers. Forms of Bid Rigging  = Bid Rigging as acts of corruption = * Change order abuse occurs when a contractor colludes with project officials, wins a low bid, then asks to change the contract afterwards. This is approved by officials, resulting in a much higher bid being retroactively approved. * Bidder Exclusion allows project officials to essentially choose their bid. There are multiple methods to achieve this end including: ** Instituting unreasonable qualification parameters, excluding non-preferred firms, or effectuating the same by shortening the time of acceptance periods for new bids following a request. ** Advertising projects to select bidders or bidding markets, thereby reducing publicity of bid procurement. ** Bundling of contracts to exclude bidders. ** Coercion and intimidation can also be used or simply rejection of individual bids over trivial matters. * Purchase splitting to reduce the minimum bid amount. This functions as contracts are split up to reduce the actual procurement amount and keep it under a threshold value. This reduces competitive bidding and enables less oversight at the project level as bid prices drop and kickbacks can be allotted. * Leaking of bid information, which requires a relationship of some degree between the project and a bidder as the bidder is handed information to gain an unfair advantage. * Bid Manipulation is another method for officials to choose the bidder of their choice but occurs after receipt of bids. The methods for this would include either changing bid parameters, evaluation processes, or other activity to effectively select the bidder of choice. * Rigged Specifications allow more bidder exclusion by officials by either tailoring requests to individual bidders or creating a vague criterion to reasonably choose a preferred bidder. * Unbalanced bidding involves high bid prices for commencing phases of development and low prices for later stages. This effectively increases the flow of funds for the bidding firm. This occurs when bidders cite high prices for items, intending to raise the number of units and purchase them at a competitive rate while simultaneously skimming profits from the artificially high bid price. Additionally, bidders may give low quotes for non-necessary items (knowledge gained through collusion or experience) to disadvantage other firms as their bid amount is more competitive. This also serves to increase the cost of entry for new firms. * Unjustified Sole Source Awards are bids chosen on criterion unrelated to their competitiveness. This can be performed either blatantly, by falsifying bids, or by price splitting. = Bid rigging within a cartel = * Bid suppression occurs when some of the conspirators agree not to submit bids allowing another conspirator to win the contract. * Complementary bidding, also known as cover bidding or courtesy bidding, occurs when some of the bidders agree to submit bids that are intended to be unsuccessful, so that another conspirator can win the contract. For example, the cover bids might contain prices that are uncompetitive in relation to the prices submitted by the conspirator who is designated to win the contract, or alternatively, the cover bids might contain conditions that the conspirators know will be unacceptable to the agency calling for the bids. * Bid rotation occurs when bidders take turns being the designated successful bidder. For example, each conspirator is designated to be the successful bidder on a certain contract, with conspirators designated to win other contracts. This is a form of market allocation, wherein the conspirators allocate or apportion markets, products, customers or geographic territories among themselves. This is then divvied up such that each will get a \\"fair share\\" of the total business, without having to truly compete with the others for that business. * Bid delegation can be a factor fostering the presence of bid rigging (for instance, it is the case of marketing agencies that bid for the same ad space on behalf of different and competing agents.). = Bid rigging as an auctioneer or official = * Phantom Bids are false bids taken by an auctioneer to trick a legitimate bidder into bidding more than they would have bid otherwise. The auctioneer hires confederates to call out the phantom bids. If the phantom bid is the winner, either the lot is hidden and comes back around for a second auction, or the second-highest legitimate bidder is informed that the first bidder was unable to make payment. * Buy-Back is the strategy whereby the auctioneer or seller bids on a lot and buys it back to protect it from being sold to the highest bidder for an insufficient price. This is fraud if the auction is advertised as an \\"absolute auction\\", meaning there are no reserve bids. * In the real estate industry, phantom auctions may occur when the bank will 'tentatively' auction a foreclosed home, and give bidders an option to give \\"preliminary bids\\" for homes that are not yet authorized for auction. If the reserve bids are not met, the home will be updated as \\"never was available for auction\\" even though bids were received. Some houses will be auctioned at fire-sale prices and the auctions will be closed before the auction was formally announced. Investors rush to get in their preliminary bids before the house is technically up for auction. Bidders fear losing options so it results in more bids, and naturally, higher prices. If bidders fail to reach the target bids, then the item was never available for auction. Banks do this because if they unloaded all their toxic assets at once, the housing market would collapse, so foreclosed homes are dribbled out with phantom auctions. These forms of bid rigging are not mutually exclusive of one another, and two or more of these practices could occur at the same time. For example, if one member of the bidding ring is designated to win a particular contract, that bidder's conspirators could avoid winning either by not bidding (\\"bid suppression\\"), or by submitting a high bid (\\"cover bidding\\").  Economic Costs  Many of the issues presented by bid rigging are the result of cartel involvement. Inefficient firms are not pushed out as they would in a competitive market, and firms experience more profit despite an inefficient allocation of resources. Cartels behave more like monopolies and as such their behaviors, such as bid rigging, create market inefficiencies as contracts are fulfilled at elevated values. Furthermore, bid prices increase with more repeated collusion. Ultimately this cost is typically borne by the taxpayer as government sponsored contracts are artificially above market value. Additionally, this can be thought of as raising prices for the taxpayer (or consumer) as firms rent seek. One study found that bid rigging significantly raised prices over market value in the seafood industry in Philadelphia in a bidding scheme involving Defense Personnel Support Center, a purchaser for the Department of Defense. The high price of entry and fewer entrants in many industries results in lessened incentives for firms to behave competitively. Remediation Bid rigging is an illegal practice under the criminal or competition laws of most developed countries. Depending on the jurisdiction, it is punishable by fines, imprisonment or both. At a very basic level there would likely be more competitive bidding if there were more firms present in a market, outside of a cartel, as evidence shows that bids lessen in value as the number of firms rises. Furthermore, collusion becomes less frequent with better market competitiveness, a result of reduced ability to compromise. The OECD's suggestions for better tenders include: * Developing expertise and awareness of the market for which a tender is being designed. * Maximize the number of bids and potential contractors for enhanced competition among proposals. * Strive for clarity in requirements and details. * Reduce potential for communication between bidders and procurement officials and adhere to a strict criterion and process of evaluation. Suggestions for ameliorating procurement auctions have also been put forth. Lengstein and Wolfstetter suggest that when a particular bidder is preferred, disregarding cost, possible reforms include a sealed Vickrey auction or if there is reason to believe that officials and bidders are in contact, an open auction is preferred to sidestep potential bribery. When officials are engaged in more competitive procurement processes with regard to price but are suspected of kickbacks, a potential solution would be the open auction preventing clandestine arrangements such as change order abuse. If a closed or sealed auction process is preferred, then the use of electronic bidding and investment in tamper-resistant systems is suggested.  Bid Rigging by Region  = South America =  Brazil  Brazil's Operation Car Wash is an ongoing investigation into the Brazilian semi-public multinational Petrobras. Petrobras is suspected of having overcharged bids as much as 3% of the total cost on contracts with an alleged $2.1 billion being misappropriated in kickbacks. Operation Car Wash is part of a larger investigation into Brazil's government as well and has contributed to the conviction and imprisonment of former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. In early January 2018, Petrobras settled a United States class action case for $2.95 billion, though JP Morgan and BTG Pactual had expected a settlement between $5 and $10 billion. The Petrobras scandal extends beyond bid rigging in the oil sector as the investigation has also implicated Brazilian construction firms as bid rigging was discovered to be rampant in the preparations for the 2016 Summer Olympics. This would not be the first instance of bid rigging by construction firms in recent Brazilian history as Andrade Gutierrez Engenharia SA, the nation's second largest construction firm, admitted to bid rigging during contract procurement for stadiums to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. This revelation implicates an additional five domestic construction firms and was revealed by the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econ√¥mica(CADE).  Colombia  From 2002 until 2013, the Colombian government opened 121 investigations into bid rigging, which lead to sixty-nine entities paying fines amounting to nearly $23.5 million, with an additional nine entities receiving sanctions. Colombia was found to generally comply with the OECD's recommendations regarding competitive procurement. = North America =  United States  In the United States, bid rigging is a federal felony criminal offense under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Even so, bid rigging is still rampant in the construction industry, auto sale auctions, and foreclosed home auctions.  Canada  In Canada, {bid rigging} ~~it~~ is an indictable criminal offence under Section 47 of the Competition Act. = Europe = Bid rigging is illegal in the European Union (EU) under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The annual cost to the EU in economic waste as a direct result of bid rigging among cartels was estimated to be between ‚Ç¨13 billion and ‚Ç¨37 billion in 2008. Bid rigging seems to be on the rise across Europe, raising concerns particularly over excessive expenditures and single- bid tenders. These single-bid tenders represented 17% of tenders in 2006, but 30% nine years later. RAND estimated that the overall annual cost posed to the EU by bid cost increases was $5 billion.  Slovakia  Bid rigging is illegal in Slovakia under the Act on the Protection of Competition and by EU membership, also Article 101 of TFEU. The first charges to be brought to court in Slovakia in 2006 by the Antimonopoly Office involved six construction companies who submitted bids with suspiciously consistent unit quotes. The fines from this bid rigging scheme amounted to ‚Ç¨45 million following an initial court decision, an over-ruling, and a reinstatement of the initial verdict. In 2007, a Slovakian government ministry participated in bidder exclusion by posting a request for proposals regarding consulting on a bulletin board in an official building, though not open to the public. This resulted in a consulting firm winning a ‚Ç¨120 million contract. The word for receiving kickbacks after participating in bid rigging is known as \\"tunelovanie\\" in Slovak.  Switzerland  Bid rigging occurs frequently in the construction industry in Switzerland. In 2007, seventeen different firms were involved in a bid rigging scheme but there was no prosecution as the ring had disbanded before colluding. In 2009, a ring of seven electricity firms from Bern were charged with bid rigging and fined two million Swiss francs. In Aargau, in 2011, a bid rigging scheme was discovered wherein seventeen firms were fined eight million Swiss francs though the appeals are ongoing. Multiple other cases are still ongoing.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, individuals can be prosecuted criminally under the Enterprise Act 2002. = Asia = Japan Although both a violation of Japanese criminal law and the Japan Anti-Monopoly Law, bid rigging is still a habitual practice of the Japanese construction industry. It has been shown by a number of academic studies both in Japan and in the US to be a system which considerably inflates the cost of construction projects, and in the Japanese public sector, considerably wasteful of annual tax money amounting to billions of Japanese yen. Dango refers to collusion in Japanese, or more precisely, \\"conference\\", and is an extremely prevalent system in Japan. Dango can be understood as a mutually beneficial system of bureaucracy and government and the private construction industry wherein bid rigging is incredibly common, benefiting colluding firms and officials alike in the form of kickbacks. The system of dango is often supported though as allowing small firms to continue to compete, though detractors are quick to point to the economic inefficiencies presented by a non-competitive market. The US Government, specifically the United States Trade Representative Office and Department of Commerce, made fierce efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s to urge the Japanese government to reform dango as a de facto non-tariff barrier to foreign firms in the Japanese construction market. Despite years of negotiations, including promises by the Japanese government in the Structural Impediment Initiative (SII) trade talks, the practice was never fully stamped out and continued to flourish. In 2006, Tadahiro Ando, the then governor of Miyazaki Prefecture, resigned over a series of bid rigging allegations and was subsequently sentenced to over three years in jail. As of 2008, thirteen lawsuits were still pending over 1990s' bid rigging for local government contracts to supply incinerator plants.  Korea  In a three and half year period from 1995 to 1998 there was an estimated $4.13 billion surcharge attributed to bid rigging in Korea's construction industry, representing 15.5% of the total spent. It was also found that firms already present in an area enjoyed a significant degree of incumbency, meaning that they were more likely to continue to win additional contracts in areas they were already developing. This was discovered to be a result of complementary bidding. Some legal action has been undertaken against these bid rigging schemes with nine contracting companies and several officials being charged and fined $5 billion in 1999.

He is the identical twin brother of former Major League Baseball player Jos√© Canseco. He was manager for the Brownsville Charros of the United League before the league's dissolution. He was previously the pitching and hitting coach for the Yuma Scorpions of the independent North American League and the manager of the Edinburg Roadrunners.  Playing career  Ozzie had a brief major league career, playing in 24 career games with the Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals between and 1993. In 1991, he played in Japan for the Kintetsu Buffaloes. Canseco was drafted as a pitcher by the New York Yankees in the second round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft. In stark contrast to the prolific, power hitting career of his twin brother, Ozzie never hit a major league home run. Canseco currently holds the Atlantic League single season home run record with 48, which he achieved while playing for the Newark Bears in 2000. (This was more home runs than his brother ever hit in a season.) After the season ended Canseco was named the league's MVP. Later he played one season in the Northern League. In 1991 Canseco signed a one-year contract with the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Japanese Pacific League.  Yuma Scorpions  On April 11, 2011, it was announced that Ozzie and his brother would play for the Yuma Scorpions of the North American League. In addition to playing, Ozzie would be the bench coach and Jose would manage the team. Ozzie played 12 games with 8 hits and 12 RBIs. His season batting average was .258.  Other activities  Canseco appeared on an episode of VH1's The Surreal Life (Season 5) as a Jos√© Canseco impersonator. At the end of the program, it was revealed that he was Jos√©'s twin brother. He has also reportedly appeared at baseball card shows and book signings passing himself off as his brother. As manager of the Brownsville Charros in the United League, Ozzie pulled his team off the field with a 2‚Äì1 lead giving the RGV Whitewings a win.http://www.valleymorningstar.com/premium/article_8ba31b08-032e-11e4-9802-0017a43b2370.html?TNNoMobile  Legal troubles  In 2002, Canseco pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a nightclub fight on October 31, 2001. He and his brother got into a fight with two California tourists at a Miami Beach nightclub that left one man with a broken nose and another needing 20 stitches in his lip; Canseco was charged with two counts of aggravated battery. The brothers received probation and community service ‚Äì Ozzie was sentenced to 18 months' probation, 200 hours of community service and anger management classes. In 2003, Canseco was sentenced to four months in jail for possessing an illegal anabolic steroid and driving with a suspended license. Police stopped Canseco on May 1, 2003, because the tinted windows on his Lincoln Navigator were too dark. The steroid Nandrolone and a syringe were found in the SUV during a search.

The series debuted worldwide in 1996. games consist mainly of racing with various cars on various, and to some extent, including stunts in races. Since L.A. Rush the series has adopted its street racing atmosphere. Rush series =San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing= The original San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing was released in 1996 in the arcades and included 3 tracks and 8 cars. San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing (home version) The original arcade version was followed by the home version for the Nintendo 64 in 1997. This included 3 additional cars (bringing the total to 11) and four additional tracks (bringing the total to 7; 1 of these tracks was hidden). The game also included new shortcuts that were not in the arcade's original three tracks. Within the game's 6th track is a hidden stunt track. Several months after the game's release, there were rumors about a bonus \\"Alcatraz Track\\" hidden within the game. Via a special code, or through such hardware like Gameshark, an unfinished version of the Alcatraz track could be unlocked within the game. The developers of the game later revealed, via interviews with IGN, that the track was originally to be included in the final release, but was cancelled by the publisher due to the cartridge running out of space to hold the finalized track. Instead, the developers decided to hide the track within the game, rather than completely delete it. The version plays like a beta, with many textures unfinished on the track and lacks many shortcuts. The finalized version of the track was eventually released in \\"San Francisco Rush The Rock: Alcatraz Edition\\" in arcades and Rush 2 for the Nintendo 64. San Francisco Rush The Rock: Alcatraz Edition Also released in 1997, San Francisco Rush The Rock: Alcatraz Edition included the 4 new tracks from the home version and added additional shortcuts to them all. 4 new cars were also added which are also included in the next Rush game. =Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA= Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA was released in 1998 on the Nintendo 64. This is the first game in the series that does not include the core three tracks from the original San Francisco Rush, and the first, and only, that includes multiple cities to race in. It is also the first Rush game to have a proper stunt track (rather than the hidden stunt track in the Nintendo 64 version of San Francisco Rush). Like the last home game, new cars are unlocked by collecting keys but now Mountain Dew cans are also featured. Rush 2 includes every car that was used in its predecessors and includes several more (both hidden and default) that are new to Rush. =San Francisco Rush 2049= San Francisco Rush 2049 was released in arcades in 1999. It features 4 all-new tracks as well as a returning track, Alcatraz, re-invented for the future. Unlike Rush 2, Rush 2049 does not carry over cars from the previous game. Except for two returning cars, all cars in this game are new. Also new is Rush 2049 uses coins, which replace keys when unlocking new cars. Two rarer versions of Rush 2049 exist: SF Rush 2049 TE and SF Rush 2049 SE, which stand for \\"Tournament Edition\\" and \\"Special Edition\\", respectively. These games featured 2 additional tracks and a number of additional cars, as well as bug fixes (mostly to eliminate certain dubious racing practices). The SE version was produced by Betson Enterprises and released in 2003. San Francisco Rush 2049 (home version) The home version of San Francisco Rush 2049 was released in 1999 for the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 with major changes. The Alcatraz track from the arcade version was removed to make way for improvements of stunt mode. New modes introduced are multiplayer battle mode and special obstacle course. The game includes the 2 race tracks from \\"Tournament Edition\\", 4 stunt arenas, and 8 battle venues. A new feature for cars is the wings, a trademark feature that gives the player axial control over their car and a slightly more gradual descent while airborne. The Dreamcast version of the game was also included in the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 collection for the Playstation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube. =L.A. Rush= L.A.

The series is the retelling of the \\"Naraudh Lar-Chan√´\\", the Riddle of the Treesong, set in the fictional world of Edil-Amarandh. The story mainly revolves about the character of adolescent girl Maerad, who was forced into slavery along with her mother as a child, after the sacking of the Bard school of Pellinor. Books So far the books have been published by Penguin Books in Australia, Walker Books in the UK, Candlewick Press in the US (except The Bone Queen published by Walker Books), and Bastei-L√ºbbe in Germany, with the translation done by Michael Krug. =The Bone Queen= A prequel, published in 2016. The promising young Bard Cadvan summons a revenant, the Bone Queen, which causes him to be exiled. Cadvan and his friend Dernhil the poet must then track down and vanquish the Bone Queen. =The Friendship (short story)= A prequel story of how Cadvan and the healer Bard Saliman became friends. =The Gift (also: The Naming)= First published in Australia in 2003, the United Kingdom in 2004, and as \\"The Naming\\", in the United States during 2005. The Gift begins with Maerad, in \\"Gilman's Cot\\" as a slave, where she has been for most of her life, with few memories of her former life, her mother having died several years before. She is discovered by Cadvan, one of the great mystics known as Bards, who reveals to her that she too has \\"the Gift\\" shared by all of these, by which she is able to command nature to do her will. Cadvan soon discovers that her mother was Milana of Pellinor, the leader of the First Circle of the sacked School of Pellinor, of whom it was previously assumed that there were no survivors. Knowing this, Cadvan decides to help her escape, believing that it might not be random chance that he came upon the only known survivor from Pellinor. Cadvan finds that Maerad's Gift is unusually powerful for one never formally taught; he begins to suspect of her more significance than he had before. Cadvan takes her to the School of Innail, to make the presence of a survivor from Pellinor known and to establish Maerad a Minor Bard of Pellinor. During their time there, Maerad obtains a long-forgotten prophecy concerning the Foretold One who will defeat the Nameless One. This Nameless One is a corrupt political leader, formerly called Sharma, who discarded his own truename in order to become immortal. Twice has he attempted to conquer the land of Edil-Amarandh, and he has twice been vanquished. His last bid for power is the one in which the Foretold One, Elednor, Edil - Amarandh naor Fire Lily of Edil - Amarandh, will defeat him, leaving him dead or helpless forever. Maerad's own history, being coincident with that of the Foretold One, implies that she is Elednor, although Maerad does not immediately embrace the idea. After their brief but enjoyed stay at Innail, Cadvan takes Maerad across the country of Annar to the city of Norloch, intending to have her instated as a full Bard and given her Name, and also to see his old teacher Nelac. En route, they discover that the Nameless One's corrupt Bards, the Hulls, are roaming freely, so that non-users of magic are terrified and terrorized; that Maerad is descended on her mother Milana's side from Lady Ardina, a faerie creature, an Elidhu, who still lives in the forest as monarch of a Lothl√≥rien-like settlement, Rachida; and that Maerad has a younger brother, called Hem or Cai, who, like her, is an inheritor of the Gift. Ardina happens to be known by many names: The Elidhu, Queen of Rachida, The Moonchild, Daughter of the Moon. When Maerad and Cadvan, who has become her tutor, reach Norloch, they discover that corruption has penetrated even here, in that the First Bard of all Annar, Enkir, has fallen under Sharma's influence. He is revealed as the one who had Pellinor destroyed and who sold Maerad into slavery. Largely as a result of this, though also because of his own misogyny, this Bard refuses to admit that Maerad is the Foretold One, or even to let her be instated as a Bard. Therefore, Cadvan and Nelac invoke an archaic ritual called the Way of the White Flame, by which Maerad is initiated as a full Bard. Her Name, at this point, is revealed to be that of the Foretold One; Elednor, which means \\"Fire Lily\\". Driven out by their enemy's hostility, Cadvan and Maerad flee. Maerad's brother is sent to another place for safety. =The Riddle= The Riddle begins where The Gift left off, with the main characters fleeing Norloch. It was first published in Australia in 2004, in the United Kingdom in 2005, and in the US in August 2006. The Riddle sees Maerad and Cadvan continue the search for Maerad's destiny, which takes them to the lively island School of Busk, which is a Hellenistic community; north to the realms of the Pilanel, who are Maerad's kin through her father Dorn; and finally to the very heart of the realm of the Winterking, Arkan, another Elidhu, who is a glacial spirit allied with the Nameless One. Hem/Cai (Maerad's brother) has fled south along with Saliman. As in Innail, Maerad settles in Busk and feels very much at home ‚Äì more so than previously, perhaps because she is no longer accustomed to expect bullying ‚Äì while Cadvan continues the search for the mysterious \\"Treesong\\", with the help of Nerili, First Bard of the School of Busk, the key to Maerad's destiny. Maerad also begins to explore her powers and their full potential, producing some humorous outcomes. Their peace is shattered by dark events at the annual \\"Rite of Renewal\\" and the news that they have been named traitors to the White Flame after the shocking revelations of The Gift, which causes them once again to flee. Their journey is constantly blighted by setbacks, and by the constant threat from both Arkan and other Bards. Maerad also begins to fear the \\"darkness\\" within her own heart, as she begins to wonder about herself, her powers, and her place in Edil-Amarandh's destiny. This fear resolves itself into a constant tension between herself and her mentor, Cadvan, and leads Maerad into an almost unforgivable act that may threaten their relationship and Maerad's wellbeing forever. =The Crow= Published in Australia May 2006, in the UK July 2006, and in the US in 2007. The Crow follows the journey of Maerad's brother, Hem, as he begins his training as a Bard in the southern School of Turbansk, where he was taken by the Bard Saliman. The events in this book occur during the same time as the events of \\"The Riddle\\". Hem has difficulties fitting in this strange land; he does not know the local language and finds it hard to make friends after being a loner for many years. All the while the Nameless One is building his armies to the east; thus, the threat of war is growing. In this climate, Hem makes his first friend in the form of a girl, Zelika from the eastern school of Baladh, and begins to discover his own unique talents and his place in the \\"Treesong\\". He travels through places which most haven't been through, like the underground city of Nal-Ak-Burat and the Nameless One's stronghold, Dagra in the constant companionship of a white crow, Irc, whom he rescues in the beginning of the book. He meets the Elidhu, Nyanar from whom Hem will learn one half of the Treesong, to be combined with the half Maerad learns from the Winterking. =The Singing= Published in Australia June 2008, in the UK on 1 September, and in the US on 10 March 2009. > In a desperate race against the dark, Maerad must try to solve the final > riddle of the treesong.

Characters *Bard - a human who is born having the ability known as the 'Gift' in Annar and the Seven Kingdoms or the 'Voice' among the Pilani of the Howes of Murask and Tlon, by which one is able to command nature. Command of nature is wielded by use of the magical language known as the Speech, which all life-forms understand and which any human may learn as a means of communication (as in the region of the Suderain, where it is used by politicians in discussion), though only those born with the Gift can use its words as a means of supermundane power. Although use of the Voice is inherent and usually appears at some point in a child's life, one born with it must learn and develop it as if it were a skill. Individual Bards have differing strengths of power, which determine the limits of their command. All Bards live according to a code of honor known as the Balance and belong to a faction known as the Light, which is sometimes mythologized as a deity. Because Bards are thoroughly schooled to the ideas of the Balance, they are often perplexed by greed and selfishness. All Bards are given an education in the three disciplines of Reading, Tending, and Making, which make up the Bardic way of life. Different Bards adhere to different aspects of these three arts, which overlap and are therefore versatile. Each Bard has a particular speciality within the arts that is central to its life; specialities including both mundane activity and psi phenomena. The word \\"Bard\\" refers to a talent and liking for music which all Bards share. Frequently, they are poets, whose poetry reflects beauty and mortality. Most esteemed among the Bardic paradigms is the 'Way of the Heart', which consists of compassion, strong interpersonal bonds, and love. In the diverse societies of Edil-Amarandh, Bards perform roles variously resembling those of musicians, artists, scholars, priestkings, healers, caretakers, protectors, political advisors (in which role they have great influence), mystics, and shamans. All human mystics who appear in the story are Gifted, though not all are considered Bards, given that some of them may not have received training in the Three Arts or schooling in the ethics of the Balance. Both training and potency of inherent Gift determine the extent of a Bard's ability. Bards age slower than regular people do, starting when they turn 20 years of age, and have three times the lifespan of other people. *Elidhu - Faerie-like creatures who predate humanity in Edil-Amarandh, they are called Elementals by the Bards. The Elidhu have enormous power and can breed with mortals if they so choose. Known Elidhu/Bard hybrids are Maerad and Hem. The power of the hybrids is higher than the average of the two components: Maerad is stronger than the midpoint of the average Bard and the average Elidhu. The Elidhu generally have little interest in the goings on of the mortal world and are seen as neither good nor evil, with two notable exceptions. These are Arkan, the personnification of ice, who is often seen as evil (although Maerad is given reason to think otherwise in The Riddle); and Ardina, Maerad's ancestor, who is seen as good. The Elementals also have a variety of abilities uncommon to humans, though these, in turn, seem to vary among individual Elidhu. Ardina is shown having taken the form of a wolf (an ability inherited by Maerad), and sometimes appears as a \\"moonchild\\"; a celestial fairy able to hover upon the air, travel great distances within minutes, and heal wounds with a touch. Arkan is shown creating deceptive illusions, producing light from no apparent source, and commanding the weather. Landrost, spirit of the mountain, summons strange demonic life-forms called \\"wers\\" to his aid and can direct them by his will. Nyanar, a forest Elidhu appearing in The Crow, is able to change shape with ease and identifies himself with and as his environment. Bards, even those such as Cadvan and Saliman, often show a distrust of them - judging them as fey and amoral beings near-totally beyond human ken and concepts such as good and evil; a judgement that, with the notable exceptions of Ardina, Arkan, Nyanar, and the Landrost, is essentially accurate. *Maerad - an adolescent girl around sixteen years of age at the beginning of the series. She grew up with her mother, Milana, in Pellinor as young child before the sack of their home. Sold into slavery, Maerad lives her life from the age of seven to the start of the novel at sixteen in the confinements of Gilman's Cot. She is discovered by Cadvan, a powerful Bard of Lirigon who rescues her and tells her that she is a Bard, a person with the \\"Gift\\". Later, she is believed by Cadvan to be the Foretold One, known as the Fire Lily, who will save Edil-Amarandh from the Nameless One's most powerful attack; a belief supported by the fact that her true name is Elednor, which means \\"Fire Lily\\" in the Bards' magical Speech. As the books progress her relationship with Cadvan progresses and at the end of The Singing the two are a couple. *Cadvan - Cadvan of Lirigon is a travelling Bard who rescues Maerad from Gilman's Cot and has her initiated as a Minor, then full Bard. He appears to be around 35 years of age, but is likely to be around 70, because Bards live thrice as long as do other people. He is tall and slender, with black hair, dark blue eyes, and an aquiline nose. Cadvan is known to have disastrously handled evil magic in his youth; to have been a worker against the powers of Darkness ever since; and to have extensive knowledge. It is also revealed that he has a preference for coffee, which exists in the novels as \\"a drink from the Suderain\\" (probably a reference to the Middle-Eastern origins of coffee), a stronger liking for mushrooms, and the innate ability to provoke revelations of truth from other people, even if they are not aware of knowing it. This ability is called \\"Truthtelling\\" by the characters. *Sharma ‚Äì commonly known as the Nameless One, Sharma is the chieftain and would-be sorcerer who eschews his own true Name in order to become immortal. He is a lord of Darkness, the evil force that threatens Edil-Amarandh, and is obeyed by several other evil beings, among them the mountain spirit Landrost and the Winterking Arkan, although Maerad has reason to believe differently of Arkan in particular. According to the prophecy, Sharma will attempt thrice to conquer the world, only to be vanquished during the third attack, which is the setting of the story. His domain is D√©n Raven, a southern monarchy described as \\"little more than a huge prison\\". *Saliman ‚Äì Bard of the Circle of Turbansk, one of the realms nearest that of the Nameless One. Because of his dark skin, he is seen with some racism by Bards less wise than himself. Saliman is a friend of Cadvan's and later harbours Hem. *Enkir ‚Äì First Bard of Norloch, capital city of the domain called Annar. Enkir is a rigid, self- opinionated figure whose arrogance and bigotry appear to have increased immensely since his rise to power. He ultimately betrays Annar by siding with Sharma and implementing the latter's agenda in Annar, while giving to more gullible Bards that the harsh security measures imposed by himself are imposed for the benefit of the Light. It is he who had sold Milana and Maerad into slavery, and he who later supplies Sharma's agents with weapons. *Nelac ‚Äì Cadvan's aged and trusted tutor. He harbours Cadvan and Maerad during their time in Norloch and later helps initiate Maerad as full Bard. Nelac is imprisoned by Enkir on a charge of rebellion, almost certainly because of his role in Maerad's escape from Enkir. *Hem/Cai - Maerad's younger brother. He goes to Turbansk with Saliman after being found by Maerad on her travels with Cadvan in the first book. Unlike Maerad, who resembles their mother's ethnic background, Hem resembles their father and is thought to have closer ancestral ties with the latter's relations. In the third book, Hem infiltrates one of Sharma's military camps and ultimately Sharma's capital, Dagra, itself. There, with the help of the book's titular character, the crow called Irc, Hem acquires half of the Treesong. The presence of Irc causes Hem to be dubbed \\"White Crow\\" (Lios Hlaf in Turbansk's native language) when they have become famous for helping Turbansk resist Sharma's armies. *Milana - The First Bard of the Circle of Pellinor, mother of Maerad and Hem. She died in Gilman's Cot, her power and will to live having been broken by Enkir of Norloch. *Dorn √† Triberi - husband of Milana and father of Maerad and Hem. Little is known about Dorn, save that he is a member of the Pilanel people born with the Bardic Gift, who traveled south to Annar for his training. Dorn was killed during the sack of Pellinor. He is survived by his children; by Sirkana, the more intimate (with him) of his two sisters; and (until the second book) by his nephew Dharin, who accompanies Maerad to consult with the Pilanel's northern neighbors. *Irc - A white crow rescued by Hem from being killed by his flock. His name is said to be a synonym of \\"bird\\" derived from Hem's ancestral language, Pilani. Irc is an insouciant, spunky, clever, self- important character who acts as Hem's companion, comforter, and messenger. Unlike an albino, he has golden eyes and a black beak. When Turbansk is attacked by the mutant \\"deathcrows\\" sent from Sharma's realm of D√©n Raven, Hem is inspired by a dream to invoke the help of native birds; at his request, the entire bird population of Turbansk attack and destroy the deathcrows. Irc, throughout this operation, acts as a messenger between Hem and the pelican called Ara-kin, who is commander of the birds. Irc later accompanies Hem to the underground city of Nak-Al-Burat; to the espionage missions on the borders of D√©n Raven; and finally into D√©n Raven itself. There, Irc observes a quarrel between Sharma and his second-in-command Imank and steals a tuning fork that contains half of the Treesong. Irc thereafter rejoins Hem and travels with him out of D√©n Raven. During the story, Irc is shown to have an instinctive sensitivity to imminent danger and to be capable of counting up to five, but not above. He resents being made undignified and enjoys theft, argument, and mischief. *Ceredin ‚Äì Cadvan's former sweetheart and loyal friend. Ceredin was killed during Cadvan's handling of evil magic, whereinafter her death proved the catalyst for his refusal to handle it again. *Dernhil ‚Äì A Bard originally trained at the coastal School of Gent, who is first seen at Innail as a librarian. He teaches Maerad how to read and write during her time at Innail. Maerad, being beautiful, unintentionally causes Dernhil fall in love with and court her; but because Maerad is hostile to courtship as a result of being exposed to and almost becoming a victim of rape, she refuses him and actually punches him in panic. Dernhil forgives her and composes a poem to apologise. Later, he is interrogated by two of the Nameless One's corrupt Bards, the Hulls, who are searching for the then-departed Cadvan and Maerad. Dernhil then kills himself in order to protect them. *Ardina ‚Äì A fabled Elidhu - once called the Jewel of Lirion - and ancient enemy of Arkan the Winterking. Ardina is renowned in human legend for her strong stance against evil alongside the human Ardhor, through whom she is the ancestor of the family called the House of Karn, whereof Maerad and Hem are members. Ardina herself lives a strange, multiple life, wherein she is sometimes a playful, fey,in the forest, sometimes a wise, solemn woodland queen, and sometimes a \\"Moonchild\\" (a figure that seems to be composed partly of moonlight); wherein she might give forth useful discourse or sings such songs as describe the different and often contradictory facets of her character. The fact that she has multiple personalities is revealed only to Maerad (and thereby to the reader), because Cadvan would not \\"brook contradiction\\". She acts as a haphazard guide and savior to Maerad and Cadvan at certain points. *Arkan ‚Äì Called the Ice Witch, the Winterking, and the Ice King, Arkan is an Elidhu who appears as a humanlike figure taller than a man. His power, and indeed his essence, is in the ice, the snow, the winds, and the mountain where he lives. He is a prominent, albeit ambiguous figure in the legends of Edil-Amarandh; often he is a villain, or a personification of Ice Ages. In either role, he is sometimes an ally of the Nameless One. Arkan is often considered Ardina's rival, though he is shown saying that they are not enemies. His views of life are very different from those of humans, whom he holds in some contempt. In The Riddle, he has Maerad captured and holds her in his palace, surrounding her with illusions of a luxurious interior which are only dispelled when she plays her lyre. Here, the relationship between them begins to develop along the lines of a slightly romanticized version of the Hades and Persephone story. Because of their contradictory purposes, Maerad escapes him. In one of the earlier chapters of The Singing, Arkan is shown contacting Maerad by telepathy, scoffing at her fear of the creatures Sharma has sent against her. By this time, it is evident that Arkan is no longer Sharma's ally. It is he who reveals the Treesong to Maerad, and a suggestion exists that he did so moved by his own attraction to her. *Dharin √° Lobvar - Maerad's cousin, the son of one of her father's two sisters. Dharin is a cheerful, confident young man who has long been a trader among the Pilanel and their neighbors. At the behest of their mutual aunt, Sirkana √° Triberi, Dharin accompanies Maerad on a journey northward to consult for advice the Inuit-like people who dwell in the farthest north. Their means of transport is a dogsled whose dogs are loyal to Dharin. During their return from the people whom they have consulted, Dharin is killed by the barbarian tribe known as the Jussacks, and Maerad taken prisoner. His death is said to have been foreseen by Sirkana, who is a Bard, with no formal training, only the \\"Voice\\" and the \\"Sight\\",which is the special power of foresight. It is very rare, even among Bards. Lanorgil of Pellinor, one of Maerad's ancestors was a prominent Seer. *Hull - A corrupt Bard. Unlike Bards, who try to maintain the 'Balance', Hulls seek only power and often work for whoever can get them the most power. Currently they work for Sharma, the Nameless One. Hulls have all the skills of Bards, but none of the moral inhibitions. They use their perverted gifts to create monsters to aid them in their quest of destruction and devastation. Whereas Bards are unusually long- lived but can be killed like other humans, Hulls are nearly immortal and can only be destroyed by Bardic skills, which requires enormous effort and strength. Maerad of Pellinor has single-handedly defeated several of the strongest Hulls at once, leading to speculation over the depth of her powers. The average Hull appears to the heightened senses of Bards as an undead-like creature having leathery yellow skin, red eyes, and no hair, although they are able to disguise themselves as humans to deceive the eyes of ordinary people. A remark by Cadvan suggests that a Hull can be restored to humanity; but no instances of this are shown. *Nerili ‚Äì Fondly called Neri, Nerili is the First Bard of Busk (a School located on the Isle of Thorold) and is a stern, commanding, compassionate figure, confident in her authority, and wise in the Bardic \\"Way of the Heart\\", a system of beliefs to which Bards adhere. She is magically the strongest Bard of her School and lives (by her culture's standards) an austere life. It is suggested twice or thrice that she and Cadvan have had a sexual affair, according to the premise that flexible sexual lives are permitted among Bards. She shares with Cadvan the ability to compel truth from her partners in conversation. Her grandfather is Ankil, who lives as a goatherd in Busk's internal mountains. Ankil does not have any formal training unlike his brother Elenxi, who is among the First Circle of the School of Busk. *Cur/Snout ‚Äì Children captured by Sharma's army and gradually brainwashed into serving it by a combination of drugs and psychological conditioning. Because the Bardic ethos considers child soldiery an abomination, the presence of the Curs weakens the defences of the cities they are sent to invade. This impact is enhanced by the ruthlessness of the snouts, who are trained to be merciless or even sadistic, and sometimes by the presence among the snouts of a defender's own child or relative. Snouts are introduced in the third book, wherein Hem infiltrates their training camp in search of his friend Zelika (see below) and accompanies a troop of Curs to D√©n Raven. *Dogsoldier ‚Äì A category of infantry serving Sharma and his Hulls, dogsoldiers are described as cyborg-like constructs consisting of humans to which mechanical appendages have been attached. The name is derived from the double-pronged metal \\"snout\\" that projects from each dogsoldier's head; this being one of their chief weapons. All of a dogsoldier's weapons are built onto its body and consist largely of a \\"liquid fire\\" of undisclosed composition that is sprayed, often from the snout, onto victims. Dogsoldiers are unvaryingly loyal to their commanders and show no mercy to those whom they are sent to kill. *Imank ‚Äì Sharma's second in command who is called, several times over the course of the story, a sorcerer. Imank is a Hull who commands the \\"Black Army\\" of D√©n Raven when it makes invasions into the region surrounding Turbansk. He is said to have held control of D√©n Raven during Sharma's long absence, and to be the most direct threat to the neighboring kingdoms. Perhaps as a result of having been ruler in Sharma's absence, Imank is rebellious against Sharma and resists him throughout the third book. Their final quarrel begins when they contest questions relating to the management of their resources, and leads to fighting between the factions loyal to Imank and those loyal to Sharma. Ultimately, Sharma confronts Imank, who attempts to kill him. At this, Sharma summons the monstrous 'Shika', a race of \\"uncreatures\\" that Sharma can imperfectly control. Imank's fate is not revealed; but because Sharma cannot be killed even by another magic-user, Imank is presumed dead. *Zelika ‚Äì Daughter of a noble house called Il Aran, which lived in Baladh (a School adjacent to The School of Turbansk) before it was annexed and sacked by Sharma's forces. Having survived the slaughter of her family, Zelika traveled to Turbansk alone, intending to die there fighting against the invading army. In Turbansk, she literally ran into Hem, who took her to Saliman, with whom he was living. Zelika became Hem's friend and teacher of the local language, Suderaini. She accompanied Hem on several of his adventures and later joined him and Saliman when they fled from Turbansk immediately prior to its destruction. By this time, her obsession with revenge for the decimation of her family had been reduced, so that she no longer desired to die and was more amenable to suggestion. During their stay in the underground city of Nal-Ak- Burat, Zelika was, in partnership with Hem, trained as a spy for the Light. Their only mission ended in near-disaster when Zelika saw her brother among the child soldiers of the Dark's army and was captured trying to take him from them. She was later killed, although Hem did not know this and risked his own life trying to find and rescue her. After her death, Saliman followed the children's trail to the site thereof and buried her. Hem, upon visiting her grave, stated that he had desired to marry her \\"when [they] grew up\\". *Nyanar ‚Äì An Elidhu, said to be more typical of his species than are Arkan or Ardina. It is suggested that he was worshipped as a god by the people of Nal-Ak-Burat, in which he appears as a painting. Several times, Nyanar is shown contacting Hem, variously in the form of a \\"tree man\\" (a figure combining characteristics of a man and characteristics of a tree), of a humanoid spirit, and of a deer. In the last, he reveals the Treesong to Hem; in the former two, he had sheltered Hem in the places through which Hem travels by concealing him in the memory of those places as they were before they were despoiled by Sharma. Most of Nyanar's character is expressed through his speeches. References  External links  * Alison Croggon web site. * Alison Croggon's Official Forum .

Shanes Park is located 50 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History In 1960, the eastern portion of Shane's Park was purchased by the commonwealth government to house an air navigational facility. Substantial heritage from this facility remains to this day. As this required very little space, most areas of the site were retained as intact bushland, while other areas regenerated naturally. The 560 site known as 'Shane's Park' now comprises one of the largest remaining woodlands in the Cumberland Plain (western Sydney). Shane's Park woodland The Shane's Park woodland is possibly the most intact remnant of the vegetation which once covered western Sydney, and contains a wide range of vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered flora, fauna and ecological communities. The site is particularly renowned for its woodland bird fauna, including the speckled warbler. The site is not open to public access. The present owners, Air Services Australia (a Federal government entity), consider the site surplus to their needs, and propose to hand over ownership as a public reserve to the New South Wales government. The Deed of Agreement for transfer requires the NSW government to gazette the land as regional park. This requirement has caused conflict with some community organisations. The National Parks & Wildlife Act (s. 30 H) outlines the purpose of a regional park as being for recreation only, and does not expect management for wildlife conservation. If the deed is signed, it is likely that the site will be amalgamated into the adjoining (in-development) Wianamatta Regional Park. Opponents to regional park gazettal for Shane's Park have also opposed the plans for Wianamatta Regional Park, which provide for commercial recreational opportunities and the fencing and culling of native fauna populations for public safety.

Description The statue consists of five separate aluminum pieces buried in the ground, giving the impression of a distressed giant attempting to free himself from the ground. The left hand and right foot barely protrude, while the bent left leg and knee jut into the air. The high right arm and hand reach farther out of the ground. The bearded face, with the mouth in mid-scream, struggles to emerge from the earth.  History  The Awakening was created by J. Seward Johnson, Jr. in 1980 as part of Washington, DC's 11th annual Sculpture Conference, and the sculpture was originally installed at Hains Point in East Potomac Park, Washington, D.C.. Hains Point was designated by Congress as the site for a National Peace Garden in 1987. Although no work had started on the National Peace Garden for many years, the decision still prompted the eventual sale of the sculpture by its owner, The Sculpture Foundation. Real estate developer Milton Peterson purchased the sculpture for $750,000 in 2007 for installation at his new National Harbor development in Maryland. Crews removed The Awakening from Hains Point in February 2008 for its move to National Harbor. At the National Harbor development, the sculpture was installed on a specially built beach along the Potomac River.http://blog.washingtonpost.com/washbizblog/2008/02/moving_day_for_the_awakening.html The Awakening II Seward Johnson created a copy of The Awakening, which was unveiled in Chesterfield, Missouri on October 10, 2009. The sculpture is located adjacent to Chesterfield Central Park, near the intersection of Chesterfield Parkway and Park Circle Drive to the west of Chesterfield Mall. The installation of the sculpture in Chesterfield was commissioned by Chesterfield Arts, which is a non-profit arts organization supporting public art and the visual, performing and literary arts in Chesterfield and the West County. $1 million in funding was provided by Sachs Properties.http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/08/03/daily16.html Trivia The sculpture (while at Hains Point) is the centerpiece of a scene in the film Shadow Conspiracy, with the actors moving among the pieces. In the video game Primordia it has been the inspiration for the design of the buried- under-the-sands robot Goliath, which came out from a childhood experience of Mark Yohalem. In the Orson Scott Card book Empire, the statue is mentioned several times and is the first meeting point for two of the main characters. In an early scene in the 1995 film The Net, a cabinet member commits suicide on a park bench overlooking the sculpture.

It is located west-southwest of Newcastle's central business district in the City of Lake Macquarie North Ward. An irregularly shaped suburb, Cardiff is home to two government primary schools, a Catholic primary school and a government high school. Like most major suburbs in Lake Macquarie, it has its own commercial centre with a post office, pub (hotel), real estate agencies, take-away shops, a video store, two opportunity stores, numerous hairdressers and two supermarkets. History The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land. The first grant to a white settler in the Cardiff area was a parcel of to George Weller in 1833, stretching west of the current Macquarie Road to Argenton and Cockle Creek. Other selections were taken up by individual settlers from 1862 to the east of the Weller grant. The locality became known as Winding Creek after the stream which wound its way from south-east to north-west across the central valley of the area. In the latter part of the 19th century two factors attracted people to the Winding Creek area. One was coal mining, with the Lymington (1882) and South Wallsend (1884, later renamed Cardiff) collieries both starting production in the vicinity of the current Cardiff South. The other was the decision to construct the Sydney to Newcastle railway, which led to a navvies camp being established at Winding Creek in 1883, and work continuing through most of the rest of the decade. The line originally ran close to current Myall Rd, however the gradient from Cardiff up to Tickhole Tunnel proved too steep for the trains of the period, and the line was relocated to the present position a few years after it was opened. For a short period in the 1880s Lymington became the popular name for the whole Cardiff area, supplanting Winding Creek, however it fell foul of the postal authorities, because of its similarity to another, established locality name. There were a number of Welsh settlers living in the area, and on the suggestion of one of them, James Edwards, the name Cardiff was chosen after the capital of Wales. It was officially adopted in 1889. Education The suburb is home to two government primary schools, Cardiff Public School and Cardiff North Public School; a government secondary school, Cardiff High School; and a Catholic primary school, St. Kevin's Primary School. Cardiff High School, opened in late 1962, is a public secondary school located at 30 Boronia Street in Cardiff serving Cardiff, Cardiff South, Garden Suburb, Hillsborough, and Macquarie Hills areas.

The suburb is also home to a number of used car dealerships. Industrial Estate Cardiff is a major employment area thanks to the Cardiff Industrial Estate, which is the highest employing area in the Hunter region. Around half of that industrial estate is accessible only via one section of Munibung Road, a two- lane road between two T-intersections (Torrens Avenue and Mitchell Road) which experience frequent crashes. The intersection of Munibung Road with Macquarie Road and Myall Road is the main access point for the entire industrial estate and suffers from some of the most severe congestion in the Hunter Region. A proposal exists for the extension of Pennant Street over the railway line to a roundabout connecting to Main Road near Glendale Drive and to the end of Stockland Drive inside the Stockland Glendale shopping centre. The proposal also includes the construction of a new railway station for access to the industrial estate and the Glendale shopping centre. The proposal is ready to proceed but has been awaiting state government funding for several years. A further proposal exists for the extension of Munibung Road through the redeveloped former Pasminco Sulphide site, connecting through the new light industrial and residential development to T C Frith Avenue in Boolaroo. It is hoped that the developer will fund that road as part of that development. Railway Cardiff railway station The main northern railway line passes through Cardiff to the north of the industrial estate and commercial centre. Cardiff railway station is located on Main Road up a steep hill from the commercial centre. The railway station has a single island platform, which is located between the two tracks. Access to the platform is only available via a staircase that is exposed to the weather and difficult for elderly residents to negotiate. After two decades of petitioning by locals, funding from State Government was allocated to upgrade the railway station. The upgrade will include the installation of lifts and extending the existing platform to accommodate for eight-car trains. The upgrade of the train station commenced mid-2012 and it is expected to be completed by late 2013. Two carparks are provided on the southern side of the railway station. A small carpark is located directly alongside the southbound track, while a larger carpark is located down another steep staircase.

He was the eldest son of John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. Adams served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and on the Boston City Council. He died of an apparent suicide at age 28.  Biography  George Washington Adams was born in Berlin, the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia, on April 12, 1801. He was a member of the distinguished Adams family. Adams was the eldest son of John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States, who was then serving as a diplomatic representative of the United States, and his English- born wife Louisa Catherine Adams.Lewis L. Gould, American First Ladies: Their Lives and Their Legacy (2014), p. 47Ellis, Joseph J. First Family: John and Abigail Adams. New York: Random House, 2010: 217. He was named for the first president. His grandfather John Adams was the first vice president of the United States and also the second president. He was born a month after his grandfather left office. Adams's grandmother, Abigail Adams, was unhappy with the decision of her son to name the child after George Washington and not after her husband. She thought the decision \\"ill judged\\" and \\"wrong,\\" adding that John Adams also seemed offended.[This is an Early Access document from The Adams Papers. It is not an authoritative final version.] John Quincy Adams's second son John Adams II (1803‚Äì1834) was named after his grandfather. Adams graduated from Harvard University in the Class of 1821 and studied law. After briefly practicing as an attorney, he ran for state office. He was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1826 and served one year. In 1828, Adams served on the Boston City Council. He delivered an Independence Day speech, \\"An Oration delivered at Quincy, on the Fifth of July, 1824\\", which was later published as a pamphlet. Adams disappeared on April 30, 1829, while on board the steamship Benjamin Franklin in Long Island Sound during passage from Boston to Washington, D.C. He was last seen at about 2 A.M., and his hat and cloak were found on deck, leading to the conclusion that he had intentionally jumped. His body washed ashore on June 10. An alcoholic, Adams had left notes hinting that he intended to kill himself; he had appeared to be delusional while on the ship, asking the captain to return to shore and declaring that the other passengers were conspiring against him. The consensus in news accounts of the time and among historians subsequently is that he committed suicide, by drowning after he jumped from the Benjamin Franklin.Shepherd, Jack, Cannibals of the Heart: A Personal Biography of Louisa Catherine and John Quincy Adams, New York, McGraw-Hill 1980  Family  Adams and his brothers Charles and John were all rivals for the same woman, their cousin Mary Catherine Hellen, who lived with the John Quincy Adams family after the death of her parents. In 1828, John Adams II married Mary Hellen at a ceremony in the White House, and both his brothers refused to attend.Paul C.

It is in the centre of a gold mining area. In March 2012 it became the administrative headquarters of the newly created Geita Region. History Geita first came into prominence as the site of a German colonial gold mine. A German gold prospector discovered the mineral in the early 1900s in the hills surrounding modern-day Geita town. This and other discoveries triggered a gold rush in the surrounding area, attracting German and native prospectors alike. The colonial government established a mine to exploit 'Bismarck Reef'. Mining activities significantly declined, however, when Germany ceded control of its colonies to the British after their defeat in World War I. Geita regained prominence in the mid to late 1990s when the Tanzanian government opened the mineral sector to foreign investment. A number of medium to large-scale mining houses, including Ashanti and Anglo-American, conducted extensive exploration activities in the surrounding areas. The most significant outcome of those activities was the construction of the Geita Gold Mine, now owned by AngloGold Ashanti. The Geita Gold Mine is Tanzania's largest gold producer. Gold rushes continue to occur in areas surrounding Geita, mainly in and around Rwamagasa and Matabe. These gold rushes have attracted tens of thousands of prospectors from all around the country.

Sayce, p.793-4; \\"Armenia (Zoroastrian)\\", by M(ardiros). H. Ananikian, p.794-802; in Encyclop√¶dia of Religion and Ethics, ed. James Hastings, vol. 1, 1908 Formation of Armenian mythology Side view of the Temple of Garni. The pantheon of Armenian gods, initially worshipped by Proto- Armenians, inherited their essential elements from the religious beliefs and mythologies of the Proto-Indo-Europeans and peoples of the Armenian Highlands. Historians distinguish a significant body of Indo-European language words which were used in Armenian pagan rites. The oldest cults are believed to have worshipped a creator called Ar (or possibly Ara), embodied as the sun (Arev or Areg); the ancient Armenians called themselves \\"children of the sun\\". Also among the most ancient types of Indo-European-derived worship are the cults of eagles and lions, and of the sky. After the establishment of Iranian dominance in Armenia in the 1st millennium BCE, Zoroastrianism had a major influence on Armenian religion. Until the late Parthian period, the Armenian lands adhered to a syncretic form of Mazdaism, which mixed Iranian religious concepts with traditional Armenian beliefs. For example, the supreme god of the Armenian pantheon, Vanatur, was later replaced by Aramazd (the Parthian form of Ahura Mazda).Mary Boyce. Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices Psychology Press, 2001 p 84 However, the Armenian version of Aramazd preserved many native Armenian aspects. Similarly, the traditional Armenian goddess of fertility, Nar, was replaced by Anahit, which may derived from Persian Anahita, although the Armenian goddess was entirely distinct from her Iranian counterpart. In the Hellenistic age (3rd to 1st centuries BCE), ancient Armenian deities were identified with ancient Greek deities: Aramazd with Zeus, Anahit with Artemis, Vahagn with Heracles, Ast≈Çik with Aphrodite, Nane with Athena, Mihr with Hephaestus, Tir with Apollo. After the formal adoption of Christianity in the 4th century CE, ancient myths and beliefs transformed to adhere more closely to Christian beliefs. Biblical characters took over the functions of the archaic gods and spirits. For example, John the Baptist inherited certain features of Vahagn and Tir, and the archangel Gabriel took on elements of Vahagn. Basic information about Armenian pagan traditions were preserved in the works of ancient Greek authors such as Plato, Herodotus, Xenophon and Strabo, Byzantine scholar Procopius of Caesarea, as well as medieval Armenian writers such as Movses Khorenatsi, Agathangelos, Eznik of Kolb, Sebeos, and Anania Shirakatsi, as well as in oral folk traditions. Pantheon The pantheon of pre-Christian Armenia changed over the centuries. Originally native Armenian (from Proto-Indo-European) in nature, the pantheon was modified through Anatolian, Hurro-Urartian, Semitic, Iranian, and Greek influences. One common motif that spanned many or all pagan Armenian pantheons was the belief in a ruling triad of supreme gods, usually comprising a chief, creator god, his thunder god son, and a mother goddess. =Early Armenian= These gods are believed to have been native Armenian gods, worshipped during the earliest eras of Armenian history (Proto-Armenian). Many, if not all, of them are believed to have derived from Proto-Indo-European religion. There is also likely influence from the indigenous beliefs of the Armenian Highlands. *Areg (Arev) or Ar, god of the Sun, comparable with Hindu Ravi.Martirosyan, Hrach Origins and historical development of the Armenian language (2014) pp. 13 Likely also known as, or developed into, Ara. * Ast≈Çik,Petrosyan, Armen The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic (2002) pp. 68. cognate to the Mesopotamian goddess Inanna, identified with Venus.

Possibly the sister of Artinis (from Armenian: siela=sister, ardi=sun god) *Saris - Probably a corruption of Ishtar. *Huba - Wife of Theispas. Version of Hebat. =Iranian influence= Zoroastrian influences penetrated Armenian culture during the Achaemenid Empire, though conversion was incomplete and syncretistic, and the Persians and Armenians never appeared to identify with each other as co-religionists despite both referring to themselves as \\"Mazda worshipers.\\" * Aramazd - Cognate of the Iranian Ahura Mazda (or Ormazd), possibly mixed with Ara or Aram. Head of the pantheon, identified with Zeus in the interpretatio graeca, with whom he shared many titles. Along with Anahit and Vahagn formed a lead triad. Equated with Vanatur and Aram and Ara, all of which he took aspects from. In time, the positive functions of Baal Shamin were absorbed by Aramazd. * Anadatus - The Armenian form of the Zoroastrian Amesha Spenta Ameretat. * Anahit - Cognate of the Iranian Anahita. Probably originally related to Sumerian Inanna and Babylonian Anunit (Ishtar, Astarte) prior to Iranian presence in the region. The goddess of fertility and birth, and daughter or wife of Aramazd, Anahit is also identified with Artemis and Aphrodite. Temples dedicated to Anahit were established in Ani-Kammakh, Armavir, Artashat, Ashtishat. Ani is likely a derivation or alternate form of Anahit. * Mihr - Cognate with the Iranian Mithra. God of the sun and light, son of Aramazd, the brother of Anahit and Nane. Historically, despite his high place in the pantheon, worship of Mihr was eclipsed by Vahagn (indeed, Mihr's worship appears to have been supplementary to Vahagn's\\"Mihr\\" in Facts on File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, Third Edition, by Anthony Mercanante and James Dow, Infobase, 2009. p.671), and little is known about his worship aside from similarities to the Iranian Mithra and the absence of the Mithraic mysteries. Mihr was identified with Hephaestus by Movses Khorenatsi and later authors. His center of worship was located in Bagaharich, and the temple of Garni was dedicated to him. * Omanos - The Armenian form of the Zoroastrian Vohu Manah. * Spandaramet - Cognate of the Iranian Spenta Armaiti,\\"Santamaret\\" in Facts on File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, Third Edition, by Anthony Mercanante and James Dow, Infobase, 2009. p.861 a daughter of Aramazd, and cthonic goddess of fertility, vineyards and the underworld. Spandaramet was chosen by translators of some Armenian Bibles to convey the meaning of ŒîŒπœåŒΩœÖœÉŒøœÇ) in 2 Maccabees 6:7. Sometimes called Sandaramet or Santamaret denoting a connection to the underworld unique to Armenian theology, even in Christian writings. Her kingdom is said to be inhabited by evil spirits called Santarametakans.Coulter, Charles Russell. Turner, Patricia. \\"Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities\\" McFarland & Co., Routledge, 2012; pg. 438. * Tir or Tiur - Cognate to either the Iranian Tir (or Tishtrya) or (via Armenian dpir \\"scribe\\") the Babylonian Nabu. In either case, the mercurial god of wisdom, written language, culture, and science; messenger of the gods and psychopomp.\\"Tiur (Tur)\\" in Facts on File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, Third Edition, by Anthony Mercanante and James Dow, Infobase, 2009. p.959 Identified with the Greek Apollo. Tir's role as psychopomp may have been absorbed from the Luwian thunder god Tarhunda, whose name had been used to translate that of the Mesopotamian underworld god Nergal. Tir's temple was located near Artashat. * Vahagn - A \\"k'aj\\" (brave). Etymologically derived from Iranian Verethragna (via Vahram -> Vram -> Vam + -agn), however, the Armenian Vahagn had little to do with his Iranian namesake.Petrosyan, Armen The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic (2002) pp. 36. The storm god and dragon slayer, identified with the Greek Hercules, this identification went full circle when Armenian translators of the Bible used Vahagn to translate ·º©œÅŒ±Œ∫Œª·øÜœÇ in 2 Maccabees 4:19. Sometimes referred to by the title Tsovean, particularly in his role as a god of the seas. Vahagn may have originally been the Hayasan god, Terittitunni,Petrosyan, Armen The Indo- European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic (2002) pp. 41. who adopted some features of the Hurro-Urartian storm god Teshub/Teisheba. Christian folklore absorbed Vahagn's role as a storm or weather god into the archangel Gabriel. Derik housed the central temple to Vahagn. =Post- Alexandrian influences= * Barsamin - God of sky and weather, derived from the Semitic god Baal Shamin. * Nane - Cognate of the Elamitic Nanƒì, (via the Babylonian Nan√¢),\\"Nane (Hanea)\\" in Facts on File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, Third Edition, by Anthony Mercanante and James Dow, Infobase, 2009. p.703 also assimilating aspects of the Phrygian Cybele.\\"Armenian Mythology\\" in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, by David Leeming, Oxford University Press, 17 Nov 2005, p.29 Daughter of Aramazd, sister of Anahit and Mihr. A goddess of motherhood, war, and wisdom. Identified with Athena. Her cult was related to Anahit, both of their temples located near each other in Gavar. Monsters and spirits Aralez on the battlefield. * Al - The Al is a dwarfish evil spirit that attacks pregnant women and steals newborn babies. Described as half-animal and half-man, its teeth are of iron and nails of brass or copper. It usually wears a pointed hat covered in bells, and can become invisible.A History of Armenia by Vahan M. Kurkjianhttp://bulfinch.englishatheist.org/armenian/chapter11.htm * Aralez - Aralezner - The oldest gods in the Armenian pantheon, Aralez are dog-like creatures (modeled on Gampr) with powers to resuscitate fallen warriors and resurrect the dead by licking wounds clean. * Devs - The Dev are air-composed spirit creatures originating from Zoroastrian mythology (the Daevas), and share many similarities to angels and demons. They reside in stony places and ruins, and usually kept to themselves. * Shahapet - The Shahapet (’ç’∞’°’∞’°’∫’•’ø), also called Khshathrapti, Shavod, Shoithrapaiti, Shvaz and Shvod, were usually friendly guardian spirits of Armenian, Slavic and Persian mythology, who typically appeared in the form of serpents. They inhabited houses, orchards, fields, forests and graveyards, among other places. The Shvaz type was more agriculturally oriented, while the Shvod was a guardian of the home. A Shvod who is well-treated may reward the home's inhabitants with gold, but if mistreated might cause strife and leave. * Nhang - The Nhang (from the Persian word for \\"crocodile\\") was a river-dwelling serpent-monster with shape shifting powers, often connected to the more conventional Armenian dragons. The creature could change into a seal or lure a man by transforming into a woman, then drag in and drown the victim to drink its blood. The word \\"Nhang\\" is sometimes used as a generic term for a sea-monster in ancient Armenian literature. * Piatek - The Piatek is a large mammalian creature similar to a wingless griffin. *Vishap - A dragon closely associated with water, similar to the Leviathan. It is usually depicted as a winged snake or with a combination of elements from different animals. Vishap is an Iranian borrowing. Prior to Iranian domination in Armenia, the dragons may have been called \\"gegh\\".Petrosyan, Armen, Indo-European *wel- in Armenian mythology Journal of Indo-European Studies. (2016). pp. 134-135.

These figures are mainly known through post-Christian sources, but may have belonged to the pre-Christian mythology. Many seem to be derived from Proto-Indo-European mythologies and religious traditions. It is suspected that Hayk, Ara, and Aram were originally deities, possibly from the oldest Armenian pantheon.Petrosyan, Armen The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic (2002) pp. 57. * Ara the Handsome, son of Aram. A handsome warrior slain in a war against Semiramis, in some versions brought back to life by her prayers. Possibly, originally a personified version of the sun god Ar (Arev). * Aram, slayer of the giant Barsamin, possibly originally a war god known as Aremenius.\\"Aram\\" in Facts on File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, Third Edition, by Anthony Mercanante and James Dow, Infobase, 2009. p.96 Father of Ara.

Karapet is usually represented as a glittering long-haired thunder-god with a purple crown and a cross. * Nimrod, great-grandson of Noah and the king of Shinar, Nimrod is depicted in the Bible as both a man of power in the earth and a mighty hunter. * Sanasar and Baghdasar, two brothers founded the town of Sason, ushering in the eponymous state. Sanasar was considered the ancestor of several generations of heroes of Sassoon. It is said that their mother was subject to a miraculous pregnancy, by drinking water from a certain fountain.Hoogasian- Villa, Susie. 100 Armenian Tales and Their Folkloristic Relevance.

Whalan is located 44 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History Whalan takes its name from James Whalan, who was granted at Mount Druitt by Governor Ralph Darling in 1831. His father was Sergeant Charles Whalan who was Governor Lachlan Macquarie's orderly sergeant and in charge of the Light Horse Guard. James Whalan explored the areas around Jenolan Caves and the Blue Mountains and discovered the rock formation known as Grand Arch pursuing the bushranger McKeown. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 5,973 people in Whalan. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.7% of the population. * 63.4% of people were born in Australia. The nextmost common countries of birth were New Zealand 4.0%, Philippines 3.0%, Samoa 2.3%, Fiji 2.2% and England 1.7%. * 65.5% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Samoan 4.3%, Arabic 2.7%, Hindi 2.3% and Tagalog 1.8%. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 24.9%, No Religion 21.1% and Anglican 15.0%. Parks and recreation Whalan has an extensive reserve that is made up of four soccer fields and four football fields. It also has numerous parks and a large go-cart track that is available to use every Saturday. As well there are numerous smaller parks and reserves dotted around the leafy suburb including RAAF Park on the eastern boundary. This park is a memorial to the RAAF camp that was on the site during WW2. There was also an airfield nearby with the runway still in existence as the main road access to Whalan Reserve. The old Mt Druitt motor racing track used to run along this runway and parts of Luxford Road and Kuringai Ave prior to the NSW Housing Commission developing the area in the mid-1960s. Schools Whalan has three public schools, Whalan Public, Madang Public and the special needs school, Halinda. Whalan High School was closed shortly after the debacle involving the Daily Telegraph newspaper and Mt Druitt High School HSC students who were wrongfully labelled as 'failures' (for which the newspaper apologised and settled out of court a class action brought by students and teachers). Several high schools in the area were closed and reorganised as Chifley College with campuses at Dharruk, Shalvey, North St Marys and Bidwill. Halinda and the PCYC offices are now using the grounds and buildings.

Woodcroft is located 42 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History From 1969 to 1988 Woodcroft was the State Brickworks in Doonside (and prior to 1969 it was the location of the State Timberworks). In 1989, the land was purchased by estate agents and developers LJ Hooker. After rezoning, residential construction commenced in 1992 and Woodcroft was formally recognised as a suburb in 1996. Commercial area There is a modest independent retail mall on Richmond Road. Services include a service station, supermarket, doctor's surgery, and a variety of independent and franchise fast food outlets. Facilities such as disabled toilets, parenting rooms, and children's play areas, are limited. Transport The Blacktown Social Plan shows that Woodcroft households are much more likely to have one car than is usual across both the city of Blacktown, and the Sydney greater metropolitan area. However they are also much less likely to have two or more cars than is usual. This is somewhat of an indication of the transport connections throughout the area and the demographic of the population. Access to public transport is somewhat limited, being via bus to either Blacktown, Doonside or Quakers Hill railway stations. Most households have one car. The M7 motorway is accessible to Woodcroft via either the Richmond Road or Quakers Hill Parkway. Since it opened in December 2005 this has improved access to the Hills District, Liverpool and providing connections to both the M2 and M4 motorways. Housing The predominant form of housing throughout the suburb is free standing single homes; no residences are apartments and 19.0% are townhouses, semi-detached or similar. This modern, low density housing is a reflection of the standard of living throughout the suburb. Landmarks Woodcroft Neighbourhood Centre entry viewed from park. =Woodcroft Lake= Woodcroft features a small man-made lake called Woodcroft Lake, on the area of a former Brick Pit. Each year, in September, the lake and surrounding park is home to the Woodcroft Festival. =Woodcroft Neighbourhood Centre= In 2019, a new Neighbourhood Centre designed by Carter Williamson Architects was opened . Replacing the previous neighbourhood centre which was destroyed by fire in 2015. Population The Blacktown Social Plan indicates that between 1996 and 2001 census, the population increased from 1683 to 4969 people, an increase of over 195%. This is linked directly to the level of residential development occurring throughout the 1990s. It has since stabilised somewhat, growing to 5,355 in 2006 and 6,440 at the . 23.1% of the population was born in the Philippines in 2011, the highest proportion born in the Philippines in Sydney. This had fallen slightly to 21.1% in 2016. The Blacktown Social Plan shows that compared to the averages across both the City of Blacktown, and the Sydney greater metropolitan area, residents of Woodcroft are more likely to be English literate migrants, working in white collar jobs. They are also very likely to be buying their own house and to be living as a couple with children. Since there are relatively sparse retail services here, the majority of residents are more likely to work and shop in nearby city centres such as Blacktown, Parramatta or Penrith. Due to an influx of professionals in the last couple of years together with excellent train connectivity via surrounding train stations, many people travel to Sydney for work.

She held the four papƒÅ (district) titles which gave her the paramount status of Tafa‚ÄòifƒÅ ('one supported by four') on the western islands of Samoa. Contrary to popular belief she was not the first Tafa'ifƒÅ, as these titles were willed to her by their previous possessor, Nafanua (Tonumaipe'a NƒÅfanua).Queen Salamasina, More Women Rulers - Women in World History Curriculum Family history SalamƒÅsina descended from several powerful royal bloodlines. Her mother, Vaetoefaga, was an extremely highborn noblewoman who enjoyed a lofty position in both Samoan and Tongan societies. Vaetoefaga's father was the Tu‚Äòi Tonga Kau‚Äòulufonua II (a son of Tu'i Tonga Kau'ulufonua I and the Samoan noblewoman Vainu'ulasi) and her mother was TaupoimƒÅsina (the daughter of high chief Lefono of Amoa, Savai'i). As a teenager Vaetoefaga became the tenth and last wife of the Samoan paramount Tuia‚Äòana Tamaalelagi, with whom she conceived their daughter SalamƒÅsina. One of Tamaalelagi's royal attendants named Utufanunutunutu traveled to the Tongan island of Tongatapu with the intent of securing Vaetoefaga as Tamaalelagi's wife. He deceived her family with fantastical stories about the land and people of Samoa and succeeded in arranging the marriage and an impressive dowry. As part of the arrangement, Vaetoefaga's brother UlualofaigƒÅ was given political concessions in Fagaloa (in Atua district). Vaetoefaga prompted the construction of the Tuia‚Äòana's ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù residence (akin to a vacation home) near Vaialua in Nofoali‚Äòi, A‚Äòana after being threatened by the families of Tamaalelagi's other wives. Vaetoefaga left Nu‚Äòuausala (the Tuia‚Äòana's residence in Leulumoega) to seek refuge among her Tongan relatives who had settled in the villages allotted to her brother (Tamasese 2004:10). Her home was named Afeafe-o-Vaetoefaga (‚Äúrefuge of Vaetoefaga) to commemorate this fearful time of persecution and conflict between the budding Tongan community and the established Samoan factions. Life SalamƒÅsina‚Äôs mother, Vaetoefaga, returned to Tonga and entrusted SalamƒÅsina to the safe-keeping of Levalasi So‚Äòoa‚Äòemalelagi. So'oa'emalelagi was the principal wife of the leading chieftain of the Atua district, TuiƒÅtua MƒÅta‚Äòutia, and SalamƒÅsina was raised as their own daughter. =Adulthood and reign= She was betrothed as a youth to marry a chief named Tonumaipe‚Äòa Tapumanaia in order to form a political alliance with the influential Tonumaipe‚Äòa faction of Savai‚Äòi. However, SalamƒÅsina eloped with the man of her choice, the untitled Alapepe. Their relationship brought forth a daughter named Lupefofoaivaoese, who grew to become Tuia‚Äòana and the ancestress of several prominent Samoan families. Alapepe was pursued by the furious Tonumaipe‚Äòa clan to Tongatapu, where he was killed for ‚Äúdefiling‚Äù the taupou. SalamƒÅsina also had a son by Tapumanaia, who was named after his father. He later received the LesƒÅtele title of the Salani and SƒÅlesƒÅtele villages in Falealili, Atua, ‚ÄòUpolu. Queen SalamƒÅsina had a long and peaceful reign in Mulifusi, Lotofaga, Atua, ‚ÄòUpolu. She had attained the lofty status of Tafa‚ÄòifƒÅ during her lifetime and both her son (by Tapumanaia) and her daughter (by Alapepe) inherited high rank and prestige through her. Her reign is notable in Samoan history for its absence of warfare and many Samoans today feel pride in tracing their ancestry to Queen Salamasina.  Legacy  Scholars have been particularly interested in SalamƒÅsina's life (and the fact that her supreme titles passed on to her chiefly descendants primarily through her daughter Lupefofoaivaoese) because ancient Samoa has often been portrayed as a male dominated society. Penelope Schoeffel and Gavan Daws point to SalamƒÅsina's significance as the ancestor of many powerful Samoan rulers: > Salamasina's historical significance was that she was the means of drawing > together all the great aristocratic bloodlines and links to supernatural > power in a period of political transformation, to create a basis of > legitimacy for the new power-brokers of Samoa, the orator group Tumua of > A'ana and Atua. For the next four centuries or so, they were to manipulate > the new dynasty she gave birth to through control of the paramount titles > which they were empowered to bestow.

It is shared with the ethnic Lao that inhabit the Isan region of Thailand as well. There are mainly two types of dances (or dance-dramas), the classical dances performed in the royal courts and the folk dances now associated with morlam.Laos. (2001). Rubin, D., Pong C. S., Caturvedi, R., et al (ed.) World encyclopedia of contemporary theatre: Asia/Pacific. (Vol. III). New York, NY: Routlegde. Shadow puppetry, although not associated with dance, is an important part of Lao theatrical traditions. Various dance-drama troupes, mostly operating out of Louang Phrabang and Vientiane, continue to teach the old classical court dances and more Khmer-influenced dramas and folk dances, respectively. Classical dance and theatre The dance-dramas of Laos were originally only performed for the royal court. The dance-dramas and musical accompaniment are all very similar to those of Thai and Cambodian classical dances. Lao legends of the first ruler of Lan Xang say that in addition to a large army of Khmer soldiers, he was also accompanied by many female dancers from the court of Angkor.Ray, N. (2007). Vietnam, cambodia, laos and the greater mekong. Oakland, California: Lonely Planet Publishers. Most dance dramas depict scenes from the Phra Lak Phra Ram (‡∫û‡∫£‡∫∞‡∫•‡∫±‡∫Å‡∫û‡∫£‡∫∞‡∫£‡∫≤‡∫° ), or the Lao Ramayana and the Sadok (‡∫ä‡∫≤‡∫î‡∫ª‡∫Å ), or Jataka. Other scenes come from legends, historical epics such as Sin Xay , stories from local or Hindu mythology, or adaptations of stories from surrounding nations. Lao classical dance has two main forms, khone and lakhone. Each is accompanied by Lao classical music. Masked dancers about to perform a khon dance-drama based on the Phra Lak Phra Ram. Khon (‡ªÇ‡∫Ç‡∫ô ) is the most stylised of the Lao dance-dramas, with troupes of male and female dancers in elaborate costumes and masks performing very graceful movements demonstrating their great flexibility, and very common dance-drama form for the Phra Lak Phra Ram. Each dancer plays a character in the drama, although most of the narration comes from a singing chorus to the side. Lakhone (‡∫•‡∫∞‡∫Ñ‡∫≠‡∫ô ) dances are usually only performed by females, but male lakhone dancers are not unknown. Instead of each dancer portraying an individual character, such as the Khon dance-dramas, the dancers mimic the scene and events together. There is more variety of dance-dramas performed in the Lakhon tradition.Brandon, J. R. (1993). The cambridge guide to asian theatre. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Although lacking in dance, nang taloung or shadow puppets (‡ªú‡∫±‡∫á‡∫ï‡∫∞‡∫•‡∫∏‡∫á ) are an important part of Lao theatrical traditions. An adaptation of the traditional Malay wayang shadow puppets, but there are numerous puppeteers instead of one puppet master. Shadow puppet plays are based on similar themes and stories as the other classical dramas, but can be accompanied by either classical music or morlam instrumentation.B., Rachel, Lam, M. B., Cullen, A. et al (2007). World and its peoples: eastern and southern asia. Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish Corp. Lam lao A khene player and Lao dancers at a morlam performance in France. Lam Lao (‡∫•‡∫≥‡∫•‡∫≤‡∫ß) or morlam (‡ªù‡ªç‡∫•‡∫≥ ) is the general descriptor for Lao folk music, which at its most basic level consists of the singer/story-teller and the khene (‡ªÅ‡∫Ñ‡∫ô ). In Isan, both terms are interchangeable, but in Laos, morlam only refers to the singer. Troupes travel around like minstrels performing at various locales. There are many regional styles, depending on the local tone contours and preferred instrumentation and melodies.B., Rachel, Lam, M. B., Cullen, A. et al (2007). The music that accompanies a lam lao performance may also include various types of percussion, fiddles, lutes, xylophones, or oboes as well as some that are more characteristic of classical ensembles. Lyrics are drawn from old poetry, classical stories, or improvised according to the complicated tonal rhyming patterns of the verse and can range from topics as serious as religious sermons and Jataka tales to sometimes bawdy verses about love and sex. Although the performances themselves are not necessarily theatrical, the closest being the exchanges of witty repart√©es in alternating verses or songs between a male and a female morlam who pretend to fall in love before departing or friends who try to outwit each other. The songs are interspersed with dance numbers, comedic routines, ham acting, and teasing between the performers and the audience.Brandon, J. R. (1993). =Folk dance= A folk dance in the Rocket Festival parade in Yasothorn, Thailand. The Lao of Isan have preserved Lao cultural traditions, including morlam and folk music. Lao folk dances (‡∫ü‡ªâ‡∫≠‡∫ô‡∫•‡∫≥‡∫û‡∫∑‡ªâ‡∫ô‡ªÄ‡∫°‡∫∑‡∫≠‡∫á ) are numerous and varied, much like lam lao. In fact, most lam also have an associated folk dance. And Other popular dances include the southern lam Tang Vai (‡∫•‡∫≥‡∫ï‡∫±‡∫á‡∫´‡∫ß‡∫≤‡∫Ω ) and Lam Saravane (‡∫•‡∫≥‡∫™‡∫≤‡∫£‡∫∞‡∫ß‡∫±‡∫ô ).Lao cultural profile. (2008, February 26). Retrieved from http://www.culturalprofiles.net/laos/Directories/Laos_Cultural_Profile/-54.html The most popular folk dance, however, is the lam vong (‡∫•‡∫≥‡∫ß‡∫ª‡∫á ). It is the national dance of Laos, and versions of it exist throughout the Lao-speaking region and even Cambodia, where it is known as ramvong. A slow and graceful couples dance, the men form an inner circle and the women an outer circle, with couples dancing around each other while moving in their respective circles. It is a common feature of weddings, celebrations, and other social events.Mansfield, S. and Koh, M. (2008). Cultures of the world: laos. Tarrytown, NY: Marshall Cavendish Corp. =Lam luang (likay lao)= A truly theatrical derivative of morlam, it is believed to have developed when the morlam began to dress up and act out various characters from the sung repertoire of oral traditions, myths and legends.it is better known as Lam Luang (‡∫•‡∫≥‡ªÄ‡∫£‡∫∑‡ªà‡∫≠‡∫á ) or sung story. Stories range from traditional to lewd, serious to bawdy, and are drawn from a diverse range of sources, such as the traditional stories and Jataka tales to even development projects and community concerns. Music can be classical, morlam, or even modern, and costumes also run the gamut depending on the needs of the story.Clewley, J. (2001). 'Laos: beyond our khaen.'

Other cast include Damian Lau, Anthony Wong Chau-Sang, Paul Chun, James Pak and Yan Yee Kwan. The main characters of the film are reunited in a sequel, another 1993 film, Executioners.

The police are powerless, and the city must be saved by three very different women who share a terrible past. Anita Mui plays the mild-mannered wife of a police inspector who's also the mask-wearing, sword-slinging and knife-throwing crime fighter, Wonder Woman. Maggie Cheung plays the shotgun-toting, hard-boiled bounty hunter, Thief Catcher. Michelle Yeoh is Invisible Woman, the troubled but determined strong right arm of the Evil Master. Characters =Female Heroes= Wonder Woman Wonder Woman is a crime fighting vigilante, trained from childhood by her strict martial arts master father. Her secret identity is Tung, wife of Police Inspector Lau, who eventually finds out who she is. Aside from her fighting prowess, she uses a collapsible sword and throwing knives in the shape of butterfly wings. She is played by Anita Mui. She is referred to as Shadow Fox in the English dub. Invisible Woman Ching aka Ching Ching is the martial sister of Tung, and left their disciplinarian father as a child. She was then taken in by Evil Master, and serves as his main servant. Though the Thief Catcher is her childhood friend, the two are only reunited as adults. Ching is responsible for the kidnapping of the babies using an invisible robe, which is given to her by the Professor. She is ordered to kill the Professor for the robe, but is conflicted because she has fallen in love with him, eventually deciding to fight in his memory after he dies. Ching is known to the Evil Master as \\"Number 3\\". She is the most skilled fighter of the trio, and uses a chain whip. She is portrayed by actress Michelle Yeoh in the film. Thief Catcher Thief Catcher is an irresponsible and greedy bounty hunter. She is initially hired by the Police Chief to rescue his own kidnapped son, and she steals a baby from the hospital as bait for the kidnapper. In the ensuing struggle with Wonder Woman, the baby is accidentally killed, causing her to reevaluate her life. She grew up and underwent similar training with Ching as a child, though she escaped after 3 years (taking another 10 to regain her humanity); her designation was originally \\"Number 7\\". She is referred to as Mercy (short for Mercenary) in the English dub. Often, she prefers to use her rifle and explosives in a fight, though she also has a boomerang-like sword. She is also an expert motorcycle rider. She is played by Maggie Cheung. =Villains= The Evil Master He is the main villain of the film. He compels Ching to steal newborn babies as part of his supernatural scheme to provide China with a new emperor. Ching has worked for him for many years. The Thief Catcher likes to refer to him as \\"Damned Old Monster!\\" as she strongly dislikes him. Played by Shi-Kwan Yen. Production On its release, the film was promoted as a \\"ground-breaking novelty for Hong Kong cinema\\" Producer Ching Siu-Tung used the film to try to make a name for himself outside of his work with Tsui Hark while Johnnie To developed it as pitch to become accepted as one of Hong Kong's leading action film directors. Reception In contemporary reviews, Tony Rayns (Sight & Sound), stated that the film was visually similar to Kirk Wong's Health Warning, but \\"predictably takes none of that film's risks.\\" He noted that both Mui and Cheung approached \\"their iconic roles with gusto and deliver the odd camp frisson, while \\"Yeoh seems dispirited from start to finish.\\" Rayns complimented parts of the film, stating that it \\"offers a number of simple pleasures. Its design and mise en scene are expansive and occasionally exhilarating, and it has a good sense of intersperse scenes of would-be pathos between its action set-pieces.\\" Variety called the film a \\"flashy kung fu superheroine adventure full of solid production values but marred by some disturbingly gratuitous plot elements.\\" The review went on to note that the ambitious plot does \\"not always mesh with recurring comic-book tone. Full-blown climax has heroines battling their nemesis both above and below ground as the villain, as in ‚ÄúTerminator 2,‚Äù continues to struggle even when reduced to skeletal remains.\\" From retrospective reviews, Donald C Willis described the film as \\"an amusing series of outrageous stunts\\" in his book Horror and Science Fiction Film IV.

Publication history Mesmero first appeared in X-Men #49 and was created by Arnold Drake, Don Heck, and Werner Roth. Fictional character biography Mesmero was originally a small-time crook who posed as a stage hypnotist at high society parties. He would use his mutant powers to 'mesmerize' guests into giving him their possessions and then making them forget about them. Mesmero drew the attention of Magneto, who wanted him to hypnotize Lorna Dane into believing that she was Magneto's daughter. Mesmero successfully took control of large numbers of latent mutants, and captured Lorna Dane.X-Men #49 Mesmero was then revealed to be the aide to Magneto, and battled the X-Men in the city of the Demi-Men.X-Men #50-52 Mesmero's master was later revealed to be a robot in the form of Magneto, and a Sentinel attack resulted in Mesmero being captured by Sentinels.X-Men #60 Much later, Mesmero had become a carnival manager and mentally compelled the X-Men to serve as carnival performers. The X-Men freed themselves from his control, and as Mesmero then attacked the X-Men, the real Magneto appeared. The Master of Magnetism overpowered Mesmero and rendered him unconscious.X-Men #111; Classic X-Men #17 Magneto then stranded him in a South American jungle.X-Men #112 Mesmero later performed in a Broadway stage show in New York City, where he battled Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man #207 Mesmero later escaped to Canada. There, he contended with Alpha Flight and was captured by Persuasion.Alpha Flight #43 Mesmero later posed as a psychoanalyst to powerful clients in London. He took control of Excalibur and used them to battle Fenris. Mesmero was defeated by Lockheed the dragon and students from St. Searle's School for Young Ladies.Excalibur #32-34 Mesmero has encountered the X-Men on a few other occasions as well as teams such as X-Factor, and the Dark Riders. The Dark Riders intended to kill him, as they believe he was weak. Mesmero uses his powers to convince them they had thrown him off a high ledge.X-Men (Second Series) #14 With Alpha Flight, Mesmero takes over the minds of the junior members and is eventually stopped by the senior ones.Alpha Flight First Series #43 When Mesmero joined the latest incarnation of the Weapon X program, the Director offered to increase Mesmero's hypnotic powers. Mesmero agreed and gained the ability to control entire crowds with a mere glance, instead of a mere handful of people.Weapon X #1/2 Wizard Special To keep the public unaware of the \\"Neverland\\" mutant concentration camp, Mesmero posed as a government liaison. With this identity, he informed news reporters that \\"Neverland\\" doesn't exist nor is the government involved in abducting mutants.Alpha Fight (Second Series) #4-5 While he was a member of Weapon X, Mesmero visited his dying mother. He had doctors help her as much as they could and used his powers to mesmerise his mother into believing she was healthy as ever. His mother knew it was an illusion, though, and she told him that she knew shortly before she died. Subsequently, Mesmero began to lose confidence in himself which caused him to lose his powers. Mesmero was transported to Neverland upon the Director's discovery of his power loss.Weapon X #11 Brent Jackson, planning on raising a coup on Weapon X, rescued Mesmero. Mesmero spent several months in seclusion as Jackson helped him get his confidence back, and with it his powers. Mesmero eventually lost his powers for good (along with most of the world's mutants) when the Scarlet Witch altered reality at the climax of the House of M event during Decimation. Devastated and ruined, the once-great supervillain was forced into poverty.X-Men Unlimited Volume 2 #13 Mesmero finally achieved a personal triumph by forming a relationship with a woman who had saved his life, promising to somehow help her in turn. She put her trust in him freely and unconditionally, something he had never managed before without the aid of his powers. At this, Mesmero resolved to put his past behind him and begin living as Vincent.X-Men Unlimited #17 Mesmero eventually returned to his old life of villainy and became the leader of a newly formed Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He also appeared to have gotten his powers back.X-Men Gold (vol. 2) #2 He first had his Brotherhood attack the United Nations and was thwarted by the X-Men. He then had his Brotherhood kidnap the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio. It was also discovered by the X-Men that Mesmero had used his powers to brainwash the members of his Brotherhood to join the team and force them to carry out those attacks. Once his control was broken, Mesmero's Brotherhood was dissolved, and Mesmero was arrested. The reason for Mesmero's actions was that he was paid by Lydia Nance, director of the anti-mutant Heritage Initiative, to carry out these acts in order to paint mutants in a bad light.X-Men Gold (vol. 2) #3 Powers and abilities Mesmero was a mutant who has the psionic ability to mentally control the minds of others. Through a combination of careful planning and skill, he could also manipulate the minds of telepaths; though he had to take extreme care, as a telepath was much more prone to realizing/breaking his machinations than a non-psi. He could hypnotize people into doing what he wanted them to do, and alter their minds with false personalities and memories. He could also make them see him as a different person. Mesmero has proved unable to control Magneto, due to his helmet which negates all psychic attacks pertaining to mental influence, and Alysande Stuart with his powers, for unknown reasons. Mesmero's green skin, once believed to be a mask, is apparently his real skin color. It is not known if he was born this way, or if it developed later in life along with his powers. At one time, Mesmero wore a costume which allowed him to teleport, leaving only a blip of energy where he once stood. The feat was only used to escape an angry Alpha Flight, and may have been controlled entirely by the technology of the suit, or may have been tied in some way to his mental abilities. Other versions =Exiles= In Exiles, an alternate reality version of Mesmero, originating from the Earth-653 timeline, was involved with the Weapon X Program before being recruited into Weapon X, the more ruthless counterpart of the Exiles.Exiles Vol.1 #62 Early after the formation of the team, Mesmero was killed and his body remained in the Timebreakers' fallen heroes gallery in the crystal palace. After the Exiles took over the place, they sent Mesmero's body back to Earth-653. The corpse was teleported back to the facilities of the Weapon X Program, where it was incinerated.Exiles Vol.1 #65 Another alternate version of Mesmero was revealed to have existed on Earth-127. This Mesmero was part of the Brotherhood of Mutants alongside Magneto, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch (all gender-swapped, with Scarlet Witch now being called Scarlet Warlock). They planned to make Magneto (who was female in this reality) even powerful than she already was by removing Wolverine's adamantium skeleton out of his body and transfer it into Magneto's body. However the plan went wrong, and Mesmero and the other Brotherhood members fused into one powerful mutant being known as \\"Brother Mutant\\".Exiles Vol.1 #85 =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse timeline, Mesmero joined with a group of low level telepaths to create a kind of \\"psychic pyramid scheme\\" known as the Overmind which Quentin Quire, the mastermind behind the Overmind, uses to increase his own limited skills.Age of Apocalypse #5 (September 2012) Mesmero along with the telepaths that compose the Overmind are later confronted and killed by the Shadow King.Age of Apocalypse #11 (March 2013) =X-Men '92= During the Secret Wars storyline as part of the X-Men '92 mini-series (which is based on the 90's X-Men TV series), Mesmero was seen in a flashback as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants.X-Men '92 Infinite Comic #1 In other media =Television= * Mesmero makes a brief appearance in the X-Men episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil, Part Four\\". He is seen alongside many other mutant psychics. * Mesmero appears in the X-Men: Evolution animated series, voiced by Ron Halder in a Middle-Eastern accent. This version looks like a normal human, his main distinguishing feature being his facial tattoos, but is far more powerful and more adept at hand-to-hand combat than his comic version. The majority of his power is implied to come from Apocalypse; he is shown to match Professor X in his early appearances, but after being discarded by Apocalypse demonstrated no power whatsoever. In his first appearance in the episode \\"Mindbender\\", Mesmero used several members of the young X-Men (Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Spyke, and Shadowcat) to steal three rings. The three rings connected together with a golden rod to form a key that would open the first of three doors sealing away Apocalypse. He was eventually discovered by Professor X and Rogue, but managed to escape with the key. In the episode \\"Under Lock and Key\\", Mesmero mind-controlled Gambit to steal half of a spider stone from Warren Worthington III's mansion. In doing so, he was found and captured by Magneto, who had Mastermind extract the location of the other half of the stone from his mind. Uniting the stone pieces created a giant metallic spider, which Magneto destroyed. Only then did he learn that Mesmero had in fact tricked him into destroying it, as doing so was the only way to unlock the second door. In the two-part episode \\"Dark Horizon,\\" he tricked Mystique into unlocking the third door, as he was unable to control her mind. By unlocking the door, Mystique turned to stone. With his usefulness exhausted, Apocalypse discarded Mesmero. In the episode \\"Ascension\\" Pt. 1, Mesmero was subsequently captured by the X-Men, allowing Professor X to extract Apocalypse's master plan from his mind even though Mesmero still thinks that Apocalypse will return for him. * Mesmero appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Freaky\\", voiced by Dwight Schultz.http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id;=806 He is shown robbing a jewellery store with some hypnotized people when Spider-Man and Wolverine arrive and foil his scheme even after he sends his victims upon them. Mesmero is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D., but in revenge uses his special abilities to switch Spider-Man and Wolverine's minds without anyone noticing. After some identity confusions and a fight with Sabretooth, Spider- Man and Wolverine visit Mesmero in his cell on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier where he is forced to switched their minds back. When Mesmero swears revenge afterwards, Spider-Man webs his mouth shut. In the episode \\"The Incredible Spider-Hulk\\", Mesmero is seen in the Tri-Carrier's prison as Nick Fury tells Spider-Man that Mesmero plans to get into Hulk's mind as they have the safeguards in case Mesmero tries anything. A restrained Mesmero is brought into the room where Hulk is being held in. Spider-Man tries to prevent Mesmero from doing a mind trick to the Hulk which ends with Spider-Man's mind being swapped with Hulk's mind. When Spider-Man in Hulk's body tries to get Mesmero to switch their minds back, he accidentally frees Mesmero who gets away. At the bank, Mesmero hypnotizes the guards to help him rob the bank and then mesmerizes the taxicab driver to take him to the airport. When Thing lands near Mesmero's taxicab, Mesmero mind-controls him into attacking Spider-Man and Hulk. After Thing is freed from the mind-control, he, Spider-Man, and Hulk corner Mesmero and force him to switch their minds back. Mesmero then passes out in panic while at Hulk's mercy as S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives. In the episode \\"Burrito Run\\", Spider-Man, Power Man, and Squirrel Girl find Mesmero who has been tapping into people's cell phones in order to control their minds through the cellular network. Besides mind-controlling Batroc the Leaper, Boomerang, Grizzly, and Shocker, Mesmero manages to gain control of Squirrel Girl when she answers her cell phone. When on the rooftop with his special amplifier, Mesmero gets Boomerang, Grizzly, Shocker, and Squirrel Girl into defending him. Spider-Man uses liquid nitrogen to freeze Mesmero's legs. Spider-Man orders Mesmero to free everyone from his control and to forget whatever happened. Mesmero was later webbed up by Spider-Man alongside Boomerang and Shocker where they are left for the police.

He is a military scientist whose company Trask Industries is well known as the creator of the Sentinels. He is also the father of Larry Trask and Madame Sanctity. Publication history Bolivar Trask was created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, and first appeared in The X-Men #14 (November 1965). Fictional character biography Bolivar Trask was an anthropologist who saw the rise of mutants as a threat to humanity. Bolivar was the father of Larry Trask, ironically revealed to be a mutant precognitive. Bolivar had realized this, and gave his son a medallion which suppresses his power.Uncanny X-Men #59 (1969). Marvel Comics. Bolivar is also the father of Tanya, a mutant whose ability to travel through time causes her to vanish but is rescued by Rachel Summers in a far future and become a part of the Askani under the alias Madame Sanctity. Tanya's travels through time would result in property damage to Trask's land. This mysterious situation would only further cement his attitudes. Bolivar decides that humanity has to fight back against the mutants and develops robotic guardians for humanity, known as the Sentinels. Larry was shielded from the Sentinels' ability to detect mutants due to the medallion Bolivar had given his son. Bolivar publishes articles on the threat of mutants. One of these articles showed an illustration of mutant overlords keeping humans as slaves. This illustration would become a symbol for human/mutant relations and several years later Quentin Quire and his Omega Gang would base their appearance on this picture. Professor Charles Xavier invites Trask for a public debate on human/mutant relations. Xavier argues that mutants are just like humans and not evil, but that does not convince Trask revealing the Sentinels. But Trask and his scientists had apparently created a too adaptive, open-ended tactical/strategic programming, and as a result the Sentinels turn against him, claiming that they were superior to humans. The Sentinels left with Trask and brought him to his first creation, the Master Mold, who orders him to construct more Sentinels.Uncanny X-Men #15 (1965). Marvel Comics. To stop the Sentinels, Xavier summons the X-Men. The X-Men fight the Sentinels, but Beast is captured. To reveal the X-Men's secrets, the Sentinels tell Trask to use a device to read Beast's mind. Trask discovers that the X-Men were mutants protecting humanity and realizes that he had been wrong. He helps the X-Men defeat the Sentinels by sacrificing himself to destroy the Sentinel's base.Uncanny X-Men #16 (1965). Marvel Comics. Recently in X-Force, Bastion having been reactivated by the Purifiers has apparently resurrected Bolivar Trask through use of a Technarch to be part of a team of the world's foremost mutant killers. He was apparently given credit for the deaths of all mutants, being the inventor of the Sentinels, had the highest record of mutant kills: 16,521,618.X-Force (3rd series) #03 (2008). Marvel Comics. Consistent with the remorse he had displayed at the time of his death, Trask killed himself after escaping Bastion's mental control.X-Factor #206. Marvel Comics. Legacy Bolivar Trask's death would not be the end of the Sentinels: * Master Mold would return and Bolivar's son Larry Trask, still unaware of his own mutant status (who had prophetic dreams), would follow in his father's footsteps and create new Sentinels to avenge his father.Uncanny X-Men 57-59. Marvel Comics. * Later, Bolivar's nephew Donald Trask III would be recruited by the villain Cassandra Nova to gain control of a group of Sentinels in Ecuador. The machines, now varying in size, will not harm Trask DNA. They obey Donald's orders. However, once Nova is done copying all of Donald's DNA, Nova kills Donald and takes over the robots.New X-Men #114-115. Marvel Comics. * Bolivar Trask has a brother named Simon Trask, the founder of Humanity's Last Stand.Uncanny X-Men Annual 1995. Marvel Comics. Other versions =\\"Age of Apocalypse\\"= In the 1995 storyline \\"Age of Apocalypse\\", Bolivar Trask married Moira Kinross and together they designed heavily armed Sentinels to fight Apocalypse. These Sentinels were better programmed and even capable of reasoning with mutants if they protected humans (their primary objective). Bolivar participates in a plan to bomb North American Apocalypse forces, though this would mean extensive civilian deaths. He returns in the 2012 launched Age of Apocalypse ongoing series, as one of the leaders of the remaining human resistance. His daughter Francesca is a main operative in the X-Terminators (code-named \\"Fiend\\") alongside Prophet, Good Night, Horror Show, and Zora Risman aka DeadEye though she and Bolivar have a rocky relationship.Age of Apocalypse #1. Marvel Comics. =Civil War: House of M= In the 2008 miniseries Civil War: House of M, Bolivar Trask is sworn in as the Vice-President of the US and creates Sentinels to fight against Magneto in his rise to power.Civil War: House of M #3 (January, 2009). Marvel Comics. Magneto confronts him on board the Helicarrrier. Trask summons Sentinels in self- defense, but they go into non-lethal mode as the ship is staffed with humans. Trask over-rides this, causing the death of many SHIELD agents. Magneto then throws Trask into a Sentinel beam, causing his disintegration.Civil War: House of M #5 (March 2009). Marvel Comics. =X-Men Noir= In the 2009 - 2010 miniseries X-Men Noir, Bolivar Trask is a multitalented doctor of anthropology, and sociology, who is also a pulp sci-fi writer, and a public proponent of eugenics, though not a racist, as his leading characters possess the \\"finest\\" qualities of different ethnic groups. He is the writer of the pulp sci-fi series, \\"The Sentinels\\", about a race of genetically superior beings in the year 2013 who protect humanity from the grisly deformed \\"Mutants\\". His characters include Stephen Lang, creator of the Sentinels; Callisto, leader of inadequates/muties; sentinel commander Bastion, perfect sentinels Nimrod and Rachel as well as the mad Egyptian En Sabah Nur. =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Bolivar Trask is featured in Ultimate X-Men as the architect for the US Government 'Sentinel Initiative', a response to Magneto's terrorist attacks on Capitol Hill. Initially, the Sentinels patrolled Los Angeles and then New York City, destroying any human containing mutant genes. However, these attacks ceased after the X-Men rescued the President's daughter from the Brotherhood of Mutants. He discovered the Savage Land's location, and dispatched to destroy Magneto's paradise by order from the President of the United States. This proved to be a foolish move when Magneto easily reprogrammed the chromium- built machines to destroy humankind. After a subsequent Sentinel attack on Washington, D.C., the Sentinel Initiative was shut down. He has recently appeared in the Sentinels story arc of Ultimate X-Men, revealed as being employed by the Fenris twins to build the new Sentinels currently attacking mutants. This would suggest that the government no longer employs him, perhaps due to the failure of the Sentinel Initiative. Feeling horrified by all that he has done, he allows himself, during Angel's attempted saving, to drop into the heart of an explosion and is killed.Ultimate X-Men #87. Marvel Comics. Another iteration of the character is featured in Ultimate Spider-Man. He is shown to be the CEO of Trask Industries and was the employer of Edward Brock Sr. and Richard Parker while they worked on the Venom suit as a cure for cancer. However, he later tricked the two to sign a contract that made the suit his full property and then he was deliberately responsible for the plane crash that killed Edward, Richard and Mary Parker, by manipulating Edward to steal a piece of the unstable Venom suit and try it on board, so that the suit would remain in his possession, despite it being incomplete and very dangerous. Years later, Eddie Brock Jr. ends up stealing the Venom suit for himself and becomes Venom. Later, after one of his researchers, Adrian Toomes, witnesses Venom fighting Peter Parker, Trask hires Silver Sable and her Wild Pack to find and capture Venom. After they deliver him to Trask, he and Toomes begin to experiment on Venom, but they are suddenly interrupted by an attack of the Beetle on Trask's facility, which allows Venom to escape.Ultimate Spider-Man #128 (January 2009). Marvel Comics. In other media =Television= * Bolivar Trask appeared in the 1990s animated series, voiced by Brett Halsey. This version is the Sentinels' creator and co-conspired with Henry Peter Gyrich and Cameron Hodge against mutants. But when Master Mold endangers Robert Kelly's life, he ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy his creation but survived unlike his comic book counterpart. * Colonel Bolivar Trask appeared in X-Men Evolution, voiced by John Novak. This version is a former member of S.H.I.E.L.D., and a noted anthropologist and cyberneticist studying the process of genetic mutation. Trask concluded the mutants would one day replace humans as the dominant species on Earth if left unchecked. He decided to prevent this by designing an army of robotic guardians who would apprehend mutant kind. In the episode \\"Day of Reckoning\\" Pt. 1, he kidnapped Wolverine as a test subject for his Sentinel prototype. The Sentinel was able to defeat Wolverine. After his Sentinel prototype was destroyed and the X-Men were cleared, Trask was arrested and placed in prison. In the episode \\"Uprising,\\" Nick Fury was ordered by his superiors to release Trask from prison so that he can continue his Sentinel project under Nick Fury's supervision. This way, the world would be ready for Apocalypse's threat. * Bolivar Trask appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Phil LaMarr. In the episode \\"Thieves Gambit\\", he is shown as a scientist working for Senator Kelly alongside Dr. Sybil Zane on the Sentinel Program's creation. Though the building it was being developed in was destroyed in a fight with Wolverine and Gambit, Bolivar and Dr. Zane escaped. In the episode \\"Badlands\\", Trask ran a laboratory that Wolverine, Shadowcat and Forge infiltrated. When Wolverine ended up captured, Bolivar figured out about the mutant's adamantium skeleton, resulting in advanced-type Sentinels that the future X-Men encountered 20 years later. In the episode \\"Backlash\\", Trask had managed to create Master Mold to create the Sentinels. He was with Senator Kelly, Warren Worthington II and Dr. Zane when they watch the Sentinels fight the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. In the episode \\"Foresight\\", Trask ends up launching the Sentinels to Genosha under orders from Mystique (disguised as Senator Kelly) and later gets knocked out by Mystique. * Trask Industries is mentioned in the 2017 live-action series The Gifted as well as operating the Hound Program under Roderick Campbell and develop Sentinel Services. =Film= * Bolivar Trask was included in the first draft for the 2000 film X-Men, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, but had to be removed for the film to be greenlit by the studio. * A character with \\"Trask\\" as surname referred as \\"Secretary Trask\\" appears in the 2006 film X-Men: The Last Stand, played by Bill Duke.Hoare, James (May 14, 2014). \\"X-Men: Days Of Future Past director Bryan Singer talks X-Men continuity\\". SciFi Now. This version is the African-American head of the Department of Homeland Security who amicably works with Hank McCoy to monitor villainous mutants like Mystique. * Trask Industries is alluded in the mid- credits scene of the 2013 film The Wolverine. As Professor X and Magneto warn Wolverine of an upcoming threat to mutants, a television at an airport security checkpoint displays an ad for Trask Industries. Peter Dinklage as Bolivar Trask in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). * Bolivar Trask appears as the main antagonist in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past, portrayed by Peter Dinklage. Learning of mutants' existence from Charles Xavier's dissertation from Oxford University, he was provoked into harnessing mutant powers for his weapon-making agendas as well as creating the Sentinel program. He does not seem to have a personal hatred for mutants and views mutants as a means to bring about world peace by uniting humanity against a 'common enemy', leading some to view him as insane and callous. Trask's inhumane and fatal experiments on mutants, including some of the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, result in being a target by Mystique. In the original timeline, Mystique kills Trask in retaliation, resulting in both his martyrdom and a dystopian future where more advanced versions of Sentinels have pushed both mutants and humans to the brink of extinction. The future X-Men have the time- displaced Wolverine rally the younger versions of Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr to prevent Trask's assassination. The X-Men are able to spare Trask from his 'original' death but an ensuing fight as Lensherr tries to kill Mystique to ensure that Mystique cannot have another chance to kill Trask later, resulted in Lehnsherr, Mystique and Beast being witnessed fighting in public, prompting the approval of Trask's Sentinel program. At the subsequent unveiling, Trask is again targeted by Mystique again but the event gets attacked by Magneto having laced the prototype versions of Sentinels with metal to turn against their creators. Mystique stops Magneto and prepares to kill Trask and stops only when Xavier persuades Mystique via telepathic conversation. By doing this and sparing Trask, history is rewritten: Mystique's stopping of Magneto's attack and leaving without causing any kind of further harm becomes a convincing demonstration to the world that not all mutants are against humanity and the U.S. cancels Trask's Sentinel program. Afterwards, a newspaper article states that Trask had been arrested for attempting to sell his Sentinel designs to foreign countries (as he was trying to do before his 'original' death). A mid-credits scene in the Rogue Cut shows Trask incarcerated inside the cell that once held Lehnsherr underneath the Pentagon. =Video games= * The Ultimate Marvel version of Bolivar Trask appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man video game, voiced by John Billingsley. The game continues on from the events of the Ultimate Spider-Man comics, as Trask and Adrian Toomes attempt to re-create Venom suit. They hire Silver Sable's Wild Pack to capture Eddie, which they do after he is defeated by Spider-Man. Trask forces Eddie to test the suit for him by fighting Electro, whom he defeats him after Spider-Man's presence gives him an unusual amount of control of the suit. After informing Trask of this, he remembers that Richard Parker's DNA was used as the basis of the Venom suit, and concludes that Peter is Spider- Man and that getting some of his DNA should improve the suit. Trask then has the Wild Pack take Eddie to hunt Peter down, but he transforms into Venom and escapes. Later, Sable captures both Venom and Spider-Man and delivers them to Trask, but both break free, with Spider-Man being transformed into Carnage after he is injected with a makeshift sample of the Venom symbiote by Toomes. After Venom defeats Carnage and absorbs the symbiote from Peter's body, gaining complete control over the Venom suit, he leaves to exact revenge on Trask, but Spider-Man goes to warn him, leading Trask to attempt to escape via helicopter, which he doesn't know how to fly. After Spider-Man defeats Venom, Trask gives him some files revealing the truth about his and Eddie's fathers' death, before being arrested. He is later confronted in prison by Venom, who kills him off-screen. * Bolivar Trask is mentioned in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, in regards to his Sentinels and how they have been changed to help protect New York from Apocalypse's forces. * Bolivar Trask is briefly mentioned in X-Men: The Official Game, first when it is stated that he will be taking over supervision of Multiple Man, and later by Beast, who says that he helped William Stryker create the Sentinels and Master Mold with HYDRA's backing. * Bolivar Trask appears in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, voiced by Bumper Robinson. Depicted as African-American, this version is shown researching the mutant gene for Symstemized Cybernetics Lab/SCL (Sebastian Shaw's company) and playing a key role in the creation of the Sentinels. In the game's continuity, worklogs accessed by the player as they search his base reveal that Trask initially did not have anything against mutants and simply took part in the Sentinel project for the scientific value. However, after witnessing a violent incident which involved a mutant test subject, he came to see mutants as a menace, believing that humanity could only be protected if mutants were eliminated, describing them as freaks of nature. In the game's story, Trask's hate for mutants is furthered after Wolverine slashes his left hand off in order to use his handprint to gain access to an area of the SCL facility. Trask later appears in the game's epilogue, in a not so distant future where the Sentinels rule the Earth. He is shown to have replaced his lost arm with a cybernetic one, and captured Wolverine, although he escapes and kills his men, whilst Trask flees. * Trask Industries is alluded in The Amazing Spider-Man video game. A sign that reads \\"Trask Industries Sells the Suit\\" can be seen on the streets of Manhattan. =Non-fiction= Bolivar Trask's hatred of mutants is discussed in the non-fiction book From Krakow to Krypton: Jews and Comic Books.

A leucine zipper (or leucine scissors) is a common three-dimensional structural motif in proteins. They were first described by Landschulz and collaborators in 1988 when they found that an enhancer binding protein had a very characteristic 30-amino acid segment and the display of these amino acid sequences on an idealized alpha helix revealed a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The polypeptide segments containing these periodic arrays of leucine residues were proposed to exist in an alpha-helical conformation and the leucine side chains from one alpha helix interdigitate with those from the alpha helix of a second polypeptide, facilitating dimerization. Leucine zippers are a dimerization motif of the bZIP (Basic-region leucine zipper) class of eukaryotic transcription factors. The bZIP domain is 60 to 80 amino acids in length with a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The localization of the leucines are critical for the DNA binding to the proteins. Leucine zippers are present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic regulatory proteins, but are mainly a feature of eukaryotes. They can also be annotated simply as ZIPs, and ZIP- like motifs have been found in proteins other than transcription factors and are thought to be one of the general protein modules for protein‚Äìprotein interactions. Sequence and structure Another DNA binding domain, the Helix-loop-helix (HLH) dimer, is shown bound to DNA fragment ‚Äî each alpha helix represents a monomer. Leucine zipper is created by the dimerization of two specific alpha helix monomers bound to DNA. The leucine zipper is formed by amphipathic interaction between two ZIP domains. The ZIP domain is found in the alpha-helix of each monomer, and contains leucines, or leucine-like amino acids. These amino acids are spaced out in each region's polypeptide sequence in such a way that when the sequence is coiled in a 3D alpha-helix, the leucine residues line up on the same side of the helix. This region of the alpha-helix- containing the leucines which line up- is called a ZIP domain, and leucines from each ZIP domain can weakly interact with leucines from other ZIP domains, reversibly holding their alpha-helices together (dimerization). When these alpha helices dimerize, the zipper is formed. The hydrophobic side of the helix forms a dimer with itself or another similar helix, burying the non-polar amino acids away from the solvent. The hydrophilic side of the helix interacts with the water in the solvent. Leucine zipper motifs are considered a subtype of coiled coils, which are built by two or more alpha helices that are wound around each other to form a supercoil. Coiled coils contain 3- and 4-residue repeats whose hydrophobicity pattern and residue composition is compatible with the structure of amphipathic alpha-helices. The alternating three- and four-residue sequence elements constitute heptad repeats in which the amino acids are designated from a‚Äô to g‚Äô. While residues in positions a and d are generally hydrophobic and form a zigzag pattern of knobs and holes that interlock with a similar pattern on another strand to form a tight- fitting hydrophobic core, residues in positions e and g are charged residues contributing to the electrostatic interaction. In the case of leucine zippers, leucines are predominant at the d position of the heptad repeat. These residues pack against each other every second turn of the alpha-helices, and the hydrophobic region between two helices is completed by residues at the a positions, which are also frequently hydrophobic. They are referred to as coiled coils unless they are proven to be important for protein function. If that is the case, then they are annotated in the ‚Äúdomain‚Äù subsection, which would be the bZIP domain. Two different types of such a-helices can pair up to form a heterodimeric leucine zipper. With apolar amino acid residues at either the e or g position, a heterotetramer consisting of 2 different leucine zippers can be generated in-vitro, which implies that the overall hydrophobicity of the interaction surface and van der vaals interaction may alter the organization of coiled coils and play a role in the formation of leucine zipper heterodimer.  Specific binding between bZIP proteins and DNA  The bZIP interacts with the DNA via basic, amine residues (see basic amino acids in (provided table (sort by pH)) of certain amino acids in the \\"basic\\" domain, such as lysines and arginines. These basic residues interact in the major groove of the DNA, forming sequence-specific interactions. The mechanism of transcriptional regulation by bZIP proteins has been studied in detail. Most bZIP proteins show high binding affinity for the ACGT motifs, which include CACGTG (G box), GACGTC (C box), TACGTA (A box), AACGTT (T box), and a GCN4 motif, namely TGA(G/C)TCA. The bZIP heterodimers exist in a variety of eukaryotes and are more common in organisms with higher evolution complexity. Heterodimeric bZIP proteins differ from homodimeric bZIP and from each other in protein-protein interaction affinity. These heterodimers exhibit complex DNA binding specificity. When combined with a different partner, most of the bZIP pairs bind to DNA sequences that each individual partner prefers. In some cases, dimerization of different bZIP partners can change the DNA sequence that the pair targets in a manner that could not have been predicted based on the preferences of each partner alone. This suggests that, as heterodimers, bZIP transcription factors are able to change their preferences for which location they target in the DNA. The ability of bZIP domain forming dimers with different partners greatly expands the locations on the genome to which bZIP transcription factors can bind and from which they can regulate gene expression. A small number of bZIP factors such as OsOBF1 can also recognize palindromic sequences. However, the others, including LIP19, OsZIP-2a, and OsZIP-2b, do not bind to DNA sequences. Instead, these bZIP proteins form heterodimers with other bZIPs to regulate transcriptional activities. Biology Leucine zipper regulatory proteins include c-fos and c-jun (the AP1 transcription factor), important regulators of normal development, as well as myc family members including myc, max, and mxd1. If they are overproduced or mutated in a vital area, they may cause cancer. = BZIP containing transcription factors regulate various biological processes = The bZIP- containing Nuclear factor interleukin 3 regulated protein (NFIL3) is a transcription repressor which play multiple roles in regulating various biological processes. The NFIL3 protein has 462 amino acids including a b-ZIP domain . The N-terminal portion of the domain contains the basic motif, which directly binds to DNA. The C-terminal portion of the b-ZIP domain contains an amphipathic leucine zipper region, which mediates homo- and hetero- dimerization. The expression of the Nfil3 gene changes along with the circadian cycle and the NFIL3, as a repression factor, regulates circadian rhythm. NFIL3 competes with the transcription activator D site albumin promoter binding protein (DBP) in binding with the D box elements in the DNA, which is one of the circadian transcription factor consensus sites. DBP is another bZIP protein and shows an opposite portfolio of expression level to that of NFIL3. When NFIL3 level is high, genes under control of the D box elements will be repressed. Overexpression of Nfil3 shortens the circadian cycle. NFIL3 influences cell survival and involves in oncogenesis. NFIL3 is shown to be a survival factor that hinders apoptotic cell death in numerous cell types and leads to oncogenesis. High expression level of NFIL3 is shown associate with breast cancer. In cancer cells, NFIL3 associates with Histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) and represses pro-apoptotic genes such as Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10 (TRAIL) and TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS) to prevent apoptosis. NFIL3 can also hinder apoptosis in cancer cells by binding to DNA and block the access of transcription factor Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) to cell death genes, which undermines cell cycle and promotes oncogenesis. In colon cancer, NFIL3 may also block the recruitment of another type of transcription factors, Proline Acid Rich (PAR) proteins. NFIL3 functions as a repressor to neuron regeneration associated genes. Nfil3 is expressed in neuron cells with regeneration potential to keep cell growth under control. Expression of Nfil3 is induced by phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), and the NFIL3 protein in turn competes for binding sites shared with CREB and CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP), which downregulates target genes of CREB and CEBP to counteract the effect of cAMP signaling. Meanwhile, NFIL3 binds to its own promoter to repress its own expression, creating a negative feedback regulation of neuron regeneration. NFIL3 is also found to be important in immunology. It is required for natural killer cells and vital for the development and function of other immune cells, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory response in helper T cells, production of IgE from B cells, maturation of CD8a dendritic cells and priming of CD8+ T cells.

They perform land and underwater location, identification, render-safe, and recovery (or disposal) of foreign and domestic ordnance. They conduct demolition of hazardous munitions, pyrotechnics, and retrograde explosives using detonation and burning techniques. They forward deploy and fully integrate with the various Combatant Commanders, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and various warfare units within the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Army. They are also called upon to support military and civilian law enforcement agencies, as well as the Secret Service. EOD Technicians' missions take them to all environments, and every climate, in every part of the world. They have many assets available to arrive to their mission, from open- and closed-circuit scuba and surface supplied diving rigs, to parachute insertion from fixed-wing aircraft and fast-rope, abseil, and Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction (SPIE) from rotary aircraft, to small boats and tracked vehicles. History Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams trace their history back to the first group of volunteers selected to work with the famed British UXO teams, following the initial German Blitzkrieg attacks in early 1940. In June 1941, these veterans returned to form the first class in what was originally named the Mine Recovery School. Officers and enlisted personnel entered the eleven-week school, qualifying as Mine Recovery Personnel/Second Class Divers. Between June 1941 and October 1945, nineteen classes graduated and deployed throughout the Pacific and Mediterranean theaters. Divided into Mobile Explosive Investigative Units (MEIU) they were instrumental in the clearance of explosive hazards both on land and at sea. The Korean War saw a return to action on various minesweepers ensuring the continual clearance of shipping hazards. Additionally, the now renamed Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Units took part in inland intelligence operations and interacted with ground-based units in Inchon, Wonson and throughout the United Nations Theater of operations. The Vietnam War saw an increase in overall participation by EOD units. Units from EOD Group Pacific, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii deployed throughout the region. EODGRUPAC was composed of Mobile Unit, Shipboard Unit and Training and Evaluation Unit personnel. Deployed teams onboard ships at sea were composed of one officer and two enlisted men. Teams in-country were larger and were based from the Mekong Delta (RIVFLOT 1) to DaNang. With an overall emphasis in sea and riverine mine clearance operations, these teams ensured the continued safety for shipping and maritime operations. Since the close of the Vietnam War, the changing world situation and increased operational tasking have prompted the expansion of EOD units in number, size and capabilities. Their record in recent history includes the Gulf War where EOD Technicians cleared in excess of 500 naval mines. EOD was the critical element in eliminating unexploded ordnance from the after two Exocet anti-ship missiles fired from an Iraqi aircraft hit her. EOD developed render safe procedures on-site to prevent a catastrophe. During joint operations in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, EOD provided safety and operational continuity by eliminating booby traps, weapons caches, and performing mine clearance operations. EOD units are presently serving in Afghanistan and Iraq where they are supporting the global war against terrorism, destroying tons of post war ordnance and reducing the threat imposed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) that have plagued both countries. Forward deployed and fully integrated within the various Special Operations units within the U.S. Navy and Army, the present day EOD technician has changed greatly from that first Mine Recovery class of 1941. But one thing that has never changed is the level of professionalism and dedication that has been the cornerstone of the program. Training EOD training pipeline The EOD training pipeline starts with three weeks of preparatory training at Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois. The candidate will work on swim stroke development, long range swims and physical conditioning. EOD candidates will then attend an additional 51 weeks of rigorous training. Their training starts with nine weeks of dive school held at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC) in Panama City, Florida. Besides learning how to dive, candidates learn about the various kinds of equipment and dive physics. After successful completion of dive school, candidates transfer to Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal School at Eglin Air Force Base in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. This training is broken down into specific types of ordnance: ; Demolition Division : Includes how to set up various explosive firing trains ; Tools & Methods Division : Teaches you the various tools and methods of EOD work ; Core Division : Teaches basic fundamentals of EOD work ; Ground Ordnance Division : Focuses on projected munitions and grenades ; Air Ordnance Division : Focuses on bombs and missiles ; Improvised Explosive Device : Includes \\"homemade bombs‚Äù ; Bio/Chem Division : Includes lessons on various biological and chemical agents ; Nuclear Ordnance Division : Covers basic nuclear physics and radiation monitoring and decontamination procedures ;Underwater Ordnance Division : Emphasizes torpedoes and other underwater explosives as well as underwater search techniques Every section teaches how to render-safe or defuse ordnance. Member of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Five jumps from a CH-46 using a MC1-1C parachute Upon completion of basic EOD training, some graduates will attend the three-week Basic Airborne Course at Fort Benning, Georgia where candidates qualify as a basic parachutist. After Jump School, training continues at Gulfport, Mississippi, for an additional four weeks, consisting of weapons training in the use of the 9mm handgun and the M-4 carbine as well as combat first aid. The final phase of EOD training is three weeks of EOD Tactical Training at the Naval Amphibious Base in San Diego. This will consist of helicopter insertion (fast-rope, rappel, cast and SPIE), small arms/weapons training, small unit tactics (weapons, self-defense, land navigation, and patrolling), and tactical communications (satellite and high frequency). Upon completion of the EOD training, graduates are assigned to EOD Mobile Units where they gain advanced on-the-job training and experience as members of Combat Expeditionary Support (CES) platoons/companies, Carrier and Expeditionary Strike Group platoons, Naval Special Warfare and SOF Companies, and Marine Mammal Companies. =Officer training= Officer training for the EOD career field (119x / 114x) differs slightly. Their pipeline is as follows: * EOD Junior Officer Course (7 days, Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center) ‚Äì This course trains junior officers in EOD group, mobile unit, and detachment/small unit organization to include organizational relationships with detachments/small units, small group dynamics, CPO/OIC relationships, ethics, and EOD case studies. * Diver Training (60 days, Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center) ‚Äì Designed to provide qualified non-diving personnel with the basic training necessary to safely and effectively perform as a dive team member/diver in SCUBA and MK-16 UBA in accordance with the U.S. Navy Diving Manual. * EOD School (320 days, Naval School Explosive Ordnance Disposal) (see enlisted training) * Basic Airborne (23 days, Fort Benning) (see enlisted training) * Expeditionary Combat Skills (27 days, Center for Security Forces) * EOD Tactical Training (21 days, EOD Training and Evaluation Unit ONE, San Diego) (See enlisted training) * EOD Platoon Leader Course (12 days) Advanced training opportunities include foreign language, Advanced Improvised Explosive Device Disposal, and Department of Energy training. Advanced equipment EOD employs a variety of tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to accomplish the mission. Robots are used to perform remote procedures on unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices. Efforts to maintain the latest technology are accomplished with the assistance and the DoE and various civilian organizations. Johns Hopkins University maintains the Advanced Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotic System (AEODRS) program. The primary goal of AEODRS is to develop a common architecture for a family of unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) systems to enable unprecedented levels of interoperability. AEODRS is a Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (JSEOD) program, executed through the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) via the Navy Program Management Office for Explosive Ordnance Disposal/Counter Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (PMS-408).

Symptoms include pain in the front of the knee. Typically the pain and tenderness is at the lower part of the kneecap, though the upper part may also be affected. Generally there is not pain when the person is at rest. Complications may include patellar tendon rupture. Risk factors include being involved in athletics and being overweight. It is particularly common in athletes who are involved in jumping sports such as basketball and volleyball. The underlying mechanism involves small tears in the tendon connecting the kneecap with the shinbone. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and examination. Other conditions that can appear similar include infrapatellar bursitis, chondromalacia patella and patellofemoral syndrome. Treatment often involves resting the knee and physical therapy. Evidence for treatments, including rest, however is poor. Recovery can take a year. It is relatively common with about 14% of athletes currently affected. Males are more commonly affected than females. The term \\"jumper's knee\\" was coined in 1973. Signs and symptoms People report anterior knee pain, often with an aching quality. The symptom onset is insidious. Rarely is a discrete injury described. Usually, the problem is below the kneecap but it may also be above. Jumper's knee can be classified into 1 of 4 stages, as follows: Stage 1 ‚Äì Pain only after activity, without functional impairment Stage 2 ‚Äì Pain during and after activity, although the person is still able to perform satisfactorily in his or her sport Stage 3 ‚Äì Prolonged pain during and after activity, with increasing difficulty in performing at a satisfactory level Stage 4 ‚Äì Complete tendon tear requiring surgical repair It begins as inflammation in the patellar tendon where it attaches to the patella and may progress by tearing or degenerating the tendon. People present with an ache over the patella tendon. Most people are between 10 and 16 years old. Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal edema (increased T2 signal intensity) in the proximal aspect of the patellar tendon. Causes It is an overuse injury from repetitive overloading of the extensor mechanism of the knee. The microtears exceed the body's healing mechanism unless the activity is stopped. Among the risk factors for patellar tendonitis are low ankle dorsiflexion, weak gluteal muscles, and muscle tightness, particularly in the calves, quadriceps muscle, and hamstrings. It may be associated with stiff ankle movement and ankle sprains. Diagnosis Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and a physical examination. Ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging may help clarify how severe the problem is. Treatment Evidence for treatment is poor. In the early stages rest, ice, compression, and elevation may be tried. Tentative evidence supports exercises involving eccentric muscle contractions of the quadriceps on a decline board. Specific exercises and stretches to strengthen the muscles and tendons may be recommended, eg. cycling or swimming. Use of a strap for jumper's knee and suspension inlays for shoes may also reduce the problems. Corticosteroid injections and NSAIDs are not generally recommended. =Procedures= Dry needling, sclerosing injections, platelet-rich plasma, extracorporeal shock wave treatment, and heat therapy have been tried. =Surgery= Surgery may be tried if other measures fail. This may involve removal of myxoid degeneration in the tendon. This is reserved for people with severe pain for 6‚Äì12 months despite conservative measures. Novel treatment modalities targeting the abnormal blood vessel growth which occurs in the condition are currently being investigated. Knee operations in most cases have no better effects than exercise programs. Epidemiology It is relatively common with about 14% of athletes currently affected. Males are more commonly affected than females.

He presented weekend radio shows called \\"Weekends with Warren\\" on ABC Local Radio stations across Queensland, Australia, broadcasting from the studios of 612 ABC Brisbane. Boland's radio broadcasts could be heard from 9am-midday (10am-midday outside Brisbane) on Saturdays and from 10am-midday on Sundays. Warren's contract at 612ABC was not renewed at the end of 2013 and he was replaced in the lineup. Rugby league career A halfback in high school, Boland recalled being rejected due to his small stature. \\"After I had gone to try out for the school side in Year 11, I was told to go away and grow some more,\\" he said. Boland won an under-23s premiership with St George before travelling overseas in 1975. Upon his return to Australia, he signed for the Balmain Tigers and was a member of the Tigers' Amco Cup-winning side in 1976. From 1979, he played five seasons with the Western Suburbs Magpies. He often captained the side from his position of , including in the 1980 semi-final campaign. A broken leg suffered in the 1981 pre-season saw some questioning whether his career was over, but he returned to first grade in late July. He was again captaining the side in the 1982 semi-finals appearance, before retiring in 1983 at the relatively young age of 28. He was later named as winger and captain of Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Eighties. Warren Boland was considered an anomaly in the tough Western Suburbs teams of his time which had a strong reputation as being working class \\"battlers\\" and included such players as Tommy Raudonikis, Les Boyd and John \\"Dallas\\" Donnelly. He was described as, \\"well-educated, articulate, ambitious, and deeply concerned with social issues.\\" An arts graduate of Macquarie University, Boland hosted a \\"social issues\\" radio show on 2SM during his time as a player. Media During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Warren Boland commentated on the ABC-TV's Saturday afternoon New South Wales Rugby League / Australian Rugby League matches, generally alongside co-caller David Morrow until becoming chief caller in 1990 with Morrow's move to Channel 10. He also commentated with fellow ex-players David Wright, John Peard and Arthur Beetson, as well as Debbie Spillane. Boland also covered the 1990 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France for the ABC, calling the two tests the Australian Kangaroos played against France on the French leg of the tour.1990 Kangaroo Tour Highlights (France Leg) Following this, he worked for Fox Sports in 1997-98. During the football season these days, he co-hosts the ABC-TV coverage of Queensland Cup rugby league matches. These telecasts are broadcast within Queensland on ABC-TV and across Australia on both Fox Sports and digital channel ABC2 (free-to-air channel 21, pay TV channel 126). In addition to rugby league, Boland has also commentated on a range of other sports, including cricket, golf, and numerous Olympic Games, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games events for the ABC and the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union[ABU]. On 29 April 2010, Warren was named the inaugural 612 ABC Brisbane Employee of the Week. Well known for his intelligent sense of humour, Boland played \\"Pete the French Polisher\\" on the ABC-TV show Club Buggery in the mid-1990s. Boland is also famous for his trademark moustache.

It is the teaching hospital for the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine.  History  Plans had been in place since the founding of the school for a medical center, and space was set aside on campus.McCulloch. S:\\"Instant University\\",page 99. Academic Press,1993 This would model the hospital campuses at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of California, San Diego. The medical school wasn't originally planned to begin until the university had time to establish itself and stabilize sources of funding. Political divisions between the American Medical Association and Californian osteopaths brought the medical school to UCI early.McCulloch. S:\\"Instant University\\",page 96. Academic Press,1993 The California College of Medicine was the oldest continuously operating medical college in the Southwest United States. Starting in 1896 as the Pacific College of Osteopathy, it was renamed as the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons. Pressure by the AMA brought an end to its tenure in the osteopathic discipline, and the newly renamed California College of Medicine merged with the UC system in 1965, after efforts to keep it in LA or move to Long Beach broke down.McCulloch. S:\\"Instant University\\",page 94. Academic Press,1993 Dean of Medicine Stanley van den Noort was adamant about opening a teaching hospital on campus, placing him in political opposition to Governor Jerry Brown. Brown managed to block the release of funds earmarked for the hospital's construction and then divert them toward the founding of UCSF's dental school. He then vetoed a compromise for UCI to take care of Orange County Medical Center's patients in exchange for a 200-bed hospital. Under pressure from Brown the UC purchased the OCMC in 1976 from the county who no longer wished to maintain the aging and problematic facilities. This acquisition effectively halted the push for an on-campus hospital.McCulloch. S:\\"Instant University\\",page 200. Academic Press,1993 An attempt to establish a hospital through private venture ended with the death of the entire planning committee in a plane crash. Those opposed successfully lobbied the state to build the Irvine Medical Center against the school's wishes, making a hospital at UCI impractical due to the proximity. The university has since greatly expanded the facility and services of the medical center. Since then, the medical center has grown in size and reputation. It is building a new hospital, to be completed in early 2009, and is home to the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute-designated center for cancer treatment and research. Other onsite buildings include the Neuropsychiatric Center, the UCI Health Sciences Laboratories building and clinical outpatient pavilions on the medical center site, as well as community family health centers in Irvine, Santa Ana, Westminster and Anaheim. Just prior to UCI's acquisition in 1976, the medical center had about 2,100 employees. Today, UC Irvine Medical Center has more than 3,500 employees. In 2000 the medical centre began publishing the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine. Since 2001, the U.S. News and World Report has listed UC Irvine Health programs in urology, gynecology, geriatrics, cancer, digestive disorders, nephrology, orthopedics, and ear, nose & throat among the top 50 nationwide. In 2016, two UC Irvine Health specialties were included among the top 50 nationally: 40th for orthopedics and 41st for ear, nose and throat. It has the county‚Äôs only Level I trauma center and its sole multiple-organ transplant center, and is the only hospital in the area offering a number of specialized surgeries. The medical center has been home to a number of firsts‚Äîincluding the first heart transplant in Orange County, the first implant on the West Coast of an insulin pump in a patient with diabetes, and a number of research breakthroughs involving therapy for cancer and other diseases. = Controversies = In 1995, three doctors at the UCI Center for Reproductive Health were accused of taking eggs from a woman without her consent and transferring them to another woman, who delivered a baby. Investigators later found that these doctors had stolen eggs from 100 women. Although the misuse of eggs was not illegal at the time, the doctors involved were indicted for mail fraud and tax evasion, and two fled the country. In 2003, UCI hired Jagat Narula and Mani Vannan as the chief and division chief of cardiology. Neither was board certified in internal medicine nor cardiology, and neither had a California medical license. In 2003, Dr. Glenn Provost presented a 13-signature petition outlining anesthesia safety problems. He stated that soon after complaining about a supervisor forcing him \\"to take patients to the operating room without consent, chart, or preoperative check-in by the operating room nurse ... in an attempt to cut costs,\\" he was fired and blackballed. Persons close to the case feel that there was a vendetta against Dr. Provost by Cynthia Anderson, the prior chair. In 2005, it came to light that 32 patients had died while waiting for liver transplants at UCI. Some livers were available, but, for two years, UCI did not have a full-time surgeon to implant them, in contravention of federal regulations. UCI's designated surgeon was actually on staff at UC San Diego, 70 miles away. A patient at UCI, Elodie Irvine, filed a lawsuit. Ms. Irvine, who had liver and kidney disease, had 95 organs offered for transplant by the United Network for Organ Sharing during her stay at UCI. The hospital allegedly told the patient that they were waiting for organs, when in fact they rejected every organ offered to them. Only one UCI physician advised her to look elsewhere for a transplant. Over the years, there have been several cases of sexual harassment allegations against the employees of UC Irvine Medical Center. In June 1994, Christina Grudzinski, a second-year resident, accused her attending physician and her chief resident of sexual harassment. She later sued the university after the situation was unresolved and claimed the university faculty retaliated against her by firing her. She lost the court proceedings to the university in 2002 after the trial court and all of the higher courts on appeal ruled her lawsuit was \\"frivolous\\" and ordered her to pay $1.1 million back to the university in court fees. Carlin Motley, a fundraiser for the hospital, filed a lawsuit in 2018 claiming she was not protected from a university volunteer who stalked and sexually harassed her for more than one year prior. The lawsuit remains ongoing.  Capabilities  University of California, Irvine Medical Center is the only university hospital in Orange County with more than 400 specialty and primary care physicians. The medical center offers a full scope of acute- and general-care services including cancer care, digestive diseases, heart health neurology, neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, primary care, surgery, and women's health. It is the only hospital in Orange County recognized in U.S. News & World Report‚Äôs annual listing of \\"America's Best Hospitals\\" and first to receive Magnet Designation for nursing excellence. The medical center has also been named one of the nation‚Äôs top hospitals for quality and safety by the Leapfrog Group. Located in the City of Orange, 13 miles from the UCI campus, UC Irvine Medical Center has 411 licensed beds and is the principal clinical facility for the teaching and research programs of the UC Irvine School of Medicine. The seven-story UC Irvine Douglas Hospital was completed in late 2011. Additionally, there are 45 licensed beds in their Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 19 high-tech operating rooms including two hybrid cardiac care operating rooms, and eight beds in the Burn Intensive Care Unit. The University Children‚Äôs Hospital at UC Irvine Medical Center is devoted to the care of children from before birth through adolescence. Perinatologists at UC Irvine Medical Center are available for the expert management of high-risk pregnancies and critically ill newborns are cared for in the county‚Äôs most sophisticated neonatal unit. The medical center houses a 24-hour emergency department and is designated as Orange County‚Äôs only Level I Trauma Center ‚àí the most comprehensive for the treatment of life-threatening injuries. UC Irvine Medical Center is also home to the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, the only facility in Orange County designated as a comprehensive cancer center by the National Cancer Institute. It offers patients a full range of cancer therapies and research programs, including laser and radiation therapy, endoscopic ultrasound, and immunotherapy.  UC Irvine Douglas Hospital  On February 7, 2005, construction begun on a $375 million replacement central hospital adjacent to the existing UCI Medical Center facility. In addition to expanding patient services (with 191 new rooms, 15 state-of-the-art operating rooms, and three procedure rooms), the new hospital provides the UCI School of Medicine with a modern facility for conducting the latest medical research and training future and practicing physicians. It also employs architecture that offers private patient rooms, natural light for daytime illumination, and carefully designed labs and offices. The new seven- story facility was designed by HOK architects, TMAD Engineers, Nabih Youssef & Associates Structural Engineers, and the project contractor was Hensel Phelps Construction Company. In early 2009, UC Irvine opened the new UC Irvine Douglas Hospital, renamed after a $21 million posthumous gift from the estate of M.A. Douglas.  UC Irvine Health Sciences  The UCI Medical Center is part of the UC Irvine Health Sciences system, which is composed of a number of patient care locations that serve Orange County.

In September 1998, the newspaper France Soir published statements made to the police. Two convicted riders, Armin Meier and Christophe Moreau, said that Bassons was the only rider on the team not taking drugs. Jean-Luc Gatellier said in L'√âquipe: :It's true he's not one of them and he hasn't come out of the same mould. It's true that he refused to 'load the cannon' (the pretty expression used by those who take EPO) these past years, it's true that Christophe Bassons doesn't belong to the family of cheats and the corrupted.L'√âquipe, 17 July 1999 Moreau's and Meier's court statement brought attention to a rider who had never acquired it through his racing. He wrote in V√©lo, a French monthly, that riders who spoke out against quarterly medical checks imposed by the sports ministry after the Festina trial were hypocrites. He said: \\"That makes me laugh when I hear they're asking for changes to the tests. The truth, however, is that they are obliged to change their behaviour. They talk about 'two-speed cycling'A belief that medical checks on only French riders would stop their taking drugs but leave those of other nations to continue. But me, for three years, I've been the second speed. They have ruined three years of my life as a racer and I never said anything.\\"V√©lo, France, June 1999 In 1998 he turned down a 270,000 franc-per-month raise (more than 10 times what he was earning at the time) offered to him if he would use Erythropoietin (EPO).Bassons: ‚ÄòPeople Now See I Wasn‚Äôt Lying‚Äô , James Startt, Bicycling.com, October 15th, 2012 His stance against doping led other riders, most notably Lance Armstrong, to harass him for breaking the longstanding code of silence about doping in the sport.  1999 Tour  The interest that the Festina trial brought to him led to an invitation to write a column during the 1999 Tour de France for Le Parisien, a newspaper in the same corporate group as the Tour de France itself. Bassons wanted to write about the \\"suspicious\\" speeds he was seeing; the average speed at the 1999 Tour was ; no Tour had ever been run faster than . As he later told Bicycling, \\"The 1999 Tour was supposed to be the \\"Tour of Renewal,\\" but I was certain that doping had not disappeared.\\" He was not the only rider concerned about how fast the 1999 Tour was going; fellow Frenchman Jean-Cyril Robin who rode for US Postal in 1997-98, told Bassons at one point, \\"This has got to stop! We can't go on racing like this!\\" Ian Austen wrote in Procycling: :On the whole his columns were largely innocuous if entertaining looks at life in the peloton. If anything, he sometimes went out of his way to dispel doping rumours. After the stage into Blois, which passed at record average speed, Bassons warned readers: 'Don't get any ideas about the record speed. With a wind like we had, it's normal to ride this fast.' But two columns stuck out. After Lance Armstrong showed that not only had he recovered from cancer, he'd risen to the top of the pack, Bassons wrote that his performances had 'shocked' the peloton. Stage 10 occurred on July 14 and was from Sestrieres to Alpe d'Huez. Nobody had been talking to him. The entire peloton planned to ride slow for the first 100 km without telling him. Bassons only heard about this because a mechanic from his team told him. Bassons decided he was \\"fed up\\" and decided to ride ahead of the others (\\"attacked from the start\\"). As they came to a flat spot, \\"all of the teams rode together to close me down\\". As the teams rode by him, they stared at him. > \\" . . . and then Lance Armstrong reached me. He grabbed my by the shoulder, > because he knew that everyone would be watching, and he knew that at that > moment, he could show everyone that he was the boss. He stopped me, and he > said what I was saying wasn't true, what I was saying was bad for cycling, > that I musn't say it, that I had no right to be a professional cyclist, that > I should quit cycling, that I should quit the tour, and finished by saying > [*beep*] you. . . . I was depressed for 6 months. I was crying all of the > time. I was in a really bad way.\\" - Bassons, from BBC Radio 5, 2012 10 15 Bassons said Armstrong also asked him why he was speaking out; \\"I told him that I'm thinking of the next generation of riders. Then he said 'Why don't you leave, then?'\\" Armstrong confirmed the story. On the main evening news on TF1, a French national television station, Armstrong said: \\"His accusations aren't good for cycling, for his team, for me, for anybody. If he thinks cycling works like that, he's wrong and he would be better off going home.\\"Cited, L'√âquipe, 17 July 1999(L'Equipe 17 July 1999, cited Sport & Vie n¬∞6 de Sept/Oct 1999) Bassons was shunned by other riders. Giving a television interview at St-√âtienne (after Stage 11), he said, a passing rider in his own team said: \\"Watch what you say!\\"Procycling, undated cutting Bassons said: \\"I started feeling isolated. In the middle of 170 riders, that's a tough way to live.\\" Race director Jean-Marie Leblanc chastised Bassons for speaking as if \\"he is the only rider who is beyond reproach.\\" Officials with his own team joined in on the condemnation, calling him a coward who only spoke to burnish his own image. Riders shunned him or at best nodded. He cracked, saying he had not wanted to leave the race but his nerves could not stand it anymore. He said: :The [team doctor] comforted me. We often talk together about the problem of doping and we share the same ideas. I confided in him and I whined [j'ai chial√©]. I got to sleep but a bit after midnight I could no longer sleep because of my worries. I went into the corridor, I phoned my coach, Antoine Vayer, and Pascale, my wife. At 5.30am I had my breakfast and I packed my case. I crossed with MarcMarc Madiot, manager of Bassons' team, La Fran√ßaise des Jeux, who Bassons said had warned him against talking of doping and he said I was letting down the team. He said a rider could leave the race if he cracked physically but he couldn't accept that one can crack mentally. I said goodbye to everyone but one rider didn't look at me and refused to shake my hand. That hurt. The reporter Jean-Michel Rouet wrote: :Sometimes he was congratulated on his courage, as Daniel Baal, the president of the FFCF√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Cyclisme, the national governing body at the start at Sestrieres. But more often, others pointed at him [on le montrait du doigt], looked elsewhere, if they didn't just insult him. He has a few friends and a heap of enemies. His solitude was the living proof that nothing fundamental has changed in the morals of the milieu. Christophe Bassons died at the stake [est mort au bucher], burned by his passion. On official communiqu√©s, he left two words: non partant.Did not start. The peloton had already forgotten rider number 152.L'√âquipe, 17 July 2009 The sports minister, Marie-George Buffet, said: \\"What a strange role reversal. Rather than fighting against doping, they're fighting its opponent.\\" She wrote to him to sympathise, saying that it was time someone spoke out.Lib√©ration, France, 26 July 1999 Bassons' colleagues in the team refused to share their prizes with him. Normally teams pool their winnings and share them out by the number of days a rider has survived the race. One rider, Xavier Jan, said: \\"Christophe Bassons rode only for himself and didn't at any time work for the overall good of the team.\\" It had nothing to do with his comments about doping, he said.Procycling, UK, 2000 Thierry Bourguignon, part of another team but earlier a member with Bassons of Force Sud, confirmed: \\"I was the only one to talk to Bassons... He doesn't listen to anyone. Bassons is an individualist. Even in a race he doesn't easily lend a hand. He rides for himself.\\"L'√âquipe, 19 July 1999  Cycling after 1999  Bassons raced again, riding in Germany and Belgium. He said: \\"I felt a lot of tension. Some didn't talk to me. Others pretended nothing had happened, which is worse. Some say it's just youthful folly, but I feel more adult than them. I'm not the only clean rider but there aren't many who can say 'I don't take drugs'. For most riders, their health is the last of their concerns.\\"Procycling, UK, August 1999 He moved to a smaller team, Jean Delatour, but the mistreatment continued. In 2001 at Four Days of Dunkirk, he later told Bicycling, \\"several guys tried to ride me into the ditch . . . it got dangerous, and I realized that it wasn't worth continuing\\". He ended his professional road racing career. In her book about the Armstrong doping scandal, Cycle of Lies, Juliet Macur wrote that Bassons' mistreatment was a sign of the power Armstrong had over international cycling at the time. On October 20, 2012, he was suspended for one year by the French Cycling Federation (FFC) for having missed an antidoping test during the 2012 French national mountain bike championships. He had quit the race partway through, and by the time he heard he was one of the riders chosen for testing, it was too late to get back to the race site for the test. Christophe Bassons suspenduBassons handed one-year suspension, Cycling News, October 20, 2012 His suspension was reduced to one month on appeal. Bassons took the FFC to court and they found in his favour ruling that the governing body owed him compensation. The FFC appealed but the court did not find in their favour and they had to pay Bassons ‚Ç¨31,691 (¬£28,440/$36,270) in compensation. In 2011/2012, after investigations into past doping in cycling, especially the 2012 USADA report on Armstrong's US Postal Service team, some media re-told Bassons' story. In one interview for the BBC, Tyler Hamilton publicly apologized for being part of the peloton that shunned him, saying that he (Tyler) was \\"100% wrong\\" not to talk to Bassons. Bassons said \\"that's life, it's nothing. I don't begrudge Hamilton. I understand.\\"Peddlers - Cycling's Dirty Truth, 54:00, Mark Chapman, including interviews with Tyler Hamilton, Bassons, and others.

A steam shower is essentially a steam room that offers the typical features of a bathroom shower. Steam showers are generally found in self-contained enclosures that prevent the water vapour from escaping into the rest of the room, avoiding damage to drywall, paint, or wallpaper. Steam showers combine the functionality of a standard steam room with many additional features including a shower, FM radio and hydrotherapy. Steam showers are available in a variety of materials, including tile, acrylic, fiberglass, glass, stone, and wood. History Steam showers have evolved from the steambath which is thought to have been invented during the height of the Roman Empire. Ancient Roman baths served many community and social functions within Roman society. These Roman baths were supplied by natural hot springs from beneath the ground. Features A steam shower could be a regular shower with the added steam feature that is powered by a steam generator. In addition to plain steam, modern steam showers provide additional features such as foot massagers, ceiling rain showers, television, radios, telephones, audio input from an MP3 or CD player, chromatherapy or aromatherapy. A steam shower can use solar thermal technology and lessen the electricity bill drastically by heating the water with the sun. Health effects Over the years, steam has been utilized for a variety of different health purposes. The way people generate their steam has changed and steam showers can deliver a more intense burst of steam than a steam room or range top. Some physiotherapy experts have begun to incorporate steam into their rehabilitation practices. Although a cure has never originated for the common cold, steam is often cited as a reliable way to temporarily alleviate the symptoms. Some medical professionals recommend steam baths as a way to diminish the pain and stiffness associated with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Sources disagree on his relationship to the other kings in his line; he may have been the son of Hengist or Oisc, and may have been the father of Oisc or Eormenric. The dates of his reign are unclear, but he may have ruled from 512 to 534 or from 516 to 540. Despite his shadowy recorded history Octa made an impact on the Britons, who describe his deeds in several sources. Sources The 9th-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, one of the most important sources for this period of history, does not mention Octa. It does, however, mention Hengist and gives Oisc as his son. However, Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed around 731, names Octa as the son of \\"Orric, surnamed Oisc\\" and the grandson of Hengist.Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Book 2, chapter 5. Conversely, the 9th-century Cotton Vespasian manuscript indicates that Octa was the son of Hengist and the father of Oisc. Octa also appears in the Historia Brittonum, a 9th-century history of the Britons. According to the narrative, Hengist, who had settled in Britain with the consent of the British king Vortigern as defence against the Scots, sends for his sons Octa and Ebusa to supplement his forces. Octa and Ebusa subsequently raid Scotland.Historia Brittonum, ch. 38. After Hengist's death Octa becomes king of Kent.Historia Brittonum, ch. 56. Some manuscripts of the Historia include genealogies of the Saxon kingdoms; the genealogy of the kings of Kent names Octa as the son and successor to Hengist and the father to the subsequent king Ossa.Historia Brittonum, ch. 58. In literature Octa appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century pseudohistory Historia Regum Britanniae. The earlier scenes featuring him are taken directly from the Historia Brittonum, while the later scenes have no known source, and were likely invented by Geoffrey. As in the Historia Brittonum, Octa is brought to Britain by his father with Vortigern's consent.Historia Regum Britanniae, Book 6, chapter 13. Later, Vortigern is deposed by the rightful King of the Britons, Aurelius Ambrosius (the historical Ambrosius Aurelianus) and Hengist is captured and later executed. Octa leads his men to York and continues to harry the Britons, along with his kinsman Eosa.Historia Regum Britanniae, Book 8, chapter 6. Aurelius besieges York, and eventually Octa surrenders. He negotiates a truce in which the Saxons are allowed to stay in northern Britain as vassals to Aurelius.Historia Regum Britanniae, Book 8, chapter 8. After the death of Aurelius, however, Octa and Eosa regard the treaty as no longer binding and resume their belligerence. The new king, Aurelius' brother Uther Pendragon, leads his armies against the Saxons and routs them in a surprise night attack. Octa and Eosa are taken prisoner, but they eventually escape and return to Germany. They return with a vast army, and Uther meets them again in a battle in which Octa and Eosa are finally slain.Historia Regum Britanniae, Book 8, chapter 18; 21‚Äì23. Octa may appear in Welsh Arthurian literature as Osla Bigknife, though this character may be better identified with Offa of Mercia.Gantz, p. 19. This Osla figures in two medieval prose tales, Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100) and The Dream of Rhonabwy (12th- or 13th-century). In Culhwch he is a member of King Arthur's retinue; he is named in a list of Arthur's followers, and his weapon \\"Bronllavyn Short Broad\\", which is wide enough for Arthur's army to use as a bridge, is described.Gantz, pp. 144‚Äì145. Osla later participates in the hunt for the great boar Twrch Trwyth, during which he nearly drowns when the sheath of his great knife fills with water.Gantz, p. 174. In Rhonabwy Osla is Arthur's opponent at the Battle of Badon.Gantz, p. 183. Notes References *Gantz, Jeffrey (translator) (1987). The Mabinogion. New York: Penguin. .

Synopsis The series revolved around a group of nurses working at the same Miami hospital as Empty Nests Dr. Harry Weston. Initially, the main characters were strong-willed nurse Annie Roland (Arnetia Walker), sarcastic nurse Sandy Miller (Stephanie Hodge), dim-witted nurse Julie Milbury (Mary Jo Keenen) and Latina nurse Gina Cuevas (Ada Maris) who frequently reminisced about her homeland, the fictional San Peque√±o. Also in the cast were arrogant Dr. Hank Kaplan (Kip Gilman), wise-cracking orderly Paco Ortiz (Carlos Lacamara) and flaky nurse Greg Vincent (Jeff Altman). In addition, Florence Stanley had a recurring role during the first season as Dr. Riskin. However, changes were made after the first season. In an effort to boost ratings, David Rasche joined the cast in the second season as Jack Trenton, a slimy white-collar criminal forced to perform community service at the hospital, and in the final season Loni Anderson joined the cast as new hospital administrator Casey McAfee. Other changes included the addition of Markus Flanagan as hunky orderly Luke Fitzgerald for the second season only, the changing of the show's theme song in seasons two and three, having nurse Gina and Dr. Hank Kaplan get married (Gina being pregnant with Dr. Hank's child). Nurse Greg Vincent was also written off after season one. In the series' final season, nurse Sandy was gone, and the series' focus moved increasingly from the nurses to Casey McAfee's adjustments in running the hospital under a new HMO, and the antics of Jack Trenton and his sidekick Paco the orderly.\\"Reruns on Lifetime\\" Cast * Stephanie Hodge as Nurse Sandy Miller (1991‚Äì1993) * Arnetia Walker as Nurse Annie Roland * Mary Jo Keenen as Nurse Julie Milbury * Jeff Altman as Greg Vincent (1991‚Äì1992) * Ada Maris as Gina Cuevas * Kip Gilman as Dr. Hank Kaplan * Carlos Lac√°mara as Paco Ortiz * Florence Stanley as Dr. Riskin (1991‚Äì1992) * Markus Flanagan as Luke Fitzgerald (1992‚Äì1993) * David Rasche as Jack Trenton (1992‚Äì1994) * Loni Anderson as Casey MacAfee (1993‚Äì1994) Episodes Crossovers The following is a list of Nurses episodes featuring characters from The Golden Girls and Empty Nest. ;Season One *Episode 2: \\"A Lesson in Life\\" ‚Äì Laverne Todd from Empty Nest *Episode 6: \\"Mother, Jugs, and Zach\\" ‚Äì Harry Weston from Empty Nest *Episode 9: \\"Begone with the Wind\\" ‚Äì Rose Nylund from The Golden Girls and Laverne Todd from Empty Nest *Episode 20: \\"Moon Over Miami\\" ‚Äì Blanche Devereaux from The Golden Girls and Charley Dietz from Empty Nest ;Season Two *Episode 2: \\"In My New Country\\" ‚Äì Laverne Todd from Empty Nest *Episode 7: \\"Playing Doctor\\" ‚Äì Carol Weston from Empty Nest ;Season Three *Episode 1: \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" ‚Äì Harry Weston from Empty Nest *Episode 4: \\"Jack's Indecent Proposal ‚Äì Charley Dietz from Empty Nest *Episode 7: \\"The Bridges of Dade Country\\" ‚Äì Harry Weston from Empty Nest *Episode 9: \\"Temporary Setbacks\\" ‚Äì Sophia Petrillo from The Golden Girls and Empty Nest, and Carol Weston from Empty Nest *Episode 10: \\"The Birth of a Marriage\\" ‚Äì Harry Weston from Empty Nest References External links * * Category:1991 American television series debuts Category:1994 American television series endings Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1990s American medical television series Category:American television spin-offs Category:English-language television shows Category:Works about nursing Category:NBC original programming Category:Television shows set in Miami Category:Television series by ABC Studios Category:The Golden Girls ","title":"Nurses (American TV series)"},{"id":"2533494","text":"Three Churches is an unincorporated community in Hampshire County in the U.S. state of West Virginia.

He joined Studebaker from the McCulloch Motors Corporation, with no experience of the automobile industry.Business: Sherwood Harry Egbert Profile at Time.com, 21 April 1961. He replaced former president Harold E. Churchill under a corporate goal of diversification‚Äîto get the company out of carmaking and \\"absorb Studebaker's tax loss credits ($94 million) by merging with prosperous companies\\". Instead, Egbert took a genuine interest in the cars and moved his home to the Studebaker proving grounds lodge. He set out to resurrect the auto division's flagging fortunes, encouraged by industry reports of projected sales figures that indicated that there would still be room for a smaller manufacturer. He initiated production of the stylish Avanti, based on a Lark chassis and drivetrain with fiberglass bodywork designed by a team headed by Raymond Loewy. The car was in production by the spring of 1962, insufficient lead time for comprehensive assembly and distribution of the many orders soon received. He had hoped to sell 20,000 Avantis that year but could only build 1200. To revamp the Studebaker passenger cars, Egbert hired Brooks Stevens \\"on a minuscule budget\\", with good results such as the Gran Turismo Hawk; overall sales continued to be well below the break-even point. Disagreements between Egbert and Studebaker's board of directors exacerbated the illness with which he was diagnosed in 1962. Cancer surgeries and lengthy recuperation absence allowed the board to ease him out of office, replacing him as president with Byers A. Burlingame. He resigned on November 24, 1963. Studebaker closed its U.S. auto manufacturing operations just a month later. Production was moved to the Canadian plant where Studebaker continued building cars until March 1966. In 1964 Egbert established a management consulting firm in Los Angeles. Egbert died in Los Angeles in 1969.

Manuka Shops, Manuka Oval, Manuka Swimming Pool, and Manuka Circle take their name from the park in the area.  Origin of name  Leptospermum scoparium, the flowers and leaves of the Manuka tea tree The precinct is named after Manuka Circle, the street which forms the northern boundary of the precinct. Manuka Circle was on Walter Burley Griffin's original plan for Canberra and named after the New Zealand tea tree Leptospermum scoparium. The name Manuka is somewhat peculiar in that it is pronounced by local Canberrans differently from the tree from which it gets its name: compared to for the tree. When Griffin drew up his plans in 1912, there was still some optimism that New Zealand might join the Federation of Australia. Griffin's plans included eight avenues radiating out from Capital Hill named after the capitals of the six states, the capital of the Northern Territory and the capital of New Zealand. Before the name Wellington Avenue was gazetted it was realised that New Zealand was not going to become part of a federation of Australasia and the name was replaced by Canberra Avenue. Griffin planned that the state capital city avenues were terminated with a park named after the generic botanical name for a native plant from that particular site; for example, Telopea Park is named after the waratah, the floral emblem of New South Wales, and is at the end of Sydney Avenue, named after the capital of New South Wales. Another remnant of Griffin's nomenclature was the Wellington Hotel, formerly on the corner of Canberra Avenue and National Circuit which was demolished and replaced by the hotel known in 2005 as \\"Rydges Capital Hill Canberra\\".  History  Ruins of the Canberra Services Club Former Griffith Child Welfare Centre Business allotments for Manuka were included in the first auction of city leases in December 1924. At the same time leases were sold in the city, Braddon, Kingston, Forrest and Red Hill. Lessees were required to erect buildings of approved design on the blocks within three years. The decision to develop business centres at both Kingston (then called Eastlake) and Manuka, which were within of each other had been made in the absence of Sir John Sulman, the chair of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee. He later recorded his disapproval of the decision. Sulman had designed Manuka and it was intended to be the principal commercial centre on the south side. The decision to allow the development of Eastlake meant that in Manuka investment lagged and building was slow. Eastlake was preferred by residents as a business centre because of the bigger shops and closer proximity to more homes, as well as being closer to the previously only substantial shop in the Territory, which was near Canberra railway station. The opening of the Capitol Theatre, and the convent school associated with St Christopher's Catholic cathedral, allowed the Manuka businesses to develop competitively. Manuka includes several areas that are listed by the ACT Heritage Council: *St Christopher's Cathedral Precinct, which has been the centre of Catholic worship and education in the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn since 1928. *St Paul‚Äôs Church on the corner of Canberra Avenue and Captain Cook Crescent, which the Heritage Council considers to be an excellent example of an Inter-War Gothic church with Art Deco influences. The church was designed by Sydney Architects Burcham Clamp and Son and dedicated on 6 August 1939. *The Manuka Oval and Caretaker‚Äôs Cottage, which began to be developed as a sports ground in the early 1920s and began to be developed as a formal enclosed oval in March 1929. The Heritage Council considers that it is \\"significant for its continual use as a Canberra sporting facility, retaining an array of features such as the historic tree plantings, the oval, the Caretaker's Cottage and the later scoreboard which tell the story of its development as a popular sporting venue.\\" *Manuka Swimming Pool on Manuka Circle, which was completed in 1930. The ACT Heritage Council considers it to be \\"an important component of the body of ‚ÄòFederal Capital‚Äô style public buildings associated with the establishment of Canberra as the National Capital.\\" *The Canberra Services Club at 14 Manuka Circle, which the ACT Heritage Council considers to be historically significant for its association with the provision of hospitality to service personnel by Canberra volunteers during World War II. Lady Gowrie, the wife of the Governor General, played a major role in establishing it, including fund-raising. The Services Club burnt down in April 2011, but it has been decided to rebuild it. *The former Griffith Child Welfare Centre at 30 Manuka Circle, which was opened in 1937. The Heritage Council considers it to be important as the first permanent baby health centre in the ACT.  Facilities  = Shops = Flinders Way, Manuka Shops were first built in Manuka between 1925 and 1930. In recent years a collection of outdoor cafes has taken over the more utilitarian shops that dominated the area up to the late 1970s. In the 1960s the precinct included a hardware shop, two supermarkets, a large delicatessen, two butchers, a fishmongers, at least one green grocer, several florists, a boot shop and repairer, clothes shops, home wares and furniture shops, several shoe shops, chemists, newsagents, several barbers and hairdressers and a shop selling church candles. Manuka is now known for its restaurants and for some nightclubs. Interior of Manuka Pool photographed by William James Mildenhall about the 1930s = Manuka Pool = Building work commenced on the pool in July 1930. It was the first swimming pool to be built for the city. Before its completion, Canberrans swam in the Molonglo River and other local swimming holes at the Cotter and Murrumbidgee Rivers. Canberra's first pool was built on the south side as it was closer to more Canberra residents than any northside location. The pool was officially opened on 26 January 1931. = Manuka Oval = Manuka Oval has a seating capacity of 13,550 people and an overall capacity of 16,000 people, although this is lower for some sports depending on the configuration used.Manuka Oval ‚Äì Austadiums. Retrieved 20 March 2016. The area on which the ground is situated has been used for sport since the early 20th century, but was only enclosed in 1929. It has since undergone several redevelopments, most recently beginning in 2011. = St Christopher's Cathedral = St Christopher's Cathedral St Christopher's Cathedral is adjacent to the shopping district, and is technically located in the suburb of Forrest. The first stage of St Christopher's Cathedral which was completed in 1939. St Christopher's was finally extended to its present size in 1973, when it became the co-cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn, and more recently the sole cathedral when the former cathedral in Goulburn ceased to be a cathedral of the archdiocese. It was listed by the ACT Heritage Council in 1998. = St Paul's Church = Founded in 1939 it part of the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is listed in the ACT Heritage Register as an \\"...excellent example of an Inter-War Gothic church with Art Deco influences\\". It was the first place in Australia to install a combination organ and has the only peal of bells in the Australian Capital Territory. It is situated on the corner of Canberra Avenue and Captain Cook Crescent, opposite Manuka Oval. = Capitol Theatre = Capitol Theatre about 1928 photographed by W. J. Mildenhall The Capitol Theatre was one of Canberra's most important centres for entertainment in the early life of the city, with many plays and films. The design was to the requirements of the theatre impresario J.C. Williamson. It was opened in 1927 and hosted a reception for the arrival of aviator Bert Hinkler in Canberra in 1928. The theatre was later bulldozed in 1980 and the present Greater Union cinema built on the site. The decision to destroy such an important building of Canberra's heritage was controversial at the time and since.

It is the oldest continually operating theatre in Australia; No√´l Coward once called it \\"a dream of a theatre\\" and Laurence Olivier launched a national appeal for its reconstruction in the 1940s. History =1834‚Äì1856, Construction and early years= In 1834, Peter Degraves, founder of Cascade Brewery, and a group of Hobart citizens purchased dock-side land for the purpose of building a public theatre. Architect John Lee Archer created a provincial Georgian design and the first stone was laid that year. The location was not ideal for future gentry audiences; it was in a rough and foul-smelling area near an abattoir, brothels, factories, and pubs. The architect accommodated the local population by creating an entrance through a neighbouring pub directly into the theatre's pit seating, colloquially known as \\"the Shades.\\" When a national economic downturn caused most of the original investors to pull out, Degraves stepped in and took complete ownership. The building was completed, using convict labor in part, by the end of 1836. It staged its inaugural performances in March 1837; Thomas Morton's Speed the Plough and the W. Oxberry's The Spoiled Child. In June, the theatre was formally named the \\"Royal Victoria Theatre\\" in honor of the coronation of the Queen of England but it became known simply as \\"The Theatre Royal.\\" During the period of Anne Clarke's tenure as manager (1840-1847), the theater became renowned as a pioneer theater institution in Australia for its high quality and Clarke was credited by the press with introducing 'a better class of performer and a superior style of management' and for giving theater, which was then regarded as somewhat dubious, a good name.E Webby, 'Anne Clarke', in P Parsons (ed), Companion to theatre in Australia, Sydney, 1995. =1856‚Äì1911, Cockfights etc= Due to the neighbourhood, early performances tended towards cockfights, boxing, and religious meetings. The patrons of the Shades included visiting seamen and workers from the convict-laden Wapping area surrounding the theatre. They became known for their drunken and disruptive interactions with performers. Degraves undertook a major renovation in 1856 but it didn't improve bookings or offerings. Following Degraves' death in 1883, Richard Lewis purchased the theatre for ¬£3222. For the next 40 years or so, Lewis made improvements to further attempt to upgrade the theatre's fashion. In 1911 the interior was completely rebuilt, creating the Louis Quatorze style auditorium there today. Designed by William Pitt from Melbourne, who specialised in theatres, the Shades was replaced with raked stalls seating, and a higher and steeper balcony was built above. The decoration featured red velvet upholstery, gilded highlights, and a crystal chandelier in a domed ceiling. =1911‚Äì1952, Decline and first major renovation= Despite continued attempts at maintaining the theatre, it declined over the next 3 decades. By the 1940s, the performers had to beware of holes in the stage, unsafe wiring, faulty heating, and cockroaches. Unsafe conditions eventually led to a planned demolition. In 1948, Sir Laurence Olivier arrived in Hobart as part of the Old Vic touring company and spoke passionately about the theatre, launching a national appeal; > \\"We appreciate playing in it not only because it is a beautiful little > theatre; it is more than that. Your parents and grandparents have sat here > as audience. Our parents have acted on this stage. In the one hundred and > eleven years it has been played in it has built up atmosphere and the secret > of atmosphere is antiquity. Don‚Äôt let it go.\\" His speech was effective. The state government purchased the theatre for ¬£12,000 with the promise of restoration if matching funds were raised. An ambitious public campaign followed and by 1952, the renovations were completed. 'Royal boxes' had been installed specifically for an anticipated visit from then-Princess Elizabeth. King George's death curtailed the planned audience but the theatre re-opened on schedule. The updates were a success; the theatre was booked with frequent productions and became home to a new resident company. =1952‚Äì1986, Expansion and fire= The theatre enjoyed several successful decades marked with periodic structural updates. In the early 1980s, a A$1 million-dollar refurbishment was launched in honor of the theatre's 150-year anniversary. In addition to restoring much of the 1911 decorations, the backstage facilities were modernized and reconfigured to become the Backspace Theatre, a venue for cabaret and smaller local companies. The work was almost complete when, on 18 June 1984, a fire began backstage and spread to the main auditorium. In addition to structural damage to the roof, the water and smoke damage was extensive but was somewhat contained by a fire curtain that somewhat inexplicably fell across the stage. Most of the furniture, decoration, and technical equipment was damaged; only one painting survived. 'Australia's grand old lady of the theatre world' was quickly launched back into reconstruction, covered by a public fundraising appeal, adequate insurance and the State Government's assurance. However, it would take several years for the theatre to re-open. =1986‚ÄìCurrent= The theatre completed its major refurbishment and reopened in March 1986. It re- established itself as a centre of Hobart's social life, thanks in part to government policies encouraging national touring of popular theatre shows. It presents an annual program that features live theatre, contemporary music, dance and entertainment. Since 1994, it has offered a subscription season and has seen both the number of performances and overall attendances increase steadily. The theatre has incorporated modern technology with the computerisation of the lighting control system and the installation of a computerised ticketing system.  Fred the Ghost  The theatre's mascot is a resident ghost of a former actor who was allegedly killed during a fight in the basement. Known as \\"Fred\\", the theatre used the ghost for the first time in the 1948 restoration appeal.

The event was held by Project Eye-To-Eye to raise awareness of Learning Disabilities Month. Invisible disabilities, also known as Hidden Disabilities or Non-visible Disabilities (NVD), are disabilities that are not immediately apparent, are typically chronic illnesses and conditions that significantly impair normal activities of daily living. For instance, some people with visual or auditory disabilities who do not wear glasses or hearing aids, or who use discreet hearing aids, may not be obviously disabled. Some people who have vision loss may wear contact lenses. A sitting disability is another category of invisible impairments; sitting problems are usually caused by chronic back pain. Those with joint problems or chronic pain may not use mobility aids on some days, or at all. Most people with RSI move in a typical and inconspicuous way, and are even encouraged by the medical community to be as active as possible, including playing sports; yet those people can have dramatic limitations in how much they can type, write or how long they can hold a phone or other objects in their hands. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people live with an invisible disability. Impact Invisible disabilities, also known as Hidden Disabilities or Non-visible Disabilities (NVD), can hinder a person's efforts to go to school, work, socialize, and more. Although the disability creates a challenge for the person who has it, the reality of the disability can be difficult for others to recognize or acknowledge. Others may not understand the cause of the problem, if they cannot see evidence of it in a visible way. Students with cognitive impairments find it difficult to organize and complete school work, but teachers who are unaware of the reason for a student's difficulties, can become impatient: This lack of understanding can be detrimental to a person's social capital. People may see someone with an invisible disability as lazy, weak, or antisocial. A disability may cause someone to lose connections with friends or family due to this lack of understanding, potentially leading to a lower self-esteem. A disability that may be visible in some situations may not be obvious in others, which can result in a serious problem. For example, a plane passenger who is deaf may be unable to hear verbal instructions given by a flight attendant. It is for this reason that travellers with a hidden disability are advised to inform the airline of their need for accommodations before their flight: Some employees with an invisible disability choose not to disclose their diagnosis with their employer, due to social stigma directed at people with disabilities, either in the workplace or in society in general. This may occur when a psychiatric disability is involved, or a number of other medical conditions that are invisible. Researchers in the human resources field may need to take this non- disclosure into account when carrying out studies. Many people who think of those with a disability generally consider them lower to middle class due to their medical costs, and also because many people with disabilities often lack reliable, full-time employment. According to one US survey, 74% of individuals with a disability do not use a wheelchair or other aids that may visually portray their disability. A 2011 survey found that 88% of people with an invisible disability had negative views of disclosing their disability to employers. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2017 states that the unemployment rate for individuals with an invisible disability is higher than those without one. The unemployment rate for people with a disability was 9.2%, while the rate of those without was less than half of this at only 4.2%. BBC states that people with HIV specifically have an unemployment rate three times higher than those without HIV. Beyond the work force, BLS data also showed that individuals with an invisible disability are also less likely to receive a bachelor's degree or higher education. Prevalence =United States= In the United States, 96% of people with chronic medical conditions show no outward signs of their illness, and 10% experience symptoms that are considered disabling. Nearly one in two Americans (165 million) has a chronic medical condition of one kind or another.\\"Chronic Conditions: Making the Case for Ongoing Care\\". Chronic Care in America: A 21st Century Challenge, a study of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation & Partnership for Solutions: Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (September 2004 Update). However, most of these people are not actually disabled, as their medical conditions do not impair normal activities. Ninety- six percent of people with chronic medical conditions live with a condition that is invisible. These people do not use a cane or any assistive device and act as if they didn't have a medical condition.2002 US Census Bureau About a quarter of them have some type of activity limitation, ranging from mild to severe; the remaining 75% are not disabled by their chronic conditions. Legal protection Those with invisible disabilities are protected by national and local disability laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in the US. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has been amended several times such that the definition of \\"handicapped\\" includes the statement, \\"any person who... (C) is regarded as having such an impairment\\".Pelka, Fred. The ABC-CLIO Companion to The Disability Rights Movement. CA: ABC-CLIO, 1997. p. 264 This particular defining point of \\"handicapped\\" puts the assessment of impairment in the hands of observers who may or may not regard others as having an impairment. For people with disabilities, invisible or not, this creates a space for discriminatory practices which stem from the observer's perception of who is disabled and who is not. In the United Kingdom, the Equality Act 2010 (and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 before it) require employers to make reasonable adjustments for employees with special needs, including disabilities both visible and invisible. Responses A growing number of organizations, governments, and institutions are implementing policies and regulations to accommodate persons with invisible disabilities. Governments and school boards have implemented screening tests to identify students with learning disabilities, as well as other invisible disabilities, such as vision or hearing difficulties, or problems in cognitive ability, motor skills, or social or emotional development. If a hidden disability is identified, resources can be used to place a child in a special education program that will help them progress in school. One mitigation is to provide an easy way for people to self-designate as having an invisible disability, and for organisations to have processes in place to assist those so self-designating. An example of this is the Hidden Disability Sunflower, initially launched in the UK in 2016 but now gaining some international recognition as well.

This generalizes the geometric series. The series is named after the mathematician Carl Neumann, who used it in 1877 in the context of potential theory. The Neumann series is used in functional analysis. It forms the basis of the Liouville-Neumann series, which is used to solve Fredholm integral equations. It is also important when studying the spectrum of bounded operators.  Properties  Suppose that T is a bounded linear operator on the normed vector space X. If the Neumann series converges in the operator norm, then Id ‚Äì T is invertible and its inverse is the series: : (\\\\mathrm{Id} - T)^{-1} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty T^k , where \\\\mathrm{Id} is the identity operator in X. To see why, consider the partial sums :S_n := \\\\sum_{k=0}^n T^k. Then we have :\\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}(\\\\mathrm{Id}-T)S_n = \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=0}^n T^k - \\\\sum_{k=0}^n T^{k+1}\\\\right) = \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{Id} - T^{n+1}\\\\right) = \\\\mathrm{Id}. This result on operators is analogous to geometric series in \\\\mathbb{R}, in which we find that: :(1-x)\\\\cdot(1 + x + x^2 + \\\\cdots + x^{n-1} + x^n) = 1-x^{n+1}, :1 + x + x^2 + \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{1}{1-x}. One case in which convergence is guaranteed is when X is a Banach space and T < 1 in the operator norm or \\\\sum T^n is convergent. However, there are also results which give weaker conditions under which the series converges.  Example  Let C\\\\in \\\\R^{3 \\\\times 3} be given by: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\ \\\\frac{5}{7} & 0 & \\\\frac{1}{7} \\\\ \\\\frac{3}{10} & \\\\frac{3}{5} & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. We need to show that C is smaller than unity in some norm. Therefore, we calculate: : \\\\begin{align} C_{\\\\infty} &=\\\\max_i \\\\sum_j c_{ij} = \\\\max \\\\left\\\\lbrace \\\\frac{3}{4}, \\\\frac{6}{7} , \\\\frac{9}{10} \\\\right\\\\rbrace = \\\\frac{9}{10} < 1\\\\. \\\\end{align} Thus, we know from the statement above that (I-C)^{-1} exists.  The set of invertible operators is open  A corollary is that the set of invertible operators between two Banach spaces B and B' is open in the topology induced by the operator norm. Indeed, let S : B -> B' be an invertible operator and let T: B -> B' be another operator. If S ‚Äì T  < S‚àí1‚àí1, then T is also invertible. Since Id ‚Äì S‚àí1T < 1, the Neumann series Œ£(Id ‚Äì (S‚àí1T))k is convergent. Therefore, we have T‚àí1S = (Id ‚Äì (Id ‚Äì S‚àí1T))‚àí1 = Œ£(Id ‚Äì (S‚àí1T))k. Taking the norms, we get T‚àí1S ‚â§ 1/(1 ‚Äì Id ‚Äì (S‚àí1T)). The norm of T‚àí1 can be bounded by : T^{-1} \\\\le \\\\tfrac{1}{1-q} S^{-1} \\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad q = S-T \\\\, S^{-1}.

FTAs, a form of trade pacts, determine the tariffs and duties that countries impose on imports and exports with the goal of reducing or eliminating trade barriers, thus encouraging international trade. Such agreements usually \\"center on a chapter providing for preferential tariff treatment\\", but they also often \\"include clauses on trade facilitation and rule-making in areas such as investment, intellectual property, government procurement, technical standards and sanitary and phytosanitary issues\\". Important distinctions exist between customs unions and free-trade areas. Both types of trading bloc have internal arrangements which parties conclude in order to liberalize and facilitate trade among themselves. The crucial difference between customs unions and free-trade areas is their approach to third parties. While a customs union requires all parties to establish and maintain identical external tariffs with regard to trade with non-parties, parties to a free- trade area are not subject to such a requirement. Instead, they may establish and maintain whatever tariff regime applying to imports from non-parties as they deem necessary. In a free-trade area without harmonized external tariffs, to eliminate the risk of trade deflection, parties will adopt a system of preferential rules of origin. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) originally defined free-trade agreements to include only trade in goods. An agreement with a similar purpose, i.e., to enhance liberalization of trade in services, is named under Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Service (GATS) as an \\"economic integration agreement\\". However, in practice, the term is now widely used to refer to agreements covering not only goods but also services and even investment.  History  The OED records the use of the phrase \\"free trade agreement\\" with reference to the Australian colonies as early as 1877.  Legal aspects of free trade agreements  The formation of free-trade areas is considered an exception to the most favored nation (MFN) principle in the World Trade Organization (WTO) because the preferences that parties to a free-trade area exclusively grant each other go beyond their accession commitments. Although Article XXIV of the GATT allows WTO members to establish free-trade areas or to adopt interim agreements necessary for the establishment thereof, there are several conditions with respect to free-trade areas, or interim agreements leading to the formation of free-trade areas. Firstly, duties and other regulations maintained in each of the signatory parties to a free-trade area, which are applicable at the time such free-trade area is formed, to the trade with non-parties to such free-trade area shall not be higher or more restrictive than the corresponding duties and other regulations existing in the same signatory parties prior to the formation of the free-trade area. In other words, the establishment of a free-trade area to grant preferential treatment among its member is legitimate under WTO law, but the parties to a free-trade area are not permitted to treat non-parties less favorably than before the area is established. A second requirement stipulated by Article XXIV is that tariffs and other barriers to trade must be eliminated to substantially all the trade within the free-trade area. Free trade agreements forming free-trade areas generally lie outside the realm of the multilateral trading system. However, WTO members must notify to the Secretariat when they conclude new free trade agreements and in principle the texts of free trade agreements are subject to review under the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements. Although a dispute arising within free-trade areas are not subject to litigation at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, \\"there is no guarantee that WTO panels will abide by them and decline to exercise jurisdiction in a given case\\". It is also important to note that a free trade agreement is a reciprocal agreement, which is allowed by Article XXIV of the GATT. Whereas, autonomous trade arrangements in favor of developing and least developed countries are permitted by the Decision on Differential and More Favorable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries adopted by signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1979 (the ‚ÄúEnabling Clause‚Äù). It is the WTO's legal basis for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Both free trade agreements and preferential trade arrangements (as named by the WTO) are considered as derogation to the MFN principle.  Economic aspects of free trade agreements  =Trade diversion and trade creation= In general, trade diversion means that an FTA would divert trade away from more efficient suppliers outside the area towards less efficient ones within the areas. Whereas, trade creation implies that an FTA area creates trade which may not have otherwise existed. In all cases trade creation will raise a country's national welfare. Both trade creation and trade diversion are crucial effects found upon the establishment of an FTA. Trade creation will cause consumption to shift from a high-cost producer to a low-cost one, and trade will thus expand. In contrast, trade diversion will lead to trade shifting from a lower-cost producer outside the area to a higher-cost one inside the FTA. Such a shift will not benefit consumers within the FTA as they are deprived the opportunity to purchase cheaper imported goods. However, economists find that trade diversion does not always harm aggregate national welfare: it can even improve aggregate national welfare if the volume of diverted trade is small. =FTAs as public goods= Economist have made attempts to evaluate the extent to which FTAs can be considered public goods. They first address one key element of FTAs, which is the system of embedded tribunals which act as arbitrators in international trade disputes. These serve as a force of clarification for existing statutes and international economic policies as affirmed in the trade treaties. The second way in which FTAs are considered public goods is tied to the evolving trend of them becoming ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù. The depth of an FTA refers to the added types of structural policies that it covers. While older trade deals are deemed ‚Äúshallower‚Äù as they cover fewer areas (such as tariffs and quotas), more recently concluded agreements address a number of other fields, from services to e-commerce and data localization. Since transactions among parties to an FTA are relatively cheaper as compared to those with non-parties, FTAs are conventionally found to be excludable. Now that deep trade deals will enhance regulatory harmonization and increase trade flows with non-parties, thus reduce the excludability of FTA benefits, new generation FTAs are obtaining essential characteristics public goods.  Qualifying for preferences under an FTA  Further information: Rules of origin Unlike a customs union, parties to an FTA do not maintain common external tariffs, which means they apply different customs duties, as well as other policies with respect to non- members. This feature creates the possibility of non-parties may free-riding preferences under an FTA by penetrating the market with the lowest external tariffs. Such risk necessitates the introduction of rules to determine originating goods eligible for preferences under an FTA, a need that does not arise upon the formation of a customs union. Basically, there is a requirement for a minimum extent of processing that results in \\"substantial transformation\\" to the goods so that they can be considered originating. By defining which goods are originating in the PTA, preferential rules of origin distinguish between originating and non-originating goods: only the former will be entitled to preferential tariffs scheduled by the FTA, the latter must pay MFN import duties. It is noted that in qualifying for origin criteria, there is a differential treatment between inputs originating within and outside an FTA. Normally inputs originating in one FTA party will be considered as originating in the other party if they are incorporated in the manufacturing process in that other party. Sometimes, production costs arising in one party is also considered as that arising in another party. In preferential rules of origin, such differential treatment is normally provided for in the cumulation or accumulation provision. Such clause further explains the trade creation and trade diversion effects of an FTA mentioned above, because a party to an FTA has the incentive to use inputs originating in another party so that their products may qualify for originating status.  Databases on FTAs  The database on trade agreements provided by ITC's Market Access Map. Since there are hundreds of FTAs currently in force and being negotiated (about 800 according to ITC's Rules of Origin Facilitator, counting also non-reciprocal trade arrangements), it is important for businesses and policy-makers to keep track of their status. There are a number of depositories of free trade agreements available either at national, regional or international levels. Some significant ones include the database on Latin American free trade agreements constructed by the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), the database maintained by the Asian Regional Integration Center (ARIC) providing information agreements of Asian countries, and the portal on the European Union's free trade negotiations and agreements. At the international level, there are two important free-access databases developed by international organizations for policy-makers and businesses: The database on Trade Agreements provided by ITC's Market Access Map =WTO's Regional Trade Agreements Information System= As WTO members are obliged to notify to the Secretariat their free trade agreements, this database is constructed based on the most official source of information on free trade agreements (referred to as regional trade agreements in the WTO language). The database allows users to seek information on trade agreements notified to the WTO by country or by topic (goods, services or goods and services). This database provides users with an updated list of all agreements in force, however, those not notified to the WTO may be missing. It also displays reports, tables and graphs containing statistics on these agreements, and particularly preferential tariff analysis. =ITC's Market Access Map= The Market Access Map was developed by the International Trade Centre (ITC) with the objectives to facilitate businesses, governments and researchers in market access issues. The database, visible via the online tool Market Access Map, includes information on tariff and non-tariff barriers in all active trade agreements, not limited to those officially notified to the WTO. It also documents data on non-preferential trade agreements (for instance, Generalized System of Preferences schemes). Up until 2019, Market Access Map has provided downloadable links to texts agreements and their rules of origin. The new version of Market Access Map forthcoming this year will provide direct web links to relevant agreement pages and connect itself to other ITC's tools, particularly the Rules of Origin Facilitator. It is expected to become a versatile tool which assists enterprises in understanding free trade agreements and qualifying for origin requirements under these agreements.

Contemporary abolitionists characterised the practice as virtual slavery, and some, but by no means all, latter-day historians have agreed with this assessment. In Australia, every penal colony except Western Australia had a system of convict assignment. Convicts in Western Australia were never assigned, with the debatable exception of the Parkhurst apprentices. The system was abolished in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land on 1 July 1841 and replaced with the probation gang system.

Telegraphist was one of the first \\"high-technology\\" professions of the modern era. Many young men and young women left their farms and fishing communities in the late 19th century to take high-paying jobs as professional telegraph operators. In those early days telegraphers were in such demand that operators could move from place to place and job to job to achieve ever-higher salaries, thereby freeing them from subsistence lives on family farms. During the Great War the Royal Navy enlisted many volunteers as radio telegraphists. Telegraphists were indispensable at sea in the early days of wireless telegraphy, and many young men were called to sea as professional radiotelegraph operators who were always accorded high-paying officer status at sea. Subsequent to the Titanic disaster and the Radio Act of 1912, the International Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) conventions established the 500kHz maritime distress frequency monitoring and mandated that all passenger-carrying ships carry licensed radio telegraph operators. High-paying jobs as seagoing ship's radiotelegraphy officers were still common until the late 20th century. In the 21st century, the employment of professional radio telegraphers was largely discontinued in maritime service and replaced by the use of satellite communications services. The use of Morse code is over a century old. Fluent Morse code telegraphers still enjoy sending Morse code using manually operated mechanical keys or electronic keyers. Although Morse code is no longer used in commercial practices, the use of hand-sent Morse code seems to be growing among amateur radio operators, even though Morse proficiency is no longer required to obtain an amateur radio licence. Using the computer keyboard or hand-operated telegraph key, today almost all Morse code operators are amateur radio enthusiasts.

In May 2020, Miller announced his retirement from cricket. Miller was a bowler capable of performing effectively either as a right arm fast-medium or offbreak bowler and achieved a Test average of 26.15. A tailend batsman who made three fifties in 126 first-class matches, he is particularly remembered for appearing with his hair dyed blue in a Test match against West Indies in 2001. Playing career He played two games for Victoria in 1985‚Äì86, but unable to command a regular place in the state team he moved to South Australia, where he played from 1988‚Äì89 to 1991‚Äì92. He then moved to Tasmania, where he played from 1992‚Äì93 to 1999‚Äì2000, before returning to Victoria for 2000‚Äì01 and 2001‚Äì02. In the 1997‚Äì98 season he took 70 wickets at 24.98,Bowling by season including his best innings figures of 7 for 49, when he bowled unchanged throughout Victoria's second innings.Victoria v Tasmania 1997‚Äì98 Miller began as a right-arm fast-medium bowler, but changed to right-arm offbreak spin after an ankle injury. He mixed both styles with considerable success, and was a surprise addition to the Australian Test team at the age of 34, being able to act both as the second spin bowler and the third pace bowler. He played Test cricket principally as an off-spinner, and took 69 wickets at an average of 26.15. His best innings and match figures came in the Third Test against West Indies in Adelaide in 2000‚Äì01, when he took 5 for 81 and 5 for 32.Australia v West Indies, Adelaide 2000‚Äì01 He won the award for the Australian Test Player of the Year in 2001. He toured England with Australia A in 1998, then toured Pakistan with the senior Australian side in 1998‚Äì99, making his Test debut. He also toured West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, India and England with the Test team. He played with blue hair in a test match against the West Indies in 2001. His hair apparently made West Indies captain Courtney Walsh laugh. He retired from first-class cricket in 2002. Miller played for Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League in 1990 and 1991, finishing 1990 with 1078 runs and 100 wicketsWisden 1991, p. 895. and 1991 with 780 runs and 108 wickets.Wisden 1992, p. 886.

Life She was born in Sulzbach, a daughter of Berengar II, Count of Sulzbach (c. 1080 ‚Äì 3 December 1125) and his second spouse Adelheid of Wolfratshausen. He was one of the rulers who signed the Concordat of Worms (23 September 1122). In August, 1125, Berengar is mentioned in documents of Lothair III, King of the Romans. The death of Berengar is mentioned four months later. =Empress= Manuel I on the throne, with a Catholic monk and a messenger Emissaries of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos arrived in Germany, seeking an alliance against Roger II of Sicily. To seal the alliance, the emissaries requested that Conrad send a princess of his family to be married to the emperor's son, Manuel. Instead, Conrad selected his sister-in-law, Bertha, and after legally adopting her as his daughter, sent her to the Roman Empire escorted by Emicho von Leiningen, the Bishop of W√ºrzburg. By the time Bertha arrived at the Imperial court in Constantinople, the emperor John was dead, and his son Manuel was now the reigning emperor. Manuel delayed marrying her for three years, until shortly after Epiphany 1146, at which point she became empress and was renamed \\"Irene\\" (Œï·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑), a common name for foreign-born princesses. As an introduction for her to the Hellenic culture she was marrying into, John Tzetzes wrote his Allegories on the Iliad. Bertha-Irene was noted for shunning the frivolity of the luxurious Byzantine court; Basil of Ochrid, the archbishop of Thessalonica, praised her for her modesty and piety, and Nicetas Choniates (53sq.) noted that she did not wear face-paint. The patriarch of Constantinople, Cosmas II Atticus, who had been accused of heresy, allegedly cursed Bertha-Irene ªs womb in 1147 to prevent her bearing a son. Bertha-Irene died in Constantinople in 1159. Her husband Manuel was described as \\"roaring like a lion\\" in grief at her death, despite his infidelities during her lifetime.

She served two terms in the Minnesota House of Representatives, from 1951 to 1955, before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Minnesota's 9th congressional district as a member of the Democratic-Farmer- Labor Party (DFL). She served two terms there, in the 84th and 85th Congresses, (from January 3, 1955 to January 3, 1959). Knutson was the first woman elected to Congress from Minnesota, and is remembered today for the notorious \\"Coya, Come Home\\" letter supposedly written by her then-estranged husband, Andy, urging her to give up her seat and not seek reelection in 1958. Political rivals had put him up to it, and it was seen as instrumental in her ensuing defeat. The incident is often cited as an example of sexism in American politics. Early life Knutson was born Cornelia Genevive Gjesdal in Edmore, Ramsey County, North Dakota. She grew up on the farm where she was born, and inherited her politics from her father, a Populist who belonged to a socialist organization called the Non-Partisan League. After growing up and attending Concordia College in nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, Knutson planned on a career in opera and went to New York City to attend the Juilliard School for a year. When she realized she would not make it in opera, she returned to Minnesota, where she married Andy Knutson and moved to his farm near Oklee. Political career While she taught music and English at local high schools, sang at county fairs and worked with her husband to run a small local hotel, her marriage worsened. Andy Knutson was an alcoholic and he would often beat his wife when drunk. Nonetheless, the couple adopted an 8-year-old boy, named Terry, in 1948. (See \\"Soloman, John \\"The Cots Conspiracy \\" George Magazine, July 1997) Coya began to escape her domestic problems by getting involved in local politics, serving first on the Red Lake County Public Welfare Board in 1948, chairing the county DFL committee and attending that year's Democratic presidential convention as a delegate. Eventually, the DFL party asked her to run for the state House in 1950. =Congress= After winning, Knutson began to consider what she could do in federal office to help the struggling farmers of her district. In 1954 many were upset with the agricultural policies of the Dwight Eisenhower administration. She wanted to run against the district's Republican incumbent, Harold Hagen, but party leaders endorsed another candidate, Curtis Olsson. She had a thick accent and often sang and played her accordion at campaign events. DFL leaders at the time were trying to reach out beyond the party's rural base, and this clashed with the more polished image they were trying to cultivate at the time. Knutson financed her run by selling some land she had inherited from her father, and then barnstormed across the district, driving into farmers' fields to talk to them personally. She was an effective candidate and overwhelmingly won a five-way primary in an upset, then repeated the feat that fall in the general election as Democrats nationwide returned to majority status in the United States Congress. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn offered her a seat on any committee she wanted as a reward for her surprise success; her choice was the Agriculture Committee, making her its first ever female member. =1956 presidential primary= In 1956, as Knutson's first term in Congress drew to a close, DFL leaders back in Minnesota had decided to throw their weight behind former Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson as their choice for the Democratic Party's nominee to challenge President Dwight Eisenhower in that year's presidential election, because Stevenson had indicated that he was likely to pick Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey as his running mate. Knutson, however, was more enthusiastic about Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, whose farm policies and proposals were more popular in her district. She endorsed him, chaired his campaign in Minnesota, and campaigned vigorously for him. When he defeated Stevenson in Minnesota's primary election, DFL leaders were furious and swore revenge. Ultimately, Stevenson won the Democratic nomination, but Kefauver was chosen over Humphrey as his running mate. The ticket, however, lost to the Republicans. =\\"Coya, Come Home\\"= They would get their chance in the next election cycle, after she held off Hagen to win reelection. Knutson had moved Terry to Washington, D.C. to get away from Andy and his drunkenness and battering, and spent much of her time there. While she had little real social life, rumors (perhaps deliberately started) began to circulate that she and her chief of staff Bill Kjeldahl were having an affair. Shortly before the 1958 DFL district convention, a letter signed by Andy (but not written by him, the work of Democratic political rivals of Knutson) was circulated to reporters. It soon ran in newspapers across the country with the headline \\"Coya, Come Home.\\" > Coya, I want you to tell the people of the 9th District this Sunday that you > are through in politics. That you want to go home and make a home for your > husband and son. As your husband I compel you to do this. I'm tired of being > torn apart from my family. I'm sick and tired of having you run around with > other men all the time and not your husband. I love you, honey. \\"Come back'\\" he exhorted, \\"come back to our happy, happy home.\\" The image of a homebound husband longing for his congresswoman wife struck a chord in a time of rigidly defined gender roles. Knutson had considered addressing her dysfunctional marriage in public two years earlier, but had been dissuaded by her aides. Now it was coming back to hurt her. Her Republican opponent that fall, Odin Langen, ran on the slogan, \\"A Big Man for a Man-sized Job.\\" Still, Knutson only lost by a little over a thousand votes, the only Democratic incumbent to fail to win re-election to the House that year. She overwhelmingly carried Oklee and much of the northern part of the district, where people knew the truth about her marriage. =After Congress= Knutson divorced Andy shortly after failing to win re-election, and he died in 1969 of acute alcohol poisoning. She refused to attend his funeral. She tried to win her seat back in 1960, but lost. Shortly after that year's U.S. Census, the 9th District was re-configured, and re-numbered as the 7th. She went back to Washington and took a job as liaison officer in the United States Department of Defense's Office of Civil Defense, where she stayed until 1970. Knutson made one last attempt to regain office in 1977, but lost the 7th District's special election primary. Another woman would not be elected to Congress from Minnesota until Betty McCollum in 2000. In 2006, Amy Klobuchar became the first Minnesota woman elected to the U.S. Senate, and Michele Bachmann the first Republican woman from Minnesota elected to the U.S. House. Muriel Humphrey was appointed US Senator in 1978 after her husband US Senator Hubert Humphrey died. Legacy While Knutson is most commonly remembered as a feminist martyr, she also left her mark as a legislator. No bills she introduced were passed, but behind the scenes she played a significant role in passing legislation related to the federal Title II student loan program, school-lunch assistance and cystic fibrosis research. Many who served or worked in the House at the time recall that she was very effective at lobbying the leadership. In 1997 some members of the Minnesota legislature wanted to erect a memorial to her at the capitol building in St. Paul, but could not pass a bill appropriating the money. In her honor, the Minnesota YMCA Youth in Government program named its 11th and 12th grade model senate the \\"Knutson Senate.\\" In 2018, Minnesota Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith honored her with resolutions on her 106th birthday.

The general was beheaded and his remaining children have been exiled from China. As the children are being escorted to the western border of the Chinese empire, Tsao plots to have the children killed. Tsao's secret police lie in ambush at the desolate Dragon Gate Inn. Martial arts expert Hsiao shows up at the inn, wanting to meet the innkeeper. Unknown to the secret police is that the innkeeper, Wu Ning, was one of the general's lieutenants and has summoned Hsiao to help the children. A brother-sister martial-artist team (children of another Yu lieutenant) also show up to help. These four race to find Yu's children and lead them to safety. Production In 1965, director King Hu left the Hong Kong-based Shaw Brothers Studio just after completing Come Drink with Me. Hu left for Taiwan where he met with Sha Rongfeng. The two created the short-lived studio called the Union Film Company. Dragon Inn was shot in Taiwan in 1966. Release Dragon Inn premiered in 1967. Dragon Inn was first shown in North America at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. =Home media= Dragon Inn was released in the United Kingdom on Blu-ray and DVD by the Masters of Cinema Series. It was released in the United States on Blu-ray July 2018 by the Criterion Collection. Reception At the 1968 Golden Horse Awards, Dragon Inn won the award for Best Screenplay and was a runner-up for Best Director. Retrospective reception of the film in Taiwan is positive. In 2011, the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival had 122 industry professionals take part in the survey. This voters included film scholars, festival programmers, film directors, actors and producers to vote for the 100 Greatest Chinese-Language Films. Dragon Inn tied with Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love (2000) for ninth place on the list. In the United Kingdom, Empire gave the film four stars out five, referring to it as a \\"A keystone of the wuxia genre\\" and noted that the film \\"may lack plot complexity and period spectacle. But the stand-off in a remote inn is flecked with tension, wit and slick martial artistry.\\" Michael Brooke (Sight & Sound) referred to Dragon Inn as \\"one of the most important wuxia pian films to emerge from the Chinese- speaking world prior to the great martial arts boom of the turn of the 1970s.\\" and that it was \\"riotously entertaining\\". Brooks commented on the action scenes, opining that they \\"aren't quite as breath-catchingly dexterous as the ones Hong Kong cinema would later produce, they're both lively and agreeably frequent, with Hu using the Scope frame to its full advantage\\". Brooke concluded that \\"If it's not quite first-rank Hu when set against A Touch of Zen or The Fate of Lee Khan, it makes for a superb introduction.\\" The Radio Times gave the film a four out of five star rating, and felt the film surpassed Come Drink With Me, noting that Hu's \\"control over camera movement and composition is exemplary, building the tension and invigorating the swordplay.\\" =Box office= The film set box‚Äêoffice records in Taiwan, Korea, and the Philippines. The film was the second-highest grossing film in Hong Kong in 1968 behind You Only Live Twice. The Union Film Company did not make a great profit from the film however, as they had a deal with Shaw Brothers who owned the distribution rights to Dragon Inn in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Shaw Brothers had this deal as via an exchange that was done in trade for letting King Hu break his contract with them to work on Dragon Inn. Aftermath and influence Dragon Inn was remade twice, first as New Dragon Gate Inn (1992) and again in 2011 as Flying Swords of Dragon Gate. Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-Liang directed the critically acclaimed film Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003). The film is set in a decrepit Taipei movie theater on its final night in business which is screening Dragon Inn. The film's characters either watch the film very closely or are humorously distracted from it.

It is located in the Canberra suburb of Phillip. The town centre has a variety of shops and amenities, including office blocks that house Australian departments, and shopping centres like Westfield Woden. The Woden Valley itself was the first satellite city, separate from the Canberra Central district. Like Phillip, the town centre was established in 1966 and the suburb it is located in was named after Arthur Phillip, who was the first Governor of New South Wales. In 1971, a flash flood caused the deaths of seven people, which occurred right near the Woden Town Centre. The centre is the location of the tallest building in Canberra, the Lovett Tower (formerly known as the MLC Tower). History The Woden Town Centre was established in 1966, following when Phillip was gazetted on 12 May 1966. Like Phillip, except for Swinger Hill, street names in the Woden Town Centre are associated with the First, Second and Third Fleets. Construction began around 1968, when the Fishburn and Sirius buildings, along with the Alexander and Albemarle Buildings were among the first buildings to be built at the centre. On 26 January 1971, a flash flood occurred near the Woden Town Centre, where 95 mm of rain fell in one hour and killed seven people.Bureau of Meteorology \\"Facts on Flash Floods in NSW\\" The Woden Plaza was opened on 18 September 1972 by the then Prime Minister of Australia, William McMahon. =Revitalisation= Juliana House, now refurbished as a new apartment hotel Refurbishments for Scarborough House were considered in the 1990s, which were eventually done several years later. The existing Fishburn and Sirius Buildings were demolished in 2007-08 to make way for a new $67 million development housing some of the offices of the Department of Health and Ageing. The old Penrhyn House located at 2-6 Bowes Street was sold for $14 million in June 2012. The building, purchased by the boutique property fund manager went through a revamp, treated with a $10 million upgrade, which is expected to bring back 900 public servants to the Woden Town Centre, due to its sustainable space of 12,622 metres square. In 2014, the Juliana House was reopened by Abode Hotels as a hotel, where the office tower, which once housed the Commonwealth Health and Ageing offices, was closed down and left vacant in 2010. The conversion of the building resulted in the withdrawal of 8,500 square metres of space from the ACT property market. The Alexander and Albemarle buildings are set for demolition to make way for a new development plan. In 2013, a new bus layover has been proposed at the locations of Phillip Oval and the corner of Launceston and Callam Street. This is to improve the flow and efficiency of transportation in the town centre. \\"Block 13\\" mentioned in this plan is a desirable site for a new bus layover in the Woden Town Centre. This brings opportunity for the Phillip Oval, for future use and its increase of importance for second tier ground for Cricket and AFL. An Estate Development Plan was approved for the Woden Town Centre in November 2013. The Woden Town Centre revamp is similar to what happened with the redevelopment at the Belconnen Town Centre, which the redevelopment there resulted in significant urban design improvements. A redevelopment on the Woden Interchange had been considered since 2004, where plans introduced Westfield Woden's development team and its co-owners proposals to upgrade. In 2014, work has been confirmed to begin as early as September, where the former police station next to the interchange is expected to be demolished to make way for new redevelopment. The redevelopment also includes demolishing the existing interchange in replacement for a new building. However, department store chain, Myer has stated they will not have an outlet located in Woden, resulting in some doubts of revitalisation. Geology and location The rocks underneath Phillip are from the Silurian period and are from 417 to 414 million years old. Deakin Volcanics green-grey purple coloured rhyodacite can be found in the west half and south east corner of Phillip. Deakin Volcanics purple and green tuff has been observed around Hindmarsh Drive.Gardner, D.E. ( 1974 ): Geological observations at several construction sites, at Canberra (Northside) and Phillip, ACT 1967-68. Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics. The Woden Town Centre is located in Phillip which is in the district of the Woden Valley. The postcode is 2606. The Woden Town Centre neighbours the suburbs of Lyons from the north west, Chifley directly from the west and Pearce from south west, Curtin from north, Hughes from the north east, Garran directly from the east and O'Malley from south east, while Mawson borders from the south. Urban structure Westfield Woden from the southeast The main shopping centre of Woden Town Centre is Westfield Woden, formerly called 'Woden Plaza' and 'Woden Shopping Square'. Westfield Woden includes major supermarkets (Woolworths and Coles), department stores such as David Jones and Big W, Hoyts cinemas and many other stores on several levels. Separate buildings house multi-storey car parks. Westfield Woden is intended to increase in size due to a redevelopment plan to improve the town centre. The Woden Town Centre is home to Headquarters for the Department of Veterans Affairs and IP Australia , located at the Discovery House, and the Department of Health is located in the new Sirius Building and Scarborough House building (14 stories and the second tallest office building in Canberra), both are located on Furzer and Atlantic Street. A police station is located in the town centre, but moved from an older station next to the bus interchange, which is scheduled for demolition in September 2014. The tallest commercial building in Canberra, the 26 story 93 metre (305 ft) high Lovett Tower is located on Keltie Street. The tower was formerly known as the MLC Tower, but it was renamed in 2000 to honour the Lovett family. It has been the tallest building in Canberra since its completion in 1973. The Tower is currently occupied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Alexander and Albemarle Buildings once housed the Department of Health and Ageing as its central office until its closure in 2010, where they are now scheduled for demolition. Aviation House in Woden The Woden Town Park is located across Callam street, although infrequently used because of its location away from the major shopping areas. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has its headquarters at the Aviation House, which is adjacent to the Sirius Building. The Juliana House now serves as an apartment of hotel, after four years of being vacant. The Bonner House in Neptune street headquarters the Indigenous Business Australia. The town centre has a postal office and a health centre. A Medibank branch is headquartered in Woden, which is next to the bus interchange. SkyPlaza is located in Woden, and is one of the tallest residential buildings in Canberra, where it is 60 m (197 ft) in height, 20 floors, and was completed in 2005. The Woden Bus Interchange provides transport for people from one place to another, but the interchange has been scheduled for demolition, and the area also surrounding the interchange has been planned for new redevelopments to improve the town centre. A redevelopment master plan for this was first considered back in 2004, but actual development will be taking place in September 2014. The Phillip Ice Skating Centre was the home arena for the Canberra Knights, until 2014. =Education= Just outside the Woden Town Centre is the Phillip campus of the Canberra College, a secondary school catering to years 11 and 12 (16 ‚Äì 18 years old). The town centre also has a local library which is located on Corinna Street.

It may be used alone or together with hemodialysis. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, nausea, sleepiness, and unsteadiness. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Fomepizole works by blocking the enzyme that converts methanol and ethylene glycol to their toxic breakdown products. Fomepizole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical use Fomepizole is used in ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning. It acts to inhibit the breakdown of these toxins into their active toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, found in the liver. This enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of ethylene glycol, and of methanol. * Ethylene glycol is first metabolized to glycolaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycolaldehyde then undergoes further oxidation to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are the primary toxins responsible for the metabolic acidosis, and for the renal damage, seen in ethylene glycol poisoning. * Methanol is first metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde then undergoes further oxidation, via formaldehyde dehydrogenase, to become formic acid. Formic acid is the primary toxin responsible for the metabolic acidosis, and for the visual disturbances, associated with methanol poisoning. By competitively inhibiting the first enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol, fomepizole slows the production of the toxic metabolites. The slower rate of metabolite production allows the liver to process and excrete the metabolites as they are produced, limiting the accumulation in tissues such as the kidney and eye. As a result, much of the organ damage is avoided. Fomepizole is most effective when given soon after ingestion of ethylene glycol or methanol. Delaying its administration allows for the generation of harmful metabolites. =Interaction with alcohol= Concurrent use with ethanol is contraindicated because fomepizole is known to prolong the half-life of ethanol via inhibiting its metabolism. Extending the half-life of ethanol may increase and extend the intoxicating effects of ethanol, allowing for greater (potentially dangerous) levels of intoxication at lower doses. Fomepizole slows the production of acetaldehyde by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, which in turn allows more time to further convert acetaldehyde into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The result is a patient with a prolonged and deeper level of intoxication for any given dose of ethanol, and reduced \\"hangover\\" symptoms (since these adverse symptoms are largely mediated by acetaldehyde build up). In a chronic alcoholic who has built up a tolerance to ethanol, this removes some of the disincentives to ethanol consumption (\\"negative reinforcement\\") while allowing them to become intoxicated with a lower dose of ethanol. The danger is that the alcoholic will then overdose on ethanol (possibly fatally). If alcoholics instead very carefully reduce their doses to reflect the now slower metabolism, they may get the \\"rewarding\\" stimulus of intoxication at lower doses with less adverse \\"hangover\\" effects - leading potentially to increased psychological dependency. However, these lower doses may therefore produce less chronic toxicity and provide a harm minimization approach to chronic alcoholism. It is, in essence, the antithesis of a disulfiram approach which tries to increase the buildup of acetaldehyde resulting in positive punishment for the patient. Compliance, and adherence, is a substantial problem in disulfiram- based approaches. Disulfiram also has a considerably longer half-life than that of fomepizole, requiring the person to not drink ethanol in order to avoid severe effects. If the person is not adequately managed on a benzodiazepine, barbiturate, acamprosate, or another GABAA receptor agonist, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and its attendant, life-threatening risk of delirium tremens \\"DT\\", may occur. Disulfiram treatment should never be initiated until the risk of DT has been evaluated, and mitigated appropriately. Fomepizole treatment may be initiated while the DT de-titration sequence is still being calibrated based upon the person's withdrawal symptoms and psychological health. Adverse effects Common side effects associated with fomepizole use include headache and nausea. Kinetics =Absorption and distribution= Fomepizole distributes rapidly into total body water. The volume of distribution is between 0.6 and 1.02 l/kg. The therapeutic concentration is from 8.2 to 24.6 mg (100 to 300 micromoles) per liter. Peak concentration following single oral doses of 7 to 50 mg/kg of body weight occurred in 1 to 2 hours. The half-life varies with dose, so has not been calculated. =Metabolism and elimination= Hepatic; the primary metabolite is 4-carboxypyrazole (about 80 to 85% of an administered dose). Other metabolites include the pyrazoles 4-hydroxymethylpyrazole and the N -glucuronide conjugates of 4-carboxypyrazole and 4-hydroxymethylpyrazole. Following multiple doses, fomepizole rapidly induces its own metabolism via the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system. In healthy volunteers, 1.0 to 3.5% of an administered dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolites also are excreted unchanged in the urine. Fomepizole is dialyzable. Other uses Apart from medical uses, the role of 4-methylpyrazole in coordination chemistry has been studied.

Worth, Texas from 1876-1879. In 1887, he was killed in a shootout with gambler and gunfighter Luke Short. Before his death, people feared Courtright's reputation as a gunman, and he successfully reduced Ft. Worth's murder rate by more than half, while reportedly extracting protection money from town business owners.  Early life  Courtright was born in Sangamon County, Illinois in the spring of 1848, the son of Daniel Courtright. He had four older sisters and one younger brother. He was reported to have practiced shooting frequently. Allegedly He lied about his age and enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He served under General John A. Logan for whom he once took a bullet and thus earned Logan's admiration. See remarks on his alleged service at He was rootless and traveled around often until he finally settled in Fort Worth in north Texas. While in Fort Worth, Courtright was at various times a jailer, city marshal, deputy sheriff, deputy U.S. Marshal, hired killer, private detective, and racketeer. During his travels, Courtright had developed a reputation as being fast with a gun. He married Sarah Weeks and taught her how to shoot. They held shooting exhibitions for which they charged admission, and later performed as part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.  Lawman career  Courtright and his wife arrived in Ft. Worth in 1876. He ran for office as the first elected city marshal against four other men, and won by three votes. He liked to wear his hair long and wore two revolvers with their butts facing forward. He became known for his long hair and his reputation for using his badge as a convenience. As marshal, he was in charge of keeping the peace in the notorious \\"Hells Half Acre\\" (the town's red-light district). At that time, Fort Worth was a very dangerous place, with altercations between unruly drunks and lawmen being commonplace. Few people dared to cross him, and he killed several who did. On August 25, 1877, Deputy Marshal Columbus Fitzgerald was shot and killed while attempting to break up a street fight. Courtright shot and killed the suspect that same night. During his tenure as Ft. Worth Marshal, it's reported that he killed at least four other men during altercations and shootouts.fortworthpd.com: FWPD History It was generally believed that he murdered several unwilling business owners who would not pay into his protection racket. Most met his demand to avoid the risk of becoming the target of his anger and gun. Some who declined were killed, and those who survived usually made the payments demanded. = Life after Ft. Worth = He served as Ft. Worth's Marshal until 1879, when he lost his third election. He left his family behind, he moved to New Mexico and obtained appointment as the Marshal of Lake Valley, and after that as a hired guard for a mining operation. Sometime later, while working as a ranch foreman, he and his friend Jim McIntire shot and killed two squatters who had refused to leave the ranch. = American Valley murders = In 1883, his former Civil War commander John A. Logan was interested in purchasing the American Valley Cattle Company in New Mexico. The company controlled a vast tract of land about wide. Maintaining that he was concerned about ongoing cattle rustling that was decimating herds, U.S. Marshal A. L. Morisson invited his deputies Courtright and Jim McIntire to help secure the land. But the current owner John P. Casey and his partners W. C. Moore and Henry M. Atkison had bigger ambitions: they wanted ownership of an additional acres with water rights that would allow them to gain control of an additional of quality grazing land. They had already forced about 90 residents of the small community of Rito off their land. But Alexis Grossetete and Robert Elsinger, partners in a ranch at Gallo Springs were resistant to Moore's threats. They had claimed their land under preemption rights that guaranteed settlers the right to file a patent on unsurveyed land. Both had brought their families onto the land and made it evident they intended to stay. Casey accused them of being squatters and was determined to evict them. Casey's partner W. C. Moore had a dark past. He was hired by D. T. Beals and W. H. Bates, owners of the LX Ranch in the Texas Panhandle, to manage a large herd. He started in 1877 but during 1881 they discovered that he was siphoning off a good portion of the stock for his own herd and they fired him. Moore sold his Adobe Walls Ranch for $75,000 (or about $ million in today's dollars) and used $25,000 of the proceeds to buy a one-third interest in Casey's American Valley Cattle Company. Courtwright may have initially believed he was only hired to pursue cattle rustlers. He was told by Moore that they were pursuing a former employee of Casey's named D. L. Gilmore near Socorro, New Mexico. Moore led the posse directly to the ranch headquarters in American Valley and the next day they looked for Gilmore's cowboys, ending the day at a line cabin about from Grossetete's and Elsinger's homes. The next day Moore took five of the posse and rode towards their homes. Moore told the party that their job was to get rid of the two \\"squatters.\\" He said all six would fire into their bodies so all six would be equally guilty. They found the men, took their weapons, marched them to a narrow ravine, and killed them both. Daniel H. McAllister, a Deacon in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had been until a few days before the manager of Casey's ranch. When he learned of the murders, he informed the authorities, who promptly called for Moore and his fellow posse members' arrest. Courtwright and McIntire initially acted as lawmen and arrested the others who had taken part in the murders, but when the grand jury convened, they learned that the two men had also taken part. Moore escaped arrest, and before Courtwright and McIntire could be apprehended, they took off for Mexico on horseback, finally ending up on June 1 in El Paso, Texas, where they found safety among a number of former Texas Rangers who knew them both. Courtwright sent for his wife and children who had been in Los Angeles. McIntire also summoned his wife and the two families headed to Ft. Worth, where they successfully fought extradition to New Mexico, claiming the two men were \\"Mexicans\\" and they had been performing their duties as lawmen.  Forms detective agency  Secure in Ft. Worth, in 1884 Courtwright tried once again to form a detective agency. In New Mexico, two men were tried and acquitted of the murders, and authorities renewed their effort to bring Courtwright to justice.  Courtright vs Short  Luke Short was a gunfighter, gambler and bar owner who had drifted down to Fort Worth from Dodge City, Kansas. While in Dodge City, Short had dabbled in gambling, and became friends with several other noted Old West figures, such as Bat Masterson, Jim Masterson and Wyatt Earp, who had also become friends with Courtright. In Fort Worth, he managed the White Elephant, a saloon/gambling house. Marshal Courtright was running a protection racket at the time, and needed to make an example of Short, who also had a sizable reputation as a gunfighter mostly due to an 1881 gunfight with gunslinger Charlie Storms at the Oriental Saloon in Tombstone, Arizona. Most historians believe that Courtright offered protection to the White Elephant and that Short informed him that he did not need his protection. On February 8, 1887, at about 8:00 p.m., Courtright called out Luke Short, carrying a pair of pistols, and challenging him to come out of the White Elephant, but a friend Jake Johnson managed to calm him down and told him that they should talk about the affair instead. In Short's own accounts, both men walked up the street one block, until they were in front of bar and brothel owner Ella Blackwell's Shooting Gallery, the two men facing one another three to four feet apart.Tarrant County Historical Journal‚ÄîBad BloodDeArment, Robert K. Jim Courtright of Fort Worth: His Life and Legend . Texas Christian University Press; First edition (August 4, 2004). pp.226-227. Words were passed, and evidently Courtright, who had been drinking considerably, had made some indication about Short having a gun. Short assured Courtright he was not armed, although he was. Courtright then said loudly \\"Don't you pull a gun on me.\\" With that statement, Courtright drew his pistol and in that second Short produced his pistol and fired one shot, which took off Courtright's thumb on his shooting hand. As Courtright attempted to shift his pistol to his other hand, Short fired four more shots in quick succession. Courtright fell backward and died shortly thereafter. The showdown was also witnessed by fellow gunfighter Bat Masterson, who was with Luke Short at that time.Luke Short - A Dandy Gunfighter by W.R. (Bat) Masterson in 1907 In 1907 Masterson published his own, more neutral account of the events that unfold, in which he stated that it was Jim Courtright, who called for Luke Short to meet him in the street for a confrontation, while carrying a \\"brace of pistols\\" of his own. Masterson described what followed: Courtright was shot three times: Once in the thumb; once in the right shoulder, and once in the heart.Fort Worth Gazette February 11, 1887 .p.3 Investigations on the gunfight concluded that while it was Courtright who went for his pistol first, it was Short who ultimately outdrew and killed him. Courtright's inability to fire off a shot was due to a number of possible scenarios; one was that his pistol got caught on his watch chain for a second as he drew it, and another was that his pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.DeArment, Robert K. Jim Courtright of Fort Worth: His Life and Legend. Texas Christian University Press; First edition (August 4, 2004). p. 234. Another is that Courtright's .45 Colt in his right hand had jammed because a bullet prevented the gun chamber from moving.Fort Worth Gazette February 11,1887 .p.3  Aftermath and legacy  Short was tried for the shooting, but it was ruled justified self defense, and the charges were dismissed. The gunfight gained notoriety due to the reputation of both men. Unfortunately for Courtright, that fame was posthumous.tchj.com Bad Blood Despite Courtright's reputation for strong- arming local businesses with his protection service, he did reduce Fort Worth's murder rate by more than half the previous level during his time there as the marshal. He built a small force that included himself and two deputies which eventually grew into today's Fort Worth police force.  Film portrayals  In 1955, the half-hour syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, aired the Jim Courtright story, with Robert Knapp in the title role and Wally Cassell as Luke Short. In 1958, Karl Swenson was cast in an historically inaccurate portrayal of Courtright on the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, Colt .45, starring Wayde Preston. In the episode entitled \\"Long Odds\\", Swenson plays a grandfather visiting his 10-year-old grandson Billy, played by child actor Paul Engle. Billy has told his friends of his grandfather's prowess with a gun, but the elderly Courtright now shuns a confrontation with the gunfighter Cherry Lane, played by Robert J. Wilke, amid accusations of cowardice. The real Courtright was dead at thirty-nine and likely had no grandchildren. In the Colt .45 episode, Swenson was fifty when he portrayed Courtright.

It was released as Dragon Inn in North America. The film is a remake of Dragon Gate Inn (1967). New Dragon Gate Inn was shot as a standard wuxia action thriller, with fast-paced action including martial arts, sword fighting and black comedy set in ancient China. Plot This is a period film set during the Ming Dynasty in the desert region of China. Tsao Siu-yan is a power-crazed eunuch who rules his sector of China as if he were the Emperor and not a mere official. He is the leader of the Emperor's ruthless security agency known as the Eastern Depot (Êù±Âª† Dong Chang). He has built up an elite army of skilled archers and horsemen who receive intensive training and powerful weapons. When elements of his administration plot against him and his despotic rule, Tsao comes down ruthlessly. One such plotter is defence minister Yang Yu-xuan, who is executed along with his family. Tsao does spare two of the younger children and instead sentences them to exile in order to lure Yang's subordinate general Chow Wai-on into a trap. Escorted by a couple of rather poorly East Factory soldiers, the children are sent out into the desert. Rebels, led by Chow's lover, swordswoman Yau Mo-yan, arrive to free them, but are attacked by East Factory troops. Tsao later calls off the attack when he realises that Chow is not among the fighters, and instead orders his troops to pursue them to find where they will be meeting with Chow. The rebels and the children then proceed to the Dragon Gate Pass through which they will cross the border. They reach the Dragon Gate Inn, which is a meeting place run by brigands. The innkeeper, the lively Jade, runs a sideline in which she seduces and murders her guests. Jade also keeps whatever money the customer has, then drops them down a chute to the kitchen and have them served as the meat in buns. The cutting up is done by her cook Dao, an expert at stripping meat to the bones. Mo-yan and her followers arrive at the inn. She is disguised as a man, but Jade is not fooled, claiming that only a woman would pass her without so much as a glance. That night she confronts Mo-yan and the pair engage in a lively acrobatic fight with both women trying to remain clothed, while stripping the other. Rebel leader Chow arrives and is re-united with Mo-yan. They plan to cross the border with the children but the bad weather delays their departure. Furthermore, Jade takes a liking to Chow and resolves to get him for herself, also has in mind the reward offered for his capture. Things are made even more complicated when East Factory officials led by Cha arrive at the inn posing as merchants. The scene is set for a vicious battle of bodies and wits between both sides, with Jade trying to keep the peace and getting every advantage, monetary or otherwise, that she can get out of it. Meanwhile, the bulk of the East Factory forces, led by eunuch Tsao himself, are on their way to the inn. Chow believes that, like most den of thieves, the inn has a secret passage through which his comrades can escape. Jade agrees to show them the passage if Chow will sleep with her. He agrees if they marry first. Jade, a practical girl, is rather surprised at having to marry for a one-night stand but proceeds anyway, with Cha acting as host for the wedding. The heart-broken Mo-yan drowns her sorrows in drink. The growing tension inside the inn breaks out into open battle when Cha and his men realise that the rebels want to use the secret passage to escape. The fight that follows results in the deaths of all the Dong Chang at the inn and most of the rebels and brigand hosts. Mo-yan herself is seriously injured. Tsao and his army arrives and lays siege to the inn. Inside there is only a handful of survivors: Jade, Chow, Mo-yan, Dao the cook, and the children. They escape through the passage, but a loose ribbon gives them away and Tsao himself sets off in pursuit. A vicious one-on-three battle amidst a desert storm as Tsao fights Jade, Chow and Mo-yan. Weakened by her wounds, Mo- yan perishes in quicksand. Just as Tsao is about to finish off Jade and Chow, Dao suddenly appears and takes him on with his carving knife. He carves away at Tsao, leaving the warlord with a skeletal arm and leg. Chow then moves in for the kill and Tsao is finished. Chow and the children make their way to the border. Realising how much Chow meant to her, Jade and Dao decide to follow Chow after burning down the infamous inn.

Savonlinna Opera Festival () is held annually in the city of Savonlinna in Finland. The Festival takes place at the medieval Olavinlinna (St. Olaf's Castle), built in 1475. The castle is located amid spectacular lake scenery.  Origin  The birth of the Savonlinna Opera Festival ties in closely with the emerging Finnish identity and striving for independence at the beginning of the 20th century. Attending a nationalist meeting in Olavinlinna Castle in 1907, the Finnish soprano Aino Ackt√©, already famous at opera houses the world over and an ardent patriot, immediately spotted the potential of the castle as the venue for an opera festival. The first opera festival was held in 1912. Aino Ackt√© directed the festival for five summers, staging four Finnish operas. The only opera by a non-Finnish composer was Charles Gounod‚Äôs Faust, with Ackt√© herself in the leading female role of Marguerite. In 1917 the festival ran into difficulties because of First World War, Finnish Declaration of Independence and the ensuing Finnish Civil War. For fifty years, the opera festival was dormant, but in 1967, Savonlinna Music Days decided to organise an opera course for young singers. The high point of the course was a performance of Beethoven's Fidelio in the castle. Therefore, 1967 is nowadays regarded as the start of the present Festival; since then it has had steady growth of both audience and reputation.  Present-day festival  The stage at the courtyard of St. Olaf's Castle. The Savonlinna Opera Festival has grown into an internationally recognised festival lasting a month. Each year it performs to a total audience of around 60,000, an estimated quarter of whom come from abroad. Each year the Festival has, in addition to staging leading works from classical operatic repertoire, staged its own productions. = Premieres = Thirteen operas have been premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival since 1967: The Horseman (1975), The King Goes Forth to France (1984, commissioned jointly by Covent Garden and the BBC), and The Palace (1995) by Aulis Sallinen, The Knife (1989) by Paavo Heininen, Aleksis Kivi (1997) by Einojuhani Rautavaara, The Age of Dreams (2000‚Äì2001) by Herman Rechberger, Olli Kortekangas and Kalevi Aho, Koirien Kalevala (2004) by Jaakko Kuusisto, Hui kauhistus (2006) by Jukka Linkola, Is√§n tytt√∂ (2007) by Olli Kortekangas, Seitsem√§n koiraveljest√§ (2008) by Markus Fagerudd, La Fenice (2012) by Kimmo Hakola, Norppaooppera (2013) by Timo-Juhani Kyll√∂nen, and Linna vedess√§ (2017) by Aulis Sallinen. = Visits by foreign opera companies = For over a decade, the Savonlinna Opera Festival has hosted foreign opera companies: The first of these was the Estonia Theatre from Tallinn. This was followed for the next three seasons by the world-famous Mariinsky (Kirov) Theatre from St. Petersburg, by Covent Garden from London in 1998, the Op√©ra national du Rhin from Strasbourg in 1999, the New Israeli Opera in 2000, Los Angeles Opera in 2001, the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in 2002, and the Choir and Orchestra of the Municipal Theatre of Santiago in 2003, with a staging of Sergio Ortega's Fulgor y Muerte de Joaqu√≠n Murieta, after a libretto by Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda. The Welsh National Opera (UK) performed Nabucco and Manon Lescaut at the festival in 2014. *List of opera festivals See also *List of opera festivals References  External links  * * Savonlinna Opera Festival Category:Music festivals in Finland Category:Opera festivals Opera Festival Category:Tourist attractions in South Savo Category:Recurring events established in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Finland Category:1912 in the arts Category:Recurring events established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Finland Category:1967 in the arts ","title":"Savonlinna Opera Festival"},{"id":"2533717","text":"St George's School is a Catholic school in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. St George's school was opened in the year 1937 and was named after Saint George. History Fr. Piet de Wit was appointed as a resident priest in Brunei Town in 1937 to assist Fr. Arthur Crowther, MHM, who was the first resident priest in Brunei. Fr. Piet de Wit started the first Catholic school in a rented house owned by Mr. Kay in Jalan Padang, which also housed a chapel and the living quarters of the priest. By 1941, a building to house the activities of the church had been constructed at Kumbang Pasang on the land donated by Mr. George Newn Ah Foott. The school building by this time included a small chapel and living quarters for the resident priest. The priest was also the principal of the school. During the Japanese Occupation of 1942-45, de Wit together with the other priests were interned by the Japanese and sent to Batu Lintang camp in Kuching. The Japanese authorities used the church for their activities while the Catholics used the school building for their services. After the war, the school was re-established and managed by Mr. George Newn Ah Foott with his daughters as the teachers. The Mill Hill Missionary priests continued to come to Brunei from Labuan, such as Fr. McCarthy, Fr. Ben Walsh and Fr. William Smit. It was Smit who gave the school the name St. George‚Äôs School, after its founder and benefactor. In 1953, Fr. Delaney was appointed as the resident priest. He was instrumental in constructing many buildings. He extended the school and constructed a new church. This building later became the Parish Hall. Delaney single-handedly taught the twelve Form One students in 1963. The school building was rebuilt 1963. Fr. Conway was appointed to St. George‚Äôs School from July 1964 to June 1965. Mrs. Paula Mah started teaching at St. George‚Äôs School in January 1964. She was in charge of the Form Two students. It was also the time when the school uniforms patterns were chosen by the students and permission was granted by Fr. Conway. He was followed by Fr. Wolbers, who was appointed as Acting Rector and School Principal in September 1966. He also made the school uniform official. The twelve students sat for the Sarawak Junior Exams in 1965 and scored 100% passes. This excellent performance was published in the Borneo Bulletin. By January 1969, Fr. Jan Dekker was sent as temporary replacement when Fr. Wolbers left. During this period, Bishop Galvin appointed a layman, Mr. Guy Alwines, as Principal of St. George‚Äôs School. Fr. Paul Tong was appointed Rector in August 1969. He was followed by Fr. Francis de Vries in 1970 and by Fr. Thomas Keogan. Fr. Jan Heuschen managed the school from 1972 and took over from Fr. Keogan who left in 1978. After working in Brunei for thirteen years, Fr. Jan Heuschen left in October 1984. Fr. Dunne took over for a short while until Fr. Peter Chiang was transferred to Bandar Seri Begawan from the Seria Parish. In 1991 Fr. Chiang and Fr. McClorey had to leave Brunei. The departure of the last two foreign priests was a time of great trial with the burden of responsibility falling into the hands of the single local priest, Bishop Cornelius Sim.

The wing is primarily stationed at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, but maintains one of its groups and associated squadrons at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona as a geographically separated unit. The 55 WG is the only Air Force wing with continuous operations, maintenance, and aircraft presence in the United States Central Command area of responsibility since Operation Desert Storm. The wing's mission is to provide worldwide reconnaissance, real- time intelligence, command and control, information warfare and combat support to U.S. leaders and commanders. One of the wing's units, the 55th Operations Group, operates 46 aircraft, including 13 models of seven different types. It is the largest wing in Air Combat Command and flies the most diverse number of aircraft. History : For additional history and lineage, see 55th Operations Group The \\"Fightin' Fifty-Fifth\\" has made significant contributions to the defense of the United States of America for more than 50 years. Since its inception, the unit has operated around the world, flying a wide variety of aircraft. =Cold War= On 1 November 1950, the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (55 SRW) was activated under the Wing Base Organization at Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico as the headquarters for the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Group and its supporting units. From 1950 to 1954 the Wing's task was to perform strategic reconnaissance, charting photography, precise electronic geodetic mapping, and electronic reconnaissance missions. In 1952, the wing moved to Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas and converted to Boeing RB-50 Superfortresses. On 13 March 1953, a wing RB-50 flying out of Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska was attacked by Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters near Siberia, but was able to ward off the fighter's attack with defensive fire. The United States protested the attack, stating the plane was on a weather reconnaissance flight over international waters, 25 miles from the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Soviets responded by saying the plane was intercepted over their territory near Cape Krestovoi. A little more than three months later, on 29 July 1953 an RB-50 of the wing's 343d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron was shot down by Soviet fighters about ninety miles south of Vladivostok.The plane was temporarily attached to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron for the mission. Farquhar, p. 46 The Soviet Union did not deny the plane's location was over water, but claimed that the bomber had twice flown over Soviet territory and fired on their MiGs, who then returned fire defensively.Farquhar, pp. 45-47 The wing formally assumed a global strategic reconnaissance mission in 1954 and transitioned to the RB-47E \\"Stratojet.\\" The Wing was deployed at Ben Guerir Air Base, in what was then French Morocco, between May and August 1955. When the mapping and charting functions originally assigned to the 55th Reconnaissance Group were transferred on 1 May 1954, the wing assumed the mission of global strategic reconnaissance, including electronic reconnaissance. It also carried out weather reconnaissance operations until June 1963, and photographic reconnaissance missions until May 1964. The 55 SRW moved to Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, in August 1966. That same year the 55th's 38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron assumed responsibility for SAC's airborne command and control system. The 2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron inherited this mission after activation in April 1970. The 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron, flying E-4A aircraft, transferred to the 55th on 1 November 1975, bringing with it the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, now called the National Airborne Operations Center. The Wing flew reconnaissance operations during the U.S. military operations in Grenada in 1983 and Libya in 1986. On 1 March 1986, the 55 SRW became the host unit at Offutt after the inactivation of the 3902d Air Base Wing. The Wing ended nearly twenty-five years of continuous Airborne Command Post ('Looking Glass') operations in 1990, assumed a modified alert posture, and continued worldwide reconnaissance. In October 1998, the wing transferred control of the EC-135 LOOKING GLASS mission to the United States Navy's TACAMO aircraft and the 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron, which flew the EC-135 LOOKING GLASS aircraft, inactivated. The wing deployed a Rivet Joint RC-135 from Hellenikon Air Base, Greece to Riyadh Air Base, Saudi Arabia on 8 August 1990, and began 24-hour-a-day reconnaissance of the region two days later for Central Command Commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, under Operation Desert Shield. At the start of Operation Desert Storm, 18 January 1991, the wing continued to provide real-time information. In 1996, this operation moved to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia. On 9 August 2015, the wing celebrated 25 years of what is believed to be the longest continuous deployment by an Air Force unit. =Current operations= The 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing became the 55th Wing on 1 September 1991, to reflect the wing's performance of a diversity of missions. When SAC disestablished and Air Combat Command (ACC) established, the wing transferred to ACC and gained its fifth operational location. The 55th SRW and the 55th Wing has been awarded the USAF's P. T. Cullen Award five times since 1971 for its contributions to photo and signal intelligence collection. Aircraft and crews from the unit have at times temporarily relocated to the nearby Lincoln Air National Guard Base when Offutt's runway has been closed for repairs.  Mission  WC-135W Constant PhoenixThe 55th Operations Group is Air Combat Command's largest group, has operational control over 12 squadrons and two detachments worldwide. It employs 46 aircraft, including 13 models of seven different types. The 55th Communications Group provides worldwide command, control, communications and computer (C4) systems, information management and combat support to war-fighting and national leadership.

Born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Wilson moved to Adelaide to attend the Australian Cricket Academy, and went to debut for South Australia during the 1995‚Äì96 season. A solidly-built right-arm fast bowler, all of his matches at international level came during the 1997‚Äì98 season, with his single Test coming during Australia's tour of India. Wilson remained active at domestic level until the early 2000s, switching to Western Australia for the 2002‚Äì03 season. Retiring at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, for a time he served as the coach of the Western Fury in the Women's National Cricket League. Wilson later became an umpire, and currently sits on Cricket Australia's national umpires panel. Playing career =Early cricket= Wilson left a trainee accountant job in Newcastle to travel to Adelaide, where he requested a place at the Australian Cricket Academy. =South Australia= He emerged late in 1993‚Äì94 to make his debut for South Australia. He played 51 first-class games in all, taking 151 wickets at a healthy average of 30.77. =Western Australia= In 2002 he moved to Western Australia where has contracted by the Western Warriors. He played two seasons for the Warriors, retiring at the end of the 2003‚Äì2004 season. =International cricket= After a stint in the 'A' side, Wilson was promoted to the Australian side. He played one Test Match, against India, in Kolkata, India, in March 1998, but had the unfortunate record of having scored neither a run, nor taken a wicket, after he limped off injured in the early stages of the game. He did not represent Australia again. Before that, he had a short spell as a bowler in the ODI team, playing in 11 games, all in the 1997‚Äì98 Australian season. Coaching After retiring he served as Western Fury coach. Umpiring Wilson is currently an umpire on the Cricket Australia Project Umpire's Panel. He stood in two Twenty20 International games in 2014. He stood in his first One Day International match on 8 November 2014 between Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea in Australia. In January 2018, he was named as one of the seventeen on-field umpires for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. In April 2019, he was named as one of the sixteen umpires to stand in matches during the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In September 2019, in the one-off match between Bangladesh and Afghanistan, Wilson stood in his first Test match.

By contrast, an out-group is a social group with which an individual does not identify. People may for example identify with their peer group, family, community, sports team, political party, gender, religion, or nation. It has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena. The terminology was made popular by Henri Tajfel and colleagues during his work in formulating social identity theory. The significance of in-group and out-group categorization was identified using a method called the minimal group paradigm. Tajfel and colleagues found that people can form self-preferencing in-groups within a matter of minutes and that such groups can form even on the basis of completely arbitrary and invented discriminatory characteristics, such as preferences for certain paintings.See \\"Kandinsky versus Klee experiment\\", Tajfel et al. (1971) in Tajfel, H. (1970). Experiments in Intergroup Discrimination. Associated phenomena The psychological categorization of people into in-group and out- group members is associated with a variety of phenomena. The following examples have all received a great deal of academic attention. =In-group favoritism= This refers to the fact that under certain conditions, people will prefer and have affinity for one's in-group over the out-group, or anyone viewed as outside the in-group. This can be expressed in one's evaluation of others, linking, allocation of resources, and many other ways. =Out-group derogation= Discrimination between in-groups and out-groups is a matter of favoritism towards an in-group and the absence of equivalent favoritism towards an out-group. Out-group derogation is the phenomenon in which an out- group is perceived as being threatening to the members of an in-group. This phenomenon often accompanies in-group favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their in-group. Some research suggests that out-group derogation occurs when an out-group is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an in-group. It has also been argued that out-group derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process. =Social influence= People have been shown to be differentially influenced by in-group members. That is, under conditions where group categorization is psychologically salient, people will shift their beliefs in line with in-group social norms. =Group polarization= This generally refers to the tendency of groups to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members, although polarization toward the most central beliefs has also been observed. It has been shown that this effect is related to a psychologically salient in-group and outgroup categorization. =Group homogeneity= Categorization of people into social groups increases the perception that group members are similar to one another. An outcome of this is the out-group homogeneity effect. This refers to the perception of members of an out-group as being homogenous, while members of one's in-group are perceived as being diverse, e.g. \\"they are alike; we are diverse‚Äù. This is especially likely to occur in regard to negative characteristics. Under certain conditions, in- group members can be perceived as being similar to one another in regard to positive characteristics. This effect is called in-group homogeneity. Postulated role in human evolution In evolutionary psychology, in-group favoritism is seen as an evolved mechanism selected for the advantages of coalition affiliation. It has been argued that characteristics such as gender and ethnicity are inflexible or even essential features of such systems. However, there is evidence that elements of favoritism are flexible in that they can be erased by changes in social categorization. One study in the field of behavioural genetics suggests that biological mechanisms may exist which favor a coexistence of both flexible and essentialist systems.

Background Rudolf was born in Limburg an der Lahn, Hesse. In 1983 he took his Abitur in Remscheid, then studied chemistry in Bonn, graduating in 1989 with a master's degree. As a student, he joined the A.V. Tuisconia K√∂nigsberg zu Bonn and the K.D.St.V. Nordgau Prag zu Stuttgart, Catholic fraternities belonging to the Cartellverband. After supporting the CSU/CDU, he became a member of the Republicans.A Rebel at germarrudolf.com, accessed 27 October 2015 After his military service with the German Air Force, in October 1990 he joined the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research at Stuttgart, where he prepared a PhD thesis. In 1991, Rudolf began work on a paper entitled Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz \\"gas chambers\\" on behalf of the D√ºsseldorf attorney Hajo Herrmann, a former Luftwaffe pilot. In 1993, this work was reported in the media, and Rudolf was told not to enter the Max Planck Institute again without permission. When he did so, his employment was terminated without notice. In 1994, this dismissal was converted into a termination by mutual agreement. In 1996, the University of Stuttgart asked Rudolf to withdraw his application for a final PhD examination, or it would be denied, rendering his PhD thesis worthless. The legal basis for this is a German law which allows universities to deny or withdraw academic degrees where the candidate has used his academic credentials or knowledge to commit a crime. Rudolf subsequently withdrew his application. Between 1991 and 1994, Herrmann and other lawyers used Rudolf's Auschwitz report to defend several Holocaust deniers, among them Otto Ernst Remer, a former Wehrmacht officer charged with Volksverhetzung (inciting hatred). Rudolf knew his work would be associated with Holocaust denial, but insisted that even Remer had a right to legal defense. Rudolf stated that his findings at Auschwitz and Birkenau \\"completely shattered his world view\\". Among other things, Rudolf's report claims that only insignificant traces of cyanide compounds can be found in the samples taken from Auschwitz. However, Richard Green and Jamie McCarthy from The Holocaust History Project have criticized the report, saying that like Fred Leuchter in his report, Rudolf did not discriminate against the formation of iron-based cyanide compounds, which are not a reliable indicator of the presence of cyanide, so that his experiment was seriously flawed. Criminal convictions In 1995, Rudolf was sentenced to 14 months in prison by the district court of Stuttgart for \\"inciting racial hatred\\" via the \\"Rudolf Report\\", as Holocaust denial is a criminal offence in Germany. Rudolf avoided prison by fleeing to Spain, England, and finally to the United States. His first marriage was to a German national with whom he had two children, and they settled at Hastings in England, until he and his wife divorced and she returned to Germany with their children. All the while, criminal investigations continued in Germany. In August 2004, the district court of Mannheim distrained a bank account in an attempt to confiscate 55% of Rudolf's business turnover from the years 2001-2004, some ‚Ç¨214,000, but at that time the account contained only some ‚Ç¨5,000. Rudolf and his associates had earned this money by selling Holocaust denial publications which are banned in Germany, but Rudolf's business was in the UK and the US. On 11 September 2004, Rudolf married a US citizen and settled in Chicago; the couple later had a child.David Cole, Republican Party Animal: The \\"Bad Boy of Holocaust History\\" Blows the Lid (2014), p. 120 He applied for political asylum, or at least for the right not to be expelled, but this was rejected in November 2004 on the basis that the application had no merits and was a case of frivolous litigation. Rudolf appealed against this ruling, and in early 2006 the US Federal Court in Atlanta found that his application was not \\"frivolous\\", but upheld the decision that it had no merit. The Immigration Services said that Rudolf did not have a right to file an application to remain with his family. On 14 November 2005, Rudolf was extradited to Germany where he was wanted for incitement of racial hatred (Volksverhetzung).\\"2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Germany,\\" US Department of State (6 March 2007) On arrival there, he was arrested by the police and transferred to a prison in Rottenburg, then to another in Stuttgart in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. On 15 March 2007, the Mannheim District Court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison for inciting hatred, disparaging the dead, and libel. Rudolf accepted the verdict, and copies of his \\"Lectures on the Holocaust\\" were confiscated and destroyed. The prosecution's initial request to confiscate ‚Ç¨214,000 was reduced to ‚Ç¨21,000, the total turnover from the sales of the book. He was released from prison on 5 July 2009 and now lives in the US with his wife and daughter. In July 2019, Rudolf was arrested near his home in Red Lion, Pennsylvania for \\"open lewdness\\" after being found exercising at 4:06 a.m. in a public park \\"naked from the waist down.\\" Publications After Rudolf was dismissed from the Max Planck Institute, he began to publish books promoting Holocaust denial. He founded Castle Hill Publishers in 1997 based in Hastings, England with Theses & Dissertations Press as its American outlet. In 2000, Rudolf initiated an English language Holocaust Handbooks Series, a series of Holocaust denial titles which, as of 2013, encompassed 25 titles. Furthermore, Rudolf is closely associated with the Belgian Holocaust denial organization Vrij Historisch Onderzoek (VHO). Until his arrest in late 2005, he published the now defunct \\"Vierteljahreshefte f√ºr freie Geschichtsforschung\\" (Quarterly journal for free historical research), described by the German Office for the Protection of the Constitution as \\"a right-wing extremist organ.\\"Annual Report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution 2002 , Right-Wing Extremist Activities, VII.

Biography A native of Oakland, California, he began his professional career as a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle and enjoyed a successful career as a mystery novelist (under the name Geoffrey Homes). He worked as a film publicist and eventually abandoned fiction for a successful career as a screenwriter. His first novel (and the only one he ever published under his own name), One Against the Earth, was a proletarian novel about a young man born on a California ranch who becomes a drifter and is eventually unjustly accused of attacking a child, was published in 1932. He made his real mark, however, with a string of hard-boiled mystery novels (mostly with small-town California settings), the first of which was The Man Who Murdered Himself (1936). His final published novel, Build My Gallows High (William Morrow & Co., 1946), is generally regarded as his best‚Äîand its adaptation (by \\"Homes\\" himself) into the film noir classic Out of the Past assured his place in film history. Mainwaring explained to interviewer Pat McGilligan that he regarded the novel as a departure from his earlier literary efforts: > With Build My Gallows High, I wanted to get away from straight mystery > novels. Those detective stories are a bore to write. You've got to figure > out \\"whodunit\\". I'd get to the end and have to say whodunit and be so mixed > up I couldn't decide myself. By the time Out of the Past appeared in 1947, Mainwaring had already begun to devote himself exclusively to screenwriting (first under the Homes pseudonym and later under his real name). Other notable credits during this period included The Big Steal (1949, directed by Don Siegel) and This Woman is Dangerous (1952, with Joan Crawford). His first important film work bearing his real name were the 1954 shot-on-location crime thriller The Phenix City Story (1954) and the original version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956).Daniel Mainwaring profile, imdb.com; accessed November 18, 2016. As director Joseph Losey, whose The Lawless was adapted by Mainwaring from the writer's own short story (publication undetermined), The Voice of Stephen Wilder, noted: > This is one of the things that makes me very close to Dan Mainwaring‚Äîhis > experience of Americana, the nostalgia of the good things about small towns. > I remember the smell of burning leaves at night in the autumn too. And I > remember the smell of Christmas, the sparkle in the air at football games, > and the sound of distant trains. And Dan remembers them all. He's a much > underrated writer and he's a really quite noble man. He damaged himself with > drink and he was very badly hurt by the blacklist.Michel Ciment: > Conversations with Losey, Methuen & Company, London, 1985. According to Frank Krutnik's book \\"Un-American‚Äú Hollywood,Frank Krutnik: \\"Un- American\\" Hollywood: Politics and Film in the Blacklist Era, Rutgers University Press, 2007. Loseys memory seems to serve him wrong here. Mainwaring's widow claims her husband actually acted as a front for blacklisted author Paul Jarrico. Also, his name appears on several movie credits in the 1950s which would have been impossible for a blacklisted author. The first film to break the blacklisting rule by naming a \\"banned\\" screenwriter (Dalton Trumbo) in the credits was Otto Preminger's 1960 film, Exodus. Mainwaring's work on Ida Lupino's film noir The Hitch-Hiker was not credited. In 1960, Mainwaring was hired by fantasy-film producer-director George Pal to write the screenplay for the MGM Studios film Atlantis, the Lost Continent, released in 1961. He based his script on a play written by Gerald Hargreaves in 1945. Toward the end of his career, in the 1960s, he wrote for TV shows like The Wild Wild West and Mannix. He did not live long enough to see Out of the Past remade as Against All Odds (1984).

He played in 20 Tests and 88 ODIs from 1994 to 2001 and was an important part of the all-conquering Australian teams under Steve Waugh and Mark Taylor. In recent years Fleming has spent time refining his theory of Bowlology, a set of scientific coaching principles to help developing bowlers. Injury problems shortened his career, with the side-on bowling action that generated his swing, also putting more strain on his body. International career Fleming's 20 Tests between 1994‚Äì95 and 2000-01 returned 75 wickets at an average of 25.89 with best figures of 5/30. He is one of only three men (along with Maurice Allom and Peter Petherick) to have taken a hat-trick on Test debut. Fleming's hat-trick was taken against Pakistan at Rawalpindi where he claimed Australia's nemesis Salim Malik in the second innings as his third wicket.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/153252.html His Test match record is impressive, with the 1999-2000 season Fleming's finest hour: he claimed 31 wickets in six Tests against Pakistan and India. His career best figures of 5/31 came against India at Adelaide in December 1999, where if not for Shane Warne spilling up a simple slips catch, Fleming would have claimed a second hat-trick.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/153773.html, Fleming's ODI record is equally impressive, representing his country 88 times including two World Cup finals and taking 134 wickets at an average of 25.38. He was seen by many to be a one-day specialist, especially in the latter overs when his fine economy rate kept runs down. Fleming was the last-over specialist in both the 1996 and 1999 World Cup Semi-Finals. In 1996 at Mohali with the West Indies needing six runs to win off five balls, Fleming bowled Courtney Walsh for victory.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/151233.html In 1999 at Edgbaston, with South Africa requiring one run with four balls remaining, it took an Allan Donald brain-fade to send Australia into the final.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/151525.html Domestic career He played 78 First Class Matches for Victoria taking 258 wickets. He took 6/37 on First Class debut vs Western Australia in 1989/90. Fleming was named in the South Melbourne Cricket Club‚Äôs team of the 20th century, alongside such greats as Bill Woodfull, Keith Miller and Clarrie Grimmett. Post-retirement Following his retirement from all cricket in 2003 he was appointed head coach at the Australian Cricket Academy. It was around this time that the beginnings of Bowlology theory began to take shape. Like many of his counterparts, Fleming became a cricket commentator for both internationals and domestic Sheffield Shield matches. He has been heard on Melbourne's Triple M and SEN 1116 radio, and is a specialist cricket commentator for ABC Radio Grandstand, Channel Ten and Fox Sports. Fleming, a keen Hawthorn fan, appeared on Before the Bounce in 2009 with Jason Dunstall and Danny Frawley, a weekly Australian football program broadcast on Foxtel, before becoming a regular on the show's successor After the Bounce. Recognising his capacity for unique sporting insights (developed through deep contemplation of Bowlology theory) the show's producers gave Fleming a role akin to 'editor at large' in his segment Turn It Up. In this segment, Fleming cast a critical eye over the AFL and society in general, raising the taboo and confronting issues that others often feared to raise. He also ran a part of the show featuring a broken chocolate wheel. Although now semi-retired from his role on After The Bounce, his Turn It Up segment has become a mainstay of the show's format, having been bequeathed to Andrew 'Gazey' Gaze upon Fleming's departure.

Identity While it was traditionally assumed that Pimay succeeded his father, newer archaeological evidence uncovered by Aidan Dodson in 1993 established that a new Tanite dynasty 22 king named Shoshenq IV actually succeeded Shoshenq III. Pimay was a different man from king Pami of the 22nd Dynasty because the orthography and translation of their respective names are different. While the name Pami reads as \\"The Cat\\" in Egyptian, the name Pimay translates as \\"The Lion\\". King Pami's name was mistakenly transcribed into Pimay by past historians based on the common (and now erroneous) view that he was Shoshenq III's son and successor. Moreover, if Pimay did indeed outlive his father, he should have succeeded his father as king rather than the obscure Shoshenq IV who is not attested as a son of Shoshenq III in contemporary historical sources. Consequently, it seems certain that Shoshenq III outlived all of his sons through his nearly 4 decade long reign. Pimay, hence, likely predeceased his father. It is possible that Pimay also was a governor at Sais in the Western Nile Delta, as suggested by a statue group dedicated by him which was rediscovered in that city. If so, he was an indirect predecessor of the Great Chief of the Ma Osorkon C, who in turn will be succeeded by the future pharaoh of the 24th Dynasty, Tefnakht., ¬ß 113 References Category:People of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt Category:Ancient Egyptian princes Category:8th- century BC rulers Category:Chiefs of the Ma ","title":"Pimay"},{"id":"2533793","text":"South.Point Tuggeranong Tuggeranong Town Centre services the southernmost Canberra district of Tuggeranong.

Morris is known for the 1983 ballad \\"The Wind Beneath My Wings\\", although his credits include more than twenty-five other chart singles on the Billboard country charts, including five No. 1 hits. He has also released nine studio albums, mostly in the country pop vein, with his 1983 album Why Lady Why having earned a gold certification from the RIAA. Early life Morris has two siblings, a twin sister (Carey) and younger brother, Mark. Even though Morris was best known for pop-oriented hits in the 1980s, he was descended from a long line of traditional country singers, who sang hard-twang country and also gospel. Gary's family moved from Fort Worth, Texas to North Richland Hills, Texas in the late 1950s.*North Richland Hills, Tex. : CitiCable, [1986]NRH profiles [DVD], Arlita W. Hallam interview. While in the third grade, Morris and his sister won a talent show after singing their rendition of the pop hit \\"This Old House,\\" originally popularized by Rosemary Clooney. Morris, a good athlete, played four sports at Richland High School, which led to a scholarship with Cisco Junior College in Texas. It was during college that singing became Morris's chosen vocation, and he decided to move to Colorado. He and his two friends formed a trio, and asked a Colorado Springs bartender if they could get up on the bandstand and perform a few songs, and the audience's response (and tips) convinced Morris to put his college plans on hold and to pursue a performing career.[ Gary Morris Biography at All Music] In the early 1970s, Morris made a living by singing in nightclubs in Denver, Colorado. He also wrote a few commercial jingles for Frontier Airlines. In 1976, Morris signed on with Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and sang at fundraisers during Carter's campaign. This job led to Morris' performing at the White House following Carter's election. In the audience was Nashville country music producer Norro Wilson, to whom Morris later gave a demo tape. Wilson liked what he heard, and soon signed Morris to his label Warner Bros. Records. Recording career Morris signed his recording contract with Warner Bros. in 1980. After a pair of minor hits landed just inside the top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, he scored his breakthrough hit with \\"Headed for a Heartache\\"; that song reached No. 8 on the country chart in late 1981. Two follow-up singles also reached the top 15. Morris' 1983 album, Why Lady Why focused more on ballads. One of the album's four singles was \\"Wind Beneath My Wings,\\" which showcased Morris' soaring tenor. Written by Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar, the song about heroes ‚Äî which Morris recorded as a ballad ‚Äî became one of the earliest hit versions of the song; a better-known version by Bette Midler would top the Billboard Hot 100 in 1989. The Why Lady Why album also featured the ballad \\"The Love She Found in Me,\\" the mid-tempoed \\"Velvet Chains\\" and the up-tempoed title track as singles; all of them peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Also during this time, Morris recorded a duet with Lynn Anderson called \\"You're Welcome to Tonight,\\" which became a top 10 hit. After two more top 10 hits in 1984 ‚Äî \\"Between Two Fires\\" and \\"Second Hand Heart\\" ‚Äî Morris scored his first No. 1 country hit in March 1985 with \\"Baby Bye Bye.\\" During what was his most prolific hitmaking part of his career, Morris had three more solo No. 1 hits during the next two years: \\"I'll Never Stop Loving You,\\" \\"100% Chance of Rain\\" and \\"Leave Me Lonely.\\" He also recorded a chart-topping duet with Crystal Gayle, \\"Makin' Up For Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers Song).\\" Although he rarely saw any success outside country music, many of Morris' hit songs were in the pop-country vein during the height of his career. Morris had two more hits in 1987: the solo \\"Plain Brown Wrapper\\" and another duet with Gayle called \\"Another World.\\" The latter song was used for many years as the theme for the NBC soap opera. After that, Morris' success on the country charts began to fade, as tastes switched once again to neo-traditional country music. Morris later opened a music publishing office in Nashville, with one of his employees being future star Faith Hill.Williams, Janet E. (1998). \\"Faith Hill\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 240. In early 2008, Morris released two Gospel CDs. His most recent CD is called, \\"Faith and Freedom,\\" dedicated to the military troops. Gary Morris performed two songs featured on Juice Newton's album Duets: Friends & Memories, which was released in October 2010. Acting career Morris took a break from touring to pursue a serious acting career. One of his first big roles was in the Broadway production of Les Mis√©rables, as Jean Valjean. The full symphonic recording of Les Mis√©rables is a platinum- selling, Grammy Award-winning album and features Morris' vocals throughout in the role of Valjean, including his version of the song \\"Bring Him Home.\\"Gary Morris biography at his official website Morris has also appeared in a production of Puccini's opera La Boheme with fellow country/pop singer Linda Ronstadt. In the 1980s, he did a stint on The Colbys as blind country music singer Wayne Masterson, signed to Dominique Deveraux's label. On the show, he sang \\"Try Gettin' Over You\\" from his Anything Goes release. In the 1990s, he spent a great deal of time working on music projects, such as the PBS special concert production, in Moscow, Russia, in the famous Tretyakov Gallery. He returned to country music in the 1990s, performing in concerts and as a record producer. Morris hosted and also produced the Nashville network's The North American Sportsman. In 1992, he appeared in an episode of Designing Women as Julia's surgeon. Discography References External links *CMT.com profile *Millard, Bob (1998). \\"Gary Morris\\".

The genus is native to Europe, Asia and North America, but the European searocket has been introduced into North America and has spread widely on both east and west coasts; in many places it is replacing the native C. edentula, and is regarded as an undesirable invasive species.

Cricket career The son of Bob Blewett who represented South Australia in the 1970s, Blewett was born in Adelaide. Blewett was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1990. He began his domestic career in 1991‚Äì92 playing for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield and One Day domestic tournament competition in Australia. He made his international debut for the Australian team playing for Australia A during a World Series Cup tournament against Australia in 1994‚Äì95. During this tournament he displayed his batting performances against former Australian fast bowler, Craig McDermott. In January 1995, he made his Test debut for Australia against England in the Adelaide Oval in South Australia; scoring a century on his debut match. He followed that with a century in the WACA Ground in Perth during his second match and scored a century at Edgbaston in England in 1997 and scoring three centuries in his first three Ashes Test series. He also represented the national team in One Day International matches. During his peak, he batted with aggression and he was effective against both fast bowlers and spinners. He was particularly strong square of the wicket, which was rewarded on his home ground, the Adelaide Oval, where the square boundaries are shorter. He was also an effective medium pacebowler (average bowling speed 125 km/h). His highest Test match score was 214 runs, against South Africa in Johannesburg in South Africa. Most of those runs were achieved with his former teammate and captain, Steve Waugh, with whom he was involved in one of the highest batting partnerships in cricket when the pair scored 385 runs together, batting for an entire day's play without losing a wicket. Despite his qualities as a batsman, he was known to struggle against spin bowling. He has been dismissed (out) in the past by several spin bowlers, including the former Pakistan and Indian spinners, Mushtaq Ahmed and Anil Kumble. After achieving a successful first year in the international cricket, he encountered Mushtaq Ahmed when Pakistan visited Australia in the 1995‚Äì96 season. He was unable to pick which way Mushtaq's deliveries were turning and was continuously dismissed in the tournament by being declared Leg before wicket or being bowled, either playing down the wrong line or not offering shot to a googly that turned into his stumps. He was subsequently replaced by Ricky Ponting, but in 1996 he regained his batting position after Ponting himself had fallen upon hard times. Blewett then performed well with the bat, until the 1998 tour to India, where he struggled against Kumble and he was dropped in favour of Justin Langer. However, upon the retirement of captain Mark Taylor in 1999, Blewett was selected to become an opening batsman, until he was dropped from the Australian team in favour of Matthew Hayden in early 2000 after a period of poor performances, which ended his international career. He retired from professional cricket in 2006 when he played his last match in First-class cricket and One Day Domestic matches against Queensland and Tasmania. Waugh, who captained Australia from 1999‚Äì2004, said that Blewett had \\"a technical batting problem in his defence, when facing deliveries and he often left a gap between bat and pad.\\" Test and One Day International averages of 34 and 20 respectively also reflect his inability to, according to Waugh, \\"align...talent with results\\". Waugh attributed this to a \\"lack of discipline and...self-belief.\\" Media career Since retiring from professional cricket, Blewett has pursued a commentating career. In December 2013, Blewett became a member of the Fairfax Radio Network (FRN) commentary team that broadcast selected Test matches, One Day Internationals, the Big Bash League (BBL) and T20 International matches on network stations including 3AW Melbourne, 2UE Sydney, 4BC Brisbane, 6PR Perth and on digital radio.\\"Fairfax Radio Network secures cricket broadcast rights deal\\" by 3AW Radio, The Age, 1 November 2013. Retrieved 28 December 2013. In 2018 he joined the Seven Network as a commentator for Test Cricket and Big Bash League and Triple M Adelaide as a co-host of the Dead Set Legends show.  Coaching career  Blewett was named fielding consultant of Australia for the one-day tri-series in Zimbabwe and for their matches against Pakistan in the UAE in 2014. He completed a level three coaching accreditation in 2014 and worked with Australia A and the National Performance Squad at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Brisbane.Blewett joins Australia as fielding consultant Personal life Blewett's first marriage was to Adelaide radio personality , Jodie Blewett, and they had a daughter.

It is more commonly referred to as St Pat's, SPS or St Patrick's. Students and old boys call themselves Patricians or Sons of St. Patrick's. History The school was founded in 1933 as a temporary branch school of Saint Joseph's Institution, another Catholic boys' school in Singapore. It was built on land acquired by the La Salle Brothers in 1898 which was originally intended for building a resort bungalow. Brother Stephen Buckley saw the population growth in eastern Singapore and petitioned the La Salle Brothers to build a school on that piece of land. The main school building was completed in 1932 and Saint Patrick's became a school in its own right in 1933. During World War II, the school was used by the British as a hospital and later by the Japanese as an administrative building. It was returned to the La Salle Brothers in 1946. In 1957, the primary section of the school was separated and became Saint Stephen's School, a primary school for boys. In 1969, Saint Patrick's became a co-educational school with the introduction of pre-university classes. However, with the phasing out of such classes in 1978, the school returned to being an all-boys school. In 2002, Lucas Lak Pati Singh, a former vice principal of Changkat Changi Secondary School and an educator of 38 years, was posted into Saint Patrick's as the school's new principal. During his tenure of office, Lak brought in several measures to raise academic standards and improve students' conduct. The full history of Saint Patrick's and its alumni can be viewed either on the school website, the old boys' (The Patrician Society) website or at the School's Heritage Room (previously the old school library). Lucas Lak Pati Singh, the school's longest-serving principal, was succeeded in 2012 by Adolphus Tan, a former principal of Shuqun Secondary School. Joseph Peterson, a senior physics teacher, was promoted to vice-principal, joining Aloysius Yong, an alumnus who has served in various other capacities in the school and had been the sole vice-principal until then. By 2019, Aloysius Yong had retired while Adolphus Tan and Joseph Peterson had been posted to other schools. The current school leadership consists of Mark Minjoot, the principal, and Paul Leong, the sole vice-principal.  Identity and culture  In keeping with the school's Catholic traditions, students recite the Apostles' Creed in the morning, and the Angelus or the Regina Coeli during Easter at noon. = School symbols = St Patrick's School annual Sports Day at Bedok Stadium. Photo taken on 22 May 2014 The shamrock is found on the student's belt, socks and neck-tie, on the running vests and on the T-shirts, and the school flag is a shamrock on a blue background. It is made up of three green hearts touching at the centre at an equal spacing from each other. Two of the hearts are at the lower half with one at the upper half. The shamrock represents the school's virtues of \\"Humanity, Humility & Honesty\\". The school's patron saint, Saint Patrick, used the shamrock to represent the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Another icon of the school is the \\"I Love St Pat's\\" logo. It is printed on mugs, T-shirts, vests, decals, wristbands and umbrellas sold by the school. =Uniform and discipline= The all-white school uniform is compulsory. The full uniform is a white short-sleeved shirt with the school badge pinned on the top left hand corner above the shirt pocket, white short trousers (for lower secondary students) or white long trousers (for upper secondary), white school socks with the shamrock logo, white canvas shoes or sports shoes (sports shoes do not have to be white), and a tie. Students wear the school tie every morning for assembly unless they have PE lessons on that day. The shirt must be tucked into the pants. Details of the uniform are set out in the school's Rules and Regulations. =Houses and sports events= The school has six houses named after former brother principals of the school. * Brother Joseph McNally (McNally House) ‚Äì Green * Brother Joseph Kiely (Kiely House) ‚Äì Blue * Brother Stephen Buckley (Buckley House) ‚Äì Orange * Brother Cannice Brennan (Brennan House) ‚Äì Yellow * Brother Alban Rozario (Alban House) ‚Äì Red * Brother Justinian De Souza (Justinian House) ‚Äì Purple Houses compete in activities during Sports Day, Interhouse Games, Cross Country and other activities. Students buy House T-shirts of their respective houses, which carry the slogan 'I Love St. Pat's' and the school badge with the name and colour of their house on their shirts. Other than inter-house games, other sports events are also organised. Every year, selected students participate in the inter-class football league. Affiliations Saint Patrick's School is affiliated with all four of the Lasallian primary schools in Singapore, St. Joseph's Institution as well as Catholic Junior College. It maintains relationships with other Roman Catholic schools in Singapore as well. * St. Joseph's Institution Junior (formerly St. Michael's School) * St. Stephen's School * De La Salle School * St. Anthony's Primary School Co-curricular activities A notable co-curricular activity at Saint Patrick's is its military band, which has won gold medals in competitions locally and abroad, under the baton of their resident conductor, David Glosz, from 1984 to 2016. In the 2005 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), the band won Gold with Honours. This was the first year such an award was introduced into the SYF grading scheme. In the 2007 SYF, the SPSMB achieved a Gold with Honours, which was the 2nd consecutive Gold With Honour award. In the 2009 SYF, the Band again won Gold with Honours, its tenth consecutive Gold award in the SYF and its third consecutive Gold with Honours. And in 2011 SYF, the Band achieved Gold with Honours, its 11th consecutive Gold award and fourth consecutive Gold with Honours. On special occasions, the school's Military Band plays a live version of the School Rally as opposed to the audio recording which is usually played every morning. The tradition took place particularly at the annual opening ceremony of the Patrician Annual Enrichment Festival (PAEF), but as of 2012, it has been gradually rescinded to a once-a-year affair. In addition, the Saint Patrick's School Military Band also held a commemorative concert at the Esplanade Concert Hall to celebrate its 60th Anniversary. The school has four uniformed groups, all of which have their own outstanding achievements. They are the Scouts, National Cadet Corps (Land), National Cadet Corps (Air) and National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). The Saint Patrick's Pajigwad Scout Troop is the oldest scout troop in the Katong district. They have achieved the Frank Cooper Sands Gold award for several years running thanks to the high standard of training planned by the teachers and the Patrol Leaders Council. A notable alumni of the troop is Tony Tan, the seventh President of Singapore. He returned to the school during the Adiji Scout Ceremony in 2012 to accept his role as Chief Scout of the Singapore Scout Association. More than 6000 scouts attended the event. The school also encourages students to take up leadership roles, hence the establishment of the Peer Leader's Council, the Prefectorial Board and the Board of Patrician Ambassadors. These Patrician student leaders facilitate camps such as the Patricians' Leadership Training Camp (PLTC) which is held overseas in countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, as well as local camps such as the secondary one orientation camp for new students every year. Selected students also represent their school and participate in the Lasallian Leaders Servant Leadership Camp (LLSLC), where they and students from Lasallian schools in the Philippines interact with each other to learn servant leadership by helping less fortunate communities in the Philippines.

It also includes a 20-screen Century movie theater. Location The mall has a Happy Valley, Oregon, mailing address, but is actually located in an unincorporated area. However, the city of Happy Valley was interested in annexing the area that includes the mall. The nearby city of Milwaukie was also interested in annexing the area. In December 2012, mediation between officials of the two cities resulted in a draft agreement under which the mall and other land west of Interstate 205 would eventually be annexed by Milwaukie. History =Construction and early years= Tonya Harding skating in the mall Ice Chalet, 1994; the ice rink was removed in late 2007 during renovations The two-level enclosed mall, with of retail space officially opened on March 6, 1981, built by Ernest W. Hahn, Inc. and designed by Seattle architects John Graham & Company. Prior to the mall's opening, the attached the Meier & Frank store opened in October 1980. Original anchors included JCPenney, Meier & Frank, Nordstrom, Sears and Montgomery Ward. There was also an ice rink; a five-screen movie theater; and a branch of the Clackamas County Library. Also featured were three large cedar sculptures carved by artist and woodsman, Dudley C. Carter, which were commissioned by the center in 1979, when Carter was eighty-eight. South entrance in 2011 TriMet diverted or extended its bus service into the new mall, constructing a new transit center in the parking area on the mall's north side,Kohler, Vince (June 30, 1981). \\"Clackamas center builds bus facility\\".

The Oregonian (MetroSouth edition), p. MS4. and by 1985 was being used by six bus routes. In the 1990s, Olympic skater Tonya Harding frequently practiced on the ice rink. The mall remained largely unchanged until Montgomery Ward went bankrupt and closed its store in 2001. Meier & Frank acquired the former Ward building and opened a home store in 2002 in the upper level, while leasing out the lower level to Copeland Sports. The ice rink closed in 2003, the original movie theater closed in 2005, and Copeland in turn closed in 2006. Macy's reclaimed the former Copeland's space and expanded the home store into that space. =2007 renovations and expansion= Interior view in 2011 General Growth Properties acquired a 50% interest in the property in 2002 and assumed management. A major redevelopment began in 2005 to add to the center. As part of the construction the area formerly occupied by the ice rink was gutted, and the Carter sculptures were removed. Designed by architectural firm DLR Group, the renovation and expansion added approximately 40 new stores and restaurants, many in a new lifestyle center on the south side, and a new , 20-screen Century multiplex theater. The renovation also put in tranquility ponds, new flooring, lighting, furniture, escalators, elevators, handrails, and exterior upgrades. It was completed in late 2007. The new, larger movie theater opened in December 2007. In September 2009, a new MAX Light Rail station opened at the mall, with the opening of the Green Line. The Clackamas Town Center Transit Center station is the southern terminus of the Green Line and is located on the east side of the mall's parking area. It is also served by several bus lines and it replaced the original transit center, which had closed in 2006 and temporarily been replaced by simple bus stops pending construction of the new facility. =2012 shooting= A shooting occurred on December 11, 2012, which left three people, including the gunman, dead, and one person seriously wounded. At approximately 3:20 p.m. PST., 22-year-old Jacob Tyler Roberts opened fire near Macy's at the upper level of the mall with an AR-15 rifle. Roberts was wearing a hockey mask and was heard by witnesses shouting out \\"I am the shooter!\\" while he fired shots. A 45-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were killed, and Roberts died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. A fifteen-year-old girl suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and was hospitalized at Oregon Health & Science University Hospital in serious, stable condition. An estimated 60 rounds were fired from Roberts' rifle, and there were about 10,000 shoppers present at the mall at the time of the attack. =2018 Sears closure and 2020 opening of Dick's Sporting Goods= In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Clackamas Town Center, into Seritage Growth Properties. On August 22, 2018, Sears announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 46 stores nationwide. The store closed in November 2018.

From the time of its foundation in 1924 until 1985, Amani High School was recognized as one of the elite schools in Kabul and received direct support from Germany, which helped to provide qualified staff. German was not only taught as a foreign language, but also was the teaching language in the higher classes in most subjects, being taught by qualified German teachers. The school is under the control of the Afghan Ministry of Education. After the US invasion in late 2001, the buildings had been looted and partially destroyed. Reconstruction began with German help in spring 2002. The German support has resumed, which was suspended during the reign of the Taliban from 1996 to 2001. German teachers once again came to Afghanistan to teach. However, German is now only taught as a foreign language. Classes in all other subjects are held in Dari. The school teaches children from class 1 to 12. Up to 4th grade the classes are coeducational. From 5th to 12th only boys are allowed. Amani High School has two big courtyards, a mosque, a sports field with a football court, two basketball courts and stands. There are modern laboratories for the science departments: Biology, Chemistry and Physics. The classrooms are furnished with tables and chairs, which is not taken for granted in Afghan schools, even in the capital Kabul.

The band's continual members were lead vocalist Martin Tamburovich, guitarist D. Boon, bassist Mike Watt, and drummer George Hurley. The Reactionaries existed for most of 1978 and 1979, practicing regularly but rarely if ever performing live. After their breakup in late 1979, Watt and Boon formed Minutemen with drummer Frank Tonche and Hurley joined Hey Taxi!; Hurley joined Minutemen soon afterwards, replacing original Minutemen drummer Tonche. History At the time, San Pedro was more receptive to classic rock cover bands than to original acts, and the nearby Los Angeles' punk scene was not yet prepared to take a band from San Pedro seriously. One band that did take the group seriously was another struggling L.A. punk band, Black Flag. Tamburovich's influence and input remained with his friends and former bandmates for the whole of Minutemen's existence; Watt, Boon, and Tamburovich co-founded New Alliance Records in 1980; Tamburovich would contribute lyrics to several Minutemen songs and sometimes travel with the band as a roadie. No formal studio recordings of The Reactionaries exist, but a demo recording (possibly from a rehearsal tape) made in January 1979 of the song \\"Tony Gets Wasted In Pedro\\" appears on Minutemen's odds-and-sods compilation album The Politics of Time, first released in 1984 on New Alliance. When Tamburovich died of a bacterial infection in 2003, Watt played \\"Tony Gets Wasted In Pedro\\" in tribute to his friend on his internet radio show The Watt from Pedro Show. In 2009, a San Pedro-based independent label, Water Under The Bridge Records, released The Reactionaries' first record. The first side of the LP contains ten songs that The Reactionaries recorded in George Hurley's Shed in 1979, fully re-mastered from the original tape. The second side contains the same ten songs re-recorded by four decades of different San Pedro musicians (including George Hurley and Mike Watt). The record, titled 1979, was released on February 20, 2010.

In Italian an epifania (plural: epifanie, with both forms accented on the second \\"i\\") indicates a sudden spiritual manifestation (See: Epiphany). Berio composed his Epifanie between 1960 and 1963, and published a revised version in 1965. It consists of seven short orchestral pieces, and five vocal pieces. Berio stipulates the possibility of performing these in ten different sequences. When the American premiere of Epifanie took place in Chicago on July 23, 1967, he said: :Epifanie is, in essence, a cycle of orchestral pieces into which a cycle of vocals pieces has been interpolated. The two 'cycles' can be combined together in various ways; they can also be performed separately. The texts of the vocal pieces have been taken from Proust (√Ä l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs), Antonio Machado (Nuevas Canciones), Joyce (A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses), Edoardo Sanguineti (Triperuno), Claude Simon (La route des Flandres), and Brecht (An die Nachgeborenen). :The significant connection between the vocals pieces can thus appear in different lights according to their position in the instrumental development. The chosen order will emphasize the apparent heterogeneity of the texts or their dialectic unity. The texts are arranged in such a way as to suggest a gradual passage from a lyric transfiguration of reality (Proust, Machado, Joyce) to a disenchanted acknowledgment of things (Simon; for this text the voice speaks and becomes gradually nullified by the orchestra). Lastly, the words of Bertolt Brecht, which have nothing to do with the epiphany of words and visions. They are the cry of regret and anguish with which Brecht warns us that often it is necessary to renounce the seduction of words when they sound like an invitation to forget our links to a world constructed by our own acts. The score calls for an unusually large orchestra: 16 woodwinds; 6 horns, 4 trumpets and 4 trombones plus tuba, full strings, including three violin sections, and a percussion section calling for a number of performers who address themselves not only to glockenspiel, celesta, vibraphone and marimba but also to spring coils, tamtam, tom-tom, temple blocks, wood blocks, bongos, timpani, cowbells, tubular bells, claves, guiro, censerros, cymbals, snare drum, tambourine, etc. The BBC Proms premiere was given in the Royal Albert Hall, London on 8 August 1986, by Elizabeth Laurence and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Edward Downes.

Gosdin then formed The Gosdin Brothers with brother Rex. The duo appeared on the charts in the late 1960s with a song titled \\"Hangin' On\\" on the Bakersfield International label, then with \\"Till The End\\" on Capitol Records. During the same time period, the Gosdin Brothers were featured on Hillman's former Byrds mate Gene Clark's first solo album, the 1967 well-regarded Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers, singing backing vocals on all of the tracks behind the lead vocals of Clark and lead guitars of Clarence White, Glen Campbell, and Bill Rinehart (later of the Merry-Go-Round). =1970s - Retirement and comeback= Gosdin retired from performing during the 1970s and moved to Cartersville, Georgia, where he operated a glass company.

After Ovation Records closed their doors later in 1981, Gosdin signed with A.M.I. Records where he scored a Top 10 hit in 1982 with \\"Today My World Slipped Away\\". (This song later became a number- three hit for George Strait). 'Tennessee Courage': First released by Gosdin in 1983, Tennessee Courage was written by Louis Brown, Gosdin and Max D. Barnes. The song would also be recorded by Keith Whitley and many others over the years and is considered a favorite among fans of traditional country music. Barnes and Brown were both notable Nashville songwriters each with hundreds of songwriting credit Barnes would eventually win over 42 songwriting awards in his career.

Gosdin, meanwhile, signed with Complete Records in the early 1980s, and, in 1984, released \\"There Is A Season,\\" picked by the Los Angeles Times as best country album of the year. The early 1980s also found a great combination of talent as Gosdin traveled from coast to coast opening shows for George Jones. =1983-1985: If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right) and There Is a Season= Gosdin made the top 10 consistently in the early '80s, really hitting his stride when he teamed with Barnes as a songwriting collaborator.

Purfling is a narrow decorative edge inlaid into the top plate and often the back plate of a stringed instrument. Inexpensive instruments may have no purfling and instead simulate the appearance with paint. Purfling was originally made of laminated strips of wood, often contrasting in color as a visual accent. The earliest known example of purfling is on a violin made by Andrea Amati in 1564, now on display in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. It consists of two outer strips of pearwood stained black and an inner strip of poplar.Faber, Toby, Stradivari's Genius, Random House, 2004; Eventually, nacre from shell, usually mother of pearl or abalone, and other hard inlay materials were incorporated to provide highly decorative effects. Elaborate inlay is found most often on fretted instruments. Laminates and composites made from nacreous shell and synthetic materials, described as \\"fake\\", \\"faux\\", or \\"shin paua\\", are sometimes used by luthiers. The channel cut for the inlay of purfling may increase the flexibility of the plates where they join the sides, affecting an instrument's pitch and sustain. In cases of heavy decorative inlay, the effective vibrational area of the sound board may be reduced. Today plastic purfling is commonplace in mass-produced instruments. One common example of plastic purfling is a sandwich of three alternating strips in black and white, measuring about . However, many distinctive variations are used. Binding is a narrow outer strip of material on the edges of the body of stringed instruments such as lutes, mandolins, guitars and ukuleles. Binding may be made of thin wood strips. It is applied along the entire edge of top and back plates. While it can provide a decorative function, the primary purpose of binding is to block the transfer of moisture by the hygroscopic end grain of the plates of the instrument. This prevents cracks in a way that purfling cannot. It also reduces wear to instrument body edges. Hardwood, fruitwood, plastics and other synthetic materials are commonly used to make bindings. Binding may be used along the sides of fingerboards of fretted instruments. It softens the feel of the neck as one's fretting hand slides past the thin metal ends of fret wire, and it provides decorative appeal.

The suburb is located on the Al Khan Bay, which serves as a boundary between Sharjah and Dubai. Until recently, the area was deserted and home to a collection of crumbling traditional coral and adobe houses, but it now houses the Sharjah Aquarium. A number of the older buildings are being restored to create a heritage area. History Around the start of the 20th century, Al Khan was administered by a tribal ruler and consisted of some 75 pearling boats and a settlement containing families of the Al Bu Mahair, Mazari and Manasir tribes. A British man-of-war was called to the area in 1917 following an argument between the ruler of Sharjah and the headman of Al Khan, Muhammad bin Ubaid bin Jarash, over absconding debtors from other pearling communities taking refuge in the township. The uneasy relations between Al Khan and Sharjah continued until after 1934, when the Ruler of Sharjah appointed his brother, Mohammad, as Wali over the township. Al Khan was the scene of a firefight between the leaders of the rebellious Majlis movement and forces loyal to the Ruler of Dubai in February 1940. After several days of fighting, a truce was effected by the mediation of the Rulers of Umm Al Quwain, Ajman and Ras Al Khaimah on 29 March. In 2011, archaeological finds of neolithic and medieval times were made at Al Khan. Curiously, it seemed that the tradition of using the shoreline of Al Khan for mooring fishing boats and enjoying a cookout, had been kept up for thousands of years from the neolithic age to the present day. The survey being carried out by the Maritime Archaeology Stewardship Trust, has recovered the remains of houses, courtyards, and remnants.

In 2007, Lucassen left the band to continue on his own as he had originally planned, together with his girlfriend guitarist Lori Linstruth, and keyboardist Alejandro Mill√°n; Bovio, her boyfriend (later husband) and bassist Johan van Stratum and producer Joost van den Broek handling the composition duties afterwards. After keeping a steady line-up since 2009, the band announced in April 2016 that they would disband, wanting to end on a high note rather than letting the interest and inspiration fade away, after a live album entitled Memento and a final show on 28 December 2016. History Lucassen and Bovio had previously collaborated in Ayreon's album The Human Equation, for which Bovio (then in band Elfon√≠a) was selected by Lucassen via an internet female singing contest. Lucassen then decided to create a new band with her as lead vocalist, and selected other little-known musicians to form the rest of the band: van Stratum, keyboardist Alejandro Mill√°n (from Elfon√≠a as well), guitarist Lori Linstruth, and drummer Davy Mickers. Because the musicians in the band lived thousands of miles apart, Lucassen composed the group's 2005 debut album, Embrace the Storm, over the Internet, with Bovio writing all the lyrics. A live album, Live in the Real World, featuring songs from Lucassen's other projects Ayreon and Star One, was released the following year. In 2007, half of the Stream of Passion's line-up decided to leave: Lucassen left to make them continue their own career as he had planned since the creation, while Linstruth and Mill√°n also decided to quit. The three were respectively replaced by Hazebroek, Schultz, and Revet. After the release in 2009 of the band's first album without Lucassen on composition, The Flame Within, Mickers decided to leave the band, with Bovio and van Stratum being the only original members left. He was replaced by Peters who featured on the band's third album in 2011, Darker Days. In 2012 Stream of Passion left Napalm Records and decided to become an independent band, launching an Indiegogo campaign to finance their fourth full studio album. The new album, A War of Our Own, was released on 18 April 2014. In April of 2016 the band announced via Facebook that they would be separating at the end of the year, saying \\"Over the past eleven years we've had the time of our lives playing in stages all over the world and sharing moments of joy on stage. But all good things come to an end, and we feel it's time to move on and search for new musical challenges. We're proud of everything we've achieved, with your help, and we want to end the band history on a high note instead of losing focus, interest and drive. Before parting ways as a band we will perform a few goodbye shows; we also want to record a DVD to serve as a memento of the good times we've had. [...] Once again, we'd like to express our eternal gratitude for the support you've given us all these years. All of us will continue to make music, one way or the other; so we still hope to see you soon on a stage near you. Thank you for being part of the wonderful adventure that has been Stream of Passion!\\" The band released a live album entitled Memento and performed a final show on 28 December 2016. After the split-up, bassist Johan van Stratum and singer Marcela Bovio became part of the line-up for progressive metal band VUUR, but Bovio left the band before its debut release after she and fellow VUUR singer Anneke van Giersbergen realized they wanted to approach the vocals in different ways.

The committal procedure, sometimes known as a preliminary hearing, replaces the earlier grand jury process. In most jurisdictions criminal offences fall into one of three groups: There are less serious (summary) offences which are usually heard without a jury by a magistrate. These are roughly equivalent to the older category of misdemeanors (terminology that is now obsolete in most non-U.S. jurisdictions). There are intermediate offences which are indictable (equivalent to an old-style felony), but which can be heard summarily. For instance, theft is usually a serious offence. If however the charge is that the defendant stole a packet of biscuits worth only a very small amount, it would probably be heard by a magistrate. In Canada, these are known as hybrid offences, whereas in England and Wales, these are known as either way offences, and can only be heard summarily with the defendant's consent and if the Magistrates' Court finds that matter is suitable for summary trial. In Victoria, Australia, they are called indictable offences triable summarily. As well as the defendant's consent the Magistrate must regard the offence as appropriate to be heard in the lower court.For example, Magistrates Court Act, 1989 (Victoria) Finally, there are serious matters which must be dealt with in the higher courts, usually before a jury. When one is charged with an offence of the third type, a preliminary hearing is first held by a magistrate to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant committing the defendant for trial. That is, whether there is sufficient evidence such that a properly instructed jury could (not would) find the defendant guilty. It is a very low-level test. The majority of committal proceedings result in a committal to trial. In some jurisdictions the prosecuting authority may directly present a defendant for trial regardless of the result of the committal proceedings by filing an ex officio indictment. Equally, the prosecuting authority usually has the power to stop any prosecution by entering a nolle prosequi. In many jurisdictions the right of a defendant to cross-examine witnesses during the committal is reliant on the defence establishing that it is in the interests of justice or to illuminate some relevant point. The defence very rarely calls witnesses at a committal. England On 28 May 2013 the committal procedure was abolished in England. As a result, the serious matters are sent straight to the Crown Court from the Magistrates' Court for a pre-trial hearing. There is no committal procedure to determine sufficiency of evidence. Instead, the defendant charged with the offence may make an application to the Crown Court to have the case dismissed for lack of evidence. The idea behind this reform was to get cases to trial more quickly and reduce the number of pre-trial hearings. However, it is questionable whether this has been achieved given the number of pre-trial hearings that are often required in the Crown Court. The first hearing in the Crown Court will be a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH), where a plea is taken and, if not guilty, a timetable for trial is set and directions given for service of further evidence, followed by the trial itself. There may be additional hearings in between (called 'mentions'). The PTPH was introduced on 5 January 2016https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure- rules/criminal/docs/october-2015/cm007-eng.pdf and replaced the previous procedure of having a separate initial Preliminary hearing followed by a Plea and Case Management Hearing (PCMH) in an attempt to reduce the number of pre- trial hearings. In triable either way offences, the defendant's right to elect a jury trial remains unfettered.

They were mentioned in the various historical Indian inscriptions and ancient Indian and Tibetan literatures. They were native Indic peoples who were reported to have lived around Gandhara, Trigarta and Madra Kingdom, gorkha kingdom in the northern Indian subcontinent. People of this tribe includes Khas people of medieval Western Nepal, medieval Indian regions of Garhwal and Kumaon and Himachal zone as well as Khakha Rajputs of Kashmir. Names and variants The original spelling for the name in Sanskrit literature is Kha≈õa (Sanskrit: ‡§ñ‡§∂) while variants of name also used are Khasa (‡§ñ‡§∏), Kha·π£a (‡§ñ‡§∑) and Kha≈õƒ´ra (‡§ñ‡§∂‡•Ä‡§∞).  Indian sources  khas kingdom of nepal =Pre-historic literature= The Manusmriti states that the Khasas and several other tribes like the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Paradas, Daradas, Pahlavas, etc. were originally noble Kshatriyas, but later, due to their non- observance of valorous Kshatriya codes and neglect of chivalry, they had gradually sunken to the status of Mlechchas.Manu Samhita, X.43-44. Thus, it describes them as descendants of outcast Kshatriyas. The Bhagavata Purana describes them as a previously outcast group who redeemed themselves by adopting Vaishnavism. The Mahabharata mentions the Khasas as one of the northern tribes who fought on the side of the Kaurava against Satyaki. In the Karna Parva of Mahabharata, Khasas are mentioned living in the Panjab region between ƒÄra·π≠·π≠a and VasƒÅti: In the Sabhaparvan of the Mahabharata, they are mentioned between Meru and Mandara along with Kulindas and Tanganas. In Dronaparvan of the Mahabharata, they are mentioned with other northwestern tribes such as Daradas, Tanganas, Lampakas and Kulindas. The Vaishnava text Harivamsa describes that the Khasas were defeated by the King Sagara. The Markandeya Purana states that the Khasa is a country against the mountain. The Markandeya Purana, Vayu Purana and Kalki Purana describes that Khasas together with Sakas and other tribes have penetrated to the northwest of India. The Skanda Purana mentions the region of Himachal Pradesh and Kumaon-Garhwal as Kedare-Khasa-Mandale. Khas or Kus group, Goorkha, dominant tribe, Nipal =Medieval literature= Kashmir valley seen from space; \\"..the valley lying to the south and west of the Pir Panjal Range (white) which is surrounded by Jhelum river) in the west and Kishtwar in the east\\" as the expanse of Khasas as per the Nilamata Purana The Brihat Samhita authored by Indian polymath VarƒÅhamihira grouped Khasas with Kulutas, Kashmiras, Tanganas, and Kunatas. The Mudrarakshasa of Indian poet Vishakhadatta mentions that Khasas and Magadhas were Ganas (troops) in the army of Rakshasa and Malayaketu. According to an ancient Kashmiri text Nilamata Purana compiled by Indian scholar Ved Kumari Ghai, the Khasa tribe occupied This assertion is also corroborated by the later 12th century text Rajatarangini translated by British archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein. The Bharata NƒÅtya≈õƒÅstra by the Indian musicologist Bharata Muni mentions that the mother tongue language of Kha≈õas was BƒÅhliki language in the phrase The Kavyamimamsa of Rajashekhara mentions the Kuluta king with the title Khasadhipati. The inscription of Dadda II (also known as Pra≈õƒÅntarƒÅga) mentions about the Khasas in the phrase \\"...Yascopamiyate - sat - kataka - samunnata vidhyadharavasa taya Himachale na Khasa parivarataya.\\" A Jain literature Vasudevahindi by Sanghadasa narrates the travel of a merchant named Charudatta in the countries of Khasas, Hunas and Cinas. He further locates them at the northeastern direction of Indus river. Kus or Khas, Goorkha, dominant tribe, Nipal  European sources  Roman Geographer Pliny noted that E.T. Atkinson speculated that Pliny referred the terms, Cesi and Catriboni to Khasa and Kshatriya. Greek Geographer Ptolemy contended that the country of Khasas (referred as 'Khasia') was located near the Trans-Himalayan range of Northwest India.  Tibetan sources  The Mongolian-Tibetan historian Sumpa Yeshe Peljor (writing in the 18th century) lists the Khasas alongside other peoples found in Central Asia since antiquity, including the Yavanas (Greeks), Kambojas, Tukharas, Hunas and Daradas.Sumpa Yeshe Peljor's 18th century work Dpag-bsam-ljon-bzah (Tibetan title) may be translated as \\"The Excellent Kalpavriksha\\"): \\"Tho-gar yul da≈Ñ yabana da≈Ñ Kambodza da≈Ñ Khasa [sic] da≈Ñ Huna da≈Ñ Darta da≈Ñ...\\" Pag-Sam-Jon-Zang (1908), I.9, Sarat Chandra Das; Ancient Kamboja, 1971, p 66, H. W. Bailey.  Descendants  Irish linguist Sir G.A. Grierson asserted that \\"..the great mass of the Aryan speaking population of the lower Himalaya from Kashmir to Darjeeling is inhabited by tribes descended from the ancient Khasas of Mahabharata.\\" =Khasas under Malla rule= Khasas are thought to be connected to the medieval Khasa Malla kingdom and the modern Khas people of Nepal. The modern Khas people of Nepal have also been connected with the ancient Khasas, although their period of migration in Nepal remains ambiguous. In Nepal the Khas people first settled around present day Humla and Jumla. The Khasa kings of Nepal formed the famous Malla Kingdom, which ruled Humla from the eleventh century before collapsing and splintering into local chiefdoms during the fourteenth century. The Khasas (identified with Khasa Mallas) are also mentioned in several Indian inscriptions dated between 8th and 13th centuries CE. The 954 AD Khajuraho Inscription of Dha·πága states Khasa kingdom equivalent to Gauda of Bengal and Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty. The Nalanda inscription of Devapala and Bhagalpur; copper plate of Narayanapala also mentions about Khasas. The three copper plates from Pandukeshavara explains the territories of Khasas. =Khasas of Kashmir= The 12th-century text Rajatarangini translated by British archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein links the Khasas with northwestern affiliations. It describes at Rajatarangini describes the rulers of Rajapuri (modern Rajauri) as the \\"lord of the Khasas\\". It also describes the chiefs of the Lohara as Khasas. The Khasa chiefs of Rajapuri freely intermarried with Kshatriya rulers of Kashmir while the Khasa chief of Lohara, Simharaja, married a daughter of Shahi Kings of Kabul. The descendants of the royal family of Rajauri later became Muslim Rajput chiefs and they retained the rulership of the territory till 19th century. Stein also identified the modern Khakhas as descdendants of Khasas mentioned in the Rajatarangini.

Opened in 1973, the mall is currently managed and co-owned by The Macerich Company, a real estate investment trust, and is anchored by Macy's, Nordstrom, JCPenney, and Dick's Sporting Goods.

Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. a developer bought by Safeco in 1967. It was to be a development with space for 100 stores. The mall was to include over on in an L-shaped pattern. On August 16, 1973, Meier & Frank became the first tenant to open at the mall. Sears and Lipman's then opened that November, followed by Liberty House and Nordstrom during the summer of 1974. The grand opening of the facility began on February 21, 1974. It is located southwest of Portland in an area known as Progress, which at the time was entirely unincorporated and located between the cities of Beaverton and Tigard. The west side of the mall in 1988, before expansion filled in this area In April 1978, the Liberty House store, located on the mall's north side, was taken over by Frederick & Nelson (F&N;). The following year, Frederick & Nelson acquired the entire Lipman's chain, and in connection with that acquisition, F&N; moved within the mall from the space it had occupied for only one year to the much larger ex-Lipman's space, on the mall's west side. Mervyn's took over the space vacated by F&N; and originally occupied by Liberty House, opening its store in October 1979. In 1986, the cities of Beaverton, Tigard, and Portland fought to annex the unincorporated territory on which the mall was located. Tigard was awarded the right to annex Washington Square along with other adjacent properties that contain Lincoln Center and the Embassy Suites Hotel. Following Frederick & Nelson's bankruptcy and store closure in January 1991, Nordstrom acquired the vacant space and demolished it, constructing a larger replacement for its existing store; this new Nordstrom opened in 1994. At that time, the former Nordstrom space was acquired by the mall and reconfigured as a food court and additional retail space, coinciding with the renovation of the mall. By the mid-1990s the mall had an average sales per square foot that placed it in the top 10% of malls nationwide. The mall's northwest corner in 2015. At left is the portion of Macy's, formerly Meier & Frank, that has been in operation since the mall's opening in 1973. At right is the 2005 addition. In December 1998, the mall was sold by Safeco, a Seattle-headquartered insurance company, to a partnership of The Macerich Company and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP); at the time of the sale Washington Square was \\"one of the most productive malls on the West Coast\\", with sales approaching $500 per square foot. Macerich, a Real Estate Investment Trust, took over management of the property. In 2005, Macerich opened a addition, housing 30 more stores (including The Cheesecake Factory, Sephora, Godiva Chocolatier, and Williams Sonoma). At the same time, other improvements were made throughout the mall and two new parking structures were added. Mervyn's closed in November 2005 and their location, which they owned, was sold to the mall. The site was refurbished and reopened as Dick's Sporting Goods in March 2008. The Sears store opened in 1973, as one of the mall's first tenants. In February 2011, Swedish clothing retailer H&M; opened their doors at Washington Square. It is the company's second location in Oregon. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 properties, including the Sears at Washington Square, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/9800-sw-washington-square- rd/3312688/landing On October 15, 2018, original anchor store Sears announced that their location at Washington Square would be closing as part of the chain's bankruptcy filing. Layout The current configuration has five department store anchors, 210 specialty shops & restaurants, and a food court. Some of the stores are located in an adjacent outdoor plaza known as \\"Square Too\\". Most of the mall is on a single level; however, the anchor stores have multiple levels, the food court is on a second level, and the expansion in 2005 was built so that it could accommodate a second-level addition at a later date.

A group of scientists invent, by accident, a device that detonates all nitrate-based explosive in its vicinity, thus providing good protection against most known modern conventional weapons.Review of The Trigger The first half of the book explores the reactions of society, government and the scientists themselves as the latter attempt to ensure that their invention will only be used for peaceful ends. Although at first beneficial, other uses for the device are found, such as a faultless at-range detonator. The novel also traces the scientists' slow progress in understanding the science behind their invention. The second half of the book begins when the science is sufficiently well understood that a second device can be built - one that does not detonate explosives, but merely renders them permanently harmless. The story ends with the scientists discovering that the hyperdimensional impulse wave can be set to scramble extremely specific DNA - making the device a killer.

The company was placed in voluntary liquidation on 3 February 2012.  Legal Issues  In December 2009, Tasair was speculated to be involved in charter flights hired by a PR firm for Japan's 'Institute of Cetacean Research' whaling company to spy on anti- whaling vessels, an action later condemned by the Australian Government and deemed illegal under a 2008 Australian Court order preventing any assistance to whaling operations.

Originally known as Cacaponville on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad because of its proximity to the mouth of the Little Cacapon River, the community's name was changed to Okonoko in the 1850s. In 1890, Okonoko had a permanent population of 46 and had both a post office and an express office in use on the railroad. When the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad lost favor as a mode of transportation of people and goods, Okonoko's residents relocated elsewhere for employment. The town's post office closed in 1958 and its mail was routed through nearby Paw Paw. Today, Okonoko consists of several residences that date from the start of the 20th century which are now used as second vacation homes. Okonoko has become a popular recreational area for hunting, fishing, and boating on the Potomac River. Okonoko can be reached from Levels by Levels-Okonoko Road (County Route 5/6) or Bright's Hollow Road (County Route 5/5) and from Little Cacapon by Okonoko-Little Cacapon Road (County Route 2/7).

It extends east- to-west from the Cuyahoga River to the city of Brooklyn and north-to-south from the Brookside Park Valley to the city of Parma.  History  The first instance of European habitation in the Old Brooklyn vicinity occurred in 1790, when fur trader Joseph Du Shattar established a trading post on the west bank of the Cuyahoga River, across from the area that became Newburgh. Originally a portion of Brooklyn Township, the area was settled permanently in 1814 as the hamlet of Brighton, centered at the present-day intersection of Pearl and Broadview Roads. The Brighton area was incorporated as South Brooklyn Village in 1889 and then annexed with other surrounding villages by the City of Cleveland during the years of 1905‚Äì1927. During the late 1880s, farmers in Old Brooklyn's Schaaf Road area (also known as South Hills) and the neighboring Village of Brooklyn Heights were among the first in the Midwest to use greenhouses to cultivate vegetables. By the 1920s the neighborhood was one of the nation's leading producers of greenhouse vegetables, with more than under glass. Most of the greenhouses were displaced, beginning about 1960, by new housing and the construction of Ohio Rt. 176 (Jennings Freeway). Commercial development in Old Brooklyn reached its apex during the period of 1920‚Äì1960. Shopping districts spread along Pearl, Broadview, and State Roads and were followed, after World War II, by the development of shopping plazas at the intersections of Memphis-Fulton, Broadview-Brookpark, and Pearl-Brookpark. The original Honey Hut ice cream shop, a favorite of many West-siders,according to whom? can be found on State Road near the south end of the community. The most ambitious period of residential construction extended from the early 20th century to the 1950s. During the 1980s and 1990s, residential development experienced a resurgence, particularly in the South Hills and Jennings Road areas. Housing values in Old Brooklyn, today, are among the highest within Cleveland proper.  Landmarks  Old Brooklyn's most notable landmark, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, was created in 1907 when Cleveland's Park Board relocated the Zoo from University Circle on Cleveland's east side to Brookside Park. The 145-acre park lies entirely within Old Brooklyn and is one of the 16 nature preserve reservations of the Cleveland Metroparks system. Brookside Park also has a place in sporting lore, having hosted the reputedly largest baseball crowd in Cleveland's history, when the White Autos of Cleveland met Omaha in the World Amateur Baseball Championship. On October 10, 1915, a reported crowd of 115,000 sprawled along and below the park's northern bluff, directly west of today's Fulton Road Bridge, and cheered as the home team seized the day. The Jeremiah Gates Home, built in 1820 and located at 3506 Memphis Avenue, is believed to be the oldest residence in Old Brooklyn. Other notable landmarks include the Brooklyn-Brighton Bridge, the Estabrook Recreation Center, and the Italian Gothic-style Our Lady of Good Counsel Church (now called Mary Queen of Peace) atop Pearl Road Hill. The new Fulton Road Bridge  Natives of Old Brooklyn  The neighborhood's secondary students generally attend James Ford Rhodes High School, whose graduates include 1944 Heisman Trophy winner Les Horvath, anti-establishment poet d.a. levy, and television star Drew Carey. The Drew Carey Show's \\"Warsaw Tavern\\" was patterned after a bar near the Memphis-Fulton intersection, which hosts one of the highest concentrations of bars and restaurants in Greater Cleveland. Another Old Brooklyn native, the late Mary Strassmeyer, was a gossip columnist for the Cleveland News and The Plain Dealer. Drew Carey, 2008  Demographics  Old Brooklyn encompasses all of Cleveland's Ward 13, and the southwestern portion of Ward 12. Its population, according to the 2010 census, was 32,009.  Recent and Future Developments  The Treadway Creek Greenway Restoration project, completed in 2008, restored and preserved of riparian corridor and open space along Treadway Creek. The project included the construction of a multi-purpose trail connecting Harmody Park to the Ohio and Erie Canal National Heritage Corridor's Towpath Trail. Other plans include a connector linking the Towpath Trail with the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, as well as transit service and streetscape improvements.  Boundaries  Old Brooklyn is bounded on the north by Interstate 71 and by Denison Ave. The western boundary is Ridge Road, the southern is Brookpark Road, and the eastern is the Cuyahoga River and State Route 176 (the Jennings Freeway). Most of Old Brooklyn's northern and eastern borders are with other neighborhoods of the city of Cleveland, while some of its western boundary is with the city of Brooklyn. Its southern boundary is largely with the city of Parma, though it also shares a short border with Brooklyn Heights.

Founded in 1831, the school claims to be Australia's oldest independent school; and is situated on a campus. In the western suburbs of Sydney, the School has about 2,100 students from kindergarten to Year 12 and about 430 boarders from Years 5‚Äì12, making it one of the largest boarding schools in Australia. It is Australia's oldest boarding school. The school is affiliated with the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), and the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA). It is a G30 School and is a founding member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS).  History  In January 1830, the archdeacon of New South Wales, William Grant Broughton, devised a plan for the establishment of grammar schools in the colony under the governorship of Sir Ralph Darling. The Duke of Wellington assisted in securing royal patronage, the text of which stated that with the authority of King George IV such schools would be named \\"The King's Schools\\". It is said, although no documentation exists, that royal sanction was granted by King William IV. Two schools were opened in 1832: the first in Pitt Street, Sydney, the other in George Street, Parramatta, inland. The former, opened in January, closed eight months later after the death of its first headmaster, while the Parramatta campus remained open under the stewardship of Robert Forrest, who was appointed headmaster in 1831. According to The King's School 1831‚Äì1981, on opening day, Monday, 13 February 1832, with a handful of pupils. Forrest was paid a salary of ¬£100 per annum, but it was inclusive of a land and housing grant. From fees of ¬£28 and ¬£8 per annum for boarders and day pupils respectively he was expected to maintain boarders and pay the salaries of his assistants, whose fees were ¬£4 per annum for each pupil taught. According to an article in the Australian Historical Society Journal in 1903, enrolment reached over 100 pupils before the end of the first year. By 1839, Forrest's health had deteriorated and he submitted his resignation. Ill-health caused the school to experience a rapid succession of headmasters in the following decade. William Clarke was appointed headmaster to replace Forrest, and John Troughton was appointed master in charge of boarders. Two years later W. W. Simpson became headmaster, but an epidemic of scarlet fever in 1843 forced his resignation. James Walker, a notable botanist and classical scholar, succeeded Simpson, but ill-health resulted in his resignation in December 1847. In 1848 Forrest returned to the school, which had now had 60 pupils, but he was again forced to resign due to illness in September 1853. In July 1854, Thomas Druitt was appointed headmaster and established military drill in April 1855, a compulsory subject overseen by W. Bamford. Druitt had been under the impression that his appointment was permanent and he refused to relinquish his position upon the arrival of his replacement, Frederick Armitage, in January 1855. It was not until the intervention of Bishop Frederic Barker in May 1855 that Druitt agreed to stand down. Under the helm of Armitage, the school experienced a protracted period of expansion in facilities and enrolments, due to his significant wealth, which allowed him to pay for many of the improvements personally. The number of pupils increased to nearly 200, 150 of whom were boarders. Pupils studied for seven hours per day in summer and six hours in winter. As well as religious holidays, there were two official school holidays per year, including a mid-winter vacation from 15 June to 15 July, and a mid-summer vacation from 24 December to 31 January. In 1859 Armitage adopted school arms similar to those of The King's School Canterbury in England, which according to The King's School 1831‚Äì1981, was due to the erroneous assumption that the Australian school was named after the English one. He applied for leave in 1862 to attend to his ill wife and to obtain a mathematics degree at the University of Cambridge, but he never returned. By the end of his tenure, he had raised the standard and quality of education to a high level. The acting headmaster appointed prior to Armitage's departure, LJ Trollope, saw a drastic contraction in the number of pupils to just 10 by June 1864, resulting in the closure of the school. There are varying accounts as to the reasons underpinning the school's rapid and sudden decline, including the school's poor financial situation, the dilapidated buildings and competition from other schools, while The King's School 1831‚Äì1981 claims that it was a series of successive rainstorms causing the collapse of the schoolroom roof that forced its closure. Other accounts have blamed Armitage as lacking the discipline to continue as headmaster. The Australian Dictionary of Biography argues that while the departure of Armitage was not ideal, \\"a headmastership devoid of endowment or guaranteed salary in a colonial school without a council or adequate financial support could hardly have been attractive to a scholarly English gentleman.\\" The school reopened in January 1869 with George Fairfowl Macarthur as Headmaster. Macarthur had been a pupil at The King's School during its early years.  Campus  The King's School originally rented Harrisford House in George Street, Parramatta, near the wharves on Parramatta River. The school soon outgrew its campus in George Street, and following a submission to the Crown, it was provided with land and premises further upriver in Parramatta, close to the Government House. The school remained there for 130 years until August 1968 when it completed its relocation to the current site in North Parramatta, originally Gowan Brae, the family residence and property of James Burns, co-founder of Burns Philp and Company. Since the relocation, the school maintained a site, while other sections of Gowan Brae were sold to Redeemer Baptist School and Tara Anglican School for Girls, with as well as the NSW Synod of the Uniting Church as the Uniting Theological College. A further section was sold for residential development, now the locality of Kingsdene in the suburb of Carlingford. A small patch of land is still owned by Burns and his descendants, and this is for the family cemetery at the centre of the Senior School. The senior school (years 7‚Äì12) is located on the east of the property, while the preparatory school (K‚Äì6) is located on the west of the property. Within the senior school, there are extensive facilities, including the Centre for Learning and Leadership, dining hall and separate buildings for visual arts, music, science, drama, agriculture, PDHPE and industrial design and technology. Futter Hall, the main school hall, and the staff centre adjacent to it are other facilities present in the academic precinct, known as 'the Quadrangle'. There are 35 classrooms, all equipped with audio-visual and computer facilities. The school theatre was renovated in June 2010, adding a second smaller theatre and drama classrooms. The school also opened its new $20 million science centre in March 2014, which includes classrooms and labs where students can work with collaboratively with researchers from The University of Sydney. Sporting facilities include 15 playing fields used for both cricket and rugby union, 14 tennis courts, 12 basketball courts (nine outdoor, three indoor), 7 football fields, a 50-metre lap pool, a 25-metre swimming pool, a diving pool, and a gym under which there is an indoor rifle range. The Sports Centre opened in 2007 and includes two basketball courts, a fully equipped gym and fitness centre, and PDHPE classrooms. The school also has a rowing facility in Putney on the Parramatta River. There are also a number of boarding houses for students who reside at the school, and private residences adjacent to the boarding houses for teachers and their families who provide pastoral care for these boys. Other features of the school include an agricultural yard, greenhouse, a dam, vineyard, bamboo forest, a mountain biking course, and a number of heritage landmarks.  House system  = Senior school = The Centre for Learning and Leadership, which includes a library, an auditorium, computer laboratories and classrooms Until 2011 the school had 14 houses, for both day students and boarders. The boarding houses comprised Gowan Brae, Baker, Bishop Barker, Broughton, Forrest, Hake Harris, Macarthur and Waddy, and the day student houses Britten, Burkitt, Dalmas, Kurrle, Macquarie and Wickham. In that year, the school made a number of changes to its house system, which now consists of six-day houses and five boarding houses. The boarding houses include Gowan Brae, Baker-Hake, Bishop Barker-Harris, Broughton-Forrest, Macarthur-Waddy, and the day student houses include Britten, Burkitt, Dalmas, Kurrle, Macquarie and Wickham. The houses are hubs for students' recreational and pastoral activities. During the course of a year, inter-house competitions take place where students earn points for their respective house by competing in events. The winning house at the end of the year receives the King's Cup. Kurrle and Wickham were created as a result of an expansion in enrolments in 2001, and the remaining Houses have been in existence for several decades. Their names are derived from former Headmasters and Deputy Headmasters, the founder of the school (Broughton), and the traditional name of the school site (Gowan Brae). = Preparatory school = The preparatory school has four houses: Stiles, Thomas, Blaxland and Harrison. Blaxland includes both boarders and day students, and boarders are housed within Gowan Brae, which is shared with Year 7 students. Each year there are competitions between the four houses such as athletics competitions and swimming carnivals. Gowan Brae serves as an intermediate step between primary and secondary schooling, allowing Year 7 students the opportunity to adapt to the unique institutions of the senior school while remaining within a common peer group of similar age. King's also operates a small co-educational preparatory boarding school, Tudor House, in Moss Vale, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales approximately 100 kilometers away from the North Parramatta campus site.  Uniform  The school uniform is the oldest military uniform still worn in Australia.. It consists of navy blue trousers with a vertical red stripe, a white shirt, black shoes, and a jacket made of a black and white woollen material, stitched in a birdseye pattern. It has red cuffs and red tabs on each side of the collar. The cuffs and epaulets are each surmounted by a braided red \\"Lovers' Knot\\". The uniform reflects the military history of the school, and is similar to the blazers worn at the Battle of Waterloo. William Archer Gunn and fellow King's students in uniform, c. 1931 The jacket may be modified in a number of ways. Military insignia can be stitched onto the right arm to show rank in the Australian Army Cadets, a white lanyard may be worn by members of the Marching Band, and the Regimental Sergeant Major may wear the Coat of Arms on the left arm. Cadet Under Officers wear a different grey jacket, which has diamond lozenges on the shoulder tabs and a silver braided 'Lover's Knot'. All students except the monitors wear one badge on a red tab on the right collar of the jacket. This is because students of lower rank would have carried rifles over one shoulder, thus damaging the additional badge, while monitors would instead be armed with pistols. House monitors wear one badge each side and school monitors wear one badge on each side with blue collar tabs. The school captain wears one crown on each blue collar tab. All the buttons are silver in colour, and are manufactured by Stokes & Sons(now Stokes Badges). In Years 11 and 12 students are allowed to wear a white pin-striped navy blue blazer (known as a butchers coat) or a sky- blue \\"honours blazer\\". Both blazers have pockets that may have special stitching commemorating academic, sporting or cultural achievements in the form of honours, full or half colours. Outstanding achievement is rewarded by honours colours and is signified by the sky-blue blazer and gold embroidery on the blazer's pocket. Full colours are represented by white embroidery and half colours are shown by dark blue embroidery on the pocket of the pin-striped navy blue blazer. The grey jacket and blazers must be worn with a standard black tie commemorating the death of Queen Victoria (although this was temporarily substituted in 2007 during the 175th anniversary by a navy-blue silk tie, with the King's crest and the number 175 scattered on it). The preparatory school uniform differs slightly from that of the senior school. Students from Kindergarten to Year 2 wear navy-blue shorts with the vertical red stripe, knee-high black socks and a white pin-striped navy blue (butchers coat) blazer, while students from Years 3‚Äì6 wear the same shorts and socks, but with the grey blazer of the senior school.  Co-curricular activities  Co-curricular activities offered by the school include debating, choir, theatre, bands and ensembles, sport, and the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Clubs for senior students (the Twelve Club, the Cartesian Club, the Scipionic Circle, and the Tom Barrett Society) meet once a month, to discuss the current affairs and present papers on topical issues. The school produces at least one musical and two drama productions each year. Productions have included Les Mis√©rables, The Pirates of Penzance, South Pacific, Guys and Dolls, Fiddler on the Roof, My Fair Lady, The Mikado, Grease, Jesus Christ Superstar (2015), Addams Family (2016), A Fleeting Night's Dream (2017) and We Will Rock You (2018) The Producers (2019) Grease (2020). = Academic clubs = The headmaster, deputy headmaster, and other senior staff host intellectual clubs composed of promising senior students. The clubs include the Twelve Club, hosted by the Headmaster, The Cartesian Club hosted by the Deputy Headmaster, the Scipionic Circle, hosted by the Director of Student Services, and the Tom Barrett Society, hosted by the school Registrar. The members of these clubs are selected for their success in areas of academics, leadership and character. = Debating = The preparatory school competes in the IPSHA and ISDA debating competitions, and the senior school in the GPS and ISDA competitions. The school won the ISDA competition, the largest independent schools competition in NSW, for the first time in 2004. The school was represented by national and world championship winning representative teams in 2004. = Cadet corps = The cadet corps's annual passing-out parade on the JS White Oval. The school chapel is in the background. Founded in 1868, the cadet corps vies with Newington CollegeAustralian Army Cadets as the oldesthttp://www.lancers.org.au/site/The_Military_at_Parramatta.asp in Australia. All students in Years 9 and 10 are required to undergo cadet training, during which they are taught survival techniques, abseiling, map- reading, marching, and other skills. Each year the annual field exercise, or \\"Corps Camp\\", is held at the Singleton Military Area. The Corps is regarded as the largest unit from any single school, however is just surpassed by one other Unit, made up of several schools. The Cadet Corps holds an annual passing-out parade, which commemorates the departure of the Year 12 members and the transfer of student leadership to Year 11 through the handing over of the unit colours. It is usually presided over by a high-ranking member of the Australian Defence Force. The King's School Marching Band is a central element of the cadet corps. The Band consists mainly of members of the School's Symphonic Band; it marches annually at the ANZAC Day Parade in central Sydney. The Band is overseen and directed in partnership with the Music Department, and incorporated into two platoons under the Cadet Corps command structure. There is an annual appointee to the position of Drum Major ‚Äì generally a year 12 boy who demonstrates musical skill and leadership capacities. = Music = The school has a music program that caters for a range of musical abilities, held in the sesquicentenary music building. Music at the school forms part of the curricula and co-curricula programs. The school has two pipe organs: a chapel organ in the memorial chapel and a large baroque pipe organ in Futter Hall. Curriculum Year 7 students complete the mandatory 100-hour Board of Studies (NSW) music course, which introduces them to basic concepts of music in a variety of styles. Year 7 boys participate in a singing program and undertake a theory exam toward the end of the year. As part of the Year 8‚Äì10 elective program, students can continue to study music in these years. They are required to learn an instrument as part of this course and regular performance assessments take place. For the HSC, students can continue their music studies in either the Music 1 or Music 2 courses, with the option of choosing Music Extension as well. Music 1 and 2 cover a variety of music styles, however, the Music 2 course has a focus on Western art music. Recently the school has been successful in this field, with a number of student performances and compositions nominated for ENCORE. Co-curricular program The school has seven large Wind Bands, which form the core of the Wind, Brass and Percussion program. The Symphonic Band is the school's elite level band and is composed of musicians typically studying AMEB or Trinity Grade 7 and above. The Wind Orchestra is the middle ensemble within the senior school, whilst Gowan Brae Band is a special ensemble for year 7 students only, which receives extra attention and allows students to develop their talents intensively upon their arrival at King's. The marching band includes members of the Symphonic Band who are enrolled as cadets in The King's School cadet corps. In the Preparatory school, the Concert Band, Wind Ensemble and Junior Band complete the 3-12 wind bands program. The school also runs three stage bands, and numerous other jazz and chamber ensembles for Wind and Brass players. The King's School is particularly renowned for its 'Drumline', a percussion ensemble in the American tradition in which outstanding percussion students perform memorised precision drumming routines, in military-style formation. The school has a chamber string orchestra for experienced players. There is a non-auditioned choir for boys in the senior school, and the auditioned Schola Cantorum (Latin: meaning \\"school of singers\\"); both ensembles are in four vocal parts. In the preparatory school there are three choirs consisting of trebles and altos. A number of small ensembles exist including piano trios, guitar ensembles, percussion ensembles, flute ensembles, clarinet quartet, saxophone quintet and a number of popular music bands. Instrumental lessons Full and half-period instrumental lessons are offered in piano, pipe organ, guitar, violin, viola, violoncello, contrabass, tuba, horn, trombone, trumpet, saxophone, flute, clarinet, percussion (orchestral and drum-kit), bagpipes, and voice, are available. The school has a variety of music tutors. Regular concerts and events The Music Department conducts a number of regular events each year, including the annual Festival of Lessons and Carols, Gala Concert, ensembles concerts, and studio recitals for individual performances. Most events are held in either the Recital Room (part of the Sesquicentenary music building) or Futter Hall. = Sport = Sport is compulsory for all students. Senior school students must participate in one of rugby union, association football, or cross country in winter, and rowing, cricket, basketball, tennis, athletics or swimming in summer. If personally selected by the sportsmaster, students may represent the school at shooting outside their regular sporting commitments. Students may participate in a sport in which they have achieved excellence (deemed by the sportsmaster). Cricket, rugby union, association football, basketball and tennis is also available at the preparatory school. The school engages in these sports as a member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales) with other schools: Saint Ignatius' College, St Joseph's College, Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Grammar School, Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore), Newington College, The Scots College and The Armidale School. King's School eight-oar crew, 1932 Rugby union The school was instrumental in the development of rugby union in Australia, playing in the first inter-school game against Newington College in 1870. The school has produced 28 Wallabies and four of them have been captains. In 1880 members of the school rugby team also participated in the first recorded soccer match in Sydney against the Wanderers Club. On their 1888 tour of New Zealand and Australia, the British and Irish Lions drew against a team from the school. The rugby union 1st XV has won several GPS Premierships in recent years, including those in 1997‚Äì2000, 2002, 2008, 2009 and 2018. The team won the 2000 Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament in Japan. Current and recent Wallabies Stirling Mortlock, Benn Robinson, Dean Mumm, Nick Phipps and Julian Huxley are former students of the school. Other former students including Ben Batger, Daniel Halangahu, Will Caldwell, James Hilgendorf, Ben Hand, Tom Carter, Mitchell Chapman, Hugh Perrett, Lalakai Foketi, Guy Millar and Tim Davidson play in the Super Rugby competition. Greg Jeloudev and Dylan Pietsch play for Australia in the World Rugby Sevens Series. Daniel Conn plays rugby league for the Sydney Roosters in the NRL. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on 19 May 2016 that RSPCA Australia was investigating alleged cruelty to sheep after a video was posted on Facebook showing members of the school's teams tackling older rams around a paddock. The principal of the school likened it to \\"shearing\\".

A serial cable is a cable used to transfer information between two devices using a serial communication protocol. The form of connectors depends on the particular serial port used. A cable wired for connecting two DTEs directly is known as a null modem cable. Maximum cable lengths The maximum working length of a cable varies depending on the characteristics of the transmitters and receivers, the baud rate on the cable, and the capacitance and electrical impedance of the cable. The RS-232 standard states that a compliant port must provide defined signal characteristics for a capacitive load of pF. This does not correspond to a fixed length of cable since varying cables have different characteristics. Empirically tested combinations of bit rate, serial ports, cable type, and lengths may provide reliable communications, but generally RS-232-compatible ports are intended to be connected by, at the most, a few tens of metres of cable. Other serial communications standards are better adapted to drive hundreds or thousands of metres of cable.

It consists of arrangements of folk music from various countries and other songs, forming \\"a tribute to the extraordinary artistry\\" of the American singer Cathy Berberian, a specialist in Berio's music. It is scored for voice, flute (doubling on piccolo), clarinet, harp, viola, cello, and percussion (two players). The composer arranged it for a large orchestra in 1973. These program notes also contain a full set of lyrics with English translations. Background Two of the songs in the cycle, \\"La donna ideale\\" and \\"Ballo\\", were composed in 1947 by Berio during his second year at the Milan Conservatory for voice and piano as part of his Tre canzoni popolari (Three folk songs). It is often claimed that these three songs were written for Cathy Berberian while she was studying in Italy, but this cannot be the case because she did not arrive there until 1949. The Folk Songs cycle was commissioned by Mills College in California and first performed there by a chamber orchestra directed by Berio in 1964 with Berberian as the soprano soloist. By the time of its first performance, the Berberian‚ÄìBerio marriage was nearing its end, but their artistic partnership continued; they subsequently collaborated on works such as Sequenza III, Visage and Recital I (for Cathy). Berio had an emotional attachment to folk song: he once declared that \\"When I work with that music I am always caught by the thrill of discovery.\\" Other later compositions by Berio that incorporated folk songs were Cries of London, Coro and Voci: Folk Songs II. Songs The first two of the Folk Songs are not actual folk songs. \\"Black Is the Colour (Of My True Love's Hair)\\" and \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" were both written by the Kentucky folk singer and composer John Jacob Niles. There is a traditional tune for \\"Black is the Color ...\\" but, because his father thought it was \\"downright terrible\\", Niles recalled, \\"I wrote myself a new tune, ending it in a nice modal manner.\\" Berio's suite opens with the viola instructed to play \\"like a wistful country dance fiddler\\", free of bar lines and rhythmically independent of the voice. \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" was developed by Niles out of the mere three lines he was able to extract from a revivalist preacher‚Äôs daughter, \\"a tousled, unwashed blond, and very lovely\\". Harmonics from the viola, cello and harp contribute toward the \\"hurdy-gurdy sound\\" Berio wanted to accompany this second song. The extended bird-song postlude for flute and clarinet in Berio‚Äôs version seems to have been suggested by the passing reference to the \\"bird on the wing\\". Armenia, the country of Berberian's ancestors, provided the third song, \\"Loosin yelav\\", which describes the rising of the moon. In the French song \\"Rossignolet du bois\\", accompanied only by the clarinet at first but later by the harp and crotales, a nightingale advises an inquiring lover to sing his serenades two hours after midnight, and identifies the \\"apples\\" in his garden as the moon and the sun. A sustained chord colored by the striking of automobile spring coils bridges this song to the next one, the old Sicilian song \\"A la femminisca\\", sung by fishermen's wives as they wait at the docks. Like the first two songs, the sixth, \\"La Donna Ideale\\", and the seventh, \\"Ballo\\", come not from anonymous folk bards but from Berio himself (see background section above). The old Genoese dialect folk poem \\"The Ideal Woman\\" says that if you find a woman at once well-born, well-mannered, well-formed and with a good dowry, for God's sake don't let her get away. \\"The Ball\\", another old Italian poem, says that the wisest of men lose their heads over love, but love resists the sun and ice and all else. \\"Motettu de tristura\\" comes from SardiniaSalvatore Cambosu, Miele amaro, Firenze, Vallecchi, 1954, 176‚Äì177; Giulio Fara, L'anima della Sardegna: la musica tradizionale, Roma, Istituto delle Edizioni Accademiche, 1940, 58: in Giulio Angioni, L'usignolo triste, in Tutti dicono Sardegna, Cagliari-Sassari, EDeS, 1990, 116‚Äì119 and apostrophizes the nightingale: \\"How you resemble me as I weep for my lover... When they bury me, sing me this song.\\" The next two songs are also found in Joseph Canteloube's Chants d'Auvergne and are in the Occitan language. \\"Malurous qu'o uno fenno\\" poses the eternal marital paradox: he with no spouse seeks one, and he with one wishes he had none. A cello echoing the improvisation at the opening of the suite introduces \\"Lo F√Øolair√©\\", in which a girl at her spinning wheel sings of exchanging kisses with a shepherd. Berberian discovered the last song, known in the suite as \\"Azerbaijan Love Song\\", on a 78 RPM record from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, sung in the Azerbaijani language except for one verse in Russian, which a Russian- speaking friend told her compared love to a stove. Berberian sang, purely by rote, the sounds she transcribed as best she could from that scratchy old record. She knew not one word of Azerbaijani.

The school began as the two classrooms for children of expatriates in the Holy Redeemer School and was given its current name when it moved into its own building in 1963. In 1966, it changed from the British to the American system. In August 1992, the school moved to a 14-acre campus in the suburban district of Minburi. The school has been ranked among the top five international schools in Thailand. RIS was one of the first schools in Asia to be accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Thai Ministry of Education. RIS is also a member of the East Asia Regional Council of Overseas Schools (EARCOS) and the Council of International Schools (CIS). Ruamrudee is Thai for \\"union of hearts,\\" which captures the school's vision of welcoming all children into an environment of care and compassion. RIS attempts to utilize a progressive, innovative approach to education; emphasizing on global citizenship and character development in a multicultural community. Curriculum RIS offers a college preparatory American curriculum. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), the Thai Ministry of Education, and the Association of Indian Universities. RIS is also a member of the East Asia Regional Council of Overseas Schools (EARCOS) and the Council of International Schools (CIS). It is certified to award the International Baccalaureate diploma since May 1998, and the traditional US high school diploma. It also offers advanced placement credits. Being a Catholic school, Ruamrudee offers monthly mass on the first Thursday of each month from 7:30 - 8:00, as well a religion course in Middle and High school. Facilities RIS is equipped with a 100-meters by 50-meters FIFA-certified artificial turf football pitch, an Olympic sized swimming pool and a normal pool, multiple gymnasiums, two libraries, a performing arts center, multiple mini-theaters, an art gallery, and computer and science labs. =Libraries= RIS features two main libraries, Elizabeth and Griffith. The two libraries contain more than 100,000 print, electronic, and audiovisual materials. Each library is supported by a knowledgeable, certified librarian and staff along with quiet study locations for students. The Elizabeth library caters to PreK‚Äìgrade 5 students with books and resources on topics ranging from general interest to contemporary popular fiction. ES students are encouraged to search for engaging books at just the right reading level to support their literacy development. The library provides many kid-friendly genres and titles crucial to their development. Middle school and high school students, however, prefer to use the Griffith library as it provides greater space for working and a greater variety of books. The Griffith Library serves grade 6‚Äì12 students, with well over 50,000 books, 70 periodicals, and multiple online resources that span an enormous range of fiction, nonfiction, and reference materials. Currently, the Griffith library is undergoing renovation with an expected completion date of January 2020. A temporary location for the library has been established in an existing 'book room' near the tennis court. The library features two floors with the second also being used for the class, Academic Research, instructed by librarian, Mr. Garrett Drake. The library also provides the students with board games. =Gym= RIS offers free gym access to students and faculties. The gym is equipped with multiple cardio machines including treadmills, cycling machine, step machine, etc. Furthermore, multiple sets of weights and weight machines for upper body and lower body exercise are available. Students who seek to use the gym must be dresses in gym-appropriate clothing. A water dispenser is available within the gym, however, the gym does not provide cups. Students and faculties are expected to provide themselves with water containers. Although water fountains are located throughout the campus. The closest one is located outside the building itself. =Performing Arts Center (PAC)= The 300-seat, tiered Performing Arts Center (PAC) is where students present their band, choir, drama, and musical productions. The PAC is an space for showcasing student and faculty talent shows, the annual Easter and Christmas performances, and the TEDxYouth talks. The theater features a proscenium stage with mirrored practice rooms and two dressing rooms. The PAC has been used for the school's adaptation of musicals such as Bye Bye Birdie, Legally Blonde, and Once on This Island. Seasonal choirs showings are hosted throughout the year. Band performances are hosted throughout the year to present the progression band classes in school. =The Nest (CPD Room)= The Nest, previously known as the CPD room, is a conference room located above the high school portion of the canteen. Access to the room are located at the stair located in the canteen or through the second floor bridge on the second floor of the high school building. The octagonal room features rhombus-shaped tables that can be combined to create a hexagonal table. The Nest is often used for conferences and retreats for events such as Student Council or National Honors Society. =Maker Space/Middle School Workshop= The middle school workshop or the maker space is a place for students to explore themselves with new technology and workshop equipment. Students who seek to explore the field of STEM can take advantage of equipments such as 3d printers and wide screen TVs. Those who seek to engage in hands-on activities may enjoy exploring the workshop portion of the space. Equipments such as saws, hammer, nails, wooden planks, and other. Prior to the school year of 2017 - 2018, the maker space did not contain equipments of the same sort. Previously, the maker space provided students with games and gadgets such as connect four, jenga, knex, and perler beads. Although a 3d printer was available for use in the beginning, the machine had restricted usage. =Pools= RIS boasts two pools: Phoenix pool measures 25m x 50m‚Äîofficially Olympic size and concurrent with FINA standards; Godbout pool, a 25m pool, has an automatic salt-chlorination filter system. The Phoenix pool went through upgrades such as PVC lining, starter blocks for both short- and long-course events, a synthetic rubber pool deck, a scoreboard, a timing system with highly sensitive touchpads, and sails extending across the entire pool. =Mini-Theater (Redeemer)= The Mini-Theater, located on the 6th floor of Redeemer building, is a small movie theater used for showing of movies or videos.

Slanesville is located at the crossroads of Bloomery Pike (West Virginia Route 29) with Slanesville Pike (Hampshire County Route 3) and Cold Stream Road (Hampshire County Route 45/20). Slanesville Pike and Cold Stream Road formerly made up the Springfield Grade Road that ran from Capon Bridge to Springfield. According to the 2000 census, the Slanesville community has a population of 691.Slanesville, West Virginia ZIP code profile , DownloadZIPCode.com . Accessed 2008-01-19.  History  The community of Slanesville was earliest inhabited by generations of the Slain family in the late 18th century and upon its settlement it was known as Cross Roads because of its prime location at the meeting of the Martinsburg (old West Virginia Route 45) and Springfield (West Virginia Secondary Route 3) Grade Roads. Slanesville then took the name of Slain's Cross Roads after the prominence of the Slain family in the vicinity of the community. It was also misspelled as Slane's Cross Roads which would later influence its current name. Slanesville was then referred to as Dog Town because of the Slain family‚Äôs large number of dogs. Finally, the community was referred to as Slainsville and then Slanesville after Thomas Slain in the 1857 when a post office was established here. Slanes Knob (1,588 ft), located near Capon Bridge, is also named for the prominent Slain family in the area. Slanesville differed from its neighboring communities of Bloomery and North River Mills early on because it never became the center of major industry. Bloomery to its northeast was a center for iron smelting and blooming, while North River Mills, like its name suggests, was a center for mill production on North River. Slanesville was predominantly a farming community throughout most of its history and served as a popular stagecoach stop in the early 19th century along the Martinsburg and Springfield Grade Roads. The only signs of limited industry in Slanesville were two blacksmith shops run by the Hockman family and a cider mill. Later a store was erected close to the intersection of the Martinsburg and Springfield Grade Roads. The Old Henderson Store was purchased and operated by Glenn and Opal Heavner in the 1940s. When the ‚ÄúNew Road‚Äù, Route 45 (now Route 29) was cut the Heavners purchased land and built the ‚ÄúNew Store‚Äù, Heavner‚Äôs Grocery. The post office was then moved from its old location on Braddock Road at the old intersection and housed in a corner of the new store. The old store was torn down and the Heavners donated a portion of the land to the Slanesville Presbyterian Church. In the 1960s an addition to the store was added for a new post office. The store was sold in 1973 and has changed hands many times. It is now known as Slanesville General Store . A fire in the summer of 1955 cost the community three buildings and this led to the formation of the Slanesville Volunteer Fire Department that same year. The owners of Heavner's Grocery donated land adjacent to the store and the men and women of the community built the firehouse and community center. The Slanesville VFD is still located in the same \\"downtown\\" location. The Slanesville Presbyterian Church is also located in \\"downtown\\" across Slanesville Pike from the general store. The community‚Äôs Slanesville Elementary School along WV 29 south of town was host to President George H. W. Bush in April 1991 when he landed by helicopter in a field adjacent to the school to award Rae Ellen McKee the National Teacher of the Year award for 1991. A fifth grade remedial reading teacher, McKee was chosen from among the nation's more than 2.5 million elementary and secondary public school teachers.

The Project's mission states, \\"The Algebra Project, Inc. is a 501 (c) (3) national, nonprofit organization that uses mathematics as an organizing tool to ensure quality public school education for every child in America. We believe that every child has a right to a quality education to succeed in this technology-based society and to exercise full citizenship. We achieve this by using best educational research and practices, and building coalitions to create systemic changes.\\" (\\"Algebra Project\\") Founded by Civil Rights activist and Math educator Bob Moses in the 1980s, the Algebra Project has developed curricular materials, trained teachers and teacher-trainers, and provided ongoing professional development support and community involvement activities to schools seeking to achieve a systemic change in mathematics education. The Algebra Project reaches approximately 10,000 students and approximately 300 teachers per year in 28 local sites across 10 states. About The Algebra Project focuses on the Southern U.S., where the Southern Initiative of the Algebra Project is directed by David J. Dennis, Sr., and on the Young Peoples' Project (YPP), which recruits, trains and deploys high school and college age \\"Math Literacy Workers\\" to work with their younger peers in a variety of math learning opportunities and engage \\"the demand side\\" of mathematics education reform. The YPP is directed by Omowale Moses. Increased student performance in mathematics, as well as greater numbers of students enrolling in college preparatory mathematics classes, is a well documented outcome of the project's work. History The Algebra Project was born out of one parent's concern with the mathematics education of his children in the public schools of Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1982, Bob Moses (who had been providing additional math instruction to his daughter) joined Mary Lou Mehrling, his daughter's eighth grade teacher, to help several students with the study of algebra. Moses, who had taught secondary school mathematics in New York City and Tanzania, decided that an appropriate goal for those students was to have enough skills in algebra to qualify for honors math and science courses in high school. His success in producing the first students from the Open Program of the Martin Luther King School who passed the citywide algebra examination and qualified for ninth grade honors geometry was a testament to his skill as a teacher. It also highlighted a serious problem: Most students in the Open Program were expected not to do well in mathematics. Moses approached the problem at the Open Program in a similar manner to problems he and others had faced in the early sixties in helping the black community of Mississippi seek political power through the vote. While on the surface the problem of the acquisition of political power looked like a simple issue of enticing people to vote, the problem would involve answering an interrelated set of questions. \\"What is the vote for?\\" \\"Why do we want it in the first place?\\" What must we do right now to ensure that when we have the vote, it will work for us to benefit our communities? Answers to these questions eventually resulted in an important context in which to ask people to vote. This context was the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, a community based political party. Similarly, the everyday issues of students failing at mathematics in the Open Program would require a more complex set of issues and community of individuals. Moses, the parent-as-organizer in the program, instinctively applied the lesson he had learned in Mississippi, transforming the everyday issues into a broader political question for the Open Program community to consider: What is algebra for? Why do we want children to study it? What do we need to include in the mathematics education of every middle school student, to provide each of them with access to the college preparatory mathematics curriculum in high school? Why is it important to gain such access? Within these questions, a context for understanding the problems of mathematics education emerged, and a possible solution and effort at community organizing represented by the Algebra Project began to take shape. The answers to the questions, \\"What is algebra for?\\" and \\"Why do we want children to study it?\\", play an important role in the Algebra Project. The project assumes that there is a new standard in assessing mathematics education, a standard of mathematical literacy. In this not so far future, a broad range of mathematical skills will join traditional skills in reading and writing in the definition of literacy. These mathematical skills will not only be important in gaining access to college and math and science related careers, but will also be necessary for full participation in the economic life of this society. In this context, the Algebra Project has as a goal that schools embrace a standard of mathematics education that requires that children be mathematically literate. This will require a community of educators including parents, teachers and school administrators who understand the paramount importance of mathematics education in providing access to the economic life of this society. An answer to the question \\"What do we need to include in the mathematics education of every middle school student?\\" also frames the Algebra Project. =Student strike= From March 1, 2006 to March 4, 2006, Baltimore City Public School System students led by the Baltimore City Algebra Project and coming from high schools across Baltimore City held a three-day student strike to oppose an imminent plan to \\"consolidate\\" many area high schools into fewer buildings. The school system claims these buildings are underutilized, but the students and other advocates counter that the only reason there is extra space in these buildings is because class sizes often are about 40 students per class. Mayor O'Malley listened to the students' demands, apparently out of concern that it could affect his status with the general public in a gubernatorial election year. =The Young People's Project= Founded in 1996, the Young People‚Äôs Project (YPP) is an outgrowth of the Algebra Project. YPP has established sites in Jackson, MS, Chicago, IL, and the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts, and is developing programs in Miami, FL, Petersburg, VA, Los Angeles, CA, Ann Arbor, MI, and Mansfield, OH. Through Math Literacy Worker trainings and development, workshops and community events, YPP promotes math literacy as a tool for young people to demand of themselves, their communities and school systems, an education commensurate with the requirements for citizenship in today‚Äôs technology based economy. Each established site employs from 30 to 100 high school and college age students on a part-time basis, and serves up to 1000 elementary and middle school students through a variety of on and off site programs. As the founding members of YPP have moved from middle to high school to college, their development and the subsequent development of the young people they‚Äôve attracted, has formed the basis for YPP‚Äôs evolution into a truly youth-driven organization. In 2005, the Algebra Project initiated Quality Education as a Civil Right (QECR), a groundbreaking national organizing effort to establish a federal constitutional guarantee to quality public education for all. Throughout 2005, YPP worked with students from Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Oakland, Miami, Jackson, Chicago and Virginia to initiate a dialogue within America about QECR. The Algebra Project and YPP students from Jackson and New Orleans hosted conferences, organized an innovative Spring Break Community Education Tour to Miami and participated in QECR planning meetings at Howard University, the University of Michigan, and Jackson State University.

The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities. Alaska was granted U.S. statehood on January 3, 1959. In 1964, the massive \\"Good Friday earthquake\\" killed 131 people and leveled several villages. The 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline led to an oil boom. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in Prince William Sound, spilling between 11 and 34 million U.S. gallons (42,000 and 130,000 m3) of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,600 km) of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Prehistory of Alaska An Inupiaq woman, Nome, Alaska, c. 1907. Paleolithic families moved into northwestern North America before 10,000 BC across the Bering land bridge in Alaska (see Settlement of the Americas). Alaska became populated by the Inuit and a variety of Native American groups. Today, early Alaskans are divided into several main groups: the Southeastern Coastal Indians (the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian), the Athabascans, the Aleut, and the two groups of Eskimos, the Inupiat and the Yup'ik. The coastal migrants from Asia were probably the first wave of humans to cross the Bering land bridge in western Alaska, and many of them initially settled in the interior of what is now Canada. The Tlingit were the most numerous of this group, claiming most of the coastal Panhandle by the time of European contact and are the northernmost of the group of advanced cultures of the Pacific Northwest Coast renowned for its complex art and political systems and the ceremonial and legal system known as the potlatch. The southern portion of Prince of Wales Island was settled by the Haidas fleeing persecution by other Haidas from the Queen Charlotte Islands (which are now named Haida Gwaii and part of British Columbia). The Aleuts settled the islands of the Aleutian chain approximately 10,000 years ago. Cultural and subsistence practices varied widely among native groups, who were spread across vast geographical distances. 18th century =Early Russian settlement= Alexandr Baranov, \\"Lord of Alaska.\\" On some islands and parts of the Alaskan peninsula, groups of traders had been capable of relatively peaceful coexistence with the local inhabitants. Other groups could not manage the tensions and perpetrated exactions. Hostages were taken, individuals were enslaved, families were split up, and other individuals were forced to leave their villages and settle elsewhere. In addition, eighty percent of the Aleut population was destroyed by Old World diseases, against which they had no immunity, during the first two generations of Russian contact. In 1784, Grigory Ivanovich Shelikhov arrived in Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island, operating the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. Shelikhov and his men killed hundreds of indigenous Koniag, then founded the first permanent Russian settlement in Alaska on the island's Three Saints Bay. By 1788 a number of Russian settlements had been established by Shelikhov and others over a large region, including the mainland areas around Cook Inlet. The Russians had gained control of the habitats of the most valuable sea otters, the Kurilian- Kamchatkan and Aleutian sea otters. Their fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those of sea otters on the Pacific Northwest Coast and California. The Russians, therefore, advanced to the Northwest Coast only after the superior varieties of sea otters were depleted, around 1788. The Russian entry to the Northwest Coast was slow, however, due to a shortage of ships and sailors. Yakutat Bay was reached in 1794 and the settlement of Slavorossiya was built there in 1795. Reconnaissance of the coast as far as the Queen Charlotte Islands was carried out by James Shields, a British employee of the Golikov-Shelikhov Company. In 1795 Alexander Baranov, who had been hired in 1790 to manage Shelikhov's fur enterprise, sailed into Sitka Sound, claiming it for Russia. Hunting parties arrived in the following years and by 1800 three-quarters of Russian America's sea otter skins were coming from the Sitka Sound area. In July 1799 Baranov returned on the brig Oryol and established the settlement of Arkhangelsk. It was destroyed by Tlingits in 1802 but rebuilt nearby in 1804 and given the name Novo-Arkhangelsk (New Archangel). It soon become the primary settlement and colonial capital of Russian America. After the Alaska Purchase, it was renamed Sitka, the first capital of Alaska Territory. Missionary activity St. Michael's Cathedral in Sitka. The original structure, built in 1848, burned in a fire on January 2, 1966. The cathedral was rebuilt from plans of the original structure and contains artifacts rescued from the fire. The Russian Orthodox church (with its rituals and sacred texts, translated into Aleut at a very early stage) had been informally introduced, in the 1740s‚Äì1780s, by the fur traders. During his settlement of Three Saints Bay in 1784, Shelikov introduced the first resident missionaries and clergymen. This missionary activity would continue into the 19th century, ultimately becoming the most visible trace of the Russian colonial period in contemporary Alaska. =Spanish claims= Spanish contact in British Columbia and Alaska. Spanish claims to Alaska dated to the papal bull of 1493, but never involved colonization, forts, or settlements. Instead there were various naval expeditions to explore the region and claim it for Spain. In 1775, Bruno de Hezeta led an expedition; The Sonora, under Bodega y Quadra, ultimately reached latitude 58¬∞ north, entered Sitka Sound and formally claimed the region for Spain. The 1779 expedition of Ignacio de Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra reached Port Etches on Hinchinbrook Island, and entered Prince William Sound. They reached a latitude of 61¬∞ north, the most northern point obtained by Spain. In 1788, Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez and Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro visited Russian settlements at Unalaska. The Nootka Crisis of 1789 almost led to a war between Britain and Spain, when Britain rejected Spanish claims to lands in British Columbia and Spain seized some British ships. The crisis was resolved by the Nootka Convention, which provided that the northwest coast would be open to traders of both Britain and Spain, that the captured British ships would be returned and an indemnity paid. It was a victory for Britain and Spain effectively withdrew from the North Pacific.\\"Nootka Sound Controversy\\" in The Canadian Encyclopedia It transferred its claims in the region to the United States in the Adams-On√≠s Treaty of 1819. Today, Spain's Alaskan legacy endures as little more than a few place names, among these the Malaspina Glacier and the towns of Valdez and Cordova. =Britain's presence= British settlements at the time in Alaska consisted of a few scattered trading outposts, with most settlers arriving by sea. Captain James Cook, midway through his third and final voyage of exploration in 1778, sailed along the west coast of North America aboard HMS Resolution, from then-Spanish California all the way to the Bering Strait. During the trip, he discovered what came to be known as Cook Inlet (named in honor of Cook in 1794 by George Vancouver, who had served under his command) in Alaska. The Bering Strait proved to be impassable, although the Resolution and its companion ship HMS Discovery made several attempts to sail through it. The ships left the straits to return to Hawaii in 1779. Cook's expedition spurred the British to increase their sailings along the northwest coast, following in the wake of the Spanish. Alaska-based posts owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, operated at Fort Yukon, on the Yukon River, Fort Durham (aka Fort Taku) at the mouth of the Taku River, and Fort Stikine, near the mouth of the Stikine River (associated with Wrangell throughout the early 19th century). 19th century =Later Russian settlement and the Russian-American Company (1799‚Äì1867)= 1860 map of Russian America. The Russian-American Company's capital at New Archangel (present-day Sitka, Alaska) in 1837 In 1799, Shelikhov's son-in-law, Nikolay Petrovich Rezanov, acquired a monopoly on the American fur trade from Czar Paul I and formed the Russian-American Company. As part of the deal, the Tsar expected the company to establish new settlements in Alaska and carry out an expanded colonization program. By 1804, Alexander Baranov, now manager of the Russian‚ÄìAmerican Company, had consolidated the company's hold on the American fur trade following his victory over the local Tlingit clan at the Battle of Sitka. Despite these efforts the Russians never fully colonized Alaska. The Russian monopoly on trade was also being weakened by the Hudson's Bay Company, which set up a post on the southern edge of Russian America in 1833. In 1818 management of the Russian-American Company was turned over to the Imperial Russian Navy and the Ukase of 1821 banned foreigners from participating in the Alaskan economy. It soon entered into the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825 which allowed British merchants to trade in Alaska. The Convention also settled most of the border between Alaska and British North America. The Russo-American Treaty of 1824, which banned American merchants above 54¬∞ 40' north latitude, was widely ignored and the Russians' hold on Alaska weakened further. At the height of Russian America, the Russian population reached 700. Although the mid‚Äì19th century were not a good time for Russians in Alaska, conditions improved for the coastal Alaska Natives who had survived contact. The Tlingits were never conquered and continued to wage war on the Russians into the 1850s. The Aleuts, though faced with a decreasing population in the 1840s, ultimately rebounded. =Alaska purchase= The check that paid for Alaska Financial difficulties in Russia, the low profits of trade with Alaskan settlement, and the important desire to keep Alaska out of British hands all contributed to Russia's willingness to sell its possessions in North America. At the instigation of U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, the United States Senate approved the purchase of Alaska from Russia for on August 1, 1867 (equivalent to approximately $M in ). This purchase was popularly known in the U.S. as \\"Seward's Folly\\", \\"Seward's Icebox,\\" or \\"Andrew Johnson's Polar Bear Garden\\", and was unpopular among some people at the time. Later discovery of gold and oil would show it to be a worthwhile one. Scholars debate whether the purchase of Alaska was a financially profitable for the federal Treasury itself, apart from its benefits to Alaskans and to businesses, and to national defense.See unpublished paper =The Department of Alaska (1867‚Äì1884)= The United States flag was raised on October 18, 1867, now called Alaska Day, and the region changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, for residents, Friday, October 6, 1867 was followed by Friday, October 18, 1867‚Äîtwo Fridays in a row because of the 12 day shift in the calendar minus one day for the date-line shift. During the Department era, from 1867 to 1884, Alaska was variously under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army (until 1877), the United States Department of the Treasury from 1877 to 1879, and the U.S. Navy from 1879 to 1884. Civil administration of Alaska began in 1877 under the United States Treasury Department. A Collector of Customs was appointed by the President of the United States. The Collector was the highest-ranking official of the United States government in Alaska and de facto Governor. Henry C, DeAhna, a former Union Army Officer and Mottrom D. Ball, a former Confederate Army officer, were the first individuals to serve as Collector of Customs. When Alaska was first purchased, most of its land remained unexplored. In 1865, Western Union laid a telegraph line across Alaska to the Bering Strait where it would connect, under water, with an Asian line. It also conducted the first scientific studies of the region and produced the first map of the entire Yukon River. The Alaska Commercial Company and the military also contributed to the growing exploration of Alaska in the last decades of the 19th century, building trading posts along the Interior's many rivers. =District of Alaska (1884‚Äì1912)= Miners and prospectors climb the Chilkoot Trail during the Klondike Gold Rush. In 1884, the region was organized and the name was changed from the Department of Alaska to the District of Alaska. At the time, legislators in Washington, D.C., were occupied with post-Civil War reconstruction issues, and had little time to devote to Alaska. In 1896, the discovery of gold in Yukon Territory in neighboring Canada, brought many thousands of miners and new settlers to Alaska, and very quickly ended the nation's four year economic depression. Although it was uncertain whether gold would also be found in Alaska, Alaska greatly profited because it was along the easiest transportation route to the Yukon goldfields. Numerous new cities, such as Skagway, Alaska, owe their existence to a gold rush in Canada. Soapy Smith, a crime boss confidence man who operated the largest criminal empire in gold rush era Alaska, was shot down by vigilantes in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. He is known as \\"Alaska's Outlaw.\\" In 1899, gold was found in Alaska itself in Nome, and several towns subsequently began to be built, such as Fairbanks and Ruby. In 1902, the Alaska Railroad began to be built, which would connect from Seward to Fairbanks by 1914, though Alaska still does not have a railroad connecting it to the lower 48 states today. Still, an overland route was built, cutting transportation times to the contiguous states by days. The industries of copper mining, fishing, and canning began to become popular in the early 20th century, with 10 canneries in some major towns. In 1903, a boundary dispute with Canada was finally resolved. By the turn of the 20th century, commercial fishing was gaining a foothold in the Aleutian Islands. Packing houses salted cod and herring, and salmon canneries were opened. Another commercial occupation, whaling, continued with no regard for over-hunting. They pushed the bowhead whales to the edge of extinction for the oil in their tissue. The Aleuts soon suffered severe problems due to the depletion of fur seals and sea otters which they needed for survival. As well as requiring the flesh for food, they also used the skins to cover their boats, without which they could not hunt. The Americans also expanded into the Interior and Arctic Alaska, exploiting the furbearers, fish, and other game on which Natives depended. 20th century =Alaska Territory (1912‚Äì1959)= When Congress passed the Second Organic Act in 1912, Alaska was reorganized, and renamed the Territory of Alaska. By 1916, its population was about 58,000. James Wickersham, a Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska's first statehood bill, but it failed due to the small population and lack of interest from Alaskans. Even President Warren G. Harding's visit in 1923 could not create widespread interest in statehood. Under the conditions of the Second Organic Act, Alaska had been split into four divisions. The most populous of the divisions, whose capital was Juneau, wondered if it could become a separate state from the other three. Government control was a primary concern, with the territory having 52 federal agencies governing it. Then, in 1920, the Jones Act required U.S.-flagged vessels to be built in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and documented under the laws of the United States. All goods entering or leaving Alaska had to be transported by American carriers and shipped to Seattle prior to further shipment, making Alaska dependent on Washington. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Constitution saying one state should not hold sway over another's commerce did not apply because Alaska was only a territory. The prices Seattle shipping businesses charged began to rise to take advantage of the situation. This situation created an atmosphere of enmity among Alaskans who watched the wealth being generated by their labors flowing into the hands of Seattle business holdings. In July 1923 Warren Harding became the first sitting President to visit Alaska as part of his Pacific Northwest 'Voyage of Understanding.\\" Harding arrived by boat from Seattle and made nine stops in the Territory via train which went from Seward to Fairbanks. On July 15 Harding drove in a golden railroad spike at Nenana. The train car in which he rode now sits in Fairbanks' Pioneer Park.Eilperin, Juliet. The fascinating (and scenic) history of presidential visits to Alaska. The Washington Post, August 25, 2015. Retrieved June 14, 2017. The Depression caused prices of fish and copper, which were vital to Alaska's economy at the time, to decline. Wages were dropped and the workforce decreased by more than half. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt thought Americans from agricultural areas could be transferred to Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley for a fresh chance at agricultural self-sustainment. Colonists were largely from northern states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota under the belief that only those who grew up with climates similar to that of Alaska's could handle settler life there. The United Congo Improvement Association asked the president to settle 400 African-American farmers in Alaska, saying that the territory would offer full political rights, but racial prejudice and the belief that only those from northern states would make suitable colonists caused the proposal to fail. The exploration and settlement of Alaska would not have been possible without the development of the aircraft, which allowed for the influx of settlers into the state's interior, and rapid transportation of people and supplies throughout. However, due to the unfavorable weather conditions of the state, and high ratio of pilots-to-population, over 1700 aircraft wreck sites are scattered throughout its domain. Numerous wrecks also trace their origins to the military build-up of the state during both World War II and the Cold War. *See also History of aviation in Alaska World War II Propaganda poster, World War II, depicting Alaska as a death trap for Japan. first Japanese attack on Dutch Harbor, June 3, 1942. During World War II, two of the outer Aleutian Islands‚ÄîAttu and Kiska‚Äîwere invaded and occupied by Japanese troops. They were the only parts of the continental United States to be invaded and occupied by an enemy nation during the war. Their recovery became a matter of national pride. On June 3, 1942, the Japanese launched an air attack on Dutch Harbor, a U.S. naval base on Unalaska Island, but were repelled by U.S. forces. A few days later, the Japanese landed on the islands of Kiska and Attu, where they overwhelmed Attu villagers. The villagers were taken to Japan, where they were interned for the remainder of the war. Aleuts from the Pribilofs and Aleutian villages were evacuated by the United States to Southeast Alaska. Many suffered during their two years internment there, and the federal government, charged with their care, provided inadequate health care, food, and shelter. Attu was regained in May 1943 after two weeks of intense fighting and 3,929 American casualties: 549 killed, 1148 injured and 1200 severe cold injuries, 614 to disease and 318 dead of miscellaneous causes, The U.S. then turned its attention to the other occupied island, Kiska. From June through August, a multitude of bombs were dropped on the tiny island, though the Japanese ultimately escaped via transport ships. After the war, the Native Attuans who had survived their internment were resettled to Atka by the federal government, which considered their home villages too remote to defend. In 1942, the Alaska‚ÄìCanada Military Highway was completed, in part to form an overland supply route to the Soviet Union on the other side of the Bering Strait. Running from Great Falls, Montana, to Fairbanks, the road was the first stable link between Alaska and the rest of America. The construction of military bases, such as the Adak base, contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities. Anchorage almost doubled in size, from 4,200 people in 1940 to 8,000 in 1945. =Statehood= By the turn of the 20th century, a movement pushing for Alaska statehood began, but in the contiguous 48 states, legislators were worried that Alaska's population was too sparse, distant, and isolated, and its economy was too unstable for it to be a worthwhile addition to the United States.Littke, Peter. (2003). Russian-American Bibliography () World War II and the Japanese invasion highlighted Alaska's strategic importance, and the issue of statehood was taken more seriously, but it was the discovery of oil at Swanson River on the Kenai Peninsula that dispelled the image of Alaska as a weak, dependent region. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Alaska Statehood Act into United States law on July 4, 1958, which paved the way for Alaska's admission into the Union on January 3, 1959. Juneau, the territorial capital, continued as state capital, and William A. Egan was sworn in as the first governor. Alaska does not have counties, unlike every other American state except Louisiana. (Louisiana has parishes). Instead, it is divided into 16 boroughs and one \\"unorganized borough\\" made up of all land not within any borough. Boroughs have organized area-wide governments, but within the unorganized borough, where there is no such government, services are provided by the state. The unorganized borough is divided into artificially-created census areas by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. Earthquake damage in Anchorage On March 27, 1964 the Good Friday earthquake struck South-central Alaska, churning the earth for four minutes with a magnitude of 9.2. The earthquake was one of the most powerful ever recorded and killed 139 people. Most of them were drowned by the tsunamis that tore apart the towns of Valdez and Chenega. Throughout the Prince William Sound region, towns and ports were destroyed and land was uplifted or shoved downward. The uplift destroyed salmon streams, as the fish could no longer jump the various newly created barriers to reach their spawning grounds. Ports at Valdez and Cordova were beyond repair, and the fires destroyed what the mudslides had not. At Valdez, an Alaska Steamship Company ship was lifted by a huge wave over the docks and out to sea, but most hands survived. At Turnagain Arm, off Cook Inlet, the incoming water destroyed trees and caused cabins to sink into the mud. On Kodiak, a tsunami wiped out the villages of Afognak, Old Harbor, and Kaguyak and damaged other communities, while Seward lost its harbor. Despite the extent of the catastrophe, Alaskans rebuilt many of the communities. =North to the Future= \\"North to the Future\\" is the official state motto of Alaska, adopted in 1967 for the centennial of the Alaska Purchase. As one of the events leading up to the celebration, the Alaska Centennial Commission sponsored a contest in 1963 to come up with a centennial motto and emblem that would express the unique character of the State of Alaska. They offered a $300.00 (which is about $2000 in 2010 dollars) prize to the winning entry. 761 entries were received by the Commission. In December 1963, the commission announced that they had selected Juneau journalist Richard Peter's suggestion. He stated that the motto \\"...is a reminder that beyond the horizon of urban clutter there is a Great Land beneath our flag that can provide a new tomorrow for this century's 'huddled masses yearning to be free'.\\" The motto represents a visionary optimism for a state filled with promise; promoting the State of Alaska by advising that the future lies with the next-to-the-last United States star located to the north of the Lower 48. =1968 ‚Äì present: oil and land politics= Oil discovery, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act(ANCSA), and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline The 1968 discovery of oil on the North Slope's Prudhoe Bay‚Äîwhich would turn out to have the most recoverable oil of any field in the United States‚Äîwould change Alaska's political landscape for decades. This discovery catapulted the issue of Native land ownership into the headlines. In the mid-1960s, Alaska Natives from many tribal groups had united in an effort to gain title to lands wrested from them by Europeans, but the government had responded slowly before the Prudhoe Bay discovery. The government finally took action when permitting for a pipeline crossing the state, necessary to get Alaskan oil to market, was stalled pending the settlement of Native land claims. In 1971, with major petroleum dollars on the line, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was signed into law by Richard Nixon. Under the Act, Natives relinquished aboriginal claims to their lands in exchange for access to 44 million acres (180,000 km¬≤) of land and payment of $963 million. The settlement was divided among regional, urban, and village corporations, which managed their funds with varying degrees of success. Map of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Though a pipeline from the North Slope to the nearest ice-free port, almost 800 miles (1,300 km) to the south, was the only way to get Alaska's oil to market, significant engineering challenges lay ahead. Between the North Slope and Valdez, there were active fault lines, three mountain ranges, miles of unstable, boggy ground underlain with frost, and migration paths of caribou and moose. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was ultimately completed in 1977 at a total cost of $8 billion. The pipeline allowed an oil bonanza to take shape. Per capita incomes rose throughout the state, with virtually every community benefiting. State leaders were determined that this boom would not end like the fur and gold booms, in an economic bust as soon as the resource had disappeared. In 1976, the state's constitution was amended to establish the Alaska Permanent Fund, in which a quarter of all mineral lease proceeds is invested. Income from the fund is used to pay annual dividends to all residents who qualify, to increase the fund's principal as a hedge against inflation, and to provide funds for the state legislature. Since 1993, the fund has produced more money than the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, whose production is diminishing. , the fund's value was over $30 billion. Environmentalism, the Exxon Valdez, and ANWR Oil production was not the only economic value of Alaska's land, however. In the second half of the 20th century, Alaska discovered tourism as an important source of revenue. Tourism became popular after World War II, when military personnel stationed in the region returned home praising its natural splendor. The Alcan Highway, built during the war, and the Alaska Marine Highway System, completed in 1963, made the state more accessible than before. Tourism became increasingly important in Alaska, and today over 1.4 million people visit the state each year. With tourism more vital to the economy, environmentalism also rose in importance. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 added 53.7 million acres (217,000 km¬≤) to the National Wildlife Refuge system, parts of 25 rivers to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, 3.3 million acres (13,000 km¬≤) to National Forest lands, and 43.6 million acres (176,000 km¬≤) to National Park land. Because of the Act, Alaska now contains two-thirds of all American national parklands. Today, more than half of Alaskan land is owned by the Federal Government. Oil pooled on rocks on the shore of Prince William Sound after the oil spill. The possible environmental repercussions of oil production became clear in the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. On March 24, the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, releasing 11 million gallons of crude oil into the water, spreading along 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of shoreline. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at least 300,000 sea birds, 2,000 otters, and other marine animals died because of the spill. Exxon spent US$2 billion on cleaning up in the first year alone. Exxon, working with state and federal agencies, continued its cleanup into the early 1990s. Government studies show that the oil and the cleaning process itself did long-term harm to the ecology of the Sound, interfering with the reproduction of birds and animals in ways that still aren't fully understood. Prince William Sound seems to have recuperated, but scientists still dispute the extent of the recovery. In a civil settlement, Exxon agreed to pay $900 million in ten annual payments, plus an additional $100 million for newly discovered damages. In a class action suit against Exxon, a jury awarded punitive damages of US$5 billion, but as of 2008 no money has been disbursed and appellate litigation continues. Today, the tension between preservation and development is seen in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) drilling controversy. The question of whether to allow drilling for oil in ANWR has been a political football for every sitting American president since Jimmy Carter. Studies performed by the US Geological Survey have shown that the \\"1002 area\\" of ANWR, located just east of Prudhoe Bay, contains large deposits of crude oil.Elizabeth Sands & Stephanie Pahler.Geology. Columbia University. Retrieved on 2007-04-08 Kenneth J. Bird and David W. Houseknecht. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 1002 Area, Petroleum Assessment, 1998, Including Economic Analysis.

Retrieved on 2007-04-08 Traditionally, Alaskan residents, trade unions, and business interests have supported drilling in the refuge, while environmental groups and many within the Democratic Party have traditionally opposed it. Among native Alaskan tribes, support is mixed. In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, votes about the status of the refuge occurred repeatedly in the U.S. House and Senate, but as of 2007 efforts to allow drilling have always been ultimately thwarted by filibusters, amendments, or vetoes.

It is designed primarily for anti-tank warfare missions but has secondary air-to-air combat capability as well. Initiated by chief designer Wu Ximing, the project had early Russian involvement with Kamov Design Bureau of Russia under a contract with the Chinese government, but the collaboration was abruptly stopped due to fundamental design philosophy disagreements. The Chinese designers and their customer, the PLA General Armaments Department, preferred an lighter-weight, more agile airframe with less emphasis on armor. The helicopter was further developed by Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation (CAIC) and locally manufactured. Nicknames of characters in the Chinese classic novel Water Margin have been used to name Z-10 and its light-weight counterpart Harbin Z-19: Z-10 is called Fierce Thunderbolt (Pi Li Huo, ÈúπÈõ≥ÁÅ´), the nickname of Qin Ming, while Z-19 is called Black Whirlwind (Hei Xuan Feng, ÈªëÊóãÈ£é), the nickname of Li Kui. In September 2016, the PLA announced that all of its army aviation units had been equipped with the WZ-10.WZ-10 attack helicopter now deployed in all PLA aviation units - Airrecognition.com, 8 September 2016 Development =Early exploration= In 1979, the Chinese military studied the problem of countering large armour formations. It concluded that the best conventional solution was to use attack helicopters. Eight A√©rospatiale Gazelle armed with Euromissile HOT were procured for evaluation. By the mid-1980s, the Chinese decided a dedicated attack helicopter was required. At the time, they used civilian helicopters converted for the military; these were no longer adequate in the attack role, and suitable only as scouts. Following this, China evaluated the Agusta A129 Mangusta, and in 1988 secured an agreement with the United States to purchase AH-1 Cobras and a license to produce BGM-71 TOW missiles; the latter was cancelled following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the resulting arms embargo. The colour revolutions prevented the purchase of attack helicopters from Eastern Europe in 1990 and 1991; Bulgaria and Russia rejected Chinese offers to purchase the Mil Mi-24. While attempting to import foreign designs failed, war games determined that attack helicopters had to be commanded by the army, rather than the air force. This led to the formation of the People's Liberation Army Ground Force Air Force (PLAGFAF), with an initial strength of 9 Harbin Z-9. The PLAGFAF conducted tactical experiments that would help define the future Z-10's requirements. Research also decided that anti-tank missiles like the BGM-71 TOW were inadequate, and favoured an analogue to the AGM-114 Hellfire. These findings ensured the Z-10 would be based around the new missile. =Medium helicopter program= The Gulf War highlighted the urgent need for attack helicopters, and revalidated the assessment that a purpose-built design was needed. (At the time, the Chinese military depended on armed utility helicopters such as the Changhe Z-11 and Harbin Z-9.) Also, it demonstrated that the new attack helicopter would need to be able to defend itself against other helicopters and aircraft. The military perceived that once the new attack helicopter entered service, the existing helicopters would be used as scouts. The Armed Helicopter Developmental Work Team (Ê≠¶Ë£ÖÁõ¥ÂçáÊú∫ÂºÄÂèëÂ∑•‰ΩúÂ∞èÁªÑ) was formed to develop a new medium helicopter design, as opposed to basing the new design on the light helicopters then in service. The 602nd and 608th Research Institutes started development of the 6-ton class China Medium Helicopter (CHM) programHewson, Robert, \\"China‚Äôs Z-10 helicopter built on Western expertise\\", Jane‚Äôs Defence Weekly, 13 April 2005 in 1994. A secret contract was signed with the Kamov design bureau of Russia to design and verify the helicopter airframe and propulsion. The program was promoted as a civilian project, and was able to secure significant Western technical assistance, such as from Eurocopter (rotor installation design consultancy), Pratt & Whitney Canada (PT6C turboshaft engine) and Agusta Westland (transmission). The Chinese concentrated on areas where it could not obtain foreign help. =Attack helicopter program= Pratt & Whitney alongside Hamilton Sundstrand divisions of the United Technology Company unlawfully transported and provided US military technology into this program. In effort to maintain profits they conspired to cover up these facts. They were found guilty of these charges in June 2012. Several of the charges were deferred adjudications. In 1998, the 602nd Research Institute proposed to either separate the armed helicopter program from the medium helicopter program, or devote all resources to the armed helicopter program. The 602nd Research Institute's called its proposed armed helicopter design the WZ-10 (Wu Zhi (Ê≠¶Áõ¥)-10), with some sources outside of China calling it the Z-X armed helicopter. As a result, most of the resource went to the Z-10, although the medium helicopter program continued with reduced priority; the medium helicopter could continue to develop technology used by both military and civilian aircraft. The Z-10 program was called the Special Armed Project (‰∏ìÊ≠¶Â∑•Á®ã), a short form for Special Use Armed Helicopter Project (‰∏ìÁî®Ê≠¶Ë£ÖÁõ¥ÂçáÊú∫Â∑•Á®ã). Development was kept under stricter secrecy than the Chengdu J-10 fighter. Nearly ¬• 4 billion was initially invested and the WZ-1- became one of the most important programs begun in the 9th 5-yr plan. Publicly the 602nd Research Institute was assigned as the chief designer to promote the illusion of it being a domestically developed attack helicopter, while Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (HAMC) of China Aviation Industry Corporation II (AVIC II) was assigned as the primary manufacturer. Nearly four dozen other establishments participated in the program. In the summer of 1999, AVIC II began to use a CAMC Z-8 to test newly developed Z-10 sub-systems. In autumn of the same year, a Harbin Z-9 was added to the test aircraft inventory. These tests concentrated on sub-systems such as the fire-control systems, HOTAS controls and navigation systems. South Africa provided limited help in the area of flight stability based on experience from designing the Denel Rooivalk. South African assistance ceased in 2001. =New manufacturer= In 2000, the Chinese again attempted to obtain a Russian attack helicopter, but the deal for the Kamov Ka-50 fell apart just as the Mil Mi-28 deal several years earlier. The repeated failures in obtaining foreign attack helicopters reinforced feelings that China had no choice but to ignore foreign options and develop its own such aircraft and work on the Z-10 accelerated. In the same year, HAMC transferred most of its production responsibilities to CAIC of AVIC II. The official reason given was excessive workload; HAMC was busy producing the HC120 and Harbin Z-9, as well as other fixed-wing aircraft such as the Harbin Y-12, and thus was stretched to the limit. However, many speculated that HAMC was not performing well enough due to rigid and ineffective Soviet-style management practices, believed to have caused the company to go into debt. Although HAMC was in the process of reform, which finally succeeded, the government and military were weary and impatient. The SH-5 factory had become very profitable after its successful restructuring and reform, but it had to get out of the aircraft manufacturing business for good, manufacturing pressurized tanks and other specialized containers. It was decided that the Z-10 program was too important to be run by HAMC, so a more stable contractor was sought and CAIC was selected. HAMC still retained responsibility for production of certain sub- systems and components, for which it could utilize experience gained from manufacturing parts for foreign helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft such as the Embraer ERJ 145 family. In May 2002, the Z-10 tail rotor and some other components were tested on the ground by the 602nd Research Institute. In April 2003, a Z-10 prototype completed its maiden flight at Lumeng (ÂêïËíô) airfield, the airfield having been assigned to CAIC for such use. According to Chinese sources, the initial test flights were concluded on December 17, 2003, whereas according to other sources they were completed nine months earlier in March 2003. According to Jane's Information Group, a total of 3 prototypes had completed over 400 hours of test flights by this time. By 2004 3 more prototypes were built, for a total of 6, and a second stage of test flights were concluded on December 15, 2004. In one of the test flights the future commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army Ground Force Air Force (PLAGAF), Song Xiangsheng (ÂÆãÊπòÁîü), was on board the prototype. A third stage of intensive test flights followed, taking place during both day and night. By January 2006 weaponry and sensor tests, including firing of live ammunition, were taking place. Prototypes and a small number of pre-production aircraft are in service with the Chinese military for evaluation. The design is undergoing continuous minor modification and upgrade based on the feedback. =Amphibious role= In March 2014, the PLA released pictures of a Z-10 helicopter conducting deck trials with a People's Liberation Army Navy Type 072A-class landing ship. The purpose may be to qualify the helicopter on ships to provide air support for landing parties launched from the ship. Type 072A-class ships have a helipad but no hangar or support facilities for the aircraft on board. The Z-10 may also be qualified on the larger Type 071 amphibious transport dock.Chinese Army Z-10 Attack Helicopter conducts trials at sea with Navy Type 072A Landing Ship - Navyrecognition.com, 23 March 2014 Design CAIC WZ-10 The Kamov design bureau was contracted to perform the development work under a secret contract. Kamov worked with the Chinese to establish base specifications, such as weight, speed and payload capacity after which they had full freedom to design the helicopter. Kamov designed, tested and verified the helicopter design, after which it was provided to the Chinese team. Although designed in Russia, the prototype construction, flight testing and further development was performed by the Chinese. Wu Ximing (Âê¥Â∏åÊòé) of the 602nd Research Institute, one of the Chinese top scientists involved in the 863 Program was publicly credited with being the chief designer of the Z-10, in an attempt to preserve the secrecy of the Kamov contract. Wu had earlier participated in the designs of the armed version of transport helicopters Z-8A and WZ-9. In order to complete the necessary development, the 602nd Research Institute and CAIC had jointly built a new engineering design center, industrial simulator, aircraft engine ground test center, fatigue laboratory, and rotary test platform (nicknamed as Iron Bird Platform, ÈìÅÈ∏üÂè∞). In the end of 2001, the final test was completed on the full-scale rotary test platform, paving the way for test flights. Composite material is widely used in the Z-10 but China faced difficulties in this field, particularly in the area of survivability during crashes. Huge efforts were spent to domestically develop composite materials able to provide comparable levels of survivability to Western counterparts. This achievement earned a second place in the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND) progress reward. =Avionics (aircraft related)= The main contractor of the avionics of Z-10 is the 613th Research Institute, which was responsible for integrating all of the avionics subsystems provided by subcontractors. Although foreign technologies are utilized (particularly French and Israeli, as rumored), this is limited to hardware only. All software applicable to Z-10 are completely indigenously developed by China on its own. Reportedly, the most time-consuming part of the software engineering for Z-10 was to develop all of the mathematic models needed for Z-10. Instead of using French standard DIGIBUS, Z-10 is built to Chinese GJV289A standard, the Chinese equivalent of MIL-STD-1553B. The adaptation of western military standard means that western weaponry can be readily deployed on Z-10, and the developer claims that all it needed was to add a module or interface to accomplish this. The ease of being compatible with multiple weaponry would also help to expand the export market of Z-10 in the future. Flight instrumentation There are two configurations of the flight instrumentation for Z-10, one developed from similar foreign system (rumored to be French), and the other one is indigenously developed, and both configurations share the same holographic head-up display. The difference in layout between the two configurations is that in one configuration, there are three color LCD multi-function displays (MFD), while in the other, these are replaced by two larger LCD MFDs. It's not clear which one is originated from foreign system and which is indigenously developed, but it's reported that the practice of having different configurations thanks to the modular design is for export purposes, to fit the potential customer countries‚Äô pilots‚Äô habits. However, in early 2018, it is revealed that the 2-piece MFD version is the one selected to enter service. Z-10 is also the very first Chinese helicopter that adopts HOTAS, but a traditional conventional control system had been developed in parallel as a backup, just as the case of cockpit MFDs, and for exactly the same reason why two configurations of flight instrumentation were developed in parallel. The erroneous claim of installing Russian K-36/37 ejection seat in the cockpit of Z-10 proved to be false, and the survival of pilots in emergency landings depends on the crash worthiness of the helicopter. To counterbalance the weight of the armor protecting the pilots, flight instrumentation panel is the place where composite material is mostly used, as in the case of the dashboard of automobiles, where plastic material concentrates. One of the greatest challenges was to find the right composite material that is fit to use, while at the same time, also meets the safety standard so that during a fire, the pilots would not be knocked out by the toxic fume released by the burning composite material. Navigation Unlike previous Chinese helicopters, in which the different navigational systems on board were used independently, the navigational systems of Z-10 are fully integrated, and these include a Ring laser gyroscope, which will be replaced in the future by a Fibre optic gyroscope currently under development, once it becomes available. A radar altimeter currently installed on Z-10 is fully interchangeable with the laser altimeter. Early units of Z-10 have a pulse Doppler navigational radar which only had weather and navigational capabilities, and a more advanced (and thus more costly) model has been developed, incorporating ground mapping, terrain- avoidance, and terrain-following radar capabilities. The on-board inertial navigation system (INS) is fully integrated with the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and provisions are made for future upgrades to include Galileo (satellite navigation)/GPS/GLONASS when expanded capabilities of these systems become available. For potential export customers, it can select the satellite navigation systems of its choice, though GPS is usually the norm. In addition, despite the developer's claim that the navigational system of Z-10 can utilize a variety of satellite navigation to improve its accuracy, the integrated GPS corrected INS is the only system that has been shown to the public at Zhuhai Airshows and other defense exhibitions. A modified Blue Sky navigation pod can also be carried by Z-10. Information is shared via a secured data-link that provides real time and near-real time information. =Avionics (mission related)= Z-10 at Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution Electronic warfare The electronic warfare (EW) system of Z-10 is the first Chinese EW system that integrates the radar, radar warning receivers (RWR), laser warning receivers (LWR), electronic support measures (ESM) and electronic counter-measures (ECM) together. The system is designated YH-96 (YH = Yu Huo, Êµ¥ÁÅ´), named after the YH radar. YH-96 is claimed to have a high interception rate of hostile signals, and in the fully automatic mode, it can automatically analyze the threat and launch different decoys and jamming signals accordingly. Alternatively, pilots can choose to launch decoys or jamming enemy sensors themselves. The helicopter also has an infrared jammer. Like the modified Blue Sky navigation pod, a modified BM/KG300G self-protection jamming pod can also be carried, usually on one of the hard points of the stub wings. Similarly, a modified KZ900 reconnaissance pod can be carried for reconnaissance missions, although all of these additions come at the cost of reducing the number of hardpoints available for carrying weaponry. Usually, only one such pod is carried at any one time. The identification friend or foe (IFF) system of Z-10 is specially designed to work in an environment of heavy enemy jamming. All internally mounted jamming and decoy launching systems are built with the concept of modular design, so that they can be readily replaced when newer technologies become available. Electro-optics One of the two primary fire control systems (FCS) is the electro-optical (optronics) system, which utilizes experience gained from earlier manufacturing of similar French and Israeli systems, combining the best of two, but only hardware wise. The software is completely indigenously developed by China. The optronics FCS is manufactured by the 218th Factory of China North Industries Group Corp, later reformed as China North Industries Group Corporation Electro-Opticals Science & Technology Ltd. (‰∏≠ÂÖµÂÖâÁîµÁßëÊäÄËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏.) The chief designer was Dr. Li Baoping (Êùé‰øùÂπ≥), deputy bureau chief of the Electro-Optical Bureau of the China North Industries Group Corp and the project manager of the Z-10's optronics FCS, known as the Airborne Stabilized Aiming System (Êú∫ËΩΩÁ®≥ÁûÑÁ≥ªÁªü). The same firm also developed the primary weapon of Z-10, the HJ-10 anti-tank missile. There are a total of four known types of optronics FCS that have been publicized, and all of them share similar components for most parts. The common components of all three types include color daytime TV camera, night vision camera, imaging infrared camera. The earliest sample is the cheapest, with a laser range finder for HJ-8 and similar wire-guided missiles. A more advanced version appeared shortly after, with a laser range finding and targeting system for laser beam riding missiles such as HJ-9. The latest version currently in service has a laser ranger / designator for semi-active laser guided missiles such as HJ-9A and HJ-10. The most recent system that is currently under development incorporates a laser ranging / targeting system that can perform all of the functions previously handled by separate system, and this latest developmental type is also the most expensive and bulkiest one of all. During the 10th 5-yr plan, the 602nd Research Institute was tasked to develop a mast-mounting system for the optronics FCS, which was successfully completed in 2003 (test flew on Harbin Z-9). The optronics FCS is fully compatible and can be slaved to the pilots‚Äô HMS/HMD, and the seekers of the missiles can also be slaved to the FCS. Helmet mounted targeting and night vision In addition to the millimeter wave fire control radar and optronic FCS, the pilot of Z-10 has another FCS, the helmet mounted sight (HMS) designed by the 613th Research Institute. The HMS is standard for Z-10. The HMS is based on the earlier HMS used on WZ-9, which was first shown at the 5th Zhuhai Airshow held in 2004. At the 7th Zhuhai Airshow held in 2008, the developer confirmed that the HMS is fully integrated into the FCS and the onboard navigational systems. Navigational information can be displayed on the MFD, pilots can also fly Z-10 in a 'hands-on' manner, including at night using HMS-compatible night vision goggles (NVG) similar to the French TopOwl HMS used on Eurocopter Tiger. The Chinese HMS can control both the air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, other unguided weapons, as well as providing navigational info. Additionally, helmet mounted displays (HMDs) were developed for Z-10, similar to the Honeywell M142 Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS) used on AH-64 Apache. The developer confirmed that HMD is not standard as it is incompatible with the NVGs, the two cannot be simultaneously equipped. It is unclear whether NVG is standard; however the developer has claimed that the helmet and HMS are fully compatible with NVGs. Images released by official government sources have shown that the Z-10 uses binocular-form NVGs (as well as other helicopters in Chinese service). As with the case of optronic FCS, reportedly, NVGs of Z-10 is developed based on experience gained in manufacturing similar French and Israeli systems. In late 2018, the 2nd generation Chinese HMS designed for Z-10 has been revealed, where a large single eye piece has replaced the two-piece binocular ones in the 1st generation HMS. Radar Despite the original plan, the millimeter wave (MMW) fire-control radar (FCR) is not standard for Z-10, because the radar was not ready in time. The urgent need forced the early samples of Z-10 to be evaluated without the planned radar, and it was only later that the radar became available. The MMW FCR for Z-10 is developed by China Northern Electronic Co. (‰∏≠ÂõΩÂåóÊñπÁîµÂ≠êÂÖ¨Âè∏), a subsidiary of Norinco. This MMW FCR is fully solid state and fully digitized, weighing 69.5 kg, less than half of similar former Soviet system. In comparison, both the Russian Arabelet / FH-101 MMW FCR used on Kamov Ka-50N and the Ukrainian Khinzhal MMW FCR used on Mil Mi-28N weight around 150 kg. In contrast to the Russian system that uses two antennas, the Chinese MMW FCR adopts western approach of using a single antenna, similar to AN/APG-78 used for AH-64D Apache Longbow. The radar is designated as YH, short for Yu Huo (Êµ¥ÁÅ´), meaning bathing in fire. YH MMW FCR is fully integrated with other subsystems of the onboard electronic warfare system, such as radar warning receivers (RWR), laser warning receivers (LWR), electronic support measures (ESM), and electronic countermeasures (ECM), the entire EW system is named after the radar. =Cockpit= The stepped tandem cockpit houses two aviators ‚Äì the gunner in the back and the pilot in the front ‚Äì different from the conventional layout of most attack helicopters, confirmed by Chinese official news agency's video report.\\"WZ-10 helicopter training video report, details revealed.\\" CNTV, 10 Feb 2013. The flight control of both aviators serves to back each other up, and the pilot, who is also the team leader of the aircrew, may override the gunner's commands. The bottom and sides of the cockpit are protected by composite armor, and so are the engines and the fuel tank located in the middle of the fuselage. The canopy of the cockpit is specially treated to prevent glare from the sun, and, as an additional option, a tanned version is also available for camouflage purposes, though this is not standard. The bullet-proof glass of the canopy may be as thick as 38 millimeters, and is able to withstand direct hits from shrapnel and rounds fired from machine guns up to .50 caliber size. Additional armor plate can be fitted for improved protection. =Propulsion= CAIC WZ-10 Powerplant and auxiliary power unit The operation engine for the Z-10 is the domestic WZ-9 (WZ = Wo Zhou, Ê∂°ËΩ¥), designed by the 602nd Research Institute. The previous claim of WZ-9 being a Chinese version of MTR390 proved to be false, because according to the publicized official Chinese governmental technical documents, VK-2500, TV3-117 and PT6 are all classified as third generation turboshaft engines, a category Wozhou-9 belongs to, while MTR390 is classified as a fourth generation turboshaft engine. Wozhou-9 is the second least powerful engine out of the five tested for Z-10, but enjoys the advantage of no foreign built components. Furthermore, since it is 100% built in China, there are no political issues that would affect the purchase of vital parts. Wozhou (WZ)-9 is in full production to power the Z-10. Specifications for Wo Zhou ‚Äì 9 (Ê∂°ËΩ¥-9) turboshaft engine which installed in Z-10 for mass production : *Power: 1000 kW *Fuel consumption: 0.311 kg/(kW¬∑h) *Pressure ratio: > 8 *Inlet temperature: 1355 degrees Celsius *Power-to-weight ratio: 5.4 Another new engine, developed by China and Turbomeca, is the WZ16 (Ê∂°ËΩ¥16).https://www.safran-helicopter- engines.com/engine-partnerships/partnerships/wz16/wz16 Its maximum output power is 1500 kW, and it will be installed in the Z-10 and Z-15 /EC175. After the installation of the new engines power would increase by 500 kW for Z-10. With WZ-9 turboshafts, Z-10 can carry 16 HJ-10 missiles with maximum takeoff weight, but the payload is very heavy for the Z-10 and engines and potentially risky for flying, so 8 missiles with other weapons serve as the maximum useful payload. After new WZ16 engines are installed in the Z-10, it can carry 16 of them like AH-64. The auxiliary power unit (APU) of Z-10 is centered on a new brushless DC electric motor designed by Huafeng Avionics (ÂçéÁÉΩËà™Á©∫ÁîµÂô®) Co, a subsidiary of GAIC. The motor is characterized by its low voltage, high power, high rpm, and stable current; the entire development only took three months. In contrast to previous helicopter designs, the integrated APU also provides power to onboard avionics for Z-10, where early designs had separate systems for starting the main engine and powering onboard avionics. Such system has never been used on Chinese helicopters before, and its adaptation on Z-10 proved to be successful. Z-10 is not stealthy, but careful attentions have been given to reduce its electro-magnetic characteristics to reduce the probability of being detected. The planned procedure to reduce its radar cross section includes adopting radar absorbent paints. Another planned measure is to incorporate laser altimeter pioneered by Israel, which would reduce the probability of intercept by enemy's electronic support measures in comparison to traditional radar altimeter, which emits radio/radar signals, while laser is far less prone to interception. Chinese have claimed that the avionics of Z-10 is more advanced than that of Russian attack helicopters, and the avionics suite enables Z-10 to be able to conduct missions at a level that is just 10 meters above the ground. Rotors The main rotor is mounted in the midsection of the fuselage, consisting of a total of five blades. From 1994 through 2001, the deputy chief engineer of CAIC, Mr. Li Meng (ÊùéËêå) led the team to successfully develop the main rotor for Z-10, winning two patents in the process. The main rotor blade, Type 95KT composite rotor blade was a top priority of the 8th 5-yr plan that first began in that era, and it was one of the ten critical technologies of Z-10. China never had such advanced technology and Mr. Li Meng had to lead his team to develop it on their own, and finished the job ahead of schedule. The early successful completion not only enabled Z-10 to fly a full year ahead of the schedule, but Type 95KT blades have also been widely used afterward in new helicopters and upgrading old helicopters. Spheriflex Rotor Head is the type which Z-10 used with flaw damage tolerant design, lowest vibration level in its class even at high speed, easy maintenance, excellent manoeuvrability and stability. Type 95KT foamed composite blade requires many new manufacturing techniques that previously did not exist in China, including: the soaking of the prefabricated material in special solutions under medium temperature, foaming of the carbon fiber and glass fiber composite material, solidification process of the foaming material, adding composite skin layers, and mathematical models for predicting the thermal expansion of the molds used for composite materials. Mr. Li Meng and his team made breakthroughs in all of these areas and with the new techniques they developed, the production was greatly improved, with the energy cost reduced by 90%, production cycles shortened by more than five sixths, and molds needed reduced by five sixths also. China has claimed that these breakthroughs enabled Chinese productivity to reach its western counterparts. In addition to the composite material, there are four titanium alloy layers on the leading edge of every blade. Z-10's successful main rotor and blades will be also installed on the EC175 / Z-15, so like the UH-1Y and AH-1Z, EC175 and Z-10 share the similar engines, same rotors and blades, one for transport another for combat. This will rebuild the whole structure of the PLA Army Aviation. Based on the success of Harbin Z-9 and HC120, fenestron configuration was originally adopted for the tail rotor. However, due to the inherent disadvantages of the design, such as higher power requirement, higher construction and maintenance cost, higher resistance and weight, fenestron design was dropped after test flights, and a more conventional tail rotor configuration was adopted. The 4-blade tail rotor is similar to the tail rotor of AH-64, with two pairs at unequal distance instead of 4 blades at the equal distance, and one of the main purposes of such arrangement was to reduce noise. The tail rotor blades consist of a total of 11 layers of glass- reinforced plastic and composite material, enabling them to sustain direct bullet hits. =Weaponry= Due to its modular design concept, Z-10 can be armed with a wide variety of weaponry. The adaptation of Chinese GJV289A standard, the Chinese equivalent of the MIL-STD-1553B databus architecture, enables weaponry of both Soviet and western origin to be adopted by Z-10. Offensive weaponry consists of machine guns, cannons, rockets and missiles. The stub wings have two hardpoints each for a total of four, each hardpoint being able to carry up to 4 missiles for a total of up to 16. Cannon and machine guns Internal armament consists of a gun mount installed on the chin of the aircraft (likely to be of 30mm calibre). Two stub wings provide attachment points for external ordnance or gun pods.Z-10 Attack Helicopter - SinoDefence.com The guns are mounted either in the chain gun form, or in the turret. All guns on the Z-10 can be used either against ground targets or aerial targets, and can be directly aimed by pilots‚Äô HMS. In the turret form, automatic grenade launcher can also be housed next to the machine gun in the same turret. Two types of autocannons are available for Z-10, with the first being a 23 mm automatic chain gun indigenously developed by China, another autocannon that can be mounted on the Z-10 is the Chinese reverse-engineered 25 mm M242 Bushmaster adopted for helicopter use. Originally mounted on the NVH-4 derivative of Type 85 AFV, the Chinese military modified the gun for aerial use. According to Chinese claims, the 25 mm M242 Bushmaster is the most accurate among all three autocannons of its kind in use with the Chinese military, in both ground and aerial formats. The relatively low reliability of the 25 mm autocannon also has prevented the ground version from being widely adopted. Guns for Z-10 can also be mounted in the turret form, but this is limited to small caliber machine guns. The largest type of machine gun that may be fitted to the Z-10 turret is a single 14.5 mm Gatling gun, while the smaller caliber 12.7 mm or 7.62 mm machine guns may be mounted either in single barrel or twin barrel forms. When armed with these smaller caliber machine guns, the coverage is increased to 180 degrees as opposed to the 130 degrees of larger caliber autocannons. The turret is flexible enough to incorporate configurations such as a single barrel machine gun and an automatic grenade launcher with calibers ranging from 30 mm to 40 mm, as in the AH-1 Cobra. Guided and unguided missiles A CAIC Z-10 showing its weaponry The air-to-surface missiles deployed by Z-10 include the domestic HJ-8, HJ-9 and HJ-10 anti-tank missiles. The HJ-10 is thought to be similar to AGM-114 Hellfire and it has an anti-helicopter capability in addition to anti- tank capability. In July 2011, Xinhua News Agency released a photo of Z-9WA firing ADK10 air-to-ground missile. ADK10 is reported to be the official name of HJ10 missile. The main air-to-air missile deployed by Z-10 is TY-90, a missile specifically designed for use by helicopters in aerial combat. TY-90 is claimed to have greater lethality than the MANPAD missiles usually carried by helicopters. The Chinese FN-6 and QW series missiles can also be deployed, as with other non-Chinese MANPADs. TY-90 and MANPADs are often carried in pairs, with a total of 4 carried. When using larger air-to-air missiles such as PL-9 or similar missiles such as AIM-9 Sidewinder, the total number is reduced to 2. The Z-10 fired its first air-to-air missile in mid-August 2013 during a live-fire drill and successfully intercepted low-altitude targets.Chinese WZ-10 Attack Helicopter Launches First Air-to-Air Missile - Deagel.com, 26 August 2013 Z-10 can be armed with a wide variety of unguided rockets ranging from 20 mm to 130 mm caliber. The largest rockets tested were a type of 130 mm rocket that were carried on the hardpoints just as missiles are carried, while smaller caliber rockets were mounted in conventional rocket pods. The most frequently used rockets are those ranging from 57 mm to 90 mm and a total of 4 pods can be carried under the stub wings, one under each hardpoint. A family of guided 90 mm rackets produced by a subsidiary of Norinco,HJG the Harbin Jiancheng Group (ÂìàÂ∞îÊª®Âª∫ÊàêÈõÜÂõ¢ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), was first revealed in the 9th Zhuhai Airshow held in November 2012, designated as Sky Arrow 90 (Tianjian 90 or Tian Jian 90, 90). =OADS= OADS (Optical Air Data System) is mounted at the right side of the cockpit between the exit of the pilot and gunner. Strategic implications In June 2012, United States charged United Technologies and two of its subsidiaries, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Hamilton Sundstrand, of selling engine control software to China which aided in the development of the CAIC Z-10. While the Chinese defence ministry denied that China bought or used the software, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Hamilton Sundstrand agreed to pay more than $75 million to the U.S. government to settle the charges. Orders China's Army Ground Forces have ordered of 118 with 106 delivered, and 12 more to go, as of 2018. The Pakistan Army acquired 3 units for evaluation with a follow up order for 7 more, but in 2017 they opted for the TAI/AgustaWestland T129 and plan to manufacture aircraft parts in Pakistan.

It is owned by Arrow Retail of Dallas and anchored by Macy's. The mall features three floors of shopping with the third level serving mostly as professional office spaces, a food court, and U.S. Education Corporation's Carrington College. History Ideas for Lloyd Center were conceived as early as 1923. The mall was named after southern Californian oil company executive Ralph B. Lloyd (1875‚Äì1953) who wished to build an area of self-sufficiency that included stores and residential locations. However, the mall wasn't built until 37 years later, due to major events such as World War II, the Great Depression, and Portland's conservative anti-development attitude. =1960‚Äì1988= The mall opened August 1, 1960 in a 100-store, open-air configuration. At the time, it was the largest shopping center in the Pacific Northwest and claimed to be the largest in the country. In 1960, Lloyd Center was located very close to the downtown retail core and was the first major retail development to seriously challenge it, aimed almost exclusively at commuters utilizing Portland's then-growing freeway system, especially the adjacent Banfield Expressway. The original anchor stores were Meier & Frank at the center, Best's and Nordstrom's Shoes anchoring the west end, J. C. Penney and Woolworth anchoring the east, and J. J. Newberry the north. The Newberry store was the national chain's largest at the time of its opening. The Seattle-based Nordstrom's Shoes chain acquired Best's apparel in 1963 and rebranded all locations as Nordstrom Best in 1967. The Nordstrom nameplate was adopted in 1973. As of 1971, Lloyd Center's five largest stores were, from largest to smallest, Meier & Frank (314,000 square feet), Newberry's (100,000 sq. ft.), Penney's (97,370 sq. ft.), F. W. Woolworth (62,734 sq. ft.) and Nordstom Best (52,891 sq. ft.). The first significant expansion to the mall since its opening in 1960 was made in fall 1972, adding six stores. The expansion included the addition of a Lipman's store. In 1973, the JCPenney store was remodeled and expanded to . Frederick & Nelson acquired the Lipman's chain in 1979, and the Lloyd Center Lipman's store was renamed Frederick & Nelson.\\"Tonight we close our doors as Lipman's ....\\". Advertisement in The Oregonian, March 30, 1979, p. A3. The store subsequently went through a dizzying succession of owners, nameplates and locations within the mall. It appears that, in 1988, Nordstrom moved into the old Lipmans/Frederick and Nelson building. The Lipmans name was apparently reinstated at a new location in the north end of the mall in 1987, only to be replaced by that of Spokane-based The Crescent later in the same year. In March 1988, the store was acquired by Bellevue, Washington-based Lamonts. =1988‚Äìpresent: Renovation and new look= Lloyd Center in 2017 By 1987, the mall was aging and enclosed malls were becoming the norm across the United States. Between 1988 and 1991 the mall was gradually renovated. Nordstrom ended up demolishing the Lipmans store and opening an entirely new location on its space in August 1990. The former Nordstrom spaces had been gutted and refitted as inline stores, followed by a mall-wide renovation around late 1990-early 1991 which fully enclosed the mall and added a food court. The remodeled shopping hub was rededicated in August 1991. Glimcher Realty Trust bought the center in 1998 for $167 million. JCPenney closed in June 1998 and was replaced by Sears in November 1999. The Newberry's store closed in 2001, when the entire chain went out of business; it was the last Newberry's in Oregon.Heinz, Spencer (April 2, 2001). \\"Five-and-dime retailer will soon ring up its final sale\\". The Oregonian, p. B1. Meier & Frank became Macy's in 2006. Glimcher Realty Trust sold 60% of the center to Blackstone Real Estate Partners in 2010 after a deal to sell the entire mall fell through the year before. Lloyd Center was sold by Glimcher to Cypress Equities Real Estate Investment Management in June 2013. In February 2014, it was announced that Nordstrom would be closing its store at the mall; the store closed on January 10, 2015. The Sears store in 2017 An 18-month, $50 million renovation began in March 2015, alongside the closure of the Regal 8 cinema. Entrances to the mall will be made more pedestrian-friendly and the central space will be reconfigured with a spiral staircase. The changes are partially in response to the increasing population of the Lloyd District from newly constructed apartment buildings. In August 2016, Sears sold its space to the mall's owners, who were reported to be planning a major remodeling of its upper floors, demolishing the fourth floor and expanding the third floor. On January 4, 2018, Sears announced that its Lloyd Center store would be closing in early April 2018 as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide. On December 14, 2018, the TJX Companies announced that Marshalls would be closing in January 2019 which left Macy's as the only anchor left.https://katu.com/news/local/lloyd-district-dealing-with-handful-of- business-closures-in-recent-months Public transit Entrance to the mall Lloyd Center is accessible by TriMet's MAX light rail service, which stops one block south of the mall, at the Lloyd Center/Northeast 11th Avenue station. The area is also served by several bus stops around the mall facility. The Portland Streetcar's A Loop has a stop two blocks west of the Lloyd Center, at NE 7th & Halsey. C-Tran serves Lloyd Center with its commuter express route 157 from 99th Street Transit Center in Vancouver. Court cases Lloyd Center has played a role in the history of freedom of speech in the United States, especially with regard to the scope of free speech within private shopping centers. Lloyd Center was the defendant in the landmark cases of Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, , a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving First Amendment rights and private property, and Lloyd Corp. v. Whiffen, 307 Or. 674, 773 P.2d 1293 (1989), a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court.

In 2008, a mob of up to 400 men was observed by journalists surrounding and harassing women, leading Australian Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick to comment that such conduct fosters an environment that may lead to rape. Security staff were described as \\"powerless\\" to stop the mob, although event organiser Chic Henry stated that he was happy with the performance of security. In 2011, another mob was alleged to have occurred. In 2017, Summernats announced its zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment.

It consists of four blocks of retail, dining, parking, and an office tower named Pioneer Tower. The mall itself is spread out between four buildings, interconnected by skywalks or underground mall sections. The footprint of the entire complex consists of four full city blocks, bisected by SW Yamhill and Fourth, bounded north-south by SW Morrison and Taylor Streets and east-west by SW Third and Fifth Avenues.Directory. Pioneer Place. Retrieved 1 September 2012. In 2014, Pioneer Place was the third-highest selling mall in the United States based on sales per square foot, sitting just behind Bal Harbour Shops and The Grove at Farmers Market. History Exterior of Pioneer Place Pioneer Place I began construction in the late 1980s and opened in 1990. The development was built in two phases, the names of which are reflected in the names of the two main mall buildings. Pioneer Place I, or The \\"Atrium Shops\\"/Zone A, opened in 1990 and was developed with assistance from the Portland Development Commission. Pioneer Place II, or The \\"Rotunda Shops\\"/Zone B, is located across Fourth Avenue to the east. Construction on Pioneer Place II began in 1998, and at the time was to add at a cost of around $60 million. Saks Fifth Avenue closed its store at the mall in 2010, with H&M; taking over the portion that had been Saks men's store later that year. The remaining parts of the Saks footprint was demolished in 2012 to make way for a new Apple Store and a Yard House restaurant. In February 2017, shared workspaces provider WeWork signed a lease to take of space, one of their first leases in a mall. Amenities The center has of space and 66 stores. Pioneer Place I and II contain four levels, including a basement level. The top floor of Pioneer Place II houses a Regal Cinemas theater. Cascades, the food court, is located underground below Pioneer Tower/Zone C, which also connects to a parking garage. That parking garage, located to the south, also contains retail space, home to Tiffany & Co.. The northern lower above-ground levels of the block with Pioneer Tower housed Saks Fifth Avenue. =Public transit= The Atrium Shops (interior) Pioneer Place I faces the Fifth Avenue section of the Portland Transit Mall, served by several TriMet bus routes and MAX Light Rail. It is served by all five lines of the MAX system, with its Fifth Avenue side being across the street from the Pioneer Place/5th Avenue station (southbound service), and with the Pioneer Courthouse/6th Avenue station (northbound service) and \\"Pioneer Square\\" stations (eastbound and westbound service) being only one block away. Pioneer Place II is similarly only one block away from the Third Avenue station. Until 2020, building I had been flanked by directly adjacent MAX stations on Morrison and Yamhill Streets since its opening 30 years earlier, but those stations were closed in 2020 in order to reduce travel time for MAX riders through downtown and due to the stations' close proximity to the nearest other stations on the same MAX lines.

As the flame front propagates along the tube, the unburned gases ahead of the front are compressed, and hence heated. The amount of compression varies depending on the geometry and can range from twice to eight times the initial pressure. Where multiple vessels are connected by piping, ignition of gases in one vessel and pressure piling may result in a deflagration to detonation transition and very large explosion pressure.Center for Chemical Process Safety Safe Design and Operation of Process Vents and Emission Control, Center for Chemical Process Safety/AIChE 2006 pages 45-46 In electrical equipment in hazardous areas, if two electrical enclosures are connected by a conduit, an explosion of a gas in one of the compartments travels through the conduit into the next enclosure.Ernest C.

Heat, arcs or sparks escape from the equipment and ignite any gas or vapour that may be around.

Its use is voluntary: if a pilot denies LAHSO clearance the Air Traffic Controller must revector the aircraft to ensure adequate separation from other aircraft landing or departing an intersecting runway or crossing down field. A heightened level of situational awareness is necessary, and student pilots or pilots not familiar with LAHSO should not participate in the program. Although used in the US, many countries do not permit LAHSO clearances, and some airlines' operating procedures do not allow their acceptance in countries that do permit them. LAHSO was previously called SOIR (Simultaneous Operations on Intersecting Runways), and incorporates and expands all SOIR definitions. Types There are three main types, to land and hold on the runway: * Intersecting Runway: before the intersection with another runway that will have another aircraft taking off or landing. * Intersecting Taxiway: before the intersection with a taxiway that will have other aircraft taxiing for takeoff or parking. * Point on Runway: before a designated point. This is the newest type, used when safety precautions are needed due to hazards concerning other runways or taxiways, or hazards for a landing plane on its runway (ice, for instance). Requirements Non-air carrier aircraft: ceiling 1,000 feet and visibility 3 miles. Air carrier aircraft: ceiling 1,500 feet and visibility 5 miles, unless the landing runway is equipped with precision approach path indicator (PAPI) or visual approach slope indicator (VASI), in which case 1,000 feet ceiling and 3 miles visibility must be applicable. For configurations requiring a RLP, the ceiling and visibility may differ.

Geography  Yaraka is in Central West Queensland, Australia. It was the terminus of a Yaraka branch railway line. It is located south of Longreach, west of Blackall and south of the town of Isisford. The landscape is open Mitchell grass downs country, which provides good grazing country. Grey Range is located near Yaraka and is characterised by rocky ridges, spinifex grass and mulga. History Yaraka Railway Station in 1917 shortly after the rail link was opened. The Queensland Premier, Mr T. J. Ryan visited the new site. The first European to pass through the area was Edmund Kennedy in 1847. In 1860, graziers began to populate the area and farm sheep and cattle. In 1910, the Queensland Government authorised the building of the railway line in Western Queensland to support the pastoral industry. However, only a quarter of the line was built and Yaraka became the end of the Yaraka branch railway line. Yaraka became a town when the Yaraka branch railway line from Emmet opened in April 1917.The Western Champion and General Advertiser for the Central ‚Äì Western Districts, 14 April 1917, p. 7.

In the 1950s Yaraka railway station became a major centre for the transportation of cattle. In November 1953 over 5,442 cattle were handled which was the largest number since the line opened in 1917. It was noted that this was unusual in these country yards and that Yaraka was unsurpassed in this respect.The Longreach Leader, 18 December 1953, p. 10. Online reference The line was officially closed on 14 October 2005 and has been dismantled. These days however Yaraka has become known as one of Queensland's 'vanishing towns' and its population is declining. In 2009, the school closed due to low student numbers.

Nottage () is a small village part of Porthcawl in Bridgend County Borough, Wales. It is also the name of an electoral ward to the town and county councils. History The original ancient village of Nottage, built in a defensive position from the outset, was sited on a small hill near an inlet leading to the sea. The location is speculated to have been chosen to reduce the risks of attacks by Vikings. Artifacts found in and near Nottage hint the presence in the area of the Beaker culture, Celts and Romans. In the 12th Century, William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester gave 'New Town in Margam' to his supporter Richard of Cardiff. Nottage lay just outside it. Already the location of a Celtic church, Norman influence grew in the area, and the Parish of Newton- Nottage was formed in around 1300. Nottage Court (also known as 'The Grange' and 'Noche Court', later 'Ty Mawr') were administered by Margam Abbey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was sold to the Lougher family in 1545 and rebuilt in around 1570, though parts of the pre-1570 structure remain, despite another extensive renovation in 1855. Accessed 26 February 2017 The ancient church of Nottage was located beside the present Rose and Crown pub. A manorial survey of 1630 shows that there was already a church in the village which was associated with Saint David (though the present church dates only from the 1940s). Nottage became the site of some of the earliest Nonconformist activity in Wales. John Myles had preached there in 1657. After the Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, Walter Cradock and Howell Thomas were authorised to preach there. Methodist and Baptist presences in Nottage were formalised in 1743 and 1789 respectively. Accessed 26 February 2017 In 1849, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales recorded that Nottage had a population of 467. Accessed 26 February 2017 It had risen to 1,082 by 1861 as recorded in the original Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, which described Nottage as 'a decayed watering-place'. Date accessed: 26 February 2017 Nottage was formerly served by Nottage Halt railway station on the Porthcawl branch-line, which closed in 1965. West Park Primary School was opened in 1971. Facilities Nottage has a convenience store, a hair salon named salon Amici, a primary school and a few public houses and bed and breakfast establishments. The village is the location of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, founded in 1891. There are two places of worship in Nottage: * St David's, operated by the Church in Wales. Parish of Newton Nottage. Accessed 26 February 2017. * Nottage General Baptist & Unitarian Church, shared by Unitarians and Baptists. Governance Nottage is an electoral ward to Porthcawl Town Council, electing four of the 19 town councillors. The electoral ward has also elected a county councillor to Bridgend County Borough Council since 1999. The ward has generally elected a Liberal Democrat councillor with the exception of the 2004 council elections.

These soldiers started generating a demand for prostitution. Monarchs who followed Peter I had different approaches to prostitution, ranging from complete abolition to decriminalization. By the late 19th century, prostitution was legal in the Russian Empire and prostitutes were issued a special \\"yellow ticket\\" ID cards. Numerous brothels existed in most cities, ranging greatly in class and price. Customers included diverse groups ranging from the aristocracy to the working class. Legally, only women were allowed to own brothels. However, illegal street prostitution was still dominated by male pimps. The term kot (, tomcat) was used for a male pimp, while a female pimp was referred to as a bandersha (). Following the opening of Japan, Vladivostok would become the focus of settlement for Japanese emigrating to Russia. A branch of the was opened there in 1876. See section \\"Japanese Communities within the Russian Far East and Their Economic Activities\\" Their numbers grew to 80 people in 1877 and 392 in 1890; women outnumbered men by a factor of 3:2, and many worked as prostitutes (Karayuki- san). (Pages 47-49) However, their community remained small compared to the more numerous Chinese and Korean communities; an 1897 Russian government survey showed 42,823 Chinese, 26,100 Koreans, but only 2,291 Japanese in the whole of the Primorye area. A large portion of the migration came from villages in northern Ky≈´sh≈´. In the Russian Far East, east of Lake Baikal, Japanese prostitutes and merchants made up the majority of the Japanese community in the region after the 1860s. Japanese nationalist groups like the Black Ocean Society (Geny≈çsha) and Amur River Society-(Kokury≈´kai), glorified and applauded the 'Amazon army' of Japanese prostitutes in the Russian Far East and Manchuria and enrolled them as members. Certain missions and intelligence gathering were performed around Vladivostok and Irkutsk by Japanese prostitutes. Before 1917 there were said to be between 25000 and 30000 prostitutes in Moscow. Prophylactoriums, medical treatment centres, were established in 1925 to treat alcoholics and prostitutes. By 1929 there were five in Moscow. The prophylactorium board in Moscow estimated that there were 3000 prostitutes in Moscow in 1928. Handicraft cooperatives were established to provide alternative employment for them. According to secret research carried out in the late 1920s, almost 60% of urban Soviet men were using the services of prostitutes. There was also a separate category of prostitutes, the ‚Äòintergirls‚Äô who worked in hotels for foreign tourists and accepted payment only in foreign currencies. Women who worked in ordinary hotels and at stations often had protection from the local police, but those in the luxury hotels were under the wing of the KGB. Prostitution has been illegal in Russia since the establishment of the Soviet Union. However, during the post-Soviet years, this industry experienced significant growth. \\"Tochka\\" \\"Tochka\\" () is a popular euphemism for an outdoor market for prostitutes in Moscow and other large Russian cities, a word literally meaning 'point' or 'location' in Russian. (The word \\"tochka\\" may also be used in many other contexts. Its usage is originated from the notion \\"a point on the map\\". Initially it was used in military and geologist slang to denote, e.g., a military or geologist base or other specific location. Over time its usages was expanded. For example, in alcoholics' parlance, a \\"tochka\\" is a place where vodka is sold.) Moscow city government actions Starting from the late 1990s, the Moscow city government made many noticeable attempts to eliminate prostitution in Russia and there is serious jail time for prostitution to eliminate these markets, other than to eliminate some of the more obvious points along Tverskaya, Moscow's main avenue. Tochkas are controlled by organized criminal gangs that bribe local police departments in order to remain in business. Instead, the city police randomly checked the documents of women traveling alone after dark. For this reason, prostitutes often carried a hundred rubles with which to bribe the police.Nyet to Trafficking, Nationalreview Online, June 18, 2003Stanley, Alessandra.

His band, known as the Swan Lake or Little Rock Band, hunted \\"in southwestern Minnesota and southeastern Dakota ... between Swan Lake and Coteau des Prairies,\\" until forced to move to reservation land near the Minnesota River in the wake of the 1857 Spirit Lake Massacre.

Its highest office was held by , first Archbishop of Mainz and then of Regensburg. He had been the first among the princes of the Holy Roman Empire and styled its Archchancellor, and as such was given the first rank among the princes of the new Confederation and the title of ', 'Prince Primate'. As such he presided over the College of Kings and the of the Confederation, a senate-like assembly which never actually assembled. During his term as Prince Primate, Dalberg was Archbishop of Regensburg (in Bavaria) and at first ' (ruling Prince) of Aschaffenburg. Since September 19, 1806 his territories included the former and on February 16, 1810 Dalberg was promoted to the strictly secular rank of Grand Duke of Frankfurt, in chief of another former (on the lower Main, enclaved in the Electorate of Mainz, now in Hessen). At the same time, Napoleon appointed his stepson Eug√®ne de Beauharnais ‚Äî excluded from the French imperial succession ‚Äî as heir to the Grand Duchy. At the eve of the collapse of the First French Empire, Dalberg resigned his secular positions and Beauharnais succeeded him as Grand Duke, though this had no practical effect, as the dissolution of the Confederation (carved up into a revised set of monarchies) also rendered the position moot. Hungary In virtue of his dignity as Primate of the Habsburg dynasty's Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary, the Archbishop of Esztergom enjoyed extraordinary privileges, resulting in his being titled Prince Primate. The primate was entitled to hold national synods, was of the Holy Roman Church, and therefore had the right, inside of his legation (territory where he represented the Pope), to have the cross carried before him, dealt directly with Rome and had the right of visitation in the episcopal sees and the religious houses in Hungary, except the exempt Archabbey of Pannonhalma (S. Martinus in Monte Pannoni√¶). Since 1715 the primate had also been a ', a ruling Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, entitled Prince Primate. He was the chief and privy chancellor of the Hungarian kingdom, and thus keeper of the great seal. Formerly he was also a member of the supreme court, and still earlier governor, viceroy and ' ('hereditary' Chief Count) of Gran. To the primate also belonged the right (delegated regalia) to superintend the royal mint at Kremnica (, ), for which he received a significant sum from its seigniorage revenues, called ' ('right of'). By ancient custom, he had the right to crown the King of Hungary and anoint the queen. By a gift of archiepiscopal property he was at one time able to confer nobility ('), another rarely delegated princely prerogative (usually only knighting was allowed to non-sovereign nobility). Another privilege was his right to take an oath before a court of justice through his deputy, and not personally. The primate was also chief priest and chancellor of the Hungarian national Order of St. Stephen, established in 1764. As first banneret (') of Hungary, he was a Magnate, i.e. member of the Upper House.

He did play four more Sheffield Shield games in that 1997/98 season, including two four-wicket hauls, but in 1998/99 played just two games for just one wicket.

The school was founded in 1630. It has since grown to be one of the most respected and highest performing schools in the East Midlands. The school has been awarded specialist sports and humanities status. The school attracts students from not only the town of Caistor, but also several surrounding settlements, including Grimsby, Brigg and Market Rasen. The current Headmaster is Alistair Hopkins who took up the position in January 2017, becoming the school's 27th head. Caistor Grammar was ranked first in Lincolnshire at both GCSE and A Level results in 2017. The school was ranked first at GCSE in 2018 and is ranked first at A level and GCSE in 2019. In the 2017 Times newspaper league tables it is in the top ten mixed state schools in the country. The school was named Sunday Times Parent Power State Secondary School of the Year (East Midlands) 2018 in November 2017 and was the named the top school in the East Midlands by the Sunday Times in November 2019.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-uk- secondary-schools-guide-east-midlands-tmmdchdg5  History  Caistor Grammar School is an endowed school dating from the reign of Charles I. The Dissolution of the Monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII had destroyed the principal sources of education of the times, and the numerous schools endowed throughout England during the following reigns are evidence that public- spirited men recognised the need created and endeavoured to meet it. Among others was Francis Rawlinson, of South Kelsey, who died in 1630, bequeathing money to endow a school at Caistor, and William Hansard of Biscathorpe, who supplemented the original gift in 1634. The monies given were invested in the purchase of land at Cumberworth, and of the rectorial tithes of Bilsby, of which the governors are still lay impropriators. The original trustees were Sir Edward Asycough of South Kelsey, Sir William Pelham of Brocklesby and Sir Christopher Wray, Lord Chief Justice, and Jonathan Beltwick. Other trustees shouldered their responsibilities from time to time until 1885 when, under the Endowed Schools Act 1869, the Foundation was placed under an elective body of governors, the Vicar of Caistor being an ex-officio member. In 1908 the school was recognised by the Board of Education. On 11 November 1931 it celebrated its tercentenary in the presence of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. Lindsey County Council, based in Lincoln, proposed to close the grammar school as it decided there were not enough numbers for three grammar schools in the area. On 18 February 1960 fifty-two boys and girls at the schools walked the twenty six miles to Lincoln. They gave a petition to the Council's Chairman, Sir Weston Cracroft Amcotts. Following national press coverage the school was saved from closure. =School visits= In 2008, The Times journalist Robert Crampton used his Beta Male column to ask for invitations to give speeches, to improve his public speaking skills. He received 400 invitations, but only accepted a handful, including Caistor Grammar School. He visited the school to give the speech in 2009, subsequently reporting on the experience in his newspaper. In 2013 the chairwoman of UK Sport, Baroness Campbell, opened a new building commemorating the five students from the school who took part in the London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay. The former deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph and current Daily Mail columnist Simon Heffer visited the school in 2014 in recognition of the school newspaper, Caistor Focus, winning The Best School Newspaper category at the Shine Media Awards for two consecutive years. On 21 September 2017, the school welcomed journalist and chair of the Hull UK City of Culture 2017 trust Rosie Millard to address students and parents in the annual awards evening.  School buildings  The school library The school occupies a site close to the centre of the small market town of Caistor, with remarkably steep topography. The ironstone school hall dates from 1631, and is still in daily use. The school library alongside is housed in what was the Congregational Church, built in 1842. Casterby House, once a large private house, later one of three boarding houses, and now the Sixth Form Centre, overlooks the churchyard from the south side of the school gates. The name Casterby House is derived from former pupil Sir Henry Newbolt's semi- autobiographical novel the Twymans, in which Caistor is given the name Casterby.https://archive.org/stream/twymanstaleofyou00newb#page/n65/mode/2up The traditional teaching block dates from the 1930s, but was extended and modernised in 1984. The Manning Building, replacing several prefabricated buildings, was opened in 1984. Two new technology buildings were added in 1993 and 1994. Lindsey House, once a purpose-built boarding house, was remodelled into classrooms and the dining room. Beech House, traditionally the residence of the headmaster, is now where the site manager lives. There was an additional building, Grove House, but this was demolished because of structural problems. The school previously owned several other buildings in Caistor, including the \\"Red House\\" next to Bank Lane, which were used as boarding accommodation. These have now however been sold off. In 2010, as part of the Government Building Schools for the Future scheme, Caistor Grammar School secured funding to build an extension to Lindsey House, to provide renovated music facilities, another ICT facility and a room for food technology, something that is new to the CGS curriculum. The funding was secured only days before the scheme was scrapped by the Educational Secretary Michael Gove. The facilities were completed by the following Christmas, and were officially opened by celebrity chef Rachel Green on 24 May 2011. The food technology facilities were removed in 2018 to provide for an extended and remodelled dining area, stemming from the facilities' lack of use. In 2013, a new science building was constructed adjacent to Lindsey House, named the Olympic Torch Building to honour the five CGS pupils who carried the torch for the London 2012 Olympic Games, as well as Jordan Duckitt, one of the seven young athletes to light the cauldron. A former student donated her Olympic torch which is on display at the main entrance. The building was opened in September 2013 by UK Sport chair Baroness Sue Campbell.  Departments and curriculum  Pupils are taught a variety of traditional subjects and modern languages remain compulsory to GCSE level. The school began delivering the Extended Project Qualification in September 2017. From September 2019, students will study 10 GCSEs. A level Psychology was also introduced in September 2019.  Entry exam  As a selective school, Caistor Grammar School requires prospective pupils to pass the 11-plus. The current exam is set by the school. The first exam is a verbal reasoning paper and the second is multiple choice. The exams are held at the school approximately two weeks apart, and the results are issued up to a month after the last exam. In the event that more candidates pass the exam than there are places available, places are offered first to pupils from within the school's catchment area, which is defined as 6.5 miles in a straight line from the Head Master's Office to the applicant's residence\\". Candidates from outside the catchment area are awarded places depending on their score in the examinations. Candidates that pass but cannot be offered a place are organised onto a waiting list. The exams can be retaken at Year 9, but there is no guarantee that the child will get a place, and the only guarantee is that the child is moved to a higher position on the waiting list. Entry to the Sixth Form is dependent on an applicant's GCSE results.  Houses  All pupils belong to one of three houses which are named after the school's founder, Francis Rawlinson; the school patron, Sir Edward Ayscough; and the school benefactor, William Hansard. Pupils represent their house in a wide range of interhouse competitions throughout the school. These include the annual sports day, house music and house drama events. Merits awarded also count for a pupil's house, with the house shield being awarded each year to the house with the most. Sixth form pupils take over most of the running of each house. Every year lower sixth pupils run for the positions of house captains, sports captains or performing arts captains (each with a male and female role). Each house also has a representing colour: Hansard is yellow Ayscough is blue Rawlinson is green  Notable Old Caistorians  * Joanne Clifton, professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing * Kevin Clifton, professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing * Dawn French, actress\\"Dawn French Meets up with Old Caistor School Pals\\", Market Rasen Mail 13 November 2008.

He played primarily as a for Balmain in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership. He was one of the leading hookers from the mid-1980s until his retirement at the end of the 1994 season. Along with Wayne Pearce, Paul Sironen and Steve Roach, Elias and his Balmain teammates formed one of the best forward packs in the modern era during the late 1980s. Since his retirement as a player, Elias has pursued media and business interests. He is the uncle of former Wests Tigers and now Parramatta Eels five-eighth Mitchell Moses. Playing career =Early career= After migrating to Australia from his native Lebanon at a young age, Elias was a fan of rugby league from very young days and played his first rugby for Holy Cross College Ryde in the late 1970s as a halfback, representing Australia in the Schoolboys team from 1979 to 1981. He was graded by Balmain in 1981, and transferred quickly to the hooking position where he remained for the rest of his career. When he first played first grade in 1982 his potential as a teenager was immediately noticed, and he developed so well that by 1984 he was widely tipped for major representative honours. While attending Holy Cross College, Ryde, Elias played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1979 and 1981. =Representative Debuts= These came Elias' way in 1985 when he played in New South Wales' first team to win a State of Origin series, and was selected for the New Zealand tour that year. Elias was subsequently selected for the following year's Kangaroo Tour, which was undefeated through England and France, however Elias was unable to displace Royce Simmons as the Test hooker. Elias was instrumental in Balmain's advancement to the NSWRL Grand Final against the Canterbury Bulldogs in 1988, despite experiencing a painful rib cartilage injury during the lead-up to the finals series. Though they lost 12‚Äì24 to Canterbury, Elias won the Rugby League Week Player of the Year award (one of only two hookers to achieve this feat). He was selected for the 1988 World Cup, and only a broken thumb kept him out of representative honours in 1989. He was back at his best in Balmain's surge to the Grand Final that year, narrowly missing a vital field- goal attempt in the second half of the overtime defeat by the Canberra Raiders, a game in which Steve Walters began to assert his dominance as one of leading hookers in the game at that time. = State of Origin career = Elias made 19 appearances for the New South Wales State of Origin team between 1985 and 1994 and was named man-of-the-match on 3 occasions ( Game I 1990, Game I 1992 and Game III 1994). Elias played State of Origin with incredible passion and is remembered for his fiery clashes with Queensland hookers Kerrod and Steve Walters. He was honoured later in his career when he captained the Blues in six games in 1990‚Äì1991. An enduring image of State of Origin remains from 1992 when with blood streaming down his face he helped NSW to a 14‚Äì6 win in Sydney. The nickname given to him by Roy and HG for Roy and HG's State of Origin commentary was \\"Backdoor Benny\\" and \\"The Crimea Look\\". In 2005 he was named one of the 25 greatest ever NSW players. =1990s= Elias produced some of his best form during 1990, including: * Captaining NSW City in their 28‚Äì26 victory over NSW Country in the annual the City v Country match at the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS), scoring one of City's 5 tries on the day.1990 City vs Country Origin at Rugby League Project * Captaining NSW to their first Origin series victory over Queensland since 1986. The Blues win in Game 1 at the SFS was their first victory over Queensland since the exhibition game in Los Angeles in 1987. * Four test appearances on the 1990 Kangaroo tour (two against Great Britain and two against France). Elias was the man of the match in the second Ashes series Test match victory over Great Britain at Old Trafford in his first test match since the 1988 World Cup Final, and scored a try in the third test win at Elland Road. Elias was the Kangaroos vice-captain on the tour.Ben Elias - Australian tests at Rugby League Project However, 1991 was largely plagued by injury as Alan Jones replaced Warren Ryan as Balmain coach, and though Elias was fit again in 1992, he could not displace Steve Walters from his Test spot and had many competitors for the New South Wales jersey. 1993 was controversial, hit hard by suspension which prevented his re- establishing his representative career, but in 1994 Elias showed some wonderful form in the State of Origin series (man of the match in the last game) and even at times for the struggling Balmain coached by former teammate Wayne Pearce. Elias missed out on selection on the 1994 Kangaroo Tour, and at age 31, he announced his retirement as a player in December. Controversy Despite being diminutive in size compared to many of his opponents, Elias was a tough and aggressive player, and appeared to welcome physical confrontations. Elias and then South Sydney hooker Mario Fenech had a very competitive rivalry until Fenech left South Sydney in 1991. Elias admitted on The NRL Footy Show on 19 July 2007, that during the 1986 Semi-final between Balmain and Souths at the SCG, he was successful in getting Fenech sent off when he bit his own hand and then claimed the bite was done by Fenech. Without Fenech, Souths were knocked out of the finals race with Balmain winning 36‚Äì11. Elias released his autobiography, Balmain Benny (), towards the end of his career, touching on many of the controversial on and off-field incidents in his career. In 2000 Elias was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Post retirement career Following his retirement, Elias graduated from the University of Western Sydney and became a successful businessman as one of Australia's retail mobile phone sales pioneers and began rugby league radio commentary in Sydney. Elias also became the rugby league pundit for now defunct SBS Television 7pm weeknight sports program in the mid-2000s. During his playing days, Elias was regularly interviewed. Rugby league journalist Roy Masters referred to Elias as the clich√© king for his love, and occasionally incorrect use of, clich√©s and metaphors. Elias is currently a member of the Wests Tigers Board along with former teammate Paul Sironen. He is also a member of the advisory board of the Perth Glory FC. He has two children and lives in Sydney, Australia. Elias has been involved in the controversial development of the Balmain Leagues Club site, owning a 50 per cent stake in the company behind the development while urging club members to support the proposal.

Career Bonnor was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, and made his international debut in the first match played in England in 1880. Being very tall for the 19th century at 6 foot 6 inches he was also exceedingly strong and made the most of it with some powerful hitting, however at times his cavalier attitude led to some periods of poor scores as well. Two anecdotes testify to his enormous strength. First, during the Oval Test match of 1880 between England and Australia, he was out caught for two to a ball he had hit so high that by the time GF Grace had snaffled him, waiting directly underneath it on the boundary, he and his partner had almost completed their third run. \\"My heart stopped beating as I went on waiting [for the ball to come],\\" said Grace later. On the next tour, in 1882, Bonnor made a ¬£100 wager with a disbelieving fellow passenger on the SS Assam that he could, with his throw after stepping off the ship, send a cricket ball 100 yards: he won the wager by throwing the ball 119 yards and seven inches, done without a run up. WG Grace credits Bonnor with another throw of 130 yards, but legend has it that Grace himself threw even further in their one-on-one competition. Measured hits of his in practice included ones at Melbourne of 160 and 149 yards, and one of 147 at Mitcham Common in May 1880, which was carefully measured by the famed bowler James Southerton. Bonnor also reached 160 yards in actual play when, at Longsight in 1880, the Australians played the local XVIII and he sent Grace's cousin, W.R. Gilbert, a long way. In 1884, George Bonnor became the first player in Test cricket as well as international cricket history, to be dismissed hit wicket. Bonnor died of a heart attack, aged 57, in Orange, New South Wales, and is buried at the cemetery there.

It normally used the DECnet networking system as opposed to TCP/IP. Similar to Internet SMTP based mail, Mail-11 mail had To: Cc: and Subj: headers and date-stamped each message. Mail-11 was one of the most widely used email systems of the 1980s, and was still in fairly wide use until as late as the mid-1990s. Messages from Mail-11 systems were frequently gatewayed out to SMTP, Usenet, and Bitnet systems, and thus are sometimes encountered browsing archives of those systems dating from when Mail-11 was in common use. Several very large DECnet networks with Mail-11 service existed, most notably ENET, which was DEC's worldwide internal network. Another big user was HEPNET, a network for the high energy physics research community that linked many universities and research labs. Mail-11 used two colons (::) rather than an at sign (@) to separate user and hostname, and hostname came first. Some example headers * To: THEWAL::HARKAWIK A message to user HARKAWIK on a machine or cluster of machines called THEWAL. Note that under VMS, usernames were not case-sensitive and were usually shown in uppercase, but under Ultrix, usernames were case-sensitive, and most sites followed the unix convention of using lower case usernames. Names of machines on a DECnet network were not case-sensitive. Thus, the header above implies that the mail is going to a VMS system, but the one following implies the user is on a Unix system. * To: DS5353::tabak A message to user tabak on node DS5353. Probably an Ultrix system. *From: GUESS::YERAZUNIS \\"it's.. it's DIP !\\" 21-SEP-1989 10:28:38.87 *To: DECWRL::\\"decvax!peregrine!dmi\\" *CC: YERAZUNIS This message was sent to the gateway at DEC's Western Research Labs, one of DEC's main Internet gateways. From there, it was expected to travel via uucp, from host decvax to host peregrine to user dmi. Since the timestamp is present, this must be a copy of a message that has already been sent, but since the From address is still in Mail-11 form, the text above must be copied from the local CC of the message rather than from the version that went through the gateway. Unlike SMTP mail, mail readers did not support automatic signatures; many users developed the habit of changing their personal name setting to be some interesting or amusing quotation. * To: IN%\\"president@whitehouse.gov\\" The message is to be gatewayed to another network, in this case to the Internet SMTP protocol, and then delivered to the user president at the domain whitehouse.gov * To: HEPNET::TUHEP::SLIWA The message has to go through two machines. First, it is given to the node HEPNET, which then passes the machine to the node TUHEP, where it is then delivered to the user SLIWA. * From: \\"TGV::MCMAHON\\"@yoyodyne.com Mail from user MCMAHON on a machine or cluster named TGV, that was passed out of an Internet SMTP gateway by yoyodyne.com.

Life and career Groube's father was Horatio Groube, a Congregational minister who was among the first white settlers in New Plymouth, where Tom was born. The family left New Zealand in the early 1860s as a result of the Second Taranaki War and settled in Melbourne. Tom's paternal grandfather was a rear- admiral in the Royal Navy. Five feet eleven inches tall and slimly built, Tom Groube was a successful batsman in Melbourne club cricket in the late 1870s and early 1880s.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 223.Jack Pollard, Australian Cricket: The Game and the Players, Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney, 1982, p. 459. Between 1878 and 1885 he scored 2350 runs for the East Melbourne club at an average of 44. He played four matches of first-class cricket for Victoria between 1879 and 1881 but with little success. In 1878-79 he averaged 155.33 for East Melbourne, which helped him earn a place in the Australian team to England in 1880. He was a late replacement for Charles Bannerman, who had to withdraw from the selected touring team owing to illness.A. G. Moyes, Australian Cricket: A History, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1959, p. 210. Groube's highest first-class score was 61 against Yorkshire in 1880, which was the only time he reached 20 in first-class cricket. He played in the Test at The Oval in 1880, the first-ever Test match in England, but was not successful. He later toured New Zealand with the Australian team in 1880-81, his highest score there being 42 against Canterbury. In later years Groube wrote about cricket and Australian rules football in Victoria for the Weekly Times and The Herald under the pen-names \\"Old Cricketer\\" and \\"Rover\\".

The name means Lightning. By modern standards, she was extremely lightly armed with just one 'quick fire' 37 mm cannon and a single, fixed torpedo tube, but in her time she did pack a punch. Later boats of her class carried heavier armament. Lyn was later renamed Od, before she and most of her class were scrapped in 1920, long after they were obsolete. Small, nimble and fast craft for their time, the class provided much of the backbone for the Royal Norwegian Navy in the time leading up to Norwegian independence in 1905, and also during World War I. The class was often referred to as cigars due to their shape as seen on the photos. These qualities made them excellent torpedo boats - small size and low freeboard - but also made them very uncomfortable boats to crew, with cramped quarters and not very seaworthy. Over the 30 years the class was built, the size increased steadily, as well as the armament. The last boats in the class had a displacement almost twice that of Lyn, and two fixed torpedo tubes instead of just one.

In the Test he batted at No 11 and was the sixth bowler tried. With three wickets for 23 runs he was the most successful bowler in England's first innings and his 34 in Australia's second innings helped in a last-wicket partnership of 88 with his captain that avoided an innings defeat.

Legal and political career Moule resided in Melbourne at Clarence House (now known as the old Mansion nightclub) in 1876 whilst being educated at Melbourne Grammar School and took a law degree at Melbourne University, being called to the bar in 1879 and going into practice the following year. He rose to become a county court judge specialising in insolvency cases, retiring in April 1935, at which point he was the longest-serving member of the bench. Moule had a short but sensational career as a politician. Standing on a free trade platform in the Victoria state election of 1894, he beat the sitting member, the long-time minister and future premier of Victoria, Sir Thomas Bent. Bent was accused of various forms of corruption, and there had been some difficulty finding a candidate who would stand against him. As a member of the legislature until 1900, Moule chaired royal commissions on law reform and on factory and shop law. Personal life Moule married Jessie Osborne in 1885. One of their sons, Humphrey Osborne Moule, was killed in the First World War at Lone Pine, one of the main actions of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign. Moule died in August 1939 at the age of 81.

Also called niche marketing or target marketing, narrowcasting involves aiming media messages at specific segments of the public defined by values, preferences, demographic attributes, and/or subscription. Narrowcasting is based on the postmodern idea that mass audiences do not exist.Flera, Aguie. Mass Media Communication in Canada. Thompson Nelson. Scarborough: 2003. p. 379 While the first uses of the term appeared within the context of subscription radio programs in the late 1940s,Time Magazine (1948) Narrowcasting. Time, 51(5), p. 69. the term first entered the common lexicon due to computer scientist and public broadcasting advocate J. C. R. Licklider, who in a 1967 report envisioned > \\"a multiplicity of television networks aimed at serving the needs of > smaller, specialized audiences. 'Here,' stated Licklider, 'I should like to > coin the term \\"narrowcasting,\\" using it to emphasize the rejection or > dissolution of the constraints imposed by commitment to a monolithic mass- > appeal, broadcast approach.'\\" The term \\"narrowcasting\\" can also apply to the spread of information to an audience (private or public) which is by nature geographically limited‚Äîa group such as office employees, military troops, or conference attendees‚Äîand requires a localized dissemination of information from a shared source.  Origins and evolution on television  In the beginning of the 1990s, when American television was still mainly ruled by three major networks (ABC, CBS and NBC), it was believed that the greatest achievement was to promote and create content that would be directed towards a huge mass of people, avoiding completely those projects that might appeal to only a reduced audience. That was mainly due to the fact that specially in the earlier days of television, there was not much more competition. Nevertheless, this changed once independent stations, more cable channels, and the success of videocassettes started increasing and rising, which gave the audiences the possibility of having more options. Thus, this previous mass-oriented point of view started to change towards one that was, obviously, narrower. It was precisely the arrival of cable TV that allowed a much larger number of producers and programmers to aim at smaller audiences. For example, whereas MTV started off as the channel for those who loved music, it ended up with so many different shows that nowadays it rarely ever \\"trades in the 'music' of her name anymore\\", proving how the big networks evolved through a constant stage of diaspora with the aim to provide content appealing to a variety of audiences. Nowadays, despite the fact that the major networks keep promoting mostly content whose main aim is to get to a huge audience, narrowcasting has of course made its place in, for example, the way they schedule shows. For example, while one night they might choose to stream shows directed at teenagers, a different night they might want to focus on another specific kind of audience, such as those interested in documentaries. Therefore, they will be targeting what could be seen as a narrow audience, but collect their attention altogether as a mass audience on one night.  Social impact  This evolution towards narrowcasting was discussed in 1993 by Hamid Naficy, who focused on this change specifically in Los Angeles and how such a content directed towards a much more narrowed audience affected social culture. For example, with the rise of Middle Eastern television programs, these ended up constituting \\"part of the dynamic and multifaceted popular cultures produced and consumed by immigrant and exile communities in southern California.\\"Naficy, Hamid. \\"From Broadcasting to Narrowcasting: Middle Eastern Diaspora in Los Angeles.\\" Middle East Report, no. 180, 1993, pp. 31‚Äì34. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3013230. Therefore, more content that did not have the pressure to have a mass audience appeal to watch it, was able to be produced and promoted, which made it easier for minorities to feel represented in television.  Commercial application  Marketing experts are often interested in narrowcast media as a commercial advertising tool, since access to such content implies exposure to a specific and clearly defined prospective consumer audience. The theory being that, by identifying particular demographics viewing such programs, advertisers can better target their markets. Pre-recorded television programs are often broadcast to captive audiences in taxi cabs, buses, elevators and queues (such as at branches of the Post Office in the United Kingdom). For instance, the Cabvision network in London's black cabs shows limited pre-recorded television programs interspersed with targeted advertising to taxicab passengers. Television has made a transition from broadcasting to narrowcasting which has given advertisers a greater advantage when it comes to directing their messages to a specific demographic audience. For example, if an energy drink company wanted to target 18- to 25-year-old action sport athletes, they may purchase commercial time on a niche network that only narrowcasts mixed martial arts, thus making their message more valuable by marketing to a concentrated audience.  On the Internet  The Internet uses both a broadcast and a narrowcast model. Most websites are on a broadcast model since anyone with Internet access can view the sites (Wikipedia is a good example, this website can be received by anyone with an internet connection). However, sites that require one to log-in before viewing content are based more on the narrowcast model. Push technologies which send information to subscribers are another form for narrowcasting. Perhaps the best example of narrowcasting are electronic mailing lists where messages are sent only to individuals who subscribe to the list. Narrowcasting is also sometimes applied to podcasting, since the audience for a podcast is often specific and sharply defined. Dr. Jonathan Sterne of McGill University stated, \\"Narrowcasting is a form of broadcasting, if the latter term is understood as the 'wide dissemination of content through mechanical or electronic media'\\". Other one-way, traditional media approaches to narrowcasting, such as Internet Talk Radio, can be contrasted with broadcast radio programs. Narrowcasting approaches are focused on a specific (narrow) topic, whereas broadcast programs have a wider coverage of broad topics.  Interactive narrowcasting  A new type of narrowcasting is evolving in the form of interactive narrowcasting. Interactive narrowcasting enables shoppers to influence the content displayed via narrowcasting. One way of doing this is via a touch screen. More and more systems are being introduced into the narrowcasting market. User-driven content also provides an excellent medium for narrowcast marketing, provided the correct product is matched with the appropriate medium. These systems enable brands to communicate with their customers via a personal computer. The advantage of the majority of interactive narrowcasting projects is that they are more effective and less costly over time.

It was formerly known as Malaysia Shipyard and Engineering Sdn Bhd. MHB has been long involved in oil and gas engineering and construction works.http://www.mhb.com.my/ In March 2004, Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Bhd (MISC) increased its shareholding in MMHE to 65%, making it the majority shareholder of the Company.  History  Customer service in MHB office MHB Shipyard in 2008 MHB was incorporated in Malaysia in 1989 as a private limited company, under the name MSE Holdings Sdn Bhd. In June 2010, when MSE Holdings was converted into a public company, its name was changed to Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Berhad (MHB). On 29 October 2010, MHB was successfully listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, with its initial public offering (IPO) raising of RM2.03 billion. The IPO was the first in Malaysia to be conducted with an international strategic investor, Technip S.A. of France, a renowned player in project management, engineering and construction in the oil and gas industry. The history of MHB dates back to the incorporation of its wholly owned subsidiary, Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd (MMHE) in May 1973, under the name of Malaysia Shipyard and Engineering Sdn Bhd (MSE). MSE was established by the Government to advance Malaysia's maritime industrialisation programme. It was subsequently privatised and in 2006, became a wholly owned subsidiary of MISC Berhad. Being within the MISC Group of companies enabled the two organisations to align their goals and objectives to create greater synergies. One of MHB's achievements was the completion of the Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel FPSO Kikeh and the Kikeh Truss Spar for the Kikeh field in September 2006, Malaysia's first deepwater project. FPSO Kikeh was the first deepwater FPSO in Malaysia and the SPAR platform was the first to be installed outside of the Gulf of Mexico. Another milestone was achieved in 2007 when the MHB Group ventured abroad to operate and manage the Kiyanly yard, the only fabrication yard in Turkmenistan, on behalf of PETRONAS Carigali (Turkmenistan) Sdn Bhd. The most recent significant achievement was the completion of the Gumusut-Kakap semi-floating production system (FPS). It is the largest such facility in the world to have been fully built and integrated on land. The FPS left the MMHE West yard in Pasir Gudang, Johor on 13 May 2013. MMHE East and MMHE West are the only fabrication yards in South- east Asia to have constructed deepwater facilities in Malaysia for its international oil and gas clients. In April 2012, through the yard optimisation initiative, MHB expanded its yard size and capacity with the acquisition of new land for the fabrication of offshore oil and gas related structures, to cater to EPCIC works. The acquisition has significantly increased MHB's Pasir Gudang yard capacity from 69,700 MT to 129,700 MT, making MHB the largest fabricator in Malaysia today in terms of yard size and capacity. In conjunction with the acquisition, MMHE's yard in Jalan Pekeliling was renamed ‚ÄúMMHE West‚Äù, while the newly acquired yard is now known as ‚ÄúMMHE East‚Äù. There are approximately 4,000 operations and services support staff working at both yards in Pasir Gudang as well as in the Group Corporate Office in Menara Dayabumi, Kuala Lumpur on any given day. Today, MHB is recognised as a regional heavy engineering and deepwater support services provider for the oil and gas deepwater industry as well as a key player for LNG ship repair and dry docking. MHB is also a one-stop centre for marine conversion. Through partnerships with Samsung Heavy Industries of South Korea, Technip S.A. of France and ATB Riva of Italy, all of whom are leaders in their respective fields, we have improved MHB's offerings through the enhancement of capabilities and the transfer of technology.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=25538736  Core businesses  Asian hercules on duty = Offshore construction = MHB offers a full range of construction and engineering services for the offshore and onshore oil and gas industry, from detailed engineering design and procurement to construction, installation, hook-up and commissioning (EPCIC).

and hosiery. Founded in 1983 by Sophie Mirman and Richard P. Ross, SOCKSHOP became part of the Ruia Group in 2006, and is now based mainly online, with stores in the Manchester Arndale and The Lowry Outlet, as well as concessions across the United Kingdom.  Concept  Mirman said \\"People should be able to buy socks and stockings as easily as they buy newspapers\\".Lohr, Steve, A \\"Silly\\" Sock Idea Makes Millions, for The New York Times, November 23, 1987 She envisioned small shops that only sold women's tights, stockings, and socks. With this in mind, SockShop outlets were placed for convenience on busy city streets, in train stations, subway stations and at airports. They were small, between 400 and , and had no visible doors, which drew passers-by (as many as 1000 a day) into the store. Their stock featured bold colours, dramatic patterns and novelty designs in hundreds of styles. Prices were considered moderate at ¬£0.99 to ¬£24.99 per pair in 1987, with the priciest designs including gold-lace tights.  Founders  Sophie Mirman is the daughter of the milliner Simone Mirman. She started out as a junior secretary at Marks & Spencer before applying for the company's management training program. She then became a manager for the Marks & Spencer food department. In 1981, Mirman and her future husband Richard P. Ross became retail directors for a new speciality retailer, Tie Rack, which sold neckwear and accessories for men. They left in 1983 to launch SockShop .  Business history  = Early years = Mirman identified there was a need to buy stylish hosiery without hunting through large department stores, which at the time, dominated the British hosiery market. With the assistance of a Government loan guarantee programme for capital-short entrepreneurs, Mirman and Ross eventually launched SockShop in 1983. The first SockShop store was opened on the concourse of the Knightsbridge tube station. At that time, their ambitions were modest, with expectations of eventually having four or perhaps six retail outlets. However, by 1987, there were 52 stores in the Sock Shop chain and it became one of the fastest growing specialty retailing businesses in Europe. Mirman had become the 188th richest person in Britain, and its youngest millionaire.O'Sullivan, Jack, Going to the dogs (and other ways to survive a recession), for The Independent, August 21, 1998 They were held up as examples of Britain's new entrepreneurial flair in the 1980s. In November 1987, SockShop (recently renamed as a company to Sock Shop International P.L.C) opened three stores in Manhattan, aiming (as in London) towards walk-by traffic. One of these outlets was at the 42nd Street entrance to Grand Central Station, the same principle as behind the first British store's placement. = Administration = A couple of years later, when recession struck, Mirman and Ross discovered that their equity (worth ¬£50 million in 1988) had become valueless, and they were overwhelmed by debts. In 1990, they entered administration and BDO Binder Hamlyn took over. 58 shops, including 17 US outlets (14 in New York alone) were closed down, and discussions were entered with interested parties to try to get new funding capital for financing expansion in Europe.Butler, Sarah, Sock Shop Looks for New Capital in Drapers, January 20, 1990 Despite the closures, the administrators recommended Mirman be retained in a key role, praising her business acumen.Sophie Mirman May Play Key Role In Sock Shop Rescue Package, Drapers, June 2, 1990 In August 1990 the business, 85 shops, and the French subsidiary were purchased for ¬£3.25 million (plus an injection of ¬£3.75 million working capital) by a consortium backed by a Scottish fund manager, Murray Johnstone. The company was renamed SockShop Holdings. Unsecured creditors and shareholders in SockShop International received no money from the sale. The chairman for Murray Johnstone Developments, Fred Dalgarno, blamed the expense of the US operation and over-expansion for Sock Shop's problems. Having shed the burden of their debts, it was planned that SockShop Holdings be expanded more cautiously.Butler, Sarah, Sock Shop's Future Plans Revealed Following Consortium Acquisition in Drapers, August 11, 1990 SockShop Holdings fell back into the administrator's hands a second time after becoming part of the Facia Group, a retail conglomerate of 850 shops and 80,000 employees that collapsed in 1996 with debts of ¬£70m due to the fraudulent actions of its owner, Stephen Hinchliffe.Tycoon jailed after \\"lenient\\" sentence BBC News Online, 16 July 2003 It was subsequently acquired by the Tulchan Group. In 2003, SockShop (by then reduced to 13 stores across the UK) was bought for ¬£3.9 million by the Birmingham-based firm of Harris Watson Holdings. The firm collapsed a third time in 2006. The administrators, Poppleton & Appleby, were brought in on 25 January 2006 to try and salvage the dramatically reduced company. This third collapse was attributed to substantial losses as a result of a slowdown in consumer spending and a rise in running costs.Butler, Sarah, Buyer sought for Sock Shop as it collapses for third time in The Times January 26, 2006 In February 2006 following administration it was bought by Osan Ltd which is a subsidiary of Ruia Group.  Ruia Group (2006-present)  Following the 2006 purchase, SOCKSHOP has become primarily an internet retailer, and is based at Dove Mill in Bolton. = Online Shop = The online store, www.sockshop.co.uk, houses SOCKSHOP's largest collection which includes socks, tights, hosiery, underwear and accessories from more than 90 brands - among them Falke, Pantherella, Calvin Klein, Sloggi, Happy Socks and Stance, as well as several of their own brands including Pringle, ELLE, Heat Holders, Glenmuir, Jeep, Workforce and Wild Feet.

Manchester Arndale  In 2015, SOCKSHOP opened a store in the Manchester Arndale shopping centre in Manchester city centre. Located on the ground floor of the centre, the store sells a range of products from SOCKSHOP's own brands. = Charity Work =  Socks for a Cause  In 2018, SOCKSHOP launched its Socks For A Cause campaign, donating 20,000 pairs of socks to various homeless charities in an effort to combat the growing problem of trenchfoot among the homeless, and to help tackle the homelessness problem in Greater Manchester. SOCKSHOP continues to donate socks, underwear and accessories to homeless charities across the country.  Pride Socks  SOCKSHOP designed and launched a range of Pride socks in 2017, donating 20% from the sale of each pair sold to the LGBT Foundation - a Manchester- based charity which provides help and support for members of the LGBT+ community.

Born into a family of a major art historian and Hermitage Museum curator Andrey Ivanovich Somov, he became interested in 18th-century art and music at an early age. Biography = Early life = Konstantin Somov. A portrait taken at the \\"Miracle\\" photo studio in St. Petersburg. 1910s Konstantin Somov painting portrait of Boris Snezhkovsky with Boris standing behind in 1930 Konstantin Somov was born on November 30, 1869 in St. Petersburg in the family of an art historian, famous museum figure, curator of the Hermitage Museum Andrei Somov. Konstantin was the second son in the family. His mother, Nadezhda Konstantinovna, who came from the noble family of the Lobanovs was a good musician and a well-educated person. She instilled in her children a love of theater, music and painting. In addition, the Somovs' house had a huge private collection of old prints, paintings and drawings. Painting and art were a constant subject of conversation and an integral part of their lives and young Konstantin dreamed of becoming an artist from a very young age. For the first time Alexandre Benois met with Somov in the private gymnasium of Karl May. Dmitry Filosofov also studied there, and Somov found a common language and even became friends with him. Benoit in his memoirs says that their manner of sticking together, but apart from everyone else, but for some reason attracted Benoit himself. Later, Dmitry Filosofov was sent to Italy due to illness, and Somov, who had a hard time studying science, was taken from the gymnasium by his father. At the age of 20, Konstantin Somov entered the Imperial Academy of Arts. He studied their under Ilya Repin from 1888 to 1897. While in academy, Benois introduced him to Sergei Diaghilev and L√©on Bakst. When the three founded the World of Art, Somov liberally contributed to its periodicals. Studying in the academy is not easy for Somov, but in 1897 he successfully completed it and moved to Paris to continue his education at the legendary Acad√©mie Colarossi. Inspired by Watteau and Fragonard, he preferred to work with watercolours and gouache. For three years he worked upon his masterpiece, Lady in Blue, painted in the manner of 18th- century portraitists. The artist's first serious success came a year before graduation from the Academy. Somov and Benois spent the summer of 1896 at their dacha near Oranienbaum, in the village of Martyshkino. The landscapes and sketches he brought from there were highly praised by critics and colleagues from the academic environment. In the same summer, he creates illustrations for the works of Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann. During the 1910s, Somov executed a number of rococo harlequin scenes and illustrations to the poems by Alexander Blok. Many of his works were exhibited abroad, especially in Germany, where the first monograph on him was published in 1909. =After the revolution = Somov, like many of his contemporaries, greeted the revolution in Russia with enthusiasm. But living conditions gradually deteriorated: at first, his apartment was nationalized, and at the end the artist was completely evicted from it. Only by a miracle he managed to defend the rights to his own works. In December 1923, Konstantin Somov, together with the Russian Exhibition, went to the United States as an authorized representative of Petrograd. In the USA, he becomes close to the family of Sergei Rachmaninoff and paints portraits of the composer and his daughter. He never returned to his homeland, forever remaining in France. Somov found Soviet Russia \\"absolutely alien to his art\\" and moved to Paris. There, a community of Russian √©migr√© artists had developed by this time. Somov found inspiration in \\"world of artists\\" living in Paris - his old friend Benoit, Bakst and Serebryakova. = Private life = Somov was homosexual, like many of the World of Art members. In the last years of his studies, Somov who was already a well-known artist, led a very reclusive lifestyle. Judging by the letters from that period, loneliness was a burden for him. In the winter of 1899, Somov wrote to his friend and colleague Liza Zvantseva: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I still have no romance with anyone - flirting is, perhaps, very light. But I'm tired of being without romance - it's time, otherwise life goes away and youth, and it becomes scary. I am terribly sorry that my character is heavy, boring, gloomy. I would like to be cheerful, light, so that everything is knee-deep, amorous and rip-off. Only such people have fun, interesting and not scared to live!\\". Model Methodiy Lukyanov became his closest person. They meet in 1910, a forty-year-old artist and an eighteen-year-old Lukyanov. Methodiy settled with the Somovs, where he quickly became part of the family. They lived together and he helped Somov to run the household, organize exhibitions. He was also his art advisor and critic of works. In 1918, Somov painted a large portrait of Lukyanov, sitting on the sofa in pajamas and a dressing gown. This portrait can be seen in the Russian Museum. Somov called him \\"Myth\\". The artist and the model will be together until the death of Methodiy in Paris from tuberculosis. Myth fell ill in the spring of 1931, and his illness shocked Somov. In letters to his sister in Russia, he writes: ‚ÄúEvery minute of my life is now torment - although I do everything I need to - eat, talk with visitors, even work a little - the thought of Methodius and the upcoming separation does not leave me. Now I absorb into myself his face, his every word, knowing that soon I will not see him again \\"...\\" Yesterday, lying on a mattress, on the floor by his bed, I tried to pray mentally - it's me! God, if you exist and care about people, prove, save Methodius to me, and I will believe in you! \\" But it's all in vain. The last, dying words of Methodius, addressed to Somov, were: \\"Kostya ... goodbye.\\" In about 1930, Somov met Boris Mikhailovich Snejkovsky (born 23 July 1910), \\"the twenty-year old young man who would inspire several of Somov's best later works. He would sit for straightforward portrait drawings, beautiful, mildly suggestive oil paintings, and he may have been the model for more erotic watercolors. The exact nature of his relationship with his model and friend is unknown.\\" Somov was buried in the Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery to the south of Paris.  Legacy  On June 14, 2007, Somov's landscape \\"The Rainbow\\" (1927) was sold at Christie's for US$7.33 million, a record for a work at an auction of Russian art. Somov's diary (Dnevik) for the years 1917-1925 was published in Russian by Dmitrii Sechin (Moscow) in 2017 and 2018; the two volumes total over 1600 pages. Works File:A.K. Benois by K.

Regelation is the phenomenon of melting under pressure and refreezing when the pressure is reduced. We can demonstrate regelation by looping a fine wire around a block of ice, with a heavy weight attached to it. The pressure exerted on the ice slowly melts it locally, permitting the wire to pass through the entire block. The wire's track will refill as soon as pressure is relieved, so the ice block will remain solid even after wire passes completely through. This experiment is possible for ice at ‚àí10 ¬∞C or cooler, and while essentially valid, the details of the process by which the wire passes through the ice are complex. The phenomenon works best with high thermal conductivity materials such as copper, since latent heat of fusion from the top side needs to be transferred to the lower side to supply latent heat of melting. In short, the phenomenon in which ice converts to liquid due to applied pressure and then re-converts to ice once the pressure is removed is called regelation. Regelation was discovered by Michael Faraday. It occurs only for substances such as ice, that have the property of expanding upon freezing, for the melting points of those substances decrease with the increasing external pressure. The melting point of ice falls by 0.0072 ¬∞C for each additional atm of pressure applied. For example, a pressure of 500 atmospheres is needed for ice to melt at ‚àí4 ¬∞C.Glossary of Meteorology: Regelation , American Meteorological Society, 2000 Surface melting Melting curve of ice Molecular structure of ice near the surface For a normal crystalline ice far below its melting point, there will be some relaxation of the atoms near the surface. Simulations of ice near to its melting point show that there is significant melting of the surface layers rather than a symmetric relaxation of atom positions. Nuclear magnetic resonance provided evidence for a liquid layer on the surface of ice. In 1998, using atomic force microscopy, Astrid D√∂ppenschmidt and Hans-J√ºrgen Butt measured the thickness of the liquid-like layer on ice to be roughly 32 nm at ‚àí1 ¬∞C, and 11 nm at ‚àí10 ¬∞C. The surface melting can account for the following: *Low coefficient of friction of ice, as experienced by skaters. *Ease of compaction of ice *High adhesion of ice surfaces  Examples of regelation  A glacier can exert a sufficient amount of pressure on its lower surface to lower the melting point of its ice. The melting of the ice at the glacier's base allows it to move from a higher elevation to a lower elevation. Liquid water may flow from the base of a glacier at lower elevations when the temperature of the air is above the freezing point of water.  Misconceptions  Ice skating is given as an example of regelation; however the pressure required is much greater than the weight of a skater. Additionally, regelation does not explain how one can ice skate at sub-zero (¬∞C) temperatures.White, James. The Physics Teacher, 30, 495 (1992). Compaction and creation of snow balls is another example from old texts. Again the pressure required is far greater than can be applied by hand. A counter example is that cars do not melt snow as they run over it.  Latest progress  A supersolid skin that is elastic, hydrophobic, thermally more stable covers both water and ice. The skins of water and ice are characterized by an identical H-O stretching phonons of 3450 cm^-1. Neither the case of liquid forms on ice nor ice layer covers water, but the supersolid skin slipperizes ice and toughens the water skin Hydrogen bond (O:H-O) relaxation under compression. Compression shortens and stiffens the O:H nonbond and simultaneously lengthens and softens the H-O covalent bond, and negative pressure effect oppositely Melting point is proportional to the cohesive energy of the covalent bond. Therefore, compression lower the Tm.  Further reading  *Y. Huang, X. Zhang, Z. Ma, Y. Zhou, W. Zheng, J. Zhou, and C.Q. Sun, Hydrogen-bond relaxation dynamics: resolving mysteries of water ice.

His novels have been translated into 21 languages, the translation of Ways of Dying into Turkish being the latest. Literary works Mda's first novel, Ways of Dying, takes place during the transitional years that marked South Africa's transformation into a democratic nation. It follows the character of Toloki. After finding himself destitute, he invents a profession as a \\"Professional Mourner.\\" He traverses the violent urban landscape of an unnamed South African city, finding an old love amidst the internecine fighting present in the townships and squatter settlements. The Heart of Redness, Mda's third novel, is inspired by the history of Nongqawuse, a Xhosa prophetess whose prophecies catalyzed the Cattle Killing of 1856‚Äì1857. Xhosa culture split between Believers and Unbelievers, adding to existing social strain, famine and social breakdown. It is believed that 20,000 people died of starvation during that time. In the novel, Mda continually shifts back and forth between the present day and the time of Nongqawuse to show the complex interplay between history and myth. He dramatizes the uncertain future of a culture whose troubled relationship with the colonizing force of Empire, as well as their own civil factions, threatens to extinguish their home of Qolorha-by-Sea. Mda's account of the Cattle Killing draws heavily on that of historian Jeff Peires in his book The Dead Will Arise (Mda acknowledges this at the outset of his novel). Like Peires, Mda identifies Mhlkaza, Nongqawuse's uncle and one of the key players in the event, with William Goliath, the first Xhosa person baptised in the Anglican church.

He was also a prominent coach in both sports and a journalist. A small, nuggety man with broad shoulders, pink complexion and intense brown eyes, Worrall was one of Australia's great all-round sports people of the nineteenth century, and was involved in Australian football and cricket at the elite level for many decades. After his retirement, he coached both sports, and is considered the \\"father\\" of Australian football coaching. Worrall had an extended career as a sporting journalist, and he was a highly respected member of the press box right up until his death in 1937. He was no stranger to conflict, and his forthright manner embroiled him in a number of sporting controversies throughout his lifetime. Early life Born on the Victorian Goldfields at Chinaman's Flat (now in the locality of Snake Valley near Maryborough, Worrall was the seventh child of Irish-born parents, Joseph and Ann. He attended state school in Maryborough, but moved to Ballarat in his early twenties. There, he came under notice playing cricket against the touring English team, which led to his selection for Victoria in 1883. Joining the South Ballarat Football Club, Worrall showed excellent potential and he was persuaded to move to Melbourne and play for the fledgling Fitzroy club in 1884. At this stage, Fitzroy had just secured admission to the game's elite competition, the Victorian Football Association (VFA). Worrall became a major factor in the emergence of Fitzroy as a powerful team. During summer, he turned out for the Fitzroy Cricket Club. On Saturday, 27 September 1884, Worrall was playing a cricket match at Albert Park. The Fitzroy Football Club, short of a man, prevailed upon Worrall to play in their team in the match against South Melbourne in Fitzroy's last match for 1884 (Worrall's first season with that club). Worrall played the entire match for Fitzroy, in his \\"white flannels\\"!Fitzroy Football Club: Silver Jubilee, Fitzroy City Press, (Friday, 18 September 1908), p.3; Sporting Intelligence: Football: South Melbourne v. Fitzroy, The Argus, (Monday, 29 September 1884), p.7. The move to Fitzroy dramatically improved Worrall's prospects in both sports. He played his first Ashes test match in the 1884‚Äì1885 season, when he was called into the team at the last minute to replace a player who was in financial dispute over his proposed fee for the game. At this time in his career, Worrall was a middle-order bat who bowled medium pace. He failed to secure a regular place in the test team, and was not always a regular selection for the Victorian team. Champion Footballer and Test Match Success Worrall's football showed more consistency than his cricket. Already captain of the team, Worrall played as a rover. He was skilled, fearless, could kick with either foot and was an excellent overhead mark for his size. Regularly selected for the Victorian team, he is one of very few men to have represented Victoria at both sports. Football was put on hold the following winter when he was chosen to tour England with the Australian cricket team. 300px Along with most of his teammates, Worrall struggled during the wet English summer and failed to enhance his reputation. On his return to Melbourne, he was named The Argus Player of the Year in 1890,The Argus, 29 September 1890 and Fitzroy's key player during these years. Injury got the better of him in 1892, and he retired from football, which allowed him to concentrate on the summer game. The next year, he married Agnes McCullum in Fitzroy. He switched allegiance to the Carlton Cricket Club and in 1896 scored an Australian- record 417 not out for the Blues in a match with University. He reorganised his style, becoming a more aggressive batsman who often opened but no longer bowled. In addition, he was inspirational in the field and his leadership qualities were recognised with the Victorian captaincy sixteen times. A number of big innings for the state kept him in contention for higher honours. This late blooming of his talent culminated in selection for the 1899 tour of England, during which he turned 38. Partnering the legendary Victor Trumper at the top of the order for all five tests, Worrall had his greatest day in the Headingley test match when he scored 76 on a sticky wicket to set up an Australian victory. However, his advanced age meant that this was his last test series, although he continued with Victoria until 1902, when he was 40. In 140 first class matches, he scored 4660 runs at 20.99, took 105 wickets at 23.10, held 101 catches and scored seven centuries. The First Coach Carlton, one of the power clubs of the 1870s and 1880s - the earliest years of elite Australian football - had fallen into a state of decline in 1892, with player dissatisfaction and internal dissent causing an exodus of key players, predominately to Fitzroy and Collingwood. This culminated in the wooden spoon in 1894, and the club perennially finished second last from 1895 to 1901, being a chopping block alongside St Kilda in the early years of competition in the VFL (which began in 1897). In 1902, Worrall, secretary of the Carlton Cricket Club, was appointed to the same role with the football club. Hitherto, Australian footballers were prepared in an ad hoc way commensurate with the organisation of the game as a semi-professional sport where official payments were outlawed, but made surreptitiously. Worrall immediately set about leading training sessions, instructing players, formulating tactics and recruiting talent in a manner that created the role of club coach that is recognised today. For a number of years, he was often referred to as the club's \\"manager\\" or \\"secretary\\", until the term \\"coach\\" passed into common usage. Carlton's rapid improvement and subsequent rise to power encouraged other VFL clubs to appoint a coach, and these men used Worrall as their role model. The Blues climbed the ladder quickly, making the finals in 1903-04-05 without winning the flag. Worrall's old club Fitzroy were the benchmark of the competition at this point, and eliminated Carlton from the finals in 1905 after beating them in the 1904 Grand Final. Worrall continually turned over players in an effort to find the right combination for success. Eventually, he developed a big, strong team that favoured long kicking and liked to close up the game, forming packs and using their physical strength in the crushes. Fitness was a priority for Worrall: he ensured that his team trained harder than the opposition. Finally, in 1906, Carlton defeated Fitzroy in the Grand Final by a record 49 points, a record margin, with a young team that seemed to have the footballing world at its feet winning the club's first premiership since 1887. This success was followed up by winning the next two premierships, the first hat- trick of premierships by a club in the VFL. The 1908 performance was the highlight of Worrall's coaching career: The Blues lost only one game (by 13 points, on a very muddy ground and in driving rain against Essendon at the EMCG) for the year (a record equalled but never beaten subsequently in VFL/AFL history), while the team's 19-1 season record remained the best across a VFL/AFL season (equalled in 1929 and 1950) until 2000. Inevitable tensions arose, however, as the players were receiving only a 30 shillings ($3) per week, yet were training to a professional standard. Adding to the players' dissatisfaction was the increased money coming into the game, as Carlton's revenue had doubled since the time of Worrall's appointment. Worrall's sometimes brusque approach to dealing with individuals, and his puritanical attitude to alcohol only served to exacerbate the situation. Early in 1909, Carlton had a players revolt over money and Worrall's disciplinary demands, with seven players refusing to take the field in the opening round match against University - a team in their second VFL season whose players were all amateurs. Despite having five of their key players unavailable, University beat Carlton by 15 points in a stunning upset, keeping Carlton goalless in the first half of the match. The matter continued on for a number of weeks, with a small group of players holding out and threatening to leave unless Worrall gave his resignation, which he did on July 29. He continued on as secretary, but resigned that position at the end of the season when the disharmony was still not repaired. A number of players who supported the ex-coach left Princes Park in sympathy. After a season as the VFL umpires' coach, Worrall was recruited by Essendon. Here, he took a talented but previously under- performing team to a premiership in his first season and in 1912, led an injury-ravaged Essendon team to an upset hot favourites South Melbourne in the Grand Final. Over five completed seasons, Worrall coached five premiership teams. But Essendon declined rapidly thereafter and went into recess in 1916‚Äì1917 due to World War I. Performances failed to improve when the Same Old returned to competition, winning only fifteen out of 46 games between 1918 and 1920, prompting Worrall's retirement. As the team finished last in 1918, Worrall became the first man to coach both a premiership and a wooden spooner. In 1922, he reappeared briefly as an assistant to Vic Belcher at his old team, Fitzroy, which went on to win the premiership from Collingwood. Journalism and other achievements Worrall was a driving force behind the creation of the Australian Football Council (AFC) in 1905. Formed as the peak body of Australian football, the organisation initially took control of the rules of the game and organised the first interstate carnival between the Australian states and New Zealand in 1908. Worrall was elected as one of the Victorian delegates. In 1909, the Victorian Cricket Association (VCA) made Worrall coach of the state's colts team, which played at district level and was designed to develop young talent. Beginning his journalism career with the Sydney Referee after his retirement from playing cricket, Worrall expanded his involvement in the press during Essendon's hiatus from the VFL in 1916. He joined The Australasian, and wrote on both sports. John Ritchie, in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, described his writing thus: In the 1930s, he was the senior man in the press box, and many attribute the coining of the phrase \\"Bodyline\\" (describing the English bowling tactics on their 1932‚Äì1933 Australian tour) to Worrall. He died in the Melbourne suburb of Fairfield, early in the 1937‚Äì1938 cricket season, survived by his wife; the couple had one child, a daughter, Doris Lilian. The flags at the MCG, the scene of so many of his sporting triumphs, flew at half mast during a Sheffield shield match in honour of Worrall. His funeral at Heidelberg attracted a massive crowd of former footballers, cricketers, journalists and administrators. In 1996 Worrall's outstanding contributions to the game of Australian rules football were recognised when he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame as a player. Controversies *In 1892, he was caught up in a dispute with the Fitzroy Cricket Club, and eventually left to play with Carlton. *In 1902, he wrote an article about the questionable bowling actions of two Australian players on tour in England. The VCA banned Worrall from playing for Victoria for the rest of the season in response. *During the 1904 pre-season, Worrall was sacked as Carlton coach when irregulariies regarding the funds of the Carlton Football Club came to light. After an investigation, Worrall was exonerated of wrongdoing and reinstated. *In 1909, a Carlton player revolt over training conditions and wages led to his resignation as Carlton's coach.

She joined the Religion Department of Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, US, in 1993. Biography Born in Kaduna to Igbo parents, Ife Amadiume was educated in Nigeria before moving to Britain in 1971. She studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, gaining a BA (1978) and PhD (1983) in social anthropology respectively. She was a research fellow for a year at the University of Nigeria, Enugu, and taught and lectured in the UK, Canada, US and Senegal.Margaret Busby (ed.), \\"Ifi Amadiume\\", in Daughters of Africa (Cape, 1992), pp. 632‚Äì637. Her fieldwork in Africa resulted in two ethnographic monographs relating to the Igbo: African Matriarchal Foundations (1987), and the award-winning Male Daughters, Female Husband (Zed Press, 1987). The latter is considered groundbreaking owing to the fact that more than a decade before the articulation of queer theory, it argued that gender, as constructed in Western feminist discourse, did not exist in Africa before the colonial imposition of a dichotomous understanding of sexual difference.Male Daughters, Female Husbands at The University of Chicago Press. Her book of theoretical essays, Reinventing Africa, appeared in 1998. Extracts from her work is included in the anthology Daughters of Africa (1992). As a poet she participated in Festac '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, and her 1985 collection, Passion Waves, was nominated for the Commonwealth Poetry Prize. She won the Flora Nwapa Society Award for her 2006 book of poetry, Circles of Love.Peter Welsh, \\"Full circle: Amadiume wins Flora Nwapa Society Award for new book\\", Vox (Dartmouth College), '05-'06 Academic Year, May 29 Issue.

The organisation aims to promote the values of democracy, peace and human rights in Africa, particularly in the West African sub-region. The Centre was established to mobilise global opinion and resources for democratic development and provide an independent space to reflect critically on the challenges posed to the democratization and development processes in West Africa, and also to provide alternatives and best practices to the sustenance of democracy and development in the region. History The CDD was founded in 1997 in London at a time when Nigeria was under military rule. Its first activity was to organize a roundtable discussion on the future of democracy in Nigeria. One of the founding members was Biko Agozino, a criminologist whose books explored the impact of colonization on the way racial and ethnic minorities are treated by justice systems worldwide. The Center works on policy-oriented scholarship on introducing and improving democratic processes, improving economic governance, safety and development throughout Africa.The Centre remains focused on capacity building work, policy analysis and advocacy, and as a research reference point on democratic governance, human security and people-centred development in the region. It has remained a critical bridge building institution between policy makers, civil society activists and academics in West Africa. Activities CDD has offices in Lagos, Abuja, and Maiduguri in Nigeria, and an international office in London. The center conducts research on democratization and good governance, and also trains groups and individuals who are promoting democracy and development in the region. In collaboration with the Kituo Cha Katiba (East African Centre for Constitutional Development) the CDD has run a capacity building project funded by the Ford Foundation. The project sponsors East African Women Lawyers for Graduate Masters Programs, particularly those who want to use the law as an instrument of social change. Promoting democratic accountability through election campaign promises monitoring Buharimeter project, supported by the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), was a tool designed to track over 222 election pledges made by President Muhammadu Buhari, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to Nigerians before the 2015 general elections. Sequel to the release of One Year Assessment report, its key findings were referenced in numerous opinion pieces and articles authored by political commentators and scholars. For example, in July 2016, Emmanuel Ugwu, in his article titled ‚ÄòWhy Buhari Must Watch Buharimeter ‚Äô, drew the attention of President Buhari to the importance of Buharimeter as a tool for objective assessment of its administration. According to him: ‚ÄòBuhari ought to face the mirror of his campaign promises every day of his finite tenure. He should respect the Buharimeter as the reflection of his vows and accomplishments. This will furnish him with the right perspective he needs to secure a befitting legacy.‚Äô Buharimeter's one-year report did provide a synopsis of citizens‚Äô perception on the implications of the actions of the government and also revealed the degree to which Nigerians were aware of campaign promises and the actions carried out to achieve them. Knowledge about existence of the Buharimeter and its findings have taken a global outlook. Aside from highlighting how the initiative was widely reported internationally, Buharimeter is now listed as one of the promise tracking initiatives on the Duke Reporters' Lab. The one year report was the fifth report released since the launch of the project. Others include 30 days, 60 days, 100 days, 7 months‚Äô and mid-term assessment reports published in July 2017, and can be viewed on Buharimeter reports. By May 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari will be 3 years in office, the Buharimeter team at the Centre for Democracy and Development is expected to release a third-year report which should score the performance of Nigeria's President after 3 years. Work on Boko Haram insurgence CDD is one of the first organizations to commence work on addressing the crisis in the North East. The Centre organised the first intervention that brought Borno residents, government and civil society together at the height of the insurgency in 2011. Since then it has organised several fora, developed counter radical narratives,developing a transitional justice framework supports the Operation Safe Corridor (OSC) program of the Nigerian Government on Deradicalisation, Rehabilitation of former Boko Haram militants and has a MOU with the Presidential Committee on the North East Initiative.

It is home to more than 100,000 inhabitants. In the past a village called \\"Militari\\" existed here, but today there are only few houses left from that time. The earliest housing scheme comprises small-semi detchaced houses, which have been built in the 1950s by Communist party workers; with the first tower blocks being built in 1966‚Äì1967. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, most of the present-day blocks of flats (with 8 and 10 floors) were built. Amongst the well known apartment buildings are the B22 Block, built from 1977 to 1979 by Yugoslav architects, the 15-storey tower blocks at Lujerului (right next to the so-called Serbian block, also designed by Yugoslav architects, completed in 1974), and the OD16 block, initially built sometime between 1972 and 1975, but fully collapsed during the 1977 Vrancea earthquake due to substandard construction practices (it was eventually rebuilt in 1978). The neighborhood features a few markets, including Gorjului, Lujerului, and Apusului (similar markets are found in most communist-era housing estates, such as the SƒÉlƒÉjan market in Titan, as well as the Moghioro»ô and Orizont markets in Drumul Taberei). The district is very compact and it was built using a basic three parallel boulevards-geometry. Militari is packed between Drumul Taberei and Cr√¢nga»ôi districts, and it is one of the westernmost neighborhoods of Bucharest. It is served by the Bucharest Metro, buses, trolleybuses and tramways which connect it with the city center and the Gara de Nord railway station. Because of its access to the A1 motorway, the district developed rapidly following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, transforming itself in one of the most prosperous neighborhoods of Bucharest. In recent years the district saw the opening of two hypermarkets (Cora and Carrefour) and a large mall (\\"Plaza Romania\\"). The district has a new theatre (\\"Masca\\") and a modern cinema (\\"Movieplex\\").

A port to MS-DOS also appeared in the same year, followed by a version for the NEC PC-9801 in 1993. A sequel, titled Inferno, was released in 1994 for PCs only. Gameplay Epic is an action-based space flight simulator game. It features eight completely different levels (including two in two phases), which take place either in space or over the surface of a planet. Each has a tight time limit to complete the mission (destroying the assigned targets); failure results in the loss of one of the player's ships and may affect the gameplay in subsequent missions. Plot The plot borrowed heavily from the television series Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek and the Star Wars film franchise, focusing on a fleet of ships carrying the human inhabitants of a planet threatened by an imminent supernova. The escape route leads through the Rexxon Empire's territory, however the Rexxons doubt the human's motives and refuse safe passage. With no other option, the humans are forced to attempt a crossing, leading to war between the two. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent to the Rexxon scientists monitoring the human's sun that the exodus is indeed genuine. However, the Rexxon military suppresses the knowledge and doubles down on their efforts to stop the human's fleet, deepening the conflict. The player controls the fleet's only hope, one of three experimental Epic class fighters. In the final mission, the fighter is also used to deploy a cobalt bomb. Development The game had been in development for about three years and had been repeatedly delayed. At first it was known under the working title Goldrunner 3D and was initially announced to be published by Microdeal as a spiritual sequel to the two Uridium-like Goldrunner top-down shooting games, before a publishing deal was signed with Ocean in 1989. Much of the technology that was used to create F29 Retaliator had been used to create Epic. The action is viewed in 3D, with graphics being a mix of uniformly-coloured polygons and bitmaps (featuring 16 colours for Atari ST and 32 colours in the Amiga version, largely shades of grey). Cut-scenes that move the story along vary between the versions; the Atari ST and Amiga versions are largely the same, a combination of pre-rendered 3D artwork overlaid with dynamically generated ships and more conventional artwork where characters are involved. On the Atari ST, some pre-rendered images have been dropped and replaced with similar, animated bitmap versions of the same scene. The PC release, which unlike the Amiga and Atari ST versions was only ever intended to be installed and run from a hard disk, has enhanced cut-scenes reflecting the extra resources available to the developers. Other graphics are more detailed, including the Epic fighter's cockpit and the in-game 3D ship models have been changed subtly. The Rexxon fighters, for example, are less angular. In game music for both the Atari ST and PC features Mars, the Bringer of War and the Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity from The Planets by Gustav Holst, the Atari ST rendition being composed of samples. The Amiga received a new composition. The game's box art was provided by Bob Wakelin, in one of his last commissions from Ocean. While approved by the publisher's management, it was not liked by the developers, one of whom Wakelin later alleged, had given him his brief when intoxicated. The look of the pilot was based on both Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson. Release Epic was released by Ocean in the Spring of 1992 on home computer formats at a price of ¬£25.99 in the UK. Some releases included a bonus anaglyphic 3D poster of the game's box art, complete with branded glasses. According to Amiga Power, the initial release version of Epic had a fatal glitch that caused the game to crash, leading to many returns of the game. Later that year, it was included as the lead pack-in title by Commodore UK for their Amiga 600 focussed Epic bundle, alongside Rome: Pathway to Power and Myth: History in the Making, squarely aimed at the Christmas buying market. Unlike the retail release, this version could only be installed on and run from the Amiga 600's hard disk. Subsequently, the game received a budget re-release in 1994 on Ocean's Hit Squad label. In December 2019 the PC version of the game was re-released digitally, bundled with its sequel Inferno. Reception Critical reception of Epic was mixed. A number of magazines scored the game highly including the review scores of 92% for the PC version from Mega Zone, 91% from CU Amiga and Amiga User International, and 90% from Amiga Action. ACE, for instance, gave the Amiga and ST versions a score of 839 (out of a possible 1000), praising its fast 3D graphics and sense of scale, but disliking its longevity and lack of depth. In ST Format, the game received a score of 91% and was described as \\"the best blaster that the ST has seen in some time\\". The title fared less well with Amiga Power which gave the game 34%, noting its many glitches, and accused more positive reviews from months earlier of basing their reviews on an unfinished demo build of the game. Amiga Power further criticised Epic's time limits, concluding that the game feels \\"rushed\\" and \\"unfinished\\", and prioritised looks over gameplay. Maff Evans in Amiga Format delivered a similar verdict and criticism, also awarding a score of 34%, noting that the despite being two years late, the game felt rushed to release and expressed that the game was too short. The magazine also published feedback from players in the review, many of whom also completed the game shortly after purchase, complaining that a cheat mode for the game was included in the instructions. With such a long gestation, the game was previewed to magazines long before release. The result was that some magazines included comments about features and shortcomings that were not present in the game that finally made it to the retailers. For example, CU Amiga referred to the Amiga version's music being from The Planets, although in the final release this was not the case. Amiga Power's review went as far as criticising other magazines for reviewing an incomplete game and by extension, misleading their readership. > \\"Other reviews which you may have read in other magazines - usually glowing, > we might add - which appeared up to six or seven months ago were based on > fairly early demo versions, and are thus completely invalid. We'll say it > now and say it loud - reviewing unfinished games does the reader no service > at all, and if you suspect a magazine of doing so, and there are a lot which > are guilty in this instance, you should either make their lives hell or > simply stop buying their mag.\\" On re-release, all magazines marked the game down, with Amiga Power providing a renewed rating of 30%, commenting that the game had not improved with age. CU Amiga was more generous in its scoring, awarding the title 70%, but less so in its comments highlighting the game's lack of depth, although the reviewer did mention that it played much better on the faster Amiga 1200, which was not released at the time the game first appeared. Expansion pack An expansion pack for the game, Epic Extra Missions, was included on the cover disk for issue 47 of The One which was only issued for the game on the Amiga. The magazine suggested that other packs would be made available for the game, however there was no commercial release.

Under a false identity as Teodoro B. Castro, a wealthy Costa Rican expatriate living in Rome, Grigulevich served as the ambassador of the Republic of Costa Rica to both Italy and Yugoslavia (1952‚Äì1954). His mission as an agent was to assassinate Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito but was later aborted by Stalin's death in 1953. Grigulevich then settled in Moscow, where he worked as an expert on the history of Latin America and on the Roman Catholic Church. He was a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, served as editor-in-chief of the magazine Obshchestvennye nauki i sovremennost (\\"Social Sciences Today\\"), and published many books and articles about Latin American subjects. Early life Grigulevich was born in Vilnius, Russian Empire (present day Lithuania), to a family of Crimean Karaites. His parents emigrated to Argentina when he was young. His father did well for himself and later sent Iosif to Europe to study. However, some sources claim that only his father moved to La Clarita, Argentina and he and his mother remained in Trakai, Lithuania, where he joined the Polish Communist Party and became acquainted with Edward Gierek, not travelling to Argentina until 1934. In any case, in 1933, he studied briefly at the Sorbonne. He was recruited by the NKVD and showed a gift for languages, soon picking up English, Spanish, French and Russian. Secret agent In the late 1930s, Grigulevich was sent to Spain to monitor the activities of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM, the militia with which George Orwell served), during the course of the civil war in that country. Grigulevich worked under NKVD general Alexander Orlov, using the code names MAKS and FELIPE, and organized so-called \\"mobile groups\\" that killed, among other actual and suspected Trotskyists, POUM leader Andr√©s Nin. In this mission Grigulevich apparently collaborated with the assassin Vittorio Vidali, known in Spain as \\"Comandante Carlos Contreras.\\"Thomas Hugh, The Spanish Civil War, revised edition (Harper & Row, New York, 1997) . Grigulevich was summoned back to Moscow in 1938. In January 1940 he was sent to Mexico, under the code name \\"Yuzek,\\" to take part in the first attempt on the life of Leon Trotsky, again with Agent Vidali. In the wee hours of May 24, 1940, a group of peasants and miners, led by Grigulevich and David Siqueiros, stormed Trotsky's compound at Coyoacan near Mexico City. In terms of harm, they missed Trotsky and his wife altogether and managed only to wound their young grandson in the foot. (Defector Walter Krivitsky managed to hear of this attempt and sent a warning to Trotsky through Dies Committee member J.B. Matthews. Trotsky acknowledged the warning. In a letter, he responded, \\"Krivitsky is right. We are the two men the OGPU is sworn to kill.\\" ) After the failed attempt to assassinate Trotsky, Grigulevich and two of his accomplices (Laura Araujo Aguilar and Antonio Pujol Jimenez) were helped by Pablo Neruda to escape from the Mexican police. Later, Grigulevich was sent to Argentina under the code name \\"Artur\\", where he remained during World War II and organized anti-Nazi sabotage operations. He married a Mexican woman named Laura Araujo Aguilar, who was also a Soviet secret agent, operating under the code name LUIZA.Christopher M.

Castro (right), on April 27, 1953.Prijem Teodora Kastra, poslanika Kostarike. foto.mij.rs Ambassador Castro was in fact a Soviet illegal agent, Iosif Grigulevich, who, under orders from Stalin and the NKVD, was plotting to assassinate Tito. In 1949, with the help of Joaqu√≠n Guti√©rrez, a Costa Rican writer who harboured very pro-Soviet and Communist sympathies and who worked in his country's diplomatic corps, Grigulevich procured a false passport identifying him as Teodoro Castro Bonnefil, and settled in Rome.Marjorie Ross, El discreto encanto de la KGB: las cinco vidas de I√≥sif Griguli√©vich, (Farben/Norma, San Jos√©, Costa Rica, 2004) . Grigulevich pretended to be the illegitimate son of a wealthy Costa Rican coffee producer and styled himself Teodoro B. Castro (using a middle initial in the \\"American manner\\"). He successfully established an import- export business in Rome and made extensive personal contacts with business figures and prelates of the Catholic church. He also became a friend and business partner of former Costa Rican president Jos√© Figueres and in 1951 \\"Teodoro B. Castro\\" was appointed as charg√© d'affaires of the Costa Rican embassy in Rome, serving also as advisor to the Costa Rican delegation to the sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, in Paris. In 1952, he was appointed as ambassador to both Italy and Yugoslavia. In the meantime, Grigulevich was secretly granted Soviet citizenship and membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In early 1952, the Soviet intelligence services assigned Grigulevich the task of conducting the assassination of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, who had broken with Stalin in 1948 over his insistence in maintaining Yugoslav independence from Soviet control (see Tito‚ÄìStalin split). In his role as the Costa Rican ambassador (he presented his credentials on April 25, 1953Kolektivna predaja akreditiva diplomatskih predstavnika u Beogradu: grupna fotografija. foto.mij.rs), Grigulevich met with Tito on several occasions, but the death of Stalin in March 1953 interrupted the assassination plans and Grigulevich was eventually summoned back to Moscow, marking the end of his career as a Soviet secret agent. In Rome, the sudden disappearance of the Costa Rican ambassador, along with his wife and daughter, created a stir, with rumors of Mafia involvement circulating in diplomatic circles. Historian In Moscow, Grigulevich settled into a new life as an academic. He was awarded a doctorate in history without having to defend a thesis and worked as an expert on Latin America and the Catholic Church. He was the author of 58 books, some of which were published under the pseudonym Iosif Lavretzky (–õ–∞–≤—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π). In 1976 he wrote a biography of Che Guevara. In 1979 he became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Colleagues were puzzled by the lack of any biographical information about him prior to his forties and by his refusal to be photographed. The details of Grigulevich's role as a Soviet agent were clarified only after the fall of the communist regime, particularly with the release of the so-called \\"Mitrokhin archive\\" in the mid-1990s.

He is noted for his introduction of the term Eurocentrism in 1988 and considered a pioneer of Dependency Theory. Biography Amin was born in Cairo, the son of an Egyptian father and a French mother (both medical doctors). He spent his childhood and youth in Port Said; there he attended a French high school, leaving in 1947 with a Baccalaur√©at. It was at high school that Amin was first politicized when, during the Second World War, Egyptian students were split between communists and nationalists; Amin belonged to the former group. By then Amin had already adopted a resolute stance against fascism and Nazism. While the upheaval against British domination in Egypt informed his politics, he rejected the idea that the enemy of their enemy, Nazi Germany, was the Egyptians' friend. In 1947 Amin left for Paris where he obtained a second high school diploma with a specialization in elementary mathematics from the prestigious Lyc√©e Henri IV. He gained a diploma in political science at Sciences Po (1952) before graduating in statistics at INSEE (1956) and also in economics (1957). In his autobiography Itin√©raire intellectuel (1990) he wrote that in order to spend a substantial amount of time in \\"militant action\\" he could devote only a minimum to preparing for his university exams. The intellectual and the political struggle remained inseparable for Amin all throughout his life. Rather than explaining the world and its atrocities he meant to highlight and to be part of struggles aimed at changing the world. After arriving in Paris, Amin joined the French Communist Party (PCF), but he later distanced himself from Soviet Marxism and associated himself for some time with Maoist circles. With other students he published a magazine entitled √âtudiants Anticolonialistes. His ideas and political position were also strongly influenced by the 1955 Asian‚ÄìAfrican Bandung Conference and the nationalization of the Suez Canal. The latter even encouraged him to postpone his PhD thesis that was ready in June 1956 to take part in the political unrest. In 1957 he presented his thesis, supervised by Fran√ßois Perroux among others, originally titled The origins of underdevelopment - capitalist accumulation on a world scale but retitled The structural effects of the international integration of precapitalist economies. A theoretical study of the mechanism which creates so-called underdeveloped economies. After finishing his thesis, Amin went back to Cairo, where he worked from 1957 to 1960 as a research officer for the government's \\"Institution for Economic Management\\" where he worked on ensuring the state‚Äôs representation on the boards of directors of public sector companies while at the same time immersing himself in the very tense political climate linked to the nationalization of the Canal, the 1956 war and the establishment of the Non- Aligned Movement. His participation in the Communist Party that was clandestine at the time made for very difficult working conditions. In 1960 Amin left for Paris where he worked for six months for the Department of Economic and Financial Studies - Service des √âtudes √âconomiques et Financi√®res (SEEF). Subsequently, Amin left France, to become an adviser to the Ministry of Planning in Bamako (Mali) under the presidency of Modibo Ke√Øta. He held that position from 1960 to 1963 working with prominent French economists such as Jean B√©nard and Charles Bettelheim. With some scepticism Amin witnessed the growing emphasis on maximizing growth in order to ‚Äúclose the gap‚Äù. Although he abandoned working as a ‚Äòbureaucrat‚Äô after he left Mali, Samir Amin continued to act as an adviser for several governments, such as China, Vietnam, Algeria, Venezuela, and Bolivia. In 1963 he was offered a fellowship at the Institut Africain de D√©veloppement √âconomique et de Planification (IDEP). Within the IDEP Amin created several institutions that eventually became independent entities. Among them one that later became the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA), conceived on the model of the Latin American Council for Social Sciences (CLACSO). Until 1970 he worked there as well as being a professor at the University of Poitiers, Dakar and Paris (of Paris VIII, Vincennes). In 1970 he became director of the IDEP, which he managed until 1980. In 1980 Amin left the IDEP and became a director of the Third World Forum in Dakar. In Amin's life and thinking the three activities have been closely connected: work in economic management, teaching/ research, and the political struggle. ‚ÄúSamir Amin has been one of the most important and influential intellectuals of the Third World‚Äù. Amin's theoretical pioneering role has been often overlooked because his thesis of 1957 was not published until 1970 in extended book form under the title L‚Äôaccumulation √† l‚Äô√©chelle mondiale (Accumulation at the global level). Amin lived in Dakar until the end of July 2018. On July 31st he was, diagnosed with lung cancer, transferred to a hospital in Paris. Amin died on August 12th at the age of 86.  Political Theory and Strategy  Samir Amin is considered a pioneer of Dependency Theory and World System Theory, while he preferred to call himself part of the school of Global Historical Materialism (see 2.1), together with Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy. His key idea, presented as early as 1957 in his Ph.D. dissertation, was that so-called ‚Äòunder-developed‚Äô economies should not be considered as independent units but as building blocks of a capitalist world economy. In this world economy, the ‚Äòpoor‚Äô nations form the ‚Äòperiphery‚Äô, forced to a permanent structural adjustment with respect to the reproduction dynamics of the ‚Äòcentres‚Äô of the world economy, that is, of the advanced capitalist industrial countries. Around the same time and with similar basic assumptions the so-called desarrollismo (CEPAL, Raul Prebisch) emerged in Latin America, which was developed further a decade later in the discussion on ‚Äòdependencia‚Äô ‚Äì and even later appeared Wallerstein‚Äôs ‚Äòworld system analysis‚Äô. Samir Amin applied Marxism to a global level, using terms as ‚Äòlaw of worldwide value‚Äô and ‚Äòsuper-exploitation‚Äô to analyse the world-economy (see 2.1.1). At the same time his critique extended also to Soviet Marxism and its development program of ‚Äòcatching up and overtaking‚Äô. Amin believed the countries of the ‚Äòperiphery‚Äô would not be able to catch up in the context of a capitalist world-economy, because of the system‚Äôs inherent polarization and certain monopolies held by the imperialist countries of the ‚Äòcenter‚Äô (see 2.1.2). Thus, he called for the ‚Äòperiphery‚Äô to ‚Äòdelink‚Äô from the world economy, creating ‚Äòautocentric‚Äô development (see 2.2) and rejecting the ‚ÄòEurocentrism‚Äô inherent to Modernisation Theory (see 2.3). = Global historical materialism = Resorting to the analyses of Marx, Polanyi and Braudel, the central starting point of Samir Amin‚Äôs theories is a fundamental critique of capitalism, at the centre of which is the conflict structure of the world system. Amin states three fundamental contradictions of capitalist ideology: 1. The requirements of profitability stand against the striving of the working people to determine their own fate (rights of workers as well as democracy were enforced against capitalist logic); 2. The short-term rational economic calculus stands against long-term safeguarding of the future (ecology debate); 3. The expansive dynamics of capitalism lead to polarizing spatial structures - the Center-Periphery Model. According to Amin, capitalism and its evolution can only be understood as a single integrated global system, composed of ‚Äòdeveloped countries‚Äô, which constitute the Center, and of ‚Äòunderdeveloped countries‚Äô, which are the Peripheries of the system. Development and underdevelopment consequently constitute both facets of the unique expansion of global capitalism. Underdeveloped countries should not be considered as ‚Äòlagging behind‚Äô because of the specific - social, cultural, or even geographic - characteristics of these so-called ‚Äòpoor‚Äô countries. Underdevelopment is actually only the result of the forced permanent structural adjustment of these countries to the needs of the accumulation benefiting the system‚Äôs Center countries. Amin identifies himself as being a part of the school of global historical materialism, in contrast to the two other strands of dependency theory, the so-called dependencia and the World Systems Theory. The dependencia school is a Latin American school associated with e. g. Ruy Mauro Marini, Theot√¥nio dos Santos, and Ra√∫l Prebisch. Prominent figures of the World Systems Theory are Immanuel Wallerstein and Giovanni Arrighi. While they use a widely similar scientific vocabulary, Amin rejected f.e. the notion of a semi-periphery and was against the theorization of capitalism as cyclical (as by Nikolai Kondratjew) or any kind of retrojection., thus holding a minority position among the World System theorists. For Amin, the school of global historical materialism was Marxism understood as a global system. Within this framework, the Marxist law of value is central (see 2.1.1). Nevertheless, he insisted that the economic laws of capitalism, summed up by the law of value, are subordinate to the laws of historical materialism. In Amins understanding of these terms that is to say: economic science, while indispensable, cannot explain the full reality. Mainly because it cannot account either for the historical origins of the system itself, nor for outcomes of class struggle. ‚ÄúHistory is not ruled by the infallible unfolding of the law of pure economy. It is created by the societal reactions to these tendencies that express themselves in these laws and that determine the social conditions in whose framework these laws operate. The ‚Äòanti-systemic‚Äô forces impact and also influence real history as does the pure logic of the capitalist accumulation.‚Äù (Samir Amin)  Law of worldwide value  Amins theory of a global law of value describes a system of unequal exchange, in which the difference in the wages between labor forces in different nations is greater than the difference between their productivities. Amin talks of ‚Äúimperial rents‚Äù accruing to the global corporations in the Center - elsewhere referred to as ‚Äúglobal labor arbitrage‚Äù. Reasons are, according to Amin, that while free trade and relatively open borders allow multinationals to move to where they can find the cheapest labour, governments keep promoting the interests of ‚Äòtheir‚Äô corporations over those of other countries and restricting the mobility of labor. Accordingly, the periphery is not really connected to global labour markets, accumulation there is stagnant and wages stay low. In contrast, in the centres accumulation is cumulative and wages increase in accordance with rising productivity. This situation is perpetuated by the existence of a massive global reserve army located primarily in the periphery, while at the same time these countries are more structurally dependent, and their governments tend to oppress social movements which would win increased wages. This global dynamic Amin calls ‚Äûdevelopment of underdevelopment‚Äú. The aforementioned existence of a lower rate of exploitation of labor in the North and a higher rate of exploitation of labor in the South is further thought to constitute one of the main obstacles to the unity of the international working class. According to Amin the ‚ÄúGlobal Law of Value‚Äù thus creates the ‚Äúsuper-exploitation‚Äù of the periphery. Further, the core countries keep monopolies on technology, control of financial flows, military power, ideological and media production, and access to natural resources (see 2.1.2).  Imperialism and Monopoly Capitalism  The system of worldwide value as described above means, that there is one imperial world system, encompassing both the global North and the global South. Amin further believed that capitalism and imperialism were linked at all stages of their development (as opposed to Lenin, who argued that imperialism was a specific stage in the development of capitalism). Amin defined Imperialism as: ‚Äúprecisely the amalgamation of the requirements and laws for the reproduction of capital; the social, national and international alliances that underlie them; and the political strategies employed by these alliances‚Äù (Samir Amin) According to Amin, capitalism and imperialism reach from the conquest of the Americas during the sixteenth century to today‚Äôs phase of what he referred to as ‚Äúmonopoly capitalism‚Äù. Further the polarization between Center and Peripheries is a phenomenon inherent in historical capitalism. Resorting to Arrighi, Amin differentiates the following mechanism of polarization: 1. Capital flight takes place from the periphery to the centre; 2. selective migration of workers is heading in the same direction; 3. Monopoly situation of the central companies in the global division of labour, in particular the technology monopoly and the monopoly of global finances; 4. Control of centres on access to natural resources. The forms of the Center-Peripheries polarization, as well as the forms of expression of imperialism, have changed over time - but always towards an aggravation of the polarization and not towards its mitigation. Historically, Amin differentiated three phases: Mercantilism (1500-1800), Expansion (1800-1880) and Monopoly Capitalism (1880-today). Amin adds that the current phase is dominated by generalized, financialized, and globalized oligopolies located primarily in the triad of USA, Europe, and Japan. They practice a sort of collective imperialism by means of military, economic and financial tools such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The triad enjoys the monopoly of five advantages: weapons of mass destruction; mass communication systems; monetary and financial systems; technologies; and access to natural resources. It wishes to keep these at any cost and thus has engaged in the militarization of the world in order to avoid losing these monopolies. Amin further differentiated the existence of two historical phases of the development of monopoly capitalism: proper monopoly capitalism up to 1971, and oligopoly- finance capitalism after that. The Financialization and ‚Äúdeepened globalization‚Äù of the latter he considered a strategic response to Stagnation. Stagnation he considered as the rule and rapid economic growth as the exception under late capitalism. According to him, the rapid growth of 1945‚Äì1975 was mainly the product of historical conditions brought into being by the Second World War and could not last. The focus on Financialization, which emerged in the late 1970s, to him was a new more potent counter to stagnation ‚Äúinseparable from the survival requirements of the system‚Äù, but eventually leading to the financial crisis 2007-2008. According to Amin, as a result of imperialism and superexploitation, political systems in the south are often distorted towards forms of autocratic rule. To maintain control over the periphery, the imperial powers promote backward-looking social relations drawing on archaic elements. Amin argues for example that political Islam is chiefly a creature of imperialism. The introduction of democracy in the South, without altering the fundamental social relations or challenging imperialism, is nothing but a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù and doubly so given the plutocratic content of the so-called successful democracies in the North. = Delinking = Amin forcefully stated that the emancipation of the so-called ‚Äòunderdeveloped‚Äô countries can neither happen while respecting the logic of the globalized capitalist system nor within this system. The South would not be able to catch up in such a capitalist context, because of the system‚Äôs inherent polarization. This belief led Samir Amin to assign significant importance to the project adopted by the Asian‚ÄìAfrican countries at the Bandoeng (Indonesia) Conference in 1955. Amin called for each country to delink from the world economy meaning to subordinate global relations to domestic development priorities, creating ‚Äòautocentric‚Äô development (but not autarky). Instead of defining value by dominant prices in the world ‚Äì which result from productivity in the rich countries ‚Äì Amin suggested that value in each country should be set so that agricultural and industrial workers are paid by their input into the society‚Äôs net output. Thereby a National Law of Value should be defined without reference to the Global Law of Value of the capitalist system (e.g. food sovereignty instead of free trade, minimum wages instead of international competitiveness, full employment guaranteed by government). The main effect of this move would be to raise wages in agriculture. Amin suggested that national states redistribute resources between sectors, and centralize and distribute the surplus. Full employment should be guaranteed, and the exodus from rural to urban areas discouraged. After the decolonization on a state level, this should lead to economic liberation from neo- colonialism. However, Amin underlined that it is almost impossible to delink 100% and estimated a delinking of 70% already a significant achievement. Relatively stable countries with some military power have more leverage in this regard than small countries. China‚Äôs development for example is, according to Amin, determined 50% by its sovereign project and 50% by globalisation. When asked about Brazil and India, he estimated that their trajectories were driven by 20% sovereign project, and 80% globalisation, while South Africa was determined by 0% sovereign project and 100% globalisation. It was also clear to Amin that such decoupling also requires certain political prerequisites within a country. His country studies, initially limited to Africa, taught him that a national bourgeoisie geared towards a national project, neither existed nor was it emerging. Rather, he observed the emergence of a ‚Äòcomprador bourgeoisie‚Äô, who benefited from the integration of their respective countries into the asymmetrically structured capitalist world market. Regarding the project of an auto-centered new beginning (the decoupling) he hoped instead for social movements, which is why he was committed to numerous non-governmental organizations until the end. = Eurocentrism = Amin proposed a history of civilization in which accidental advantages of the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù led to the development of capitalism first in these societies. This then created a global rift, arising from the aggressive outward expansion of capitalism and colonialism. Amin argues that it is a mistake to view Europe as a historical centre of the world. Only in the capitalist period has Europe been dominant. For Amin, Eurocentrism is not only a worldview but a global project, homogenising the world on a European model under the pretext of ‚Äòcatching-up‚Äô. In practice, however, capitalism does not homogenise but rather polarises the world. Eurocentrism is thus more of an ideal than a real possibility. It also creates problems in reinforcing racism and imperialism. Fascism remains a permanent risk, because to Amin it is an extreme version of Eurocentrism. = Cambodia = Amin was long an influence on and supporter of the leaders of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime, becoming acquainted with the Khmer Rouge's future leaders in post-World War II Paris, where Pol Pot, Khieu Samphan, and other Cambodian students were studying. Khieu Samphan's doctoral thesis, which he finished in 1959, noted collaborations with Amin and claimed to apply Amin's theories to Cambodia. In the late 1970s, Amin praised the Khmer Rouge as superior to Marxist movements in China, Vietnam, or the Soviet Union, and recommended the Khmer Rouge model for Africa. Amin continued to actively praise the Khmer Rouge into the 1980s. At a 1981 talk in Tokyo, Amin praised Pol Pot's work as \\"one of the major successes of the struggle for socialism in our era\\" and as necessary against \\"expansionism\\" from the Soviet Union or from Vietnam. Some scholars, such as Marxist anthropologist Kathleen Gough, have noted that Khmer Rouge activists in Paris in the 1950s already held ideas of eliminating counter- revolutionaries and organizing a party center whose decisions could not be questioned. Despite contemporary reports of mass killings committed by the Khmer Rouge, Amin argued that \\"the cause of the most evil to the people of Kampuchea\\" lay elsewhere: > The humanitarian argument is in the final analysis the argument offered by > all the colonialists... Isn't [the cause of evil] first of all the American > imperialists and Lon Nol? Isn't it today the Vietnamese army and their > project of colonizing Kampuchea? =Views on world order= Samir Amin expressed view on world order and international relations: ‚ÄúYes, I do want to see the construction of a multipolar world, and that obviously means the defeat of Washington‚Äôs hegemonic project for military control of the planet.‚ÄùSamir Amin, Beyond US Hegemony? Assessing the Prospects for a Multipolar World, (Beirut: World Book Publishing, 2006), p 17. In 2006, he stated: He also stated: Hence, Europe must end its ‚ÄúAtlanticist option‚Äù and take the course of the ‚ÄúEurasian rapprochement‚Äù with Russia, China, India and the rest of Asia and Africa. This ‚ÄúEurasian rapprochement‚Äù is necessary for the head-on collision with the United States.Beyond US Hegemony, p 148-149. =Views on political Islam= According to Samir Amin, political Islam leads its struggle on the terrain of culture, wherein \\"culture\\" is intended as \\"belongingness to one religion\\". Islamist militants are not actually interested in the discussion of dogmas which form religion, but on the contrary are concerned about the ritual assertion of membership in the community. Such a world view is therefore not only distressing, as it conceals an immense poverty of thought, but it also justifies Imperialism's strategy of substituting a \\"conflict of cultures\\" for a conflict between the liberal, imperialist centres and the backward, dominated peripheries. This importance attributed to culture allows political Islam to obscure from every sphere of life the realistic social dichotomy between the working classes and the global capitalist system which oppresses and exploits them.page 83, \\"The World We Wish To See; Revolutionary Objectives In The Twenty-First Century\\", Samir Amin and James Membrez, , , , Publishing Date: Jul 2008, Publisher: Monthly Review Press The militants of political Islam are only present in areas of conflict in order to furnish people with education and health care, through schools and health clinics. However, these are nothing more than works of charity and means of indoctrination, insofar as they are not means of support for the working class struggle against the system which is responsible for its misery. Besides, beyond being reactionary on definite matters (see the status of women in Islam) and responsible for fanatical excesses against non-Muslim citizen (such as the Copts in Egypt), political Islam even defends the sacred character of property and legitimises inequality and all the prerequisites of capitalist reproduction. One example is the Muslim Brotherhood's support in the Egyptian parliament for conservative and reactionary laws which empowers the rights of property owners, to the detriment of the small peasantry. Political Islam has also always found consent in the bourgeoisie of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, as the latter abandoned an anti-imperialist perspective and substituted it for an anti-western stance, which only creates an acceptable impasse of cultures and therefore doesn't represent any obstacle to the developing imperialist control over the world system. Hence, political Islam aligns itself in general with capitalism and imperialism, without providing the working classes with an effective and non-reactionary method of struggle against their exploitation.page 84, \\"The World We Wish To See; Revolutionary Objectives In The Twenty-First Century\\", Samir Amin and James Membrez, , , , Publishing Date: Jul 2008, Publisher: Monthly Review Press It is important to note, however, that Amin was careful to distinguish his analysis of political Islam from islamophobia, thus remaining sensitive to the anti-Muslim attitudes that currently affect Western Society.

The Ga and Dangbe people are grouped respectively as part of the Ga‚ÄìDangme ethnolinguistic group. The Ga-Dangmes are one ethnic group that lives primarily in the Greater Accra of Ghana. Ethnic Ga family names (surnames) such as Tagoe, Dodoo, Lartey, Nortey, Nai, Aryee, Poku, Lamptey, Tetteh, Armah, Ankrah, Tetteyfio, Laryea, Ayitey, Okai, Bortey, Quaye, Quaynor, Ashong, Kotei, Ako, Sowah, Odoi, Ashong, Ablor and Adjetey Under their great leader King Ayi Kushi (Cush) (1483-1519) they were led from the east in several states before reaching their destination in Accra. Oral traditions state the Ga came from the region of Lake Chad and reached their destination in the 16th century. It is also believed that by the 17th century they traveled down the River Niger and crossed the Volta to reach present day Ghana. This leader is the Moses of the Ga-Dangme people, with his seven (7) puritan laws he gave them and that has formed the basis and philosophy of the state, making the state a friendly state recognised by all in respect to making Greater Accra Region the capital of the then Gold Coast in 1877. The Ga people were organized into six independent towns (Accra (Ga Mashie), Osu, La, Teshie, Nungua, and Tema). Each town had a stool, which served as the central object of Ga ritual and war magic. Accra became the most prominent Ga-Dangme towns and is now the heartbeat and capital of Ghana.Ga  people . Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2015-12-19. The Ga people were originally farmers, but today fishing and trading in imported goods are the principal occupations. Trading is generally in the hands of women, and a husband has no control over his wife's money. Succession to most offices held by women and inheritance of women's property are by matrilineal descent. Inheritance of other property and succession to male-held public offices are by patrilineal descent. Men of the lineage live together in a men's compound, while women, even after marriage, live with their mothers and children in a women's compound. Each Ga town has a number of different cults and many gods, and there are a number of annual town festivals. The Dangme people occupy the coastal area of Ghana from Kpone to Ada, on the Volta River and South Atlantic Ocean along the Gulf of Guinea and inland along the Volta River. The Dangme People include the Ada, Kpone, Krobo, Ningo, Osudoku, Prampram, and Shai, all speaking Dangbe of the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo family of languages.Adangme  people . Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2015-12-19. The Dangme People have the largest Population among the two related Ga-Dangme People. About 70% of the Greater Accra Regional Land is owned by the Dangmes located in Dangme East and Dangme West Districts of Ghana. Also, in the Eastern Region and Volta Region of Ghana, about 15% of lands belong to the Dangme People. These are mainly in the Manya Krobo and Yilo Krobo Districts of the Eastern Region. In the Agotime Area of Volta Region and the Dangme Area in the Southern part of Togo. Dangme occupations are fishing, trading and farming which is based on the huza system. In this system a tract of land is acquired by a group of people, usually members of an extended family; the land is subdivided among them according to the amount each has paid, and each individual thereafter has complete control of his own section. Negotiations with the seller are carried out by an elected huzatse (‚Äúfather of the huza‚Äù), who later acts as the huza leader and representative. Millet was formerly the staple food, but more common crops now include cassava, yams, corn (maize), plantain, cocoa, and palm oil. Lineage members generally return to the traditional lineage home from the huza farms several times a year to participate in the festivals of their lineage gods. There are also many annual festivals. The Ga-Dangme are organized into clans based on patrilineal descent; the clans are subdivided into localized patrilineages, the basic units of the Ga-Dangme historical, political, cultural tribal group. Language Linguistically, the Ga-Dangbe speak the Kwa languages Ga and Dangme and are a patrilineal people. Dangme is exclusively closer to the original Ga‚ÄìDangme languages than the Ga language. Arts and culture The Ga people celebrate the Homowo festival, which literally means \\"hooting at hunger.\\" This festival originated several centuries ago. It is celebrated in remembrance of a great famine that hit the Ga people in the sixteenth century. It is mainly a food festival which celebrates the passing of that terrible period in Ga history. It takes place in August every year and is celebrated by all the Ga clans. The Dangbe people from Ada celebrate the Asafotu festival, which is also called 'Asafotufiam', an annual warrior's festival celebrated by Ada people from the last Thursday of July to the first weekend of August. It commemorates the victories of the warriors in battle and is a memorial for those who fell on the battlefield. To re-enact these historic events, the warriors dress in traditional battle dress and stage a mock battle. This is also a time for male rites of passage, when young men are introduced to warfare. The festival also coincides with the harvest cycle, when these special customs and ceremonies are performed. These include purification ceremonies. The celebration reaches its climax with a durbar of chiefs, a colourful procession of the Chiefs in palanquins with their retinue. They are accompanied by traditional military groups called 'Asafo Companies' amidst drumming, singing and dancing through the streets and on the durbar grounds. At the durbar, greetings are exchanged between the chiefs, libations are poured and declarations of allegiance are made. The Dangbe people from Odumase - Krobo also Celebrate the [Ngmayem] festival, An Annual Harvest festival to Celebrate the bounty harvest of their farmers is celebrated by the Krobo people throughout the last week (Seven days) of October with a visit to their famous Ancestral home, the Krobo Mountains [Kloyom] on the last Friday of October with a climax on the Saturday with a grand Durbar of Chiefs and People of the Krobo Traditional Area. the [Konor] who is the Paramount Chief sits in state as the overlord together with his sub-chiefs, Government officials, other traditional Authorities and Invited guests. =Music and sports= The Ga-Dangbe music includes drumming and dancing. One of their traditional music and dance styles (albeit a fairly modern one) is kpanlogo, a modernized traditional dance and music form developed around 1960. Yacub Addy, Obo Addy, and Mustapha Tettey Addy are Ga drummers who have achieved international fame. Music of the Ga-Dangbe people also include [Klama], [Kpatsa] and the Dipo dance all of the Krobo people. In addition to music, the Ga-Dangbe people are known for their long history and successes in the sport of boxing. The fishing community of Bukom on the outskirts of Accra, is considered as the mecca of boxing in Ghana and has produced several notable boxers. It is the home of many famous boxing \\"clubs\\" and gymnasiums. Notable fighters include David Kotei aka DK Poison, Alfred Kotey, Joshua \\"The Hitter\\" Clottey, and former WBA Welterweight champion boxer Ike \\"Bazooka\\" Quartey, and former multi-weight class champion Azumah \\"Zoom Zoom\\" Nelson aka Prof. =Rites of passage= For the Shai and Krobo people, the Dipo is the formal rite of passage. Originally designed as a formal marriage training for mature women in their twenties, Dipo has evolved into a pre-marital sexual purification rite that involves teenage girls conducting traditional religious rituals and putting on dance performances for the public. Initiates are partially nude throughout much of the ritual. In addition, they are each adorned with custom-made glass beads, colorful loin cloths, and various forms of woven headgear. According researcher and author Priscilla Akua Boakye, \\"[Dipo] was a form of vocational training for young women in which they were taught generally how to assume their roles as responsible women.\\" Despite the ritual being designated for older teenaged girls, it is not uncommon for young pre-adolescent and even toddler aged girls to take part. = Funerals and \\"fantasy\\" coffins = The Ga people are known for their funeral celebrations and processions. The Ga believe that when someone dies, they move to another life. Therefore, special coffins are often crafted by highly skilled carpenters since this tradition spread in the 1950s. Pioneers were master craftsmen like Ataa Oko (1919-2012) from La, and Seth Kane Kwei (1925-1992) from Teshie. The coffins can be anything wanted by relatives of the deceased from a pencil to any animal such as an elephant. Coffins are usually crafted to reflect an essence of the deceased, in forms such as a character trait, an occupation, or a symbol of one's standing in the community. National Museum of Funeral History . Retrieved 20 September 07 For example, a taxicab driver is most likely to be buried in a coffin shaped as a car. Many families spend excessive amounts on coffins because they often feel that they have to pay their last respects to the deceased and being buried in a coffin of cultural, symbolic as well expensive taste is seen as fitting. Prices of coffins can vary depending on what is being ordered. It is not unusual for a single coffin to cost $600. This is expensive for local families considering that it is not unusual to meet people with an income of only $50 a month. This means that funerals are often paid for by wealthier members of the family, if such a member exists, with smaller contributions coming from other working members of the family. This is needed as the coffin is only a portion of the total funeral cost that will be incurred. Some people foreign to Ghana are known to have been buried in Ga-styled coffins.

Photo Regula Tschumi The use of these fantasy coffins is explained by the religious beliefs of the Ga people regarding their afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still living (lucky as they are). This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the size and the success of the burial service and of course the usage of an exclusive coffin. Design coffins are only seen on the day of the burials when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people's professions, the purpose being to help them continue with their earthly profession in the afterlife. Certain shapes, such as a sword or chair coffin, represent royal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various creatures, such as lions, cockerels and crabs represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. Design coffins have been used since around the 1950s, especially in rural Ga groups with traditional beliefs, and have now become an integral part of Ga burial culture. Today, figural coffins are made in several workshops in Togo and Greater Accra. Successful coffinmakers are for example Cedi and Eric Adjetey Anang of Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop, Paa Joe, Daniel Mensah and Kudjoe Affutu. Most of the figural coffins are used for funerals, only a few are exported for international art exhibitions.

It was a unit of The National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa. Its staff of 536 consisted of some of the best prosecutors, police, financial, forensic and intelligence experts in the country. It was officially disbanded late in January 2009 by South African President Kgalema Motlanthe, after coming into conflict with the (then) head of the South African Police Service, Jackie Selebi.  Mission  The Scorpions were officially launched in Gugulethu, in Cape Town on 01 September 1999. They were initially called Directorate of Special Investigations (DSI) and within a few weeks the official name was changed to Directorate of Special Operations (DSO). This Investigating Directorate had the investigative capacity to prioritise and to investigate particularly serious criminal or unlawful conduct committed in an organised fashion, or certain offences or unlawful conduct. Its objective was to prosecute such offences and investigate unlawful conduct in the most efficient and effective manner, such as the crimes committed by the infamous Martin Marais. As a multidisciplinary agency, the Directorate investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption, in order to ensure a safe and secure environment which was conducive to both growth and development. The NPA structure included the National Prosecuting Services (NPS), the Directorate: Special Operations (DSO), the Witness- Protection Programme, the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) and specialised units such as the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit and the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit. The Scorpions was governed by the National Prosecuting Authority Act, 32 of 1998, which provided the Directorate with the necessary investigative powers. The DSO was headed by a Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions, Leonard McCarthy. It had two main Directorates, namely: *Strategic and Investigative Support; and *Operations  The main purpose of the Operations Directorate  Managing and overseeing all functions relating to operations; Authorisation, review, reporting of all investigations and prosecutions; The Directorate of Special Operations is specifically mandated to deal with crimes committed in an organised fashion (high-level crimes of national impact). The DSO has initiated a number of nationally coordinated projects into high-level organised crime. These include investigations into: *trans-national drug trafficking, *human smuggling and trafficking *cross- departmental fraud and corruption in Provincial Government and National Government. *fraud and corruption within the private business sector white- collar crime  Key strategic crime focus areas  The broad legislative mandate of the DSO has been narrowed down to four crime focus areas: *organised crime; *organised corruption; *serious and complex financial crime; and *racketeering and money laundering  Image  In June 1999, president Thabo Mbeki announced that \\"a special and adequately staffed and equipped investigative unit will be established urgently, to deal with all national priority crime, including police corruption\\". In September 1999 The Directorate of Special Operations was set up, with the first director Frank Dutton. Soon, the Scorpions became notorious for their raids of houses of high-ranking politicians within the ANC Party. Following investigations of alleged corruption in case of the South African Arms Deal, raids were commenced at the houses of then Deputy President Jacob Zuma, former Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and Durban businessman Schabir Shaik. After the conviction of Shaik on 8 June 2005, the Scorpions raided his house again on 18 August. This time it was part of a couple of raids in investigation for the corruption trial of Zuma, which started in October 2005. Raids were also conducted at houses of Jacob Zuma himself. These raids were heavily criticised by COSATU, accusing that the NPA and the judicial system are capable of being manipulated and influenced to take biased political decisions and actions. Just a few days before the raids, the COSATU had asked the government to drop charges against former Deputy President Jacob Zuma and to reinstate him. The DSO pioneered a new approach, which combines intelligence, investigation and prosecution. With the DSO's success in high-profile cases, public confidence grew in the Directorate's ability to impact on organised crime. Money laundering and racketeering were added to its priorities and the DSO succeeded in obtaining the first-ever convictions for racketeering in South Africa. By February 2004, the DSO had completed 653 cases, comprising 273 investigations and 380 prosecutions. Of the 380 prosecutions, 349 resulted in convictions, representing an average conviction rate of 93,1%. =Merging with the police= The ANC decided to merge the Scorpions with the SA Police Service following the Khampepe Commission by June 2008, reducing their power. The disbandment was recommended by South Africa's minister of safety and security, Charles Nqakula. The decision was controversial, and was opposed by a majority of South Africanshttp://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Scorpions-not-part-of- police-20080507 and interest groups ranging from opposition parties to organised business. The Democratic Alliance has accused the ANC of merging the Scorpions with the South African Police Service in order to subvert investigations into the SA Police and protect corrupt ANC officials. On 23 October 2008, the South African parliament officially abolished the Scorpions. The vote was 252 in favour with 63 against. Preparations were made for the remaining Scorpions members to start work in the Police's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). This unit is known as the Hawks. Subsequently, the Hawks shut down the probe the Scorpions had been conducting into bribery among Zuma allies in a multibillion-rand arms deal.http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article708651.ece/Hawks-shut-down-arms- deal-probe =Constitutional Court ruling= The South African Constitutional Court ruled that the legislation, which replaced the Scorpions crime fighting unit with the Hawks, was ‚Äúconstitutionally invalid‚Äù. The reason being that the Hawks are ‚Äúvulnerable to political interference.‚Äù This case was brought to trial by a private individual (businessman Hugh Glenister) using his own personal money (ZAR 3.5 million) to fund the case. The money retrieved from the victory is to be placed into a trust for use on similar cases in future. The judges in the matter were: Judge Dikgang Moseneke and Judge Edwin Cameron. They have suspended the effect of the judgement for 18 months to allow time for parliament to take remedial action. In response the South African Parliament passed the SA Police Service Amendment Act, however a Court judgement by the Western Cape High Court again found that the Act does not go far enough to secure independence for the Hawks. Eight years later the Minister for Police, Bheki Cele, announced that the Police Services Act would be reviewed and the independence of the Hawks re-examined.

Operation Trident saw the first use of anti-ship missiles in combat in the region. The operation was conducted on the night of 4‚Äì5 December and inflicted heavy damage on Pakistani vessels and facilities. While India suffered no losses, Pakistan lost a minesweeper, a destroyer, a cargo vessel carrying ammunition, and fuel storage tanks in Karachi. Another destroyer was also badly damaged and eventually scrapped. India celebrates its Navy Day annually on 4 December to mark this operation. Trident was followed up by Operation Python three days later. Background In 1971, the Port of Karachi housed the headquarters of the Pakistan Navy and almost its entire fleet was based in Karachi Harbour. Since Karachi was also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan's economy. The security of Karachi Harbour was predominant to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes. The port's airspace was secured by the strike aircraft based at airfields in the area. Towards the end of 1971, there were rising tensions between India and Pakistan, and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s in the vicinity of Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also be operating in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a demarcation line which ships in their fleet would not cross. Later this deployment proved to be useful for gaining experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began. Operation =Prelude= The Indian Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Delhi, along with the Western Naval Command, planned to attack the Port of Karachi. A strike group under Western Naval Command was formed for this mission. This strike group was to be based around the three Vidyut-class missile boats already deployed off the coast of Okha. However, these boats had limited operational and radar range and to overcome this difficulty, it was decided to assign support vessels to the group. On 4 December, what was now designated as the Karachi Strike Group was formed and consisted of the three Vidyut-class missile boats: , and , each armed with four Soviet made SS-N-2B Styx surface-to-surface missiles with a range of , two anti-submarine corvettes: and , and a fleet tanker, . The group was under the command of Commander Babru Bhan Yadav, the commanding officer of the 25th Missile Boat Squadron. =Attack= As planned, on 4 December, the strike group reached (nmi) south off the coast of Karachi, and maintained its position during the day, outside the surveillance range of the Pakistan Air Force. As Pakistani aircraft did not possess night-bombing capabilities, it was planned that the attack would take place between dusk and dawn. At 10.30 pm Pakistan Standard Time (PKT), the Indian task group moved from its position towards the south of Karachi. Soon Pakistani targets, identified as warships, were detected to the northwest and northeast of the Indian warships. INS Nirghat drove forward in a northwesterly direction and fired its first Styx missile at , a Pakistani . Khaibar, assuming it was a missile from Indian aircraft, engaged its anti-aircraft systems. The missile hit the right side of the ship, exploding below the galley in the electrician's mess deck at 10.45 pm (PKT). This led to an explosion in the first boiler room. Subsequently, the ship lost propulsion, and was flooded with smoke. An emergency signal that read: \\"Enemy aircraft attacked in position 020 FF 20. No. 1 boiler hit. Ship stopped\\", was sent to Pakistan Naval Headquarters (PNHQ). Due to the chaos created by the explosion, the signal contained the wrong coordinates of the ship's position. This delayed rescue teams from reaching its location. Observing that the ship was still afloat, Nirghat fired its second missile hitting Khaibar in the second boiler room on the ship's starboard side, eventually sinking the ship and killing 222 sailors. A PNS destroyer, Shah Jahan, shown here in the service of the British Royal Navy when it was known as HMS Charity, was badly damaged by Styx missiles fired by INS Nipat on 4 December 1971 After verifying two targets in the area northwest of Karachi, at 11.00 pm (PKT), INS Nipat fired two Styx missiles ‚Äì one each at cargo vessel MV Venus Challenger and its escort , a destroyer. Venus Challenger, carrying ammunition for the Pakistani forces, exploded immediately after the missile hit, and eventually sank south of Karachi. The other missile targeted Shah Jahan and damaged the ship very badly. At 11.20 pm (PKT), , an , was targeted by INS Veer. A missile was fired and Muhafiz was struck on the left side, behind the bridge. It sank immediately before it could send a signal to the PNHQ, killing 33 sailors. Meanwhile, INS Nipat continued towards Karachi and targeted the Kemari oil storage tanks, placing itself south of the Karachi harbour. Two missiles were launched; one misfired, but the other hit the oil tanks, which burned and were destroyed completely, causing a Pakistani fuel shortage. The task force returned to the nearest Indian ports. Soon the PNHQ deployed rescue teams on patrol vessels to recover the survivors of Khaibar. As Muhafiz sank before it could transmit a distress call, the Pakistanis only learned of its fate from its few survivors who were recovered when a patrol vessel steered towards the ship's burning flotsam. Aftermath The Pakistan Air Force retaliated for these attacks by bombing Okha Port, scoring direct hits on fuelling facilities for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and the missile boats' jetty. The Indian Navy anticipated this attack and had already moved the missile boats to other locations to prevent any losses. However, the destruction of a special fuel tank prevented any further incursions until Operation Python, executed three days later. As a result of the operation, all of the Pakistan Armed Forces were put on high alert. The deployments raised a number of false alarms in the ensuing days about the presence of Indian Navy vessels off Karachi. One such false alarm was raised by a Pakistan Navy Fokker Friendship reconnaissance aircraft on 6 December 1971, which incorrectly reported a frigate of the Pakistan Navy as an Indian Navy missile boat. The PNHQ requested a Pakistan Air Force air strike on the supposed Indian ship. At 06.45 am (PKT), fighter jets were scrambled and strafed the vessel before it was identified as the frigate . This friendly fire incident resulted in casualties and damage to the vessel. With no casualties on the Indian side, this operation was considered to be one of the most successful in modern naval history post-World War II. To mark this victory, the Indian Navy annually celebrates Navy Day on 4 December. =Awards= A number of Indian Navy personnel were honoured with gallantry awards for the operation. Then Fleet Operations Officer, Captain (later Vice Admiral) Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani, was awarded the Nau Sena Medal for the detailed operational planning; the Maha Vir Chakra was awarded to the strike group commander, Cdr Babru Bhan Yadav, for planning and leading the task force; and Vir Chakras were awarded to Lieutenant Commanders Bahadur Nariman Kavina, Inderjit Sharma, and Om Prakash Mehta, the commanding officers of INS Nipat, INS Nirghat, and INS Veer respectively. Master Chief M. N. Sangal of INS Nirghat was also awarded the Vir Chakra.

He is also an essayist, as well as having written poetry, short stories, and books for children.  Early life and education  Ayi Kwei Armah was born in the port city of Sekondi-Takoradi in Ghana to Fante-speaking parents, descending on his father's side from a royal family in the Ga nation. From 1953 to 1958 Armah attended the Prince of Wales's College (now better known as Achimota School), and won a scholarship to study in the United States, where he was between 1959 and 1963.Siga Fatima Jagne and Pushpa Naidu Parekh (eds), \\"Ayi Kwei Armah (1939‚Äì)\\", in Postcolonial African Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook, Routledge, 1998, p. 45. He attended Groton School in Groton, MA, and after graduating he entered Harvard University, receiving a degree in sociology. He then moved to Algeria and worked as a translator for the magazine R√©volution Africaine. In 1964, he returned to Ghana, where he was a scriptwriter for Ghana Television and later taught English at the Navrongo Secondary School. Between 1967 and 1968, he was editor of Jeune Afrique magazine in Paris. From 1968 to 1970, Armah studied at Columbia University, obtaining his MFA in creative writing. In the 1970s, he worked as a teacher in East Africa, at the College of National Education, Chang'ombe, Tanzania, and at the National University of Lesotho. He subsequently taught at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Cornell University, and at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He has lived in Dakar, Senegal, since the 1980s. In the village of Popenguine, about 70 km from Dakar, he established his own publishing house, Per Ankh: the African Publication Collective,\\"Ayi Kwei Armah (1939‚Äì)\\", Books and Writers. through which his own books are now available.\\"Welcome to Per Ankh Publishers\\". Per Ankh Books.  Publications  Beginning his career as a writer in the 1960s, Armah published poems and short stories in the Ghanaian magazine Okyeame, and in Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, and New African.\\"Biography of Ayi Kwei Armah\\" , African Success. His first novel, The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born, was published in 1968, and tells the story of a nameless man who struggles to reconcile himself with the reality of post-independence Ghana. In Fragments (1970), the protagonist, Baako, is a \\"been-to\\" ‚Äì a man who has been to the United States and received his education there. Back in Ghana he is regarded with superstitious awe as a link to the Western lifestyle. Baako's grandmother Naana, a blind-seer, stands in living contact with the ancestors. Under the strain of the unfulfilled expectations Baako finally breaks. As in his first novel, Armah contrasts the two worlds of materialism and moral values, corruption and dreams, two worlds of integrity and social pressure. Why Are We So Blest? (1972) was set largely in an American university, and focused on a student, Modin Dofu, who has dropped out of Harvard. Disillusioned Modin is torn between independence and Western values. He meets a Portuguese black African named Solo, who has already suffered a mental breakdown, and a white American girl, Aim√©e Reitsch. Solo, the rejected writer, keeps a diary, which is the substance of the novel. Aim√©e's frigidity and devotion to the revolution leads finally to destruction, when Modin is killed in the desert by OAS revolutionaries. The trans-Atlantic and African slave trades are the subject of Armah's Two Thousand Seasons (1973), in which a pluralized communal voice speaks through the history of Africa, its wet and dry seasons, from a period of one thousand years. Arab and European oppressors are portrayed as \\"predators,\\" \\"destroyers,\\" and \\"zombies\\". The novel is written in allegorical tone, and shifts from autobiographical and realistic details to philosophical pondering, prophesying a new age. The Healers (1979) mixed fact and fiction about the fall of the Ashanti Empire. The healers in question are traditional medicine practitioners who see fragmentation as the lethal disease of Africa. Armah remained silent as a novelist for a long period until 1995, when he published Osiris Rising, depicting a radical educational reform group that reinstates ancient Egypt at the centre of its curriculum. Belonging to the generation of African writers after Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka, Armah has been said to \\"epitomize an era of intense despair.\\"Robert Fraser, The Novels of Ayi Kwei Armah, Heinemann, 1980. Armah's later work in particular has evoked strong reaction from many critics. While Two Thousand Seasons has been called dull and verbose, or the product of a \\"philosophy of paranoia, an anti-racist racism ‚Äì in short, Negritude reborn\\"Bernth Lindfors, in Derek Wright (ed.), Critical Perspectives on Ayi Kwei Armah, 1992, p. 271. Soyinka has written that Armah's vision \\"frees itself of borrowed philosophies in its search for unifying, harmonizing ideal for a distinctive humanity.\\"Wole Soyinka, Myth, Literature and the African World, 1976, p. 110. As an essayist, Armah has dealt with the identity and predicament of Africa. His main concern is for the creation of a pan-African agency that will embrace all the diverse cultures and languages of the continent. Armah has called for the adoption of Kiswahili as the continental language.

He was the mayor elect of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the 2005 Ethiopian general elections. He is a founding chairman of the Rainbow Ethiopia: Movement for Democracy and Social Justice and a Deputy Chairman of Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), for whom he served as chief election campaign strategist. He is also the co-founder and Leader of Ginbot 7, an anti-government rebel group. Until mid-2018, He was labelled a terrorist by the Ethiopian government.  Early life  Berhanu was born in Bishoftu, the son of Ato Nega Bonger, a prominent businessman, and Woizero Abebech Woldegiorgis, the second-eldest of 12 children. He attended Addis Ababa University where he participated in the student movement against the ruling Derg government in his freshman year.Prairienet entry on Berhanu Nega When the government acted against political dissidents in 1977, Berhanu with other radical student activists fled to Mount Asimba in northern Ethiopia. After a division within the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP), he was detained for openly criticizing killings within the EPRP. After a few months, he was released by his captors and crossed into the Sudan where he lived for two years until he was granted political asylum in the United States. He did his undergraduate degree in economics at the State University of New York at New Paltz and got his PhD in economics from the New School for Social Research, in New York City. During that time, he became one of the organizers of an annual conference on the \\"Horn of Africa\\" that debated and analyzed the political, social and economic conditions in the sub-region. For over five years, it served as a forum for intellectual dialogue among political leaders, policy analysts and researchers interested in developments in that part of Africa. Having completed his PhD studies, he joined the faculty of economics at Bucknell University, where he became a lecturer in economics for three years. Later he founded Imbilta, a bi-monthly magazine focusing on economic, political, social and current affairs in Ethiopia and he was the founding chairman of Ethiopian Economic Association.  Return to Ethiopia  Berhanu, with his wife and his two children, Noah and Iyassu, returned to Ethiopia in 1994. Berhanu became an entrepreneur and founded the Ethiopian Agro-Maize, a fertilizer-producing company, and Addis Village Family Home Builders. Berhanu has also served as a lecturer at the Addis Ababa University, Department of Economics. From 1996 to 2000, he served as the president of the Ethiopian Economic Association. He has also served as the head of the Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute, a non-profit organization that he helped to establish. He also did consulting work for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. On 8 April 2001 Berhanu and Professor Mesfin Woldemariam held a day-long panel discussion at the hall of the National Lottery on academic freedom, which was followed by student riot on the main campus of Addis Ababa University. They were arrested on the allegations that this panel incited a student protest at Addis Ababa University the next day, but were released on bail on 5 June, and neither were ever tried.  The 2005 general election  During the 2005 elections, Berhanu debated Meles Zenawi.http://www.mediaethiopia.com Despite the post-election political impasse, CUD members, who had won 137 of the 138 seats on the city council, met on 20 August and elected Berhanu mayor of Addis Ababa. Dr. Admasu Gebeyehu and Assefa Habtewold were elected Deputy Mayor and Speaker of the city assembly respectively at the same meeting. However, the October riots led to Berhanu's imprisonment, along with CUD chairman Hailu Shawul, Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, and Former Senior UN Prosecutor Dr. Yacob Haile-Mariam and other leaders of the CUD, as well as a number of civil rights activists and independent journalists. They were charged with genocide and treason. Amnesty International and the European Union recognized the prisoners as political prisoners and requested immediate and unconditional release.Ethiopia: Prisoners of conscience prepare to face 'trial' , Amnesty International USA website (accessed 20 May 2009) While in Kaliti Prison, Berhanu wrote and published a book Yenetsanet Goh Siked (\\"The Dawn of Freedom\\"), which was published, according to the print on the book, in Kampala, Uganda by MM Publisher May 2006. However the real publishers were a group of young intellectuals in cooperation with Alafa printers that is located in Addis Ababa. The book, over 600 pages long, was highly popular and was sold out in its first weekend, selling out over 10,000 copies and garnering a black market with price 5 times its retail - so much so that the government started harassing people found with the book, stopping traffic and searching cars, while the public was selling copies of the book in black market. More copies were brought in from outside as local publishers were afraid of publishing the book.\\"Dr. Berhanu Nega publishes book from prison\\", Addis Capital (accessed 20 May 2009).  After imprisonment  Berhanu's CUD party won 137 seats of the 138 seats in the Addis Ababa city council. The elected council members of the party held an election for mayor and elected Berhanu to be the mayor. Then, the ruling party refused to hand in the city and eventually imprisoned all the leaders of the party including Berhanu. After 21 months in prison along with all opposition leader, Berhanu left the country in 2007 and returned to teach at the economics department of Bucknell at Bucknell University. While in the U.S, Berhanu announced the founding of a new political group, Ginbot 7, as the old one was dismantled by the government. Ginbot 7, established to pursue civil resistance through an all-inclusive means, attracted thousands of people in Ethiopia and abroad. Ginbot 7 now is one of the prominent opposition organizations fighting for liberty and democracy in Ethiopia.\\"Ginbot 7: Movement for Justice, Freedom and Democracy Is Formed\\", Ginbot 7 website, 14 May 2008 (accessed 20 May 2009). The ruling government claimed on 24 April 2009 that it had foiled a coup attempt led by members of Ginbot 7 to overthrow the government, arresting 35 people they claimed were part of the plot.\\"Woyanne claims it has foiled Ginbot 7 activities in Ethiopia\\", Ethiopian Review 25 April 2009 (accessed 20 May 2009) Those arrested included General Tefera Mamo, Berhanu's cousin Getu Worku, and Tsige Habte-Mariam, the 80-year- old father of another well-known opposition figure at the time in exile, Andargachew Tsige.\\"Ethiopia's regime must reveal fate of political prisoners\\", Ethiopian Review, 5 May 2009 (accessed 20 May 2009). Ginbot 7 has claimed this allegation is part of the government's overall suppression of dissent by accusing its opponents of illegal activities and sentencing them in a kangaroo court. In late 2009 an Ethiopian court sentenced Berhanu to death, in absentia, along with four others (who were also sentenced in absentia), while 33 were sentenced to life in prison.\\"US professor among 5 sentenced to die in Ethiopia\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 22 December 2009 (accessed 22 December 2009). Berhanu became a full professor at Bucknell University on spring of 2015. In July 2015, Berhanu went to Eritrea, to permanently join the \\"freedom fighters\\" that have been receiving help from the government of Isayas Afewerki, a long time leader of the Red Sea state. In January 2016, he returned to the United States to \\"update\\" his supporters and raise funds for his organization.\\"Ginbot 7 Chairman Prof. Berhanu Nega‚Äôs Full speech in Washington D.C ‚Äì January 31, 2016\\" Following the ascent of Abiy Ahmed to the premiership and the resultant opening of the political scene (including the high-profile release of Ginbot 7's secretary-general, Andargachew Tsige), charges were dropped against Berhanu, as part of a wide-scale, unilateral amnesty and he returned to Ethiopia to reassume the role of peaceful political opposition. In May 2019, Berhanu's Ginbot 7 merged with six other liberal- nationalist opposition parties, including the Unity for Democracy and Justice and Blue Party to form the Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice party, of which Berhanu was elected leader. Personal life Berhanu is married to Dr. Nardos Minasse an Ethiopian born American optometrist in 1989. They have two children together (Noah and Iyassu). His family continues to live in Pennsylvania where his wife, Dr. Nardos, practices optometry. Berhanu is a fan of Arsenal FC, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia Eagles.

Jack was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. He worked with McIlwraith McEacharn, managing the Melbourne office while still in his twenties, and later became a director. He was also involved with the company's lead-manufacturing concern. McIlwraith played for Melbourne Cricket Club, scoring more than 1500 runs in the 1883-84 season. He was selected to play for Victoria in 1884-85. He was the outstanding batsman in the short Australian first-class season in 1885-86, scoring 315 runs at an average of 78.75, with two centuries; only one other batsman scored a century, and the next most successful batsman made 201 runs.

Probably completed from 1513 to 1516, it is believed to be his final painting. The original size of the painting was 69 √ó 57 cm. It is now exhibited at the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris, France.  Subject matter  The work depicts John the Baptist in isolation. Through the use of chiaroscuro, the figure appears to emerge from the shadowy background. The saint is dressed in pelts, has long curly hair and is smiling in an enigmatic manner reminiscent of Leonardo's famous Mona Lisa. He holds a reed cross in his left hand while his right hand points up toward heaven like that of Saint Anne in Leonardo's Burlington House Cartoon. According to Frank Z√∂llner, Leonardo's use of sfumato \\"conveys the religious content of the picture,\\" and that \\"the gentle shadows imbue the subject's skin tones with a very soft, delicate appearance, almost androgynous in its effect\\". Kenneth Clark claimed that for Leonardo, Saint John represented \\"the eternal question mark, the enigma of creation\\", and noted the sense of \\"uneasiness\\" that the painting imbues. Barolsky adds that: \\"Describing Saint John emerging from the darkness in almost shockingly immediate relation to the beholder, Leonardo magnifies the very ambiguity between spirit and flesh. The grace of Leonardo's figure, which has a disturbingly erotic charge, nonetheless conveys a spiritual meaning to which Saint John refers when he speaks of the fullness of grace from God.\\"  Dating  The dating of Saint John the Baptist is disputed. It was seen by Antonio de Beatis in Leonardo's workshop at Clos Luc√©; his diary entry giving a terminus ante quem of 17October 1517. Traditionally the painting has been considered the artist's last and dated to 1513‚Äì1516; Leonardo's sfumato technique here being considered to have reached its apogee. Some experts, however, have compared the hand of Saint John to a similar work by a pupil in the Codex Atlanticus, dating the commencement of the picture to around 1509. The pose is also similar to that of a sculpture of the same subject completed after 1510 for the Florence Baptistery by Giovanni Francesco Rustici. Leonardo is thought to have given Rustici technical advice for his commission; it is possible that one artist could have influenced the other with the idea for the pose. Provenance Saint John the Baptist was apparently part of the French king Francis I's collection at Fontainebleau in 1542. In 1625 Charles I of England received the painting from Louis XIII of France in return for a Titian Holy Family and Holbein's Portrait of Erasmus. In 1649 Charles's collection was sold, whereupon the painting entered into the hands of the banker Eberhard Jabach. After a spell in the possession of Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661 the work once again returned to the King of France ‚Äì Louis XIV. Following the French Revolution the painting entered the collection at the Louvre where it remains to this day. Influence Prior to this work, Saint John had traditionally been portrayed as a gaunt ascetic. Leonardo's innovative depiction proved influential upon Raphael's workshop; several portraits of Saint John painted around 1517‚Äì18 attributed to Raphael and Giulio Romano show a similarly youthful saint in isolation, with a strong contrast between the dark background and the illumination of the figure. Numerous copies and variations of Saint John the Baptist made by Leonardeschi exist.

It is also called Gorey Castle by English-speakers, and l√© Vi√®r Ch√¢t√© (the Old Castle) by J√®rriais-speakers. Mont Orguell Castle - view from Gorey quay wall History The site had been fortified in the prehistoric period, but the construction of the castle was undertaken following the division of the Duchy of Normandy in 1204. The castle was first mentioned in 1212. The castle was the primary defence of Jersey until the development of gunpowder which then rendered the castle ultimately indefensible from Mont Saint Nicholas, the adjacent hill which overlooks the castle. Mont Orgueil was updated with platforms for artillery constructed in 1548 and 1549 under the direction of Henry Cornish, Lieutenant of the Earl of Hertford in Jersey. Cornish complained that earlier repairs to the donjon by Robert Raymont had left it so weak it was vulnerable to musket shot; \\"lyke a nadyl eye scarse abyll to byde a hagboshe.\\" In 1543 he had asked for a \\"saker\\" cannon that would cover the sands between \\"Grovyll\\" and the castle, where the French had landed in the past.HMC, Seymour Papers, vol.4 (1967), pp. 85‚Äì86, 91, 106‚Äì8. Mont Orgueil was to be superseded by Elizabeth Castle off Saint Helier, the construction of which commenced at the end of the 16th century. Walter Raleigh, Governor of Jersey in 1600, rejected a plan to demolish the old castle to recycle the stone for the new fortifications with the words: \\"'twere pity to cast it down\\". Mont Orgueil () has guarded Jersey's east coast since the 13th century. The old castle continued to be used as the island's only prison until the construction of a prison in St. Helier at the end of the 17th century. The English Government found it expedient to send troublesome agitators such as William Prynne and John Lilburne to Mont Orgueil far from the realm of England. The regicides Thomas Waite, Henry Smith, James Temple, Hardress Waller, and Gilbert Millington were transferred to Mont Orgueil in 1661. During the English Civil War, from March 1643 the then Lieutenant Governor and Bailif of the island, Sir Philippe de Carteret held out for the Royalists in Elizabeth Castle. Leaving his wife Anne de Carteret, and their son Philippe de Carteret to occupy Mont Orgueil. It was from Mont Orgueil that the Royalists under Sir George Carteret retook the island from Parliament in November 1643. In December 1651 the island was invaded by Parliament, however faced with the prospect of modern artillery being deployed on the adjacent hill Mont St. Nicholas, the fortress was surrendered with generous terms allowing those inside to go to Elizabeth Castle.The Journal of Jean Chevalier, 1643‚Äì1651, vol 1‚Äì4, translated R.V.L. Rybot, (Soci√©t√© Jersiaise)G.R. Balleine, Balleine's History of Jersey, ed. M. Syvret & J. Stevens, (Andover, Phillimore for Soci√©t√© Jersiaise, 2011) pp. 111‚Äì139 A report for the States of Jersey in 1691 declared that the barracks accommodation was so dilapidated that it was impossible to quarter troops there. Two years later, the castle was stated to be in a ruinous condition and subsequently was abandoned as a prison, because Elizabeth Castle had been built and the castle was neglected and not needed any more. Repairs were carried out 1730‚Äì1734 and for the rest of the century, parts of the castle were adapted for garrison accommodation. Given full access to the castle from 1795, Admiral Philippe d'Auvergne who was working for the British secret service, to destabilise the French Revolutionary government through an organisation he was running in Brittany and mainland Normandy including the smuggling of people with forged documents and materiel into France together with forged French Assignat notes, which were being mass- produced in London with the successful result of causing hyperinflation which raged in France until 1802. In 1800, the Corbelled Tower was fitted out for use by d'Auvergne as his headquarters. In 1846, the castle was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The castle has also hosted subsequent royal ceremonies to welcome George V in 1921 and Elizabeth II; inscriptions mark the occasions. Until the second half of the 19th century, the castle was open to the public on one day a year, Easter Monday, and crowds used to flock from all over the island. This is believed to be a survival of the pre-Reformation custom of visiting St. George's Chapel inside the castle on St. George's Day. In a generally ruinous state at the time of its handover to the people of Jersey by the Crown on 28 June 1907, Mont Orgueil has been managed as a museum site since 1929, although during the Second World War German occupation (1940‚Äì1945), the occupying forces garrisoned the castle and added modern fortifications camouflaged to blend in with existing structures. Present day The heritage site has been managed by the Jersey Heritage Trust since 1994. In the early 21st century, the Trust planned to build a Tudor hall within the castle's keep. Around the same time, a ¬£3 million grant was given to fund restoration work. In 2004, a commemorative Jersey pound note was put into circulation depicting Mont Orgueil. The castle is depicted on the 2010 issue Jersey 50-pound note. On 2 April 2006, after a long building programme, the castle was reopened to the public by the Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey. Restoration work has opened up previously inaccessible areas of the castle to the public. Newly built additions in modern style have enclosed sections of the castle and made them weatherproof, parts of the structure have been reinterpreted, and artistic interventions in the grounds and structure of the castle have provided attractions for visitors.https://www.jerseyheritage.org/places-to-visit/mont-orgueil-castle See also *Fort Regent *Elizabeth Castle References * * Customs, Ceremonies & Traditions of the Channel Islands, Lempri√®re, London 1976, * External links *Mont Orgueil Castle Homepage *Bibliography of sources related to Mont Orgueil Castle *Time Team's Mont Orguiel Dig Report Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1450 Category:Castles in Jersey Category:Museums in Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Saint Martin, Jersey Category:Archaeological sites in Jersey Category:Prisons in Jersey Category:German occupation of Jersey during World War II Category:World War II sites in the Channel Islands Category:Burial sites of the Seymour family ","title":"Mont Orgueil"},{"id":"2534632","text":"Jean Bruce (22 March 1921 - 26 March 1963), born Jean Brochet, was a prolific French popular writer.

Though the first OSS 117 Is Not Dead film with Ivan Desny in the lead was already made in 1957, a popular series of several OSS 117 films started no earlier than in 1963, following the French release of Dr. No with Kerwin Mathews in two, director Andr√© Hunebelle's discovery Frederick Stafford in two more, John Gavin in one (replacing Stafford who was starring in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz, then with Luc Merenda and Alan Scott in two in the 1970s that were French made for TV films. In 2006 the action spoof OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies starring Jean Dujardin as OSS 117 became a surprise international hit. After his death, his wife Josette Bruce (who died in 1996) continued to write 143 new titles for the OSS 117 character beginning in 1966 until her death. After her death their son and daughter Fran√ßois and Martine Bruce wrote 24 books up until 1992. Films of some of Bruce's other books such as Le vicomte r√®gle ses comptes (The Viscount) with Kerwin Mathews and Cinq Gars pour Singapour (Five Ashore in Singapore) with Sean Flynn were made. Jean-Paul Belmondo played both a Jean Bruce type writer and his OSS 117 type creation in Philippe de Broca's Le Magnifique.

Zip City falls within the U.S. Central Time Zone. It is part of the Florence - Muscle Shoals Metropolitan Statistical Area known as \\"The Shoals\\". History The first non-indigenous settlement was made at Zip City in 1817. Zip City received its unusual name from the fact drivers would \\"zip\\" through town heading towards the Tennessee state line, where they could buy alcohol. The name dates from the 1920s. In popular culture Zip City, of late, has been popularized by the Drive-By Truckers song of the same name. The song was penned by the Truckers' co-founder, Mike Cooley, (a longtime resident of the area) in 2001. The song appeared on the Truckers' 2002 release, Southern Rock Opera. Said the band's other co-founder, Patterson Hood, of the song: : \\"Cooley wrote this one and should be the one explaining it. I do know that it is at least 90% true and is my personal favorite song on the album.\\" While interviewing the band in 2002, David Dye of the radio program \\"The World Cafe\\" had this to say about the song: :\\"People around the country call the radio stations that carry this show and say this Album (Southern Rock Opera) is their life, and \\"Zip City\\" is most certainly one I get that from.\\" References External links *Satellite Image from Wikimapia *\\"Zip City\\" by Drive-By Truckers Lyrics Category:Unincorporated communities in Lauderdale County, Alabama Category:Florence‚ÄìMuscle Shoals metropolitan area Category:Unincorporated communities in Alabama ","title":"Zip City, Alabama"},{"id":"2534638","text":"Reginald Charles Allen (2 July 1858 in Glebe, New South Wales ‚Äì 2 May 1952 in Sydney) was an Australian cricketer who played in one Test match against England in 1886‚Äì87. Allen also played for New South Wales and was top scorer in the first innings of the state match against the England team - under the name \\"A. Shaw's XI\\" - that immediately preceded the second Test. He batted at No 3 in his only Test, scored 14 and 30, and took two catches. In his second innings, he was caught by one of his own side, Charlie Turner, who was fielding as a substitute for England. His obituary in Wisden in 1953 says that he turned down the opportunity to tour England in 1888 under the captaincy of PS McDonnell. Allen, who attended Sydney Grammar School, was a successful scholar. He attained the highest mark in the New South Wales Public Examinations in his final year at school, and was later awarded the University Medal at the University of Sydney. Although he was not athletic in build, he was also a successful all-round sportsman, representing Sydney University's First Grade Rugby Union team, and playing in the New South Wales Open Tennis Championship (which was then entirely amateur). He became an enthusiastic and moderately successful breeder and owner of racehorses. His father was George Wigram Allen, a lawyer and politician. After University, Allen joined his father's law firm (now known as Allens), of which he remained a partner for several decades. He was the uncle of the England Test captain Gubby Allen, who was born in Australia.

It was later released for the SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega CD, Master System, and Game Gear. The plot revolves around biotechnology researcher Kal Morrow and his son Saul. When the former is kidnapped by the evil Chimera organization, Saul uses one of his father's inventions to turn himself into a wolf-human hybrid (similar to a werewolf) that may be capable of defeating Chimera. Wolfchild was designed by Simon Phipps, also responsible for the earlier Switchblade 2, a rather similar game. The action is viewed from the side and scrolls in eight directions. The player must guide Saul through five levels, negotiating platforms and shooting various monsters, the result of Chimera experiments. Initially, the player character is Saul in his normal, human form. Only when enough energy has been collected does he turn into a wolf-human, giving him much better attack techniques. Reception Gary Whitta of ACE magazine gave the Amiga version a score of 905 (out of a possible 1000), praising its animation, speed and responsiveness, and generally deeming it executed better than Switchblade 2. Mega said that the Sega CD version was overpriced and did not make use of the hardware. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a 5 out of 10, commenting \\"It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the game play department. ... the overall game is dull and rather unappealing.\\" They gave the Genesis version a 5.25 out of 10, saying it was identical to the earlier Sega CD version aside from the CD music, and that the game was overlong with repetitive gameplay which quickly becomes dull.

They are commonly known as milkworts or snakeroots. The genus is distributed widely throughout much of the worldPolygala. Flora of China. in temperate zones and the tropics.Polygala. The Jepson eFlora 2013. The genus name Polygala comes from the ancient Greek \\"much milk\\", as the plant was thought to increase milk yields in cattle. Description As traditionally circumscribed, Polygala includes annual and perennial plants, shrubs, vines, and trees. The roots often have a scent reminiscent of wintergreen. The leaf blades are generally undivided and smooth-edged, and are alternately arranged in most species. The inflorescence is a raceme or spikelike array of several flowers; the occasional species bears solitary flowers. The flower is bilateral in shape, with two large petal-like sepals on the sides, often called the \\"wings\\", and three smaller sepals behind. There are three petals in shades of reddish purple, yellow or white, which are joined at the bases. The lower of the three is the keel petal, which is \\"boat-shaped, cucullate [hood- like], or helmet-shaped\\". The keel petal may have a beak or a fringe on the tip. Stamens and style are within the curve of the keel petal. The fruit is a capsule, sometimes winged. It contains two seeds, which are usually black, hairy and tipped with a large white aril. No members of this genus are known to form nitrogen-fixing nodules. Taxonomy The genus Polygala was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1754. Phylogenetic studies showed that, as traditionally circumscribed, the genus was not monophyletic. It had become a \\"wastebasket taxon\\"; almost all species with a flower apparently similar to those of the Papilionoideae ‚Äì two petaloid lateral sepals forming 'wings', two petals forming a 'standard', and one petal forming a 'keel', plus a bilocular fruit capsule ‚Äì were placed in Polygala, while species with more obviously specialized features, particularly those of the fruit, were placed in other genera. In 2011, John Richard Abbott separated some more sharply defined genera from Polygala. =Species= Partly because of differing circumscriptions, the reported number of valid species in the genus varies from about 350Coelho, V.

Early life and career The younger brother of leading Australian cricketer and Australian rules footballer George Giffen, Walter Giffen was born in Norwood, South Australia on 20 September 1861, to Richard Giffen, a carpenter and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Challand). Giffen played alongside his brother at Norwood Football Club, where he was a member of the 1879 Norwood premiership team, and firstly at Norwood Cricket Club before they moved to Adelaide Cricket Club ahead of the 1894/95 season.Harte, p. 132. First-class cricket career Giffen made his first-class debut for South Australia on 24 March 1883, against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, scoring a duck (out of a total of 23) and eight as South Australia lost by an innings and 98 runs. He struck better form the next season, against Victoria at Adelaide Oval, top scoring in South Australia's second innings with what was called \\"a faultless 89\\"Stanton, p. 11. (his highest first-class score) as South Australia lost by four wickets. Giffen lost the tops of two fingers when he got his left hand trapped between a pair of cog-wheels in 1886 at the South Australian Gas Company's Brompton Gasworks. Considered a sound batsman with a solid defence, Giffen's strength was his fielding in the deep and he \\"possessed a capital return to the wicket\\". Giffen made his Test debut against England in February 1887 and was involved in a controversial event when Giffen, batting, hit the ball back to the bowler George Lohmann, who knocked the ball on the half volley to W.G. Grace at point. Grace then claimed the catch, and the unsighted umpire gave Giffen out.Rae, p. 142. In 1891 Giffen played for South Australia against the touring English side, making 65 in a total of 562, South Australia's then highest ever score, before being forced to retire hurt when his brother drove a ball straight back down the wicket, hitting the non-striker Giffen on the fingers of his right hand, injuring them so he was unable to continue his innings.Giffen, p. 22. In a 1894/95 match against the touring English side, Giffen and Clem Hill added 192 for the eighth wicket, which remained the record South Australian first-class eighth wicket stand until February 2002/03 when Brad Young and Mick Miller added 222 against Queensland. Controversy over Australian selection Giffen has been called \\"one of the worst Test batsmen of all time\\" and it was alleged that Giffen played Test cricket only because George refused to play unless Walter was also selected. The Australian media was particularly scathing of Giffen's national selection, with The Bulletin publishing a poem ridiculing him and stating \\"The big black spot on the selection of the Australian Eleven for England is Walter Giffen, whose proper place is in a second eleven. He is simply the brother of George Giffen and that is all.\\"The Bulletin, \\"Sporting Notions\\", Vol. 12., No. 675., 21 January 1893, p. 21. George Giffen always denied having any influence over his brother's inclusion in Australian teams, arguing that Giffen had been picked on the strength of very good batting and when he did not have success in England, \\"nobody was more surprised than myself, for I had always thought that he would acquit himself well on English grounds.\\"Giffen, p. 80. Personal In 1896 it was reported that Giffen was an owner of the lucrative \\"Lucky Hit\\" gold mine near Blumberg in the Adelaide Hills as well as working in the mine.\\"Walter Giffen\\", The Inquirer and Commercial News (Perth), 20 November 1896, p. 3. While there Giffen continued to play cricket, including scoring 150* and 150 for Blumberg Cricket Club against Mount Pleasant and Mount Torrens respectively.Harte, p. 141.

After having studied at the Arts and Crafts School of Palma for two years, he enrolled at the Fine Arts School of Barcelona in 1974. However, he only studied at this school for a few months. Damiano, Michael. Porque La Vida No Basta; Encuentros Con Miquel Barcel√≥. Anagrama, 2013. A year later he returned to Mallorca to participate in the happenings and actions of protest of the group \\"Taller Llun√†tic\\", a conceptual avantgarde group. He also took part in the creation of their artist periodical Neon de Suro (21 issues from 1957‚Äì1982). A year after his return to Mallorca he had his first one-man show at the Palma Museum. Initially the Avant-garde, Art Brut and American abstract Expressionism (e.g. Pollock had a big impact on him) influenced Barcel√≥'s work. On the other hand, he was always particularly interested in the Baroque paintings of Diego Vel√°zquez, Tintoretto and Rembrandt. Jean Dubuffet inspired Barcel√≥ in adopting an experimental attitude. Throughout the 1980s, he travelled extensively across Europe, the United States and West Africa ‚Äì always returning to Paris which became a second home and where he set up a second studio. The time Barcel√≥ spent in different countries, his nomadism or peripatetic habits essentially influenced and inspired his work, most strongly the impressions of West Africa. His participation at the \\"Documenta 7\\", Kassel, Germany, in 1982 gained him international recognition. In 1983 he moved to Naples for five months. Here he realized some works made with volcanic cinder, for an exhibition at the Lucio Amelio's atelier. In this occasion he also answered the international call of the Neapolitan gallerist, after the 1980s earthquake, in which he asked the major contemporary artist of that time to create a work for the Terrae Motus collection. His work L'ombra che trema, now exhibited at the Royal Palace of Caserta, as he declared: \\"It's a self portrait: i made myself in the painting act. the shadow seems to reflect the other part of myself and at the same time is the destruction of the order.\\" In 1986 he received Spain's National Award for Plastic Arts. In 2004 Barcel√≥'s watercolours, illustrating Dante's Divine Comedy, were shown at the Louvre Museum in Paris. For Palma Cathedral's Chapel of Sant Pere, Barcel√≥ covered the entire chapel with terracotta, decorating it with images related to the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St. John, the miracle of the multiplication of bread and fish, a theme chosen because the chapel is dedicated to the Last Supper. In 1990 he designed the costumes and stage sets for Manuel de Falla's opera El retablo de maese Pedro at the Op√©ra- Comique in Paris, and in 2006 at the Festival d'Avignon he was part of a performance with choreographer Joseph Nadj. On 18 November 2008 the Spanish government officially presented Miquel Barcel√≥'s latest immense work of art in the United Nations Palace of Nations in Geneva. The work of art is a massive sculptural installation located on the domed ceiling of the building's newly created Chamber XX of Human rights and Alliance of Civilizations. The work consists of 1500 m2 of multi-coloured stalactite forms for which the artist used 100 tons of paint, that appear to be dripping from the ceiling. In 2010, Barcel√≥ was invited to teach at a workshop by the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Architecture de Versailles. Barcel√≥'s work (paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics) is nowadays represented by Tobias Mueller Modern Art in Z√ºrich, Galerie Bruno Bischofberger in Z√ºrich and Acquavella Galleries in New York City. In 2017, Miquel Barcel√≥ has been elected a vice-president of CISAC at the 2017 General Assembly in Lisbon.

It is currently a multi-disciplinary arts venue which plays host to art exhibitions and concerts. Built in 1827, the Old Parliament House is the oldest government building and perhaps the oldest surviving building in Singapore. The building was home to the Parliament of Singapore from 1965 to 1999, when it moved to an adjacent new building. History The building occupies one of the most historic sites of Singapore. During the refurbishment of the building in 1989, archaeological evidence of older habitation in the area was uncovered with stoneware and earthenware dating back the 13th and 14th centuries found. The building's river frontage was also where the founder of modern Singapore Stamford Raffles was presumed to have landed on 29 January 1819. The area was occupied by Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his family and followers. Raffles would later persuaded the Temenggong to move to Telok Blangah in 1823 as he planned for the land to be used for public and administrative purposes. =Design and construction= The original building in 1846, then known as the Public Offices of the Settlement, in sketch by John Turnbull Thomson. Coleman's original building had been changed considerably since. The building was designed as a Neo-Palladian mansion by architect George Drumgoole Coleman for a Scottish merchant, John Argyle Maxwell, who was based in Java. It was intended to be his private residence, however, Maxwell never occupied the house due in part to a dispute over the ownership of the land on which the house was built. Raffles had originally allocated the land for government use in his Town Plan, however, Raffles' successor John Crawfurd issued a permit allowing Maxwell to build a house on the site. The construction of the Old Parliament House began in 1826 and it was completed in 1827. Maxwell applied for a statutory grant to the site in 1827, and the then Resident Councillor of Singapore John Prince objected as the land was intended for government use. A compromise was then struck whereby Maxwell was granted a 999-year lease in June 1827, but the house would be leased back to the government for a 500 rupees monthly rent. Later Maxwell's residence went up for auction which the colonial government won with a bid of $15,600 Spanish dollars, and the ownership of the courthouse finally transferred to Governor George Bonham and the East India Company on 10 October 1842. =Extension and uses= The building was initially used as a court house, and other government offices including the Land Office also moved into the building. The first court session was held in the central room on the first floor at the front of the building. In 1839, a new single-storey annex was built on an adjacent plot of land, forming what is now the Former Attorney General's Chambers building later incorporated into the Parliament House. The Courts then moved into this new building (later on to Empress Place Building), and the vacated space was then used for government offices. The government offices were sited at the building until 1875 when the Supreme Court moved back in after the building was renovated. The building went through several major extension works. The first was carried out between 1873 and 1875 by John Frederick Adolphus McNair. In 1901, the building was extended towards the Singapore River. Coleman's original design was lost as a result of the extension works. In 1909, two courtrooms were reconstructed and a residence for the Attorney General was built, and the architectural style of the building was transformed from Coleman's Neo-Palladian design to appear more Victorian. In 1939, the Supreme Court moved into its new building further down the road, and the building was then used as a storehouse, and later for the Department of Social Welfare after the Second World War. The bronze elephant statue at the Old Parliament House. The building was refurbished again in 1953 to make way for the new Legislative Assembly of Singapore, and works were completed in July 1954. The design was carried out by T. H. H. Hancock who was the Senior Architect of the Public Works Department of Singapore. The Legislative Assembly was opened by the then governor Sir John Fearns Nicoll. The Arts House served as one of the two venues held for the opening of the 14th Parliament of Singapore on 24 August 2020, the other being Parliament House; the multiple venues were used for the first time in Singapore's history as a precaution measure for social distancing as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. =As Parliament House= When the then Chief Minister David Marshall was elected in 1955, he was given an office in the building. The building was renamed Parliament House in August 1965 when Singapore gained independence. A bronze statue of an elephant is located at the front of the Old Parliament House which was a gift from King Chulalongkorn or King Rama V of Siam (now known as Thailand) as a token of appreciation after his stay on 16 March 1871. The country is the first foreign nation visited by a Siamese King. It was originally located at the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall but was replaced in 1919 with a statue for Stamford Raffles. The arches at the porch of the building and Palladian windows of the front fa√ßade were part of the original design, although the building currently appeared more Neoclassical in style. The building was gazetted a national monument on 14 February 1992. On 6 September 1999, the Parliament of Singapore moved into an adjacent new building which faces North Bridge Road. The Arts House at The Old Parliament The Arts House at The Old Parliament opened on 26 March 2004 as an arts and heritage centre. The old building was restored, and the furnishings and the design were preserved. The Chambers were converted into a function room where music performances could be held. Art exhibitions and other functions are also regularly held at the gallery, which has Tuscan style-columns and cornices.

Polyhalite crystallizes in the triclinic system, although crystals are very rare. The normal habit is massive to fibrous. It is typically colorless, white to gray, although it may be brick red due to iron oxide inclusions. It has a Mohs hardness of 3.5 and a specific gravity of 2.8. It occurs in sedimentary marine evaporites and is a major potassium ore mineral in the Carlsbad deposits of New Mexico. It is also present as a 2‚Äì3% contaminant of Himalayan salt. Polyhalite was first described in 1818 for specimens from its type locality in Salzburg, Austria. The name comes from the German Polyhalit, which comes from the Ancient Greek words (polys) and ' (hals), which mean \\"many\\" and \\"salt\\", and the German ending -it (which comes from the Latin ending -ites, which originally also came from Greek), which is used like the English ending -ite to form the names of certain chemical compounds.https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/polyhalite Despite the similarity in names between polyhalite and halite (the naturally occurring form of table salt), their only connection is that both are evaporite minerals. The use of the Greek words for many and salt in polyhalite is due to polyhalite consisting of several metals that can form salts in the more general sense of the word salt used in chemistry.  Production  The only polyhalite mined in the world comes from a layer of rock over below the North Sea off the North Yorkshire coast in the UK. Deposited 260 million years ago, it lies below the potash seam at the Boulby Mine. In 2010, the first mining operations of the polyhalite mineral commenced at Boulby Mine, the mine is currently the only producer of polyhalite which is marketed by Israel Chemicals as polysulphate. In 2016, Sirius Minerals announced plans for the Woodsmith Mine, a new polyhalite mine in the area., In March 2020, the project was taken over by Anglo American plc.

He wrote on principles of public and business administration in the 1920s. Life Oliver Sheldon was born on 13 July 1894. He was educated at King's College School and Merton College, Oxford. In World War I he served as an officer in the Royal Engineers, and was mentioned in despatches. He joined the Rowntree Company in 1919 as Personal Assistant to Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, and in 1931 was appointed to the general Board of Directors at Rowntree.Rosamund Thomas, The British Philosophy of Administration: A comparison of British and American ideas 1900-1939, 1978, p.255-7 At Rowntree's, Sheldon was a colleague of Lyndall Urwick and, like Urwick, was an active member of the Taylor Society.'The Art of Management: from a British Point of View', Bulletin of the Taylor Society (December 1923)'Taylor the Creative Leader', Bulletin of the Taylor Society (February 1924) He founded York Georgian Society in 1939 and was one of the four men who founded York Civic Trust in 1946.http://yorkcivictrust.co.uk/about/history-york-civic- trust/ The University of York's Borthwick Institute for Archives cites Sheldon as its inspiration and creator in 1949 and 1950; and the Borthwick Institute was one of the founding elements of the University in 1963 https://www.york.ac.uk/borthwick/history/origins/. Management philosophy Sheldon was closely involved in restructuring the management and organization of the growing confectionery company at a stage where its growth meant by necessity it had to move away from the personal, family-centred management of its founder, Joseph Rowntree, towards a more professional culture. Under the chairmanship of Joseph's son, Seebohm, the company adopted Sheldon's proposals for a more functional style of organisation, but he tempered this with a belief, shared by the Rowntree firm's senior managers, that industry existed for more than the profit of shareholders. Sheldon held that good management was about more than technique - it should be concerned with human understanding. \\"The leadership of men calls for patience, courage, and, above all, sympathy.\\" Service to the community was the primary motive and fundamental basis of industry. Human relations approach Consequently, Sheldon advocated a human relations style of management which placed the individual in a human context involving a range of emotional and psychological needs. In this, he disagreed fundamentally with contemporaries such as F.W. Taylor, who saw economic need as being the primary motivator of workers. Anticipating later writers such as Elton Mayo and Frederick Herzberg by some years, Sheldon argued that, while basic economic needs must be met, wider personal and community needs were equally important. Industry was key to shaping society and the leaders and managers of industry consequently had to work to ethical considerations which were greater than purely financial. While stressing the need for efficiency, he saw service and democracy as complementary to this - reflecting long established Rowntree practices, introduced by Joseph and extended by Seebohm Rowntree and Oliver Sheldon, such as ensuring their workers were paid a \\"living wage\\", had decent working conditions and were consulted on and involved in decision making in the workplace. Both the firm and individual directors were closely involved in a range of community work, often motivated by their Quaker religious beliefs and/or their Liberal politics. Influence on Rowntree's In 1904, Joseph Rowntree had given away half his personal fortune and almost two-thirds of the shares in the company to three Trusts to pursue a range of charitable, social and political work. All three continue today in the forms of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (which includes the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. All are still based in York.Katherine A. Webb, Oliver Sheldon and the Foundations of the University of York (York: Borthwick Institute, 2009). Although with the passage of time, the Rowntree company was to change and develop in new ways (particularly with new brands and marketing from the 1930s on), and in 1988 was controversially bought by Nestl√©, it retained a tradition of good management throughout, in keeping with the philosophy of its founder and those around him. Sheldon explored this in his 1923 book, The Philosophy of Management, which demonstrated his twin concerns for sound business and ethical practice when he stated: \\"The cost of building the Kingdom of Heaven will not be found in the profit and loss accounts of industry, but in the record of every man's conscientious service.\\" Writings * The Philosophy of Management, London: Pitman, 1923.

The series explores the adventures of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi prior to Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. Plot Qui-Gon Jinn and Adi Gallia are sent with their young padawans to the planet of Kegan. They must pick up O-Lana - a Force-sensitive baby - and take her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant without interfering with the customs and isolationist-centered ideology of the planet. However, the nature of this culture ends up compromising the original mission when Siri Tachi and Obi-Wan Kenobi are mistaken for orphaned children, captured, and put in a school known as the Learning Circle. This school is a brainwashing camp, where Keganite children are preached the ideals of V-Tan and O-Vieve, the Benevolent Guides who are the cause of Kegan's isolationism. While at the school, Siri and Obi- Wan meet several Keganite children and discuss the reality of the situation. Meanwhile, the apprentices try to talk sense into O-Bin, their \\"teacher\\".

He is widely remembered for his opposition to the partition of India, as well as efforts in achieving the Official Language of India status for Hindi. He was customarily given the title Rajarshi (etymology: Raja + Rishi = Royal Saint). He was popularly known as UP Gandhi. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 1961. Early life Purushottam Das Tandon was born in Allahabad. After obtaining a degree in law and an MA in history, he started practicing in 1906 and joined the bar of Allahabad High Court in 1908 as a junior to Tej Bahadur Sapru. He gave up practice in 1921 to concentrate on public activities. Tandon ji worked as Professor of Hindi at Victoria College, Gwalior. Freedom struggle He was a member of Indian National Congress since his student days in 1899. In 1906, he represented Allahabad in the All India Congress Committee. He was associated with the Congress Party committee that studied the Jallianwala Bagh incident in 1919. In the 1920s and 1930s he was arrested for participating in the Non-Cooperation movement and Salt Satyagraha respectively. He and Jawaharlal Nehru were among the people arrested even before Mohandas K. Gandhi returned from the Round Table Conference at London in 1931. He was known for his efforts in farmers' movements and he served as the President, Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha in 1934. He also remained President of Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), a social service organisation founded by Lala Lajpat Rai, in 1921. He worked as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the present-day Uttar Pradesh for a period of 13 years, from 31 July 1937 to 10 August 1950. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1946. Post-Independence He tried for the position of the President of the Congress Party unsuccessfully against Pattabhi Sitaramayya in 1948 but contested successfully against Acharya Kriplani in the controversial and difficult 1950 election to head the Nagpur session. He soon resigned from Congress's president post because of differences with Nehru and as Nehru's popularity was needed for winning elections. Nehru, while being the PM, also became the president of Congress for 1951 and 1952.Varshney, Ashutosh (updated 28 March 2015) Faults and lines. Indianexpress.com. Retrieved on 12 December 2018. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 and the Rajya Sabha in 1956. He retired from active public life after that due to indifferent health. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award in 1961. Controversies =Religious tolerance= Several controversies and contradictions abound in the life of Purushottam Das Tandon. While he emphasised the similarities between Hindu and Muslim cultures, he is regarded to have carried the image of a soft Hindu nationalist leader. He was not as successful as Gandhi in summoning religious ideals to aspects of Public Service despite being associated with the moderate Radha Soami sect. He and KM Munshi were among those who strongly opposed religious propagation and conversion of a people of one religion to another; they strongly argued in the constituent assembly for a condemnation in the constitution of religious conversion. =Opposition to the partition of India= On 12 June 1947, the Congress Working Committee met and passed a resolution accepting the partition of India. When the same had to be ratified on 14 June by the AICC, one of the dissenting voices came from Tandon. On that occasion, he said, \\"Acceptance of the resolution will be an abject surrender to the British and the Muslim League. The admission of the Working Committee was an admission of weakness and the result of a sense of despair. The Partition would not benefit either community ‚Äì the Hindus in Pakistan and the Muslims in India would both live in fear.\\" Thus, he was strongly opposed to the partition of India. =Relations with Nehru= He and Jawaharlal Nehru had good relations in the beginning; Nehru who commended the \\"No Tax\\" campaign started by Tandon in 1930. In the 1940s, the differences between them increased. While Tandon was not perceived to be power-hungry, his relation with Nehru was not on good terms and he was believed to be a prot√©g√© of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. In 1950, his successful election to the post of Congress President against Acharya Kriplani, who was widely believed to be backed by Nehru, put the latter in a tight spot. The relations between the party and the government suffered during that period. Subsequently, it became a sort of unwritten norm for the leader of the government to also be the party president or at the least, have a pliable candidate in the post. After Partition, Patel and Nehru developed differences over how to deal with the Muslim minority of India, especially as anti-Hindu violence reigned in Pakistan. Nehru argued that India's constitutional commitment to the security of its Muslim minority did not depend on how Pakistan treated its Hindu minority. Tandon, being close to Patel, differed with Nehru on this. So, Nehru launched an internal political battle against his own party's elected President and got the party's organisation to support his idea of secularism. Subsequently, it became clear that the nation's prime minister cannot be opposed by his party's elected president and Tandon resigned from the post of Congress' president to give way for Nehru. Tandon was elected president in 1950 and then Nehru was elected twice in 1951 and 1952. =Advocacy for Hindi= Despite Gandhi and other leaders advocating the adoption of Hindustani, a mixture of Hindi and Urdu, as the National language, he insisted on the usage of Devanagari script and the rejection of the Urdu script as well as words with Arabic-Persian roots. This led to him being called a political reactionary by Nehru. His attitude towards the Sanskritisation or making the language more formal was also controversial. His insistence on the usage of numerals of Devanagari script over the international system and his debates in the constituent assembly on adoption of Hindi as the official language irked Dravidian leaders. Anecdotes * A Speaker is supposed to be impartial and hence, speakers generally do not participate in their party meetings. Tandon, however, used to participate actively in his party meetings, as he was clear in his conscience that since he could separate these into different compartments, there should not be any issue. When he was questioned on this stand on the floor of the house, he offered to step down if any of the members of the house lacked confidence in him. No member pressed the issue. * As a staunch believer in ahimsa, he started using rubber chappals to avoid usage of leather. * Rajarshi Purushottam Das Tandon was at the time a member of parliament. Once, when he went to collect his salary cheque in the Parliament Office, he asked the clerk there to transfer the amount directly to a \\"Public Service Fund\\". The officials over there were pleasantly surprised by his generosity. One of his colleagues standing nearby said: \\"There are hardly four hundred rupees as your allowance for the whole month. And you are donating the entire amount for social service?\\" Tandon ji humbly replied ‚Äì \\"You see, I have seven sons and all are earning sufficiently to raise their families; each one sends me one hundred rupees per month. I spend only about rupees three to four hundred from that and the rest goes to some philanthropic causes. This allowance as a Member-of-Parliament is again extra for some one like me. Why should I save it for myself or my family? It was because of this natural austerity and detachment from selfish possessions that he was called a \\"Rajarishi\\". *He was fondly called Rajarishi by Mahatma Gandhi.

He was born in Stra√üburg in Elsass-Lothringen. From 1900 to 1906 he studied Law (inter alia) in Stra√üburg and in Berlin. In 1913 he accepted a position as professor at the University of Rostock, and after the First World War he returned to Strasbourg to the newly established University of Strasbourg. Redslob's ideas from his work Die parlamentarische Regierung in ihrer wahren und in ihrer unechten Form from 1918 had a remarkable influence on the German Weimar constitution of 1919. (The German title means ‚ÄòThe parliamentary government in its true form and in its false (imperfect, incorrect) form‚Äô. The addition to the title: Eine vergleichende Studie √ºber die Verfassungen von England, Belgien, Ungarn, Schweden und Frankreich is ‚ÄòA comparative survey of the constitutions of England, Belgium, Hungary, Sweden and France‚Äô.) In his capacity as a professor at The Hague Academy of International Law, Redslob introduced the concept of heimat in relation to international law in 1931. Redslob as a Modernist Legal Writer Scholar Nathaniel Berman, who has written extensively on law and international affairs contends that Redslob's work is an example of a modernist tendency that flourished in international law between World War I and World War II. According to Berman, \\"[f]or Redslob, the clash between the revolutionary aspirations of nationalism and the self-preserving will of established states was nothing less than that between 'creative freedom and legality.'\\" Comparing Redslob's position as a modernist legal thinker to Picasso's status as a modernist painter, Berman describes four tendencies in the modernist view of international law that are parallel to the basic principles of high modernism in art. The modernist principles of international law, reflected in the work of Redslob and others, are: # \\"A critique of the view of the sovereign state as the object which defines international law and to which it must seek to conform its doctrines and institutions\\"; # \\"Openness to hitherto repressed or denied forces of nationalism\\"; # \\"The unprecedented invention of a wide variety of techniques, understood as specifically legal\\"; # \\"Juxtaposition in international legal disputes, doctrines, and institutions, of elements incompatible under traditional legal criteria.\\" Berman's article has been cited as an example of the interdisciplinary approach that is prominent in the critical legal studies movement. Legal scholar David Kennedy, speaking of Berman's juxtaposition of Redslob and Picasso, said that \\"[w]hat is interesting is the way this juxtaposition foregrounds the role of the individual as a culture worker, the producer of legal texts and institutions.

It is situated north of Riddarfj√§rden and considered part of the historical province Uppland. Its area is with a perimeter of . The highest point is at Stadshagsplan at . The total population is 56,754 (December 31, 2007). Administratively, it is subdivided into the five districts Kungsholmen, Marieberg, Fredh√§ll, Kristineberg and Stadshagen. History =Establishment= Franciscan friars from the Grey Friar's Abbey, Stockholm, began living on the island in the 15th century. Because of this, the island was named Munkl√§gret (the Monks' encampment). The monks subsisted on cattle- breeding and fishing. They also managed the brickyard Sj√§lakoret at R√•lambshov. As a result of the Swedish Reformation, which was concluded at the parliament in V√§ster√•s 1527, the monks were expelled and the area became property of the crown. At the end of the 16th century, Johan III (son of Gustav Vasa) established an additional brickyard on the northern bank of the island. In 1635 the first bridge to Munkl√§gret was built. A few years later Queen Kristina donated large areas of land in the western part of the island to some of the generals from the Thirty Years War. They built magnificent entails and laid out great gardens. 1644 the crown donated the eastern part of Munkl√§gret to the authorities of the city of Stockholm, which then received its first city plan. Three years later the remainder of the island was donated. In order to facilitate migration to Munkl√§gret, privileges were given to artisans and manufacturers. For example, they were allowed to set up operations there without having to belong to the guilds and they were exempted from tax for ten years. In 1672 Munkl√§gret became a separate parish (Kungsholmen) and the whole island was renamed Kungsholmen. =Industrialization= When the Swedish Empire collapsed in the beginning of the 18th century the crown embarked on a generous economic policy to develop Kungsholmen. The entails were turned into factories and hospitals. In Hornsberg a cotton mill was established, at Marieberg a porcelain factory. In the early 19th century the military began to settle in Kungsholmen, which at the time was still a sparsely populated idyll. When Samuel Owen settled in Kungsholmen, it had begun developing into a marked district factories and workers. This development was accentuated when the Bolinder brothers start building up their business at Klara Sj√∂, west of the Kungsbron, (King's Bridge) in the mid-19th century. The company AB Separator was established at the end of the 19th century. AB Separator would soon become a worldwide group of companies and at the beginning of the 20th century had more than 2,000 employees. The industrial breakthrough led to a huge population explosion. The population grew from just over 4,000 people in 1860 to 26,000 in 1890. During the 1880s several apartment blocks were built to remedy the housing shortage. =Modern Kungsholmen= In the early 20th century a radical structural change took place on Kungsholmen. The traits from the old industrial district are swept away and instead housing and public institutions were erected. St. G√∂rans‚Äô church was designed by architect Gustaf Am√©en (1864‚Äì1949) and built in 1910. At the division of the Kungsholmen parish in 1925, the new parish was named after the church. The residential areas in Fredh√§ll and in Kristineberg were built in the 1930s after a functionalist city plan. The bridges V√§sterbron and Tranebergsbron were also built the same decade, and Sankt Eriksbron received its current dimensions. The Stockholm metro was drawn through Kungsholmen in the 1950s, first out to V√§llingby and later also to J√§rvaf√§ltet.

He was the author of the draft version of the constitution that was passed by the Weimar National Assembly and came into force in August 1919. He based it on three principles: all political authority belongs to the people; that the state should be organized on a federal basis; and that the Reich should form a democratic Rechtsstaat (state based in law) within the international community.Peter Stirk, \\"Hugo Preuss, German political thought and the Weimar constitution.\\" History of Political Thought (2002) 23#3 pp: 497-516. Early life and academic career Hugo Preu√ü was born in Berlin on 28 October 1860 as the only child of Levin Preu√ü (1820 or 1821-62), a Jewish owner of a lithographic business, and his wife Minna (n√©e Israel, 1826‚Äì99). Hugo's father died in 1862 and in 1863 his mother married her husband's brother, Leopold Preu√ü (1827‚Äì1905), a well-off grain merchant. After growing up in the western part of Berlin Hugo Preu√ü attended university from 1878 at Berlin and Heidelberg, studying Rechts- und Staatswissenschaften (law and governance) but with additional courses on history and philosophy. In May 1883, he passed the 1. Staatsexamen and in November was awarded the Dr. iur. at G√∂ttingen. He stopped working as a legal Referendar in 1886 and instead chose a career as an academic teacher. In 1889, he was habilitated with his publication Gemeinde, Staat, Reich als Gebietsk√∂rperschaften and began working as a Privatdozent (lecturer) at the university in Berlin. Although the quality of his writings was appreciated by academia, his Jewish religion and democratic-liberal views prevented him from becoming a tenured professor at the conservative Berlin university. In 1889, Preu√ü also married Else Liebermann, daughter of Carl Liebermann in Berlin. She was also related to Max Liebermann, the artist, and to Felix Liebermann. Hugo and Else had four sons, one of whom died early. The others were Ernst (*1891), Kurt (*1893) and Jean (Hans, *1901). In 1895, he became a member of the municipal parliament in Charlottenburg, Berlin. Only in 1906 did Preu√ü become a full professor, at the Berliner Handelshochschule newly founded by local merchants. He taught there until 1918, when he also was Rektor. His main focus was on constitutional law and on autonomous municipal administration (kommunale Selbstverwaltung). In 1906, the first volume of Die Entwicklung des deutschen St√§dtewesens was published. From 1910-18 he was honorary city councillor for the FVP. In this capacity he contributed to the project that what would later become the Greater Berlin Act. In 1912, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Reichstag. In his widely read publication Das deutsche Volk und die Politik of 1915 he forcefully argued for a transformation of the Obrigkeitsstaat into a Volksstaat. Revolution, political career and Weimar Constitution Only a few days after the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II had been announced during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, Preu√ü, in an article published on 14 November 1918, called on the middle-classes to \\"accept facts\\" and cooperate in creating the republic. On 15 November, the head of the revolutionary government, Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) appointed Preu√ü as Staatssekret√§r des Innern. At the time, the revolutionary Council of the People's Deputies (Rat der Volksbeauftragten) co-existed with the old Imperial bureaucracy. Although the Council served as the cabinet and took the important decisions, it lacked an administrative apparatus and thus made use of the existing structures. Under the old Imperial constitution, the Staatssekret√§re had been the heads of the various √Ñmter, not true ministers but more senior civil servants working for the Reichskanzler (chancellor). Preu√ü' role thus could be described as head of the \\"Ministry of the Interior\\". The Council of the People's Deputies tasked him with preparing a draft for a new republican constitution. In November, Preu√ü also was a founding member of the new DDP. On 13 February 1919, Preu√ü became Reichsinnenminister (Interior Minister) in the first elected government of the republic under Ministerpr√§sident Philipp Scheidemann (SPD). Preu√ü opposed vehemently the Triple Entente prohibition of the incorporation of German Austria into Germany as a contradiction of the Wilsonian principle of self-determination of peoples.Preuss denounces demand of allies, The New York Times, 14 September 1919 The government resigned on 20 June 1919 in protest against the Treaty of Versailles. It was followed by the government of Gustav Bauer (SPD), who appointed Preu√ü Reichskommissar f√ºr Verfassungsfragen (commissioner for constitutional issues). On 14 August 1919, the Weimar Constitution came into force. The final version of the constitution naturally was different from his original draft in various ways. Preu√ü' ideas were notably rejected concerning the reorganisation of the individual territories of the Reich‚Äîblocked by the new governments of the States. He also was unable to put into practice his idea of a very narrow definition of fundamental rights, limited to the classical freedoms, which he wanted to codify in just three articles of the constitution. Moreover, his attempt to change the nature of the second parliamentary chamber (made up of delegates from the individual State governments) proved impossible. However, some parts of the Weimar Constitution (on the role of parliament, government and Reichspr√§sident), considered especially problematic in hindsight, were strongly shaped by his ideas. In particular, the powerful position of the head of state, the Reichspr√§sident, who was given authority to dissolve the Reichstag with no effective limitations and who had considerable emergency powers under Article 48, did not appear to Preu√ü as a contradiction to the idea of a democratic state. He felt this was a necessary precaution to deal with the danger of a dictatorship of the parliamentary majority and to resolve conflicts between government and parliament by the most democratic method available‚Äîthrough new elections. Preu√ü also was pessimistic about the ability of the political parties to operate successfully within the new framework: they had no experience in taking on responsibility or with the sort of compromise required for stable government. Under the Empire the governments had operated mostly independently of the parties and the Reichstag majority of the day. Later life Honour grave of the Preu√ü family at the Urnenfriedhof in Berlin-Wedding From 1919 to 1925 Preu√ü was a member first of the Verfassunggebende Preu√üische Landesversammlung (1919/20), the equivalent of the National Assembly for the Freistaat Preu√üen, and then the Preu√üischer Landtag. He published numerous works on legal and constitutional issues as well as pro-republican writings. He was also active in the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. Hugo Preu√ü died in Berlin on 9 October 1925. He is buried at the Urnenfriedhof Gerchtsstra√üe Berlin-Wedding. Since 1952 the grave has been an Ehrengrab (honour grave) of what is now the State of Berlin. The Jewish background of the main author of its constitution was one reason why the Weimar Republic was referred to as Judenrepublik (\\"Jews' Republic\\") by its detractors on the right..

It is situated in the province Lapland, with its largest part in the G√§llivare Municipality. Furthermore, it belongs to the largely untouched UNESCO World Heritage classified Laponian area. Natural scenes include the old-growth forest with large trees, large boggy grounds, and deep ravines in between the rocks. Sweden's oldest known pine tree is also located here. It has been estimated to be at least 710 years old, as it was found to have withstood a forest fire in 1413.  Wildfires  Forest fires in the Muddus National Park have left traces on sample plots. There are fire scars on living or dead trees or charcoal fragments in the humus layer. The park was investigated on 75 separate sample plots. Some of the major fire years in the Muddus area coincide with forest fires in other parts of northern Sweden, in the taiga of western Russia, and in central Siberia. There is constant regeneration happening in the wildlife in the National Park. Forest fires were shown to have occurred in the five different types of forest. The fires that were most frequently occurring of fires in the pine forests occurred with within the span of 81‚Äì90 years, while the mean frequency was 110 years. The interval of time elapsed since the last forest fire occurred in the pine forests was 144 years. Some of the major fire years in the Muddus area coincide with forest fires in other parts of northern Sweden, in the taiga of western Russia, and in central Siberia.  Mires  In 1940 a range of mires were found in the Muddus National Park. The park also went under investigation for its mires and wetlands. The mires consisted from ombrotrophic bogs to rich fens. They are found to be very rich in bryophytes. There are 66 species and you can find them in dry habitats as well.  Geography  It is known for its waterfalls, deep ravines, low mountain and forest where the trees have seen many generations of people pass by. Wildlife = Birds = Due to a large-scale forestry landscape structure; the structure and composition of boreal bird communities are in North Sweden. Birds control the effects of patch size, forest age and tree species compositions. The most common birds that live in the park are Capercaillie. These birds are black grouse and hazel hen. They are constantly being reproduced in the forest year-round. The second most common bird that is found here is the Siberian jay and Siberian tit. These birds are intensely present mostly during the summer time. Other animals that reside in the park are whooper swans, bean geese and black-throated loons appear on the lakes. Located at the marshes of the park, cranes, sandpipers and snipes are present = Deers = Reindeer are in the Muddus National park are present in the area year-around. Although rare, there are also brown bears, lynx and wolverines in the park. It is common, to encounter reindeer, elk or some of the forests‚Äô and marshes‚Äô many birds. = Flora = The Muddus National Park trees show how large non-systematic variations are there. This is due to climatic changes because of industrialization in Sweden through the years. There are an abundance of spiders that have been found in the Muddus National Park. In particular, There has been four species of different genital characters of spiders have been found. This is due to the abundance of spruce, pine forest, and shallow lakes in the northern taiga zone. There was 157 spiders collected from the southern park of the park.

It was formed in 1958 and is based in Seymour Victoria. FGA's Mission Statement is: :Field & Game Australia is a voluntary organisation formed by hunters. We partner with government and the community in the management and sustainable utilisation of Australia's wetlands for future generations by protecting game habitats through conservation. We promote responsible firearm ownership, ethical hunting and clay target shooting. FGA has always been an advocate of \\"sustainable utilisation\\" as the best way to conserve the native flora and fauna of Australia. They believe that as hunters they understand the need for sustainable hunting. FGA volunteers undertake waterfowl counts each year to assist government wildlife managers obtain waterfowl population numbers and locations. These figures are not published but reported to the Hunting Advisory Committee. Over the years its members have built and organised the construction of thousands of nest boxes across Australia. They are monitored regularly, nesting numbers are recorded, and introduced species are removed. This work has been very successful in breeding birds and educating the wider community of the importance of wetlands and their native inhabitants.  History  The Victorian Field and Game Association was established in 1958 at Sale. The name comes from \\"field sportsmen\\" and \\"game management' abbreviated to \\"Field and Game'. Field and Game was formed by hunters who were concerned at the loss of wetland habitat for the game birds they loved to observe and hunt. Other resolutions adopted at that first meeting in 1958 were: *To develop Victorian facilities for game bird hunting by the promotion of game bird conservation and management projects. *To develop a greater public appreciation of the pleasures and values of game bird hunting. *To organise a deputation to the Chief Secretary seeking the establishment of a shooter's license to fund game conservation. FGA‚Äôs guiding principles and purposes as established more than 50 years ago are even more important and more relevant today. ''' Principles and Purposes''' Field and Game Australia (formerly the Victorian Field & Game Association) was pioneered by recreational Waterfowl Hunters who recognised that development of farmland after the Second World War was seriously encroaching on important wetlands, causing a rapid decline in waterfowl populations through the state of Victoria. The first Field and Game branch was established as a direct response to these concerns. At its first meeting the Association adopted the following motto which, up until recent times, appeared on all its letterheads: \\"The wildlife of today is not ours to dispose of as we please. We have it in trust. We must account for it to those who come after\\". ~ King George Vl ~'''''''''' Initially the Association concentrated its efforts on three wetlands of significance: Winton Swamp near Benalla (now Lake Mokoan) Tower Hill in Western Victoria and Jack Smith's Lake in Gippsland In those early days the Association appeared as radical in its aims as many contemporary conservation groups do today. This was because hunters placed a value on swampland, which because of its unsuitability for agriculture was otherwise regarded as being useless. Many in the community thought the FGA members odd in the 1950s when they proposed that regulated water from irrigation systems should be available to wetlands. Building Assets for all Australians Members of the Association lobbied strongly for the introduction of a shooter‚Äôs license system that would make funds available for the protection of wetland habitats. Under Sir Henry Bolte‚Äôs watchful eye, the Shooter's License was established in 1959 and provided Victoria‚Äôs first ever funds for game and wildlife management. Important areas of waterfowl habitat were purchased and the Game Research Station at Serindip near Lara was established ‚Äì now a popular wetland education centre. The shooters license raises over $4 million annually. A new Game License introduced in 1990 raises another $1 million annually. Recognition F&GA;'s efforts came in 1978 when the Association won the Conservation Council of Victoria's prestigious prize for the organisation that had contributed the most to conservation over a 5-year period.  Organisational structure  FGA has over 15,000 members, over 60 branches and 51 simulated field clay target shooting grounds throughout Australia. FGA volunteers spend many thousands of hours on a variety of activities, including wetland rehabilitation and management, shooter education, waterfowl identification courses (\\"WIT tests\\"), firearm safety and training, pest and vermin eradication, and organised duck hunts and fox drives. The individual branches are the members of the National Body. The branches' delegates vote at National meetings. Each branch is an incorporated association, with individual members being entitled to vote at Branch meetings. The current chairman of Field and Game Australia (National body) is Russell Bate. Its current Patrons include The Hon Malcolm Fraser (former Prime Minister), the Hon David Hawker (former Speaker of the House of Representatives) and scientist Dr Grahame Webb. Former the late Sir Henry Bolte, former Victorian Governor the late Sir Rohan Delacombe.  Legal issues  In 2009, Sale Field and Game spokesperson Gary Howard was found guilty in Sale Magistrates Court on the charges of taking and using water without authority, and with interfering with the flow in a waterway. Mr Howard was fined $1500 and ordered to pay costs of $1500. The Heart Morass adjoins Lake Wellington and water taken from the river was beneficial to the environment and did not deprive any other land users or downstream environments. The actions were uncovered by the Coalition Against Duck Shooting who monitored Heart Morass after learning that 100 Field and Game members had paid to hunt on the opening weekend. The police investigation showed that Mr Howard, who is on the committee of management for Heart Morass, had released water onto the property, owned by the Field and Game Association, just prior to the opening of the duck-hunting season, to attract ducks for better shooting conditions for paying members. In Victoria, following the 2011 duck season where an illegal protester was shot in the face by a shooter and in 2012 when other illegal protesters were charged and prosecuted, regulations were changed to increase public safety. New regulations were adopted in September 2012 and will be in place for the 2013 season. They incorporate what is known as \\"human safety regulations\\".  Advocacy of shooter's rights  Field and Game Australia represents members interests with government and legal submissions from time to time. In 2002 the FGA were represented in the High Court in relation to the Yorta Yorta Native Title claim over areas in the Goulburn and Murray Valleys. The Yorta Yorta claim was over 200,000 km2 of land. The Yorta Yorta people gave evidence that they traditionally used the land to camp, hunt and fish. FGA opposed the claim for exclusive possession as they also used the land to camp hunt and fish. In 2005‚Äì06, the Victorian Environmental Assessment Council proposed five new national parks (Barmah, Gunbower, Lower Goulburn, Warby Range-Ovens River, Leaghur-Koorangie and a significant addition to Murray-Sunset) and five new regional or other parks. This would have significantly reduced public access to public land currently used for camping, fishing and hunting. The proposal would have restricted boat access to rivers enjoyed by Victorians. VEAC's proposals were based on economic assumptions that were shown to be flawed. FGA engaged consultants to challenge the economic assumptions and VEAC's proposals were subsequently rejected by the Victorian Government. Members of Field and Game are included in an insurance scheme that provides them with $20 million public liability insurance and gun insurance.  Accomplishments  From 1963 to 1965, the VFGA vigorously opposed a proposal by the Victorian Government to drain the Hird and Johnson Wetlands near Kerang. Subsequent to their political victory, the organisation has worked to preserve these wetlands. In 1978, the VFGA won the Victorian Conservation Prize for \\"the defence of Victoria's wetlands, the preservation of wildlife habitat and development of public awareness\\". The prize is awarded annually to an organisation who has shown outstanding contributions to conservation over the previous five years. The prize was awarded by the Minister for Conservation, but since the 1980s that prize has been replaced by LandCare Awards. Research by the VFGA in Victoria during 1992‚Äì1993 showed that lead levels in Pacific black duck at Lake Buloke had reached internationally recognised levels dangerous to waterfowl (waterfowl ingest lead pellets with gravel ‚Äì the gravel aid their digestion of food). This prompted the VFGA to work with government and take a lead role the phase-out of lead shot for waterfowl hunting, which was completed in 2002. In 2001, FGA founded the Wetland Environmental Taskforce Public Fund (WET) to raise money to protect wetlands. WET has purchased the remaining Heart Morass wetlands from a private farm. Much of the wetland had been drained to create pastures. WET's purchase of the Heart Morass will protect it.

The national park is and the third-largest in Sweden. It is about above the Arctic Circle by the Norwegian border and lies north and south of the lake system of the Lule River. The area was declared a national park in 1909. The national park is part of the Laponian area, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Stora sj√∂fallet is also a part of Natura 2000, which is a network for protected areas in the European Union.  History  When the national park was created in 1909 the main reason was the great waterfall called Stour Muorkkeg√•rttje in the Sami languages. The great waterfalls at the heart of the park were historically among the most powerful and visually striking in Europe, but relatively soon after the area was given its protected status, the government permitted hydroelectric development of the falls, which deprived the sheer drop of most of its visible water flow except for a few times a year and damaged the shorelines of Akkajaure. Later developments in this part of the park include a power line, roads, and gravel banks. Already in the 1960s the status as national park was questioned due to these severe changes, and today the area of the falls is no longer a part of the national park. Today the lake Akkajaure, that divides the park into two, is artificial. The name of the park comes from a five-level waterfall on the Lule River. Each of the five levels is named after a man who has been important in the history of Lapland. The first is SG Hermelin (Hermelin's fall), who was a great entrepreneur in the industrial history of Norrbotten. Lars Levi Laestadius, the founder of Laestadianism, and D√ºben, doctor and author of the book Om lappland och lapparne, have also given their names to levels in the fall. The two last levels were named after Carl Anton Petterson, who presented the Stora sj√∂fallet to the Swedish people, and Henrik Adolf Widmark, who was strongly committed to the mountains of Lapland. The mountains were formed about 400 million years ago when two continents collided. The sea between them disappeared and the sediment of the seabed was pressed into a mountain range. There are still traces from the ice age in the area, for example terminal moraines and outcrops polished by the ice.  Geography  The part of the park south of the lake Akkajaure, which has been broken out of the park, is dominated by the mountain √Åhkk√°, which is also called \\"the queen of Lapland\\" or \\"Nils Holgersson's mountain\\" after Selma Lagerl√∂f's story. The lower hills in the south of the park are covered by forests of fir trees. North of the lake is the mountain Kallaktj√•kk√•, whose north face faces the narrow and deep Teusa-valley. The park's highest peak is above sea level and is a part of the mountain massif √Åhkk√°, which has thirteen peaks and ten glaciers. Global warming makes the glaciers melt each year.  Plants and animals  The flora is one of the reasons that the area became a national park. The bedrock is lime-poor, which has resulted in large areas covered with dwarf birch and crowberry. The park also has plenty of lichens and sj√∂fallskvartsiten or \\"the Sj√∂falls' sandstone\\" is unique for the park. Of the approximately 400 species of flora that can be found in the mountains, about half of them have been found in Stora sj√∂fallet national park. Arenaria humifusa is an example. Cloudberry, which is also called \\"the gold of Lapland\\", can be found in the park from the middle of July to the end of August. About 125 different species of birds have been observed in the park. Some common species are European golden plover, meadow pipit, and northern wheatear. Eurasian whimbrel, long- tailed jaeger, eagle, and rough-legged buzzard can also be seen and, with a bit of luck, the unusual species lesser white-fronted goose, gyrfalcon, and great grey owl can be observed. Sjaunja, the largest bird reserve in Sweden, borders to the park in the east. Mammals that one can catch sight of are reindeer, moose, red fox, ermine, and rabbit. Among these, the reindeer is the most common, and two Sami communities', S√∂rkaitum and Sirka, pastures are within the area. Rarer species that can also be observed are lynx, wolverine, Arctic fox, and brown bear. The large differences in altitude have resulted in large differences in the vegetation, for example old-growth forest, mountain birch forest, bare mountain, and boulder fields. In the hollows for example globe-flower and aconitum can be found, while the Ranunculus glacialis, snow bunting, and rock ptarmigan prefer higher altitudes.  Tourism  The lake K√•rtejaure and the stream Njabbej√•kk√• seen from the tree line above Suorva The national park is easiest to reach from the road from Porjus. The road passes Vietas and continues to the west end of the park. It is most appropriate to visit the park between March and September, but other periods work as well. Kungsleden passes through the northern part of the national park. In the south part of the park there are no trails or cabins. Some attractions are the Count and the Countess, the √Åhkk√° massif, the √Åhkk√° terraces, Seven sisters, and the Teusa valley. Cabins can be found in some parts of the park. Otherwise accommodation can be found in Vietas and at Stora Sj√∂fallet's mountain resort. Activities that are offered are fishing, skiing, snowmobiling, hiking, and ice climbing. There are special rules for people that visit the park. For example, it is forbidden to: * hunt, fish, or catch insects. * pick or dig up plants. * break branches or hurt living or dead trees and bushes. * collect minerals. * drive a motor vehicle outside special roads. * ride a horse or bring a dog (during some periods it is allowed to bring the dog if it is on a leash). * fly in valleys or lower than above the ground. However, gathering dead branches to make a fire or arrange protection is permitted. One may also pick berries and fungi.

banking that originated in prosperous Northern Italy, called Lombardy as a whole during the Middle Ages. The term was sometimes used in a derogatory sense, and some were accused of usury. History A Christian prohibition on profit from money without working made banking sinful. Though Pope Leo the Great forbade charging interest on loans by canon law, it was not forbidden to take collateral on loans. Pawn shops thus operate on the basis of a contract that fixes in advance the \\"fine\\" for not respecting the nominal term of the \\"interest free\\" loan, or alternatively, may structure a sale-repurchase by the \\"borrower\\", where the interest is implicit in the repurchase price. Similar conventions exist in modern Islamic banking. Various ways around the prohibition were devised, so that the lowly pawnshop contractors could bundle their risk and investment for larger undertakings. Christianity and Judaism generally ban usury, but allow usury towards those outside their faith. Thus Christians could lend to Jews and vice versa. The only real necessity for a young man who desired a future in the financial world of the Middle Ages was the ability to read and write; the methods used for bookkeeping were carefully kept within families and slowly spread along trade routes. Therefore, this knowledge was available most readily to Jesuits and Jews, who consequently played a major role in European finance. Later the Jesuits took the role of go-between with heads of state, while the Jews manned the low-end pawnshops. This explains the disproportionately large share of Jews in the goldsmith trade and early diamond market (diamonds being a lightweight alternative to gold). It comes as no surprise that the pawn shops of Rome were the most prosperous of all, especially in the 16th century under Popes Pius IV and Sixtus V. This Italian \\"Lombard\\" pawn shop method became famous. The use of the term \\"Lombard\\" for pawn shop grew slowly from city to city and became prevalent in Cahors, southern France, from where the Christian Cahorsins moved as far north as LondonMatthew of Paris: The Usury of the Cahorsins, 1235, Medieval Sourcebook. \\"In these days prevailed the horrible nuisance of the Caursines, to such a degree that there was hardly any one in all England, especially among the bishops, who was not caught in their net. Even the king himself was held indebted to them in an incalculable sum of money. For they circumvented the needy in their necessities, cloaking their usury under the show of trade, and pretending not to know that whatever is added to the principal is usury, under whatever name it may be called‚Ä¶\\" The sourcebook itself notes: \\"The Caursines (or Cahorsins) derived their name from the city of Cahors but the term is usually applied to money-lenders. The real Caursines were capitalist Christian bankers whose clients were the rich and powerful in society. In England their unpopularity was due to their officiating as papal brokers, and to the heavy rates of interest they charged.\\" and Amsterdam in the 13th century; at the latter, they were called Cahorsijnen, Cawarsini or Coarsini.Historical Archive De Groene Amsterdammer, 1877. 15th and 16th centuries In France the Lombards became synonymous with the Cahorsins. Most European cities still have a street named Lombard Street after the pawn shop that once resided there. In Dutch, the name for a pawn shop is still lommerd, and the same etymology persists in the names of various banks (unless named after some family). In Ukrainian, Polish and Russian, a pawn shop is called simply lombard. 17th and 18th centuries The near-monopoly position of the Lombards in finance became less prominent as various Protestant factions after the Reformation. In the 18th century many bankers and shipping agents were Quakers. Though the pawnshops were no longer manned by Jews and/or Jesuits, they were more and more often called Lombard houses, and most major port cities still have a \\"Lombard Street\\" or \\"Lombard Alley\\" today. American examples are San Francisco, New Orleans, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The term \\"Lombard\\" for pawnshop (or pawnshop owner) was in use well into the late 18th century, thus many of these streets were named with the establishment of shipping agents in those towns. Modern day The practice of Lombard credit is still commonly used in central banking, where central banks lend against marketable securities, such as government bonds. Modern repo (repurchase-sale transactions) are also forms of Lombard lending: one bank sells marketable securities to another (at a discount), with an agreement to repurchase the securities (typically at par) in a fixed period of time. Although the legal documentation of the transaction is that of a sale and subsequent repurchase, the substance of the transaction is a secured loan (and under most accounting standards, will be treated as a loan). Pawn shops in many countries and languages are often still referred to as Lombards.

He participated in every major event leading to the independent Lithuanian state and is often given the informal honorific title of the \\"Patriarch of the Nation\\" () for his contributions. Born to a family of farmers, Basanaviƒçius was to become a priest but instead chose to study medicine at the Moscow Medical Academy. He worked as a doctor from 1880 to 1905 in the Principality of Bulgaria. Despite the long distance, he dedicated substantial effort to the Lithuanian cultural work. He founded the first Lithuanian-language newspaper Au≈°ra (1883), contributed articles on Lithuania to the press, collected samples of Lithuanian folklore (songs, fairy-tales, legends, riddles, etc.) and published them. He was also involved with local Bulgarian politics. He returned to Lithuania in 1905 and immediately joined Lithuanian cultural life. He became chairman of the organizing committee of the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius. In 1907, he founded the Lithuanian Scientific Society, a learned society dedicated to Lithuanian history, ethnography, linguistics. Basanaviƒçius became chairman of the society and dedicated the rest of his life to its affairs. In 1917, he was elected by the Vilnius Conference to the Council of Lithuania. He chaired the council's session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918 and was the first to sign it. In the aftermath of World War I, Vilnius changed hands and regimes several times, but Basanaviƒçius refused to leave safeguarding city's museums, libraries, archives and continuing his lifelong research of Lithuanian cultural matters. After ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, Vilnius became part of Poland and Lithuanian activities were censored and limited. Basanaviƒçius' continued presence in the city became a symbol of Lithuanian claims to the bitterly contested Vilnius Region. When he died in 1927, the Lithuanian government declared a five-day mourning period. Early life and education Basanaviƒçius was born in the village of O≈ækabaliai () in the August√≥w Governorate of Congress Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire, to a family of Lithuanian farmers. His younger brother Vincas was born in 1861; other children died in childhood. Birth complications prompted his parents, devout Catholics, to pray and promise that they would educate their firstborn to be a priest. Keeping up with the promise, the parents supported a village tutor for local children. There Basanaviƒçius learned basic reading, writing, and arithmetic as well as serving the altar. He further attended an elementary school in Luk≈°iai. During that time Polish was regarded as the more prestigious language of the nobility and well educated people. Russian was used in state administration, while Lithuanian was used among the peasants. After the Uprising of 1863, Tsarist authorities implemented various Russification policies in an attempt to reduce the influence of Polish language and culture. One of such policies allowed Basanaviƒçius to attend Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. Before the uprising, a son of a Lithuanian could hardly expect to be admitted to a school catering to Polish nobility. Basanaviƒçius failed his first entrance examinations in 1865, but succeeded a year later. Basanaviƒçius developed appreciation for the Lithuanian language, culture, and history from local hill forts and his parents, who provided a loving treasure of local songs, legends, stories. This appreciation grew and deepened at the gymnasium where Basanaviƒçius got acquainted with classical authors of Lithuanian history (Maciej Stryjkowski, Alexander Guagnini, Jan D≈Çugosz, Marcin Kromer), studied Lithuanian folk songs, read classical poems The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis, Konrad Wallenrod by Adam Mickiewicz, Margier by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Syrokomla, and historical fiction by J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski. He drifted away from religion after reading a critical essay of Life of Jesus by Ernest Renan. Upon graduation in 1873, he managed to persuade his parents to allow him to attend Moscow University and not to send him to the Sejny Priest Seminary. Basanaviƒçius traveled to Moscow first to study history and philology, but after two semesters he transferred to the Moscow Medical Academy. Again, he benefited from the post-uprising Russification policies. He received one of ten fellowships (360 rubles annually) established for Lithuanian students from Congress Poland. He also supplemented his income by taking up private tutoring, but the living conditions were harsh and that had a lasting impact on his health. Basanaviƒçius actively participated in student affairs, followed developments in Lithuania, and continued his studies of Lithuanian heritage. Collecting data from Rumyantsev and university libraries, he hoped to write a study on Grand Duke Kƒôstutis. He usually spent his summers in Lithuania, collecting folk songs, fairytales, riddles. Medical career in Bulgaria After his graduation in spring 1879, Basanaviƒçius traveled back to Lithuania and had a few patients in O≈ækabaliai, Vilkavi≈°kis and Aleksotas. He returned to Moscow in October 1879 hoping to establish his private practice, but soon he accepted a lucrative proposal from the Principality of Bulgaria to become the head of a hospital in Lom Palanka, a town of about 8,000 inhabitants. After arrival in late January 1880, he found a run-down hospital located in a former hotel and energetically took measures to construct a new building, establish outpatient service, and combat perception that the hospital was a place to die rather than to get well. In 1880, the hospital had 522 inpatients and 1,144 outpatients compared to just 19 patients during 1879. The position paid well, expenses were low, so he was able to quickly repay debts and accumulate savings. Basanaviƒçius also wrote medical research articles, liberal political articles supporting Bulgarian politician Petko Karavelov, and cultural articles for Prussian Lithuanian press, including Til≈æƒós Keleivis and Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga, and academic journal Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft. However, these publications were too much under German control and did not satisfy growing needs of Lithuanian activists. Basanaviƒçius contemplated establishing a truly Lithuanian newspaper. A memorial plaque in Prague on the house where Basanaviƒçius lived After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in March 1881, Bulgarian Prince Alexander of Battenberg attempted to crack down on liberal politicians. Afraid of persecution, Basanaviƒçius left Bulgaria in May 1882. He traveled for several months, visiting Belgrade, Vienna, Lithuania, before settling down in Prague in December 1882. There he organized publication of Au≈°ra, the first Lithuanian-language newspaper. The first issue appeared in March 1883 and is often cited as the beginning of the Lithuanian National Revival. Basanaviƒçius directed the editorial policies, while Jurgis Mik≈°as handled printing in Ragnit in East Prussia. The newspaper then would be smuggled to Lithuania as publication in the Lithuanian language was illegal in the Russian Empire. Basanaviƒçius soon lost editorial control of Au≈°ra to Jonas ≈†li≈´pas. His involvement in an illegal publication prevented Basanaviƒçius from returning to Lithuania until 1905. Jonas Basanaviƒçius on 50 litas banknote, released in 2003 In Prague, Basanaviƒçius met Gabriela Eleonora Mohl, a Bohemian German, and they married in May 1884. Immediately after the wedding, the couple moved to Bulgaria, where political situation had improved. Basanaviƒçius first found a position in Elena, but managed to return to Lom Palanka in 1885. Life there was marked by a series of hardships. The Serbo- Bulgarian War brought a wave of war casualties to the hospital and a typhus epidemic. Basanaviƒçius became seriously ill with pneumonia and typhus in February 1886. In August 1887, he survived an assassination attempt, but one bullet remained logged under his left shoulder blade for the rest of his life and caused various health issues. His attacker, Alexander Manoilov, served a ten-year sentence but never fully explained his reasoning. On 16 February 1889, Mohl died of tuberculosis that she apparently contracted from her dying mother while still in Prague. The death of his wife sent Basanaviƒçius into depression and melancholy for almost a year. In 1891, Basanaviƒçius acquired Bulgarian citizenship and was promoted to Varna, a city of 25,000 residents, in 1892, but his health problems intensified. He suffered from arrhythmia, neurasthenia, neuralgia, paraesthesia. That prompted him to resign from public position in 1893 and limit his work to his private practice and palace visits to Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. When Nicholas II of Russia became the new Tsar in 1894, Basanaviƒçius petitioned to be allowed to return to Lithuania but was refused. Basanaviƒçius traveled to Austria several times searching for cures to his ailments. In 1900 he suffered a stroke and traveled to Vienna, where he had an X-ray taken which showed where the assassin's bullet was logged under the bones. Doctors refused to operate to extract it. Despite his ailments, Basanaviƒçius continued to work both on medical and ethnographic studies and even joined politics. In 1898, he was elected to the Bulgarian Literature Society. He traveled to East Prussia, where he campaigned on behalf of four Prussian Lithuanian candidates to the German Reichstag in the 1898 elections (Jonas Smalakys was elected). He also joined the Democratic Party and was elected to the Varna City Council from 1899 to 1903. He also participated in the party congresses and helped develop the party program on health care. However, his passion remained with Lithuanian language and culture. Despite the long distance, he collected Lithuanian tales and songs and published them in 1898‚Äì1905 in Lithuanian American presses in United States. Personally he thought that his most important work was the lifelong thesis that Lithuanians descended from Thracians and Phrygians and therefore were closely related to the Bulgarians. The thesis has not been accepted by other scholars. Return to Lithuania =Great Seimas of Vilnius= A statue in the Old Town of Vilnius, in front of the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Russia lost the Russo-Japanese War and became engulfed in the Revolution of 1905. In Lithuania, the press ban was lifted. Basanaviƒçius, after years of service, was entitled to receive a Bulgarian pension and considered this a good time to return to Lithuania even though he did not have a permission to return. He departed Bulgaria in May 1905 and arrived to Vilnius in August. Immediately he joined activities of Lithuanian activists and promoted the idea of a Lithuanian assembly which would become the Great Seimas of Vilnius. With help from the staff of Vilniaus ≈æinios, a fifteen-member organizing committee was formed and Basanaviƒçius became its chairman. In November 1905, in the name of the organizing committee Basanaviƒçius authored a controversial memorandum to Sergei Witte, Prime Minister of the Russian Empire, which demanded autonomy for Lithuania in the Russian Empire. Over 2,000 participants gathered on 4‚Äì5 December 1905 in Vilnius for the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Basanaviƒçius was elected as its chairman. After loud, passionate, and intense discussions, the Seimas adopted a four-paragraph resolution which declared Tsarist government as Lithuania's most dangerous enemy and demanded autonomy for Lithuania. The resolution also called for passive and peaceful resistance to Tsarist authorities, such as not paying taxes, organizing strikes, boycotting certain products, etc. The autonomy was not achieved and the Tsarist authorities soon reestablished their control, but it laid the groundwork for establishing the independent Lithuanian in 1918. Using the energy generated by the Seimas, Basanaviƒçius founded the Lithuanian National Democratic Party (), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania but it did not gain more prominence. As Tsarist authorities began investigating the Seimas and questioning its organizers, Basanaviƒçius decided to leave Vilnius and traveled to Saint Petersburg. There he approached Pavel Milyukov, leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party, but found little sympathy for the Lithuanian cause. When he returned in January 1906, the police was waiting for him and he considered fleeing the country, but his Bulgarian passport was expired. The authorities questioned him, but he was not jailed. He managed to renew his passport and even obtain a one-year permit to reside in Russia. Despite his ailments and recurring health problems, Basanaviƒçius wholeheartedly joined the election campaigns to the newly established State Duma of the Russian Empire, wrote extensively for Lithuanian press, campaigned for use of Lithuanian language in Catholic churches, continued his ethnographic research going through various archives and libraries. The issue of language in churches was particularly important to Basanaviƒçius. When Russian authorities expelled Eduard von der Ropp, Bishop of Vilnius, from Vilnius, Basanaviƒçius attempted to organize a delegation to Pope Pius X to convince the pope to replace Ropp with a Lithuanian bishop. That put Basanaviƒçius in sharp conflict with Polish clergy. Basanaviƒçius chaired a commission organizing the , which was held in January 1907 at Vilei≈°is Palace. =Lithuanian Scientific Society= Committee of the Lithuanian Scientific Society, 1911. Sitting, from left: Juozas Kairi≈´k≈°tis, Antanas Smetona, Augustas Niemi, Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Antanas Vilei≈°is and Jonas Vilei≈°is. Standing, from left: Juozas Balƒçikonis, Zigmas ≈Ωemaitis, Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka and Jurgis ≈†lapelis. On 7 April 1907, Basanaviƒçius, who contemplated establishing a learned society since the 1880s, formally opened the Lithuanian Scientific Society dedicated to studies of Lithuanian history and language. He was elected as the society's president and the society became the focus of his life. Basanaviƒçius was involved to such a degree that the society was virtually identical with his person. The society published scholarly journal Lietuvi≈≥ tauta (The Lithuanian Nation) which Basanaviƒçius edited. The society also established a library, archive, and museum. The society was not welcomed by Tsarist authorities, that monitored and restricted its activities. Basanaviƒçius campaigned for the National House, an official headquarters for the society. The society raised enough funds to buy a plot of land, but not enough to construct the house. The society and Basanaviƒçius were criticized by younger scholars as too old-fashioned while Christian clergy attacked it for being too secular, but established new standards and levels of quality of Lithuanian scholarship. The society organized exhibitions, two most prominent were in 1908 for the 25th anniversary of Au≈°ra and in 1914 for the 10th anniversary of the end of the Lithuanian press ban. The society wanted to publish Lithuanian textbooks, but could not find competent authors for the books. It also planned on publishing a Lithuanian encyclopedia, but editorial disputes and financial difficulties derailed the project. The society established a four-member commission (members were Jonas Jablonskis, Kazimieras B≈´ga, Juozas Balƒçikonis, and Jurgis ≈†lapelis) which was tasked with standardizing the Lithuanian language. After great debates, Joblonskis emerged as the leading linguist and his book on Lithuanian syntax was published by the society in 1911. The society actively campaigned against city plans to build a water tower on Gediminas Hill and further damage remains of the historic Vilnius Upper Castle; Basanaviƒçius personally traveled to Saint Petersburg to petition the issue. During its annual meeting in June 1913, the society decided to send a delegation to United States primarily to raise funds for the National House. It was decided that Basanaviƒçius should go and that Martynas Yƒças would accompany him. Basanaviƒçius hesitated, citing his health issues, but agreed. They visited Lithuanian American communities on the East Coast (New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and elsewhere). They were discouraged by lax manners of the Lithuanians, infighting between local communities, and attacks by socialists (for example, Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas wrote to Lithuanian American socialist press urging to boycott the donation drive). Basanaviƒçius deeply resented such attacks as to him loyalty to one's nation far outweighed loyalty to one's class or political views. In total, they visited 84 Lithuanian communities in 120 days and collected $23,799 from some 6,000 donors. The money was not enough to build the National House and it was lost in a Russian bank during World War I. The exhausting travel schedule further deteriorated Basanaviƒçius' frail health. Observers agreed that he became a lot more passive, more an observer than an active participant. Basanaviƒçius himself recognized that he had trouble speaking, remembering things, was overall weaker. He continued to join various committees and organizations, but he would not automatically become chairman. It seemed that his membership was in honor of his past services rather than in expectation of future accomplishments. =World War I= Jonas Basanaviƒçius reading the Act of Independence of Lithuania, depicted in the Lithuanian postage stamp (1938) At the outbreak of World War I, Basanaviƒçius was undergoing bladder treatment in Berlin and rushed to Vilnius before the borders closed. He spent the war in Vilnius trying to preserve and protect the holdings of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and organize refugee relief efforts via the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In September 1915, Germans took over Vilnius. Many Lithuanians evacuated deeper into Russia, but Basanaviƒçius remained in the city. Initially, the Ober Ost officials restricted Lithuanian activities and banned their press but became more lenient as the war progressed. Basanaviƒçius concerned himself with the cultural work; for example, he obtained new premises for the library of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in summer 1917 and defended Lithuanian priests who spoke against political activities of , administrator of the Vilnius Diocese. The Germans established the puppet Kingdom of Poland and Basanaviƒçius co-signed several memorandums to German officials informing them of Lithuanian aspirations. He participated in the Vilnius Conference and was elected to the 20-member Council of Lithuania, but his role was more honorary and ceremonial. He formally presented thanks to the German officials for allowing the conference and sent a letter to Pope Benedict XV, but was not one of the active officers of the proceedings. On 11 December 1917, the council adopted an act that was demanded by German Chancellor Georg von Hertling and that called for \\"a firm and perpetual bond of alliance\\" with Germany. Such concessions to the Germans created a rift in the council and four members ‚Äì Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka, Steponas Kairys, Stanis≈Çaw Narutowicz and Jonas Vilei≈°is ‚Äì resigned from the council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of 11 December, temporarily stepped down and Basanaviƒçius chaired the session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918. He was the first to sign the Act. =Later life= Historical Presidential Palace in Kaunas, Lithuania Between January 1919 and October 1920, Vilnius changed hands and political regimes several times, but Basanaviƒçius was little concerned with political turmoil and concentrated on cultural work. He worked with the communist regime of the short-lived Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, particularly the Commissar of Education Vaclovas Bir≈æi≈°ka, to obtain funds for the repairs of the history museum. After the city was captured by the Poles in April 1919, Polish officials harassed Lithuanian activists, confiscated the money advanced by the Soviets for the museum, raided premises of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in search for weapons, etc. Basanaviƒçius organized lectures, helped with Lithuanian schools, and continued his cultural research. Balancing between Lithuanian and Polish interests, he refused to participate in the opening of the Stefan Batory University. In early 1920, he once again had to relocate the Lithuanian Scientific Society as the premises granted by the German authorities were returned to previous owners. Tomb of Jonas Basanaviƒçius in Vilnius In May 1920, Basanaviƒçius together with Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka, , and Teofilius Juodvalkis traveled to Kaunas to attend the opening of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. Basanaviƒçius was greeted as an honored guest and met with many dignitaries and old friends. He also visited the native O≈ækabaliai before returning to Vilnius in early June. A month later, in July 1920, the city was captured by the Soviet Union and it was transferred to the Lithuanians according to the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty. But Poland recaptured the city in October 1920 during the staged ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny. Polish authorities limited the membership in the Lithuanian Scientific Society only to the residents of Poland. Polish censorship and restrictions caused great anxiety to Basanaviƒçius who feared that he might get arrested. His refusal to leave the city became a living symbol of the Lithuanian claims to the city. In July‚ÄìNovember 1924, Basanaviƒçius again visited Lithuania and received a hero's welcome. On 23 November, a day-long celebration with a special mass, concerts, and lectures for his 75th birthday was held in Kaunas. Basanaviƒçius fell in his home on 5 February 1927. He refused to go to a hospital until he completed certain writing. In the hospital he was diagnosed with bladder and lung infections that his body was failing to fight. On 16 February 1927, the 9th anniversary of Lithuania's independence, he discussed matters of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and expressed wishes to attend the independence celebrations. He died that day at 6:50 pm. The Lithuanian government declared five-day mourning and sent a 12-member delegation to his funeral. He was buried in Rasos Cemetery on 21 February.  Legacy  A street in Varna, Bulgaria was named Dr. Basanovich Street () in his honour. A memorial plaque on Panagyurishte Street, Varna, marks the location of former Basanaviƒçius residence. A memorial plaque was unveiled at Anglick√° 15, Vinohrady, Prague in December 2013. Basanaviƒçius collected Lithuanian folklore, such as songs, fairy-tales, and riddles, and published 14 books during his life. In 1993‚Äì2004, folklorists Leonardas Sauka and Kostas Aleksynas organized approximately 7,000 works of folklore collected by Basanaviƒçius and published them in the 15-volume Jonas Basanaviƒçius Folklore Library.

It is based at about 287 Kilometres from the state capital Bhubaneswar and 82 kilometres from the district headquarters of Baripada and about 73 kilometres from Jamshedpur. The Kharkhai (Suleipat) Dam and the Simlipal Tiger Reserve are the nearby local attraction at the approachable distance, attracting many foreign tourists here.This is a notable mining area of Odisha, comprises iron-ores from Gorumahisani, Badampahar, Suleipat mines.It is Mayurbhanj's second largest city after Baripada. Geography Rairangpur is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Rairangpur It has an average elevation of . History Rairangpur Garh erstwhile Bamanghaty was founded by King Madhabdas Narendra Mohapatra. In the year 1878, Bamanghaty was merged into Mayurbhanj State ruled by King Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo. Later in the year 1918, Rairangpur was officially named after Rairangpur Garh. On 24 April 1960 Rairangpur Notified Area of Council (NAC) was formed with 15 wards. And on 1 May 2014, Rairangpur Municipality was formed under the laws as per the Municipalities Act.1950 notification released by Government of Odisha. Demographics According to the 2011 Census of India, Rairangpur had a population of 47,294. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Rairangpur has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 65%. In Rairangpur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. Economy Rairangpur acts as a liaison centre between Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, Durgapur in West Bengal and the Iron Ore Mines in Gorumahisani, Badampahar and Suleipat. The steel factories of Tata and the surrounding area rely partly on the iron ores extracted from these mines. In addition to freight trains there is also a passenger train from Jamshedpur to Badampahar via Rairangpur. Rairangpur is surrounded by hills which are rich in iron ore mineral. The first iron ore mines of Asia were in Gorumahisani, Suleipat and Badampahar (mother mines of Tata Steel) are located here. The first ever trial for setting up of a \\"Ferro Vanadium Plant\\" was made by Mayurbhanj Maharaja during pre-independence days. Currently, thousands of tonnes of iron ore are exported out of the state on daily basis. The majority of the population is dependent on the paddy harvesting (farming) as either their main source or as an alternate source of income. The direct and indirect dependency of the economy of this place is largely influenced by the paddy harvesting. The same is again largely dependent on the annual rain fall during May‚ÄìSeptember. The Kharkhai (Suleipat) Dam and Bankbal Dam irrigate some of the cultivating lands and helps for the kharif harvesting. Rairangpur has the oldest and the largest \\"Sal Oil Extraction Plant\\" which has been closed since years. Sal seed is locally collected from the forest. The area suffers due to less attention in the political environment with few resources and funds allocated to it from government or private sources. Climate Transportation Rairangpur lies on the Tatanagar-Badampahar branch line of Indian Railways.

A label printer with built-in keyboard and display for stand-alone use (not connected to a separate computer) is often called a label maker. Label printers are different from ordinary printers because they need to have special feed mechanisms to handle rolled stock, or tear sheet (fanfold) stock. Common connectivity for label printers include RS-232 serial, Universal Serial Bus (USB), parallel, Ethernet and various kinds of wireless. Label printers have a wide variety of applications, including supply chain management, retail price marking, packaging labels, blood and laboratory specimen marking, and fixed assets management. Mechanisms Brother P-Touch 540 label printer Label printers use a wide range of label materials, including paper and synthetic polymer (\\"plastic\\") materials. Several types of print mechanisms are also used, including laser and impact, but thermal printer mechanisms are probably the most common. There are two common types of thermal printer. Direct thermal printers use heat sensitive paper (similar to thermal fax paper). Direct thermal labels tend to fade over time (typically 6 to 12 months); if exposed to heat, direct sunlight or chemical vapors, the life is shortened. Therefore, direct thermal labels are primarily used for short duration applications, such as shipping labels. On the other hand, thermal transfer printers use heat to transfer ink from ribbon onto the label for a permanent print. Some thermal transfer printers are also capable of direct thermal printing. Using a PVC vinyl can increase the longevity of the label life as seen in pipe markers and industrial safety labels found in much of the market place today. There are three grades of ribbon for use with thermal transfer printers. Wax is the most popular with some smudge resistance, and is suitable for matte and semi-gloss paper labels. Wax/resin is smudge resistant, suitable for semi-gloss paper and some synthetic labels. Resin alone is scratch and chemical resistant, suitable for coated synthetic labels. When printing on continuous label stock, there is a tendency for the print location to shift slightly from label to label. To ensure registration of the print area with the target media, many label printers use a sensor that detects a gap, notch, line or perforation between labels. This allows the printer to adjust the intake of label stock so that the print aligns correctly with the media. Types of label printers Label printer capabilities vary between home, corporate and industrial-oriented models. Desktop label printers are usually designed for light to medium-duty use with a roll of stock up to 4\\" wide. They are quiet and inexpensive. Commercial label printers can typically hold a larger roll of stock (up to 8\\" wide) and are geared for medium-volume printing. Industrial label printers are designed for heavy-duty, continuous operation in warehouses, distribution centers and factories. Additionally, industrial portable label printers are designed for heavy-duty operation on location. They are usually handheld and come with an industrial hard case. Examples of applications are labeling for electrical installations, construction sites, and production floors where there are no computers. RFID readers are specialized label printers that print and encode at the same time on RFID transponders (tags) enclosed in paper or printable synthetic materials. RFID tags need to have printed information for backwards compatibility with barcode systems, so human users can identify the tag. Label printer applicators are designed to automate the labeling process. These systems are common in manufacturing and warehousing facilities that require cases and pallets to be labeled for shipping. Labelling software runs on a general-purpose personal computer, and is designed to create and/or format labels for printing. The software can use native OS printer drivers, or embed drivers in the software, bypassing the OS print subsystem. It may work with dedicated label printers as described in this article, or use sheet- or continuous-fed labels in a general-purpose computer printer. thumb Personal label printers or label makers are handheld or small desktop devices. They are intended for home office and small business use. The cost of these printers is generally very low, making them popular with low volume users; but they print on special tapes, often thermal, which are usually expensive. In the past, mechanical systems which worked by embossing a colored plastic tape, called embossing tape, were common. A hammer in the shape of the letter caused a letter-shaped extrusion on the opposite side of the tape. The raised plastic would discolor, providing visual contrast. Today, this type has been almost completely displaced by electronic thermal transfer devices with built-in keyboard and display, and an integrated cartridge containing the label material (and print ribbon, if used).

The game features a mixture of puzzle-solving, exploration, and dynamic combat mechanics, in which players must explore various islands in the search for the fabled weapons belonging to the gods of Norse mythology. The game received favourable reviews upon its release, though the console version was given mixed feedback by reviewers. A sequel to the game, entitled Heimdall 2, was developed by the same group and released three years later in 1994. Gameplay Players begin a new game by controlling the lead character Heimdall through a series of arcade-style trials - axe-tossing (cutting a maid's braids); boar hunting; and fighting on a ship - which influence the character's stats and the crew members they can choose to use during a playthrough. After completing the trials, the player then choose five characters to form a crew with alongside the main character. While Heimdall falls under the class of \\"Chieftain\\", the others fall under Viking-styled classes - Warrior, Wizard, Shipwright, Navigator, Druid, Blacksmith and Berserker - who each differ in stats and skills. Each class has their own strength - while warrior's make good melee fighters, wizards can cast spells more efficiently and identify scrolls and items more proficiently, whilst navigators can alert the player if their travel to another island might damage the party. The most critical stat of characters is energy - while this can be replenished by eating food, any character who loses all their energy is dead and must be revived by magic. The game features three modes - Navigation Map, Island Exploration, and Combat. Island Exploration is conducted via an isometric perspective, in which the player explores an island through different rooms. Players can take only Heimdall and two crew members with them onto the island, and can only leave the island by the entry point they came in by. Most islands have a range of traps - pits, spikes and arrows - that can damage the player, along with various monsters based on Norse mythology. In addition, players can acquire weapons, scrolls, gold, food and various other items from either combat, treasure chests or just lying around. Some islands feature NPCs who can be interacted with, some of whom act as shops where players can buy or sell items. Combat begins when the player interacts with monsters at their current location, though some are triggered by moving past a point. In combat, the player must reduce an enemy's energy to zero, while avoiding the same with their party. Only one character can fight, who can use various weapons such as bare knuckles, swords, axes, and throwing daggers to do damage, use spells, defend against attacks, or flee from combat. Attacks are done in real-time, and what weapons and spells can be used depends on what each character possess in their inventory. If a player completes a battle, they may earn a prize from their opponent. The Navigation Map focuses on moving around the current game world the player is in, based on the main quest they are conducting. In this mode, players can rearrange their crew to denote who explores the island with Heimdall, as well as rearrange a party's inventory. Travelling between islands requires the player to choose a location they can reach from their current position - to reach a distant shore, players must move to an island that connects to it, but can decide whether to explore an island or continue travelling. The game features three major world maps to explore, each connected to a main quest to complete. Plot The game begins with the Norse god Loki stealing Odin's sword, Freyr's spear and Thor's hammer and hiding them within the mortal world of the Vikings. Left powerless by his trickery, the gods decide to create an infant amongst the mortals who can bring back their weapons. In a small village of Vikings, a young woman finds herself magically pregnant with god's destined offspring, and gives birth to Heimdall. Upon growing to adulthood and completing a series of trials. Heimdall begins his search for the gods' weapons. In doing so, he explores the realms of Utgard, Midgard and Asgard, overcoming traps and monsters and eventually returns home with the missing weapons. Upon returning to his village, the gods bring him to them, and anoint him as one of their own for returning their power to them. Reception Computer Gaming World stated that only those new to role-playing games would enjoy Heimdall, while given the existence of more sophisticated games, \\"Experienced players will find a search for their car-keys somewhat more rewarding than this exercise\\". Reviewer Gary Whitta gave the Amiga version a score of 895 (out of a possible 1000), praising its mix of gameplay styles, cartoon-like graphics and longevity.Whitta, Gary (December 1991). Heimdall. ACE (UK magazine published by EMAP), p. 50-55. Reviewing the Sega CD version, GamePro commented that the graphics are mediocre during exploration and puzzle-solving but better in the combat view, and that the music is \\"unobtrusive\\" but substandard for a CD game. Like Computer Gaming World, they deemed it an RPG for beginners rather than experienced fans of the genre.

In the application of Lorentzian geometry to the physics of general relativity, a Cauchy surface is usually interpreted as defining an \\"instant of time\\"; in the mathematics of general relativity, Cauchy surfaces are important in the formulation of the Einstein equations as an evolutionary problem. They are named for French mathematician Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) due to their relevance for the Cauchy problem of general relativity.  Informal introduction  Although it is usually phrased in terms of general relativity, the formal notion of a Cauchy surface can be understood in familiar terms. Suppose that humans can travel at a maximum speed of 20 miles per hour. This places constraints, for any given person, upon where they can reach by a certain time. For instance, it is impossible for a person who is in Mexico at 3 o'clock to arrive in Libya by 4 o'clock; however it is possible for a person who is in Manhattan at 1 o'clock to reach Brooklyn by 2 o'clock, since the locations are ten miles apart. So as to speak semi-formally, ignore time zones and travel difficulties, and suppose that travelers are immortal beings who have lived forever. The system of all possible ways to fill in the four blanks in defines the notion of a causal structure. A Cauchy surface for this causal structure is a collection of pairs of locations and times such that, for any hypothetical traveler whatsoever, there is exactly one location and time pair in the collection for which the traveler was at the indicated location at the indicated time. There are a number of uninteresting Cauchy surfaces. For instance, one Cauchy surface for this causal structure is given by considering the pairing of every location with the time of 1 o'clock (on a certain specified day), since any hypothetical traveler must have been at one specific location at this time; furthermore, no traveler can be at multiple locations at this time. By contrast, there cannot be any Cauchy surface for this causal structure that contains both the pair (Manhattan, 1 o'clock) and (Brooklyn, 2 o'clock) since there are hypothetical travelers that could have been in Manhattan at 1 o'clock and Brooklyn at 2 o'clock. There are, also, some more interesting Cauchy surfaces which are harder to describe verbally. One could define a function œÑ from the collection of all locations into the collection of all times, such that the gradient of œÑ is everywhere less than 1/20 hours per mile. Then another example of a Cauchy surface is given by the collection of pairs :\\\\Big{\\\\big(p,\\\\tau(p)\\\\big):p\\\\text{ a location on earth}\\\\Big}. The point is that, for any hypothetical traveler, there must be some location which the traveler was at at time ; this follows from the intermediate value theorem. Furthermore, it is impossible that there are two locations and and that there is some traveler who is at at time and at at time , since by the mean value theorem they would at some point have had to travel at speed , which must be larger than \\"20 miles per hour\\" due to the gradient condition on œÑ: a contradiction. The physical theories of special relativity and general relativity define causal structures which are schematically of the above type (\\"a traveler either can or cannot reach a certain spacetime point from a certain other spacetime point\\"), with the exception that locations and times are not cleanly separable from one another. Hence one can speak of Cauchy surfaces for these causal structures as well.  Mathematical definition and basic properties  Let be a Lorentzian manifold. One says that a map is an inextendible differentiable timelike curve in if: * it is differentiable * is timelike for each in the interval * does not approach a limit as increases to or as decreases to .One is requiring that for all points in , there exists an open neighborhood of and a sequence which increases to and a sequence decreasing to such that and are not contained in for any . This definition makes sense even if only has the structure of a topological space. A subset of is called a Cauchy surface if every inextendible differentiable timelike curve in has exactly one point of intersection with ; if there exists such a subset, then is called globally hyperbolic. The following is automatically true of a Cauchy surface : It is hard to say more about the nature of Cauchy surfaces in general. The example of :\\\\Big{(t,x,y,z):t^2=\\\\frac{x^2+y^2+z^2}{2}\\\\Big} as a Cauchy surface for Minkowski space makes clear that, even for the \\"simplest\\" Lorentzian manifolds, Cauchy surfaces may fail to be differentiable everywhere (in this case, at the origin), and that the homeomophism may fail to be even a -diffeomorphism. However, the same argument as for a general Cauchy surface shows that if a Cauchy surface is a -submanifold of , then the flow of a smooth timelike vector field defines a -diffeomorphism , and that any two Cauchy surfaces which are both -submanifolds of will be -diffeomorphic. Furthermore, at the cost of not being able to consider arbitrary Cauchy surface, it is always possible to find smooth Cauchy surfaces (Bernal & S√°nchez 2003): Cauchy developments Let be a time-oriented Lorentzian manifold. One says that a map is an past-inextendible differentiable causal curve in if: * it is differentiable * is either future-directed timelike or future-directed null for each in the interval * does not approach a limit as decreases to One defines a future-inextendible differentiable causal curve by the same criteria, with the phrase \\"as decreases to \\" replaced by \\"as increases to \\". Given a subset of , the future Cauchy development of is defined to consist of all points of such that if is any past-inextendible differentiable causal curve such that for some in , then there exists some in with . One defies the past Cauchy development by the same criteria, replacing \\"past-inextendible\\" with \\"future-inextendible\\". Informally: The Cauchy development is the union of the future Cauchy development and the past Cauchy development.  Discussion  When there are no closed timelike curves, D^{+} and D^{-} are two different regions. When the time dimension closes up on itself everywhere so that it makes a circle, the future and the past of \\\\mathcal{S} are the same and both include \\\\mathcal{S}. The Cauchy surface is defined rigorously in terms of intersections with inextensible curves in order to deal with this case of circular time. An inextensible curve is a curve with no ends: either it goes on forever, remaining timelike or null, or it closes in on itself to make a circle, a closed non-spacelike curve. When there are closed timelike curves, or even when there are closed non-spacelike curves, a Cauchy surface still determines the future, but the future includes the surface itself. This means that the initial conditions obey a constraint, and the Cauchy surface is not of the same character as when the future and the past are disjoint. If there are no closed timelike curves, then given \\\\mathcal{S} a partial Cauchy surface and if D^{+}(\\\\mathcal{S})\\\\cup \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\cup D^{-}(\\\\mathcal{S}) = \\\\mathcal{M}, the entire manifold, then \\\\mathcal{S} is a Cauchy surface. Any surface of constant t in Minkowski space- time is a Cauchy surface.  Cauchy horizon  If D^{+}(\\\\mathcal{S})\\\\cup \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\cup D^{-}(\\\\mathcal{S}) ot= \\\\mathcal{M} then there exists a Cauchy horizon between D^{\\\\pm}(\\\\mathcal{S}) and regions of the manifold not completely determined by information on \\\\mathcal{S}. A clear physical example of a Cauchy horizon is the second horizon inside a charged or rotating black hole. The outermost horizon is an event horizon, beyond which information cannot escape, but where the future is still determined from the conditions outside. Inside the inner horizon, the Cauchy horizon, the singularity is visible and to predict the future requires additional data about what comes out of the singularity. Since a black hole Cauchy horizon only forms in a region where the geodesics are outgoing, in radial coordinates, in a region where the central singularity is repulsive, it is hard to imagine exactly how it forms. For this reason, Kerr and others suggest that a Cauchy horizon never forms, instead that the inner horizon is in fact a spacelike or timelike singularity. The inner horizon corresponds to the instability due to mass inflation. A homogeneous space-time with a Cauchy horizon is anti-de Sitter space.

He was best known for the BBC television series The Great Egg Race.  Early life  Wolff was born in Berlin. His father, Oswald Wolff, was a volunteer in World War I and a publisher specializing in German history. His mother, Margot Wolff (n√©e Saalfeld) died \\"of an acute heart infection\\" in 1938. Father and son fled to the Netherlands in August 1939, and then arrived as Jewish refugees in Britain on 3 September 1939, on the same day that World War II was declared by Britain and France; Wolff was 11. He was educated at the City of Oxford High School for Boys. Career Wolff worked in haematology at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford under Robert Gwyn Macfarlane, where he invented a machine for counting patients' blood cells, before joining the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit at Llandough Hospital near Cardiff. He went on to University College London (UCL), where he gained a first class honours degree in physiology and physics. Before going to UCL, he had been considered by Trinity College, Cambridge, but was rejected twice because his understanding of Latin was too weak. He spent much of his early career in bioengineering, a term he coined in 1954 to take account of then recent advances in physiology. He became an honorary member of the European Space Agency in 1975, and in 1983 he founded the Brunel Institute for Bioengineering, which was involved in biological research during weightless spaceflight. Following retirement, he was emeritus professor of bioengineering at Brunel University, working on a project aimed at addressing the care needs of older people. Wolff was the scientific director and co- founder of Project Juno, the private British-Soviet joint venture which sent Helen Sharman to the Mir space station. He is credited with the invention of the gel pad electrodes used in ECGs. Popular science A familiar face in the 1970s and early 1980s, well known to British television audiences with his memorable bow tie and pronounced German accent, his best remembered programme is probably The Great Egg Race. He was also the presenter of Great Experiments, and presenter/judge of the annual Young Scientists of the Year series. In 1985 he was a contestant on The Adventure Game. In 1998 Professor Wolff was one of the first people to be interviewed by Ali G, during that character's initial appearances on The 11 O'Clock Show, where the discussion ranged from elementary particles to penis enlargement. Also in 1989 he appeared on After Dark with, among others, astronaut Buzz Aldrin. In 2007 Wolff made a guest appearance on Channel 4's Comedy Lab episode \\"Karl Pilkington: Satisfied Fool\\", where he is seen explaining to Pilkington the sudden rise of intelligence in Homo sapiens. In March 2009, he appeared in the puzzle video game Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity. Lectures In 1975 he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on Signals from the Interior. In 2005 he presented the Higginson Lecture at Durham University. Personal life In 1953, he married Joan Stephenson, a staff nurse originally from Cardiff, whom he met at work. They lived in north London. Widowed in October 2014, he died from heart failure on 15 December 2017. He is survived by his two sons, Anthony and Laurence.

Early life Mosin was born in Ramon, in the Voronezh Governorate of the Russian Empire in 1849. He entered into a military academy at age 12 where he excelled as a young officer. In 1867, he entered the Alexandrovskoye Military High School in Moscow. Upon leaving Alexandrovskoye in 1870, he decided to go to the artillery branch and transferred to the Mikhailovskoye Artillery Academy. He graduated in 1875 and transferred to the Tula Arsenal where he became the head of the machining division. Mosin‚ÄìNagant Monument to Mosin in Sestroretsk, Russia. It was at Tula where Mosin began his career as a weapons designer by first making improvements to the Berdan II and later collaborating with Nagant to design the Rifle of Three Lines of the Year 1891. Some details in Mosin's rifle were borrowed from L√©on Nagant's design. One such detail is the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate. In Mosin's original design the spring was not attached to the base plate and, according to the Commission, could be lost during cleaning. Another detail is the form of the clip that could hold five cartridges to be loaded simultaneously into the magazine. Another detail is the form of the \\"interrupter\\", a specially designed part within the receiver, which helps prevent double feeding. The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant's rifle. Mosin eventually rose to the rank of Major General and was appointed as the director of the Sestroretsk arsenal. He died on February 8, 1902 and was buried in Sestroretskoye Cemetery in St. Petersburg Sestroretsk.

He served in the Austro- Hungarian Army before joining the Polish Legions in World War I and later the Polish Army. During the German Invasion of Poland he commanded Independent Operational Group Polesie (). He never lost a battle in the Invasion of Poland, although he was eventually forced to surrender after his forces ran out of ammunition. Imprisoned in Oflag IV-B Koenigstein, he died in hospital in Dresden on 5 April 1941 and was buried there. Early life General Franciszek Kleeberg was born on February 1, 1888 in Tarnopol (then part of Austro-Hungarian Empire). He was of German and Swedish ancestry on his paternal side. His father, an officer of the Austrian Dragoons, took part in the Polish uprising of 1863/64. After the fall of the uprising he returned home, and according to the family legend said: Now the country, Poland, will need good soldiers. 'Franek' will be a soldier. After graduation from the military vocational school at Hranice (M√§hrisch Wei√ükirchen) in Moravia, Kleeberg continued studies at military academy in M√∂dling, Lower Austria. Promoted to the 2nd Lieutenant in artillery, he served in the capital Vienna, where he completed studies at the Academy of the General Staff (k.u.k. Kriegsschule). War experience He took part in the First World War, first in the Austro-Hungarian army, and after May 1915 as an officer in the Polish Legion. He commanded a regiment in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919-21. In 1925 he completed studies at a French military school in Paris and became the commander of the Supreme Military School in Warsaw. After Jozef Pilsudski's coup d'√©tat, he was dismissed from that post in 1927 and sent to command an infantry division in Grodno. =World War II= At the time of the outbreak of World War II he was the commander of the IX Army Corps in Brzesc in the rear operational zone. Yet soon the situation changed in view of massive enemy air raids and rapid advance of its armoured and mechanized troops. On 11 September 1939 his corps were transformed into the Operation Group Polesie, but were lacking in heavy equipment, and on by 14 September were already in combat with the most advanced German troops. General Kleeberg managed to organize a defence by withdrawing dispersed units from under the strike of the German forces, but found many of his units also attacked by the Red army. He also managed to gather remnants of the Polish forces destroyed in the east to Vistula and south-east to Narew into a new grouping, with which he tried to break through towards besieged Warsaw. After hearing of Warsaw's capitulation, he dug his troops in, resulting in the battle of Kock; on 5 October General Kleeberg decided to surrender, as his forces were out of ammunition and food. Death General Kleeberg was imprisoned in Oflag IV-B Koenigstein, where he lost his sight and became unable to walk. He died in the camp hospital and was buried in Dresden. In 1969 his remains were exhumed, brought to Poland and re- buried in Kock among the fallen soldiers of the Operation Group Polesie.

The film is an earnest attempt at a B movie and an homage to the genre. While the main plot of the film is related to zombies, the film also mixes in takes on slashers and alien invasion films. Night of the Creeps did not perform well at the box office, but it developed a cult following. Plot In 1959, on board a spacecraft, two aliens race to keep an experiment from being released by a third member of the crew. The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. It lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe- wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small slug-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. Twenty-seven years later in 1986, Chris Romero pines over a love lost, supported by his disabled friend J.C. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and falls instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides to join a fraternity. Cynthia's boyfriend, who heads the Beta Epsilon fraternity, tasks them with stealing a cadaver from the university medical center and depositing it on the steps of a rival fraternity house. Chris and J.C. find a frozen corpse in a secret room, but when it grabs them, they flee. The thawed corpse then kills a medical student working at the lab. Detective Ray Cameron, a haunted cop, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in, where he discovers one of the bodies ‚Äì the boy who discovered the alien experiment in 1959 ‚Äì is now missing, set free by Chris and J.C. The corpse makes its way back to the sorority house where he picked up his date twenty-seven years ago. There, his head splits open and releases more of the slugs. Called to the scene, Det. Cameron finds the body, interpreting the condition of the head as the result of an axe wound in the face. The next day, the fraternity brothers confront Chris and J.C., who they believe to be responsible for the previous night's incident. They are then taken in for questioning by the police. Based on the testimony of a janitor that witnessed them running out of the university medical center, \\"screaming like banshees,\\" they confess to breaking in but deny moving the corpse. That night, the dead medical student rises from his slab and runs into the janitor. Cynthia attempts to convince Chris and J.C. that the attacks are zombie-related, but they are skeptical. When J.C. sees Cynthia leaning on Chris' shoulder, J.C. leaves the two alone and is attacked by the slugs that emerge from the possessed janitor. After Chris walks Cynthia back to the sorority house, he runs into Detective Cameron, who has overheard their conversation. At his house, Detective Cameron explains to Chris that the escaped lunatic's 1959 victim was his ex-girlfriend, and that he secretly hunted down and killed the axe-murderer in revenge. After Detective Cameron reveals that he buried the body under what is now the sorority house, he gets a call that the same axe-wielding lunatic has killed the house mother. Detective Cameron blows off the corpse's head with his shotgun, which releases more slugs. The next night, while everyone prepares for a formal dance, Chris finds a recorded message that J.C. posthumously left for him. J.C. says that the slugs have incubated in his brain, but he has discovered that they are susceptible to heat. Chris recruits Detective Cameron, who was in the midst of a suicide attempt, and they retrieve a flamethrower from the police armory. They arrive at the sorority house just as Cynthia breaks up with Brad, who has become possessed. After killing him, the Beta fraternity brothers show up, despite having been killed in a bus crash. Cynthia and Chris team up to destroy the outside zombies, and Detective Cameron clears the house. After they stop the horde, Chris spots more slugs racing toward the basement; Cynthia explains that a member of the sorority had received specimen brains for biology class. In the basement, they find an enormous pile of slugs, and Detective Cameron, tape across his mouth, prepping a can of gasoline. Detective Cameron begins counting down as he splashes gasoline and Chris counts down in sync with him as he and Cynthia race out of the house. As Cameron opens up the house's gas valve, several slugs leap to attack him. He flicks his lighter and the house goes up in a fiery explosion. Chris and Cynthia share a kiss as they watch the house burn. =Endings= The film has two endings, one of which was used for the film's theatrical release and the other is the ending originally intended by director Fred Dekker. In the theatrical version, the dog who caused the bus accident returns and approaches Cynthia. As Cynthia bends down toward it, the dog opens its mouth and a slug jumps out toward her. The original ending shows Chris and Cynthia standing in front of the burning sorority house, with the camera moving to the street where police cars race towards the burning building. The police cars race by the charred and 'zombified' Cameron who is shuffling down the street, still smoking a cigarette, when he suddenly stops and falls to the ground. His head then bursts open, with the slugs that incubated inside his brain scamper out and slither towards a nearby cemetery, suggesting the slugs have found new hosts to inhabit. Searchlights appear from the night sky, revealing the source to be the spaceship from the beginning of the film, with the aliens intending to retrieve their experiment. This ending is featured on most home media releases and television broadcasts. Cast The characters' names are homages to horror directors. Production Director Fred Dekker originally wanted to shoot the film in black and white. He included every B movie cliche he could think of and insisted on directing the script himself. Most of the main characters (Romero, Carpenter, Raimi, Hooper, Cronenberg) are named after horror movie makers. The script was written in a week. Soundtrack The soundtrack album, featuring Barry DeVorzon's score for the film (except tracks 22-26), was issued in 2009 by La-La Land Records.

He was one of the members of the \\"Forl√¨ painting school\\". Peter of Aragon gives kingdom to Pope Innocent III (fresco, Sala Regia of the Vatican Palace). Biography Initially a pupil of Francesco Menzocchi, in 1535 he painted the frescoes of the Eucharist and the Prophets for the Chapel of the Sacrament in Forl√¨ Cathedral, now in the local art gallery, the Pinacoteca Civica di Forl√¨. In 1539, he painted in the Church of Santa Maria dei Servi. In 1542, he travelled to Ravenna, where he painted the canvas of Bishops now kept in Ariani Cathedral. He joined the Roman Accademia di San Luca in 1534.Date in question. In 1544, he painted the frescoes of allegorical figures in the Sala Paolina of the Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo in Rome, under the supervision of Perin del Vaga. Agresti also helped decorate the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome. In 1555-6, he decorated the Gonzaga Chapel in the Church of Santo Spirito in Sassia with biblical scenes, and returned in 1574 to decorate the Chapel of the Trinity with more scenes from the New Testament. The most recently discovered work of Agresti came to light in June 2009 in Cesena Cathedral, an oil on copper in depicting the patron saint of the city, Saint John the Baptist, assigned to the old master by Alex Cavallucci. The Church of St John Maddermarket in Norwich has a large oil canvas of The Last Supper which, although attributed to Agresti, has no verifiable provenance.

Video processing systems may introduce some amount of distortion or artifacts in the video signal, which negatively impacts the user's perception of a system. For many stakeholders such as content providers, service providers, and network operators, the assurance of video quality is an important task. Video quality evaluation is performed to describe the quality of a set of video sequences under study. Video quality can be evaluated objectively (by mathematical models) or subjectively (by asking users for their rating). Also, the quality of a system can be determined offline (i.e., in a laboratory setting for developing new codecs or services), or in-service (to monitor and ensure a certain level of quality). From analog to digital video Since the world's first video sequence was recorded and transmitted, many video processing systems have been designed. Such systems encode video streams and transmit them over various kinds of networks or channels. In the ages of analog video systems, it was possible to evaluate the quality aspects of a video processing system by calculating the system's frequency response using test signals (for example, a collection of color bars and circles). Digital video systems have almost fully replaced analog ones, and quality evaluation methods have changed. The performance of a digital video processing and transmission system can vary significantly and depends, amongst others, on the characteristics of the input video signal (e.g. amount of motion or spatial details), the settings used for encoding and transmission, and the channel fidelity or network performance. Objective video quality Objective video quality models are mathematical models that approximate results from subjective quality assessment, in which human observers are asked to rate the quality of a video. In this context, the term model may refer to a simple statistical model in which several independent variables (e.g. the packet loss rate on a network and the video coding parameters) are fit against results obtained in a subjective quality evaluation test using regression techniques. A model may also be a more complicated algorithm implemented in software or hardware. = Terminology = The terms model and metric are often used interchangeably in the field. However a metric has certain mathematical properties, which, by strict definition, do not apply to all video quality models. The term ‚Äúobjective‚Äù relates to the fact that, in general, quality models are based on criteria that can be measured objectively ‚Äì that is, free from human interpretation. They can be automatically evaluated by a computer program. Unlike a panel of human observers, an objective model should always deterministically output the same quality score for a given set of input parameters. Objective quality models are sometimes also referred to as instrumental (quality) models, in order to emphasize their application as measurement instruments. Some authors suggest that the term ‚Äúobjective‚Äù is misleading, as it ‚Äúimplies that instrumental measurements bear objectivity, which they only do in case that they can be generalized.‚Äù = Classification of objective video quality models = Classification of objective video quality models into Full-Reference, Reduced-Reference and No-Reference. No- reference image and video quality assessment methods. Objective models can be classified by the amount of information available about the original signal, the received signal, or whether there is a signal present at all: * Full Reference Methods (FR): FR models compute the quality difference by comparing the original video signal against the received video signal. Typically, every pixel from the source is compared against the corresponding pixel at the received video, with no knowledge about the encoding or transmission process in between. More elaborate algorithms may choose to combine the pixel-based estimation with other approaches such as described below. FR models are usually the most accurate at the expense of higher computational effort. As they require availability of the original video before transmission or coding, they cannot be used in all situations (e.g., where the quality is measured from a client device). * Reduced Reference Methods (RR): RR models extract some features of both videos and compare them to give a quality score. They are used when all the original video is not available, or when it would be practically impossible to do so, e.g. in a transmission with a limited bandwidth. This makes them more efficient than FR models at the expense of lower accuracy. * No-Reference Methods (NR): NR models try to assess the quality of a distorted video without any reference to the original signal. Due to the absence of an original signal, they may be less accurate than FR or RR approaches, but are more efficient to compute. ** Pixel-Based Methods (NR-P): Pixel-based models use a decoded representation of the signal and analyze the quality based on the pixel information. Some of these evaluate specific degradation types only, such as blurring or other coding artifacts. ** Parametric/Bitstream Methods (NR-B): These models make use of features extracted from the transmission container and/or video bitstream, e.g. MPEG-TS packet headers, motion vectors and quantization parameters. They do not have access to the original signal and require no decoding of the video, which makes them more efficient. In contrast to NR-P models, they have no access to the final decoded signal. However, the picture quality predictions they deliver are not very accurate. ** Hybrid Methods (Hybrid NR-P-B): Hybrid models combine parameters extracted from the bitstream with a decoded video signal. They are therefore a mix between NR-P and NR-B models. = Use of picture quality models for video quality estimation = Some models that are used for video quality assessment (such as PSNR or SSIM) are simply image quality models, whose output is calculated for every frame of a video sequence. This quality measure of every frame can then be recorded and pooled over time to assess the quality of an entire video sequence. While this method is easy to implement, it does not factor in certain kinds of degradations that develop over time, such as the moving artifacts caused by packet loss and its concealment. A video quality model that considers the temporal aspects of quality degradations, like VQM or the MOVIE Index, may be able to produce more accurate predictions of human-perceived quality. = Examples =  No- reference metrics  An overview of recent no-reference image quality models has been given in a journal paper by Shahid et al. As mentioned above, these can be used for video applications as well. No-reference, pixel-based quality models designed specifically for video are however rare, with Video-BLIINDS being one example. The Video Quality Experts Group has a dedicated working group on developing no-reference metrics (called NORM).  Simple full- reference metrics  The most traditional ways of evaluating quality of digital video processing system (e.g. a video codec) are FR-based. Among the oldest FR metrics are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are calculated between every frame of the original and the degraded video signal. PSNR is the most widely used objective image quality metric, and the average PSNR over all frames can be considered a video quality metric. PSNR is also used often during video codec development in order to optimize encoders. However, PSNR values do not correlate well with perceived picture quality due to the complex, highly non-linear behavior of the human visual system.  More complex full- or reduced-reference metrics  With the success of digital video, a large number of more precise FR metrics have been developed. These metrics are inherently more complex than PSNR, and need more computational effort to calculate predictions of video quality. Among those metrics specifically developed for video are VQM and the MOVIE Index. Based on the results of benchmarks by the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) (some in the course of the Multimedia Test Phase (2007‚Äì2008) and the HDTV Test Phase I (2009‚Äì2011)), some RR/FR metrics have been standardized in ITU-T as: * ITU-T Rec. J.147 (FR), 2002 (includes VQM) * ITU-T Rec. J.246 (RR), 2008 * ITU-T Rec. J.247 (FR), 2008 (see PEVQ) * ITU-T Rec. J.341 (FR), 2011 (see VQuad-HD) * ITU-T Rec. J.342 (RR), 2011 The Structural Similarity (SSIM) FR image quality metric is also often used for estimating video quality. Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) ‚Äì also an image quality metric ‚Äì is a core element of the Netflix Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF), a tool that combines existing metrics to predict video quality.  Bitstream-based metrics  Full or reduced-reference metrics still require access to the original video bitstream before transmission, or at least part of it. In practice, an original stream may not always be available for comparison, for example when measuring the quality from the user side. In other situations, a network operator may want to measure the quality of video streams passing through their network, without fully decoding them. For a more efficient estimation of video quality in such cases, parametric/bitstream-based metrics have also been standardized: * ITU-T Rec. P.1201, 2012 * ITU-T Rec. P.1202, 2012 * ITU-T Rec. P.1203.1, 2016  Use in practice  Few of these standards have found commercial applications, including PEVQ and VQuad-HD. SSIM is also part of a commercially available video quality toolset (SSIMWAVE). VMAF is used by Netflix to tune their encoding and streaming algorithms, and to quality-control all streamed content. It is also being used by other technology companies like Bitmovin and has been integrated into software such as FFmpeg. = Training and performance evaluation = Since objective video quality models are expected to predict results given by human observers, they are developed with the aid of subjective test results. During development of an objective model, its parameters should be trained so as to achieve the best correlation between the objectively predicted values and the subjective scores, often available as mean opinion scores (MOS). The most widely used subjective test materials are in the public-domain and include still picture, motion picture, streaming video, high definition, 3-D (stereoscopic) and special-purposes picture quality related datasets. These so-called databases are created by various research laboratories around the world. Some of them have become de facto standards, including several public- domain subjective picture quality databases created and maintained by the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) as well the Tampere Image Database 2008. A collection of databases can be found in the QUALINET Databases repository. The Consumer Digital Video Library (CDVL) hosts freely available video test sequences for model development. In theory, a model can be trained on a set of data in such a way that it produces perfectly matching scores on that dataset. However, such a model will be over-trained and will therefore not perform well on new datasets. It is therefore advised to validate models against new data and use the resulting performance as a real indicator of the model's prediction accuracy. To measure the performance of a model, some frequently used metrics are the linear correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and the root mean square error (RMSE). Other metrics are the kappa coefficient and the outliers ratio. ITU-T Rec. P.1401 gives an overview of statistical procedures to evaluate and compare objective models. = Uses and application of objective models = Objective video quality models can be used in various application areas. In video codec development, the performance of a codec is often evaluated in terms of PSNR or SSIM. For service providers, objective models can be used for monitoring a system. For example, an IPTV provider may choose to monitor their service quality by means of objective models, rather than asking users for their opinion, or waiting for customer complaints about bad video quality. An objective model should only be used in the context that it was developed for. For example, a model that was developed using a particular video codec is not guaranteed to be accurate for another video codec. Similarly, a model trained on tests performed on a large TV screen should not be used for evaluating the quality of a video watched on a mobile phone. = Other approaches = When estimating quality of a video codec, all the mentioned objective methods may require repeating post-encoding tests in order to determine the encoding parameters that satisfy a required level of visual quality, making them time consuming, complex and impractical for implementation in real commercial applications. There is ongoing research into developing novel objective evaluation methods which enable prediction of the perceived quality level of the encoded video before the actual encoding is performed. Subjective video quality The main goal of many objective video quality metrics is to automatically estimate the average user's (viewer's) opinion on the quality of a video processed by a system. Procedures for subjective video quality measurements are described in ITU-R recommendation BT.500 and ITU-T recommendation P.910. In such tests, video sequences are shown to a group of viewers. The viewers' opinion is recorded and averaged into the mean opinion score to evaluate the quality of each video sequence. However, the testing procedure may vary depending on what kind of system is tested.

At Simpla-12, Obi-Wan teams up with Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi before preparing to break into Zan Arbor's hideout and rescue Qui-Gon. However, it will not be an easy task, for Zan Arbor's laboratory is nearly impregnable.

A Queensland State of Origin representative , he previously played for the Penrith Panthers, with whom he won the 2003 NRL Premiership. Background Wesser is of Aboriginal and South Sea Islander (Vanuatuan) descent. Wesser began his rugby league career in the Queensland town of Rockhampton having moved there, with his junior club, the Rockhampton Brothers. At age 16, Wesser was selected for the Queensland Under 17s representative side. Wesser finished his schooling at Emmaus College, Rockhampton, and also helped his School side take out the Mal Meninga Under 19s Cup, being the fourth fastest 19-year-old in the state, running times around 100 metres in 11 seconds. Professional playing career =Penrith Panthers= Debuting in 1998 Wesser moved from his hometown of Rockhampton to the foot of the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, to play for the Penrith Panthers but he found trouble in pushing for a first- grade spot with Peter Jorgensen holding that title. Three years later Rhys was given the opportunity to play first grade with the departure of Jorgensen. Wesser scored ten tries in his debut season despite Penrith finishing last on the premiership table. In 2002, he scored a Penrith club record of nineteen tries, including three hat-tricks, and was dubbed \\"Rhys-Lightning\\" and soon became a crowd favourite with his acceleration and line-breaking ability. The following season Wesser bettered his own record by scoring on 25 occasions, earning the title of the most prolific try-scoring fullback for a season in the history of Australian rugby league. The Panthers won their second premiership title, thrashing the Sydney Roosters in the 2003 NRL grand final in which Wesser played at fullback. As 2003 NRL premiers, the Penrith travelled to England to face 2003 Super League champions, the Bradford Bulls in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Wesser played at in the Panthers' 22‚Äì4 loss. Wesser's try-scoring declined in 2004 with the addition of Amos Roberts to the squad but he still scored thirteen tries. Wesser was selected to play for Queensland in the 2004 State of Origin series. Wesser in 2005 Wesser made the Aboriginal selection in the exhibition game against the New Zealand MƒÅori side as part of the official opening of the 2008 World Cup on 26 October.Indigenous Dreamtime team named @ Official RLWC08 site, 11 October 2008. In 2008, Wesser announced that he would be joining the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2009 for a two-year deal. Wesser's 113 tries is the most scored by any Penrith player. =South Sydney Rabbitohs= In only the second round of the 2009 season, his first with Souths, Wesser injured his knee. He made his return to the field in the 2010 NRL season. On 12 August 2011, Wesser announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season. He was unable to finish his final season of Rugby League due to another knee injury sustained late in the season.

Springer- Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.  Classification  Altingiaceae now consists of the single genus Liquidambar with 15 known species. Previously, the genera Altingia and Semiliquidambar were also recognised, but these represent a rapid radiation and have been difficult to separate reliably. Semiliquidambar has recently been shown to be composed of hybrids of species of Altingia and Liquidambar. This result had been expected for some time. Altingia and Liquidambar are known to be paraphyletic and a revision of the family has been prepared. Many of the species are closely related, and distinctions between them are likely to be artificial.  History  The name \\"Altingiaceae\\" has a long and complex taxonomic history. Some attribute the name to John Lindley, who published it in 1846. Others say that the authority for the name is Paul F. Horaninov, who described the group in 1841.James L. Reveal. 2008 onward. \\"A Checklist of Family and Suprafamilial Names for Extant Vascular Plants.\\" At: Home page of James L. Reveal and C. Rose Broome. (see External links below). In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the family Altingiaceae was not generally accepted. Most authors placed these genera in Hamamelidaceae and this treatment has been followed in some recent works as well.Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). In the twenty-first century, however, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that including Altingiaceae in Hamamelidaceae makes Hamamelidaceae paraphyletic. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group recognizes four families in the lineage including Altingiaceae. Cercidiphyllaceae and Daphniphyllaceae are sister. This clade is sister to Hamamelidaceae and these three families are sister to Altingiaceae. The clade is sister to PaeoniaceaeShuguang Jian, Pamela S. Soltis, Matthew A. Gitzendanner, Michael J.

In recent years, most attention has focused on the use of the power to pass legislation giving effect within Australia to its obligations under international treaties and conventions. In some cases, as with human rights or environmental protection, the activities regulated by treaty-implementing legislation have not been international in nature but rather located solely within Australia or even solely within a particular State. In Australia, developments in international law have no direct effect for domestic purposes unless a deliberate law-making act by the proper law-making authority has \\"transformed\\" the international rule into a domestic rule. Origins According to Constitutional law academic Michael Coper, it is \\"not entirely clear what the founding fathers intended\\" by conferring upon the Commonwealth Parliament the right to legislate with respect to \\"external affairs\\". Section 51(xxix) was amended a number of times in the Constitutional Conventions that debated the draft Constitution in the 1890s. The draft Constitution adopted by the 1891 Sydney Convention allowed the Parliament to make laws with respect to \\"External affairs and Treaties\\". This wording carried through the 1897 Adelaide Convention but the New South Wales Legislative Council, when considering whether to ratify the draft, resolved to omit the words \\"and Treaties\\" on the basis that only the Imperial Parliament ought to enter treaties that bound Australia. The removal of the explicit reference to treaties was confirmed by the delegates to the 1897 Sydney Convention and the 1898 Melbourne Convention. In 1901, Robert Garran and John Quick suggested that the external affairs power would \\"prove to be a great constitutional battle-ground.\\" Some 86 years later, Coper remarked that their prediction \\"showed remarkable foresight\\".  External affairs  = Relations with other countries = The term \\"external affairs\\" was used in section 51(xxix) rather than \\"foreign affairs\\" to make it clear that relations with the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire were intended to be included. When the Australian Constitution was created in 1901, the United Kingdom and its possessions were not conceived of as \\"foreign\\" to Australia. Chief Justice Latham said in R v Sharkey (1949) that \\"external affairs\\" was not confined to the \\"preservation of friendly relations with other Dominions\\", but extended to relations with \\"all countries outside Australia\\".. Justice Brennan in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982) extended this to relations with other \\"international persons\\", especially the United Nations and its various specialised agencies.. The judges in Seas and Submerged Lands case (1975) differed as to whether the \\"external affairs\\" power entitled the Commonwealth to assert its sovereignty over Australia's territorial sea, though a majority held that it did.. The underlying reason for this was that the idea of national rights with respect to the \\"continental shelf\\" had emerged since 1945 distinctly as a product of international relations and international law. = Matters external to Australia = According to Chief Justice Barwick in Seas and Submerged Lands Case, the external affairs power extends to anything \\"which in its nature is external to\\" Australia, or according to Justice Mason \\"to matters or things geographically situated outside Australia\\".. These suggestions were reinforced in later cases, and finally assumed decisive importance in Polyukhovich v Commonwealth (War Crimes Act Case) (1991)... In this case, all judges other than Justice Brennan held that s 51(xxix) contained a sufficient grant of power to support a law to identify and prosecute \\"war crimes\\" committed in Europe during World War II. Chief Justice Mason, and justices Deane, Dawson and McHugh held that this conclusion was sufficiently based on the fact that the geographical location in which the relevant acts were alleged to have been done was physically external to Australia. = Implementing treaties (international law) = To some extent, there has been debate over whether the ratification of an international treaty may justify the exercise of Commonwealth legislative power for the purpose of the implementation of that treaty. There is a marked difference between earlier and modern approaches to this issue. Initial approaches produced an unqualified view that Parliament could legislate to give effect to any obligation or even non-binding recommendation contained in an international treaty once ratified. It was later qualified by Stephen J that it was necessary that the treaty at the very least deals with an area of international concern. However, this test of 'international concern' was rejected by Mason J in Tasmanian Dam Case in 1983, which outlines the current approach to implementing treaties and was later confirmed by subsequent cases. and .

Early life He was born in Seville. In 1598, aged 20, he was in Central Europe as an ambassador with a mandate to travel and bring back to Spain the 13- to 14-year-old orphaned bride Margaret of Austria (daughter of Archduke Charles II of Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria), the first, and only wife of king Philip III of Spain, being awarded the title of Marquess of Guadalc√°zar, in 1609. Viceroy of New Spain Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba was named viceroy of New Spain by King Philip III of Spain, for whom he had served as lord of the bedchamber. Early in his mandate in New Spain, he sent Captain Diego Mart√≠nez de Hurd√°iz to suppress an uprising of the Tehuecos, an ethnic subgroup of the Cahuitas of Sinaloa. Mart√≠nez de Hurd√°iz was successful after fighting several battles. The viceroy also founded many cities, including Lerma (1613), C√≥rdoba (1618), and Guadalc√°zar (1620). The Mexican C√≥rdoba, in what is now Veracruz State, was founded in part to help suppress marauding bands of escaped black slaves that preyed on travelers between Veracruz and Mexico City. He also completed the Fort of San Diego in Acapulco, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. In 1616, the drainage system for the Valley of Mexico, long under construction but suspended since 1614, was restarted. King Philip III had chosen the Dutch hydrographer Adrian Boot to investigate the drainage project and take charge of operations. Boot had been in charge of numerous drainage projects in France. He traveled to Mexico City (at a salary of 100 ducats a month) and reviewed the work already done. His opinion was that it would not serve to drain the lakes, but that it could be used to divert the Cuautitl√°n river, the major cause of the nearly annual floods. Engineer Enrico Mart√≠nez offered to complete the diversion with 300 men and 100,000 pesos, but work was delayed pending approval of the king. On November 16, 1616 another, particularly bloody, Indian insurrection broke out, this time among the Tepehuanes and neighboring tribes in the north. It was led by a cacique claiming to be the Son of the Sun and God of Heaven and Earth. The rebels quickly killed some Jesuit missionaries and 200 Spaniards and mestizos of various ages and both sexes. The governor of Durango, with aid sent by the viceroy, raised a militia. After three months of intense fighting, the rebels were largely defeated. Also in 1616, a drought led to crop failure and famine in New Spain. In 1620 a fire destroyed a large part of Veracruz. Fern√°ndez also improved the sanitation and water supply of Mexico City, completing the aqueduct from Chapultepec in 1620. This aqueduct consisted of 900 arches. He established a tribunal to regulate the buying, selling and taxing of mercury metal used in gold and silver metallurgy, which the mines of New Spain had begun to produce in some quantity at Huancavelica. Due to his various improvements, he received the nickname el Buen Virrey (The Good Viceroy). Viceroy of Peru In Peru, Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba reformed the fiscal system and stopped the inter-family rivalry that was bloodying the domain, mainly in the fabulous silver city of Potos√≠, between vicu√±as and vascongados. In 1624 he fortified Lima against pirate attacks, including those by Jacques l'Hermite, a Dutch merchant, explorer and admiral known for his journey around the globe with the Nassau Fleet (1623‚Äì1626) and for his blockade and raid on Callao in 1624 during that same voyage in which he also died. In 1629, Viceroy Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba gave up his charge and returned to Spain, where he died the following year, at Guadalc√°zar, aged 52.

Hidcote Manor Garden is a garden in the United Kingdom, located at the village of Hidcote Bartrim, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. It is one of the best-known and most influential Arts and Crafts gardens in Britain, with its linked \\"rooms\\" of hedges, rare trees, shrubs and herbaceous borders. Created by Lawrence Johnston, it is owned by the National Trust and is open to the public.  History  The Americans, Lawrence Johnston and his mother, settled in Britain about 1900, and Lawrence immediately became a British citizen and fought in the British army during the Boer war. In 1907 Johnston's mother, Mrs Gertrude Winthrop (she had re- married), purchased the Hidcote Manor Estate. It was situated in a part of Britain with strong connections to the then-burgeoning Arts and Crafts movement and an Anglicized American artistic expatriate community centred nearby at Broadway, Worcestershire. Johnston soon became interested in turning the fields around the house into a garden. By 1910 he had begun to lay out the key features of the garden, and by the 1920s he had twelve full-time gardeners working for him. After World War II Johnston spent most of his time at Jardin Serre de la Madone, his garden in the south of France; and in 1947 he entrusted Hidcote to the National Trust. The style of the garden has been widely imitated. In 2007 a temporary garden designed by Chris Beardshaw that drew inspiration from Johnson's Hidcote was constructed at the Chelsea Flower Show in London.  Character of Hidcote garden  Avenue to gate White garden Lawrence Johnston was influenced in creating his garden at Hidcote by the work of Alfred Parsons and Gertrude Jekyll, who were designing gardens of hardy plants contained within sequences of outdoor \\"rooms\\". The theme was in the air: Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson's Sissinghurst Castle Garden was laid out as a sequence of such spaces, without, it seems, direct connection with the reclusive and shy Major Johnston. Hidcote's outdoor \\"rooms\\" have various characters and themes, achieved by the use of box hedges, hornbeam and yew, and stone walls. These rooms, such as the 'White Garden' and 'Fuchsia Garden' are linked, some by vistas, and furnished with topiaries. Some have ponds and fountains, and all are planted with flowers in bedding schemes. They surround the 17th century manor house, and there are a number of outhouses and a kitchen garden. Johnston's care in selecting the best plants is reflected in the narrow-leaved lavender, Lavandula angustifolia 'Hidcote', in the Penstemon 'Hidcote Pink' and in the hybrid Hypericum 'Hidcote Gold', acclaimed as the finest hardy St John's Wort, Alice Coats records.Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v.

History and description The band was formed in Glasgow in 1984 by ex-Altered Images guitarist Johnny McElhone on bass, and featuring Grahame Skinner (vocals), Pim Jones (guitar) and Harry Travers (drums). Skinner and Travers had been members of the band Kites with Paul McGrath and Ian McGreevy before Hipsway formed. Their music was characterized by Skinner's deep vocals and Jones' rhythmic guitar style. They were quickly signed up by Mercury Records and by 1985 had released their first, eponymously titled album. The album was a moderate success in the UK Albums Chart; while the single, \\"The Honeythief\\", made number 17 in the UK Singles Chart, and also reached the Top 20 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Another song from the album, \\"Tinder\\", became well known in Scotland as the soundtrack to a McEwan's Lager commercial. However the band failed to build on its success; McElhone founded Texas, and by the time the second album Scratch the Surface was recorded, Travers had also left (to be replaced by Stephen Ferrera). Released in 1989, the album was not as critically or commercially successful as its predecessor, and the band split up shortly afterwards. Skinner and Jones subsequently went on to found the band Witness, releasing the album \\"House Called Love\\" (A&M;), before Skinner joined former members of Glasgow peers Love and Money in the band, Cowboy Mouth. Pim Jones later formed Big Yoga Muffin with Ange Dolittle, formerly of Eat, releasing one album Wherever You Go, There You Are (2000, The Echo Label). In 2011, Grahame Skinner formed the band Skinner with Douglas MacIntyre (Love & Money, Cowboy Mouth and Sugartown), Gordon Wilson (Love & Money and Cowboy Mouth) and Andy Alston (Del Amitri). In November 2016, Hipsway reformed, playing at Summerhall, Edinburgh then two dates at Glasgow O2 ABC, Sauchiehall St, in support of the 30th anniversary Deluxe reissue of their first album. As a result of the positive reception to the re-issue and the 2016 shows, the band played a limited number of gigs in 2017 and 2018, including sell-out shows at the reopened Glasgow Kelvingrove Bandstand and the legendary Barrowlands Ballroom. Hipsway's first album for almost 30 years, Smoke & Dreams, was released in late 2018. Post-reformation touring/recording band members have included Jim McDermott (drums), Gary Houston (bass), Stevie Christie (keyboards), Andy May (keyboards), Andy Gillespie (keyboards), David Robertson (percussion) and Louise Murphy (vocals).

It is immediately south of the central business district. It is in the local government area of City of Hobart. Battery Point is named after the battery of guns which were established on the point in 1818 as part of the Hobart coastal defences. The battery was situated on the site of today's Princes Park. The guns were used to fire salutes on ceremonial occasions but were never called upon to repel an invasion. The battery was decommissioned after an 1878 review of Hobart's defences found that its location would tend to draw an enemy's fire onto the surrounding residential neighbourhood. The site was subsequently handed over to the Hobart City Council as a place of recreation and amusement. When the Council carried out works to beautify the park in 1934, they discovered tunnels which had served as a magazine for the original battery.Howatson, Donald, The Story of Battery Point ‚Äì Street by Street, 2012, In 1973, a green ban was placed by the Builders Labourers Federation to prevent destruction of certain buildings by developers.

Specifically, it deals with how the brain processes multiple sensory modality inputs, such as proprioception, vision, auditory system, tactile, olfactory, vestibular system, interoception, and taste into usable functional outputs. It has been believed for some time that inputs from different sensory organs are processed in different areas in the brain. The communication within and among these specialized areas of the brain is known as functional integration. Newer research has shown that these different regions of the brain may not be solely responsible for only one sensory modality, but could use multiple inputs to perceive what the body senses about its environment. Multisensory integration is necessary for almost every activity that we perform because the combination of multiple sensory inputs is essential for us to comprehend our surroundings. Overview It has been believed for some time that inputs from different sensory organs are processed in different areas in the brain, relating to systems neuroscience. Using functional neuroimaging, it can be seen that sensory-specific cortices are activated by different inputs. For example, regions in the occipital cortex are tied to vision and those on the superior temporal gyrus are recipients of auditory inputs. There exist studies suggesting deeper multisensory convergences than those at the sensory-specific cortices, which were listed earlier. This convergence of multiple sensory modalities is known as multisensory integration. Sensory processing deals with how the brain processes sensory input from multiple sensory modalities. These include the five classic senses of vision (sight), audition (hearing), tactile stimulation (touch), olfaction (smell), and gustation (taste). Other sensory modalities exist, for example the vestibular sense (balance and the sense of movement) and proprioception (the sense of knowing one's position in space) Along with Time (The sense of knowing where one is in time or activities). It is important that the information of these different sensory modalities must be relatable. The sensory inputs themselves are in different electrical signals, and in different contexts. Through sensory processing, the brain can relate all sensory inputs into a coherent percept, upon which our interaction with the environment is ultimately based. =Basic structures involved= The different senses were always thought to be controlled by separate lobes of the brain, called projection areas. The lobes of the brain are the classifications that divide the brain both anatomically and functionally. These lobes are the Frontal lobe, responsible for conscious thought, Parietal lobe, responsible for visuospatial processing, the Occipital lobe, responsible for the sense of sight, and the temporal lobe, responsible for the senses of smell and sound. From the earliest times of neurology, it has been thought that these lobes are solely responsible for their one sensory modality input. However, newer research has shown that that may not entirely be the case. =Problems= Sometimes there can be a problem with the encoding of the sensory information. This disorder is known as Sensory processing disorder (SPD). This disorder can be further classified into three main types. * Sensory modulation disorder, in which patients seek sensory stimulation due to an over or under response to sensory stimuli. * Sensory based motor disorder. Patients have incorrect processing of motor information that leads to poor motor skills. * Sensory processing disorder or sensory discrimination disorder, which is characterized by postural control problems, lack of attentiveness, and disorganization. There are several therapies used to treat SPD. Anna Jean Ayres claimed that a child needs a healthy \\"sensory diet,\\" which is all of the activities that children engage in, that gives them the necessary sensory inputs that they need to get their brain into improving sensory processing. History In the 1930s, Dr. Wilder Penfield was conducting a very bizarre operation at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Dr. Penfield \\"pioneered the incorporation of neurophysiological principles in the practice of neurosurgery. Dr. Penfield was interested in determining a solution to solve the epileptic seizure problems that his patients were having. He used an electrode to stimulate different regions of the brain's cortex, and would ask his still conscious patient what he or she felt. This process led to the publication of his book, The Cerebral Cortex of Man. The \\"mapping\\" of the sensations his patients felt led Dr. Penfield to chart out the sensations that were triggered by stimulating different cortical regions. Mrs. H. P. Cantlie was the artist Dr. Penfield hired to illustrate his findings. The result was the conception of the first sensory Homunculus. The Homonculus is a visual representation of the intensity of sensations derived from different parts of the body. Dr. Wilder Penfield and his colleague Herbert Jasper developed the Montreal procedure using an electrode to stimulate different parts of the brain to determine which parts were the cause of the epilepsy. This part could then be surgically removed or altered in order to regain optimal brain performance. While performing these tests, they discovered that the functional maps of the sensory and motor cortices were similar in all patients. Because of their novelty at the time, these Homonculi were hailed as the \\"E=mc¬≤ of Neuroscience\\". Current research There are still no definitive answers to the questions regarding the relationship between functional and structural asymmetries in the brain. There are a number of asymmetries in the human brain including how language is processed mainly in the left hemisphere of the brain. There have been some cases, however, in which individuals have comparable language skills to someone who uses his left hemisphere to process language, yet they mainly use their right or both hemispheres. These cases pose the possibility that function may not follow structure in some cognitive tasks. Current research in the fields of sensory processing and multisensory integration is aiming to hopefully unlock the mysteries behind the concept of brain lateralization. Research on sensory processing has much to offer towards understanding the function of the brain as a whole. The primary task of multisensory integration is to figure out and sort out the vast quantities of sensory information in the body through multiple sensory modalities. These modalities not only are not independent, but they are also quite complementary. Where one sensory modality may give information on one part of a situation, another modality can pick up other necessary information. Bringing this information together facilitates the better understanding of the physical world around us. It may seem redundant that we are being provided with multiple sensory inputs about the same object, but that is not necessarily the case. This so-called \\"redundant\\" information is in fact verification that what we are experiencing is in fact happening. Perceptions of the world are based on models that we build of the world. Sensory information informs these models, but this information can also confuse the models. Sensory illusions occur when these models do not match up. For example, where our visual system may fool us in one case, our auditory system can bring us back to a ground reality. This prevents sensory misrepresentations, because through the combination of multiple sensory modalities, the model that we create is much more robust and gives a better assessment of the situation. Thinking about it logically, it is far easier to fool one sense than it is to simultaneously fool two or more senses. Examples One of the earliest sensations is the olfactory sensation. Evolutionary, gustation and olfaction developed together. This multisensory integration was necessary for early humans in order to ensure that they were receiving proper nutrition from their food, and also to make sure that they were not consuming poisonous materials. There are several other sensory integrations that developed early on in the human evolutionary time line. The integration between vision and audition was necessary for spatial mapping. Integration between vision and tactile sensations developed along with our finer motor skills including better hand-eye coordination. While humans developed into bipedal organisms, balance became exponentially more essential to survival. The multisensory integration between visual inputs, vestibular (balance) inputs, and proprioception inputs played an important role in our development into upright walkers. =Audiovisual system= Perhaps one of the most studied sensory integrations is the relationship between vision and audition. These two senses perceive the same objects in the world in different ways, and by combining the two, they help us understand this information better. Vision dominates our perception of the world around us. This is because visual spatial information is one of the most reliable sensory modalities. Visual stimuli are recorded directly onto the retina, and there are few, if any, external distortions that provide incorrect information to the brain about the true location of an object. Other spatial information is not as reliable as visual spatial information. For example, consider auditory spatial input. The location of an object can sometimes be determined solely on its sound, but the sensory input can easily be modified or altered, thus giving a less reliable spatial representation of the object. Auditory information therefore is not spatially represented unlike visual stimuli. But once one has the spatial mapping from the visual information, multisensory integration helps bring the information from both the visual and auditory stimuli together to make a more robust mapping. There have been studies done that show that a dynamic neural mechanism exists for matching the auditory and visual inputs from an event that stimulates multiple senses. One example of this that has been observed is how the brain compensates for target distance. When you are speaking with someone or watching something happen, auditory and visual signals are not being processed concurrently, but they are perceived as being simultaneous. This kind of multisensory integration can lead to slight misperceptions in the visual-auditory system in the form of the ventriloquist effect. An example of the ventriloquism effect is when a person on the television appears to have his voice coming from his mouth, rather than the television's speakers. This occurs because of a pre-existing spatial representation within the brain which is programmed to think that voices come from another human's mouth. This then makes it so the visual response to the audio input is spatially misrepresented, and therefore misaligned. =Sensorimotor system= Hand eye coordination is one example of sensory integration. In this case, we require a tight integration of what we visually perceive about an object, and what we tactilely perceive about that same object. If these two senses were not combined within the brain, then one would have less ability to manipulate an object. Eye‚Äìhand coordination is the tactile sensation in the context of the visual system. The visual system is very static, in that it doesn't move around much, but the hands and other parts used in tactile sensory collection can freely move around. This movement of the hands must be included in the mapping of both the tactile and visual sensations, otherwise one would not be able to comprehend where they were moving their hands, and what they were touching and looking at. An example of this happening is looking at an infant. The infant picks up objects and puts them in his mouth, or touches them to his feet or face. All of these actions are culminating to the formation of spatial maps in the brain and the realization that \\"Hey, that thing that's moving this object is actually a part of me.\\" Seeing the same thing that they are feeling is a major step in the mapping that is required for infants to begin to realize that they can move their arms and interact with an object. This is the earliest and most explicit way of experiencing sensory integration. Further research In the future, research on sensory integration will be used to better understand how different sensory modalities are incorporated within the brain to help us perform even the simplest of tasks. For example, we do not currently have the understanding needed to comprehend how neural circuits transform sensory cues into changes in motor activities. More research done on the sensorimotor system can help understand how these movements are controlled. This understanding can potentially be used to learn more about how to make better prosthetics, and eventually help patients who have lost the use of a limb. Also, by learning more about how different sensory inputs can combine can have profound effects on new engineering approaches using robotics. The robot's sensory devices may take in inputs of different modalities, but if we understand multisensory integration better, we might be able to program these robots to convey these data into a useful output to better serve our purposes.

The parish includes the hamlets of Hawkshead Hill, to the north west, and Outgate, a similar distance north. Hawkshead contains one primary school but no secondary school and four public houses. Geography Hawkshead is just north of Esthwaite Water, in a valley to the west of Windermere and east of Coniston Water. It is part of Furness, making it a part of the ancient county of Lancashire. History The township of Hawkshead was originally owned by the monks of Furness Abbey; nearby Colthouse derives its name from the stables owned by the Abbey. Hawkshead grew to be an important wool market in medieval times and later as a market town after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1532. It was granted its first market charter by King James I in 1608. In 1585, Hawkshead Grammar School was established by Archbishop Edwin Sandys of York after he successfully petitioned Queen Elizabeth I for a charter to establish a governing body. Hawkshead Parish Church, built in 1300 and rebuilt in the 16th century St Michael and All Angels', founded in the 12th century & a fine example of an English rural parish church In the 18th and 19th centuries, Hawkshead became a village of local importance. William Wordsworth (afterwards poet laureate) was educated at Hawkshead Grammar School, whilst Beatrix Potter lived nearby as did William Heelis, a local solicitor, in the early 20th century. With the formation of the Lake District National Park in 1951, tourism grew in importance, though traditional farming still goes on around the village. Hawkshead has a timeless atmosphere and consists of a characterful warren of alleys, overhanging gables and a series of mediaeval squares. It is eloquently described in William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude. Much of the land in and around the village is now owned by the National Trust. The National Trust property is called Hawkshead and Claife. Governance The electoral ward of the same name stretches south to Colton with a total population of 1,704. =Parliamentary representation= Hawkshead is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency and is represented in parliament by Tim Farron MP.

Their modest antecedents stretched back to the mid 11th century, according to the family's genealogist Luigi Passerini, but a restructuring of the Peruzzi company in 1300, with an infusion of outside capital, marked the start of a quarter-century of prosperity that brought the family consortium to the forefront of Florentine affairs. Patronage Semi-public patronage reaffirmed the Peruzzi status in Florence: in his will in 1299, Donato di Arnoldo Peruzzi left money for a memorial chapel in a transept of the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence. It was probably his grandson Giovanni di Rinieri Peruzzi who was Giotto's patron in frescoing the walls with murals honoring John the Evangelist and John the Baptist, which Giotto executed, starting in 1313. For economic historians, the surviving account books of the Peruzzi from the years 1335-1343 provide an indispensable primary source for the economic history of the city on the cusp of the late Medieval and Early Modern period. The contemporary chronicler Giovanni Villani is the other prime source for the family's affairs. Company The company that bore the Peruzzi name was run by a half-dozen family members, and there were many Peruzzi who were neither active nor silent partners, pursuing other careers, even amassing independent capital. The company's courier system acted as an intelligence-gathering system often embroiled in diplomacy. The size of the bank should not be understated: by the 1330s, the Peruzzi bank was the second largest in Europe, with fifteen branches from the Middle East to London, all capitalized to the sum of more than 100,000 gold florins and manned by approximately 100 factors.pg 3 of De Roover 1966 Peruzzi capital had been amassed in the textile business that was the main engine of Florence's prosperity. English wool finished as high-quality cloth in Bruges was bought by Peruzzi fattori and distributed to the luxurious courts of Paris, Avignon or returned to London. Peruzzi connections with the Knights Hospitallers gained them important local leverage in Rhodes, the economic capital of the Aegean and a transshipping port for silks, drugs, spices and luxuries from the East. Trade beyond Italy required agents and instruments of credit, extending the family business beyond its extended membership into an international network. In Italy was developed the double-entry bookkeeping that made such complicated financial transactions possible. By the opening of the 14th century, the main activity of the Peruzzi had switched to wholesale commodities trading on a very large scale, especially in grain exported from France to the central Italian cities --for which they were granted a monopoly-- and to banking, the field for which they are remembered: popes, nobles, bourgeois, towns and abbeys drew loans from the Peruzzi. But great clients incurred great risks. In 1343 the Peruzzi consortium collapsed and was bankrupt in 1345, with their partners in risk- capital, the Bardi. Unsecured loans The traditional explanation, of unsecured loans extended to Edward III of England, is currently considered simplistic. In fact, several factors destabilized the network of trade. The war with Castruccio Castracane of Lucca bled Florentine specie to pay for mercenaries, while France and England went to war over Aquitaine, and the peasants of Flanders rose up in a revolt that was put down with the aid of mercenaries purchased with Peruzzi florins. Not all of the family fortunes were lost in the bankruptcy, and the Peruzzi continued to figure among the prominent families of Florence, the patrizii di Firenze. Even as late as 1849, in the wake of the disturbances of 1848, the gonfaloniere of Florence was Ubaldino Peruzzi.Giuseppe Conti, Firenze Vecchia Family commune The tower of the fortified Villa Peruzzi in the commune of Antella south of Florence controls the main road into the Chianti district. Members of the family who emigrated to America in the late 19th century and settled in Pennsylvania founded the Peruzzi chain of automobile dealerships and the Planters Nut and Chocolate Company.

It is similar to games such as Chase H.Q. and Out Run, where players control a police squad car that must race against other computer-controlled players to make it to the end of each race in first place. Players can also take different routes to bypass certain portions of the game. Three different cabinet types were created, a standard upright, a sit-down, and a motion-based \\"deluxe\\" machine; both of these could be connected, or \\"linked\\", together to enable multiplayer. Cisco Heat was designed by many former employees of Sega, who had left the company to form BitBox, which developed Jaleco Rally: Big Run. After Jaleco absorbed the company, the team began work on a spiritual successor to Big Run. Yasuhiko Takashiba composed the soundtrack. The game was ported to several home computers in European countries, including the Atari ST, Commodore 64 and Amiga, all of which were published by Image Works. The arcade version of Cisco Heat was praised for its gameplay, presentation and controls, with one finding it to be a drastic improvement over Jaleco's previous arcade games. The home computer ports were met with a much more negative reception for their generally poor quality. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot In Cisco Heat, players control a police squad car through San Francisco in an attempt to win the \\"National Championship Police Car Steeplechase\\" in first place. Gameplay is similar to Out Run and Chase H.Q., where players must race against computer-controlled vehicles to the end of each section, taking place in a different area of San Francisco. Sections contain famous landmarks from the city, namely the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and tram cars, as well as several features such as steep dives, 90-degree turns and multiple selectable routes, which can allow players to bypass certain portions of the race and shortcut to another area. Players can select from two different police cars, both being based on the Cadillac Brougham and Nissan 300ZX Z32 respectively. Up to four Cisco Heat cabinets can be connected, or \\"linked\\", together to enable multiplayer play. Development and release Cisco Heat was developed and published by Jaleco, originally released in October 1990 in Japan. It was released in North America in November 1990 and in Europe in early 1991. Most of the development staff who worked on the game were former members of Sega, who left the company to form the short-lived developer Bit Box, which created Jaleco Rally: Big Run (1989). After Jaleco absorbed the company in 1990, the development team became part of Jaleco and worked on a successor to Big Run, which later became Cisco Heat. For this reason, Cisco Heat bears several similarities to Big Run, and was even marketed as a conversion kit for older Big Run arcade units. The soundtrack was composed by Yasuhiko Takashiba. Three different cabinet types were produced for the game, a standard upright machine, a sit-down, and a \\"deluxe\\" unit with minor motion capabilities. In 1991, Cisco Heat was exhibited at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International expo in the United Kingdom. Cisco Heat was ported to several home computer platforms in 1991, all of which were developed by UK-based developers ICE Software and Moonstone Computing, and published by Image Works; these being the Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amiga, MS-DOS, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, and several IBM-compatible PCs. The Amiga version in particular, designed by Stuart Campbell, was entirely reworked to accommodate for the computer's technical limitations, and in turn has little to do with the original arcade game. An Atari Jaguar version of Cisco Heat was announced in 1994, but was never released. Reception The arcade version of Cisco Heat was met with a favorable reception from critics. Sinclair User compared it to Out Run and Chase H.Q. for their similar gameplay, saying that its impressive atmosphere, fast-paced action and generally well-made presentation made Cisco Heat \\"one hell of a driving game\\". CU Amiga felt the same, and claimed that it was one of the better arcade games produced by Jaleco, and showed that they had the resources to produce a well-designed racer after Big Run. They labeled it as a \\"stunner\\" for its presentation, gameplay and fast-paced action, alongside its responsive controls and colorful visuals. The One called it \\"an urban Chase H.Q.\\" for its similar gameplay and aesthetic, commending its multiplayer mode and cabinet linking system. The home computer ports were met with a far-less positive fanfare. Reviewing the Amiga version, Amiga Action criticized the controls for being sensitive, the scrolling for being jerky, and the graphics for being poorly-made. They felt the game had a \\"rather amateurish\\" theme to it in regards to its presentation and overall quality, further criticizing it for being a generally unimpressive game. German publication Power Play had a similar response, adding that the game lacked originality compared to other similar games for the system and for its 3D effects being of poor quality. The Commodore 64 version received a record-low score of 12% by Commodore Format, who labeled it one of the worst games of 1991; they lambasted nearly every aspect of the game, greatly disliking its presentation, jerky scrolling, bad framerate and large amount of glitches. ZZap!64 shared many of the same criticisms, further disliking its lack of difficulty and bland music. In light of their criticism, they liked the port's short load times, which were only at the beginning of the game.

It is the largest island in the Lamu Archipelago, which lie between the towns of Lamu and Kiunga in the former Coast Province. The island is almost completely surrounded by mangroves. Like much of the Swahili Coast, Pate's history was marked by a steady transition from agricultural communities in the early first millennium into a specialized, urban trading society around the 10th century, likely earlier. Islam spread down the coast from African Muslims in the Horn of Africa, helping to develop what would be known as the Swahili culture. Despite myths to the contrary, Pate was neither an Arab nor Persian colony, but an African town frequented by trading Arabs, Persians, Indians, and others. It was the centre of the Pate sultanate from the 13th‚Äì19th centuries. The Swahili port of Pate long vied with Lamu and Takwa (on Manda Island) for economic dominance of the area, and came into prominence around the 14th century. It was subjugated by Lamu, however, in the late 19th century. Public transportation is provided by a few mini buses (known as matatus). The main administrative centre on the island, with the police station, is Faza. Faza Faza town, on the North coast, known by the name of Ampaza by the PortugueseSvat Soucek, \\" The Portuguese and the Turks in the Persian gulf \\" in Studies in ottoman naval history and maritime geography., Analecta isisiana, n¬∞102, The Isis press, Istanbul, 2008. , p. 101-106. dates back at least to the 14th century. In 1587, Faza was destroyed by the Portuguese as the local Sheikh had supported Mir Ali Bey, a notorious privateer who had earlier played a key role in ousting the Portuguese from Muscat. The Portuguese arrived from Goa with some 650 men on their punitive expedition, and unleashed their fury on Faza. Everybody they could find was killed, including the local Sheikh. The Portuguese preserved his head in a barrel of salt for display in India. After 4 days of looting they invited Fazas' arch-rivals from Pate town to take away anything that they liked from Faza.Martin, 1973, p.6 Faza was later resettled. The Portuguese in Faza constructed a chapel there, however, nothing remains of it. In the 18th century Faza again fell into decline due to the rise of Pate. The English Consul Holmwood visited the place in 1873 and found it \\"dirty and infected with diseases\\".Martin, 1973, p.22 Pate Town The Pate Sultanate was a sultanate from at least the beginning of the 13th century until 1895. From 1858 on it was the domain known as Wituland. Archeological evidence suggests Pate was a prominent location in local trade networks by the 10th century.Tolmacheva, Marina; Introduction; \\"The Pate Chronicle\\"; East Lansing: Michigan State University Press; 1993; p. 5 Pate Town is situated on the South-West coast of the island. According to the Pate Chronicle, the town of Pate was founded by refugees from Oman in the 8th century and re-founded by members of the Nabahani family, also from Oman, in 1203. The Pate Chronicle also claims that in the 14th century Pate was so powerful that it had conquered most of the towns on the Swahili Coast. However, recent archaeological findings (by Neville Chittick and later, Mark Horton) suggest that the early references in the Chronicle to Pate are wrong and that the town is in fact younger. The 18th century was known as the \\"Golden Age of Pate\\", when the town was at its height of powers and also prospered in fine arts. Builders constructed some of the finest houses on the Swahili Coast, with extensive elaborate plaster works. Goldsmiths made intricate jewellery, fine cloths (including silks) were made by Pate's weavers and carpenters produced fine wooden furniture. The use and production of the musical instrument known as Siwa were most famous. Two examples of Siwas still remain in the museum in Lamu. Both men and women wrote poetry in the Kiamu dialect of Swahili. The Utendi wa Tambuka, one of the earliest known documents in Swahili, was written in the royal Yunga palace in Pate Town. The downfall of Pate town came as a consequence of continuous quarrelling/warring with its neighbours from the end of the 18th century. In 1811, two British naval officers, Smee and Hardy, visited Pate, and witnessed the infighting.Burton, 1872, pp. 475 ‚àí480 In 1813 the famous \\"Battle of Shela\\" took place at Shela. This was an attempt by Pate, allied with the Mazrui clan from Mombasa/Oman, to subject Lamu. The attempt failed totally, and many were killed. Only a handful of people managed to return to Pate, and their losses were felt for years.Martin, 1973, p.25-26 Thomas Boteler, who visited Pate in 1823, described the seeing the remains of a Portuguese fort, but that the place looked otherwise poor.Boteler, 1835, p. 373 ff The poet Mwana Kupona (d. 1860) also lived at Pate Town. By 1892 the number of inhabitants had fallen to only 300, down from 7000. Today, the town has recovered some. Agriculture is today the main economic activity. Siyu Siyu town is situated on the North coast of Pate island. As no major excavations have been done in Siyu, its age is not known, but it might date from the 13th century. Gaspar de Santo Bernadino visited the town in 1606, and stated that it was the largest town on the island.Martin, 1973, p.23 Siyu's main claim to historical fame is that it through several battles withstood the Sultans of Zanzibar. In 1843 the Sheikh of Siyu, Bwana Machaka wa Shee, and the new Sheikh of Pate, repudiated the sovereignty of Seyyid Said, Sultan of Oman and Zanzibar. In response, Seyyid Said assembled an army consisting of 2000 people from Muscat, Baluchistan and Lamu. Leading them was his cousin, General Seyyid Hemed bin Ahmed Al-Busaidy, known as \\"Amir Hemed\\". He had previously been Governor of Bandar Abbas (in 1824). He landed at Faza in early January 1844. On 6 January they moved towards Siyu, but were ambushed and forced back to Faza. After three weeks without a victory Amir Hemed sailed off. In 1845 Siyu gave Seyyid Said one of his greatest military defeats, in this battle the famous Amir Hemed was killed and was buried in Rasini where his grave exists to date. Seyyid Said used to pay tribute to his grave at Rasini every year. It is believed Amir Hemed was very swift with his sword to the extent of stopping all arrows and spears shot at him in battlefield. The soldiers of Siu knew about this and during this battle two archers from the Siu army shot two arrows at him in one second targeting his armpit. When Amir Hemed swiftly lifted his sword to stop the first arrow the second shot his chest from the arm pit. It was a poisoned arrow and it killed him instantly. Seyyid Said planned a revenge to avenge the death of his cousin. After a while he cheated almost all the rulers, advisors and generals of Siu into a diplomatic mission with him in Zanzibar, but he turned this into a massacre mission for the rulers of Siu. They were advised by the sultan to leave behind all their weapons since it was a diplomatic one. Upon arrival in Zanzibar, Seyyid Said individually asked every individual in the Siu mission the whereabouts of Amir Hemed and everybody who answered that he is dead was killed instantly by the Sultan. Some of the diplomats who answered that Amir Hemed is still alive were spared but they were imprisoned for life at fort Jesus in Mombasa which was also under the Sultan then. After the Sultan of Zanzibar massacred almost all the rulers of Siu, he forcefully arrested the ones remained in Siu town and deported them to Mombasa for imprisonment at fort Jesus along with the others who survived the Zanzibar Massacre. When Siyu finally succumbed to Zanzibar's dominance, under Sultan Majid in 1863, it was one of the last towns on the whole of the Swahili Coast to do so.Martin, 1973, p.23-24 Siyu Fort on Pate island Kizingitini Kizingitini is situated on the North coast (east of Faza) and is the largest fishing port on the island.

Shanga Shanga is an important archaeological site, situated on the South-East coast of the island. It was excavated during an eight-year period, starting in 1980. The earliest settlement was dated to the 8th century, and the conclusion drawn from archaeological evidence (locally minted coins, burials) indicate that a small number of local inhabitants were Muslim, probably from the late 8th century onwards, and at least from the early ninth.Horton, 1996, p. 421 The excavations also revealed a major break in the development of Shanga in the mid or late 11th century, with the destruction and the rebuilding of the Friday MosqueHorton, 1996, p.425 Horton relates this to the writing of the historian Jo√£o de Barros, about members of an Arab tribe, generally believed to be Qarmatians, who arrived at the Swahili coast. De Barros connects these new arrivals with a republican style of government.Horton, 1996, p.426de Barros, 1778, pp. 22, 29 Shanga was abandoned between 1400‚Äì1425; the event was recorded in both the History of Pate and in oral tradition. The Washanga (\\"the people of Shanga\\") consist of a clan who still live in the nearby Swahili town of Siyu.Brown 1985, 67, 71, quoted in Horton, 1996, p.5 Rezende's description of Siyu in 1634 states that \\"the kingdom of Sio has no king but is ruled by governors\\"Freeman-Grenville 1962, 181, quoted in Horton, 1996, p.426 Evidence of Chinese exploration In 1999, Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times reported a surprising encounter on the island of Pate. He found a village of stone huts. He talked to an elderly man living in the village who said that he was a descendant of Chinese explorers who were shipwrecked there centuries before. The Chinese had supposedly traded with the locals, and had even loaded giraffes onto their ship to take back to China. However, the Chinese ran aground on a nearby reef. Kristof found evidence that confirmed the man's story. Such evidence included the Asian features of the people in the village, plus Asian-looking porcelain artefacts.1492: The Prequel, Nicholas D. Kristof, 6 June 1999, New York TimesAncient Chinese Explorers, by Evan Hadingham National Geographic then published an article by Frank Viviano in July 2005. He had visited Pate island during the time he stayed on Lamu. Ceramic fragments had been found around Lamu, which the administrative officer of the local Swahili history museum claimed were of Chinese origin; specifically, from Zheng He's voyage to the Swahili Coast. The eyes of the Pate people resembled Chinese. Famao and Wei were some of the names among them which were speculated to be of Chinese origin. Their ancestors were said to be from indigenous women who intermarried with Chinese Ming sailors when they were shipwrecked. Two places on Pate were called \\"Old Shanga\\", and \\"New Shanga\\", which the Chinese sailors had named. A local guide who claimed descent from the Chinese showed Frank a graveyard made out of coral on the island, indicating that they were the graves of the Chinese sailors, which the author described as \\"virtually identical\\" to Chinese Ming dynasty tombs, complete with \\"half-moon domes\\" and \\"terraced entries\\".

Traditionally classified in Creodonta, this group may be related to pangolins. The group contains four subfamilies comprising thirteen genera. North American oxyaenids were the first creodonts to appear during the late Paleocene, while smaller radiations of oxyaenids in Europe and Asia occurred during the Eocene. They were superficially cat-like beasts that walked on flat feet, in contrast to modern cats, which walk and run on their toes. Anatomically, characteristic features include a short, broad skull, deep jaws, and teeth designed for crushing rather than shearing, as in the hyaenodonts or modern cats. Oxyaenids were specialized carnivores that preyed on other terrestrial vertebrates, eggs and insects. They were capable of climbing trees, which is suggested by fossil evidence of their paws.

Born in Central Hatillo, in what is now Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba Province, he batted and threw right handed and was listed as tall and .Baseball Reference website After spending all or part of four seasons with the New York Cubans of the Negro National League and two years at the Triple-A level of minor league baseball, Noble was 32 years old when he broke into the big leagues on April 18, 1951 with the New York Giants. The rookie was the Giants' second-string catcher that season, starting 26 games behind the plate (workhorse Wes Westrum started 119). He batted .234 with 33 hits, five home runs and 26 runs batted in; all were career highs. During that pennant-winning season, Noble was in the Giants' lineup as their catcher during the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series, when Bobby Thomson hit his famous home run. Noble handled no chances defensively in his one inning of work, and did not get a chance to bat. In the 1951 World Series that followed, he appeared in two games as a pinch hitter and defensive replacement and was hitless in two at bats. In the field, he caught three total innings in relief of Westrum and earned an assist when he threw out Gil McDougald of the New York Yankees for a caught stealing in the eighth inning of Game 6.Retrosheet box score: Game 6, 1951 World Series, 1951-10-10 Noble played for the Giants through the 1953 season, though he spent most of 1952 in the Open- Classification Pacific Coast League.

This taluk comprises 22 villages including 16 de-linked from the Taliparamba taluk and six from the Kannur taluk. The town is situated on the banks of the Perumba River. Location Payyanur is located 36 km North of District HQ Kannur, 501 km away from State capital Thiruvananthapuram, 301 km North of Ernakulam, 126 km North of Kozhikode, 56 km South of Kasaragod and 112 km away from Mangalore. Demographics According to the 2011 Indian census, Payyannur had a population of 72,111, with males constituting 46% of the population and females 54%. Payyannur has an average literacy rate of 94.08%. This is higher than the national average of 94.00%. Male literacy is 97.02%, and female literacy is 91.60%. In Payyannur, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. Etymology Payyannur derives its name from the renowned Sri Subrahmanya Swami Temple located here. Payyan is an appellation of Lord Subrahmanya and ooru means town or place. Thus Payyannur means the land of Lord Subrahmanya. Geography Payyannur is located at coordinates .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Payyanur It has an average elevation of 16 metres (51 feet). History Payyannur is one of several extant ancient civilized places in Kerala. The northern town of Kerala claims a rich recorded history. The archaeological remains excavated from Payyannur and nearby places prove the existence of a city in this area centuries ago. The earliest known mention of this town is in the Brahmanda Purana, when Garga Muni talks about this place to the Pandavas during their exile. Several notable travelers have described this area in their writings. Ibn Battuta visited Ezhimala in AD 1342 and wrote about the large seaport and the Chinese ships anchored here. Abul Fida in AD 1273, Marco Polo in AD 1293, the Italian explorer Niccol√≤ de' Conti in the 15th century and the Portuguese scholar and traveler Barbosa all visited this place and gave extensive accounts of Ezhimala port, which was then known as \\"Heli\\". The scholar and author Hermann Gundert and William Logan, the Malabar District Collector during the British Colonial rule, who wrote Malabar Manual, also visited Payyannur and studied the rich heritage of the area. Centuries back, Payyannur was a part of the Ezhimala/Mushika/Kolathiri Kingdom. King Nandan was well known as a great warrior and ruler. The books written during the Sangam period describe the area and King. Ezhimala was also under the rule of the Cheras. A famous ruler there was Pazhassi Raja. Payyannur Pattu, the ballad written by an unknown person belonging to the Chettiar community sometime during the 13th or 14th century, was set here. =Evolution of Payyannur= Payyannur Highway In the past, the city of Kachil Patanam (presently Kavvayi) was the main town due to the proximity of waterways through Kavvayi River and its large seaport. It was both the administrative and business center during that time. According to historians, the ships from China and other countries used to visit this port and were anchored in the nearby river Changoorichal. Kavvayi retained its position during the rule of British East India Company also. They established the first Magistrate's court and Registrar's Office in Kavvayi. Later, Kokkanisseri became the city center. The main road, which starts from Perumba, divided the town into two. The south of this road was called Payyannur village and the north Kokkanisseri village. The business center was called Kokkanisseri Bazaar. Later, the name Payyannur became common and thus the developed city of today came into existence. Subrahmanya swamy Temple pond During the regime of the Kolathiri Dynasty, Payyannur was a part of Kolathu Nadu, ruled by the Kolathiri Rajas based in Chirakkal near Kannur. During British rule, Payyannur was considered as a \\"farka\\" which in turn is a part of the Chirakkal Taluk. Until the formation of Kerala State in 1957, Payyannur remained in the Malabar District of the Madras State.

It was originally used by a congregation belonging to the Church of Norway, then the Evangelical Church of Prussia, and now serves the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland. The church is a four-post single-nave stave church originally built around 1200 in the parish of Vang in the Valdres region of Norway.  History  Drawing of the stave church from 1841 by F.W. Schiertz Original location of Vang Stave Church in Norway In 1832, the local council decided to pull down the stave church because it was too small and had become structurally unsafe over the years. The plans for its demolition and replacement were known already in 1826, when the painter Johan Christian Dahl made the first attempt to save it. He urged the council to repair and extend it. There was also an attempt to have it re-erected at Heens√•sen in the same parish as an annex church. Knut Nordsveen, a local farmer, offered to donate the building site to the community, but his offer was rejected. Disappointed by the rebuff, he later sold his farm and emigrated to America. In 1932, a monument was erected in memory of him. = Relocation = While traveling in Norway in 1839, Dahl again visited Vang. He found the stave church still standing, beside a newly built larger log-built church seating 230 parishioners. Demolition of the old one was imminent. Dahl was more than ever convinced that the stave church must be preserved as a cultural monument. He proposed without success to have it re-erected as a Royal Chapel in Christiania, or as a museum church adjacent to the medieval Haakon's Hall in Bergen. Count Herman Wedel Jarlsberg announced his willingness to place it in his park at Bogstad manor near Christiania, but he died before the plan could be carried out. Dahl saw no other way than to buy the church himself. He asked the vicar of Vang to bid on his behalf at the public auction held in January 1841. Dahl won the bid at 86 speciedaler, 1 ort and 7 skilling, on the condition that the site was cleared by the end of the year. Accused of being a speculant, Dahl defended himself by stating that his only intention was to rescue the church, and that he had no intention of making money from the deal. The solution came from Crown Prince, later King Frederick William IV of Prussia, whom Dahl knew personally. After the exchange of several letters, he persuaded the prince to take over responsibility for the Vang Stave Church and cover the costs of re-erecting it in Potsdam. The task of surveying the church, marking the materials, supervising the dismantling and preparing for the transportation was entrusted to the young German architect , who had helped Dahl to make the plates for his book on the stave churches, and who was probably also known to the Crown Prince. Schiertz did pioneering work in documentation and planning for an enterprise without precedent. His drawings and inventories are now priceless sources of knowledge about the original appearance of the stave church. All pieces were marked and packed for transportation during the summer. In September they were delivered at the harbour of L√¶rdals√∏yri at the head of the Sognefjord, where they were loaded on board the Haabet, bound for Stettin. Upon arrival in Stettin after two months at sea, the materials were transferred onto a barge for the last leg of the journey to Berlin, where they were stored during the winter in the courtyard of the Altes Museum. The original plan had been to re-erect the church on the Pfaueninsel (Peacock Island) near Potsdam. But in the meantime, this plan was discarded in favour of a site at the remote village of Br√ºckenberg near Krummh√ºbel in the Riesengebirge (Giant Mountains), now the Karkonosze mountains, in the province of Silesia. The idea probably came from countess Friederike von Reden of Buchwald, now Bukowiec, whose memorial stands beside the church. Count Christian Leopold von Schaffgotsch of Warmbrunn, now Cieplice, donated the site. In the spring of 1842 the materials were again taken by river barge up the Oder to the foothills, and from there by wagon to the mountain village of Krummh√ºbel. The new site for the church is above sea level in Br√ºckenberg, about halfway between Krummh√ºbel and the peak of the Mount Schneekoppe. = Re-erection = The foundation stone was laid on 2 August 1842 in the presence of King Friedrich Wilhelm himself. It was a demanding task for carpenters who had never seen the church, nor any stave church, to rebuild it correctly. In spite of excellent drawings, most of the materials were discarded. Only the main construction, consisting of sills, posts and wall plates, were made use of, in addition to the carved doorframes. All of the external gallery was built with new materials, and every wall plank was replaced. The long lost apse was reconstructed, albeit with a very strange baroque roof. The gallery and the fl√®che were reconstructed, but several new windows without historical precedent were put in. The doorways were turned inside out, with the carvings facing inward. The decorated ceiling above the choir was not restored, probably because it seemed too Catholic in a Protestant church. All the original roof trusses were renewed. The work took two years and the total cost amounted to more than 75 000 marks. On the King's birthday, 15 October 1843, the fl√®che with the date 1200 was raised. On 27 July 1844 Prince Frederick of the Netherlands together with huge crowds witnessed the consecration of \\"Die Bergkirche unseres Erl√∂sers zu Wang\\" (The mountain church of Our Savior of Vang). The former owner J. C. Dahl was not present, but he was happy to know that his project had been realised. He was spared the burden of preserving only certain decorated elements, and pleased that \\"a fair likeness\\" had been rebuilt. Now serving a Polish Lutheran community, Wang church has become a major tourist attraction and is probably the world's most visited stave church with about 200 000 visitors each year.  Original building  The layout with four internal posts or staves is common to several stave churches in the Valdres region. But in the stave churches of H√∏re and Lomen they are incorporated into a construction with a raised roof above the central part of the nave, whereas the churches of Vang and √òye have ordinary saddle roofs, with no structural connection between the roof and the interior posts. According to tradition, the church had been relocated once before at an earlier date, confirming the opinion of many scholars that it was much altered before leaving Vang. The Norwegian architect Arne Berg has after thorough examination of the rebuilt church concluded that the remaining original materials belonged to a stave church of the Sogn type with a raised roof above the central part of the nave. Dating evidence is, however, scant. He estimates it to have been built around 1200 ‚Äì confirming the rather dubious date inscribed in 1843. It may have been rebuilt already in the medieval period, but perhaps as late as 1600.  Runic inscription N 83  There is a runic inscription listed in Rundata as N 83 located on the doorway of the church, of which the expert Magnus Olsen has proposed the translation: \\" Eindridi the dexterous carved (the doorway), the son of Olav of Lo\\" (Old Norse: Eindri√∞i skar, mj√°fingr, sonr √ìlafs √° L√≥).Magnus Olsen, Norske innskrifter med de yngre runer, f√∏rste bind [Norwegian inscriptions with the younger runes, vol. 1] (Oslo, 1941), p. 231 If this is the correct interpretation, the inscription identifies the artist. His name was Eindridi, his nickname was \\"dexterous\\" or \\"handy\\", and his father was Olav of Lo. In 1937, the inscription was reported as badly damaged and hardly readable.

The game is the sequel to Cannon Fodder, a successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. The game is a combination of action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling through a time-travel scenario. The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed. The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies, their vehicles and installations. The game retained the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, as well as introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed at the lack of new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but lower scores than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty. Synopsis Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates ‚Äì destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion ‚Äì at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition. The player proceeds through 24 missions divided into several \\"phases\\" each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including medieval, gangster-themed Chicago, an alien spacecraft and an alien planet. The player must also contend with mines and other booby traps. As well as shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and- click control system more common to strategy than action games. As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas. In alternative settings, heavy weapons are replaced graphically by such units as battering rams (replaces trucks) and wizards (replaces rockets). The game's plot ‚Äì minimally expounded in the manual ‚Äì concerns soldiers partaking in a Middle Eastern conflict (which forms the game's early levels) abducted by aliens to do battle on an alien world (which forms the later levels). During the process of space travel, the aliens send the soldiers to various times and places, resulting in the intervening medieval and Chicago settings. Development The game is the sequel to Cannon Fodder, which drew criticism for its juxtaposition of war and humour and its use of iconography closely resembling the remembrance poppy. The cover art's poppy was ultimately replaced with a soldier, in turn replaced by a hand grenade for Cannon Fodder 2, regarding which Amiga Power joked: \\"the great thing about an explosive charge wrapped in hundreds of meters wound- inflicting wire is that it doesn't have the same child-frightening, 'responsible adult' freaking, society-disrupting effect as an iddy-biddy flower.\\" The One felt the new historical and science-fiction themes an attempt to avoid similar controversy as befell Cannon Fodder. Amiga Power itself had become embroiled in the controversy due to its planned use of the poppy on its cover (also abandoned) and perceived inflammatory commentary its editor Stuart Campbell. Campbell later left the magazine to join Sensible Software as a programmer and worked on the sequel as his first game. A small team of \\"essentially four\\" people ‚Äì among them first-time level-designer Campbell ‚Äì created the game, retaining the Cannon Fodder engine. Prior to Campbell's arrival from a journalism career, Sensible Software had devised the game's time-travelling theme and decided upon the various settings. However, it had not yet developed a plot to expound these themes. It was not possible to illustrate the story in the game itself ‚Äì due to Cannon Fodder 2's ‚Äì simple nature and so Campbell began work on an elaborate \\"plot-to-be\\", partially completing a novella intended to accompany the final product. This version of the story had the time-travelling aliens plotting to intervene in various parts of human history to create chaos, which they intended to exploit to enslave and destroy humanity. The protagonists' kidnappers were envisioned as sympathisers who would send them through time to defend mankind. However, Virgin vetoed the proposal as too expensive and took charge of the manual's production. The result was a simplified explanation which described the soldiers as in the employ of the aliens and did not clarify the time-travel element. Campbell later said the loss of the novella was an example of a publisher preferring to maximise profit from a game rather than build intellectual property towards the end of the Amiga's commercial life. As the game was to retain the same engine, the developers could not add new gameplay features. Campbell instead set out to make the levels more interesting, creating multiple paths through the missions. More obvious solutions would be more difficult, and the hidden, \\"proper\\" paths easier to execute once deduced. While Campbell intended the game to be harder, he also wished to improve the difficulty curve, which he argued was a flaw of its predecessor. He also tended to make the levels smaller and reduced instances of water obstacles, which he regarded as frustrating in the first game. The designer conceded that some levels turned out to be too difficult ‚Äì due to his inexperience as a developer and the fact he became so skilled while play testing ‚Äì but maintained that level 8 of the original was worse than any of his creations. Campbell named most of the game's levels after songs titles and lyrics (prominently The Jesus and Mary Chain), but also referenced wider pop culture artifacts such as gameshows and Bugs Bunny cartoons, as well as some original titles. He also referenced classic games in the level design itself. At the time, Creator Jon Hare said changing the formula would be detrimental, and unnecessary to provide enjoyment and value. He later reflected that Sensible had poorly managed the project in \\"delegating\\" the design to newcomer Campbell. He felt this to be a consequence of Sensible Software avariciously spreading itself thin, by that point attempting to exploit its success. Hare sold Sensible to Codemasters in 1999 and consequently worked on an abortive Cannon Fodder 3, with such a title ultimately published by Russia's Game Factory Interactive for the PC in 2012. Reception Cannon Fodder 2 retains the same mechanics and core gameplay of its predecessor, prompting reviewers to say: \\"It's still as wonderfully playable as it ever was\\", and to acknowledge \\"all the amazing control and playability\\" of the original. Reviewers complained about the lack of plot, with Amiga Power stating: \\"There's little explanation as to why you're doing this [time-travelling] and absolutely none in the game. As a result, the game doesn't hang together.\\" AUI called the plot \\"pointless\\", while Amiga Computing called it a \\"slight problem\\", saying \\"you have to guess what is going on in the game because there's no plot explanation [...] it's all very confusing!\\" The game is markedly more difficult than its predecessor. Amiga Format called this \\"good/bad news\\", whereas The One directed its \\"major criticism\\" at the difficulty level, saying \\"some of the levels are quite simply horrendous\\", and that the game is \\"close to being intensely frustrating at times.\\" Amiga Computing also felt the high difficulty to be the \\"biggest problem\\": \\"I like a game to get progressively harder rather than getting virtually impossible after just four missions.\\" Amiga Format also criticised the difficulty and felt \\"some of the levels are a bit of a drag.\\" Amiga Power was annoyed at the early tutorial missions, finding them redundant, but otherwise noted the increased challenge as a positive, and said: \\"The original game went in pulses of fiendishly hard and stupidly simple levels, but in CF2 the difficulty curve's, well, more of a curve.\\" The reviewer praised the clever level design, explaining: \\"The levels penalise you for taking the obvious route and reward you for trying an obscure approach [...] loads of levels make you think before you move, injecting puzzle elements into the killing\\", citing the example of traps with empty vehicles as bait. The reviewer praised the smaller, tighter levels with a difficulty curve within those levels: \\"gung-ho\\" sections building to tactical play against tougher enemies. He compared this favourably with the first game: \\"The level design is consistently better\\", in particular the \\"Beirut, Mediaevil and Chicago levels look and play wonderfully.\\" He nevertheless felt the thematic shifts lacked coherence and atmosphere. The player's soldiers find themselves on an alien planet The game's alien planet levels drew much criticism, on which Amiga Computing opined: \\"whoever chose the colour schemes should be thrown away in jail.\\" While he praised their mechanics, Amiga Power's reviewer said: \\"I hate the entire look of the alien planet [...] From the disgusting purple pools to the silly flowers.\\" Some reviewers enjoyed the graphics but felt there was no change between the two games. CU Amiga said \\"it's the same game tarted up with new graphics\\" as well as the new levels. Amiga Computing praised the new main theme music. Amiga Power said it was not as good as its predecessor and also pointed out that the in-game music remained the same as the original Cannon Fodder and had grown tiresome. The magazine questioned the lack of an option to disable it. Critics decried the lack of new weapons, pointing out that the original armaments and vehicles had merely been made to look different in the various settings, while behaving in the same manner. Reviewers more generally criticised the similarity between Cannon Fodder and Cannon Fodder 2. The One, AUI, and Amiga Computing compared the new game to a \\"data disk\\" rather than a full sequel. Kieron Gillen later reflected that it would be called a \\"semi-sequel\\" or \\"stand-alone add-on pack\\" if released today. CU Amiga conceded that the designers could have added little new to such a simple game without tampering with the basic, successful mechanics; Sensible Software was accused of \\"laziness\\" by The One, and of \\"greed\\" by AUI. While it awarded 90%, Amiga Power felt the game was poor value for money compared to the original, while CU Amiga said it was \\"still worth buying\\". AUI said the game was \\"a must\\" for those without the original, otherwise Cannon Fodder 2 is \\"basically exactly the same game as before\\", with the \\"saving grace\\" of new levels. Amiga Computing enjoyed the game but said it was not as good as expected and that there are \\"too many similarities and not enough differences to make this sequel a classic.\\" The One summarised: \\"If you've got CF1, love it, and want seconds, only harder, look no further ‚Äì but, if like myself you've played Cannon Fodder to death and would've liked to have seen the game developed in some way, I think you'll be a bit disappointed\\".

He was a political leader in the early days of Kentucky statehood. Bullitt's family had come to America as refugee French Huguenots in 1685. Arriving first in Maryland, part of the family settled in Prince William County, Virginia. Alexander was born there in 1761, the son of colonial planter Cuthbert Bullitt and Helen (Scott) Bullitt. His father was a leading lawyer in local and colonial affairs. Alexander's early schooling was directed at making him a lawyer. But his uncle Thomas Bullitt was a pioneer and military leader, involved with western exploration. In 1783 Alexander followed in his uncle's footsteps and moved to Kentucky. Settling in Kentucky  Bullitt settled first in an area that is now Shelby County but soon found the area too isolated, and subject to Indian attacks. His uncle Thomas had surveyed a town site in 1773 at the Falls of the Ohio, and in 1800 the Virginia legislature named it Louisville. Alexander bought 1000 acres (4 km¬≤) about 9 miles (14 km) south of there and began his farm again. He named the plantation Oxmoor, after the fictional farm in Tristram Shandy. In 1784 he made his first steps in Kentucky politics. He became an officer in the local militia, and met with others at Danville in a convention that first proposed a separation from Virginia. In August 1785, his neighbor, Colonel William Christian, who had been developing a neighboring property, brought his wife Anne (n√©e Henry) and family from Virginia. Two months later Alexander married their young daughter Priscilla. While this improved his political connections (her uncle was Patrick Henry), they were a devoted couple. They built Oxmoor Farm, starting the main house in 1787, and there they grew tobacco, hemp, and corn. They raised a family of four: William Christian, Anne, Helen Scott, Cuthbert on the farm. Political career  After Colonel Christian was killed in a skirmish with Indians in 1786, Bullitt became a major in the militia. He was made a trustee of the town of Louisville. In 1792 when the idea of Kentucky statehood was accepted, he was a delegate to the Convention (again in Danville) where he was on the committee that drafted the first state Constitution. With the new constitution in place, in June he was one of twelve men elected to the State Senate. He was elected its speaker, and served there until 1800. When a second state constitution was sought, in 1799, Bullitt presided at the convention that wrote it. This new constitution created the office of Lieutenant Governor and he was elected to that office in 1800 serving under Governor James Garrard. In 1804 Bullitt returned to private life and the full-time development of Oxmoor. After his first wife died in 1806, Bullitt remarried, to widow Mary Churchill Prather. They had two children, Thomas James and Mary (Polly). Henry Clay's last court case, concerned the will of Mary (Polly) Bullitt that was challenged by Alexander Scott Bullitt's two sonsdescribed in Henry Clay, the Essential American by David S. and Jeanne T. Heidler. He died at his home in 1816 and is buried in the family graveyard at Oxmoor. Bullitt County, Kentucky was named in his honor.

Life Born in Nuremberg, Enzensberger was one of the more enigmatic figures in German letters. Younger brother of the literary celebrity and political figure Hans Magnus Enzensberger, he maintained a relatively low media profile throughout his career, in spite of being embroiled in one of the more interesting literary scandals of early 70s Germany. From 1969 until 1994, Enzensberger held a post as Professor of English Literature at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He is today chiefly known in Germany for his 1963 translation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking-Glass. In 1970, Enzensberger became the only author ever to refuse the Literaturpreis der Stadt Bremen, offered in the wake of the publication of Gr√∂√üerer Versuch √ºber den Schmutz (translated by Sandra Morris and published by Calder & Boyars in 1972 as Smut: An Anatomy of Dirt). The book generated a furore when it was first published in Germany, not least due to its linking of personal cleanliness with totalitarianism. Smut is an experimental work in which dirt is described scientifically, personally and perversely by a panoply of narrative voices, including fragments from the anthropologist Mary Douglas alongside writers from Samuel Beckett through William S. Burroughs to Jean Genet. It has since then fallen into neglect and remains out of print in both English and German. He died in Munich in January 2009.

The opening of the Gospel of Saint John, with his Evangelist portrait. The Ostromir Gospels (Russian: –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ –ï–≤–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª–∏–µ) is the oldest dated East Slavic book. (Archeologists have dated the Novgorod Codex, a wax writing tablet with excerpts from the Psalms, discovered in 2000, to an earlier time range, but unlike the Ostromir Gospels it does not contain an explicit date.). The Ostromir Gospels was created by deacon Gregory for his patron, Posadnik Ostromir of Novgorod, in 1056 or 1057 (the year 6564, in his dating system), probably as a gift for a monastery.  The book  The book is an illuminated manuscript Gospel Book lectionary containing only feast-day and Sunday readings. It is written in a large uncial hand in two columns on 294 parchment sheets of the size 20 x 24 cm. Each page contains eighteen lines. The book is concluded by the scribe's notice about the circumstances of its creation. Three full page evangelist portraits survive, by two different artists, and many pages have decorative elements. The close resemblance between this and the equivalent pages in the Mstislav Lectionary suggests they are both based on a common prototype, now lost. The two artists who produced the evangelist portraits were both heavily influenced by Byzantine models, but the style of the portraits of Saints Mark and Luke seems to derive from Byzantine enamelled plaques rather than manuscripts. Ostromir Gospel More early Russian manuscripts have survived from Novgorod, which was never occupied by the Mongols, than any other centre.Popova, Olga, Russian Illuminated Manuscripts, Thames & Hudson, London (or Braziller NY), 1984, nos 1-5, & pp 5-9 Later history It is thought that the book was taken from one of Novgorod's monasteries to the personal collection of the Russian tsars in the Moscow Kremlin, where it was first registered in 1701. Peter the Great ordered it to be taken to St. Petersburg, where there was no mention of it until 1805, when it was discovered in the dressing room of the late Catherine the Great. The Gospels were deposited in the Imperial Public Library in St Petersburg, where it remains. Alexander Vostokov was the first to study it in depth, demonstrating that the Church Slavonic of the manuscript reflects the Old East Slavic linguistic background of the scribe. The first facsimile edition was published under Vostokov's supervision in 1843. In 1932, the gem-studded book- cover induced a plumber to break into a case, remove and steal the binding, and hide the parchments behind a bookcase. Although the book was quickly recovered, no replacement binding has been provided to date.

History Enns, Austria. Wooden shafts not preserved A good example of a plumbata head. The complete weapon would have the head fixed on a wooden shaft with fletching. The first examples seem to have been carried by the Ancient Greeks from about 500 BC onwards, but the best-known users were the late Roman and Byzantine armies. The earliest and best written source for these tactical weapons refers to a period around 300 AD, though the document was composed around 390-450 AD.http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/vegetius/index.php#b100 De Re Militari Book I: The Selection and Training of New Levies A second source, also from the late 4th century, is an anonymous treatise titled De Rebus Bellicis, which briefly discusses (so far archaeologically unattested) spiked plumbatae (plumbata tribolata), but which is also the only source that shows an image of what a plumbata looked like. The image shows what looks like a short arrow with a weight attached to the shaft. Although only later copies of the original manuscript exist, this is confirmed by the remains which have so far turned up in the archaeological record. A third source is the late 6th century Strategicon, written by the Byzantine emperor Maurice, who wrote about the martzobarboulon, a corruption of its Latin name martiobarbulum. Plumbatae etymologically contain plumbum, or lead, and can be translated \\"lead-weighted [darts]\\". Martiobarbuli in this translation is mattiobarbuli in the Latin, which is most likely an assimilation of Martio-barbuli, \\"little barbs of Mars\\". The barb implied a barbed head, and Mars was the god of war (among other things). Archaeology gives a clearer picture of martiobarbuli. The reference listed has an illustration of a find from Wroxeter identified as the head of a plumbata and a reconstruction of the complete weapon: a fletched dart with an iron head weighted with lead. The reconstruction seems entirely consistent with Vegetius' description. War darts were also used in Europe later in the Middle Ages.

It has a sweet, nutty taste similar to that of a pumpkin. It has tan-yellow skin and orange fleshy pulp with a compartment of seeds in the blossom end. When ripe, it turns increasingly deep orange, and becomes sweeter and richer. It is a good source of fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium; and it is a source of vitamin A. Although botanically a fruit, butternut squash is used culinarily as a vegetable that can be roasted, saut√©ed, toasted, pur√©ed for soups such as squash soup, or mashed to be used in casseroles, breads, muffins, and pies. The squash is also used as an alternative diet for Monarch butterfly caterpillars alongside cucumbers. It is part of the same squash family as ponca, waltham, pumpkin, and calabaza.  History  The word \\"squash\\" comes from the Narragansett word askutasquash, meaning \\"eaten raw or uncooked\\". Although Native people may have eaten some forms of squash without cooking, today most squash is eaten cooked. Native Americans believed that it had extreme nutritional properties and would bury their dead with it to sustain them on their final journey. The late-growing, less symmetrical, odd-shaped, rough or warty kinds, small to medium in size, but with long-keeping qualities and hard rinds, are usually called winter squash. =Spread from South and Central America= All three species of squashes and pumpkins are native to the Western Hemisphere. C. maxima, represented now by such varieties as Hubbard, Delicious, Marblehead, Boston Marrow, and Turks Turban, apparently originated in northern Argentina near the Andes, or in certain Andean valleys. At the time of the Spanish invasion it was found growing in such areas and has never since been found elsewhere except as evidently carried by man. Since this is a plant that requires a fair amount of hot weather for best growth, it has never become very well known in northern Europe, the British Isles, or in similar areas with short or cool summers. Only long-vining plants are known in this species. C. moschata, represented by such varieties as Cushaw and Winter Crookneck Squashes, and Japanese Pie and Large Cheese Pumpkins, is a long-vining plant native to Mexico and Central America. This species and C. pepo apparently originated in the same general area, Mexico and Central America. Both are important food plants of the natives, ranking next to maize and beans. The flowers and the mature seeds, as well as the flesh of the fruit, are eaten in some areas. Before the arrival of Europeans, C. moschata and C. pepo had been carried over all parts of North America where they could be grown, but they had not been carried into South America as had beans, which originated in the same general region. They were generally grown by American Natives all over what is now the United States. Many of these tribes, particularly in the West, still grow a diversity of hardy squashes and pumpkins not to be found in generic markets. Although winter squashes are grown in many lands today, they are relatively unimportant with few exceptions. They are grown extensively in tropical America, in Japan, in Northern Italy and in certain districts in the United States. The calabazas of the West Indies and the forms grown by the natives of present-day Mexico and Central America are not of uniform, pure varieties, but are extremely variable as to size, shape, and color. Since these species are normally cross-pollinated, it is difficult to keep a variety pure. Butternut squash however is modern variety of winter squash. It was developed by Charles Legget of Stow, Massachusetts in 1944. Attributes Butternut squash will store for two to three months. Some varieties will keep up to six months. They are best kept at with 50 percent humidity. For the best flavor, butternut squash should be left to cure for 2 months after harvest. =Nutrition= A 100g serving of butternut squash contains 45 calories, 11.69 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, 1 gram of protein, and negligible fat content and is a rich source of vitamin A and a moderate source of vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitamin E. It also contains moderate levels of magnesium and manganese. Butternut squash seeds have been cited for reducing social anxiety disorder within an hour of consumption in a double-blind trial.Michael Greger, M.D. (2015) How Not To Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease, p. 205. =Culinary uses= One of the most common ways to prepare butternut squash is roasting. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways. The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted. The seeds can even be roasted and pressed into an oil to create butternut squash seed oil. This oil can be used for roasting, cooking, on popcorn, or as a salad dressing. In Australia, it is regarded as a pumpkin, and is used interchangeably with other types of pumpkin. In South Africa, butternut squash is commonly used and often prepared as a soup or grilled whole. Grilled butternut is typically seasoned with spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon or stuffed (e.g. spinach and feta) before being wrapped in foil and grilled. Grilled butternut is often served as a side dish to braais (barbecues) and the soup as a starter dish. Butternuts were introduced commercially in New Zealand in the 1950s by brothers Arthur and David Harrison who were nurserymen and market gardeners in Otaki.

Kaun was born in Berlin, and completed his musical training in his native city. In 1886 (or 1887), he left Germany for the United States and settled in Milwaukee, which was home to a well- established German immigrant community . As the conductor of local choral societies such as the Milwaukee Liederkranz and the Milwaukee Men's Choir, Kaun quickly acquired an important influence over the city's musical life. He also taught at the conservatory, where his colleagues included Wilhelm Middelschulte. Kaun's eldest son, Bernhard Kaun, later became a composer of film scores in Hollywood. At the turn of the century, Kaun returned to Germany and continued his teaching in Berlin. Although he received numerous lucrative offers of employment from abroad, these inducements could not persuade him to leave Berlin a second time. In 1912, he was appointed to the Prussian Academy of Arts. He chronicled his eventful life in his autobiography Aus meinem Leben (From My Life). He died in Berlin. Kaun composed in a Romantic style for a wide range of genres, including operas, symphonies, tone poems, pieces for solo organ and piano, as well as works for other combinations of instruments. His opera Der Fremde was first performed at the Dresden Hofoper (now the Semperoper) on 23 February 1920, with a cast including Richard Tauber, Elisabeth Rethberg and Friedrich Plaschke, conducted by Fritz Reiner.

History  Named by local Rhenish (German Lutheran) missionaries, the town was founded in 1912 as a railway stop between Windhoek and Keetmanshoop and named after Maria, the wife of the first colonial settler of the area, Hermann Brandt. It was proclaimed a town in 1920 and a municipality in 1946. Mariental is home to a large number of Nama-speaking people, descendants of the early Khoi inhabitants of Namibia. The people of Mariental are known for their big smiles and hospitality. Geography =Hardap dam= The Hardap Dam, situated northwest of Mariental, is the largest dam in Namibia. It supplies the city with water and controls the flow of the Fish River which flows in a southerly direction past the town. Hardap Dam has a capacity of and a surface area of . Construction began in 1960 and completed in 1963. Before the dam was built, Mariental was flooded in 1923 and 1934. However, whenever dam sluices have to be opened fully due to good rains in the Fish River's catchment area, Mariental is still prone to floods, with reed grasses growing in the riverbed of Fish slowing down the flow of water and aggravating the danger. (Full information only in the print version) Floods after the commissioning of the dam occurred in 1972, 1974, 1976, 2000, and 2006. Since then, the dam's water level is kept at a maximum of 70% of its capacity to prevent both an overflow and an uncontrolled outflow through fully opened sluices. =Climate= Mariental has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh), with very hot summers and extremely warm winters (with warm days and cold nights). The average annual precipitation is .  Economy  The nearby Hardap Dam is the largest reservoir in Namibia and provides water for irrigation, making possible to cultivate animal fodder, as well as corn, fruits and vegetables. The town is surrounded by flourishing commercial farms which, due to the low annual rainfall in the area focus on game farming as well as sheep and ostrich farming which along with cattle farming remain popular in the region. Export grapes, cotton lucern and dairy farming is also sustained by irrigation from the Hardap Dam. A local ostrich abattoir used to cater for this increasingly important industry, but recently went bankrupt, and what survives of the karakul trade in the south is centered around Mariental. Sitting astride the main route into the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, Mariental also services the needs of farmers in these areas. Mariental also boasts some of the best safari and hunting experiences in Namibia at lodges like Lapa Lange and Anib Lodge. Available game include springbuck, blesbuck, giraffe, ostrich, leopard, zebra, kudu, gemsbuck, hartebeest, eland, blue- and black wildebeest. The German association ‚ÄúFahrr√§der f√ºr Afrika e.V.‚Äù (Bicycles for Africa) has built a ‚ÄúBicycle Empowerment Centre‚Äù in the town together with the Catholic Aids Action (CAA) and the Bicycling Empowerment Network (BEN) Namibia. Local people infected with the HI-virus were trained to repair and build bikes and also received the know-how to run the workshop on their own. Second-hand Bicycles are being sold at low prices to the inhabitants of the region, allowing easy travel and transportation, while the income from the workshops is also used to finance local aid projects. The project is supported by governmental agencies in Germany and Namibia. Politics Mariental is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats. The 2015 local authority election was won by the SWAPO party which gained six seats (1,325 votes). The remaining seat went to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 139 votes).

Mumbai Riots 1992 case The Bombay Riots usually refers to the riots in Mumbai, in December 1992 and January 1993, in which around 900 people died. The riots were mainly due to escalations of hostilities after large scale protests (which were initially peaceful, but eventually turned violent) by Muslims in reaction to the 1992 Babri Masjid Demolition By Hindu Karsevaks in Ayodhya. Srikrishna, then a relatively junior judge of the Bombay High Court, accepted the uphill task of investigating the causes of the riots, something that many of his colleagues had turned down. For five years, until 1998, he examined victims, witnesses, and alleged perpetrators. Detractors came initially from left-secular quarters who were wary of a judge who was a devout and practising Hindu. The commission was disbanded by the Shiv Sena-led government in January 1996 and on public opposition was later reconssions of Inquiry Act. As an Inquiry is not a court of law (even if it conducts proceedings like one) and the report of an inquiry is not binding on governments, Srikrishna's recommendations cannot be directly enforced. To this date, the recommendations of the Commission have neither been accepted nor acted upon by the Government of Maharashtra.

It emerged as a subdivision from the Principality of Anhalt from 1252 until 1468, when it fell to the Ascanian principality of Anhalt-Dessau. Recreated in 1603, Anhalt-Bernburg finally merged into the re-unified Duchy of Anhalt upon the extinction of the line in 1863. History Bernburg Castle It was created in 1252, when the Principality of Anhalt was partitioned among the sons of Henry I into Anhalt- Aschersleben, Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst. Bernburg was allotted to Henry's second son Bernhard I. When the line of Anhalt-Aschersleben became extinct in 1315, Prince Bernhard II of Anhalt-Bernburg claimed their territory, he could however not prevail against his cousin Albert, Bishop of Halberstadt. After the ruling family became extinct upon the death of Prince Bernhard VI in 1468, Anhalt-Bernburg was inherited by Prince George I of Anhalt-Dessau. With Anhalt-Dessau it was inherited by Prince Joachim Ernest of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1561, who unified all Anhalt lands under his rule in 1570. Re-united Anhalt was again divided in 1603 among Prince Joachim Ernest's sons into the lines of Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-K√∂then, Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau, Anhalt- Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst. His second son Prince Christian I took his residence at Bernburg. Christian's younger son Frederick established the separate Principality of Anhalt-Harzgerode in 1635, which existed until 1709. Prince Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg inherited Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau in 1665. Upon his death in 1718 his lands were further divided and the Principality of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym was created for his second son Lebrecht, which was reunited with Anhalt-Bernburg in 1812. In 1803 Prince Alexius Frederick Christian of Anhalt-Bernburg was elevated to the rank of a duke by Emperor Francis II of Habsburg. His son Duke Alexander Karl however died without issue in 1863, whereafter Anhalt-Bernburg was inherited by Leopold IV, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau, re-uniting all Anhalt lands under his rule.

Pandelis Pouliopoulos (Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒªŒÆœÇ Œ†ŒøœÖŒªŒπœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ; 10 March 1900, Thebes6 June 1943, near Larissa) was a Greek communist and one- time general secretary of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). He stood for the internationalist and revolutionary character of the communist movement. He is among the founders of the Trotskyist movement in Greece. Born in Thebes, Greece, Greece, Pouliopoulos enrolled at Athens University in 1919 to study law. In 1919, he joined the Socialist Labour Party of Greece (SEKE), the forerunner of the Communist Party of Greece. In 1920, he was conscripted to fight in the Greek-Turkish war of 1919-1922. He was arrested in 1922 for anti- war activity, but was freed with the end of the war. From 1923 to 1925, Pouliopoulos was prominent in the war veterans' movement and in 1924 was elected president of the Panhellenic Federation of Veterans.What the Veterans and Army Victims Demand at www.marxists.org In 1924, he was a party delegate to the fifth congress of the Comintern. Later that year, he became general secretary of the KKE. On 24 August 1925, Pouliopoulos, along with 23 others, was put on trial in Athens on charges of promoting the autonomy of Macedonia and Thrace.http://www.marxists.org/archive/pouliop/works/1940/05/commac.htm He gave a five-hour speech in his defence and the trial was adjourned. On 22 February 1926, the trial of the \\"autonomists\\" resumed. The charges were dropped, but instead of being released, the men were exiled to Anafi, Amorgos and Folegandros islands. Pouliopoulos was taken to Folegandros island. He was freed in 1926 with the fall of the Pangalos dictatorship. Although he resigned in September 1926 after his leadership was blamed for the poor performance of the party, he was reinstated by the Comintern. At the party's congress in March 1927, Pouliopoulos (along with Pastias Giatsopoulos) was removed from the Central Committee. Later that year, they were formally expelled from the party after publishing and circulating the pamphlet New Beginning (Greek: Neo Ksekinima).A Political Villainy at www.marxists.org They subsequently formed an opposition group which aligned itself with the International Left Opposition. They began to publish a journal called Spartacus from December 1928 onwards. They refused to join the Archeiomarxists group which split from the KKE, regarding it as having a sectarian attitude towards the party. When the Archeiomarxists were accepted as the representatives of the International Left Opposition in Greece, Leon Trotsky condemned Pouliopoulos' group, which was excluded from the Trotskyist movement along with the 'Fractionalists' who had just split from the Archeiomarxists led by Michel Pablo. In 1934, the two groups joined together to set up the Organisation of Internationalist Communists of Greece (OKDE) in 1934, and for a while Pouliopoulos maintained links with other opposition groups around Landau and Molinier, opposing the movement to create a new International from 1933 onwards. However, he took the initiative in the move to unite the Greek Trotskyists in 1938 to form the Unified Organisation of Communist Internationalists of Greece (EOKDE). In September 1938, the EOKDE was present at the founding of the Fourth International in Paris. In 1938, after going into hiding, he was eventually arrested by the Metaxas dictatorship and imprisoned in the Acronauplia, where he continued his work. In 1943, along with over a hundred other militants, he was executed by the Italian occupation forces in Nezero, near Larissa, in retaliation for the destruction by partisans of the Kournovo tunnel. There is a postwar claim that he spoke in Italian to the firing squad, exhorting them not to commit such a crime against the anti-fascist resistance and opponents of the war. When the soldiers refused to execute him, the Carabinieri are said to have been given the task. Pouliopoulos translated into Greek Marx's Das Kapital and Critique of Political Economy, L. Trotsky‚Äôs The Revolution Betrayed, K. Kautsky‚Äôs Economic Theories of Karl Marx and Kant and also N. Bukharin‚Äôs History of Historical Materialism.

The bridge is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). The Macombs Dam Bridge connects the intersection of 155th Street and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Boulevard (Seventh Avenue), located in Manhattan, with the intersection of Jerome Avenue and 161st Street, located near Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The 155th Street Viaduct, one of the bridge's approaches in Manhattan, carries traffic on 155th Street from Seventh Avenue to the intersection with Edgecombe Avenue and St. Nicholas Place. The bridge is long in total, with four vehicular lanes and two sidewalks. The first bridge at the site was constructed in 1814 as a true dam called Macombs Dam. Because of complaints about the dam's impact on the Harlem River's navigability, the dam was demolished in 1858 and replaced three years later with a wooden swing bridge called the Central Bridge, which required frequent maintenance. The current steel span was built between 1892 and 1895, while the 155th Street Viaduct was built from 1890 to 1893; both were designed by Alfred Pancoast Boller. The Macombs Dam Bridge is the third-oldest major bridge still operating in New York City, and along with the 155th Street Viaduct, was designated a New York City Landmark in January 1992. Description The Macombs Dam Bridge was named after Robert Macomb, the son of merchant Alexander Macomb. It is composed of an over-water span and the 155th Street Viaduct, both of which were designed by consulting engineer Alfred Pancoast Boller. The bridge's total length is , including its approach viaducts. = Over-river span = end piers The Macombs Dam Bridge includes a swing bridge over the Harlem River, pivoting around a small masonry island in the middle of the river. The swinging span is the oldest remaining swing bridge in New York City that retains its original span. According to the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), which maintains the bridge, it is the city's third-oldest major bridge still in operation. It is variously cited as being long. It has four lanes for vehicular traffic and a sidewalk on each side for pedestrians. The roadway measures wide and the sidewalks measure wide. The total width of the deck, including additional space for supports and railings, is . The span's trusswork consists of concave chords running along the top. The chords taper up toward a square section in the center of the span, which is topped by four finials. On the Manhattan side, there is a plaque stating the year 1894, the words \\"Central Bridge\\", and the name of the bridge's major engineers. The design has been compared to a \\"raffish tiara\\" due to the presence of the Gothic Revival-style abutments. The span is located between two pairs of stone end piers with shelter houses. The shelter houses contain red tile roofs and are used by the bridge tender. Latticework gates are located near these end piers, blocking off access to the span when it is in the \\"open\\" position. Many of the original railings have been replaced. The swing span can be rotated around a tower located below the center of the deck, which in turn is located on the small masonry island. On both sides of the island are shipping channels with of horizontal clearance. When closed, the bridge provides of vertical clearance. The swinging portion weighs and is turned by two concentric drums: the inner drum has a diameter of and the outer has a diameter of . At the time of its construction, Macombs Dam Bridge's over-river span was said to be among the largest drawbridges built to date, or the heaviest movable mass in the world. = Viaducts = There are three approaches to the bridge. Two are from the Manhattan side (the 155th Street Viaduct and the Seventh Avenue approach), while the third leads to the intersection of Jerome Avenue and 161st Street in the Bronx.  155th Street Viaduct  The 155th Street Viaduct, as seen from the lower section of 155th Street At the western end of the over-water span is a long steel viaduct, carrying two sidewalks and two lanes of traffic in each direction. The viaduct stretches from the intersection of 155th Street, Edgecombe Avenue, and St. Nicholas Place, at its western end, to the intersection of Macombs Place, Macombs Dam Bridge, and Seventh Avenue (also Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard) at its eastern end. There are traffic lights at both ends of the 155th Street Viaduct. An unconnected lower section of 155th Street runs at ground level under the viaduct. The viaduct stretches was built due to the presence of Coogan's Bluff at its western end, some above the river. It passes over an unconnected section of 155th Street located at the bottom of the cliff. The viaduct is supported by 31 girders; the western 22 girders contain horizontal, diagonal, and vertical bracing, while the eastern 9 girders do not contain bracing. The extreme western end of the viaduct is located on a granite and limestone abutment; the roadway retains its original ornamental iron railings designed by Hecla Iron Works, with a tall chain-link fence above. The rest of the viaduct contains utilitarian metal railings and tall chain-link fences. The viaduct was designed similar to a landscaped boulevard or parkway, with observation decks projecting outward from the viaduct's sidewalks. Additionally, four long metal staircases originally connected the viaduct and the lower level of 155th Street; these stairs had canopies covering their upper flights. By 1992, only two of these stairs remained on the west side of Eighth Avenue, and by 2000, both remaining stairs had deteriorated too severely to be restored. On the western end of the viaduct, a stone staircase connects the north sidewalk of the viaduct and the lower section of 155th Street. A column with a weather vane, lamp, and drinking fountain is located at the western end of the viaduct. The fountain‚Äîsometimes called the Hooper Fountain after its donor, businessman John Hooper‚Äîstill exists on the southeast corner of the 155th Street Viaduct and Edgecombe Avenue. Before the viaduct was built, the 155th Street station of the elevated IRT Ninth Avenue Line, located along Eighth Avenue at the bottom of the cliff, could only be reached from the top by a long staircase. A Scientific American magazine article in 1890 stated that \\"To draw a load up the hill a team has to be taken a mile or more to the south\\".  Seventh Avenue approach  The other approach viaduct to the over-water span is from Seventh Avenue and Macombs Place (formerly Macombs Dam Road). It is long. The approach ramp is carried by several steel plate girders, as well as three Warren truss spans on the approach's southern side, which are carried by box girders. Part of the approach ramp is carried on an abutment pier, which contains a limestone-and- granite facade. A stairway leads from the Seventh Avenue approach's western sidewalk to the lower level of 155th Street; a corresponding stair on the eastern sidewalk of Macombs Place was demolished when the Seventh Avenue ramp was rebuilt in 1930. As originally laid out, Macombs Place provided access to Eighth Avenue (Frederick Douglass Boulevard), which was located at the bottom of Coogan's Bluff and was bypassed by the viaduct. Original plans did not provide for a connection to Seventh Avenue, but a curved ramp to Seventh Avenue was added by the time the bridge was opened. The approach was rebuilt in 1931 to provide direct access to Seventh Avenue. , it provides access to southbound Macombs Place and both directions of Seventh Avenue. At 152nd Street, a connecting road descends from the median of Seventh Avenue, connecting to the lower section of 155th Street.  Bronx approach  left At the eastern end of the over-water span, there are two Warren truss spans, followed by a camelback span over the tracks of the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line. Past the camelback span, the bridge intersects with the on- and off-ramps to and from the southbound Major Deegan Expressway. To the northeast, a steel approach road leads to Jerome Avenue, which extends north into the Bronx and Westchester County, and there are cloverleaf ramps to and from the northbound Major Deegan Expressway. The approach road consists of six steel-and-concrete spans across the expressway, as well as six more Warren trusses. These spans are supported by girders located atop granite piers. The approach road contains another intersection, with 161st Street, before terminating at Jerome Avenue. The grade of the approach road is 1%. History = Context = Macombs Dam and Bridge Robert Macomb, portrait by Edward Greene Malbone The original river crossing on the site was called Macombs Dam and was built along with the since-demolished lock-and-dam system on the Harlem River. The dam was opened in 1814, and the bridge was finished in 1815 or 1816. Macombs Dam's capacity was limited by its narrow width, as the manned lock only measured , and by the mid-19th century, no longer used as a dam. In one incident in September 1839, local residents breached the dam over several days, and their actions were later reinforced by New York Supreme Court despite the operator's objections. Following legislature passed by the city in 1858, the dam was demolished that year, and was mandated to be replaced with a swing bridge. The wooden Central Bridge, a swing bridge across the Harlem River, followed in 1860 or 1861. The span's construction was initially supposed to cost $10,000, but ultimately cost nine times as much. The wooden swing bridge included a rotating square tower situated atop a small island in the center of the river; the span itself was supported by iron rods attached to the tower. Because of the number of wooden parts, it often required maintenance. The city held a contest in 1875 for the installation of \\"a new wooden draw\\" to replace the existing Central Bridge. In 1877, the swinging component's square-shaped frame was removed and an A-frame was installed. The approach spans were subsequently replaced with iron in 1883, and the wooden span was rebuilt in 1890. The rebuilt span was long and wide, with two sidewalks, as well as approach ramps measuring long. These improvements did not help the public's reputation of the bridge, and one driver was quoted as saying, \\"They ought to keep it for clam wagons, though no clam with any regard for himself would ever cross the bridge.\\" By the late 1880s, landowners in Upper Manhattan were advocating for development of Washington Heights, the then-sparsely-populated area atop Coogan's Bluff, the high cliff to the west of Macombs Dam. At the time, there were few options for traveling between the top and bottom of Coogan's Bluff. Another reason for developing this region of Manhattan was the opening of the Polo Grounds stadium at the bottom of Coogan's Bluff in 1890. By 1886, local landowners had come to an agreement that a viaduct was needed to connect the top of Coogan's Bluff and the Central Bridge. The next year, the New York state legislature passed a law that enabled the construction of a viaduct connecting the high point of Coogan's Bluff to the Central Bridge. Around the same time, the Central Bridge was slated to be rebuilt as a result of the River and Harbor Act, passed by the United States Congress in 1890. As part of the act, bridges on the Harlem River with low vertical clearance were to be replaced with those with at least of clearance during mean high water springs. Drawbridges and swing spans were determined to be most suitable for this purpose. = Construction = Rare edition of Scientific American magazine issued in 1892 to praise the great engineering projects of New York City. The 155th Street Viaduct is at lower right Structural engineer Alfred Pancoast Boller was hired to design the viaduct; his plans were officially approved in May 1890 at an estimated cost of $514,000, to be split evenly between the city and landowners. The city hired Herbert Steward to be the contractor; the Union Bridge Company for structural steel; and Hecla Iron Works for iron ornamentation. In June 1890, Boller was also hired for the over-water span. Boller submitted his plans for the over-water span that November; the plans entailed a smaller approach viaduct in the Bronx to cross over the swamp on that side. Work on the 155th Street Viaduct began in December 1890. At the end of 1891, the foundations for the 155th Street Viaduct's support structure, as well as the masonry abutment at the viaduct's western end, had been constructed. However, further work at the viaduct's east end was delayed until the over-water span's foundations could be laid. The contract for the over- water span and Bronx approach was given to the Passaic Rolling Mill Company in March 1892, and work on that segment began two months later. The contractors and suppliers for the 155th Street Viaduct were also contracted for the over- water span. As the old bridge was about to be closed, residents of the town of Tremont, Bronx, expressed concerns that one of their few links to Manhattan would be temporarily severed. Ultimately, the old drawbridge was floated slightly north to 156th Street while the new span was constructed immediately adjacent. The old bridge remained there until the new span was completed, at which point the old span was demolished. After the height of the over-water span's deck had been established, two falsework rails were placed on the outer edges of the span, along which a rolling scaffold traveled. Two different methods were used to construct the foundations for the over-water span. A caisson was used for the western bank's pier and the central pivoting \\"island\\", while a cofferdam was used for the eastern bank's pier. The latter required a modification to the original contract \\"owing to the great depth of swampy bottom\\". The design of the short span over the Hudson Line railroad tracks was likely also changed when the contract modification was made. By late 1892, the 155th Street Viaduct was nearly completed and the Real Estate Record stated that pedestrians were already using the viaduct to access the elevated line. However, there were disputes over the ramp between Seventh Avenue and the over-water span. In the initial plans, the 155th Street Viaduct lacked a direct connection to Seventh Avenue. A rocky outcropping obstructed the line of view between Seventh Avenue and the bridge, so the builders decided to destroy the rock. The city also acquired land for a park between Macombs Dam Road, Seventh Avenue, and 153rd Street. Additionally, there were problems in coordinating work on the viaduct and over-water span, since the two segments intersected at an angle. An additional contract for a second Bronx approach from Sedgwick and Ogden Avenues was designed by Boller in January 1893, and was approved by the New York State Legislature. In 1894, the contract for the second Bronx approach was awarded to Passaic, while the contract for the over-water span's ornamentation was given to Valentine Cook & Son. = Use = left The 155th Street Viaduct opened on October 10, 1893. The over-water span opened \\"without any particular ceremony\\" a year and a half later, on May 1, 1895. The viaduct cost $739,000 (about $ million in ), while the over-water span cost $1.3 million (equal to $ million in ); however, the total cost of the over-water span including land acquisition was $1.774 million (about $ million in ). The new bridge was also called the Central Bridge, and though a plaque bearing this name still can be seen on the swing span, the name never stuck. The old \\"Macombs Dam\\" name remained in popular use, and the bridge was officially renamed with its original moniker in 1902. The 155th Street Viaduct and over-water span were formerly operated by two different entities. The over-water span was erected by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation before being transferred to the Bridge Department in 1898, while the 155th Street Viaduct was erected by the Department of Public Works and was transferred to the Manhattan borough president's office in 1898. A trolley franchise was awarded to the Union Railroad Company in 1903, providing Bronx residents with a direct connection to the Eighth Avenue trolley. The first trolley traveled over the Macombs Dam Bridge in 1904. Due to the increasing prevalence of trolleys and automobiles, there was a decrease in horse-drawn carriages that used the bridge. Also in 1904, the steam engine that powered the movable over-water span was replaced with a electric motor, which itself was replaced with a motor in 1917. The New York City Department of Plant and Structures assumed control of the over-water span in 1916, and five years later it also had jurisdiction of the 155th Street Viaduct. In 1920, while Yankee Stadium was under construction, ramps were built on the Bronx side of the Macombs Dam Bridge, leading to 161st Street. As part of this project, the staircase on the northern facade of the Bronx abutment was demolished, and a corresponding stair on the southern facade was built. On the Manhattan side, a rebuilt approach from Seventh Avenue and 151st Street to the bridge, as well as a rebuilt triangular plaza between Seventh Avenue and Macombs Dam Road, was opened in 1931. The approach was built on land donated by John D. Rockefeller Jr. The new approach, designed by Andrew J. Thomas, entailed rebuilding the formerly-straight Macombs Dam Road approach to a \\"flared polygonal\\" route, which required extending the masonry abutment there. In 1938, both the over-water span and the viaduct became the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works. Part of the pedestrian railing was damaged in 1949 after a boat's boom ran into the over-water span. Around the same time, from 1949 through 1951, the approach to Ogden and Sedgwick Avenues in the Bronx was demolished to make way for the construction of the Major Deegan Expressway. Three segments of truss bridge were also removed during this time, and the removed truss segment over the expressway's path was replaced with a new steel deck. The trolley tracks were also removed , and many of the original decorative and lighting fixtures were replaced in the early 1960s. The Transportation Administration assumed control of the bridge and viaduct in 1966. A new interchange on the Bronx side opened in 1977, providing easier access to Yankee Stadium. The same year, jurisdiction passed to the NYCDOT, which still operates and maintains the bridge and viaduct. By 1988, the NYCDOT listed the Macombs Dam Bridge as one of 17 bridges citywide that urgently needed restoration. The work, initially expected to cost $34 million, would pay for the restoration of steel brackets and deteriorated concrete supports. The NYCDOT opted to restore all aspects of the bridge, so the agency began a $145 million overhaul in 1999 and completed it in 2004. As part of the renovation, the NYCDOT replaced the deck of the bridge, and renovated the structural elements of the approach viaducts and the four ramps to and from the Major Deegan Expressway. The over-water span was also repainted and the electrical systems were replaced. Simultaneously, the NYCDOT also assessed the Macombs Dam Bridge and 155th Street Viaduct for a seismic-retrofitting project, which at the time was slated to be completed between 2010 and 2013 for $36 million. Despite the low probability of earthquakes in the area, the project had been proposed after more stringent building codes had been implemented in 2003. Transportation , the Macombs Dam Bridge carries New York City Transit's bus routes. In 2016, the New York City Department of Transportation reported an average daily traffic volume in both directions of 38,183, with a peak of 55,609 in 1957.  Critical reception  Macomb's Dam Bridge (1935) by Edward Hopper Even while under construction, the Macombs Dam Bridge and the 155th Street Viaduct were favorably appraised by contemporary media. Scientific American praised the design of the ornamental iron handrails and lampposts in 1890. Two years later, the Engineering News-Record said that the two structures comprised \\"two of the parts of a grand system of improvements which will [...] transform that section of the city of New York.\\" In 1895, after the bridge was completed, the Real Estate Record called the bridge \\"a beautiful piece of engineering work splendidly conceived.\\" Bridge engineer Martin Gay praised the masonry's \\"fine lines\\" and the \\"graceful sweep\\" of the over-water span's upper chord in 1904. Architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler stated that the Macombs Dam Bridge was \\"the most pretentious and costly\\" of the Harlem River swing bridges, and that the Macombs Dam and University Heights Bridges were \\"highly creditable works, in an artistic as well as in a scientific sense.\\" The writer Sharon Reier, in the book \\"The Bridges of New York\\", referred to the Macombs Dam Bridge and the University Heights Bridge as \\"the only movable bridge[s] across the Harlem [...] which warrants a walking tour\\". After Boller's death in 1912, a colleague wrote that the Macombs Dam Bridge was one of several spans designed by Boller that were \\"characterized by their originality and boldness of design\\". The painter Edward Hopper depicted the bridge in a 1935 painting of the same name.  Similar spans  The Putnam Bridge, which was similar in design to the Macombs Dam Bridge Boller designed several bridges across the surrounding section of the Harlem River. Two of them were built to the south of the Macombs Dam Bridge. These spans were the 145th Street Bridge and the Madison Avenue Bridge, which originally opened in 1905 and 1910, respectively. Though the 145th Street Bridge was replaced in 2006, writer Sharon Reier had described the original 145th Street Bridge as an \\"uninspired copy\\" of the Macombs Dam Bridge. Immediately to the north of the Macombs Dam Bridge was the Putnam Bridge, also designed by Boller. The New York City Subway's now- demolished Ninth Avenue elevated line ran over the bridge, connecting with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (current ). The bridge opened in 1880, and was demolished after that portion of the Ninth Avenue line stopped operating in 1958.

It is also an uncommon resident of the Southern Bahamas. Populations east of the Andes in South America are now usually regarded a separate species, the flat-faced fruit-eating bat (A. planirostris). The distinctive features of the Jamaican fruit bat (which however are shared by some of its relatives) include the absence of an external tail and a minimal, U-shaped interfemoral membrane. Description Closeup of head of Jamaican fruit bat The Jamaican fruit bat is a medium-sized bat, having a total length of with a wingspan and weighing . It has broad but pointed and ridged ears with a serrated tragus. Its prominent noseleaf has an array of sebaceous glands. The lower lip is littered with warts with a relatively large one in the center. Sebaceous holocrine glands can be found in both lips. On the back the fur is an ashy-shade of gray or brown with visible white hair bases and variable fur patterning on the face. The wings of the fruit bat are broad and dark gray in color. The underfur is paler in color. The fruit bat has no external tail. It has broad dark grey wings and a narrow hairless interfemoral membrane with a short calcar. A transcriptome dataset is available with more than 25,000 annotated transcripts that are directly searchable by BLAST.BlastPrimer A genome assembly has also been generated.nih.govBLAST Ecology The Jamaican fruit bat ranges from southern Mexico southward to northwestern South America (west Colombia, west Ecuador and northwest Peru). It also lives on the islands of Trinidad, Tobago, Greater and Lesser Antilles and the Florida Keys.Redford K. H., J. F. Eisenberg. 1992. Mammals of the Neotropics: The southern cone, University of Chicago Press, 2:1-430. Populations east of the Andes in South America (south to Argentina) have traditionally been included in the Jamaican fruit bat, but are now often regarded as a separate species, the flat-faced fruit-eating bat (A. planirostris). Further research is necessary to establish its exact taxonomic status. The Jamaican fruit bat can be found in elevations from sea level to .Eisenberg. 1989. Mammals of the Neotropics: The northern Neotropics, University of Chicago 1:1-449. This species is found in a variety of habitats. It prefers habitats that are humid and tropical but has also adapted to cloud forests and drier tropical habitats. Fruit bats roost in caves, hollow trees, dense foliage, buildings and leaf tents.Timm R. M. 1987. Tent construction by bat of the genera Artibeus and Uroderma. Pp 187-212 in Studies in Neotropical Mammalogy, essays in honor of Philip Hershkovitz (B. D. Patterson and R. M. Timm, eds.) Fieldiana Zoology, New Series 39:1-506. The fruit bat may create its own \\"tent\\" to roost in by altering broad leaves. These \\"tents\\" are only temporarily used. The Jamaican fruit bat is a frugivore. They eat a number of kinds of fruit but focus mostly on figs; at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, figs make up more than 78% of the fruits eaten. Bats will also supplement leaves of plants with high amounts of protein. Overall, the fruit bat consumes a diverse amount of plants but locally only eats certain types. A Jamaican fruit-eating bat plucks its food and carries it away with its mouth before eating it in its roosts. As such it can disperse seeds fairly far. Fruit bats have been recorded carrying fruits weighing or even as much as . Jamaican fruit bats rely on sight and smell to find fruit of certain colors and odors. The maximum longevity for the Jamaican fruit bat is nine years in the wild. Predators of fruits bats include owls, snakes, large opossums, and coati. Bats from various sites have been found with Histoplasma capsulatum. Some individual bats may have rabies.Constantine D. G. 1988. Health precautions for bat researchers. pp. 491‚Äì528 in Ecological and behavioral methods for the study of bats (T. H. Kunz ed) Smithsonian Institution Press. Fruit bats also are susceptible to various internal parasites: nematodes and ringworms, and external parasites: mites, ticks and chiggers. Behavior and life history A Jamaican fruit bats hanging from a tree When in their roosts, the Jamaican fruit bat has a reproductive system known as \\"resource defensive polygyny\\". That is, males will claim an area as a territory and females select the best territories to roost and mate in. Subadult males may remain in their natal roosts while females may leave to gather with other females elsewhere.Morrison D. W., C. O. Handley Jr. 1991. Roosting behavior. Pp. 131-136 in Demography and natural history of the common fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (C. O. Handley Jr, D. E. Wilson and A. L. Gardner, eds.) Smithsonian Institution Press. In caves where there are enough roosting sites, there is some \\"female defensive polygyny\\". Here, harem males actively defend females during the breeding seasons and will attack satellite males that roost in the walls and ceilings of caves. However, they tolerate males who are subordinate to them in their harems. Satellite males are more common in large groups than smaller groups and dominant and subordinate males will cooperate to defend harem females. In large groups, dominant males may be the fathers of the subordinates. When bats going on foraging trips, it is the dominant males that are the first to leave to the roosting sites and the last to return. At dusk, males spend much time flying near the tree roosts displacing any intruders.Flight speeds of tropical forest bats, The American Midland Naturalist 104:189-192. Jamaican fruit bats are most active at midnight; following that, activity begins to die down.Fenton M. B., T. H. Kunz. 1977. Movements and behavior Pp. 351-364 in Biology of the bats of the New World family Phyllostomatidae. Part II (R. J. Baker, J. K. Jones, D. C. Carter, eds). Special Publications, The Museum, Texas Tech University Press 13:1-364. When captured, a Jamaican fruit bat will warn conspecifics with a distress call made of a long series of pulses typically lasting 15 kHz. The Jamaican fruit bat will also react to the distress calls of other species and to their own recorded calls. The fruit bat is considered a whisper bat and makes 3 low-intensity FM pulses during flight and when resting. Breeding in the Jamaican fruit bat that is bimodal and polyestrous with births being dependent on fruit abundance. Females give birth twice a year with one young on average for each birth. Mating is highest at the end of the wet season and births take place in the dry months. Embryonic development may delay in the second breeding season but parturition will occur in the follow breeding period. The testes of the males enlarge when females enter estrous. The testes tend to be slightly larger in harem males than bachelors and the canine teeth tend to be more worn in the former. Copulation occurs until 2‚Äì25 days after the previous births. Pups born in a harem may sometimes be sired by satellite or subordinate males depending on the size of the group. Gestation is usually 3.5‚Äì4 months but can be as long as 7 months when there's delayed embryonic development. The female gives birth while perching and the newborn emerges unaided, head first. The mothers will eat the placenta. Mothers carry their pups when they are one day old but later leave them in the roosting area for the day. The female‚Äôs nipples become enlarged during lactation. Young are weaned by 15 days. Young gain a full, permanent set of teeth at 40 days and can fly by 50 days when their forearms are fully developed. Females are sexually mature by eight months and males by 12 months. Status Throughout most of its range, the Jamaican fruit bat is numerous. It was found to be the most influential of the frugivorous bat community.Gardner A. L., C. O. Handley Jr., D. E. Wilson. 1991. Survival and relative abundance. Pp. 53-76 in Demography and natural history of the common fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Handley Jr., D. E. Wilson, ed). Smithsonian Institution Press. The fruit bat has greater ecological importance in wet habitats. The Jamaican fruit eating bat does not seem to be threatened from a conservation standpoint. It appears to be common regardless of any habitat disruption. However, it may damage fruit crops in certain areas.

It was also ported for the SNES by Bullet-Proof Software. Gameplay In-game screenshot Obitus combines several graphical styles and perspectives in a labyrinth-base game. Though nearly every piece of a forest or catacomb looks indistinguishable from the next screen, this can be dealt with by the player making physical maps, using the compass. The game is heavily focused on the need to make maps. Without them, the player will die long before making it to the end. There is very little food and time cannot be wasted walking around trying to find a way forward. Plot The player takes on the role of medieval history lecturer Wil Mason, whose car breaks down while he drives through Snowdonia, Wales in a storm. He seeks refuge in a deserted tower, only to wake up in a strange world. King Cullen passed control of the peaceful land Obitus to his four sons, warning them to stand united or the land would fall into evil hands. To symbolise the unity, the king gave each of his sons a Gem of Tranquility, which when joined conjured a mystical force to protect the land. Some time after the transfer of power took place, an evil sorceress sought to take advantage of the princes' fraternal pact. She told them each in confidence that they must break from the others in order to obtain personal wealth and power. The princes took these words to heart and fought for control of the kingdom. When the battle was over, each prince had one of the gems and one quarter of the land, and the power of the gems had been broken. Only by reuniting them in the Tower Obitus can the kingdom be saved. Reception Allen L. Greenberg of Computer Gaming World liked the no-typing interface, graphics, and sound, but stated that the documentation was so poor that players would be better off not reading it. Despite stating that the game lacked depth, the magazine stated that Obitus \\"can be a satisfying experience\\" that \\"offers many hours of exploration and danger, and plenty to see\\". David Upchurch of ACE gave the Amiga version a score of 830 (out of a possible 1000), praising the graphics and gameplay, but noting that it may not appeal to hard-core RPG enthusiasts.Upchurch, David (March 1991). Obitus (review of Amiga version). ACE, p. 52. Electronic Gaming Monthly asserted the reverse in their review of the Super NES version, that the game would appeal to RPG enthusiasts but not those who dislike RPGs. They gave it a 6.4 out of 10, summarizing it as \\"a slow-moving RPG that will appeal more to patient gamers.\\" German gaming magazine Amiga Joker gave the Amiga version of Obitus an overall score of 73%, complimenting the 3D graphics and comparing the environment to 1984 ASCII game Beast but \\"complete with trigger happy enemies and delicate parallax scrolling.\\" In regards to gameplay, Amiga Joker stated \\"if Obitus were just an action game, the combat sequences would be a bit sparse, but as a change of pace from the puzzles they are very OK ... all in all Obitus isn't the peak of originality, but for an adventure-like game, because of the simple controls, it is a very good experience.\\" GamePro gave the Super NES version of Obitus four out of five stars, praising its music, controls and UI, and the blending of a classic RPG with side-scrolling action gameplay, stating they \\"work well together. ... The real-time fighting action is a good adrenaline break in your travels. On its own, though, it's nothing special.\\" Despite this, GamePro goes on to describe Obitus as \\"unambitious\\", and criticizes some instances of the game's animation as \\"stiff\\", and sound effects as \\"repetitive\\".

It is believed that patterns of neural firing, measured in Hz, correspond with states of alertness such as focused attention, deep sleep, etc. It is hypothesized that by listening to these beats of certain frequencies one can induce a desired state of consciousness that corresponds with specific neural activity, such as studying, sleeping, exercising, meditating, doing creative work, and so on. Neural oscillation and electroencephalography (EEG) Neural oscillations are rhythmic or repetitive electrochemical activity in the brain and central nervous system. Such oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. Neural tissue can generate oscillatory activity driven by mechanisms within individual neurons, as well as by interactions between them. They may also adjust frequency to synchronize with the periodic vibration of external acoustic or visual stimuli.Niedermeyer E. and da Silva F.L., Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2004. The activity of neurons generate electric currents; and the synchronous action of neural ensembles in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of neurons, produce macroscopic oscillations. These phenomena can be monitored and graphically documented by an electroencephalogram (EEG). The electroencephalographic representations of those oscillations are typically denoted by the term 'brainwaves' in common parlance. The technique of recording neural electrical activity within the brain from electrochemical readings taken from the scalp originated with the experiments of Richard Caton in 1875, whose findings were developed into electroencephalography (EEG) by Hans Berger in the late 1920s. Neural oscillation and cognitive functions The functional role of neural oscillations is still not fully understood; however they have been shown to correlate with emotional responses, motor control, and a number of cognitive functions including information transfer, perception, and memory. Specifically, neural oscillations, in particular theta activity, are extensively linked to memory function, and coupling between theta and gamma activity is considered to be vital for memory functions, including episodic memory. Entrainment =Meaning and origin of the term 'entrainment'= Entrainment is a term originally derived from complex systems theory, and denotes the way that two or more independent, autonomous oscillators with differing rhythms or frequencies, when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on coupling force, such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency. Examples include the mechanical entrainment or cyclic synchronization of two electric clothes dryers placed in close proximity, and the biological entrainment evident in the synchronized illumination of fireflies. Entrainment is a concept first identified by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens in 1665 who discovered the phenomenon during an experiment with pendulum clocks: He set them each in motion and found that when he returned the next day, the sway of their pendulums had all synchronized. Such entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce negative feedback. As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero, with systems of greater frequency slowing down, and the other speeding up.Bennett, M., Schatz, M. F., Rockwood, H., and Wiesenfeld, K., Huygens's clocks. Proceedings: Mathematics, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 2002, pp563-579. Subsequently, the term 'entrainment' has been used to describe a shared tendency of many physical and biological systems to synchronize their periodicity and rhythm through interaction. This tendency has been identified as specifically pertinent to the study of sound and music generally, and acoustic rhythms specifically. The most ubiquitous and familiar examples of neuromotor entrainment to acoustic stimuli is observable in spontaneous foot or finger tapping to the rhythmic beat of a song. =Brainwave entrainment= Brainwaves, or neural oscillations, share the fundamental constituents with acoustic and optical waves, including frequency, amplitude and periodicity. Consequently, Huygens' discovery precipitated inquiry into whether or not the synchronous electrical activity of cortical neural ensembles might not only alter in response to external acoustic or optical stimuli but also entrain or synchronize their frequency to that of a specific stimulus.Will, U., and Berg, E., \\"Brainwave synchronization and entrainment to periodic stimuli\\" Neuroscience Letters, Vol. 424, 2007, pp 55‚Äì60.Cade, G.

Brainwave entrainment is a colloquialism for 'neural entrainment', which is a term used to denote the way in which the aggregate frequency of oscillations produced by the synchronous electrical activity in ensembles of cortical neurons can adjust to synchronize with the periodic vibration of an external stimuli, such as a sustained acoustic frequency perceived as pitch, a regularly repeating pattern of intermittent sounds, perceived as rhythm, or of a regularly rhythmically intermittent flashing light.

Some sources mistakenly refer to him as James Kingston Tuckey. Tuckey was born at Greenhill, near Mallow, August 1776. He went to sea at an early age, and in 1793 was received into the navy. From the first he saw a good deal of active service, and he was more than once wounded. He was engaged in expeditions to the Red Sea, and in 1802 he helped expand the British colony of New South Wales in Australia as first-lieutenant of the . Amongst other services, he made a survey of Port Phillip District. On his return to England he published an Account of the Voyage to establish a Colony at Port Phillip. The Calcutta was captured by the French on a voyage from St. Helena in 1805, and Lieutenant Tuckey suffered an imprisonment of nearly nine years in France, during which time he married Miss Margaret Stuart, a fellow prisoner, and prepared a work on Maritime Geography and Statistics, published after his release. In 1814 he was promoted to the rank of commander, and in February 1816 he sailed to explore the River Congo in the schooner , accompanied by the stores ship Dorothy. The expedition aimed to find if there was a connection between the Congo and Niger basins of western and central Africa. Tuckey sailed up the river from its mouth but found that the lower river is not navigable due to rapids (later called the Yellala Falls) above Matadi. He only found ruins of the Portuguese colony and moribund Catholic missions. He suggested sending Protestant missionaries to the Congo. He explored the river up to Isangila. Most of the officers and crew died of fever and Tuckey himself died on 14 October 1816, aged 40, in Moanda, on the coast of today's DR Congo. The expedition was a failure but raised interest in the exploration of Africa. Tuckey, James Kingston. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica library edition online. Tuckey was described as tall, and had been handsome, but long and arduous service broke down his constitution, and by thirty he was grey-haired and nearly bald. Further it is described that his countenance was pleasing and pensive; he was gentle and kind in his manners, cheerful in conversation, and indulgent to those under his command. Named after A species of flowering plants named Euphorbia tuckeyana is named for him, named by Philip Barker Webb in 1849; they are native to the Cape Verde Islands.

History  Bloodshot Records was founded in 1993 by Nan Warshaw, Rob Miller, and Eric Babcock. Warshaw and Miller met in 1992 when they bonded over a passion for country music and began to regularly deejay on Wednesday country nights at a Chicago bar called Crash Palace, now called Delilah's. Both Warshaw and Miller had played in bands, had deejayed at their local college radio stations, and had worked in different areas of the music business. Warshaw had booked tours for bands she was friends with and had worked as a publicist for the band Killbilly who released a record on Flying Fish Records, where co-founder Babcock worked. Active in what was then a burgeoning underground country-roots music scene in Chicago, Warshaw and Miller made a wishlist of unheralded bands and musicians they loved on a cocktail napkin while having drinks at a bar. = Compilations = That cocktail napkin list eventually became the label's first release, a 1994 compilation called For A Life of Sin: A Compilation of Insurgent Chicago Country that Warshaw, Miller and Babcock self-funded. The album, which documented the Chicago music scene Warshaw and Miller saw at the time, included artists such as The Bottle Rockets and Robbie Fulks as well as long- time local Chicago band, The Sundowners. Using the compilation format, Bloodshot organized record release shows in multiple cities with four or five bands on each night's line up, which allowed a wide press presence for the small label, where the bands could sell what turned out to be some of the bands' first records at the multi-band lineup shows. The record was self- distributed and sold on consignment, with enough success that the record was paid for and there was funds to do another compilation. A year later, in 1995, the label released their second compilation album Hell Bent: Insurgent Country Volume 2. The album included band from all over the country, and Bloodshot continued to put on events showcasing the bands involved with the making of the record. Although well received by critics, Bloodshot had very tight financial constraints, and worked under the model of not starting a new project until the prior project had paid for itself. Also challenging was establishing Bloodshot's brand, a mixture of country, punk, and folk that had no prior precedence. The name of the music genre was a point of contention, with some grouping the unique, hard-to-classify singer-songwriter music under the alternative country and some grouping it under the Americana label. In 1997, co-founder Babcock left Bloodshot, eventually relocating to Nashville where he founded Catamount Records. In 2014, Bloodshot released their 20th anniversary album, While No One Was Looking: Toasting 20 Years of Bloodshot Records. The album is a 2-CD set with 38 artists that include bands like Andrew Bird, Blitzen Trapper, Superchunk and Diarrhea Planet covering songs by some of Bloodshot's stable of artists (i.e., Ryan Adams, Old 97's, Cory Branan, Justin Townes Earle). Bloodshot spent the year celebrating their success at surviving during a period when most independent record labels were going out of business. = Post-Heartbreaker = While Bloodshot built its catalog of releases of both compilation and records by an ever enlarging roster of artists and bands, the cost of running a record label was very challenging, requiring both Warshaw and Miller to work supplemental jobs to keep afloat. The label was initially run out of Warshaw's basement. When Bloodshot released Ryan Adams' record Heartbreaker, the popularity of the record created a more stable financial base for the label, and allowed Warshaw and Miller to dedicate themselves full-time to running the label, move to a bigger office space in the northwest side of Chicago, and begin to have employees. Singer Kelly Hogan was the first paid employee, working as the label's publicist. The Chicago twang, country, and punk scene, often described as a sort of an anti-Nashville, continued to expand, often led by various projects involving The Mekons' Jon Langford. = Chicago community = Bloodshot has close ties to the Chicago community and particularly to the Hideout. Since 2002, Bloodshot has put on a free BBQ and music day-long showcase at both Austin, Texas' SXSW and New York City's CMJ music festivals. The annual SXSW BBQs have often been anchored by performances by The Waco Brothers  Artists  Some of the early artists who started out on Bloodshot went on to sign with larger major record labels, specifically Old 97's and Ryan Adams. Ryan Adams had one of the label's best selling albums with the 2000 release Heartbreaker, having sold almost 500,000 copies. Neko Case had a licensing deal with Bloodshot Records in the United States and Mint Records in Canada before she signed with ANTI-. Bloodshot includes a diverse roster of artists. The roster includes Andre Williams, who wrote \\"Shake a Tail Feather,\\" faced challenges, and then had a career renaissance making records at Bloodshot. Bloodshot includes bands and projects by many members of The Mekons, including Jon Langford, Sally Timms, and Rico Bell. * Al Scorch‚Ä° * Alejandro Escovedo * Andre Williams‚Ä° * Andrew Bird * Banditos‚Ä° * Barrence Whitfield and the Savages‚Ä° * Ben Kweller * Ben Weaver * The Blacks * Bobby Bare, Jr.‚Ä° * The Bottle Rockets‚Ä° * Charlie Pickett * Cordero * Cory Branan‚Ä° * Danbert Nobacon * The Deadstring Brothers‚Ä° * The Detroit Cobras‚Ä° * Devil in a Woodpile * Dex Romweber‚Ä° * Dollar Store * Eddie Spaghetti‚Ä° * Exene Cervenka * Firewater‚Ä° * Freakwater‚Ä° * Gore Gore Girls * Graham Parker‚Ä° * Grievous Angels * Ha Ha Tonka‚Ä° * I'm Not Jim * Jason Hawk Harris‚Ä° * J.C.

Brody was drafted #12 in the National Basketball Association (NBA) draft, but chose to pass up an NBA career, to instead play basketball in Israel. He played on national basketball teams of both the United States and Israel, and served in the armies of both countries. A New Jersey All-star basketball player in high school, Brody led his team to an undefeated state championship. In college, he was a high-scoring, slick- passing All-American and All-Big Ten point guard in 1965, while playing for the University of Illinois. That year, he was drafted 12th in the NBA draft. Before the NBA season started, he traveled to Israel, where he led the American team to a gold medal in the 1965 Maccabiah Games. Convinced by Moshe Dayan and others, to return to Israel to help elevate the country's basketball team and morale, he passed up his NBA career, to instead play basketball for Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 1977, he led Maccabi Tel Aviv to the FIBA European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague) championship. Along the way, his team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Red Army team, CSKA Moscow. Brody's famous remark upon beating the Soviets ‚Äì \\"We are on the map! And we are staying on the map ‚Äì not only in sports, but in everything.\\" ‚Äì became a part of Israeli culture. It has been used for decades, in various contexts, from political speeches, to National Lottery commercials. Early life Brody is Jewish, and the son of Max and Shirley Brody. His father and paternal grandfather had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States, spending years in Israel, along the way. His father spent three years in Israel, in the 1920s, working as an engineer on the construction of the Rothenberg electric station, the country's first. Both his father and his grandfather, who lived in Israel for 10 years, helped build the country's first airfield, in Herzliya. Brody has an older sister, Renee. He was born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. Brody started playing basketball at age 8, in the Biddy Basketball League of the Trenton Jewish Community Center (JCC), in the Police Athletic League (PAL), and in the local Boys Club League. He then attended Trenton Central High School. There, he was a New Jersey high school basketball All Star, selected to the First Team All-State Team, by The Star-Ledger in his senior year, and led his undefeated 24‚Äì0 team to a state championship. He graduated in 1961. Asked by his yearbook what he wanted to be in his life, he said that he would like to become either a professional basketball player, or an FBI agent. College career Over 40 colleges approached Brody with scholarship offers. The Temple University Owls head coach Harry Litwak, in recruiting him, tried to dissuade him from going to powerhouse University of Illinois, suggesting that at the large school he would be \\"a small fish in a big pond\\". Conceding that the university was in fact a big one, Brody nevertheless told the coach that he liked the challenge of trying to be \\"a big fish\\" in a big pond. Brody attended the University of Illinois. On the social side, he joined Zeta Beta Tau, the campus Jewish fraternity. The basketball-focused Brody would sleep with his basketball, and dribble it to class. At the time, freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity basketball team, but as a sophomore he replaced the just-graduated Jerry Colangelo. Brody was an outstanding 1.87 m (6'1 \\") tall basketball star for the Illini, playing point guard while wearing uniform # 12. He was quick, slick, smart, and an excellent shooter and passer. His team won the Big Ten Championship, and was rated the number three team in the nation. He was voted a 1965 All-American, along with fellow college basketball players like Rick Barry, Bill Bradley, and Billy Cunningham. He was also named first team All-Big Ten, a second team academic All American, and a Converse top-10 player. The Sporting News picked him as one of the top 10 players in the nation, along with Bradley, Barry, Cunningham, and Jerry Sloan. In 1965, he graduated from Illinois with a bachelor's degree in physical education. As of 2008, Brody was still ranked 33rd among the all-time scorers in Illinois history. NBA draft and Maccabiah Games (1965) Brody was picked 12th in the 1965 National Basketball Association Draft by the Baltimore Bullets, known today as the Washington Wizards. That June he trained in a one-week Bullets rookie camp, and the team deemed him one of the best players. After the camp, the Bullets provided him with an apartment in Baltimore. He traveled to Israel for the first time in August, with the Bullets' permission and his parents' blessing. There, he played for the USA team in the 1965 Maccabiah Games, the international Jewish Olympics. He led the team to a gold medal. Moshe Dayan Immediately after the Maccabiah Games, he was approached by managers of the Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball team. They asked him to join the team, in order to help elevate Israeli basketball to a higher level. Others joined in asking Brody to stay in Israel after the tournament, including the iconic eye- patch-wearing Israeli general Moshe Dayan, the Israeli Minister of Sports, and Ministry of Education officials. At that point, the Israeli team had never survived past the first round in the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) competition. Israel, as Brody put it, had opened his eyes. He had never previously traveled anywhere outside the U.S. Before he arrived in Israel, all he knew about it was what he had studied in Hebrew school. To his surprise, rather than arriving in Biblical Israel (with people riding camels and living in tents), he found himself in a modern society in which for the first time he met Jews from around the globe. The experience was a culture shock, and he was attracted to the culture and the everyday life. It changed the NBA-bound basketball player's goals in life. Eventually, because he was Jewish he agreed to take up the challenge and stay. His decision completely changed Israeli basketball. Brody first returned to the United States, however, and completed his master's degree in educational psychology at Illinois. In August 1966, the NBA's St. Louis Hawks traded a veteran guard and a draft pick to the Bullets for the rights to Brody, but Brody chose to play basketball in Israel rather than in the NBA. Early Israeli basketball career (1966‚Äì69) Brody returned to Israel in 1966 to \\"take up that challenge\\", help an entire country rather than just one team, and take one year out of his life to play for Maccabi Tel Aviv. He felt he could do something \\"special\\". Ralph Klein, Israel's most successful coach at the time, said that up until the enthusiastic Brody's arrival, Israelis had only viewed basketball as a fun game. But within a year, with his serious attitude and his inspirational commitment, Brody had inculcated his teammates with his view of basketball as a way of life. At his urging, the team doubled the number of practices it held every week. To capitalize on Brody's quickness and speed, his coach abandoned the team's formerly slow pace in favor of a fast-paced motion game, built around fast breaks. Brody was the most dominant player in Europe's second-tier competition, the FIBA European Cup Winners Cup (FIBA Saporta Cup), in the 1966‚Äì67 season. In 1967, he was named Israel's Sportsman of the Year. The team made it through the first, second, and third rounds of the league playoffs, and reached the FIBA European Cup Winners Cup Finals, finishing second in the league. For the first time, the Israeli Prime Minister (Levi Eshkol), the Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff, and Knesset members came to games. Demand for tickets to games in the team's 5,000-seat stadium was so high that they became exceedingly difficult to obtain. In his down time, Brody coached Israeli soldiers when they were off duty from guarding Israel's border against its Arab neighbors. The experience, and the excitement Brody generated, made a deep impression on him. He had a vision of what he could accomplish, and saw the positive impact on the Israeli people's morale whenever Maccabi Tel Aviv beat a team in Europe. As he put it: \\"I felt it was bigger than me, and had to be continued, because I saw what the results were.\\" He had initially intended to help Israeli basketball for only one year. But that one year, and the excitement it generated (while at the same time, in the days preceding the June 1967 Six-Day War, Egypt and Syria were threatening to push the Israelis into the sea), pulled Brody into a second year. As the war was about to break out, the U.S. State Department sent him a telegram advising him to leave Israel. Instead of heeding the advice, he volunteered his services to lead Israeli soldiers at the Jordanian border in athletic exercises, as he stayed in Israel through the war. U.S. military service (1968‚Äì70) Brody returned to the U.S. in 1968, to fulfill his military duty during the Vietnam War. He first took \\"Advanced Infantry Preparation for Vietnam\\". He then played for two years for the U.S. Army and United States Armed Forces All Star Teams as a starting guard, while Israelis worried over the impact of his departure. He also played for the USA Men's National Basketball Team, which finished fifth at the 1970 FIBA World Championship in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in May 1970.1970 USA Basketball During that championship competition, he received a letter from Moshe Dayan, who asked him to return to Israel. Israel military service (1970‚Äì73) After the United States military released him, Brody returned to Israel to live. He made aliyah and became an Israeli citizen towards the end of 1970. The Israeli government called him up to its military that year, and he served in the Israeli Army. Later, as a reserve in the Israel Defense Forces, he was tasked with supporting the Israeli Air Force, in which his son Ron later served. Later Israeli basketball career (1973‚Äì80) At the 27-country 1973 Maccabiah Games, dedicated to the 11 Israeli athletes killed in the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Olympics, he was captain of the Israeli basketball team and given the honor of lighting the opening torch. He led the national team to a gold medal, as they beat a U.S. team led by Ernie Grunfeld in the finals. Brody played for Maccabi Tel Aviv until 1980. He won ten Israeli League championships with the team, and six Israel State Cups, in what has been described as a \\"stellar\\" and \\"amazing\\" career. With Maccabi Tel Aviv, he appeared in 81 FIBA European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague) games, scoring 1,378 points. Brody was also selected to the FIBA European Selection (European All-Star Team). In the Israeli Super League, Brody scored 4,049 points,All-Time Player Points.Tal Brody, Israeli basketball history. in 211 games.Ligat Ha'Al - Israel - Puntos. Brody also played for the senior Israeli National Team, scoring 1,219 points in 78 games. With that, he played on national basketball teams of both the U.S. and Israel, and served in the armies of both countries. When the Israeli Omri Casspi, was drafted in the first round of the 2009 NBA draft, by the Sacramento Kings, to play in the U.S., Brody called it \\"the completion of a circle\\". =The FIBA European Champions Cup Championship; \\"We are on the map!\\"= Brody drives to the hoop for a layup during a game The highlight of his career came in 1977. It was the apex of the Cold War, and the Soviet Union was boycotting Israel. In the first round of the European-wide top-tier level FIBA European Champions Cup (later renamed to EuroLeague), Maccabi Tel Aviv defeated Real Madrid, of Spain's top league, 94‚Äì85. In the second round, it beat Zbrojovka Brno, of Czechoslovakia's top-tier league, for the first time, 91‚Äì76, on February 15, 1977. In the FIBA European Champions Cup 1976‚Äì77 season semifinals, Maccabi Tel Aviv was matched against CSKA Moscow‚Äîthe Red Army team. CSKA Moscow was a powerhouse. The Soviet Army team had won the prior USSR Premier League basketball title. Six of its players had played on the Soviet national team that had defeated the United States in the 1972 Summer Olympics, and their captain was Sergei Belov (who years later recalled that Brody was one of his toughest opponents). And the Communists were well known for using sports to glorify what they billed as their supremacy over the West. The Soviet Union had broken off diplomatic relations with Israel a decade earlier, and politically and militarily backed Israel's Arab enemies. For political reasons, therefore, CSKA Moscow refused to play in Tel Aviv (which would have resulted in a technical defeat). And the Soviets also refused to grant visas to the Israelis, to allow them to come play in Moscow. In the end, Maccabi Tel Aviv's \\"home game\\" was played in the small, neutral town of Virton, Belgium. The game took place in an emotional and politically charged atmosphere. It was of huge symbolic value for Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, and for many Israelis who ordinarily had no interest in basketball. The game pitted the capitalist West against the Communist East, and Israel against the country that was supplying its enemies with weapons. The game also matched the country of Israel, with a total of a mere 4 million inhabitants, against the Soviets, with their 290 million people. The newspaper Maariv billed the February 17, 1977, game as \\"the fight between David and Goliath.\\" Most of Israel's population watched the game, which was broadcast on Israel's only TV channel at the time. Maccabi Tel Aviv upset the heavily favored Soviets, 91‚Äì79. Enthusiastic fans carried Brody off the court on their shoulders. The feeling among Israelis was not only that CSKA Moscow had been defeated, but that a victory ‚Äì albeit small ‚Äì had been achieved against the mighty Soviet Union. The game has for decades been recognized as a key event in the forging of Israel's national identity. Even decades later, it was being replayed repeatedly on Israeli television. \\"We are on the map!\\" proclaimed an elated, euphoric Brody in his heavily American- accented Hebrew, as a TV announcer pushed a microphone in front of him for a post-game quote, while people danced the hora around him in excitement and celebration. \\"And we are staying on the map ‚Äì not only in sports, but in everything.\\"In Hebrew: \\"◊ê◊†◊ó◊†◊ï ◊ë◊û◊§◊î! ◊ï◊ê◊†◊ó◊†◊ï ◊†◊©◊ê◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊û◊§◊î ‚Äì ◊ú◊ê ◊®◊ß ◊ë◊°◊§◊ï◊®◊ò, ◊ë◊î◊õ◊ú\\" The remark was spontaneous, and unprepared. As Brody put it, it just \\"came out of my heart, at that instant.\\" Then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called Brody into his office, and told him that Brody's statement had brought tears to his eyes, and had immeasurably impacted the Israeli people's morale. The phrase \\"We are on the map!\\" (\\"anachnu al hamapa, ve'anahnu nisharim al hamapa!\\"), a literal translation of an English phrase into his adopted language, but a novel saying in Hebrew, became a new, popular phrase in Israel. It reflected a physical victory by the nascent Jewish Zionist idea, and national pride. It became Israel's most famous quote. The phrase was as significant for Israelis as U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong's statement ‚Äì \\"One small step for man; one giant step for mankind\\" ‚Äì had been for Americans, vis-a-vis the space age. The saying became a staple of Israeli speech. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin co-opted the phrase as an election campaign slogan in 1981. It was also used by former Soviet refusenik and Israeli Yisrael BaAliyah party leader and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, in 1998. The Israeli National Lottery Board spoofed it in a television commercial, in which a winning racehorse with an American accent stated: \\"We are on the racetrack, and we will stay on the racetrack.\\" Similarly, when Israel's Davis Cup team beat the powerhouse Russian Davis Cup team in a shocking victory in the 2009 Davis Cup tennis quarter-finals, Prime Minister Netanyahu telephoned the Israel Tennis Association Director General and echoed Brody's statement of over three decades earlier, saying: \\"We're back on the map\\". Back home, hundreds of thousands of Israelis celebrated spontaneously in the streets, and 150,000 in Tel Aviv congregated in celebration in what is now Rabin Square. Many jumped into its fountain, splashing in water and champagne. Recalling the moment, an Israeli quoted in the book From Beirut to Jerusalem told Thomas Friedman that on one level it was Brody the star basketball player and his teammates beating the Russians, but on another level it was \\"my grandfather beating them. It was our retroactive victory over the Cossacks.\\" Brody was credited with being so inspiring that basketball became Israel's number one sport, surpassing soccer. The FIBA European Champions Cup finals were played in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on April 7, 1977. Yugoslavia was a Communist country, with which Israel did not have diplomatic relations, and the El Al plane that brought the Maccabi Tel Aviv players over to it for the game was the first Israeli plane ever allowed to land there. The Israelis were pitted against the highly favored Mobilgirgi Varese, the champions of Italy's top league. Mobilgirgi Varese had beaten the Israelis twice that year, and had beaten them in the European-wide second-tier level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup finals ten years earlier, when Brody first started playing for Maccabi Tel Aviv. Back in Israel, the entire country watched the game on television. Maccabi Tel Aviv went on to defeat Mobilgirgi Varese by one point, 78‚Äì77, in the FIBA European Champions Cup Finals. Brody, as the team captain, received the European Cup trophy from FIBA's Secretary General, and lifted it over his head. It was Israel's first FIBA European Champions Cup basketball championship in the 23-nation league. It was also the first time that Israel had won a championship of that caliber in any sport, and was, at the time, Israel's greatest achievement in international sports. The victory greatly lifted the spirit and morale of the country. In Israel, 200,000 people gathered to celebrate in Israel's National Park, and the event was celebrated as a national holiday. When the team returned home, it found 150,000 Israelis waiting for it. Brody himself became widely known as an Israeli national hero, and as a symbol of Israel's achievements. In 1978, the team was also a semi-finalist in the 1977‚Äì78 FIBA European Champions Cup basketball competition. When Brody retired from basketball in 1980, a special official retirement game was arranged in his honor, and the FIBA European Selection All-Star Team arrived in Israel, to play against Maccabi Tel Aviv. =Pro basketball career accomplishments= *FIBA Saporta Cup Finals Top Scorer: (1967) *Israeli Sportsman of the Year: (1967) *10√ó Israeli League Champion: (1967, 1968, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980) *6√ó Israeli State Cup Winner: (1973, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980) *EuroLeague champion: (1977) *FIBA European Selection: (1978) *Israel Prize: (1979) =Professional career scoring statistics= { bgcolor=\\"#f7f8ff\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  align=\\"center\\"Competition  align=\\"center\\"Games Played  align=\\"center\\"Points Scored  align=\\"center\\"Scoring Average  align=\\"center\\"Ref. - bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" align=left Israeli League 211 4,049 19.2  - bgcolor=\\"#EFEFEF\\" align=\\"left\\" EuroLeague 81 1,378 17.0  -align=left FIBA International Competitions (Israeli National Team) 78 1,219 15.6  } Honors Brody became the first sportsman to be awarded the Israel Prize, Israel's highest civilian honor, in 1979. It was presented to him by Israeli President Yitzhak Navon, in recognition of his unique contribution to Israeli society and the State in the field of sports. The Israel Prize Committee noted that he was \\"an excellent athlete who set an outstanding example\\" for Israeli immigrants and absorption. During his basketball career, he was also twice named Israeli Basketball Player of the Year. Brody was given the honor of lighting the torch at the opening of the 1981 Maccabiah Games at Ramat Gan Stadium, in front of 45,000 fans and sportsmen from 54 countries. In 1988 he was voted the Israeli athlete who most influenced Israeli sports, in a poll by the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv. In 1996, he was elected the University of Illinois \\"Man of the Year\\", in recognition of his sports and other accomplishments, and awarded the school's \\"I\\" Award for his achievements. In 2004, he was given the honor of lighting a torch at the 56th Israeli Independence Day ceremony on Mount Herzl. He and Maccabi Tel Aviv were the first non-U.S. basketball team to be honored at the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, in a special exhibition in 2008. In Israel, Brody is widely recognized as a revered national hero, icon, and legend. He is a superstar, on a level similar to that of Michael Jordan in the United States. Some people view him as the greatest and most famous athlete to have ever represented Israel. As Israel's first modern-day sports hero, he is a symbol of all the young country's achievements, and not only its successes in basketball. He is known by the nicknames: \\"Mr. Basketball\\", and \\"The man who put Israel on the Map\\". =Halls of Fame= In 1996, Brody was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and in March 2011 he was inducted into the U.S. National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Israeli Basketball Hall of Fame. He represented Maccabi Tel Aviv as it became the first non-U.S. basketball team to be honored at the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, in a special exhibition in 2008 entitled \\"Putting Israel on the Map\\". Life after playing basketball =Basketball- related= After he retired as a player, Brody continued with Maccabi Tel Aviv as an assistant coach. He was on the team's Board of Directors until 2007, when Netanyahu approached him with regard to entering politics. In addition, he has been Maccabi Tel Aviv's volunteer liaison with the National Basketball Association since 1988, helping organize games between Maccabi Tel Aviv and various NBA teams. Brody was also a sports commentator for Israeli television in the early 1990s. He in addition became an instructor at the Wingate Institute of Physical Fitness in Netanya. Brody serves as well on the Board of Directors of the Maccabi World Union (MWU), which organizes the Maccabiah Games in Israel. He was also appointed to serve on a panel of experts who select recipients of the Israel Prize for athletics. Brody was featured in a 2008 documentary entitled The Jewish Basketball Hall of Fame, Volume 1, produced by Yisrael Lifschutz. He was also featured in a book by the title: A Voice Called; Stories of Jewish Heroism, by Yossi Katz, which was published in 2010. =Business career= After retiring from playing basketball, Brody established, and was Chief Executive Officer and a co-owner of, a sporting goods export/import/distribution business named Sports United Ltd. At the same time, he ran basketball clinics across Israel. He ultimately sold the sporting goods business to his partner. Brody also was appointed the local agent of Japanese consumer goods company Mitsuboshi C.I. Co., and was elected to the Japan-Israel Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. He then entered the insurance business. Brody established, owned, and managed an independent insurance firm named Tal Brody Insurance Agency in Tel Aviv. The company handled pension programs, provident funds, and health and education funds for 20 years. He ultimately sold the business in 2008. He has since retired from the business world, which he calls the second stage of his life. =Philanthropy= Since retiring from basketball, Brody has initiated, volunteered for, and assisted a number of charitable organizations and efforts. He created an after-school program for Israeli children, called \\"Let's Play Ball!\\" As part of the program, he coaches basketball and gives basketball clinics to schoolchildren, members of kibbutzim, residents of development towns, and soldiers in the Israeli army. The program has impacted over 200,000 children. He is also Chairman of the Spirit of Israel (JAFI), a non-profit Jewish Agency subsidiary that he created in 1999. It raises money from the Israeli public to help underprivileged Israeli children and others, by providing for their \\"vital human needs\\" (as defined by the Jewish Agency and Keren Hayesod). He arrived at the idea for the charity when he attended a meeting at which efforts to raise money in the U.S. for Israel were being discussed. Brody began to muse about what Israelis were doing for themselves on the charity front. As a result, he established the Spirit of Israel to raise money within Israel for Israelis. Projects included assisting Israeli senior citizens, \\"at risk\\" children, and family abuse victims. Brody is also Sports Ambassador for Migdal Ohr and the America‚ÄìIsrael Friendship League (AIFL). Migdal Ohr helps at-risk, disadvantaged, impoverished, orphaned, and underprivileged Israeli children of all religions. He helped organize and promote an exhibition game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the New York Knicks in the U.S., with all proceeds going to benefit Migdal Ohr. In 1985, Brody joined with Herzliya and its Mayor (Eli Landau) to construct and run one of the world's largest basketball schools, designing a unique program with specially chosen coaches. The school is Bnei Herzliya. The basketball school is now run by the municipality of Herzliya, with Brody serving as its president. It provides a basketball program to 14,000 children from ages 5‚Äì18, drawn from 14 citywide schools. Brody also has spoken around the world for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and for American Jewish organizations. =Political career (2008)= Brody was asked to join Yitzhak Yitzhaky's One Israel party in 1980, after he retired. But he rejected the offer. He did not view himself as a politician, and was not seeking a political career. Though he joined the Likud party in the 1990s, he was not openly active in politics because he didn't believe that an active sportsman should involve himself in politics. When Likud party chairman Benjamin Netanyahu approached him personally, however, and asked him to step forward for the country, Brody for the first time considered entering politics. Netanyahu was interested in involving people who had not formerly entered into politics. Brody found it difficult to turn away Netanyahu, who impressed upon him that it would be important to Israel for Brody to run for office. Netanyahu suggested that Brody could more effectively push the advances he was already seeking, in education, sports, immigration, absorption, and social issues, if he were a member of the Israeli Knesset. Brody announced in August 2007 that he was seriously considering running for the Knesset in the general election, as a Likud candidate. He said in November 2008 that he felt that it was the appropriate point in his life to change careers, after having spent much of his life first playing basketball and then heading an insurance agency that managed employment benefits programs for companies. He noted that the Knesset would be a third career calling for him, as long as it allowed him to concentrate on those areas that were already his focus, such as sports, education, aliyah, the Diaspora, Israeli-American relations, and helping children who are \\"at risk\\", and that he saw it as a good way to spend the third phase of his life after basketball and business. He stressed that in his view it wasn't politics, but rather \\"good citizenship\\". But he acknowledged that when he discussed his goals with Netanyahu, the Prime Minister had replied that \\"in the Knesset, they call it politics.\\" Brody ran for a national slot (places 2‚Äì19 on Likud's list), to represent the district between Tel Aviv and Haifa, along the Israeli coast. He became the fourth candidate who was formerly a resident of the U.S., and was supported by Likud Anglos, Likud's English-speaking division. In a November 2008 press conference Brody and Netanyahu held, Brody said: \\"We need to change the situation in the country. 70% of the people think there is corruption in politics.\\" Netanyahu introduced Brody as his future Minister of Sports and Culture. Among other things, Brody noted that Israel's amateur sports budget had declined from $35 million a year to $10 million a year, and suggested that the budget could be supplemented by working with the NBA or the National Football League. He also had in mind the creation of a sports program with Birthright Israel Taglit to encourage aliyah. Endorsed by Netanyahu, he said that whether he won or lost, at least he would feel that he did all he could to answer Netanyahu's request that candidates with varied abilities and life experiences run for the Knesset. He joked, however, that if he were to win, he looked forward to playing basketball against President Obama, who is an intense basketball fan. In the December 2008 Likud primaries, however, he was not elected to Likud's list of candidates. Danny Danon, the well-organized chairman of World Likud‚Äîwho was backed by Zo Artzeinu co-founder Moshe Feiglin‚Äîbeat him in what turned out to be an intense fight for the slot on the Likud list. Remarking on his feelings about the primaries, Brody said that he had only become involved in the political process because he thought it was the obligation of people to come forward to serve the country, but that his involvement in the process had made him aware of the fact that many local voters rely on the \\"professional politicians\\" for jobs. =Goodwill Ambassador (2010‚Äìpresent)= Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Brody in early 2009 to help Israel in a yet-to-be-created official position of goodwill ambassador for the country. In July 2010, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman appointed Brody as the first international Goodwill Ambassador for Israel, to assist with Israel's international diplomacy. In that unpaid position‚Äîthe only money he receives is compensation for his expenses‚Äîhe speaks to audiences outside of Israel about Israel's culture, sports, and successes, and Israelis' daily lives. His trips outside Israel are coordinated by the Israeli Foreign Ministry and by Israel's embassies and consulates. He speaks at schools, universities, Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and community centers, synagogues, Christian events, African- American organizations, and fundraising events. While he seeks to encourage those people who support Israel, a major focus of his‚Äîwhich accords with a suggestion he was given by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz‚Äîis on those people who are undecided about Israel. His discussions with groups outside of Israel have touched on the tension between terrorism and restrictions on freedom of movement, Israel's security fence, Israel's Black Ethiopian Jews, and the role of Israeli Arabs in Israeli society. Brody said that he took on the role because it was what he wanted to do‚Äîserve the State of Israel. In May 2015, Brody was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his outstanding contribution to shaping and helping Israel through sports and dedicated hasbara (public diplomacy) efforts at a Nefesh B'Nefesh Bonei Zion 2015 Prizes special ceremony at the Knesset hosted by Knesset Member Tzachi Hanegbi. Personal life Tal Brody with his wife Tirtza in 2015 After Brody returned to Israel in 1970, he married a 20-year-old Israeli woman, Ronit Born, in a wedding that Defense Minister Moshe Dayan attended as his guest of honor. The two were married for 14 years. Brody and his second wife Tirtza, whom he married in the early 1980s, live in Netanya in Israel. He has three children (two from his first marriage (Ron and Kareen), and a daughter Linor from his second wife's first marriage), and five grandchildren. His American- accented Hebrew is the result of his not having formally studied the language when he arrived in Israel‚Äîas he thought his stay would be a temporary one, rather than a decades-long one. He instead picked up the language from colloquial use. His Hebrew consequently remains a source of amusement in Israel, and has been humorously targeted by friends and family, as well as by Eretz Nehederet, Israel's version of Saturday Night Live.

Species in North Africa emerge in January to begin mating, synchronously with floral bloom. Normally Pimelia are detrivores, but during mating season they may cannibalize other adults, larvae, and eggs. This behavior may be due to need for extra nutrients or simply to eliminate competitors. Following behaviorRamussen, J.L., et al. (1991). The reproductive behavior of six species of Namib Desert tenebrionid beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Journal of Insect Behavior 4(5) 567-82. and mating take place on the slip face of a sand dune. After mating, the female digs a shallow hole and deposits a single egg, which closely resembles a grain of white rice. As the temperature rises above 50 ¬∞C the adult population dies off. Immature stages remain below the surface until maturity. During the winter the adults emerge.Lillig, M. and T. Pavlicek. Die schwarzkafer des Sinai (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Moscow, Russia. Pensoft. 2002. Desert adaptations Many Pimelia species are conspicuous as they cross sand dunes. Locomotion in this difficult terrain is facilitated by numerous tarsal setae that allow for rapid tumbling behavior.Rech, N. D. (1997). Comparison of the tumbling movement found in two species of Adesmia Fischer-Waldheim (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Coleopterists Bulletin 51(1) 86-92. Adaptations to arid climates and desert environments allow Pimelia to survive and reproduce in the dunes, but the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors in this respect is not clear.Ayal, Y. and O. Merkl. (1993). Spatial and temporal distribution of tenebrionid species (Coleoptera) in the Negev Highlands, Israel. Journal of Arid Environments 27 347-61. Environmental factors influencing these adaptations are extremes of temperature and humidity, excessive radiant energy, low and irregular rainfall, long periods of drought, strong winds, unstable sand substrates, and sparse, specialized vegetation.Cloudsley-Thompson, J. L. (1979). Adaptive functions of the colours of desert animals. Journal of Arid Environments 2 95-104. Several morphological adaptations allow Pimelia to survive in the desert, including the lipid layers of the epicuticle, fused sclerites, the subelytral cavity, and the texture of the body surface. Much of the success of tenebrionid beetles in desert habitats is due to the development of impermeable cuticles.Adhearn, G.A. (1970). The control of water loss in desert tenebrionid beetles. Journal of Experimental Biology 53 573-95. The fused sclerites of desert tenebrionids minimize water loss,Cloudsley-Thompson, J. L. (1968). Respiratory function and thermal acclimation in tropical invertebrates. Nature 218 685. but they result in flightlessness.Buxton, P. A. (1923). Heat, moisture, and animal's life in deserts. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London 96 123-31. The main barrier to the outward flow of water through insect integument is the lipid layer of the epicuticle.Cloudsley-Thompson, J. L. (1956). Studies in diurnal rhythms; bioclimatic observation in Tunisia and their significance in relation to the physiology of the fauna, especially woodlice, centipedes, scorpions and beetles. Annals and Magazine of Natural History 12(9) 305-29. In many terrestrial arthropods, the temperature affects the permeability of the cuticle. There is a sudden increase in the rate of transpiration at what is known as the transition temperature. This may coincide with a physical change, perhaps the disorientation of the lipid molecules in the epicuticle.Hadley, N. F. (1972). Desert species and adaptation. American Scientist 60 338-47. In tenebrionid beetles, the spiracles open into a humid subelytral cavity rather than directly to the atmosphere, thus reducing water loss. Water retention by intact elytral covers is greater at 0% relative humidity than at 97%. The size of the cavity is not important. Transpiration increases if the elytra are removed, emphasizing the importance of the epicuticle and subelytral cavity.Cloudsley-Thompson, J. L. (1964). On the function of the sub-elytral cavity in desert Tenebrionidae (Coleoptera). Entomologist's Monthly Magazine 100 148-51. Pimelia have tubercles on the surface of their elytra which scatter and reflect incident energy. Burrowing is probably the most important behavior modification for heat regulation in Pimelia, because it permits access to a broad range of ambient temperatures.Hamilton, W. J. Coloration and its Thermal Consequences for Diurnal Desert Insects. Stroudsburg, PA: Dowden, Hutchinson & Ross. 1975.

A series has been made from it and one of the filming scenes is Madonna's house. This book is a classic.  Synopsis  Robert Nobel is a 12-year-old shy boy who despairs of his newly divorced parents. Living in the dog-leg, he has to face many difficulties. He is the victim of classroom jokes and a victim of Niker, the classroom bully. He is hated and forced to do disgusting things. His life changes when a storyteller, Catherine, invites some of his class to Mayfield Rest Home. In there, he has to do a project with an elder: Edith Sorrel. Edith Sorrel asks him to go to Chance House, a lonely abandoned house standing out of nowhere. He goes into and tells this to the one he loves: Kate. However, Niker hears him and challenge him to spend a night together at the top. Having done this, Edith Sorrel gives him a new task: to create a coat of feathers just for her. He sews night and day to create it and finally, it is nearly ready. However, there is another problem: Niker. Niker destroys his coat of feathers and he has to sew it back! Finally, he gives it back to Edith and when she has it: she flies and then she dies. In the end, he meets his father once again and they happily go fishing together. About the author Nicker Singer was born in 1956 she started writing books but she also created a documentary. Nicky Singer saw a house which looked like Chance House: poorly decorated, abandoned and this gave her the idea to write the book. She was also inspired by Roland (her son). She also wrote the survival game (30 years in the future) and the island. Adaptations The book was adapted for television in 2004 and first shown as a series of six 30-minute episodes on BBC One from 16th March, then repeated as a single feature-length programme on 30th May. The series was written and produced by Peter Tabern and directed by Dermot Boyd, starring Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Sheila Hancock. Tabern and Boyd shared the award for Best Drama at the British Academy Children's Awards. In 2006 the National Theatre commissioned a musical version for young people to perform, for which Singer and Boyd wrote the script with lyrics by Don Black and music by Debbie Wiseman.

He took up journalism in his late twenties and was on the staff of The Manchester Guardian in 1907‚Äì1914. He later became a drama critic for The Saturday Review (1921‚Äì1923), The Sunday Times (1923‚Äì1947) and the BBC (1925‚Äì1932). The nine volumes of Agate's diaries and letters cover the British theatre of his time and non-theatrical interests such as sports, social gossip and private preoccupations with health and finances. He published three novels, translated a play briefly staged in London, and regularly published collections of theatre essays and reviews. Early years Agate, the eldest child of Charles James Agate (1832‚Äì1909), a wholesale linen draper, and Eulalie Julia n√©e Young, was born in Pendleton, near Manchester, England.Ivor Brown, rev. Marc Brodie \\"Agate, James Evershed (1877‚Äì1947)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 16 May 2010 (requires subscription). His father had a keen interest in, and connections to, music and the theatre. Gustave Garcia, nephew to the prima donna Maria Malibran, was Charles's lifelong friend since they were apprenticed together in the cotton warehouse. Agate's mother was educated in Paris and Heidelberg, and was an accomplished pianist.Herbert Van Thal, ed., James Agate, an Anthology; introduction by Alan Dent, New York, Hill and Wang, 1961. Through Agate's family connections to the active German artistic community in Manchester, he had much exposure to performance in his youth. In October 1912, Sarah Bernhardt visited the Agate home, an indication of the family's position in the local arts scene.James Harding, Agate: a Biography London: Methuen, 1986. Agate's only sister, May, later studied acting under Bernhardt in Paris. After education at Giggleswick School and Manchester Grammar School, where he was academically outstanding, he did not go to a university, but went into his father's business, where he worked for 17 years. In his spare time he was a regular theatre goer, and admired and longed to emulate the critical writing of George Bernard Shaw in The Saturday Review. In 1906 he wrote a letter about drama to a local Manchester paper. The editor printed Agate's contribution and invited him to write a weekly theatre column. After a year Agate joined the Manchester Guardian's team of critics under the guidance of C. E. Montague. Even as a junior critic Agate did not hesitate to give bad notices to the leading figures of the English stage when he thought it justified. Within months of taking up his post, he wrote of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's performance as Richard II, \\"It was extraordinarily uninteresting, and it is amazing how badly a tragic part can fit an actor so fine as, in other directions, Mr. Tree undoubtedly is.\\"J. E. A., \\"Theatre Royal\\", The Manchester Guardian, 6 November 1907, p. 12. Later, Agate was bested by Lilian Braithwaite, who responded to his assertion that she was \\"the second most beautiful woman in London\\" by replying, \\"I shall long cherish that, coming from our second-best theatre critic.\\"Nightingale, \\"For love and money\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 11 April 1986, p. 383. In his early twenties, Agate wrote a play, The After Years, which his biographer, Ivor Brown describes as \\"less than successfully realized\\". Another biographer, James Harding, said of Agate's subsequent attempts at fiction (a second play and three novels) that they are \\"of small import\\".Harding, p. 25, quoted in ODNB. Agate volunteered in May 1915 at the age of thirty-seven for the Army Service Corps, and was posted to France. He had an arrangement to supply a series of open letters about his wartime experiences to Allan Monkhouse at The Manchester Guardian. These were published in his first book, L. of C. (Lines of Communication), of which a reviewer wrote, \\"Captain James E. Agate ranks as one of the first hundred thousand soldiers who have written a book about the war, but... one is sure there will be no other book like this one.... It is our old friend 'J. E. A.' at his irritating best in khaki.\\"\\"A War Book\\", The Manchester Guardian, 20 June 1917, p. 3. Agate's fluency in French and knowledge of horses found him a successful job as a hay procurer, described in the first volume of his Ego. His system of accounting for wartime hay purchases in a foreign land was eventually recognised by the War Office and made into an official handbook. Captain Agate's name was engraved on the Chapel-en-le-Frith War Memorial in Derbyshire. After L of C, Agate published a book of essays on the theatre, Buzz, Buzz! (1918). In the same year, while still serving in France, Agate married Sidonie Jos√©phine Edm√©e Mourret- Castillon, daughter of a rich landowner. The marriage was short-lived, and after it broke up amicably, Agate's relationships were exclusively homosexual.The Manchester Guardian obituary, 7 June 1947, p. 8. London theatre critic On returning to civilian life, Agate pursued his career as a theatre critic. In 1919 he published a second book of essays, Alarums and Excursions.\\"Agate, James Evershed\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007. Accessed 16 May 2010 (requires subscription). In 1921 he secured the post with The Saturday Review once held by Shaw (and then by Max Beerbohm), and in 1923 he moved to The Sunday Times, where he remained theatre critic for the rest of his life. From 1925 to 1932 he combined his newspaper work with the post of drama critic for the British Broadcasting Corporation. His former paper, The Manchester Guardian, later wrote of him, \\"That Agate was the first dramatic critic of his time may well be doubted by adherents of Ivor Brown or Desmond MacCarthy, but beyond dispute he was the first theatrical critic. He was native to the theatre, he understood acting, he had in his blood both the French... and English stages.\\" In addition to his work on theatre, Agate was film critic to The Tatler and literary critic to The Daily Express, and also had leisure interests that occupied much time and money. He was a cricket and boxing enthusiast, the owner of Hackney show horses, and an avid golfer. All these are reflected in his diaries, published between 1935 and his death in a series of volumes entitled Ego, Ego 2, Ego 3, etc. (When he published Ego 8, his friend and sometime secretary Leo Pavia enquired, \\"Will the Ninth be choral?\\")Agate, p. 256. The historian Jacques Barzun, a fan of Agate and editor of a reissue of the last two volumes of Agate's Ego series,The Later Ego, Consisting of Ego 8 and Ego 9, Jacques Barzun, ed., New York, Crown Publishers, 1951 highlighted Agate in 2001,From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present, Jacques Barzun, Harper Perennial, 2001. which rekindled the interest of a new generation: > \\"When in 1932 he [Agate] decided to start a diary, he resolved to depict his > life entire, which meant giving a place not solely to his daily thoughts and > occupations but also to his talk and correspondence with others, including > his brothers and sister, no less singular than himself. The resulting > narrative, with fragments of hilarious mock-fiction, ranks with Pepys's > diary for vividness of characterization and fullness of historical detail\\". Alistair Cooke was another admirer of Agate, and devoted one of his \\"Letters from America\\" to the \\"Supreme Diarist.\\"\\"Letter from America\\", see also Letter from America. Agate had a series of secretaries, of whom Alan Dent, known as Jock, served for 14 years and became the most prominent. Dent arrived on Agate's doorstep in September 1926: \\"He announced that his name was Alan Dent, that he resided at some absurd place near Ayr, that he had received university education, hated medicine and refused to be a doctor, that he admired my work, intended to be my secretary willy-nilly, and had walked from Scotland for that purpose. I looked at his boots and knew the last statement to be merely ad captandum and with intent to mollify.\\" (From Ego [1], Page 91.) Agate's style in the diary entries that constitute the nine volumes of \\"Ego\\" is discursive. Anecdotes of the day's news, excerpts from his voluminous correspondence with readers of his reviews and books, frank and often amusing ruminations on his health (he was a hypochondriac and obsessive-compulsive) and poor financial state abound. Many of his diary entries mention his friends Herbert Van Thal, George Lyttelton, Dent and Pavia, and Edward Agate, his much-loved brother. He had recurring themes around Malibran, Sarah Bernhardt, R√©jane, Rachel, the Dreyfus Affair, Shakespeare, and Dickens. His style is \\"vigorous and outspoken, and always entertaining, in spite of his refusal to admit greatness in any actor later than Irving.\\"Phyllis Hartnoll and Peter Found, eds, \\"Agate, James Evershed\\", The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre, Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 May 2010 (requires subscription). He has been compared to critics of an earlier generation, Clement Scott and A B Walkley: \\"He admired the power Scott had enjoyed on the Daily Telegraph during the last third of the nineteenth century, and enjoyed Walkley's elitism and francophilia on The Times during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. Agate sought to position himself in that tradition, and his criticism consequently is verbose and self-indulgent but hugely entertaining and revealing.\\"Victor Emeljanow, \\"Agate, James\\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance, Oxford University Press, 2003, accessed 16 May 2010 (requires subscription). Agate made a short-lived, unsuccessful adaptation of a German play, I Accuse! from the original of Dr. Hans Rehfisch and Wilhelm Herzog; it opened and closed in London in October 1937.The Times, 28 October 1937, p. 14. The Times reviewer commented, \\"Mr. Agate is suspected of having been too faithful to a too earnest German original.\\"\\"Q Theatre: I Accuse\\", The Times, 26 October 1937, p. 12.\\"London Sees 'I Accuse'; Play Concerning Dreyfus Case Presented at Q Theatre\\", New York Times, 26 October 1937. His theatrical notices appeared in a series of collections. including Buzz, Buzz!, Playgoing, First Nights and More First Nights, and are valuable for their history of London theatre between the world wars. His anthology The English Dramatic Critics, 1660‚Äì1932 is important. He wrote a biography of the French actress Rachel, a heroine, which Arnold Bennett called \\"excited and exciting\\" and of its subject \\"beyond question the best life in English\\".Harding. Later life Agate's health declined during the Second World War and he began to suffer from heart trouble. He died suddenly at his home in Holborn, London, at the age of 69, shortly after completing his ninth Ego volume. Bibliography Agate's nine Ego volumes appeared in 1935, 1936, 1938, 1940, 1942, 1944, 1945 (and A Shorter Ego in two volumes, Harrap, 1946), 1947 and 1948.

Each guest at the function receives a mysterious note saying, \\"Consult your conscience. Your secret is common gossip.\\" Immediately, the guests are thrown into a panic as each has something to hide. The notes, however, were inspired by flapper Virginia Gardener, who had been left out of the party thrown by her mother (Ware), and passed out the notes as a joke to get revenge.Synopsis at New York Times Movie Database A man is shot during the excitement and Major Bruce Forbes (Gordon), who picked up the gun, is initially accused of murder. However, the real shooter soon confesses. Marion goes to the Adirondacks to see her brother, and finds happiness in the arms of Bruce, who fell in love with her at the ball.

Founded in 1927, it is the world's oldest and largest koala sanctuary in the world.  History  The name originates from a lone hoop pine that was planted by the Clarkson family, the first owners of the site. The sanctuary opened in 1927 to provide a safe refuge to sick, injured, and orphaned koalas, at a time when they were being killed for their fur. The founder of the sanctuary, Claude Reid, recognised the need to protect this iconic species and initiated the protection of their habitat. The sanctuary began with two koalas called Jack and Jill. Lone Pine became known internationally during World War II when Americans, including Douglas MacArthur's wife, visited the park to view the native Australian animals.  Wildlife  A bellowing male koala in the sanctuary. Wildlife in the sanctuary includes: koalas, kangaroos, Tasmanian devils, wombats, echidnas, and various species of reptiles, as well as a platypus that arrived at the sanctuary during 2010 from Healesville Sanctuary (near Melbourne). Visitors are allowed to hold koalas for a fee. Strict regulations ensure that each koala is not held for more than thirty minutes every day. Fees paid for souvenir photos help fund new enclosures, research projects and eucalyptus plantations. Visitors can feed and pet the free-roaming kangaroos in the kangaroo reserve, where more than 130 of the animals freely reside. There are also many colourful Australian parrots and cockatoos, as well as other Australian birds such as kookaburras, emus, and cassowaries. Rainbow lorikeets fly to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary for the specially prepared nectar meals at the sanctuary. Visitors can feed the lorikeets directly twice a day. Once a day there is a bird of prey show with several kinds of raptors showing off their speed agility and keen eyesight. The Tasmanian Devils are fed in the afternoon. 'Koala Forest' is a large koala enclosure with over 30 koalas surrounding the customers. Koalas there are fed mid-morning and mid-afternoon. As well as being a wildlife sanctuary, there is a small 'farm', with \\"Sheep Dog Shows\\". Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary opened their new world-class koala science and research facility, the Brisbane Koala Science Institute, on Saturday 30 June 2018. Constructed in collaboration with the Brisbane City Council, the facility is home to two full-time research staff, a research laboratory, and a ‚ÄòKoala Biobank‚Äô (koala genetic depository). Through joint projects with universities and other research establishments, the Institute will be working towards real, practical outcomes for local koala populations. Taking advantage of the sanctuary‚Äôs central location, Lone Pine hopes to improve collaboration within the science community through the use of the Institutes‚Äô meeting spaces and seminar hall. Guests to Lone Pine will be able to enjoy the Institute daily from 9am-5pm, via the public viewing area complete with interactive displays, koala skywalk, and viewing windows into the sanctuary‚Äôs wildlife kitchen, research laboratory, and wildlife hospital. Access to the facility is included in entry to the sanctuary. Transport There is an entrance to the sanctuary from a car park, and also an entrance to the sanctuary from the Brisbane River. One can arrive by private car or taxi, a journey of approximately 20 minutes from the city centre. One can also catch a Brisbane Transport bus, or arrive by ferry or express boat from the Queensland Cultural Centre pontoon.

Following Laura Widmer's resignation as the organization's CEO in November 2014, the Iowa State Daily Publication Board named Cunningham as her replacement in December 2014. Mark Witherspoon, or \\"Spoon\\", has served as the student newspaper's editorial adviser since 1999. Beginning in the fall of 2006, he became a full-time adviser.  History  In the spring of 1890, The I.A.C. Student was founded by a group of students led by F.E. Davidson at the Iowa Agricultural College. It was done without any support from the college or officials. The publication led the way for the Iowa Agricultural College Student, which formally launched on August 7, 1890. It was printed at Ames Intelligencer. The first issue stated: Seven issues later, the Student wrote: The Iowa Agricultural College Student was a bi-weekly newspaper until 1894, when it began publishing on a weekly basis at the cost of about 5 to 10 cents per issue. In March 1897, the I.A.C. Student was formally renamed The Student as it went from 8 pages to around 16 pages per issue. In 1900, The Student began publication twice a week. Two years later the newspaper was renamed yet again, this time to The Iowa State Student. It was about this time that the first courses in journalism were offered at Iowa State. In fall of 1905, a course in agricultural journalism was added to the course catalog. Home Economic students received a journalism course in 1911. Engineering journalism was added in 1920. The Department of Technical Journalism was created in 1927. During the newspaper's first 25 years it began to make a transition from personal and editorial-based stories to more news stories such as the assassination of President William McKinley, the fire that burnt down the Old Main Building, and the death of the college's former president William M. Beardshear. Most of the news stories were positive reports on the school's developments. Critical stories were rare but The Student did run a few. Sports coverage was another important coverage area. Baseball and football had been essentials at I.A.C for years, but basketball also became a popular sport, even though it took a while for the college to pick up on its popularity. On September 14, 1914, the newspaper undertook the task of publishing three days a week. The Student also accepted some suggestions by then university president Raymond Pearson. An editorial board made up of a couple faculty and about half a dozen students would have complete control over the editorial and business aspect of each issue. The paper would also be very cautious of printing anything to critical as to protect the reader. The newspaper's size also declined during this period to only about four pages by 1918 because of the war. In 1924, the Student united with Iowa Agriculturalist, Iowa Homemaker, and Iowa Engineer to create the Collegiate Press (later called the Iowa State University Press). The Collegiate Press and the College agreed to establish it as a nonprofit corporation and the College set aside the east basement of Agricultural Hall for printing. The acquiring of a Model A Duplex Press in 1926, allowed for morning publication. During the 1920s and 1930s The Iowa State Student focused on everything at Iowa State and left state, national and even city headlines out. The construction of the Memorial Union, the addition of new bells at the Campanile, the first VEISHEA celebrations, and the shocking death of football player Jack Trice were heavily covered. In March 1938, The Iowa State Student began publishing five times a week and was renamed The Iowa State Daily Student. An agreement between the College and the Collegiate Press resulted in the building of Collegiate Press Building. The building was renamed to \\"Press Building\\" in 1956, and to its current name of \\"Hamilton Hall\\" in 1984, after Carl Hamilton, who served for three years as head of the Department of Technical Journalism as well as two years in University Relations, and 17 years as Vice President for Information and Development. Hamilton also served as editor of The Iowa State Student from 1934 - 1935. During the World War II, The Iowa State Daily Student was forced to reduce the size from eight pages to four pages. By 1942, nearly every story and advertisement was linked to the campus's war effort and included sections \\"War Detail\\" and \\"Iowa State Men in the Services.\\" Women were also largely covered during this time with a section entitled \\"Women in Society.\\" This is due to the fact that a lot of Iowa State's men had gone to fight in the war. After the war, the newspaper began to publish stories for a wider audience, and not just for the students of Iowa State. On June 8, 1947, The Iowa State Daily Student was renamed The Iowa State Daily. Then editor Lee Schwanz observed that the generation on campus was made up of people who had been in the war and been to Europe and the Pacific, so he made a move toward covering more international, national, state, and local news. In the Spring 2017 semester the Daily began publishing an e-newsletter to all 36,000 plus students at the University. Students can opt-out of receiving the newsletter if they choose. The product has been opened for signups via the Daily's website to anyone who wishes to receive the e-newsletter. Separate newsletters for staff and alumni are possibilities being considered for the future. Beginning in the Fall 2017 semester, the Daily began printing on tabloid sized print. The decision was made as a way to save money over the more expensive broadsheet that had been used prior. As of the summer of 2020, the Daily has stopped publishing a print product due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Daily has since been operating exclusively digitally.

Winkfield was born in Chilesburg, Kentucky and began his career as a jockey in 1898 at age sixteen. He was suspended for four years after just one race for his involvement in a four-horse accident at the starting gate. However, he returned in 1900 to ride a horse named Thrive in the Kentucky Derby, finishing third. He rode the race again in 1901 and 1902, winning on His Eminence and Alan-a-Dale respectively. In 1901, he won 220 races. He competed in his final Derby in 1903, finishing second on Early. Winkfield was blackballed in the USA after dishonoring a contract to ride for a different owner after agreeing to ride for another one, but was offered a chance to race in Russia. He took the chance and quickly rose to fame. He won the Russian Oaks five times, the Russian Derby four times, the Czar's Prize on three occasions, and the Warsaw Derby twice. The Russian Revolution caused him to leave the country in 1917 and he moved to France where he resumed racing, scoring numerous wins including the Prix du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique, Grand Prix de Deauville, and the Prix Eug√®ne Adam. He retired as a jockey at age fifty having won more than 2,500 races then began a second successful career as a horse trainer. Winkfield lived on a farm near the Hippodrome de Maisons-Laffitte (racetrack) in Maisons-Laffitte on the outskirts of Paris. He remained there until fleeing the German occupation of France during World War II. After the war, he eventually returned to the farm at Maisons-Laffitte where he lived until his death 1974. While being treated with respect in Europe, segregation still ruled American society. When Sports Illustrated invited Winkfield to a reception at the Brown Hotel in Louisville in 1961, he was told he couldn't enter by the front door. In 1960, Jimmy Winkfield made an appearance at the Kentucky Derby to celebrate 60 years since his historic victories. In 2004 he was inducted posthumously into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The Jimmy Winkfield Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack is run in his honor. In 2005, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring Jimmy Winkfield.

The name ‚ÄúWratislavia Cantans‚Äù is the Latin phrase for ‚ÄúSinging Wroc≈Çaw‚Äù. The festival from the beginning has focused primarily on presenting the beauty of the human voice. Each year, concerts attract thousands of music lovers to the concert halls of the National Forum of Music, the historic interiors of Wroc≈Çaw and a dozen or so cities of Lower Silesia. In recent years, the festival has hosted, among others Philippe Herreweghe, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Zubin Mehta, Cecilia Bartoli, Julia Lezhneva, Philippe Jaroussky, Mariusz Kwiecie≈Ñ, Jordi Savall, Marcel P√©r√®s and such ensembles as: Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Collegium Vocale Gent, Akademie f√ºr Alte Musik Berlin, Monteverdi Choir, Gabrieli Consort & Players, Il Giardino Armonico, The Swingle Singers, and English Baroque Soloists. Since 2008, Andrzej Kosendiak has been the festival‚Äôs general director, and since 2013, the Italian conductor and instrumentalist Giovanni Antonini has been the artistic director. Festival venues From the beginning, the festival‚Äôs events take place in the historic interiors of Wroc≈Çaw, such as the churches: Basilica of St Elizabeth, Cathedral of St Mary Magdalene, Cathedral of St John the Baptist, University Church of the Holy Name of Jesus, Evangelical Augsburg Church of Divine Providence, Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross and Saint Bartholomew, and the White Stork Synagogue, as well as the Town Hall and university rooms (Aula Leopoldina, Oratorium Marianum). In the past, concert venues also included the Radio Wroc≈Çaw Concert Hall and the hall of the former Wroc≈Çaw Philharmonic. Apart from Wroc≈Çaw, Wratislavia Cantans concerts take place in the towns of Lower Silesia and Wielkopolska province, so far these have been: Bardo, Bielawa, Boles≈Çawiec, Brzeg, Dzier≈ºoni√≥w, G≈Çog√≥w, Jelcz-Laskowice, Jelenia G√≥ra, Kalisz, Kamieniec ZƒÖbkowicki, K≈Çodzko, Krotoszyn, Krzesz√≥w, Legnica, LubiƒÖ≈º, Lubomierz, Milicz, Ole≈õnica, O≈Çawa, Polkowice, Prochowice, Strzegom, Szczawno-Zdr√≥j, Syc√≥w, ≈öroda ≈ölƒÖska, ≈öwidnica, Trzebnica, Wa≈Çbrzych, Zgorzelec, and ≈ªmigr√≥d. Festival posters The authors of festival posters have been well-known Polish artists, such as Rafa≈Ç Olbi≈Ñski, Eugeniusz Get- Stankiewicz, Lech Majewski, and Micha≈Ç Batory. Membership of international organizations In 1978, the Wratislavia Cantans festival became a member of the European Festivals Association (EFA), which officially gave the event an international rank (although it has hosted foreign artists almost from the beginning). In 1998, the festival joined the International Society for the Performing Arts (ISPA). The festival also belongs to Music Masters on Air (MusMA) network. From 2015‚Äì2019 Wratislavia Cantans was awarded the Europe for Festivals, Festivals for Europe Label (EFFE Label). History Wratislavia Cantans was established by Andrzej Markowski, a composer and conductor, in 1966 as an oratorio and cantata festival. Markowski was director of the Wroc≈Çaw Philharmonic from 1965, and the Philharmonic was the host of this event. He served as festival director for eleven years. From 1978 to 1996, Tadeusz Struga≈Ça was the head of the festival, and added new elements to its programme: ethnic music and music of various religions, art exhibitions accompanying concerts, musical screenings, countertenor tournaments at the Silesian Piasts Castle in Brzeg, festival academies run by scholars, as well as academic sessions and a course on interpreting oratorio music. From 1991, the main organizer of the festival was the Culture and Art Centre in Wroc≈Çaw. From 1995‚Äì1998 the festival had a subtitle ‚ÄúMusic and Fine Arts‚Äù. In 1996, the festival was organized by the ‚ÄúWratislavia Cantans‚Äù State Institution of Culture, the International Music and Fine Arts Festival, and the management was divided between two persons: the general director and the artistic director. Lidia Geringer de Oedenberg became the general director, and artistic directors during her tenure were: from 1997 Ewa Michnik, from 2002 Mariusz Smolij, and from 2004 Jan Latham Koenig. Lidia Geringer de Oedenberg initiated cooperation with many Lower Silesian towns to organize festival concerts outside Wroc≈Çaw. In 2005, Andrzej Kosendiak became the festival‚Äôs general director and Paul McCreesh the artistic director. In 2014, the institutions of the International Festival Wratislavia Cantans and the Witold Lutos≈Çawski Philharmonic in Wroc≈Çaw were merged into one cultural institution, Witold Lutos≈Çawski National Forum of Music, who has since been the festival‚Äôs host. Since 2013, the artistic director of Wratislavia has been Giovanni Antonini, an Italian virtuoso and conductor, founder and director of the Baroque orchestra Il Giardino Armonico. Under his leadership, the following editions of the festival have been held so far: ‚ÄúJourney to Italy‚Äù (2013), ‚ÄúFrom Darkness to Light‚Äù (2014), ‚ÄúLong Live Wratislavia!‚Äù (2015; 50th anniversary edition), ‚ÄúRecitar Cantando‚Äù (2017) and ‚ÄúLiberation‚Äù (2018). In 2019, the festival takes place under the motto ‚ÄúSouth‚Äù.

In Tamazight, the regional Berber language, \\"ifran\\" means caves. The modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1928 during the protectorate era for their administration due to its Alpine climate. Ifrane was conceived as a ‚Äúhill station‚Äù or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans can find relief from the summer heat of tropical colonies. Ifrane is also a popular altitude training destination.Egan, E. Notes from higher grounds: an altitude training guide for endurance athletes, Kukimbia Huru Publishing The first permanent settlement of the area dates to the 16th century, when the Sharif of S√Æd√Æ 'Abd al-Sal√¢m established his community in the Tizguit Valley, seven km downstream from the present town. Ifrane is a colonial ‚Äúhill station‚Äù, and a ‚Äúgarden city‚Äù. It is also an ‚Äúimperial city‚Äù, a mountain resort, a provincial administrative center, and a college town. History The first permanent settlement of the area dates to the 16th century, when a shar√Æf by the name of S√Æd√Æ ‚ÄòAbd al-Sal√¢m established his community in the Tizguit Valley, seven km downstream from the present town. In Tamazight, the regional Berber language, yfran means ‚Äúcaves‚Äù. S√Æd√Æ ‚ÄòAbd al-Sal√¢m‚Äôs village, called Zaouiat Sidi Abdeslam (or simply the z√¢wiyah), consisted at first of cave dwellings hollowed out of the limestone valley wall. Only in the last fifty years or so have its inhabitants built houses aboveground. The caves which now lie under these houses are still used as mangers for animals and for storage. By the mid-17th century S√Æd√Æ ‚ÄòAbd al-Sal√¢m‚Äôs z√¢wiyah was well enough established to receive an extensive iqt√¢‚Äô, or land grant, from the ‚ÄòAl√¢w√Æ sultan M√ªl√¢y Rash√Æd b. Muhammad. The iqt√¢‚Äô extended from upstream of present Ifrane down the Tizguit valley all the way to El Hajeb escarpment. Late in the 19th century agro-pastoral groups of the Amazigh Senhadja Beni M‚Äôguild and Zenata the Ait Seghrouchen, crossing the Middle Atlas from the upper Moulouya Plain, started grazing their herds of sheep and goats on the surrounding plateau. The livelihood of the z√¢wiyah was based on irrigated agriculture on the valley floor, livestock grazing and forest resources. The agricultural plots were held as private property (mulk) but the grazing land was under collective tribal jurisdiction (j‚Äômaa). The tribally organized populations of the Ifrane- Azrou area submitted to colonial rule after a period of resistance (1913‚Äì1917). Resistance continued higher in the mountains (Timahdit, Jebel Fazzaz) until 1922. =Modern history= Ifrane Al Akhawayn University The modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1929 on land expropriated from the inhabitants of the z√¢wiya. The town was to be a \\"hill station,\\" a cool place for colonial families to spend the hot summer months, and it was initially planned according to the \\"garden city\\" model of urban design then in vogue. The plan called for chalet-type summer homes in the Alpine style, laid out among gardens and curving tree-lined streets. A royal palace was also built for Sultan Muhammad b. Y√ªsuf. The town's first public buildings consisted of a post office and a church. Moreover, a penitentiary was built which served as a POW camp during World War II. As elsewhere in Morocco, a shanty town called Timdiq√Æn soon grew up next to the colonial establishment. It housed the Moroccan population (maids, gardeners, etc.) that serviced the French vacationers. Timdiq√Æn was separated from the colonial garden city by a deep ravine. After independence the French properties in the original garden city were slowly bought up by Moroccans. The town was enlarged and endowed with a mosque, a municipal market and public housing estates. Furthermore, the shanty neighborhood of Timdiq√Æn was rebuilt with proper civic amenities. In 1979 Ifrane became the seat of the administrative province of the same name and some government services were established. In 1995 Al Akhawayn University, an English-language, American- curriculum public university opened and this has helped re-launch Ifrane as a desirable destination for domestic tourism. Consequently, Ifrane continues to develop as both a summer and winter resort. Old chalets in the center of town are being demolished and replaced with condominium complexes, while vacation centers and gated housing estates are springing up on the outskirts. The Middle Atlas Mountains consist mostly of a series of limestone plateaus. Not far from Ifrane in the Middle Atlas is C√®dre Gouraud Forest. These plateaus receive considerable precipitation‚Äîaveraging about 1100/1200 ml/year in Ifrane‚Äîand are naturally wooded, with scrub oak forests alternating with cedar. The Middle Atlas lies in the center of Morocco and constitutes its natural water tower, as many of the country's most important river systems: the Moulouya, the Sebou, the Bou Regreg, and the Oum Rbia originate in it. Historically, however, despite its centrality, the Middle Atlas has been an ‚Äúempty quarter.‚Äù Though the area was regularly crossed by traders, and though the alpine summer pasture was used by herders, the harsh climate and relatively poor soils long impeded permanent human settlement. Today the Middle Atlas is still one of the least densely populated parts of Morocco, even when compared to other mountainous regions such as the High Atlas and the Rif. A small fort overlooking Oued Tizguit (now part of the palace precinct) had already been built during the period of military conquest in order to secure the Fez to Khenifra road across the mountains. The gently rolling landscape, with fresh springs and wildflowers, was judged to have potential as a summer resort for colon families from the Sa√Øss Plain, Meknes and Fez. Fifty hectares of agricultural land upstream from the z√¢wiyah, in an area originally designated as Tourthit, or ‚Äúgarden,‚Äùwas expropriated for the project. Ifrane was conceived as a ‚Äúhill station‚Äù or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans can find relief from the summer heat of tropical colonies. The British were the first to develop this type of resort in India, the best known of which is Simla in the Himalayas which served as their ‚Äúsummer capital.‚Äù The French built similar hill stations in Indochina, such as Dalat established in 1921. Ifrane was not the only hill station to be built in Morocco. The French also built one in neighboring Immouzer, as well as at Oukaimeden in the High Atlas. Hill stations share some common characteristics. As they are intended for expatriate European families, and they are often designed in such a way as to remind their foreign inhabitants of their distant homelands. The architectural style adopted is imported from the mother country in order that the place look like ‚Äúlittle England‚Äù or ‚Äúdouce France.‚Äù This is the case in Ifrane where various mountain styles such as ‚Äúmaison basque‚Äù ‚ÄúJura‚Äù and ‚ÄúSavoy‚Äù were used. Moreover, trees and flowering plants were also imported from the European home country. This too was intended to heighten the appearance and feeling of home. In Ifrane, lilac trees, plane trees (platanes), chestnut trees (marronniers and ch√¢taigniers) and linden trees (tilleuls) were all imported for this purpose.  \\"Garden City\\" Sculpture of a lion in a park of the city Ifrane was planned according to the ‚Äúgarden city‚Äù model of urban design, fashionable in Western Europe between the two world wars.Robin Gauldie, Morocco The concept of the garden city was developed in Britain as a model of social reform to solve the problems of 19th century industrial cities. By the 1920s however it had lost its social purpose to become an urban design type. Garden cities required low density housing consisting of fully detached or semi- detached single family homes surrounded by gardens. In order to break with industrial-era grid plans, garden cities were always laid out with curving tree-lined streets. In fact, most garden cities were affluent suburbs, not true cities in their own right. They catered to the tastes of the upper middle classes who could afford to own a private automobile and property in the suburbs. They gave the illusion of county life, with village-type architecture, curvy streets and many trees, to people who in reality worked in big cities. Ifrane's initial garden city plan was designed in 1928 in Rabat by the Services Techniques of the Bureau de Contr√¥le des Municipalit√©s, a division of the Direction des Affairs Politiques. The 1928 plan - for the neighborhood known as Hay Riad today - had typical garden city features: curvy streets named for flora (Rue des lilas, Rue des tilleuls, etc.), and chalet- style houses. Houses could occupy only 40% of plots; the rest had to be planted as a garden. Moreover, large parts of the center of the town consisted of public gardens. Some of the original architecture can still be seen, especially in the neighborhood around the town hall and the Perce Neige Hotel. The summer homes built by the colons were designed by many of the same architects who built the European parts of Casablanca and Rabat. Whereas the European architecture in these big cities was innovative and intentionally modern, Ifrane's houses were built in traditional European styles and resembled those in the suburbs of contemporaneous French cities. Ifranes's first public buildings were a post office and a Catholic church. The church, consecrated in 1939, was designed by Paul Tournon (1881‚Äì1964), a recipient of the prestigious Prix de Rome who had also designed the Sacr√© Coeur Church in Casablanca. The resort function of the new town was consolidated with the building of a number of hotels. Ifrane's first flagship hotel was the Balima, which was demolished in the 1980s. The other main hotel was the Grand H√¥tel, which has recently been refurbished. A royal palace was also built for Sultan Muhammad b.Y√ªsuf. Ifrane is thus an ‚Äúimperial‚Äù city in that it houses a palace and benefits from royal patronage. One final institution of Ifrane's early years worthy of mention is the penitentiary which no longer exists, and the site, across from the Police Academy and the new police Commissariat, has been redeveloped as a summer camp for the Ministry of Justice. The penitentiary served as a Prisoner of War camp during World War II. The popular story of the origin of Ifrane's lion sculpture involves an Italian inmate of this prison sculpting the lion out of an outcrop of limestone, however this is not true as the lion dates from at least 1936 thus predating World War II. The garden city hill station high in the Middle Atlas was always going to be an illusion of suburban middle class France. The colonial reality of the place was manifest in two ways. First of all the inhabitants of Zaouiat Sidi Abdeslam, the original owners of the land on which the town was built, were never properly compensated for their loss. Secondly, the town plan was incomplete. Provisions were made for the housing and infrastructure of colonial home-owners, but not for the Moroccan maids, gardeners or guards who worked for them. Finding no housing in the official allotments, these people had to build their own houses some distance away, across a ravine north of the town. As elsewhere in Morocco at the time, a shantytown thus grew up next to the colonial town. This is the origin of Timdiqin (officially called Hay Atlas). Climate Because of its elevation, the town experiences snow during the winter months and a cool climate during the summer. Located in the Atlas Mountains, and affected by the cold north Atlantic current, Ifrane has an oceanic climate with continental influence, or a warm-summer Mediterranean climate in the K√∂ppen climate classification. The climate shifts from cold in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights can be severely cold in winter. The winter highs rarely exceed in December‚ÄìFebruary. Owing to the city's elevation and proximity to the north Atlantic Ocean, rainfall is very heavy whenever frontal systems affect the region. Precipitation patterns follow the classic Mediterranean range, from October to April. The city also receives high snowfall starting as early as October and lasting well into spring season. The annual average temperature does not exceed 11 ¬∞C. Ifrane holds the record of the lowest temperature ever observed in Africa: on February 11, 1935. Flora and fauna Ifrane's biodiversity is unique. Its fauna and flora contain rare yet mostly endangered species. Animals to be found in the vicinity include the threatened Barbary macaque.C. Michael Hogan, 2008) Among the local tree species are the native Atlas cedar, scrub oak and the introduced London plane. Fauna Ifrane's fauna is rich and diverse. Some of the mammals‚Äô species that can be seen in region include: * The Barbary Macaque (Macaca sylvanus): is an endangered monkey species that lives in its wild state in the forests of the Middle Atlas, and thus if the forests surrounding Ifrane. Barbary Macaques can be seen in the outskirts or the farther areas of the town of Ifrane when there is no more food in the woods, or simply because they have become familiar with humans. * The Golden Jackal (Canis aureus): is a canid species that lives in the forests of Ifrane. The natives call it ‚Äòich‚Äôab‚Äô in Tamazight, the same for ‚Äòwolf‚Äô. * The Caracal (Caracal caracal): is a wildcat species that lives in the forests surrounding Ifrane. It is hard to perceive, and thus maintained thanks to its extreme discretion. * The Common Genet (Genetta genetta): is a species that can be seen frequently in the region of Ifrane. However, it has the habit of eating farmers‚Äô and natives‚Äô chicken. Therefore, it gets hunted and trapped by humans. Some of the most interesting bird species available in Ifrane are: * The Atlas Coal Tit (Parus ater Atlas): is an endemic passerine bird native to the Atlas mountains range. * The Crimson Winged Finch (Rhodopechys sanguineus): is a crimson-colored finch that can be found in the Ifrane region. * The White Scavenger Vulture (Neophron percnopterus): is a rare Old World vulture. Ifrane is also well known for its pisciculture (fish farming) stations. Ras el Ma forest has a trout-breeding station in which you can watch trouts in their breeding basins. Moreover, Ifrane has a varied range of insects and amphibians. Flora Ifrane's plant and tree species include the following: * The Atlas Cedar (Cedrus Atlantica) * The Green Oak (Quercus rotundifolia) * The Portuguese Oak (Quercus faginea) * The Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster ssp. Hamiltoni var. maghrebiana) * The Spanish Juniper (Juniperus thurifera) * Genista quadrifolia * Cistus laurifolius * Artemisia mesatlantica Notes References * Inventaire de la Biodiversit√©. (2016).

During his 45-year career, Levine reported from more than two dozen countries. He was the first American television correspondent to be accredited in the Soviet Union. He wrote three non-fiction books on life in the USSR, each of which became a bestseller. Early life and education Born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Levine graduated from Brown University. Career In 1940 Levine went into journalism, starting at the Providence Journal as an obituary writer. During World War II, he served with the Army Signal Corps. After completing graduate school at the Columbia University School of Journalism, Levine started working for the International News Service.

These included the USSR, where in 1955, he became the first American television correspondent to receive accreditation. He had accompanied some American farming experts there, and stayed for four years to report on the country. He later recounted that during 1955, he was approached to be a Soviet spy but he refused and, despite threats and being followed, managed to continue reporting. He was named bureau chief of Rome, where he served for nearly 12 years, also being stationed in Vienna and Tokyo. His reporting on Europe included accounts of the 1961 construction of the Berlin Wall by East Germany; the Vatican II Ecumenical Council, which opened in 1962; and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the USSR.

TIME magazine described him as a \\"pioneer\\" in economics reporting on television. As a national correspondent, Levine became known for his distinctive sign-off, slightly stressing his middle initial. He wore bow ties when reporting on screen. Famed for his impeccable grammar and diction, Levine made a crossover to entertainment, with a self-mocking appearance on Saturday Night Live. He also played on his national reputation by appearing on the series Murphy Brown. Levine was interviewed by David Letterman and Jay Leno on their respective shows. When asked what he would miss most moving from NBC to CBS late night, Letterman answered, \\"backrubs from Irving R. Levine.\\" His final interview prior to retirement was with Tom Brokaw.

Their homeland, the former Igala Kingdom, is an approximately triangular area of about 14,000 km2 in the angle formed by the Benue and Niger rivers. The area was formerly the Igala Division of Kabba province, and is now part of Kogi State. The capital is Idah in Kogi state. History The first \\"Ata\\", the title given to the ruler of the kingdom, was Ebule- Jonu, a woman; she was succeeded by her brother Agana- Poje, the father of Idoko. Idoko would later succeed him as Ata, and had two children Atiyele and Ayegba om'Idoko (Ayegba son of Idoko), Atiyele the first son of Idoko migrated eastward of the kingdom to establish Ankpa kingdom while Ayegba the second son of Idoko succeeded his father as Ata'Gala. He led a war against the Jukun, which resulted in victory. Idakwo Micheal was appointed as the new Ata in December 2012. The ata-ship of Igala rotated among four branches of the royal clan. Igala Kingdom was founded by Abutu- Eje in the 16th century. The kingdom was ruled by nine high officials called the Igala Mela who are custodians of the sacred Earth shrine. The Igala mega state attained the height of its fame during the mid-17th century.The Idah-Benin war (1515-1516) was a war of mutual independence. The Igala state reached its political and commercial supremacy afterwards, when it became a leading exporter of choral beads, horses, medicine, skills and of course, slaves to the coastal region. Its growing economic power, nevertheless, changed the dynamics of the earlier complex relationships with several Idoma communities. The Igala people are found in villages and towns across the 36 states of Nigeria. In each town or village where they are more than a thousand of Igala people, a chief (Oga Attah) which is a representative of the Attah Igala is crowned. The Oga Attah then oversees Igala Cultural and Development Association (ICDA) as the paramount ruler.  Culture  The Igala kingdom is ruled by an \\"Attah\\".

Production Valley of the Dolls was recorded at Wessex Sound Studios in Islington in October 1978.'Generation X - Day by Day' website (2018). http://www.nemsworld.com/genx/daybyday.htm The record's working title was 'Intercourse (Old Meets New)', which was superseded by a name taken from a 1966 novel.'Gen X set 18 dates', New Musical Express, 11 November 1978. Ian Hunter was commissioned as the record's producer at Tony James's request, from having been a fan of his work with Mott the Hoople in the early 1970s. The record was Generation X's second long-player release, and displayed the band transitioning from its origins in the London Punk Rock scene of the late-1970s into a more mainstream rock music sound, with the incorporation of musical influences ranging from Glam Rock, Progressive Rock, and Bruce Springsteen's mid-1970s work, and was in part aimed at providing the band with a means of entry into the United States market, and gearing up the scale of the band's sound to move from playing in club venues to theatres and arenas.'Dancing with Myself' by Billy Idol (Pub. Simon & Schuster, 2014). In pre-release music press interviews for the record Billy Idol presented it as a departure from the punk movement by the band: > \\"I think with this album we've exorcised the ghost of punk rock, people > always saw punk as unmusical, and we aim to show that we've got ideas, and > that we're individuals and not just following what everyone else does. > Generation X is its own band. This LP is a lot different from our last, > which didn't have enough staying power, this new one doesn't wear off so > easily and we think it will last longer.\\"Interview with Billy Idol, 'Disco > 45 magazine', December 1978. On release in January 1979 the record performed disappointingly in the UK Albums Chart, and contributed substantially to Generation X's demise as a band at the year's end. In a later interview with the New Musical Express, Tony James, the band's bass-player and song-writing lyricist attributed the record's failure commercially and artistically to: > \\"I was in love with the rock and roll myth. I'd read (Mick Farren's novel) > The Tale of Willy's Rats, and thought it was wonderful. I certainly had a > romantic vision of rock and roll groups, and I think with the Valley of the > Dolls album we reached an all time bottom in that rock and roll romanticism. > After the album came out I realised that I'd been talking about things that > I didn't really understand, or which even were just not true. Afterwards we > realised we had to sing about what we knew about, not what we wished we > were.\\"'The Ballad of Billy & Tony, New Musical Express, 21 February 1981. Concerns from the record's producer Ian Hunter about the technical competence of Generation X's drummer led to the employment for the recording sessions of Clive Bunker as a session musician.'Running with the Boss Sound', article by Derwood Andrews, 'Mojo' magazine, February 2008.

Ikare-Akoko (Ikare for short), city in southwestern Nigeria, is located in the Northern District of Ondo State. Ikare is about 100;km from Akure, the Ondo State capital. The city was the divisional headquarters of the old Akoko Division, comprising Oka-Akoko, Isua-Akoko, Okeagbe-Akoko etc. Based on the Local Government System now practised in Nigeria, the city is currently the headquarters of Akoko North-East Local Government. The city is a trading point for the production of Cocoa in the surrounding area Ikare is ruled by the Olukare of Ikare Oba Alhaji Akadiri Saliu Momoh 1V JP CON . Oja Oba is situated in front of Olukare's palace as in other Yoruba ancient towns. The city is located in the Yoruba cultural region and has a substantial Christian, Jehovah Witness and Muslim population with several Churches, worshiping halls and Mosques. The architectural style of the city incorporates both Portuguese and Arabic styles. The Portuguese style was introduced in the 16th century when Portugal began to export slaves from the region. Arabic influences were incorporated in the 19th century with the diffusion of Islamic culture Southward across the Sahara. Population as of 2006 was over 700,000. Education Ikare is home to several educational institutions in Ondo State. Notable among which are; Ondo State College of Art and Science {now Federal Technical College, Ikare}; Victory College Ikare; Citadel International College, Ikare; Comprehensive high School,Ikare; Greater Tomorrow Primary School and so many government and private-owned Primary and Secondary Schools. Ikare sons and daughters are well educated and are presently holding national and international positions. Markets Ikare is a chief commercial city in Ondo state with several industrial base and markets which include; Oja-Oba Market, Okore Market, Osele Market, Jubilee Market, and several other markets in adjoining Villages. It is a super city for successful transportation business especially by private individuals. Inter Ethnic Relationships Ikare though basically a Yoruba ethnic city, is also a place of convergence in Ondo State for many ethnic groups in Nigeria namely Igbo, Hausa, Fulani, Ijaw,and so on. The friendly disposition of its natives to visitors and holiday makers, from time immemorial, is perhaps responsible for the growing number of settlers in the city. Festival Ikare has a rich cultural heritage with exciting festivals every year. The popular new yam festival is the chief festival in Ikare which is celebrated every June 20. On this day, Ikare sons and daughters both home and abroad come together to celebrate what is usually termed the starting point of a new year for Ikare land. The festival also features Masquerade parade, such as Oke, Seeru, GanGan among others. There is also the Aringiya Festival (Maiden Festival)where virgin will paint themselves with Osun (Camwood) and go around the town nude, before converging at a designated point. However, Islamic festivals such as Eid-Maulud, Eid Fitr, Eid Kabir as well as Christian festivals such as Christmas, Easter and also the New Year Festival celebrated on every first day of January had almost overshadowed the Cultural Festivals. All these point to the fact that Ikare is a very religious city.

It was founded in the 15th century by the Buddhist monk Senno. The school is based at the Rokkaku-d≈ç temple in Kyoto. The name is derived from a pond (ike) where Prince Sh≈çtoku (ËÅñÂæ≥Â§™Â≠ê) was bathing. History Illustration from the Ka≈ç irai no Kadensho, believed to be the oldest extant manuscript of ikebana teaching, dating from a time shortly after that of Ikenob≈ç Senkei. It shows various arranging styles of tatehana (ogibana) wide-mouth (right) and upright styles The custom of placing flowers on the altar began when Buddhism was introduced to Japan by way of emissaries to China in about 538. In Japan people tried to give deeper meaning to the thoughts accompanying flower arranging. In other words, they wished to arrange flowers (tateru, to arrange stems in an upright or standing manner), rather than casually placing them in a vase. An earlier attitude of passive appreciation developed into a more deeply considered approach. Early forms of Ikebana referred to as tatehana were arranged. The Rokkaku-d≈ç in Kyoto is the site of the birth and earliest development of ikebana. The name Rokkaku refers to the hexagonal shape of the temple. Rokkaku-d≈ç temple was founded by Prince Sh≈çtoku in the 6th century to enshrine a Nyoirin Kannon Bosatsu, the Goddess of Mercy. Near a pond (ike) where Prince Sh≈çtoku bathed, a small hut (b≈ç; priest's lodge, monk's living house attached to a Buddhist templeKenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, Kenkyusha Limited, Tokyo 1991, ) was built and became the home of succeeding generations of Buddhist priests. This gave rise to the name ikenob≈ç. In the temple grounds, one stone is called Heso- ishi. It means \\"bellybutton stone\\". It is said that it was the foundation stone of the original temple. Because this temple existed before the transfer of the national capital to Kyoto in 794, it has been claimed to be the center of the city. In the Heian period (794-1192), apart from altar offerings, the practice of enjoying flowers displayed beautifully in a vase became popular. Poems, novels and essays from that time contain many passages that describe the appreciation of flowers used in this way. In the early 7th century Ono no Imoko, a former Japanese envoy to China, became a Buddhist priest and started setting up flowers.https://www.britannica.com/art/Ikenobo According to a 15th- century manuscript, the two of the most popular flower arrangers of the time were ikenob≈ç master Senkei and Ryu-ami, a tea master. Unzen Taigyoku, a monk belonging to a Zen Monastery, first recorded the name Senkei in his journal called Hekizan Nichiroku. In an entry dated February 25 of the third year of the Kansh≈ç era (1462), Unzen Taigyoku wrote, ‚Äúat the invitation of Shunko, Senkei made a floral arrangement in a golden vase and denizens of Kyoto with refined tastes vied to see his work‚Äù. This written record marks the starting point for 550 years of recorded ikebana history. Additional historical documentation of Senkei‚Äôs work includes only one entry, on October 2, in the Nekizan Nichiroku journal describing how moved he was by the extraordinary beauty of chrysanthemums. =Rikka style = Important Cultural Property) From the late Kamakura period to the Muromachi period (late 13th -16th century), flower arranging contests were held at the imperial court on the day of Tanabata (the festival of the star Vega, the seventh day of the seventh lunar month). These contests were called Tanabata-e . Aristocrats and monks vied with each other in demonstrating their skills, offering flowers in honor of the festival. Use of the family name Ikenob≈ç was granted by the Emperor of the time. Succeeding generations of head priests of the temple used this name. Toward the end of the Muromachi period the earlier simple way of setting flowers in a vase developed into tatehana (tateru, standing; hana, flowers), a more complex style of ikebana. During this period the oldest extant manuscript of ikebana (Kao irai no Kadensho, 1486) and the famous manuscript about ikebana by Ikenob≈ç Senno (Senno Kuden, 1542) were written. Senno, the founder of Ikenob≈ç kad≈ç, originated ikebana that was imbued with meaning (kad≈ç or way of flowers). Previously, tatehana had more of a connection to the spiritual practice of Yorishiro. The Azuchi-Momoyama period (late 16th century) brought a renaissance in ikebana as part of a cultural renaissance. Two Ikenob≈ç masters named Senk≈ç I and II, completed the rikka (Á´ãËä±) style (also meaning standing flowers, but with more complexity than tatehana) and Ikenob≈ç reached a high point of its early history. Paintings depicting the rikka of Senk≈ç II, a famous master of ikenob≈ç, are preserved at the Manshuin Temple in Kyoto) the Yomei-bunko library of the Ninnaji Temple in Kyoto, the Tokyo National Museum and the library of ikenob≈ç headquarters. The arranging of rikka as a style with severn main parts later developed into the modern standard nine part rikka (shin, soe, uke, mikoshi, nagashi, doe, hikai,maeoki, and shoe-shin) was established at this time. After Senk≈ç II died, rikka gradually became more complex and mannered. The birth of the sh≈çka style of ikebana brought new interest into the world of ikebana. After his death, an at times violent feud broke out between his two main disciples Daijuin Ishin and Anry≈´b≈ç Sh≈´gyoku about the direction of the school. File:Á´ãËä±Âõ≥Âπ∂Á†ÇÁâ© 72.jpgRikka arrangement by Sh≈´gyoku (from Rikka-zu narabini Sunamono-zu) File:Â§ß‰ΩèÈô¢Á´ãËä±Á†ÇÁâ©Âõ≥ 47.jpgRikka arrangement by Daijuin (from Daijuin Rikka Sunamono-zu) = From Nageirebana to Sh≈çka style= Nageirebana (ÊäïÂÖ•Ëä±), a more informal style of arrangement, had been practiced even during the earlier period when rikka was developing. Nageirebana was a style of decoration for the zashiki, while rikka, the most formal style, was used for rites and ceremonies. The townspeople favored nageirebana, which presented the natural beauty of flowers without complicated rules. In 1684, Toichiya Taemon, a merchant, wrote the Nageire Kadensho (How to arrange flowers in Nageire style), and in 1697, Kodai Sh≈çka Zukan (Collected Paintings of Historic Sh≈çka Works) by Ikenob≈ç Sen'y≈ç was published. Nageire influenced the development of early work in the sh≈çka (ÁîüËä±) style. Sh≈çka at this time was very simple. Only two main branches (or flowers), one of which was called in (negative) and the other yo (positive), were used in arranging the work. These would later develop into three main parts, called shin, soe and tai. The sh≈çka style developed over a long period, with many schools of ikebana other than Ikenob≈ç appeared. Sh≈çka was firmly established in Ikenob≈ç Senjo's work Soka Hyakki (One Hundred Examples of Ikebana, 1820). He also edited Heika Yodo-shu, in which the traditional methods of rikka were described in detail. In the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), Ikenob≈ç Sensh≈ç set down the regulations of shofutai sh≈çka, shofutai meaning orthodox or traditional style. Mannerism again began to appear. Efforts to break away from mannerism were not successful until the Taish≈ç era (1912‚Äì1926). The styles of modern nageire and moribana and modern styles of sh≈çka were the result. These styles were influenced by the importation of European culture, beginning during the Meiji Restoration (1868). = Shimputai style = Shimputai, a new style of sh≈çka, developed in 1977 by 45th generation Headmaster Ikenob≈ç Sen'ei, presents a bright, modern feeling. Two main parts, shu and yo, respond to each other with contrasting yet harmonious qualities. A third part of the arrangement, ashirai, is often added as a finishing touch. Following a period of development of shimputai the new principals were also applied to Rikka and Rikka Shimputai has become popular in the twenty-first century. = Jiy≈´ka = Jiy≈´ka free style arrangements Jiy≈´ka is the free style.

Nearby major towns include Imota, Isiu, Liadi, Egbin, Ijede, Igbogbo and Bayeku, all of which constitute their own Local Council Development Area with their own traditional rulers (Obas). Together these areas make up Ikorodu Division. Ikorodu Division has a large industrial area containing several factories. The town of Ikorodu itself is home to branches of several established Nigerian banks. Ikorodu is the fastest growing part-exurb of Lagos metropolis, owing in part to increasing influx of people from Ikorodu's surrounding towns and villages attracted by the town's proximity to Lagos. In 2003, the existing Ikorodu LGAs was split for administrative purposes into Local Council Development Areas. These lower-tier administrative units now number 6: Imota, Igbogbo/Bayeku, Ijede, Ikorodu North, Ikorodu West, Ikorodu. Religion Inhabitants of Ikorodu include adherents to several religions, including Christianity, Islam, and traditional worship. Education Within greater Ikorodu there are 57 public primary schools and 12 secondary schools. There are also several private nurseries, primary and secondary schools, and two tertiary institutions.

A skid mark is the visible mark left by any solid which moves against another, and is an important aspect of trace evidence analysis in forensic science and forensic engineering. Skid marks caused by tires on roads occur when a vehicle wheel stops rolling and slides or spins on the surface of the road. Skid marks can be analyzed to find the maximum and minimum vehicle speed prior to an impact or incident. Skidding can also occur on black ice or diesel deposits on the road and may not leave a mark at all. Characteristics Skid mark from a faulty ladder. Skid marks are divided into \\"acceleration marks\\" created on acceleration, if the engine provides more power than the tire can transmit; \\"braking marks,\\" if the brakes \\"lock up\\" and cause the tire to slide; or \\"yaw marks\\", if the tire slides sideways. Each skid mark has a characteristic appearance, and an experienced accident reconstructor or forensic engineer can often determine what the vehicle was doing by examining the marks left by the tire. Different road surfaces produce different kinds of skid marks, sometimes also referred to as scuff marks or tire marks. On asphalt road surfaces, skid marks are usually the result of bituminous oils in the asphalt that are heated because of the friction of braking or accelerating and rise to the surface, leaving dark marks.Carty, G. Collision Reconstruction. Nov 3, 2016. Mississauga, ON : University of Toronto Mississauga. This kind of mark Tire marks on asphalt can last for months or even a year or two if they are particularly dark and the roadway is not well traveled. On other road surfaces, such as concrete, the marks result from the deposition of tire compounds onto the surface of the roadway. This kind of skid mark is typical of airport runways, which need to be periodically cleaned to remove deposited debris that reduce the frictional coefficient of the runwayD.P. Eisenbeisz, Wikipedia Talk response. June 28, 2008.Miranda, M. Tire Marks & Their Role in Accident-Reconstruction Investigations. Jan 8, 2018. PInow.com. The durability of these marks depends on a number of factors, including road use, tire compounds, weather, and frequency of road cleaning. Braking marks will vary depending on whether the car uses ABS or not. If not, there will be two lines. The darker marks on the outside are from the front wheels, while the back tires leave thinner marks. This is because the force exerted makes the wheels take on a conical shape. If the car uses ABS, the marks will be much fainter as less heat is produced by the release-stop mechanism of ABS. Scuff marks may be visible however with ABS. Ladder accidents Skid marks can also be formed where a ladder suddenly slips and the user falls to the ground, especially if the ladder feet are faulty or absent. Loss of the rubber feet or foot causes the aluminum stile to make contact with the ground, and if a hard surface like concrete or tiling, a skid mark shows how and why the ladder slipped. Unless fixed to the wall upon which they are leaning, ladders can slip down easily, especially if the ladder is leaned at an angle lower than about 75 degrees. Such slip accidents tend to happen when the user is near the top of the ladder, increasing his or her chances of serious personal injury. Accident reconstruction Such marks are important evidence for vehicular accident reconstruction, when their size and shape can reveal much about vehicle speed and forces of acceleration or deceleration. They are one form of trace evidence. They represent a form of contact evidence produced according to Locard's exchange principle. The length of the skid mark is usually closely related to the vehicle speed at the instant of braking, so measuring the marks yields an estimate of original speed. Other uses In modern slang, the term \\"skid mark\\" means a fecal stain or smear on the back of one's underwear.

Ilaro town houses about 57,850 people. Ilaro\\"Ilaro.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. Web. 29 Mar. 2011. . is the headquarters of the Yewa South Local government, now known as YEWALAND which replaced the Egbado division of the former Western State, and later became a part of Ogun State of Nigeria. Ilaro town is about 50 km from Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, and about 100 km from Ikeja, the capital city of Lagos State. Close to this monument is the town hall named after the honourable warrior \\"‚ÄôOrona‚Äô Hall\\". The statue of Oronna and his Leopard (picture above) are still there for tourists and lovers of history to see. Osata was an Ancient Ilaro ruler in the 19th century who sacrificed his own son for his people to enjoy abundance of rainfall at a time Ilaro was plagued with drought.Oral story of Ilaro town as told by Pa James Aderounmu Oniyide, of Iga Ekerin Compound , Ilaro Ogun State , Nigeria The dialect spoken in Ilaro is the Egbado dialect. When Ilaro indigenes meets outside home, the shout of ‚ÄúOmo Oluwewun‚Äù has a magical power of unifying the \\"Ilu Aro\\" people.  Agriculture and Industry  In the past the major occupation of the Yewa/Egbado people was mostly farming of arable crops and cash crops like cocoa, coffee, kola nuts, oranges, and pineapples. Other farm products included Cassava, yam, okra, rice, bananas, plantains, water leaf, and spinach. Mineral resources found in Ilaro include Phosphate and limestone. The Ilaro soils are mostly loamy and humus, rich in manure and elements that support the growth of cocoa, cashew, pawpaw, kola nut, maize, sugarcane, and potatoes at plantation and mechanized levels. Due to a very thick forest, the major industry of the Ilaro people is the timber industry. There are several timber milling industries spread at the outskirts of the town for the production of planks and plywood for both local consumption and exportation. Industries in Ilaro town include the local fufu and gari processing industries, the timber/plank making industries the local Aso Oke weaving industry, paint industry and cement industry located some few kilometers from the Ilaro town a few minutes walking distance from the Ibese town.  History  Ilaro was founded in the 18th century by Aro who migrated from the Oyo townPrince Kehinde Olugbenle ‚ÄúIlaro history‚Äú found at http://ilarotown.com/Our_History.html to settle down in Igbo Aje, a little hill situated at the centre of the town from where he and his warriors could sight enemies (mostly slave traders from the neighbouring Benin republic known then as Dahomey) on attack from a long distance. Aro himself was a warrior and a hunter to be reckoned with. Ilaro had her name from \\"Ilu Aro\\" meaning the settlement of Aro which later became Ilaro for ease of pronunciation. Ancient Ilaro town was blessed with great farmers, hunters and warriors out of which Orona and Osata ranked the files of Ilaro history. In the history laid by these humble kinsmen and peace-loving individuals, apart from saving the lives of their kinsmen from the hands of the invading Dahome and other warriors, news had it that Orona with his \\"Ekun\\" (Leopard) when he became old and wanted to show the potency of His powers entered into the ground and told his people to call upon him whenever there is problem, i.e. in times of war, by just pulling the chain attached to himself and the leopard as at the time of entering the ground. This place where Orona disappeared into the ground with his Leopard is today known as the Orona Shrine and has been renovated and constructed as an emolument for lovers of history and tourists. It is also the location where the coronation of every new traditional ruler of the town is performed. The Orona Ilaro Festival is celebrated annually in remembrance of the great warrior. During the Nigerian Civil War, Ilaro acted as the headquarters of the Egbado land and produced brave warriors who fought for the sustenance of the unity of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Notable of these patriots include Major General Olurin (Rtd), late brigadier general Samuel Adegoriola Oniyide, late Major Onifade and the Late Major Ibikunle Armstrong. Apart from warriors, the Ilaro town also produced renowned Yoruba literature guru Prof. Afolabi Olabimitan who later became a politician few years before his death and was also a delegate to the Nigerian Constitutional conference in 1999. He authored Kekere Ekun, this being his first novel published in 1967. He also authored ‚ÄúTa lo p‚Äôomo Oba?\\" and other literatures. Until his death he was a member of the ‚ÄúAkomolede Yoruba\\" group and a former Don at the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The aforementioned people contributed in part to the development of Ilaro town as either moralist worthy of emulation, educators, devoters of religion, principal of secondary schools in Ilaro, former sole administrators / governors, former speaker of the Ogun state house of assembly, Minister of State for Education, secretary to the Yewa south local government, Philanthropists, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, gubernatorial candidate, member of the house of assembly, as the case may be. Also apart from these people there are also indigents of Ilaro that are spread all over cities and other towns in Nigeria and as well as around the world in Europe, in the United States of America, in Asia, in various islands and some countries in Africa such as Ivory Coast, Ghana, Libya, Senegal, Cameroon, Niger Republic and the neighbouring Republic of Benin. In addition, there are different Iga (Compounds) and communities associated with indegents of Ilaro that give every individual a point reference to the exact compound or community where he / she originated from within the town. Examples are Iga Ekerin, Iga Badagunro, Iga Babaolu, Iga Saatun, Iga Papa-nla, Iga Modeolu, Iga basasin,Iga sawo, Ile-Eeleri Ile-Olooja-meje, Iga keeke, Ita Alaran, Ilu-Ata, Oju-okeke, oju-Alumuwa, Oju-Obe,Oke-Ibese oju-Omofe, Oju oronna,Ona otun,Ona- Osi, Ona-Ola,Isale Idomo, Ile marun, Oju Yewa, Iga elemo. etc. Ilaro town had a very good romance with the missionaries from Europe in the 19th and the 20th centuries. History had it that the likes of the Late Lord Lugard, Late Mary Slessor visited the Ancient Ilaro town. Many missionaries lived the whole of their lives as Chaplains and as medical doctors in Ilaro town and in remembrance of this, the longest street in Ilaro to date is named Leslie Street after J. Leslie.  Culture  The Ilaro people have a very rich cultural heritage. The Ilaro people are the originator of the ‚ÄúBolojo‚Äú and the ‚Äúgelede‚Äù dance. The language of communication at the Gelede dances is songs known as ‚ÄúEFE‚Äù which is mostly composed to expose and correct ills done by people in the neighbourhood. One wouldn't know that one is being noticed at every bad steps one took until a visit to a Bolojo dance performance or the gelede dance stand when specific songs will be composed and rendered to one's hearing. Listen to the EFE and you will have the cause to laugh stress as well as sorrows out of your life.

It is watered by Ojutu River, Erinle River, Konda River and a few other streams. The town is said to have been founded by Laarosin, a powerful warrior in the Old Oyo Empire. It has a population of about 30,825 (2006 census). People and culture The Ilobu people's tradition and culture has to do with the way they live, govern themselves, their religion, language, dressing pattern, arts, festivals and the rules they set for themselves. They have a very strong sense of community and this has enhanced mutual understanding and meaningful development in the town. Arts and crafts Ilobu is a big arts and crafts centre in Nigeria. These include metal crafts, weaving, painting and sculpturing and leather work. The dyeing of clothes known as \\"adire\\" is well known in Ilobu. It is a special art of tying and dyeing of clothes to bring out unique designs. It is very popular all over the world. Traditional religion beliefs Erinle is an annual festival of worship within the town where ram with pounded yam and Sekete wine - a traditional wine - are used to worship. Everybody in the town, both males and females, worship Erinle with Olobu the king. On the fifth day, Erinle images would be brought out. Twenty- eighth day notice would be given, around August before the actual festival in September. Erinle had been worshipped before the arrival of Islam and Christianity. The ram would not be killed but would be thrown into the river alive. Akodo is the priest and there are many spots in the river called Ibus which represented where Erinle‚Äôs son are living. The significance of the festival is linked to the continued peace, harmony and progress of the town. Despite the fact that majority of its populace are either Muslims or Christians, Erinle festival remains a rallying point for the natives of Ilobu in Osun State.Tunde Busari, \\"Erinle festival: Symbol of Ilobu unity\\", Daily Newswatch, 7 December 2013 System of administration Politically, the Olobu enjoyed extensive power. He has legislative and judicial powers. He almost monopolised the right to impose or commute capital punishment and also controlled appointments to senior political offices. Though the Olobu has the right to choose his own chiefs, he is himself chosen by the kingmakers. In the palace, the Olobu has some palace officials called 'Oba ni nki o'. This is hierarchically set up with 'Baba kekere' as its leader. The 'Baba kekere' is chosen by the reigning Oba or his chiefs. The palace officials also include the palace chronicler in person of the Chief Drummer. The Olobu rules the town through a chain of the most senior chiefs. The chiefs are known as 'llu' or 'Town Representatives'. The 'llu' is headed by Bara, who is regarded as next in rank to the Olobu. The other senior chiefs are Jagun, Balogun and Bale Gbobamu (Gbobamu Chief). Women also play active roles in the traditional and political administration of llobu and are given a voice through their political representative, Iyalode, who is assisted by her Otun Iyalode and Seriki, second and third in rank respectively. Next to the llu, come the Bale (heads of households). The Bales represent their different households. They do not hold meetings together except when called together by the Olobu and his chiefs. The oldest man in the compound is usually elected as the Bale. It is required that all members of a household should be able to trace their descent from a common ancestor. The unit is strictly exogamous, and sexual relations between members are regarded as incestuous and are punishable by the gods of the community.

Sport developments Ilobu appreciate the importance of sport early. Most young and able bodies in the community are fan of sport or the other with football being the most loved sport. The town has two major football clubs - Ilobu Vipers Football Club (past winner of the state league) and Ilobu United Football Club (strong contender in the state league) Market days Olobu and Adio markets are held at five day intervals. There is also a daily night market in the town. Situated along Ilobu-Ifon Osun road, Olobu market is one of the oldest markets in Yorubaland and it comes up every three days. It is the best place to buy and sell staples and cash crops, jewellery, plantains, citrus fruit, yams, cassava, sorghum, beans, okra, peppers, and gourds. Cash crops such as cocoa, cotton, tobacco, palm oil, and palm kernels are collected and sold here. Livestock, including dwarf cattle, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, and guinea fowl, are also an important part of the town's economy. Weaving and dyeing are the prominent traditional crafts. Ilobu is connected by road to Ogbomosho and Oshogbo. Population (1995) 194,400. The market attracts a lot of people from within and outside Ilobu most especially from around the neighbouring cities, towns and villages. One of the remarkable things about Olubu market is its size. It is normally held from morning to noon. Situated along Ilobu-Ire-akari-Erin Osun road, Adio market is an everyday market in Ilobu where food stuff and other goods are sold. The market attracts a lot of people from within and outside Ilobu and it is normally held from morning to noon. Future development With the establishment of Irepodun Local Government in 1976, there is every hope that the government will come to the aid of the town and with the new sense of pride and identity which the people now posses, it is hoped that the rate of development of llobu will increase remarkably. Town planning The planning of llobu has assumed a new dimension since the establishment by law of the town planning authority. The Osun State Town Planning Authority has exerted considerable influence on the town. Places of interest Places of interest in Ilobu are the Olobu Palace Complex, the Erinle shrine and Ilobu museum situated within the palace complex. Public utilities There are tarred roads from llobu to Osogbo, about 9.5 kilometres away, and Ogbomosho 48 kilometres, and the other from llobu to Ede, 24 kilometres. The town is linked by many roads, which are tarred and motorable. It has modern buildings, electricity, pipe-borne water, post office, telephone service, radio and television.

Most commonly one or two players ‚Äì though this number may be higher in large spaces ‚Äì are selected to be the \\"bulldogs\\". The bulldogs stand in the middle of the play area. All remaining players stand at one end of the area (home). The aim of the game is to run from one end of the field of play to the other, without being caught by the bulldogs. When a player is caught, they become a bulldog themselves. The winner is the last player or players 'free'. The play area is flexible‚Äîit can be played on a street, a playground, between cloisters, in a large hall or on an area of a playing field‚Äîthough there is no set size of the pitch nor set number of players as long as there is enough space for the players to run about and enough players to have fun. It is played mainly in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Australia, the United States (as sharks and minnows), New Zealand (as bullrush or kingasini), Canada and other Commonwealth countries by children at school. Variants of the game have been recorded from the nineteenth century. It originated in the United Kingdom. The game is characterised by its physicality and is often being regarded as violent, leading it to be banned from many schools in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s due to injuries to the participants, although this trend is now being reversed. Many British schools in the 21st century still do not allow children to play it, but some schools allow children to play it as long as it is non-contact (i.e., instead of the bulldogs restraining a person to the ground to capture them, they just tap them as they would in a game of tag). Sharks and Minnows derives from a German war game called Minsk und Reich. Rules As is usual with games, the particular rules applied vary from location to location, but with the same principle. The playing area consists of a main playing area, with two 'home' areas on opposing sides (similar to the try-zone areas used in rugby or American football). The home areas are the width of the playing area and are usually marked by a line or some other marker. Each game of bulldogs consists of a sequence of rounds, and it is usual to play a number of games one after another with different bulldogs each time. The game is initiated with a single player (or sometimes two or more players) as the \\"bulldog\\" or \\"catcher\\" between the home areas and the other players together in one of the home areas. The objective for the non-bulldog players is to run from one home area to the other whilst avoiding the bulldog(s) in the middle. In the later stages of the game the bulldogs will outnumber the remaining non-bulldog players, which can make captures especially rough as many bulldogs attempt to capture individual players. =Rounds= Each round is usually initiated by the bulldog(s) chanting and goading, often naming a player to be the first to attempt the run from one home area to the other. In some versions all of the non-bulldogs rush across at once, in others this rush is triggered, either by the bulldog(s) or by the named player. Once players are out of the home area the bulldog(s) can attempt to 'catch' them; caught players become bulldogs as well. The round is then repeated in the opposite direction until all players have become bulldogs. =Capture= The method by which a runner is caught varies according to local custom. It is common for a player to be caught by the bulldog(s) either holding the non-bulldog off the ground, or by tackling the non-bulldog and holding them stationary, while the bulldog exclaims a phrase (such as \\"British bulldog; one, two, three!\\" or simply \\"British bulldog!\\"). If the non-bulldog player can escape before the phrase is complete, or if they are able to continue moving (if being held stationary is required), then they are not considered to be caught. This form of the game is sometimes known as \\"take down bulldog\\" or \\"bring down bulldog\\". Another more violent variation involves forcing the non-bulldog to surrender usually by rugby-tackling them, forcing them to the ground, holding them or otherwise causing them pain until they cannot take it and give up (either verbally or by making a gesture); sometimes the non-bulldog's fingers will have to be forced into making a gesture of surrender. A simpler alternative is for the bulldog(s) to just touch the non-bulldog(s) head or back and exclaim the appropriate phrase. Capture by tackling or lifting was popular in the twentieth century, although tackling has become more common than lifting in the modern version of the game. Earlier references to the game mention either unspecified \\"detaining\\" or touching the head. In some versions, non-bulldogs also become bulldogs if they cross a boundary equivalent to a touch-line. It can be a valid method of capture for a bulldog to force a non-bulldog over the boundary. If the non-bulldog player(s) successfully enter the opposing home area without being caught, they are considered 'safe' and may not be caught by the bulldog(s). Players are also safe while they remain in their original home area, although there are sometimes rules for how long they may remain there. =Rush= The rush (also known as the 'bullrush', 'open gates' or 'stampede') may be triggered by the bulldog or the single, named player shouting a phrase such as \\"bulldog\\" or \\"bullrush\\", or it may occur when the named player is either captured or safe in the other home area. In most versions of the game there is no named player and each non-bulldog may choose when to the attempt a run to the other home area, with the round only ending when all non-bulldogs are either safe in the opposite area or caught. The bulldog(s) may usually catch any number of players in a single rush, all of whom become bulldogs. However, in other versions only the first player caught in each round becomes a bulldog, catching other players is simply for fun and has no strategic advantage. In some versions players may not re-enter the original home area once they have left. = Winning = The aim of the game for the bulldogs is to catch all the players as quickly as possible, whilst the aim for the other players is to stay uncaught for as long as possible. The last player to be caught is usually considered the winner.  Variants  Many names are shared between recorded variants of British bulldog. = Bacca = A variant called bacca (also known as action and fox and dowdy) was played in the nineteenth century at King Edward's School, Birmingham. In this version, the home areas were either end of the cloisters. A catcher must hold another player and say the phrase \\"One, two, three, caught, tobacco\\" to capture them. The phrase was the source of the game's name. In a similarly titled version called baccare, the rush is triggered by the leader of the non-catcher players calling \\"Baccare\\" or by any of the players being tricked into saying it by the catcher(s). An example given is a catcher asking \\"What does your father smoke?\\", to which a players might answer \\"bacca\\" (as a short form of \\"tobacco\\"), thus triggering the rush. = Black Tom = In the variant black tom, from early twentieth century America, the catcher triggers the rush of players by shouting \\"Black Tom\\" three times. The catcher may attempt to trick players by shouting a false signal, such as \\"Black Tim\\" or \\"Red Tom\\"; any players who attempt to run on such a signal are automatically caught and join the catcher. = Chinese wall = Chinese wall (or hill, dill, come over the hill) is another variant, where the catcher is confined between two lines smaller than the larger field (the \\"wall\\") and players must cross the \\"wall\\" without being caught.Ministry of Education Pamphlet ‚Äì Volume 25 ‚Äì Page 83 Great Britain. Ministry of Education ‚Äì 1954 \\"All players should have a turn as catcher.

COUPLE HILL-DILL All players, chasers and runners, form groups of two, holding hands. The call is \\"Hill dill, come over the hill.\\" The game may be varied by having three or four in each group, instead of two. 2. CHINESE WALL A tagging ...\\" = Click = A variant recorded in Marlborough, Wiltshire was called click. In this game, being the catcher was known as going Click. The catcher(s) caught other players by holding them while saying the phrase \\"One, two, three, I catch thee; help me catch another.\\" If the last remaining non-catcher player successfully made the run between home areas three times without being caught, they could nominate the person to go Click in the next game; if they failed then they had to do it themselves. = Cock = A variant recorded in the late nineteenth century is cock. In this game, the catcher is known as \\"cock\\" and there is no named, single player; all the non-catcher players run from one home area to the other at once. The cock attempts to capture (or \\"croon\\" in this version) the other players by putting their hand on the non-catcher player's head. A similar game was played in Scotland called rexa-boxa-king. In this game, the catcher is called \\"king\\" or \\"queen\\" and triggers the rush with the phrase \\"rexa-boxa-king\\" or \\"rexa-boxa\\". The last player captured becomes king in the next game. = Downhill Bullrush = A tackle/restraint variant played in some suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand during the 1970s. Runners begin at the top of a steep, heavily forested hill and catchers are positioned about half-way down the hill. = Fishy fishy = A gentler variant popular in Britain is fishy fishy. The set up is the same as bulldog, with a group of runners on one side of the area and one or two catchers in the middle. The runners chant a phrase such as \\"Fishy, Fishy, may we cross your golden water?\\" or something similar. In The Midlands of England, the phrase \\"Please Mr[s] Crocodile, can we cross the water in a cup and saucer, upside down?\\" is more common; in America, children often chant \\"Oh Captain, my Captain, may we cross your ship?\\" instead. The catchers respond with a specific stipulation; \\"Only if you're wearing blue/have blonde hair/have an S in your name!\\" etc. This means the runners run across in smaller groups, instead of one large group, and the catchers only typically need to tag the runners to turn them into catchers, rather than tackle them to the ground. A variant in America similar to fishy fishy is sharks and minnows, in which the original selected player(s) are the sharks, who attempt to \\"eat\\" the minnows. Commonly used as a fun recess activity for elementary school pupils. If a \\"shark\\" tags a \\"minnow\\", they become \\"seaweed\\" and can't move from where they're tagged for the rest of the game. Another \\"sharks and minnows\\" variant is played in swimming pools. One player is selected as the \\"shark\\" and starts on the opposite side of the pool from the rest of the \\"minnows\\" (i.e. runners). In each round, the \\"minnows\\" must swim from one side of the pool to the other without being touched/tagged by the \\"shark(s)\\" while above the surface of the water. Any \\"minnows\\" who are tagged above the water's surface while crossing the pool then join the \\"shark(s)\\" for the next round. The game finishes when only one, or zero depending on local variation, \\"minnow\\" is left. = Fox and Dowdy = In nineteenth century Warwickshire, a variant called fox and dowdy (or fox-a'-dowdy) was played across a lane or similar area. In this version, the catcher catches players by holding them and reciting the phrase \\"Fox a' dowdy‚Äîcatch a candle\\". = Ghost in the Graveyard = This is a late twentieth variant shown to have developed in the high plains states a la Iowa and Minnesota. This variant is unique in that there is a singular 'home base' and the path of required travel is in a circle around some out-of-bounds object such as a pond or house. startribune.com/the- nostalgic-thrill-of-capture-the-flag-and-other-night-games/542285852/ = Hopping Jinny = In the variant called hopping jinny (also known as hop the barger, hopping caesar, hop and dodge, hoppy bowfie, cock, cockaroosha, cockarusty, cockie duntie, cock heaving, and hopping cockerels) each player must hop at all times with their arms folded across their chests. The catcher captures players by barging into them and forcing them to put their other foot down. This game has been recorded across England in the early to mid twentieth century. Another recorded hopping variant is known as hopping bases. In this version, there is an area in the centre between the two home areas called the \\"castle\\". The catcher is known as the \\"king\\" and starts in the castle; anyone caught by the King becomes one of the king's \\"soldiers\\". The non-catcher players must hop between the home areas. The king and soldiers capture other players by touching them or forcing them to put both feet down. If the king puts both feet down, they have to return to the castle before they can capture any more players. There is also a team version of hopping bases in which players split into teams and each own one of the home areas. Players who are forced to put both legs down are captured by the other side and become \\"prisoners\\". Prisoners are placed in home area of the capturing team and can be rescued by a teammate hopping across the playing area and touching them; after which both the rescuer and rescuee are allowed to walk or run back to their own home area. The team with the most prisoners wins. = King Caesar = In the variant King Caesar (also known as King Senio, rushing bases, fox and geese, and blackthorn) from the early twentieth century, the catcher(s) are known as \\"king\\" and capture the other players by tapping them on the head and saying the phrase \\"I crown thee King\\". Once a player has placed both feet outside a home area, they may not re-enter it. When the kings outnumber the other players they can approach the home area and attempt to physically pull the players out to capture them. = Octopus = A variant called octopus has been recorded in Belfast and Vancouver. In this version the catcher(s) is known as \\"seaweed\\" and, like in the game freeze tag, once caught by the first catcher, players are rooted to one spot; they then try to tag runners without moving. = Pom-pom-pullaway = A generally milder variant of British bulldog once commonly played since the 1920s in the American West and Midwest is pom- pom-pullaway (also known as pom-pom-pull-away, pom-pom-Pete-away, pump-pump- pullaway, pum-pum-pullaway, pull away, pullaway, rushing bases, crack the whip, dog and deer, and dare-goal). In this game the players start in one of the home areas, with the catcher (sometimes called the \\"stump\\" or \\"it\\" in this version) in the middle, as standard. There is no named player and the rush is triggered by the catcher calling out a phrase such as \\"pom-pom-pull-away; come away or I'll fetch you away\\", \\"pom-pom-pullaway\\", \\"pullaway\\" or something similar. Players are usually caught by being tagged or touched, although the rules differed among regional variants. The first player to be caught starts at the catcher in the next game.Pom-pom-pullaway. Dictionary of American Regional English. University of Wisconsin. Retrieved August 7, 2014.Joy Forbes. Typical Games Played In & Outside One-Room School Houses. The One Room Schoolhouse. Retrieved August 7, 2014. A variant of this game called hill dill has also been recorded. In one version the only difference is the phrase used; in this case it is \\"Hill Dill, come over the hill; or else I'll catch you standing still.\\" In another recorded version, the phrase is similarly \\"Hill Dill, come over the hill\\" but non-catchers are split equally between both home areas, so that they run in opposite directions during the rush. = Spider and Fly = Using the same concepts as British Bulldog, spider and fly's only difference is where the players yell 'Mr. Spider, Mr. Spider, may we cross your web?' before they start running for the other side. Background The game is normally played by children and offers an interesting means of letting off energy and involves rugged physical contact. It appeals to competitive spirits but at the same time produces ad-hoc team activity with all the \\"losers\\" endeavouring to bring the \\"non-losers\\" to the ground. The strongest, most athletic competitors will find it extremely difficult to win British bulldog as the number of bulldogs grows. Parents tend to deplore the game since it results in muddied and even torn clothes, bruises, bloody noses, knees and elbows and sometimes tears (when played on tarmac) but both boys and girls participate in it. As a game of physical contact that results in a m√™l√©e of people attempting to drag others down to the ground, British bulldog bears some similarity to a rugby scrum. The game when played in Australia tends to be particularly rough, with the version known as pile-ons or cocky laura being common. Controversy The physicality of the game has caused it to gain some notoriety and to be banned in a number of school playgrounds.Sarah Thomson (2000), \\"Playground or Playpound: the contested terrain of the primary playground\\", Department of Education, Keele University, cited in \\"Break with tradition\\" (), Times Educational Supplement, 22 December 2000, retrieved 19 May 2007.\\"The games children play\\", BBC News, 21 May 1999, retrieved 19 May 2007 In England and Wales, despite the Local Government Association's 2008 encouragement of traditional playground games such as British bulldog, more than a quarter of teachers surveyed in 2011 said the game had been banned at their schools. Its rough-and-tumble nature has resulted in at least one spinal injury, reported in the June 1985 British Medical Journal, and the death of an eight-year-old child in Twickenham in 2013, who collided with a player of British bulldog while playing a different game.

The couple had five sons: James (1757‚Äì1821), Winslow (1759‚Äì1791), Charles (1762‚Äì1784), Henry (1764‚Äì1828), and George (1766‚Äì1800). Mercy Warren was the daughter of James Otis Sr. and sister of Warren's firebrand lawyer friend James Otis Jr., as well as a historian, poet and playwright. She hosted political meetings in their home, and also became known for her correspondence, including with Abigail Adams, John Adams and Catherine Macauley. With her husband's support Mercy Warren, published at least two political plays, The Adulateur (in 1772) and The after the war, a volume of poetry (in 1790) and History of the American Revolution (in 1805). Political career A farmer and merchant as well as trained as a lawyer, Warren became an outspoken critic of British governmental policies following the Stamp Act of 1765. He began a twelve-year term in the lower house of the Massachusetts General Court in 1766, and was elected its speaker in 1775. Following the colony's break from Britain, in 1776 Warren was elected a member of the Provincial Congress. A member of the Sons of Liberty, Warren worked closely with his father-in-law and brother-in-law (both James Otis), and with Samuel and John Adams. Warren was more prominent in the early days of the Revolution than in the war itself. He fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill, and after Dr. Joseph Warren died in that engagement, succeeded him as President of the Provisional Congress. Warren also served as Paymaster General of the Continental Army from 1776, and on the Naval Board. He thus worked closely with George Washington throughout the conflict. Commissioned a major general in the Massachusetts militia over his wife's opposition, Warren refused to serve under Continental Army officers of lesser rank whom he had worked with as Paymaster General. Claiming illness, he refused to accept command in Rhode Island, then resigned his state commission in 1777. His duties within mostly British-occupied Massachusetts meant Warren took no part in battles after military action moved away from Boston. However, his son U.S. Navy Lieutenant James Warren Jr. lost a leg in a naval engagement. Another son, Lieutenant Winslow Warren died in the Battle of the Wabash in the Northwest Territory, the greatest defeat of the U.S. Army by Native Americans in the United States and part of the Northwest Indian War. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1780). After the Revolutionary War, Warren became controversial as an Anti-Federalist, opposing the new Constitution. Both he and Mercy submitted essays to the local newspaper as \\"Helvitius Priscus\\". Mercy Warren also wrote a pamphlet (Observations on the New Constitution) under the pen-name \\"A Columbian Patriot\\". However, their political stance put them at odds with some of Boston's mercantile elite, including Governor John Hancock (who helped Warren's opponent in an election for Lieutenant Governor), and his former ally Samuel Adams.

Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are the Bronx-Westchester County border to the north, the New England Thruway to the east, Baychester Avenue to the south, and the intersection of 233rd Street and Baychester Avenue to the west. Boston Road is the primary thoroughfare through Eastchester and Dyre Avenue is the main commercial street. Eastchester includes the sub-neighborhood of Edenwald. Eastchester is part of Bronx Community Board 12, and its ZIP Codes include 10466 and 10475. The area is patrolled by the 47th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History The neighborhood was historically heavily Ashkenazi-Jewish and Italian-American, It has the same name as a modern-day town located approximately 5 miles to the north, as the neighborhood was included in the Town of Eastchester's extent until the late 19th century upon annexation by the City of New York, its boundaries roughly matching the former Village of Eastchester, which was incorporated on March 25, 1895. The modern-day city of Mount Vernon, located right across the city line and bordering the Eastchester neighborhood, was also once part of the town. While Mount Vernon has developed along similar lines as the neighborhood of Eastchester, the modern-day Town of Eastchester (i.e. north of Mount Vernon) is markedly more affluent. 233rd Street and Boston Road are the major thoroughfares in Eastchester. Intersecting both of these streets, Dyre Avenue is the neighborhood's main commercial strip. There is also a shopping center, Shopwell Plaza (named for the former Shopwell supermarket chain) located on Boston Road next to the Boston-Secor housing project. In 2007 the city's parks department rehabilitated Seton Falls Park.New York City Parks Seton Falls Park Since the mid-20th century, the neighborhood's name began to decline in currency, meaning that in recent years residents have not really been cognizant about living in a neighborhood called \\"Eastchester.\\" This is perhaps due to confusion with Eastchester Road, a thoroughfare which runs through other parts of the Bronx, or with the Town of Eastchester in Westchester County. It is more common to hear the Eastchester neighborhood described as \\"east of White Plains Road\\", \\"south of Mount Vernon\\", \\"near Pelham\\", \\"East 233rd Street\\", etc. Land use and terrain NYCHA Edenwald Houses Eastchester is dominated by one- and two-family homes of various types, one large public housing project, and an industrial district. The total land area is roughly half a square mile. The area is low-lying and flat. The Hutchinson River runs through Eastchester, partly along the line of East 233rd Street. Bridges in Eastchester carry the New England Thruway and Boston Road over the river. A far northeastern portion of Eastchester, on the left bank of the Hutchinson River, is often confused with Pelham Manor since a nearby shopping center is located in that town. The Boston Secor Houses, comprising four buildings that are 13, 14, 17 and 18 stories tall, is located in Eastchester.NYCHA Edenwald Houses is the largest New York City Housing Authority development in the Bronx, with forty buildings, 3 or 14 stories tall, on .

These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and carrier of pheromones. They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas. The family is distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second- largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species. They belong to a lineage traditionally treated as infraorder Cicadomorpha in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, but as the latter taxon is probably not monophyletic, many modern authors prefer to abolish the Auchenorrhyncha and elevate the cicadomorphs to a suborder Clypeorrhyncha. Members of the tribe Proconiini of the subfamily Cicadellinae are commonly known as sharpshooters. Description and ecology Eurymela distincta The Cicadellidae combine the following features: * The thickened part of the antennae is very short and ends with a bristle (arista). * Two ocelli (simple eyes) are present on the top or front of the head. * The tarsi are made of three segments. * The femora are at front with, at most, weak spines. * The hind tibiae have one or more distinct keels, with a row of movable spines on each, sometimes on enlarged bases. * The base of the middle legs is close together where they originate under the thorax. * The front wings not particularly thickened. An additional and unique character of leafhoppers is the production of brochosomes, which are thought to protect the animals, and particularly their egg clutches, from predation as well as pathogens. Nymph of an unidentified Typhlocybinae species Like other Exopterygota, the leafhoppers undergo direct development from nymph to adult without a pupal stage. While many leafhoppers are drab little insects as is typical for the Membracoidea, the adults and nymphs of some species are quite colorful. Some ‚Äì in particular Stegelytrinae ‚Äì have largely translucent wings and resemble flies at a casual glance. Leafhoppers have piercing-sucking mouthparts, enabling them to feed on plant sap. A leafhoppers' diet commonly consists of sap from a wide and diverse range of plants, but some are more host-specific. Leafhoppers mainly are herbivores, but some are known to eat smaller insects, such as aphids, on occasion. A few species are known to be mud-puddling, but as it seems, females rarely engage in such behavior. Many species are also known to opportunistically pierce the human skin and draw blood but the function of such behaviour is unclear. Leafhoppers can transmit plant pathogens, such as viruses, phytoplasmas and bacteria. Cicadellidae species that are significant agricultural pests include the beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus), the maize leafhopper (Cicadulina mbila), potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae), two-spotted leafhopper (Sophonia rufofascia), blue-green sharpshooter (Graphocephala atropunctata), glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis), the common brown leafhopper (Orosius orientalis), rice green leafhoppers (Nephotettix spp.), and the white apple leafhopper (Typhlocyba pomaria). The beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus) can transmit the beet curly top virus to various members of the nightshade family, including tobacco, tomato, or eggplant, and is a serious vector of the disease in chili pepper in the Southwestern United States. In some cases, the plant pathogens distributed by leafhoppers are also pathogens of the insects themselves, and can replicate within the leafhoppers' salivary glands. Leafhoppers are also susceptible to various insect pathogens, including Dicistroviridae viruses, bacteria and fungi; numerous parasitoids attack the eggs and the adults provide food for small insectivores. Some species such as the Australian Kahaono montana even build silk nests under the leaves of trees they live in, to protect them from predators. Systematics In the now- obsolete classification that was used throughout much of the 20th century, the leafhoppers were part of the Homoptera, a paraphyletic assemblage uniting the basal lineages of Hemiptera and ranked as suborder. The splitting of the Homoptera is likely to be repeated for the Auchenorrhyncha for similar reasons, as the Auchenorrhyncha simply seem to group the moderately advanced Hemiptera, regardless of the fact the highly apomorphic Coleorrhyncha and Heteroptera (typical bugs) evolved from auchenorrhynchans. Hence, a recent trend treats the most advanced hemipterans as three or four lineages, namely Archaeorrhyncha (Fulgoromorpha if included in Auchenorrhyncha), Coleorrhyncha and Heteroptera (sometimes united as Prosorrhyncha) and Clypeorrhyncha. Within the latter, the three traditional superfamilies ‚Äì Cercopoidea (froghoppers and spittlebugs), Cicadoidea (cicadas) and Membracoidea ‚Äì appear to be monophyletic. The leafhoppers are the most basal living lineage of Membracoidea, which otherwise include the families Aetalionidae (aetalionid treehoppers), Membracidae (typical treehoppers and thorn bugs), Melizoderidae and the strange Myerslopiidae. =Subfamilies= Mating pair of Bothrogonia ferruginea (Cicadellinae), known as tsumaguro-≈çyokobai in Japan Adult Eupteryx aurata (Typhlocybinae) Aphrodes makarovi in copula (Aphrodinae) Gyponana from Arizona Jikradia olitoria (subfamily Coelidiinae) Evacanthus nigramericanus (subfamily Evacanthinae) The leafhoppers are divided into 24 subfamilies, which are listed here alphabetically, as too little is known about the family's internal phylogeny. * Aphrodinae * Bathysmatophorinae * Cicadellinae * Coelidiinae * Deltocephalinae * Errhomeninae * Euacanthellinae * Eurymelinae * Evacanthinae * Hylicinae * Iassinae * Jascopinae * Ledrinae * Megophthalminae * Mileewinae * Nastlopiinae * Neobalinae * Neocoelidiinae * Nioniinae * Phereurhininae * Portaninae * Signoretiinae * Tartessinae * Typhlocybinae * Ulopinae See also * Planthopper * Treehopper *List of animals that produce silk References Further reading *Carver, M, FG.

He first gained national attention after appearing on the television talent competition Star Search. Active as a recording artist since 1990, he has recorded a total of eight studio albums (of which the first three have been certified gold by the RIAA) and a greatest hits package which is also certified gold. His studio albums have accounted for more than 20 hit singles on the Billboard country charts, including 11 Top Ten hits. In 2000, he had a Billboard Number one as a guest artist along with Alison Krauss on Kenny Rogers' \\"Buy Me a Rose\\", and had two Number Ones on the RPM country charts in Canada. Biography Dean was born in Quincy, Florida, on April 2, 1962. His father, also known as Billy Dean, maintained a band called The Country Rocks in his spare time. By the age of eight, Dean began playing in his father's band. Throughout high school, at Robert F. Munroe Day School, he continued to play music, both in his father's band and with other local musicians. He soon began touring in local clubs, and sang Frank Sinatra's \\"My Way\\" at his high school graduation. Dean was also a basketball player in high school, and was offered a scholarship to East Central Community College in Decatur, Mississippi. He attended college for one year before dropping out in order to pursue his desired career in music. By the time he was 20, Dean made the finals on the Wrangler Country Star Search, followed by a Male Vocalist win on the television competition Star Search six years later. He also worked as a demo singer and took acting lessons, appearing in television commercials for McDonald's, Chevrolet and Valvoline. By the end of the decade, he had signed to a publishing contract with EMI Music, as well as a recording contract with SBK Records, a subsidiary of Liberty Records. Musical career =1990‚Äì1995= Dean's first single was \\"Lowdown Lonely\\", which did not enter the charts. It was followed by \\"Only Here for a Little While\\", the second release from his debut album Young Man. This song and its follow-up, \\"Somewhere in My Broken Heart\\" (previously recorded by Randy Travis on his 1989 album No Holdin' Back) were both No. 3 hits on the Billboard country charts. The latter was also a minor hit on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts. Young Man was certified gold by the RIAA. Dean's self-titled second album followed in 1991, and soon earned a gold certification as well. Four singles were released from it: \\"You Don't Count the Cost\\", \\"Only the Wind\\" and \\"Billy the Kid\\" each peaked at No. 4 on the country charts, while \\"If There Hadn't Been You\\" was a No. 3 on Billboard, and a No. 1 on both the former Radio & Records (now Mediabase) country charts in the U.S. and the RPM Country Tracks charts in Canada. Dean toured with The Judds on their farewell tour in 1991, he also toured with Wynonna Judd and Clint Black. He wrote and recorded the theme song to the ABC animated television series Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa, and hosted a Top 21 countdown on VH1. In 1992, he earned the Top New Male Vocalist award from the Academy of Country Music. Fire in the Dark was the title of Dean's third album. Issued in 1993, it was his third straight gold-certified album, earning that certification from both the RIAA and CRIA.His lead-off single \\"Tryin' to Hide a Fire in the Dark\\" peaked at No. 6 in the United States and became his second No. 1 in Canada. Following it were \\"I Wanna Take Care of You\\", \\"I'm Not Built That Way\\", and a cover of Dave Mason's 1977 pop hit \\"We Just Disagree\\". Also in 1993, Dean had an opening slot on Alan Jackson's tour. Following his first three studio albums was a greatest hits album in 1994. This album reprised his first nine singles, as well as a new song, \\"Once in a While\\", which Dean wrote and recorded for the soundtrack to the 1994 film 8 Seconds. This song peaked at No. 53 based on unsolicited airplay. Men'll Be Boys, his final release for SBK/Liberty, came later in 1994. This album was not as successful in sales or chart performance, producing the No. 24 \\"Cowboy Band\\" and No. 60 title track. After this album, Dean placed his career on hiatus to raise his children. =1996‚Äìpresent= Dean returned to the recording studio in 1996 for his fifth album, It's What I Do, on Capitol Records Nashville. This album returned him to the Top Ten with its title track and \\"That Girl's Been Spyin' on Me\\", which reached numbers 5 and 4, respectively. The final single, a cover of Don Williams' 1988 single \\"I Wouldn't Be a Man\\", fell short of Top 40. He also worked with actress and singer Crystal Bernard on her 1996 debut album Girl Next Door, in addition to co-writing its debut single \\"Have We Forgotten What Love Is.\\" Later that year, Dean released a non-charting single, \\"In the Name of Love\\", which never appeared on an album. In 1998, Victoria Shaw and several other artists, including Dean, collaborated on the charity single \\"One Heart at a Time\\". Real Man, his sixth album, was issued in mid-1998. This album produced only one Top 40 hit in its title track, followed by \\"Innocent Bystander\\" which reached number 68. After this album, Dean exited Capitol's roster. He also took up acting once more, appearing in the minor TV specials A Face to Kill For and Blue Valley Songbird. In 2000, he and Alison Krauss made guest appearances on Kenny Rogers' single \\"Buy Me a Rose\\", which reached the top of the Billboard country charts in May of that year. This song was also a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and Rogers' first number 1 single in thirteen years. A year later, Dean joined Suzy Bogguss and twelve-year-old singer Jillian Arciero (credited as Jillian) on \\"Please Keep Mom and Dad in Love,\\" which was issued on Rogers's Dreamcatcher Records, and never included on an album. Although he continued touring, he did not chart again until 2003 with \\"I'm in Love With You\\", released on the independent View 2 label. His next release for View 2 was a cover of John Denver's \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\\". Curb Records took over promotion of this single shortly after its release, and by mid-2004 it reached number 27 on the country charts. Following it was the single \\"Let Them Be Little\\", co-written by Richie McDonald of Lonestar and recorded by the band on its 2004 album Let's Be Us Again. Dean's seventh studio album, also titled Let Them Be Little, was finally issued in late 2004 on Curb. Although \\"Let Them Be Little\\" reached a peak of number 8 on the country charts in early 2005, the album's other singles all failed to reach Top 40. A Christmas music album, The Christ (A Song for Joseph), followed in late 2005. Included on the album was a duet with his daughter. In addition to recording and touring, Dean is branching into using music for corporate marketing. One of his ventures, Song Sessions, combines songwriting and corporate team building exercises. Billy has taken over the lead role (formerly played by Kenny Rogers), playing Hank Longley, in \\"The Toy Shoppe\\" (a musical written by Kenny Rogers and Kelly Junkerman) at the Starlite Theater in Branson, Missouri, through the end of 2013.

It crosses a ridge connecting Ouray, Colorado with Telluride, Colorado, and is the highest mountain pass in the San Juan Mountains, and the second highest vehicular mountain crossing in Colorado. The road is accessible by four wheel drive vehicles, and is not for the novice driver. From Ouray, the road turns off the road to Yankee Boy Basin above the Camp Bird Mine near the ghost town of Sneffels southwest of Ouray, and climbs through Imogene Basin to the summit. From Telluride, the road takes off north of downtown and climbs past the ghost town of Tomboy through Savage Basin to the summit. The first long distance alternating current power line was constructed over Imogene Pass to carry power from the Telluride area to the Camp Bird Mine. \\"Fort Peabody\\" was constructed in 1904 by a local unit of the Colorado National Guard on top of the pass to prevent union miners from crossing during a labor strike. An annual foot race is held over the pass between Ouray and Telluride on the first Saturday following Labor Day. This gruelling race starts at around 7800 ft (2377 m), is 17 miles (27.3 km) in length, and crests on the pass at 13,114 ft (3997 m), a change in elevation of just over a mile.

History Imaginism was founded in 1918 in Moscow by a group of poets including Anatoly Marienhof, Vadim Shershenevich, and Sergei Yesenin, who wanted to distance themselves from the Futurists; the name may have been influenced by imagism. Stylistically, they were heirs to Ego- Futurism. Imaginists created poetry based on sequences of arresting and uncommon images. They wrote many verbless poems.Hirsch , Edward, 'A Poet's Glossary' 2014 Other members of the group were the poets Rurik Ivnev, Alexander Kusikov, Ivan Gruzinov, Matvey Royzman, and the prominent Russian dramatist Nikolay Erdman. In January 1919 they issued a manifesto, whose text was largely written by Shershenevich. Most of the imaginists were freethinkers and atheists. Imaginism had its main centres in Moscow and St. Petersburg. There were also smaller centres of imaginism in Kazan, Saransk, and Ukraine. Imaginists organised four poetry publishing houses, one of which was called simply Imaginism, and published the poetry magazine Gostinitsa dlya puteshestvuyuschih v prekrasnom (\\"Guesthouse for travellers in the beautiful\\"). The group broke up in 1925, and in 1927 it was liquidated officially. Its heritage, though, is still strong in Russia. Poems by Yesenin and Shershenevich, memoirs by Marienhof, and plays by Erdman are still in print and always in demand. After the disappearance of the group, the \\"young imaginists\\" declared themselves followers of this trend in the early 1930s, and so did the \\"meloimaginists\\" of the 1990s.Kudryavitsky, \\"Popytka zvuka.\\"  Literature  * Markov, V.

Biography  The band was formed in November 1996 by Glenn Morten Nordb√∏, Arild Christensen and Stig Johansen. The band was initially called Purgatory but they soon decided to change their name to something less common. Anita Auglend and Ola Aarrestad joined the band shortly thereafter, and they recorded their first demo All Alone in January‚ÄìFebruary 1997. Anders Thue and Ingfrid Stensland then joined before they recorded their second demo Silent Pain in January 1998. Pete Johansen played the violin on that demo, although he did not officially join the band until the recording of their first full-length album Lake of Sorrow later in 1998. They toured across Europe, before recording their second full-length album Perpetual Desolation in 2000. During the following tour, Anita Auglend, Anders Thue and Ingfrid Stensland grew weary of traveling and left the band in 2001. A live performance was released on CD and VHS in 2001, but it was not distributed worldwide and is thus very hard to come by. The band has been dormant since the departure of its three members. Pete Johansen has since left to play the violin on several Tristania and Sirenia albums. In 2007, it was rumored that Anita Auglend had returned to the band, although these rumors were never confirmed. Despite years of a rumored reunion, Pete Johansen officially announced that they had split up in 2013. That same year, band members Anders Thue and Stig Johansen formed the band Savn with Midnattsol singer Carmen Elise Espen√¶s.. In 2016 the guitarist, composer and singer Arild Christensen forms the band RAINAREA with Nelly Khosrovyan.  Style  The Sins of Thy Beloved are often compared to gothic metal bands such as Tristania and early Theatre of Tragedy, mainly because of the band's combination of a female soprano voice with male death grunt; this trait is common to gothic metal in general, and is known as \\"beauty and the beast\\" vocals. Their music features death-doom rhythmics enhanced by the prominent use of violins, especially on the Lake of Sorrow album, typical of many gothic doom bands. Their live recordings offer a sound closer to traditional death metal than their studio albums, which make heavy use of arrangements and effects.

Origins The Imbangala were people, possibly from Central Africa, who appeared on the scene in Angola during the early 17th century. Their origins are still debated. There is general agreement that they were not the same Jagas that attacked the Kingdom of Kongo during the reign of Alvaro I. In the 1960s, it was determined that oral traditions of the Lunda Empire suggested that both groups of Jaga marauders originated in the Lunda Empire and had fled it during the 17th century. Another theory is that the Imbangala were a local people of southern Angola originating from the Bie Plateau or the coastal regions west of the highlands. The first witness account of the Imbangala, written by an English sailor named Andrew Battell, who lived with them for 16 months around 1600‚Äì1601, places them firmly in the coastal regions and highlands of modern Angola, just south of the Kwanza River. Their leaders told Battell that they had come from a place called \\"Elembe\\" and that they had originated from a \\"page\\" in its army. Battell's story was published by Samuel Purchas partially in 1614 and fully in 1625.  Initiation and customs  The Imbangala were a fully militarized society based entirely on initiation rites as opposed to the customary kinship rites of most African ethnic groups. To keep kinship from replacing initiation, all children born inside a kilombo (village) were killed. Women were allowed to leave the kilombo to have their children, but when they returned, the child was not considered an Imbangala until undergoing initiation. In almost Spartan-like program, children were trained daily in group and individual combat. During training, they wore a collar that could not be removed, even after initiation, until they had killed a man in battle. Aside from infanticide rituals, the Imbangala covered themselves with ointment called maji a samba believed to confer invulnerability as long as the soldier followed strict set of yijila (codes), which required the infanticide, cannibalism and an absolute absence of cowardice.  Weapons and tactics  Imbangala fighting men were known as nugnza (singular: gonzo) and were divided into twelve squadrons, each led by a captain called a musungo. These twelve squadrons were part of a kilombo, a temporarily-fortified town surrounded by a wooden palisade. Each kilombo had twelve gates for the twelve squadrons that formed the total fighting force. The Imbangala army took the open field or any battlefield away from their fortifications in a three-prong formation similar to the famous Zulu bull and horns formation. The Imbangala attacked with a right horn (mutanda), left horn (muya) and vanguard (muta ita) in the center. Unlike the Zulu, the Imbangala fought with the same weapons as their enemies, including bows, knives and swords. Their primary weapon was the war club or hatchet.  Relations with Portuguese  The Portuguese took an interest in the Imbangala while Battell first lived with them. Battell went to their country in company with Portuguese merchants, who were buying their war captives to sell as slaves. At the time of their contact, the Imbangala were acting as marauders whose primary interest seemed to be pillaging the country, especially to obtain large quantities of palm wine, which they produced by a wasteful method of chopping the tree down and tapping its fermented contents over a few months. The Imbangala did not permit female members to give birth, allegedly exposing all the children born in their kilombo (Portuguese quilombo), or armed camp. Instead, they replenished their numbers by capturing adolescents and forcing them to serve in their army. In methods reminiscent of modern child soldier recruitment, the young captives were often forced to kill and eat people and consume considerable alcohol and could not be admitted to full membership until they had killed an enemy in combat. Cannibalism, ritual human sacrifice and torture were all featured in what seventeenth century observers called the \\"quixilla laws\\" (from Kimbundu kixila, or prohibition) by which the Imbangala were said to live. Their military capacity and ruthlessness made them appealing to Portuguese colonists in Angola, who had been fought to a standstill in their war against the Angolan kingdom of Ndongo during the first period of colonial rule (1575‚Äì1599). Despite professed disgust at their customs, Portuguese governors of Luanda sometimes hired the Imbangala for their campaigns, beginning with Bento Banha Cardoso in 1615 but most notably following Luis Mendes de Vasconcelos's 1618 assault on Ndongo. Mendes de Vasconcelos operated with three bands of Imbangala but soon found that they were not disciplined enough to serve the Portuguese. Kasanje's band, in particular, broke free of Portuguese control and began a long campaign of pillage that eventually established them in the Baixa de Cassange region of modern Angola along the Kwango River. The band would become the modern Angolan ethnicity that calls itself Imbangala (and ceased the militant customs of its predecessors in the late 17th century). Another band, Kaza, actually joined Ndongo and opposed the Portuguese, though it would eventually betray Ndongo's Queen Njinga Mbande in 1629, thus frustrating that queen's attempt to preserve Ndongo's independence from a base on islands in the Kwanza River. After Njinga's short-lived attempt to join with Kasanje in 1629-30, she went to Matamba and there formed her own (or joined with another) Imbangala band led by a man known only as \\"Njinga Mona\\" (Njinga's son). Though reported to be an Imbangala herself (supposedly taking an initiation rite that involved pounding up a baby in a grain mortar), Njinga probably never really became one.  Later fate  Other bands were integrated into the Portuguese army serving as auxiliary soldiers, under their commanders and cantoned within the Portuguese territory. As the 17th century wore on, they and other bands were annihilated by one or another of the political states, such as the one formed by Njinga in Matamba. One rogue group of Imbangala set down roots and formed the Kasanje Kingdom. South of the Kwanza, in the original homeland of the Imbangala, they continued operating much as before for a least another half a century, but even there, they gradually formed partnerships with existing political entities such as Bihe (Viye), Huambo (Wambu) or Bailundu (Mbailundu). In all these areas, their customs tended to moderate in the 18th century, cannibalism was restricted to ritual and sometimes only to symbolic occasions (for example, in the 19th century, Imbangala groups in the central highlands still practiced a ritual known as \\"eating the old man\\").

Each curved imbrex (b) covers the side ridges of the joints formed between adjacent tegulae. Some imbrices are not shown in order to reveal the details of the tegular joints. The imbrex and tegula (plurals imbrices and tegulae) were overlapping roof tiles used in ancient Greek and Roman architecture as a waterproof and durable roof covering. They were made predominantly of fired clay, but also sometimes of marble, bronze or gilt. In Rome, they replaced wooden shingles, and were used on almost every type of structure, from humble outbuildings to grand temples and public facilities. The tegula (Greek solenes) was a plain flat tile, or a flat tile with raised edges, which was laid flat upon the roof, while the imbrex (Greek kalupter) was a semi- cylindrical roofing tile, like a half-pipe, laid over the joints between the tegulae. When well-made and properly imbricated (overlapped), there was little need for further waterproofing or sealant. The roofing area was generally surrounded by antefixae, which were often decorated and had several decorative anthemia to cover each end row imbrex. The concept of imbrex and tegula roofing in pitched roof construction is still in use today as an international feature of style and design, and is the origin of the term imbrication for the condition of things arranged in overlapping layers. History and development An example of the construct at Fishbourne Roman Palace museum Imbrices and tegulae were first made by the Greeks. Like bricks, they were formed of wet clay in a four-sided mould, often shaped with a piece of wire, and then baked in an oven or kiln. More sophisticated moulds were developed over time. Tegulae were originally made perfectly flat, or with nothing more than a ridge underneath the upper border, which allowed the tile to be \\"hung\\" upon a sloping roof so that it would not slide to the ground. Later, tegulae were formed with a raised border on the two vertical sides, which would channel rainwater to the bottom of the tile, rather than allowing it to seep between tiles to dampen the roofing materials. Another improvement occurred when these two raised borders were made to converge, forming a broad v-shaped trapezoid with the narrowest edge downwards, nestling into the widest part of the tile below it to form a continuous channel. The imbrices completed the waterproofing of the roof by arching over the joints between the vertical edges of the tegulae, dividing the roof into channels. Rain water flowed off the curved imbrices into the channels and down over the surfaces of the tegulae, and descended into the gutter (canalis). In formal architecture the canalis had a plain or ornamented frontal piece set atop the entablature, immediately above the cornice. The semicircular opening at the front of the lowermost imbrex was often capped with an ornamental fronton, and the spouts which drained the gutters were frequently decorated with lions' heads (capita leonina) or other fantastic or grotesque faces. Imbrices and tegulae are still in use in Rome in 2005. By Roman times many tiles were being made under the auspices of various Roman legions, and were imprinted with a stamp of the legion's insignia. Imbrices and tegulae are common finds in archaeological sites, and their design and markings can be of use in dating the sites and identifying the inhabitants. For instance, a 1993 archaeological dig in Merseyside in England uncovered over of tile and kiln remains. Some of the tegulae were stamped with the \\"LXXVV\\" insigniae of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Romans also often recycled broken tiles by incorporating them into mortar. Tiles of marble were first used around the year 620 BC.Pausanias, Description of Greece, v.10 ¬ß2 Besides the superior beauty and durability of the material, these tiles could be made of a much larger size than those of clay. Consequently, they were used in the construction of the greatest temples, such as the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, the Parthenon at Athens, and the Serapeum at Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli). Still more expensive and magnificent tiles were made of bronze and gilt.Pliny the Elder's Natural History, Book 33.3 ¬ß18 Gallery File:Antefix, Nordisk familjebok.pngDiagram of roofing with antefixae File:Feurs Mus√©e Tegulae Imbrices.JPGGallo-Roman tegulae and imbrices - Museum of Feurs (France) File:Tiled imbrex and tegula roof in Hainan- 02.jpgImbrex and tegula style roof tiles are also used in other parts of the world.
