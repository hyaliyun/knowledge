He was an important Chinese governmental official during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, who served as a chancellor during the three of the latter four dynasties (Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Zhou) and was also an honored official during Later Han. For his contribution to improving block-printing process for printing Chinese written works, scholars have compared him to the German inventor and blacksmith Johannes Gutenberg. Traditional histories praised him for his various virtues but also vilified him for not being faithful to a single dynasty but being willing to serve a number of successive dynasties (see Ouyang Xiu and Sima Guang below).  Background and service during Yan  Feng Dao was born in 882, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. His family was from Jingcheng (ÊôØÂüé, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). His ancestors had been alternatively farmers and scholars. Feng Dao himself was said to be virtuous and tolerant in his youth, studious and capable in writing. He did not look down on poor clothes or food, and was willing to endure hard labor to support his parents and live in poverty. At some point, he was invited by Liu Shouguang, one of the major late-Tang warlords, to serve as a secretary at the prefectural government of Liu's capital You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing). In 911, by which point Tang had fallen and Liu, having initially been a nominal vassal to the succeeding Later Liang, had declared his own state of Yan as its emperor, Feng was serving as a military advisor to Liu. That year, Liu gathered his troops and prepared to attack Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), which was ruled by its military governor Wang Chuzhi and allied with Later Liang's archenemy Jin. Feng tried to urge Liu not to attack Yiwu, arguing that the time was inopportune. This angered Liu, who threw him in prison, but he was spared his life after others interceded on his behalf. He thereafter fled to Jin, where Zhang Chengye, the chief eunuch advisor to Jin's prince Li Cunxu, recommended him to be the secretary general of Jin's capital Taiyuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268.  During Jin/Later Tang  At that time, Li Cunxu was engaged in repeated campaigns to capture territories north of the Yellow River from Later Liang, and the military matters required frequent drafting of orders, which Li entrusted to Feng Dao. In or around 919, there was an incident where Li had a dispute with his chief military advisor Guo Chongtao, after Guo had opined that Li was inviting too many officers to his meals and that the number should be reduced. In anger, Li responded, \\"Is it that we do not get to even decide how many of the people who are willing to die for us would be at our meals? Maybe the army should choose a new commander, and we will return to Taiyuan.\\" He asked Feng to draft a declaration to that effect. Feng took his pen but hesitated to write, and he responded to Li, \\"Your Royal Highness is now planning to conquer the lands south of the Yellow River and then under heavens. Guo Chongtao's request is not overly inappropriate. Even if Your Royal Highness disagreed with him, why make this dispute shock all those near and far, such that our enemies would learn this and believe that you and your subjects are discordant? This cannot be good for your reputation.\\" Soon thereafter, Guo came to apologize, and the matter came to rest.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. It was said that others became impressed with Feng's temerity in advising the prince. It was also said that Feng lived frugally during these campaigns, living in straw huts with no beds, and sharing his salaries with his staff members. Oftentimes, officers pillaged the region and took beautiful women; sometimes they would give the women to Feng as gifts. Feng would not take the women, but would instead find their families and return them to their families.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 54. In 923, Li declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong). He made Feng, along with Lu Zhi (), imperial scholars. After Emperor Zhuangzong conquered Later Liang later in the year and took its territory under his possession,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. he made Feng Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫, a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)) and deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang). When Feng's father died shortly afterwards, he left governmental service to observe a period of mourning at Jingcheng. At that time, Feng had already become well-known, and the Khitan considered raiding Jingcheng to seize him, but with the Later Tang border forces prepared, the Khitan raid did not actually occur. While he was at Jingcheng, there was a famine in the region. He distributed his wealth to aid the people around him. Also, if there were those who were neglectful in or unable to plow their fields, he would plow their fields for them. After the end of Feng's mourning period for his father ‚Äî probably in 926, based on subsequent events ‚Äî Emperor Zhuangzong summoned Feng back to the imperial government (then at Luoyang) to serve as imperial scholar again. By the time Feng reached the important city Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, in modern Kaifeng, Henan), however, the Later Tang state was in a state of confusion because of many mutinies that had risen against Emperor Zhuangzong. One of the major rebellions was led by Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan. Due to the uncertainty, Bian's defender Kong Xun urged Feng to remain at Bian Prefecture until the situation becomes clear, but Feng pointed out that he was under imperial orders to report as soon as possible, so he proceeded to Luoyang. Soon thereafter, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself, and Li Siyuan arrived at Luoyang to claim the throne (as Emperor Mingzong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Emperor Mingzong had long been respectful of Feng's capabilities and virtues. As Emperor Mingzong was himself illiterate, and his chief advisor An Chonghui, while literate, was not well- learned, An recommended setting up a system where chief scholars would advise the emperor on historical and literary matters. Emperor Mingzong thereafter established two posts for imperial scholars at Duanming Hall (), and commissioned Feng and Zhao Feng to those posts. In 927, Emperor Mingzong further made both Feng and Cui Xie chancellors, with the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), along with the title of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau). (Feng's commission was somewhat of a compromise choice by Emperor Mingzong, as the senior chancellor Ren Huan recommended Li Qi, while Kong, then one of Emperor Mingzong's chiefs of staff (Shumishi) (along with An), pushed for Cui.) While serving as chancellor, Feng often pointed out to Emperor Mingzong the difficulties that farmers faced, and Emperor Mingzong collected the poems that Feng wrote about such difficulties, often having attendants read the poems to him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Emperor Mingzong created him the Duke of Shiping. In 930, as An had long borne grudges against Emperor Mingzong's adoptive son Li Congke, who was then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), An encouraged Li Congke's subordinate Yang Yanwen () to mutiny and seize Huguo's capital Hezhong (), forcing Li Congke to return to Luoyang. An then had Feng and Zhao submit petitions asking for Li Congke to be punished, but Emperor Mingzong refused their request, as well as An's subsequent request for such punishment as well. Later in the year, when Emperor Mingzong and An had more open disputes over the handling of the rebellions by Meng Zhixiang the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and Dong Zhang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), An submitted a resignation, which many officials urged him to withdraw. Feng believed that An's best course of action at that time was to resign, and so urged the other officials not to stop An from resigning, but Zhao disagreed and was able to persuade An to remain chief of staff. (Feng turned out to be correct, as in 931, after the rift between Emperor Mingzong and An became greater, Emperor Mingzong had An demoted and then killed.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In 933, Emperor Mingzong became gravely ill. His oldest son Li Congrong, generally considered his heir presumptive, was fearful that the imperial officials would oppose his succession, and therefore decided to try to seize power by force even before Emperor Mingzong's death. Li Congrong's mutiny ended in failure, and he was killed. Some of the key officials urged for mass execution of Li Congrong's staff members, but Feng Dao and Feng Yun urged leniency, and so most of them were only exiled. Emperor MIngzong died shortly after and was succeeded by his son Li Conghou the Prince of Song (as Emperor Min).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Feng Dao continued to serve Emperor Min as chancellor. In 934, Emperor Min's then-chief advisors, Feng Yun and Zhu Hongzhao, did not want Li Congke, who was then the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and Emperor Min's brother-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan) to be entrenched in their posts, and therefore issued a series of transfer orders that, inter alia, transferred Li Congke to Hedong and Shi to Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). Li Congke considered this a trap, and therefore rebelled against Emperor Min. The imperial army sent to attack him mutinied and joined his rebellion, and he approached Luoyang. Emperor Min fled. As Li Congke was ready to enter Luoyang, Feng Dao, in an action that was criticized both at that time and in posterity, requested the official Lu Dao () to draft a petition for officials to sign, urging Li Congke to take the throne, which Lu refused to draft and rebuked Feng about. Still, subsequently, an edict was issued in the name of Emperor Mingzong's wife Empress Dowager Cao, deposing Emperor Min and making Li Congke emperor. (Emperor Min was subsequently killed in exile.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Li Congke had Feng Dao serve as the director of Emperor Mingzong's tomb. Once the tomb was completed, he sent Feng out of the capital, to serve as the military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (Âå°Âúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. While at Kuangguo's capital Tong Prefecture (), Feng's governance was said to be lenient. In 935, Li Congke recalled him from Kuangguo to serve as Sikong () ‚Äî a highly honored post as one of the Three Excellencies ‚Äî but one that lacked real authority. Indeed, as there had long not been anyone who served merely as one of the Three Excellencies without a substantive post (Feng himself had served as Sikong as well when he was chancellor earlier, as an additional title), no one in the imperial government knew what the Sikong was supposed to do. The chancellor Lu Wenji thought that the Sikong was supposed to be in charge of cleaning the altar at imperial sacrifices ‚Äî a ceremonial duty that Feng stated that he would be honored to carry out ‚Äî but soon Lu figured out that it was inappropriate to ask the highly honored Feng to actually carry out cleanings, and so did not mention that again.  During Later Jin  In 936, Shi Jingtang, who feared that Li Congke was actually planning to kill him when Li Congke ordered him transferred to Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), rebelled against Li Congke, and with aid from Khitan's Emperor Taizong, soon declared himself emperor of a new state of Later Jin (as its Emperor Gaozu), defeated Later Tang troops that Li Congke sent against him, and approached Luoyang. Li Congke committed suicide, along with his wife Empress Liu, his children, and Empress Dowager Cao. The new Later Jin emperor entered Luoyang. Later in the year, he gave Feng Dao, in addition to nonsubstantive Sikong title, the titles Tong Zhongzhu Menxia Pingzhangshi and Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)), thus making him chancellor again.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In 938, Emperor Gaozu honored the Khitan emperor to be \\"father emperor\\" while referring to himself as \\"son emperor,\\" and also offered honored titles to Emperor Taizong's mother Empress Dowager Shul√º Ping. As a sign of further respect, he sent Feng and another senior official, Liu Xu to Khitan to offer those honors, as well as gifts, to the emperor and empress dowager.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. (This mission was despite Emperor Gaozu's reservation that Emperor Taizong, impressed by Feng, might detain him. Feng pointed out that given Khitan's aid to Emperor Gaozu, he was willing to take the risk on the emperor's behalf. Emperor Taizong did consider doing so but eventually allowed Feng to return to Later Jin.) In 939, Emperor Gaozu abolished the office of Shumishi, believing that it had grown overly powerful, and gave its powers to chancellors, particularly Feng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. He was soon given the titles of Situ (Âè∏Âæí, also one of the Three Excellencies) and Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠, head of the examination bureau), and created the Duke of Lu. It was said that at one point, Feng offered to resign on account of illness, and Emperor Gaozu sent his nephew Shi Chonggui the Prince of Zheng ‚Äî the most honored male member of the imperial family at that point as Emperor Gaozu's sons, except for the young Shi Chongrui, had all been killed either in his own rebellion against Later Tang or been killed in rebellions against him ‚Äî to dissuade Feng from resigning, and further relayed, through Shi Chongrui, the comment, \\"If you do not return, I will personally come visit you.\\" It was only after this that Feng returned to the government to continue to serve as chancellor, and it was said that no one was more honored in the administration. It was said that, around this time, Feng and another chancellor, Li Song, recommended Emperor Gaozu's brother-in-law Du Chongwei, who was then the deputy commander of the imperial guards, to take over as the commander, displacing the general Liu Zhiyuan, and thus drew resentment from Liu. Because Shi Chongrui was young, Emperor Gaozu never designated him as heir. However, in 942, when Emperor Gaozu grew ill, he summoned Feng, had Shi Chongrui come out to bow to Feng, and put Shi Chongrui in Feng's lap, hinting strongly that he wanted Feng to support Shi Chongrui to succeed him. However, after Emperor Gaozu soon died, Feng discussed the matter with the imperial guard general Jing Yanguang. Feng and Jing both opined that given the perilous state that Later Jin was in at that time, an older emperor was needed. They thus supported Shi Chonggui, who then carried the title of Prince of Qi, to be emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Shi Chonggui gave Feng the honorary title of Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, also one of the Three Excellencies) and created him the Duke of Yan. Shi Chonggui, contrary to the humble posture that Emperor Gaozu took with Khitan, took a more hostile posture toward Khitan. In particular, whereas Emperor Gaozu referred to himself as \\"son\\" and \\"your subject\\" when writing Emperor Taizong, Shi Chonggui took the position advocated by Jing, that he should only refer to himself as \\"grandson\\" and not \\"your subject\\" ‚Äî in other words, leaving the personal relationship intact but at the same time disavowing that Later Jin was a vassal to Khitan. Li Song tried to argue against this stance, but with Feng not opposing or supporting it, Shi Chonggui's letter to Emperor Taizong notifying that Emperor Gaozu had died and that he had succeeded Emperor Gaozu referred to himself only as grandson. This displeased Emperor Taizong, who wrote back, rebuking Shi Chonggui for taking the throne without Khitan approval. Emperor Taizong took no hostile military action at that time, but by 944, with his general Zhao Yanshou encouraging a campaign and with Emperor Taizong promising Zhao that he would be made the emperor of the Central Plains if he succeeded, there began to be repeated Khitan incursions into Later Jin territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. With Feng considered an indecisive chancellor not willing to make decisions, Shi Chonggui sent him back to Kuangguo to serve as its military governor, carrying the Shizhong title as an honorary chancellor title. After about a year there, he was transferred to Weisheng Circuit (Â®ÅÂãù, headquartered in modern Nanyang, Henan), carrying the title of Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§, head of the legislative bureau) as an honorary chancellor title.  During Liao incursion  In 946, after defeating and then persuading Du Wei (i.e., Du Chongwei, who had removed the \\"Chong\\" character from his name to observe naming taboo), whom Shi Chonggui had commissioned as the commander of a major anti-Khitan army, to surrender, Khitan's Emperor Taizong advanced all the way south to the Later Jin capital Kaifeng, forcing Shi Chonggui to surrender.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. In 947, Emperor Taizong took the clothes of a Chinese emperor and declared himself Emperor of Liao (i.e., not using the Khitan name any more), effectively showing his intent to be the emperor of China proper as well, and summoned the Later Jin military governors to Kaifeng to meet him. Feng Dao, who was then still at Weisheng, did so. As both Zhao Yanshou and Zhang Li () had recommended Li Song, Emperor Taizong treated both Feng and Li with respect. He made Li Shumishi, while giving Feng Dao the capital of acting Taifu () and had him, while not officially be Shumishi, work out of that office and consult on important matters.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. It was said that there was a conversation where Emperor Taizong asked him, \\"How do I save all people under the heaven?\\" Feng responded, \\"At this time, not even if the Buddha reentered the world can the people be saved, but only the Emperor can save them.\\" It was believed that these words, along with the intercession of Zhao, was the reason why Emperor Taizong did not carry out mass executions of the Han people. When the Later Jin general Liu Jixun (), whom Emperor Taizong blamed for participating in Shi Chonggui's planning for the anti-Khitan campaign, Liu tried to blame Feng and Jing Yangguang for being behind the campaign; Emperor Taizong rebuked Liu for blaming Feng, and had him delivered to the northern Khitan city of Huanglong (ÈªÉÈæç, in modern Changchun, Jilin). By spring 947, however, Emperor Taizong was faced with numerous Han mutinies due to his harsh raids against the population. He decided to leave his brother-in-law Xiao Han in charge of Kaifeng while he himself took the Later Jin wealth and its key officials north, back to Liao proper. He died on the way, and the Liao generals supported his nephew Yel√º Ruan as his successor (as Emperor Shizong). Emperor Shizong, after arresting Zhao (who had wanted to take the throne himself) thereafter declared himself emperor. Meanwhile, Liu Zhiyuan, in this power vacuum, declared himself emperor of a new Later Han (as its Emperor Gaozu) and advanced south, quickly entering Kaifeng after Xiao withdrew from it, and took over most of Later Jin territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Meanwhile, Empress Dowager Shul√º opposed Emperor Shizong's ascension and sent an army against him. He defeated her army, and subsequently put her under house arrest. During the campaign, however, he left the general Yel√º Mada in charge of Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang), where Feng, along with other former Later Jin chancellors Li Song and He Ning, had remained. Yel√º Mada was corrupt and harsh, and also put the Han soldiers under severe restrictions, drawing their discontent. When Emperor Shizong subsequently sent an order for the Later Jin officials to continue to advance north to attend to Emperor Taizong's funeral, the Han soldiers mutinied under the leadership of the officer Bai Zairong (). During the battle inside Heng Prefecture, at the urging of Li Gu, Feng, Li Song, and He Ning personally went to encourage the soldiers to fight, and it was said that that raised the morale of the Han soldiers, who subsequently defeated Yel√º Mada and forced him to flee with his remaining Khitan soldiers. The soldiers subsequently offered the military governorship of the region (Chengde Circuit () to Feng, but Feng declined, pointing out that a military officer should do so, so Bai claimed the title of acting military governor, and subsequently submitted to Later Han.  During Later Han  Feng Dao, Li Song, and He Ning subsequently went to then-Later Han capital Kaifeng. Emperor Gaozu immediately commissioned Li Song and He Ning with honorary titles (albeit not substantive ones), but did not commission Feng until spring 948 (when he gave Feng the even more honored title of Taishi (), but no substantive offices). At the time of Emperor Gaozu's death in spring 948 (shortly after Feng was commissioned Taishi), Emperor Gaozu had left directions to the officials and generals he entrusted his son Liu Chengyou (Emperor Yin) to (Su Fengji, Yang Bin, Shi Hongzhao, and Guo Wei) to watch Du Chongwei (who had restored his original name after Later Jin's fall) closely, and shortly after Emperor Gaozu's death, the four, announcing the order as an order from Emperor Gaozu, had Du put to death. This caused great apprehension to Li Shouzhen, who had also become a Later Han subject. Later in spring 948, Li therefore rebelled at his post as military governor of Huguo and claimed the title of Prince of Qin, in alliance with Wang Jingchong the military governor of Fengxiang and Zhao Siwan, a rebel officer who had seized control of Jinchang Circuit (ÊôâÊòå, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). The leading officials decided to have Guo lead the imperial guard troops against Li. Before Guo departed, he went to see Feng to request Feng's opinion; Feng opined to him that since Li had long led the imperial guards that Guo would be commanding, he needed to destroy their affinity to Li by rewarding them greatly regardless of impact on the imperial treasury. Guo agreed, and it was said that this move made Guo popular among the imperial guards such that Li had no ability to sway them. Guo was thereafter able to defeat Li in 949, and Li committed suicide; Wang subsequently also did so, and Zhao, after initially surrendering to Later Han forces sent against him, reconsidered, and was then killed by Later Han troops, ending the three rebellions.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. In 950, Feng wrote an autobiographical note titled the Self-Description of the Old Man from Changle () that discussed family history and his career, including the honors that had been bestowed on him and his family members by the succeeding dynasties. (This text drew severe criticism from the later Song Dynasty historians Ouyang Xiu (the lead editor of the New History of the Five Dynasties) and Sima Guang (the lead editor of the Zizhi Tongjian), both of whom described Feng as disloyal and the most wicked among officials as a result.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 291.) In winter 950, Emperor Yin, angry that Yang, Shi, and Guo, along with the chancellor Wang Zhang, had held onto power and not let him make decisions alone, had Yang, Shi, and Wang killed. Guo, who was commanding an army to the north and not at the capital Kaifeng at that time, escaped the fate, but Emperor Yin still had his family and that of Guo's army monitor Wang Jun killed. Guo thereafter rebelled and took the army toward Kaifeng, defeating the imperial army that Emperor Yin personally commanded to face him. Emperor Yin fled and was killed in flight. When Guo subsequently entered the capital, Feng did not bow to him, but accepted his bows, stating to him calmly, \\"This trip you, Shizhong, undertook, was not an easy one.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. This apparently set back Guo's plan to take the throne himself, and Guo subsequently led the officials to greet Emperor Gaozu's wife Empress Dowager Li, who decreed that Emperor Gaozu's nephew Liu Yun, whom Emperor Gaozu had adopted as a son and who was then the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), be made emperor. She then sent Feng, along with the officials Wang Du () and Zhao Shangjiao (), to Wuning's capital Xu Prefecture () to escort Liu Yun back to the capital to take the throne. However, the officers under Guo were largely against supporting another member of the Liu family as emperor, as they were fearful of being punished for having sacked the capital. They subsequently mutinied at Chan Prefecture (Êæ∂Â∑û, in modern Puyang, Henan) and supported Guo as emperor. Guo accepted, and headed back into Kaifeng, softening Empress Dowager Li's resistance by promising to honor her like a mother, while sending his officer Guo Chongwei to intercept Liu Yun's train. When Guo Chongwei arrived, he took over Liu Yun's escorting forces and delivered Guo Wei's orders, summoning Feng back to the capital, leaving Liu Yun with Zhao and Wang, and effectively putting Liu Yun under house arrest. (Liu Yun was later killed.) In spring 951, Guo Wei took the throne as Emperor Taizu of a new Later Zhou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.  During Later Zhou  Shortly after the new Later Zhou emperor took the throne, he made Feng Dao Zhongshu Ling, thus restoring him to chancellorship. Later in the year, the general Murong Yanchao, a half brother of Later Han's Emperor Gaozu, who initially submitted to Later Zhou, rebelled at Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong). After Murong was defeated and committed suicide in early 952, Emperor Taizu considered slaughtering Murong's soldiers. However, the imperial scholar Dou Yi () met with Feng and fellow chancellor Fan Zhi and persuaded them to argue to Emperor Taizu (along with Dou himself) that the Taining soldiers were merely forced into combat by Murong. They were able to persuade Emperor Taizu, who thereafter pardoned the Taining soldiers. Later that year, another imperial scholar, Xu Taifu (), had requested that Ge Yanyu () and Li Cheng (), who had falsely accused Li Song of plotting to join Li Shouzhen's rebellion in 948 and whose false accusations led to the slaughter of Li Song and his family, be put to death. Feng opined that there had been a chance in dynasties and many general pardons in the interim, so the charges should not be pursued. However, fellow chancellor Wang Jun was impressed by Xu's fervor to avenge Li Song, and recommended Ge's and Li Cheng's death. Emperor Taizu thereafter put Ge and Li Cheng to death. In 953, believing that Wang was growing too powerful and too insolent in his behavior (including trying to prevent Emperor Taizu's adoptive son Guo Rong from coming to the capital Kaifeng to pay homage to the emperor, in fear of Guo Rong's diverting powers from him), Emperor Taizu, after consulting with Feng and the other chancellors, forced Wang into medical retirement. (After Wang's retirement and subsequent death, Guo Rong was able to stay at the capital and thereafter would remain in the power center.) Emperor Taizu died in 954 and was succeeded by Guo Rong (as Emperor Shizong). Shortly after Emperor Shizong's enthronement, even before Emperor Taizu's burial, Li Yun's biological father Liu Min (n√© Liu Chong), who had declared himself emperor and legitimate successor of the Later Han throne at Taiyuan, shortly after Emperor Taizu's proclamation of Later Zhou (and whose state, while claiming to be a continuation of Later Han, became known historically as Northern Han), decided to launch a major attack on Later Zhou with Liao support, hoping to reestablish Han control over the central plains. Emperor Shizong decided to react by personally leading an army against Liu Min. Feng and many other officials had reservations about having the new emperor personally lead the army (arguing that Emperor Shizong's absence may lead to other rebellions), which led to a heated exchange recorded by historians between Emperor Shizong and Feng: The tone of the exchange displeased Emperor Shizong, but the chancellor Wang Pu agreed with Emperor Shizong's idea of personally leading an army, and so Emperor Shizong did so anyway. As Emperor Shizong was ready to depart, he commissioned Feng to be in charge of accompanying Emperor Taizu's casket to the imperial tomb and overseeing its burial. Emperor Shizong ended up crushing the Northern Han army on the campaign, while Feng died before Emperor Shizong's victorious return.  Contribution to the development of printing  In 932, Feng Dao ordered the Confucian classics printed using movable wood blocks. About a century after the invention of block-printing, Feng Dao significantly improved the printing process, and utilized it as a political tool.Carter, Thomas Francis (1925) The Invention of Printing in China and Its Spread Westward Columbia University Press, New York, p. 26 OCLC 01747579 (The project was completed in 953, when the completed printing blocks were presented to Emperor Taizu of Later Zhou.) He is generally regarded as the inventor of modern printing in China, as Johannes Gutenberg is in the West. The first standard edition of the Confucian classics with commentary was published in 130 volumes between 932 and 953 in Xi'an. The improved printing technology quickly spread, and the earliest known Korean book was printed in 950. \\"The work of Feng Tao and his associates for printing in China may be compared to the work of Gutenberg in Europe. There had been printing before Gutenberg ‚àí block printing certainly and very likely experimentation in typography also ‚àí but Gutenberg's Bible heralded a new day in the civilization of Europe. In the same way there had been printing before Feng Tao, but it was an obscure art that had little effect on the culture of the country. Feng Tao's Classics made printing a power that ushered in the renaissance of the Sung era.\\"Carter, Thomas Francis (1925) The Invention of Printing in China and Its Spread Westward Columbia University Press, New York, p. 53 OCLC 01747579 (The version of the text that Feng used came from the text that the Tang chancellor Zheng Tan had ordered carved on stone at then-Tang capital Chang'an.)

The very gifted young Bodecker studied arts, philosophy and law at the universities of Erfurt, Leipzig and Prague and became a well known scholar and adviser to the Brandenburgian margraves. As bishop of Brandenburg he became a Prince of the Empire, thus having a very unusual career for the Middle Ages. Bishop Bodecker was a knowledgeable friend and strong defender of the discriminated Jews in Brandenburg. Furthermore, he reorganized the diocese, which was in a chaotic state when he took office. Bishop Bodecker was a member of the order of Premonstratensians. He is buried in the Cathedral of Ss. Peter and Paul in Brandenburg. References * Annette Wigger. Stephan Bodeker, O.

As a result of carbohydrate removal, lectin binding is reduced to undetectable levels, yet biotin binding affinity is retained because the carbohydrate is not necessary for this activity. Avidin has a high pI but NeutrAvidin has a near-neutral pI (pH 6.3), minimizing non- specific interactions with the negatively-charged cell surface or with DNA/RNA. Neutravidin still has lysine residues that remain available for derivatization or conjugation. Like avidin itself, NeutrAvidin is a tetramer with a strong affinity for biotin (Kd = 10‚àí15 M). In biochemical applications, streptavidin, which also binds very tightly to biotin, may be used interchangeably with NeutrAvidin. Avidin immobilized onto solid supports is also used as purification media to capture biotin-labelled protein or nucleic acid molecules. For example, cell surface proteins can be specifically labelled with membrane-impermeable biotin reagent, then specifically captured using a NeutrAvidin support.

He represented Kirkcaldy Burghs in Parliament for fifteen years, being a somewhat low-profile Member but often speaking in support of better conditions for pensioners. Origins A native of Kirkcaldy, Hubbard attended only the local elementary school before going to work as a grocer's assistant. During the First World War he enlisted in the Royal Navy, serving throughout the conflict. After the end of the war, he became a miner. He joined the Labour Party shortly after, and in 1922 married Jessie Cooper of Dysart; they had two sons. Politics Hubbard was elected to Kirkcaldy Town Council in 1936, and also served on the executive of the Fifeshire Miners' Association. In 1941 he suffered a severe leg injury at work, and retired from mining to become instead an Air-raid shelter superintendent. By-election candidate The sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkcaldy, Tom Kennedy, announced his resignation in January 1944. Hubbard was selected on 22 January to fight the seat at the resulting by-election;\\"By-Election Candidates\\", The Times, 24 January 1944. he faced opposition from Douglas Young, leader of the Scottish National Party, and a candidate standing as a 'Christian Socialist'.\\"Kirkcaldy and Attercliffe contests\\", The Times, 17 February 1944.

Located on Polish Hill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it is a prime example of the so-called 'Polish Cathedral' style of churches in both its opulence and grand scale. History Immaculate Heart of Mary was founded in 1897 as a Polish ethnic parish. Beginning in 1885, Polish immigrants began settling on Herron Hill in Pittsburgh. Eventually so many immigrants settled there that the area was renamed Polish Hill. At first, the residents attended St. Stanislaus parish in the Strip District, but by 1895, the population of Polish Hill grew to the point that a committee of local citizens petitioned the bishop for their own parish. Permission was granted and the cornerstone of a combined church, school, and convent was laid in October 1896. The completed building was dedicated in August 1897. The first floor of the building served as a school and the second floor served as the church. In 1899, the parish purchased land for a larger church. A prolific Akron, Ohio, architect William P. Ginther who specialized in ecclesiastical buildings designed the new structure, which was awarded a Pittsburgh Historic Landmark designation. The cornerstone was laid on July 31, 1904, and the completed church was dedicated on December 3, 1905. Like a number of other Polish churches in the so-called Polish Cathedral style such as St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago or St. Josaphat's Basilica in Milwaukee, the architectural plans for the church were intentionally modeled on St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This church still serves the community of Polish Hill today. This parish was the first in the United States of America to have the Divine Mercy Novena. They continue to have the novena and to have a very large celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday, the Sunday immediately after Easter Sunday.

He was born at Soultz- Haut-Rhin, then in the French department of Haut-Rhin. His real name was Goschel David Behr (or Baer); the name Carmoly, borne by his family in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, was adopted by him when quite young. He studied Hebrew and Talmud at Colmar; and, because both French and German were spoken in his native town, he became proficient in those languages. Carmoly went to Paris, and there assiduously studied the old Hebrew manuscripts in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, where he was employed. Several articles published by him on various subjects in scientific papers made him known; and on the establishment of a Jewish consistory in Belgium, he was appointed rabbi at Brussels (May 18, 1832). In this position Carmoly rendered many services to the newly founded congregation, chiefly in providing schools for the poor. Seven years later, having provoked great opposition by his new scheme of reforms, Carmoly resigned the rabbinate and retired to Frankfort, where he devoted himself wholly to Jewish literature and to the collection of Hebrew books and manuscripts, in which he was passionately interested. His grandfather was Isaachar B√§r ben Judah Carmoly, rabbi of Sulz. Works Carmoly's works have been severely attacked by the critics; and it must be admitted that his statements cannot always be relied upon. Still, he rendered many services to Jewish literature and history; and the mistrust of his works is often unfounded. Carmoly was the author of the following works: * Toledot Gedole Yisrael, a biographical dictionary of eminent Jews, ancient and modern, Metz, 1828 (only one volume, extending to \\"Aaron ben Chayyim,\\" was published) * Wessely et Ses √âcrits, Nancy, 1829 * Sibbub Rab Petachyah, the travels of Petachiah of Ratisbon, translated into French and accompanied by the Hebrew text, Paris, 1831 * Eldad ha-Dani: Relation d'Eldad le Danite, Voyageur du IXe; Si√®cle, Traduit en Fran√ßais, Suivie du Texte et de Notes, Brussels, 1834 * M√©moire sur un M√©daillon en l'Honneur de Louis-le-D√©bonnaire, ibid. 1839 * Maimonides und Seine Zeitgenossen, translated from the Hebrew into German, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1840 * Les Mille et Un Contes, R√©cits Chald√©ens, Brussels, 1842 * 'Aqtan de-Mar Ya'aqob, a kind of Midrash in six chapters on the Khazars, published for the first time from two manuscripts, ibid. 1842 * Eldad et Medad, ou le Joueur Converti, translated from Leo di Modena's work, with a biographical notice on the author, ibid. 1844 * Le Jardin Enchant√©, Contes, ibid. 1845 * Sefer ha-Kuzarim: Des Khozars au Xe; Si√®cle, Suivi d'une Lettre du Ministre d'Abd el-Rachman III. au Roi de Khozarie et la R√©ponse du Prince, ibid. 1845 * Histoire des M√©decins Juifs, Anciens et Modernes, ibid. 1844 * Halikot Eretz Yisrael: Itin√©raires de la Terre Sainte des XIIIe-XVIIe Si√®cles, translated from the Hebrew, ibid. 1847 * Dibre ha-Yamim le-Bene Yachya, genealogy and biography of the Yachya family, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1850 * Ha-'Orebim u-Bene Yonah (The Crows and the Doves), genealogy of the Rapoport family, R√∂delheim, 1861 * Imre Shefer (Words of Beauty), on Hebrew versification, by Abshalom Mizrachi (fourteenth century), with an introduction and an appendix containing literary essays and poems by the editor, Frankfort- on-the-Main, 1868 * La France Isra√©lite; M√©moire pour Servir √† l'Histoire de Notre Litt√©rature, Paris, 1858 * Mebasseret Tzion (O Zion, That Bringest Good Tidings), a collection of letters from Jerusalem on the Lost Ten Tribes, Brussels, 1841 Besides these works, Carmoly contributed to many periodicals, and edited the Revue Orientale (Brussels, 1841‚Äì46, 3 vols.), in which most of the articles were furnished by himself. The most important of these contributions, which constitute works by themselves, were: * \\"Vocabulaire de la G√©ographie Rabbinique de France\\" * \\"Essai sur l'Histoire des Juifs en Belgique\\" * \\"Mille Ans des Annales Isra√©lites d'Italie\\" * \\"De l'Etat des Isra√©lites en Pologne\\"* * \\"Des Juifs du Maroc, d'Alger, de Tunis, et de Tripoli, Depuis Leur Etablissement dans Ces Contr√©es Jusqu'√† Nos Jours\\" Carmoly has been accused of fabrications by several scholars.

Located on the Isefjord, it has a population of 5,095 (1 January 2020).BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark It is located in Odsherred municipality which is part of Region Sj√¶lland. The town is a popular seaside resort. History Historic map of Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland, c. 1900. Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland is one of the oldest market towns in Zealand, first mentioned in the last part of the 13th century, although the local church dates from the first half of the 13th century. The town was destroyed by followers of Marsk Stig in 1290, and it has since been swept by several fires. The town and surrounding land was pawned by the crown to the Diocese of Roskilde in 1370 but was redeemed by Queen Margaret I. In the Middle Ages, the town was known for its harbour and its role in herring fishing. It received a charter in 1443, after which commerce replaced fishing as the main occupation. A school teaching in Latin was established in 1590, and replaced by a school which taught in Danish by 1740. At this time, the population was a mere 350, making it one of Zealand's smallest towns. The local courthouse was erected in 1868 on Holtets Plads near the church. This building also served as a city hall and prison. It has been a protected structure since 1991 and is now the home of Restaurant Madkunsten. In 1915 the Hospital for the Insane (in Danish \\"Sindsygehospitalet\\") was opened in Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland. After changing the name several times, the final name, The Psychiatric Hospital in Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland, was given in 2000. In addition being a general Psychiatric hospital it also contains Denmark's first (founded 4 November 1915) and to date only closed psychiatric ward (Sikringen) for the criminally insane and particular dangerous psychotic patients. Psychiatric Hospital had its own Chapel and cemetery, both now part of the Nyk√∏bing Sj. Psychiatric Museum, known as \\"The Brainless Cemetery\\". The Brainless Cemetery The name \\"The Brainless Cemetery\\" (i.e., de hjernel√∏ses kirkeg√•rd) was not a name out of disrespect for the patients buried there. Between 1945 and 1982 an estimate of up to 2,000 brains were removed from patients prior to being buried in the cemetery. After the removal, the brains were sent to Psychiatric Hospital in Risskov (Aarhus, Denmark) to be used in research. The removal was done in the hospital's Chapel that also contains a room used for dissections. The removal of the brains was carried out by the nursing staff which besides their normal nursing care of psychiatric ill patients had had this additional task. During the period that the removals were carried out, relatives to the patients were not asked for permission either were they informed. Most if not all of the patients buried at the cemetery have been buried without their brains.  Culture  The local Odsherred Museum was located in Kirkestr√¶de till 2004, but has since been relocated to modern buildings near \\"Hempels Glas Museum\\" (formerly Annebjerggaard Museum), approx. 2 km south of town. The latter museum holds Northern Europe's largest privately owned collection of antique glass. A third local museum was dedicated to detective fiction and Sherlock Holmes. This is now closed. Forth, Nyk√∏bing Sj. Psychiatric Museum was established in 1988. It showcases the history of Psychiatry throughout the past 100 years. The town has a section of the regional library, Odsherreds Bibliotek. It is located in the \\"Pakhuset\\" building, which is also the venue for concerts, art exhibitions and the like. Further, the town has a soccer team, \\"Nyk√∏bing IF\\", and a stadium dimensioned for 3,500 people.  Infrastructure  Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland railway station Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland is connected with Holb√¶k and the Danish rail network by the Odsherred Line operated by the railway company Lokaltog. Nyk√∏bing Sj√¶lland railway station is the northern terminus of the Odsherred Line and functions as the principal railway station of the town, which is also served by the railway halt Nyled. Bars and restaurants Nyk√∏bing Sj is known for its bars. Specialle during in the early 2000s there were two bars or clubs, the first one located above O‚Ä≤malies Irish bar first known as Revolution, then it was renamed to What's up. What's up closed in 2012 and the club merged with the Bar underneath. To become known as Olivia's dansebar. The other place was known as Check Point Discotek. It was a classic club. During the 2000s the popular club changed over the years. Often the place who let minors in was not the popular club. O‚Ä≤malies is an Irish pub with a bar set pool table, the Danish dice game \\"snyd\\" and dart.

Career=Television Barwick scripted episodes for Anderson's Supermarionation series Thunderbirds (two out of 32 episodes), Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (21 out of 32 episodes), Joe 90 (16 out of 30 episodes) and The Secret Service (four out of 13 episodes), as well as his live-action series UFO (14 out of 26 episodes), The Protectors (ten out of 52 episodes) and Space: 1999 (two out of 48 episodes). He also contributed scripts to Anderson and Christopher Burr's Supermacromation series Terrahawks, writing under various pseudonyms for all but one episode. All of these pseudonyms ended with the suffix \\"-stein\\" in imitation of the name of the leading character, Dr Tiger Ninestein. Barwick wrote 35 of the 39 episodes of Terrahawks; \\"The Midas Touch\\", which he co-wrote with Trevor Lansdowne, is the only episode for which he used his real name. With the completion of Terrahawks, Barwick went on to script the whole of Anderson's two-part stop- motion series Dick Spanner, P.I. (for which he was credited as \\"Harry Bolt\\"). In addition to his work as scriptwriter, Barwick also served as script editor for Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and UFO. Other writing credits include The Persuaders!, The Pathfinders, The Professionals and Shadowchaser. His scriptwriting is known for its humour. He often set the events of a particular episode on the date of his birthday, 10 July. Other work Anderson and Barwick collaborated on other projects, one of which was a script treatment - ultimately rejected - for the James Bond film Moonraker. The similarities between this script and the 1979 film are limited to their shared title, with the plot of the completed film incorporating none of Barwick and Anderson's ideas. Personal life Barwick continued to work as a scriptwriter until his death of cancer in August 1993 at the age of 59. He was married to Velma Barwick with whom he had three children: Deborah, Craig and Kerry. Barwick was first married to Catherine Deirdre Power.

By October 2019, the food court only had one restaurant, which was a Chinese takeout. There was also a Chinese buffet on the lower level. The food court was located directly next to the 10-screen Regal Stadium Cinema location. Renovation and name change East Towne Mall received a major renovation by its owner Simon Property Group in 1997. The outside was left unchanged aside from a new entrance. The inside was renovated with new tile, paint, trim, and other features. The mall adopted a Tennessee mountain theme. Once the renovation was completed, the name Knoxville Center was adopted.  Closing  With the mall in decline, its owner had hopes of turning the mall into a mixed-use facility with added office space, retail, dining, and entertainment. By late 2019 this plan had failed and the mall closed completely on 31 January 2020. As of September 2020, the property ownership was reported to be divided between the corporate parents of the Dillard's and Belk stores and a pair of companies named TF Knoxville TN LLC and Millertown Pavillion LLC. Redevelopment plans In September 2020, real estate development company Hillwood Enterprises filed a rezoning request for the mall site with the intention of demolishing the mall and replacing it with an e-commerce fulfillment center for an unnamed consumer goods enterprise. The total cost of the redevelopment project was estimated as $70 million.

The Spanish Air Force is commanded by the Air Force Chief of Staff or \\"Jefe de Estado Mayor\\" (JEMA) in Madrid. The source for this article is the organization section on the website of the Spanish Air Force.  Historical background  A Government decree dated 2d October 1935 of the Spanish Republican Government that placed the Direcci√≥n General de Aeron√°utica under the authority of a specific ministry, known then as the War Ministry, Ministerio de la Guerra, instead of being under the Presidencia del Gobierno. Following that decree, the Air Force regional units became restructured in 1936. Accordingly, the Spanish Navy-based Escuadra model was replaced by Regi√≥n Militar divisions which was operative until for all of the 20th century.Ej√©rcito del Aire - 1936 Nowadays the Spanish Air Force is still under a separate ministry, the Ministerio de Defensa. After the Spanish Civil War the bulk of the Spanish Armed Forces changes were introduced within the regional structure, following which all relevant air bases would be withdrawn from Catalonia, a former key region in the development of the Aeron√°utica Militar, the Spanish Air Force in its early days. Even though before and during the Civil War important air bases had been established in or around Barcelona, like the Aviaci√≥n Naval, henceforward the whole northeastern area of Spain would be left with mere token presence of the Spanish Air Force. The situation is similar in the Basque Country as well, with the difference that there had not been any important air bases there before the conflict that shaped the present structure. While Galicia has no significant Air Force Base within its territory, it has nevertheless a very important Naval Base at Ferrol.Armada Espa√±ola - Desplieque geogr√°fico  Structure  The Air Force Chief of Staff (JEMA) commands all units of the Spanish Air Force from the headquarter in Madrid. * Air Force Chief of Staff (JEMA) ** Air Force Headquarters (CGEA) in Madrid ** Combat Air Command (MACOM) at Torrej√≥n Air Base ** General Air Command (MAGEN) in Madrid ** Canary Islands Air Command (MACAN) in Las Palmas ** Logistic Support Command (MALOG) in Madrid ** Personnel Command (MAPER) in Madrid ** Economic Affairs Directorate (DAE) in Madrid  Air Force Headquarters  The Air Force Headquarters manages the human and material resources necessary for the JEMA to exercise command over the Air Force. * Air Force Headquarters in Madrid ** Air Force Staff (EMA) ** Air Force Chief of Staff Cabinet (GABJEMA) ** Technical Services, Information Systems and Telecommunications Service (JSTCIS) ** Air Force Historical and Cultural Service (SHYCEA) *** Aeronautics and Astronautics Museum *** Aeronautical History and Culture Institute ** Air Force Legal Advice (AJA) ** Central Intervention Delegate (IDC) (Fiscal Control) ** Air Force Headquarters Support Grouping (ACGEA) *** Security Group (GRUSEG) **** Honor Guard *** Support Group (GRUAP) *** Transport Squadron (ESAUT) *** Air Force Headquarters First Aid Station *** Air Force Headquarters Pharmacy and Optrician  Combat Air Command  The Combat Air Command (MACOM) at Torrej√≥n Air Base is the operational headquarter of the Spanish Air Force and responsible for the control and defense of the Spanish airspace. * Combat Air Command at Torrej√≥n Air Base ** Combat Air Command Headquarter (CGMACOM) at Torrej√≥n Air Base *** Combat Air Command General Staff *** Air Operations Center / NATO CAOC Torrej√≥n, responsible for NATO's Integrated Air Defense System South of the Alps ** Command and Control Systems Headquarter (JSMC) at Torrej√≥n Air Base *** Central Command and Control Group (GRUCEMAC) at Torrej√≥n Air Base *** Northern Command and Control Group (GRUNOMAC) at Zaragoza Air Base *** Mobile Air Control Group (GRUMOCA) at Tablada Air Base *** Operational Air Traffic Group (GRUCAO) at Torrej√≥n Air Base *** 1st Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 1) radar station at Air Station El Frasno (Zaragoza) *** 2nd Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 2) radar station at Air Station Villatobas (Toledo) *** 3rd Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 3) radar station at Air Station Constantina (Seville) *** 4th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 4) radar station at Air Station Roses (Girona) *** 5th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 5) radar station at Air Station Aitana in Alcoy (Alicante) *** 7th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 7) radar station at Air Station Puig Major in S√≥ller (Balearic Islands) *** 9th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 9) radar station at Air Station Motril (Granada) *** 10th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 10) radar station at Air Station Barbanza in Noia (A Coru√±a) *** 11th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 11) radar station at Air Station Alcal√° de los Gazules (C√°diz) *** 12th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 12) radar station at Air Station Espinosa de los Monteros (Burgos) *** 13th Air Surveillance Squadron (EVA 13) radar station at Air Station Sierra Espu√±a in Totana (Murcia) ** Air Mobility Headquarter (JMOVA) at Zaragoza Air Base ** Special Air Operations and Personnel Recovery Headquarter (JSAO & PR) ** National Component at NATO's Tactical Leadership Programme (CN -

Design and development The ≈ªak (old-fashioned \\"student\\") was designed in the Lotnicze Warsztaty Do≈õwiadczalne (LWD, Aviation Experimental Workshops) in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, directed by Tadeusz So≈Çtyk in 1946, as one of the first Polish post-war aircraft. It was a light low-wing cantilever monoplane of a mixed construction, with a crew of two, sitting side by side, and fixed conventional landing gear. The first prototype ≈ªak-1 was first flown on March 23, 1947. It was powered by the Czechoslovak 65 hp straight engine Walter Mikron III and carried markings SP- AAC. The second prototype ≈ªak-2 was powered by the 65 hp flat engine Continental A-65 and had an open cockpit. It was flown on November 27, 1947 and carried markings SP-AAE. The design appeared successful and the Ministry of Communication ordered a series of 10 aircraft. They were to be powered by licence-built A-65 engines, but since plans of engine production were abandoned, it was decided to fit them with Walter Mikron engines. They were also fitted with a closed canopy, sliding rearwards, and named ≈ªak-3. Ten planes were built by the LWD in the end of 1948, the first of them was flown on November 8, 1948. They had markings: SP-AAS to SP-AAZ, and SP-BAA to SP- BAC. At least one (SP-AAX) had engine replaced later with 85 hp (63 kW) Cirrus F.III. They were used in the Polish regional aero clubs until 1955. On October 20, 1948 there was flown a prototype of the last variant, ≈ªak-4, meant for a glider towing. It had stronger 105 hp Walter engine and an open canopy. Since it showed unsuitable for glider towing, and old Polikarpov Po-2 appeared the better plane for this purpose, ≈ªak-4 was not built in series, and the prototype was re-fitted with a closed canopy and used as a touring plane in aero club (markings SP-BAE).

Background and family origins Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis was the son of the famous Turkish privateer and Ottoman admiral Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis, who was known as Curtogoli in Europe, particularly in Italy, France and Spain.Bono, Salvatore: Corsari nel Mediterraneo (Corsairs in the Mediterranean), Oscar Storia Mondadori. Perugia, 1993. The name Kurtoƒülu or Kurdoƒülu means Son of Kurt (Wolf) in Turkish, a patronymic epithet of Muslihiddin, derived from the name of Muslihiddin's father, Kurt Bey, a Turkish seaman from Anatolia who went to northwestern Africa for privateering together with the other famous Turkish corsairs of that period such as the Barbarossa brothers, Oru√ß Reis and Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis. Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis became a close friend of Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin, who named his son after him. Oru√ß Reis, Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis, Kemal Reis, Piri Reis and Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis often sailed together in the Mediterranean Sea. Ottoman naval expedition to Sumatra (1568‚Äì1569) In 1565, Sultan Alaaddin of Aceh declared allegiance to the Ottoman Empire and sent a request for assistance to the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (which was received by the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmet Pasha due to the absence of Suleiman who was heading for the Battle of Szigetv√°r, his final military campaign) for defending his land from Portuguese aggression. Due to Suleiman's death in 1566, the Ottoman naval expedition to Sumatra was sent by his son, Selim II, who appointed Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis with the mission. Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis was the Admiral-in-Chief of the Ottoman Indian Ocean Fleet based in Suez, with other homeports in Aden and Basra. In 1568 he set sail with a force of 22 ships carrying soldiers, military equipment and other supplies, but was prevented to cross the Indian Ocean by the campaigns in Yemen. Only some of the cannons were shipped to the Sumatran sultanate (G√∂ksoy, \\"Ottoman-Aceh relations\\", 78).

However, many of their films featured songs, and some are considered as musicals in their own right. The composer Leroy Shield scored most of Laurel and Hardy sound shorts although they were often misattributed to Marvin Hatley. Cuckoo theme The duo's \\"cuckoo\\" theme, entitled \\"Dance of The Cuckoos\\", was composed by Roach musical director Marvin Hatley as the on-the-hour chime for the Roach studio radio station. Generally known as \\"The Dance of the Cuckoos\\" it was copyrighted with the name \\"Ku Ku\\" and was first heard on the opening credits for Blotto (1930) and the Spanish version of Night Owls (1930). Laurel heard the tune on the station, and asked Hatley to use it as the Laurel and Hardy theme song. In Laurel's eyes, the song's melody represented Hardy's character (pompous and dramatic), while the harmony represented Laurel's own character (somewhat out of key, and only able to register two notes: \\"coo-coo\\"). The original theme, recorded by two clarinets in 1930, was re-recorded with a full orchestra in 1935.  Dance routines  A number of their songs are accompanied with a dance routine, the most famous of which is their dance to the song \\"At The Ball, That's All\\" sung by The Avalon Boys in Way Out West (1937). Trail of the Lonesome Pine The original cover of Trail Of The Lonesome Pine (1975) A compilation of songs from their films, called Trail of the Lonesome Pine, was released in 1975. Oliver was a trained singer and sang many of the tracks solo with Stan singing in duet occasionally. A number of the songs were sung by neither Laurel nor Hardy. The 2019 film Stan and Ollie includes the actors recreating Laurel and Hardy's routine of singing of The Trail of the Lonesome Pine as done on stage.

Wintuk played seasonally from 2007 to 2011 at the former WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden (now the Hulu Theater) entertainment complex in New York. The show ran for ten weeks each winter holiday season during the 2007 to 2011 period. Previews of Wintuk began November 1, 2007 and the world premiere and inaugural season was launched on November 7, 2007. Wintuk was a 90-minute show with a 20-minute intermission. Its initial premier season ran from November 7, 2007 to January 6, 2008. It returned for three more engagements with the final season running from November 17, 2010 through January 2, 2011. Storyline A young boy named Jamie lives in a city that has entered the season of winter. Although the season has brought ice, long shadows and intense cold, the most important arrival has not come: there is no snow. Jamie takes it on himself to try to discover what has caused this. On his quest, he interacts with a variety of characters - ranging from high- energy urban street characters, to giant dogs, to talking marionettes. He is also joined by the shy man known as Wimpy, the playful young girl known as Shadowgirl, and a lost Shaman. This adventure brings the characters to an imaginary arctic world known as Wintuk ‚Äì an environment without sunlight. Jamie and his friends find themselves surrounded by giant ice creatures and the People of the North. When the sun finally returns to Wintuk, Jamie and his friends are transported home, flying on the back of a giant crane. This generates a snowstorm, and snow finally falls on the town. Cast * Jamie: Is a bright, optimistic and open-minded young boy with a boundless sense of curiosity. Jamie has the rare ability to understand the language of the puppet lampposts and dogs in the world of Wintuk. * Shadow Girl: Is a mysterious, playful young girl who appears in the form of a shadow. She finds it quite amusing to annoy Jamie with silly games. When a sunbeam finally sets her free from her shadow, she joins Jamie on his quest to recover snow. * Wimpy: A shy young man, Wimpy is scared of many things, including his shadow. However, it is destined that he will discover his courage, and he joins Jamie on his pursuit for snow. * The Shaman: The homeless woman living in the city with her dogs is actually The Shaman. She is known to have great powers, including being able to summon the moon. After Jamie convinces the Shaman to help him in his quest, she finally reconnects with her own identity. * The People of the North: Under the eye of their High Priestess, the impervious and cold People of the North are swift and agile. They welcome the Shaman and her dogs back to their icy homeland, and also aid Jamie on his quest. * The Puppets: Throughout Wintuk, puppets are found, ranging from lampposts that help Jamie on his quest to the fantastic ice giants. Acts * Aerial straps: Two artists perform an aerial straps act. * Charivari: A group of skateboarders, inline skaters and trail bike riders take the stage, demonstrating technical twists, acrobatic turns and one-wheel spins. * Cyr wheel: Two artists (Mikalai Liubezny and Valerie Inertie) representing the People of the North spin and roll across the stage inside six-and-a-half-foot-wide metallic rings. * Hoops: With the extreme flexibility, the artist (Elena Lev) performs a hoops act, by combining contortion and hula-hooping moves. * Inner tubes: In their icy cold homeland, the People of the North make a buoyant entrance as they bounce up and down on inner tubes. * Juggling: The gigantic dogs spot a man whom they try to include into their game. The dogs bring the artist various items for him to juggle, resulting in a high-speed act. * Rola bola: In an attempt to turn a light back on, an acrobat performs a balancing act using the props his coworkers toss him‚Äîpipes, panels, boards and globes. * Rag doll: A life-size rag doll tumbles out of a strange package. A thief and a businessman fight over the seemingly lifeless toy, spinning it around and bending it into impossible positions. * Russian bars: The traditional Russian bar act (Mikalai Liubezny, Dzianis Maskalenka, Oleg Sharipov, Ruslan Coda, Darin Good, Sergei Samoded, Svetlana Suvorova, Pavlov Yurii, Dmitrii Murashev, Dmitrii Kovganov) is performed with a twist: the flyers maintain a horizontal position, rather than a standing position, while they are 'bounced' on the bars. * Slackrope: Standing on a village clothesline, an equilibrist ascends high above the stage. Supported by a half-inch rope, a series of striking moves and about-turns is performed. This act was performed by Jamie Adkins in the first three seasons and a modified version was performed by Chris Pettersen in the fourth and final season. * Swiss balls: A duo of acrobatic clowns known as \\"Les Vitamin√©s\\" springs into action to present a high-energy act in which they bounce up and down on Swiss balls like springs. Music The music of Wintuk was composed by Simon Carpentier, who also composed the music of Cirque du Soleil's 2003 production Zumanity. Cirque du Soleil released a studio album based on the show's original score on November 1, 2007.

It was built in 1962 as part of the largest building program ever at UNB which included several other residences and faculty buildings. When it was built, it was operated as an all-male residence, but from September 1991 to present, it has been a co-ed residence on the UNB Fredericton campus. The mascot for Harrison is the Husky and the house colours consist of red, and black. Residence community at UNB At UNB in 2011, there are fourteen different residence houses to choose from, each with its own character, culture, and traditions. There are one men's, two women's, nine co-ed, one apartment style, and one suite style residence. Most of the early residences have changed in format from single-gender houses to co-educational style configurations since their original construction from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Harrison changed from male residence to co-ed residence for autumn 1991. Community organization The UNB residence community is loosely based upon the Oxbridge system of separate colleges within a federalised university system. As such, Harrison is part of a larger community of residences at UNB. It is located as part of campus' central 'quad' zone. The residence community has various staff and leadership, and at the house-level, a Don -(faculty/staff or senior grad student )- who lives in the residence. The Don is assisted by floor Proctors and educational Proctors - (senior undergraduates who help the students adjust to residence and university life). UNB social life The social aspect of life in residence, and particularly in Harrison has changed substantially over the years with each subsequent time period referring to a past period as a utopia. Accurately, each change has imposed a different degree of controls on social activity. At one time, many residences operated in-house bars wherein they hosted regular parties. In later years, the bars were abolished, and the Dean of Residence office operated Campus Bar Services, a travelling bar service. Bar Services would be hired by each residence when hosting a regulated social event, of which several were permitted per term. There is now a limit of one such party per term. These limitations have been enforced to alter the image of UNB as a party-school. Also, the Liquor store on Prospect Street was named the busiest in the province, anecdotally because it was closest to UNB. Harrison House student self government The residents at Harrison elect a house committee to act as peer-leaders. The committee also works with the Residence Coordinator, Don, floor proctors (RAs), and educational proctors to coordinate house social, educational, charity, athletic activities, etc. Harrison House Presidents List 2020-2021 Cole Morash 2019-2020 Lexi Gavin 2018-2019 Louisa Gauvin 2017-2018 Holly Russell 2016-2017 Logan Blanchard 2015-2016 Dakota Van Dijk 2014-2015 Brett Pineau 2013-2014 Kyle Merritt 2012-2013 Chris Cormier/Erin Ferguson 2011-2012 Richard Sawler 2010-2011 Mark Devereux 2009-2010 Carolyn Wilson 2008-2009 Scott Carter 2007-2008 Brian Koval 2006-2007 Andrina DiFrancesco 2005-2006 Kyle Dorken 2004-2005 Kyle MacKenzie 2003-2004 Brent McCumber 2002-2003 Patrick \\"Hayseed\\" Rosebrook 2001-2002 Adam \\"Country\\" Harris 2000-2001 Erin Hardy 1998-2000 James \\"Jimbo\\" Titus 1997-1998 Andrew Dawson 1996-1997 Ryan Howard 1995-1996 Melanie Morrissey 1994-1995 Doug MacLean 1993-1994 Daniel L√©ger 1992-1993 Larry Whitman 1991-1992 Sean Daly 1990-1991 Dean Mullin 1989-1990 Ed Turpin 1968-1969 Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Hogan 1967-1968 Doug Mathews Harrison House Don List 2017 House Don System Abolished 2016-2017 Phil Taber 2013-2016 Hannah Connon 2012-2013 Bronwyn Bonney 2010-2012 Brian Beaudette 2008-2010 Krystal Ford 2007-2008 Paul Mysak 2006-2007 T.

An Associate Professor of History at UNB, he was responsible for many of the traditions and innovations within Harrison House and across the residence system as a whole. From tolerating the Pumpkin Sacrifice to introducing the student Janitorial Service, he inspired a generation of Harrisonians. Resident janitorial service For many years, Harrison has had a UNB-sponsored student run co-operative house janitorial students whose employees were house residents. The basic idea was that if the residents were able to maintain an adequate level of cleanliness, they would benefit from the income as well as gaining responsibility. The residence is one of two UNB residences that still maintains the student run Janitorial Service, also known as J-Staff. Supervisor List 2018/19 - Brandon Horvath & Kordell Walsh 2017/18 - Cabot Morgan & Amanda Short House events Harrison House maintains the longest running tradition at UNB, The Great Pumpkin Sacrifice, which began in 1973. For the event a large pumpkin is carved in the face of the Roman god Janus. One side of the face is a happy face, the other a not-so-happy one. This represents the 'academic' harvest and that some are happy with the crop reaped, while others are not. House residents decorate campus and the city with pumpkins in the lead-up to the event, and mark the coming of the event by a two-minute howl at midnight on each of the seven days prior to the event. Silence marks the daylight hours of 31 October in a mark of the solemnity of the occasion and the judgement that will come in the sacrifice. Leading up to midnight on Halloween, the Great Pumpkin is escorted by a cast of actors, wise-people, and house residents guarded by the Pumpkin's militia out of the house front doors, and across campus, blessed at the former Lady Dunn Hall courtyard (now Joy Kidd House), and returned to Harrison House where it is risen to the roof and sacrificially dropped and exploded (under the supervision of a pyro-technician). Although the event has always been prescribed to take place a midnight on Halloween, for several years in the early 2000s, the timing was adjusted to just before 10 PM, so that it would not interfere with university quiet hours. Orientation week For a few years, until the fall of 2006, Frosh Week in Harrison House included The Mr. and Mrs. Harrison contest. This was a voluntary cross-dressing pageant, in which new Harrisonians went before a panel of judges, composed of Orientation Committee members. 50th anniversary House leadership has begun planning for a 50th anniversary celebration to be held from 29 to 31 October 2011 to coincide with the 39th annual Great Pumpkin Sacrifice.

He was defeated for a third term during the Great Depression, and was succeeded by a Democrat. Born in New Brunswick, Canada, he moved to Minnesota in the United States as a young man and entered the timber industry. In 1902 he moved to Everett, Washington, where he ultimately had interests in several timber companies and a tugboat company. In 1910 he entered electoral politics, serving one term as mayor of Everett. Later he was elected to the State House, where he served one term. Early life Hartley, the eighth of twelve children, was born at Shogomoc in the British colony of New Brunswick on June 26, 1864. (It became the Province of New Brunswick after Canadian Confederation in 1867). He was the son of Rev. Edward Hartley and Rebecca Barker (Whitehead) Hartley. Hartley moved to Minnesota about 1878, joining older brothers Wilder, Benjamin, and Guilford in Brainerd, Minnesota. Career After moving to Minnesota, he worked summers on bonanza farms in Dakota Territory and winters in the logging industry. He later relocated to Minneapolis, finding work as a bookkeeper for Clough Brothers Lumber Company. In 1888, he married Nina M. Clough, daughter of David Clough, cementing his ties to Clough Brothers. The couple would have three children, Edward, David, and Mary. Hartley rose to become manager and then Vice President of Clough Brothers. His father-in-law was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1895, and in 1897 Hartley began serving as his private secretary . During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, he additionally served as the Governor's representative and staff aide to the Minnesota National Guard, acquiring the honorific title of Colonel. In 1900, David Clough moved to Everett, Washington to establish a new sawmill. Hartley, in turn, managed development of the new Cass Lake, Minnesota townsite for his older brother Guildford Hartley. Hartley rejoined his father-in-law in Everett in 1902, eventually assuming roles as either manager or owner of Hartley and Lovejoy Logging Company, the Clark-Nickerson Lumber Company, the Everett Logging Company, the Clough-Hartley Mill, and Everett City Tug Boat Company. Hartley had joined the Republican Party. He was elected mayor of Everett, Washington, serving one term from 1910 to 1912. He was next elected in 1914 to the Washington State House of Representatives, serving from 1915 to 1916. Hartley was elected, in 1925, as tenth Governor of Washington. His father-in-law David Clough arranged to have the gavel used for his swearing-in as governor of Minnesota to be the one used for the swearing-in of his son-in-law Hartley as governor in Washington. Hartley's major accomplishments during his governorship were the creation of a centralized state highway department and passage of new state timber laws. He was the first Washington Republican governor to serve two terms and to run for a third. He was succeeded by Clarence D. Martin. Death Hartley died in Seattle, Washington, on September 21, 1952. He is interred at Evergreen Cemetery (Everett, Washington).

TRIPS was a microprocessor architecture designed by a team at the University of Texas at Austin in conjunction with IBM, Intel, and Sun Microsystems. TRIPS uses an instruction set architecture designed to be easily broken down into large groups of instructions (graphs) that can be run on independent processing elements. The design collects related data into the graphs, attempting to avoid expensive data reads and writes and keeping the data in high speed memory close to the processing elements. The prototype TRIPS processor contains 16 such elements. TRIPS hoped to reach 1 TFLOP on a single processor, as papers were published from 2003 to 2006.TRIPS : One Trillion Calculations per Second by 2012 Background Computer programs consist of a series of instructions stored in memory. A processor runs a program by fetching these instructions from memory, examining them, and performing the actions the instruction calls for. In early machines, the speed of main memory was generally on the same order of time as a basic operation within the processor. For instance, an instruction that adds two numbers might take three or four instruction cycles, while fetching the numbers from memory might take one or two cycles. In these machines, there was no penalty for data being in main memory, and the instruction set architectures were generally designed to allow direct access, for instance, an add instruction might take a value from one location in memory, add it to the value from another, and then store the result in a third location. The introduction of increasingly fast microprocessors and cheap-but-slower dynamic RAM changed this equation dramatically. In modern machines, fetching a value from main memory might take the equivalent of thousands of cycles. One of the key advances in the RISC concept was to include more processor registers than earlier designs, typically several dozen rather than two or three. Instructions that formerly were provided memory locations were eliminated, replaced by ones that worked only on registers. Loading that data into the register was explicit, a separate load action had to be performed, and the results explicitly saved back. One could improve performance by eliminating as many of these memory instructions as possible. This technique quickly reached its limits, and since the 1990s modern CPUs have added increasing amounts of CPU cache to increase local storage, although cache is slower than registers. Since the late 1990s, the performance gains have mostly been made through the use of additional \\"functional units\\", which allow some instructions to run in parallel. For instance, two addition instructions working on different data can be run at the same time, effectively doubling the speed of the program. Modern CPUs generally have dozens of such units, some for integer math and boolean logic, some for floating point math, some for long-data words and others for dealing with memory and other housekeeping chores. However, most programs do not work on independent data, but instead use the outputs of one calculation as the input to another. This limits the set of instructions that can be run in parallel to some factor based on how many instructions the processor is able to examine on-the-fly. The level of instruction parallelism quickly plateaued by the mid-2000s. One attempt to break out of this limit is the very long instruction word (VLIW) concept. VLIW hands the task of looking for instruction parallelism to the compiler, removing it from the processor itself. In theory this allows the entire program to be examined for independent instructions, which can then be sent into the processor in the order that will make maximal use of the functional units. However, this has proven difficult in practice, and VLIW processors have not become widely popular. Even in the case of VLIW, another problem has grown to become an issue. In all traditional designs the data and instructions are handled by different parts of the CPU. When processing speeds were low this did not cause problems, but as performance increased, the communication times from one side of the chip (the registers) to the other (the functional units) grows to become a significant fraction of overall processing time. For further gains in performance, the registers should be distributed closer to their functional units. EDGE TRIPS is a processor based on the Explicit Data Graph Execution (EDGE) concept. EDGE attempts to bypass certain performance bottlenecks that have come to dominate modern systems.TRIPS Tutorial at ISCA 2005 EDGE is based on the processor being able to better understand the instruction stream being sent to it, not seeing it as a linear stream of individual instructions, but rather blocks of instructions related to a single task using isolated data. EDGE attempts to run all of these instructions as a block, distributing them internally along with any data they need to process.TRIPS Technical Overview The compilers examine the code and find blocks of code that share information in a specific way. These are then assembled into compiled \\"hyperblocks\\" and fed into the CPU. Since the compiler is guaranteeing that these blocks have specific interdependencies between them, the processor can isolate the code in a single functional unit with its own local memory. Consider a simple example that adds two numbers from memory, then adds that result to another value in memory. In this case a traditional processor would have to notice the dependency and schedule the instructions to run one after the other, storing the intermediate results in the registers. In an EDGE processor, the interdependencies between the data in the code would be noticed by the compiler, which would compile these instructions into a single block. That block would then be fed, along with all the data it needed to complete, into a single functional unit and its own private set of registers. This ensures that no additional memory fetching is required, as well as keeping the registers physically close to the functional unit that needs those values. Code that did not rely on this intermediate data would be compiled into separate hyperblocks. Of course its possible that an entire program would use the same data, so the compilers also look for instances where data is handed off to other code and then effectively abandoned by the original block, which is a common access pattern. In this case the compiler will still produce two separate hyperblocks, but explicitly encode the handoff of the data rather than simply leaving it stored in some shared memory location. In doing so, the processor can \\"see\\" these communications events and schedule them to run in proper order. Blocks that have considerable interdependencies are re-arranged by the compiler to spread out the communications in order to avoid bottlenecking the transport. The effect of this change is to greatly increase the isolation of the individual functional units. EDGE processors are limited in parallelism by the capabilities of the compiler, not the on-chip systems. Whereas modern processors are reaching a plateau at four-wide parallelism, EDGE designs can scale out much wider. They can also scale \\"deeper\\" as well, handing off blocks from one unit to another in a chain that is scheduled to reduce the contention due to shared values. TRIPS University of Texas at Austin's implementation of the EDGE concept is the TRIPS processor, the Tera- op, Reliable, Intelligently adaptive Processing System. A TRIPS CPU is built by repeating a single basic functional unit as many times as needed. The TRIPS design's use of hyperblocks that are loaded en-masse allows for dramatic gains in speculative execution. Whereas a traditional design might have a few hundred instructions to examine for possible scheduling into the functional units, the TRIPS design has thousands, hundreds of instructions per hyperblock, and hundreds of hyperblocks being examined. This leads to greatly improved functional unit utilization; scaling its performance to a typical four-issue superscalar design, TRIPS can process about three times as many instructions per cycle. In traditional designs there are a variety of different types of units, integer, floating point, etc., allowing more parallelism than the four-wide schedulers would otherwise allow. However, in order to keep all of the units active the instruction stream has to include all of these different types of instruction. As this is often not the case in practice, traditional CPUs often have many idle functional units. In TRIPS, the individual units are general purpose, allowing any instruction to run on any core. Not only does this avoid the need to carefully balance the number of different kinds of cores, but it also means that a TRIPS design can be built with any number of cores needed to reach a particular performance requirement. A single-core TRIPS CPU, with a simplified (or eliminated) scheduler will run a set of hyperblocks exactly like one with hundreds of cores, only slower. Better yet, the performance is not dependent on the types of data being fed in, meaning that a TRIPS CPU will run a much wider variety of tasks at the same level performance. For instance, if a traditional CPU is fed a math-heavy workload, it will bog as soon as all the floating point units are busy, with the integer units lying idle. If it is fed a data intensive program like a database job, the floating point units will lie idle while the integer units bog. In a TRIPS CPU every functional unit will add to the performance of every task, because every task can run on every unit. The designers refer to as a \\"polymorphic processor\\". TRIPS is so flexible in this regard that the developers have suggested it would even replace some custom high-speed designs like DSPs. Like TRIPS, DSPs gain additional performance by limiting data inter-dependencies, but unlike TRIPS they do so by allowing only a very limited workflow to run on them. TRIPS would be just as fast as a custom DSP on these workloads, but equally able to run other workloads at the same time. As the designers have noted, it is unlikely a TRIPS processor could be used to replace highly customized designs like GPUs in modern graphics cards, but they may be able to replace or outperform many lower-performance chips like those used for media processing. The reduction of the global register file also results in non-obvious gains. The addition of new circuitry to modern processors has meant that their overall size has remained about the same even as they move to smaller process sizes. As a result, the relative distance to the register file has grown, and this limits the possible cycle speed due to communications delays. In EDGE the data is generally more local or isolated in well defined inter-core links, eliminating large \\"cross-chip\\" delays. This means the individual cores can be run at higher speeds, limited by the signaling time of the much shorter data paths. The combination of these two design changes effects greatly improves system performance. The goal is to produce a single-processor system with 1 TFLOPs performance by 2012. However, as of 2008, GPUs from ATI and NVIDIA have already exceeded the 1 teraflop barrier (albeit for specialized applications). As for traditional CPUs, a contemporary (2007) Mac Pro using a 2-core Intel Xeon can only perform about 5 GFLOPs on single applications.Mac Pro Geekbench Score In 2003, the TRIPS team started implementing a prototype chip. Each chip has two complete cores, each one with 16 functional units in a four-wide, four-deep arrangement. In the current implementation, the compiler constructs \\"hyperblocks\\" of 128 instructions each, and allows the system to keep eight blocks \\"in flight\\" at the same time, for a total of 1,024 instructions per core. The basic design can include up to 32 chips interconnected, approaching 500 GFLOPS.TRIPS Prototype System  References  Category:Central processing unit *Instruction set Category:Instruction processing Category:Instruction set architectures ","title":"TRIPS architecture"},{"id":"10898578","text":"Kyle Zenoni (born February 16, 1984, in Hartland, Wisconsin) is a former American soccer player and current soccer coach who last played for Bolivian side La Paz F.C., after a switch from USL First Division club Minnesota Thunder.

In late 1993, Marah returned to Springfield with Josh and Shayne. In 1995, Marah was delighted to have a new mother in Josh‚Äôs fianc√©e, Annie Dutton. That same year, Marah had an appendectomy and saw a vision of Reva. Later, after Josh's and Annie's wedding, Marah was shocked to come face to face with the real Reva. Apparently, Reva had been suffering from amnesia for the past five years. Leery of getting hurt, Marah chose Annie over her own mother. When Shayne followed Marah's example, Reva promised to stay out of Marah‚Äôs life and married Buzz Cooper in March 1996. In September 1997, Marah was devastated by the death of her beloved grandfather, HB, and gave the eulogy at his funeral. By this time, Marah had lowered her defenses and let Reva, into her life again and watched happily as her parents remarried in 1999. For once, Marah finally had what she always wanted: a complete family. However, her world was shattered when she learned that Reva had another child, Jonathan, in San Cristobel while living there with amnesia. Resentful of her mother's \\"other family\\", Marah again distanced herself from Reva. Marah and Shayne went to Paris for a while and when a sixteen year old Marah returned, she came to terms with the situation. Unfortunately, Josh and Reva soon separated and, though not willing to accept her parents' separation at first, in time Marah learned to deal with it. Meanwhile, when Marah was attacked by an aggressive boy, Olivia Spencer rescued her and Marah began to confide in her. However all that changed when Olivia became the new woman in Josh's life in 2000. A resentful Marah refused to accept the situation and made no secret of her dislike of Olivia, yet all of her protests fell on deaf ears when she tried to reunite her parents. Meanwhile, a rebellious Marah was chafing under her mother‚Äôs rules and started to create bootleg CD's of concerts of the band New Ground with Susan Lemay and Sam Spencer, with help from mobster Tony Santos. The friends were finally arrested by the FBI and would have even been charged if the band hadn't have dropped the charges. About this time, Marah started dating Tony, to Sam's dismay and her parent‚Äôs disapproval. Defying her parents, Marah continued seeing Tony and the pair fell in love. When Josh and Olivia got engaged, Marah was horrified and Olivia blackmailed her with knowledge of her relationship with Tony. The day of Josh's and Olivia's wedding in January 2001, Marah disappeared, hoping to stop the wedding. Unfortunately, the wedding went on without her. When Tony discovered that Marah had used him to get back at her parents, he left her and Marah t turned to Sam. When the mafia kidnapped her, Sam and Tony joined forces to rescue Marah. Marah and Tony reunited and Tony started shedding his bad-boy image since he wanted Marah's family to approve of him. However, this \\"new and improved\\" Tony wasn't exactly who Marah wanted. When Tony refused to make love to her, claiming that they should wait longer, she got offended and broke off the relationship. Marah then began dating Sam again and, not long after, enrolled in Springfield University where her roommate was Catalina Quesada. Marah and Cat hated each other, mostly because Cat hated how Marah played Sam and Tony against each other. Though Marah tried to maintain a relationship with Sam, it was obvious that Tony was still under her skin. When she learned that it was Tony, and not Sam, who saved Josh from prison by revealing that the photo implicating him was a forgery, Marah realized she'd wronged him terribly. She left Sam and confessed to Tony she loved him but, by this time, Cat was in love with Tony and did everything in her power to hold onto him, even sending Marah's essay about virginity to the entire student body who then mocked Marah and attacked her verbally. Mortified, Marah confided in her old friend, Ben Reade, who had returned to town. Soon, the pair started dating. Unfortunately, Ben's intentions weren't pure: he was only using her to win a bet about whether he could deflower her. Though she liked Ben, Marah couldn't stop thinking about Tony. Marah's dislike of Cat intensified, in 2000, when she learned that Cat was pregnant with Tony's baby and the couple was getting married. Despite Ben's pleas to just forget about Tony, Marah couldn't and asked Tony if they could continue their friendship. Knowing he couldn't just be friends with Marah, Tony refused since he had a family to think about. Later, Marah learned a startling fact: Catalina was no longer pregnant; she miscarried her baby and kept the news from everyone! Desperate to keep Tony from marrying Cat, Marah rushed to tell him the news. Moments after the couple had said their vows, Marah burst in but before she could tell Tony the truth, Cat faked labor pains and Marah was hustled out by bodyguards. Catalina and Tony planned to go on a honeymoon to Hawaii a few days later. However, Marah refused to give up, and, one night when Tony‚Äôs grandmother, Maria, had conveniently cleared the house of all guards, arrived at the mansion. She and Catalina bitterly argued, with Marah ripping the St. Anthony's necklace off Catalina‚Äôs neck because Tony had originally planned to buy it for her. Cat ran upstairs to her room to call the police. Marah followed her, and they struggled. Cat shoved her away, then watched in disbelief as Marah hit her head on a fireplace column. When Marah awoke, Cat was dead, and Tony was telling her that he'd take care of everything. Though her father (who believed that Tony killed Cat) warned her to stay away from Tony, she insisted that he was innocent and visited an oddly silent Tony in prison. Though a small part of her believed that he may have killed Cat, Marah continued to support him, despite his efforts to push her away. Tony, on the other hand, feared that the more time Marah spent with him, the more likely it would be that the police would realize she killed Catalina (which he erroneously believed). So he pushed her away, cruelly insulting her and telling her he had killed Catalina. Around this time, Ben, in an attempt to turn over a new leaf, told Marah of the bet to take her virginity from her, and Marah threw him out of her life. Feeling disillusioned by all the men she'd let herself trust, Marah got drunk and wandered around by the docks where Tony's friend, Romeo Jones, found her. Romeo, who was obsessed with having everything Tony had, played on Marah's vulnerabilities and brought her back to Infierno with him. The next morning, Marah dreamt she had spent the night with Tony. Instead, the harsh light of day showed her that her lover was a mostly clothed, slumbering Romeo. Marah ran home and tried to shower away the memories of losing her much-cherished virtue in a drunken one-night stand to a man she had no feelings for. Unfortunately for her, Romeo visited shortly after, expecting another tryst. Marah reacted angrily until she recognized the necklace he was wearing, which was the necklace she had in her hand the night of Catalina's murder! Seeing that he must be the killer, Marah began playing a dangerous game, cozying up to him, leading him on, and building up his ego. Meanwhile, she tried to stay away from Tony, but love got the best of her, and she went into hiding with him after he escaped from jail. Romeo tracked them down at the carousel, and Marah knocked Tony out so that Romeo would take her instead. Romeo left to see Danny and Carmen about business, and when he returned, Marah got the upper hand and tried to force the truth out of him. The situation turned ugly, with Tony arriving to stop any violence, and the police arrived and arrested both men for Catalina's murder, since both accused the other of doing it. A few days later, Romeo mysteriously confessed to the murder (Carmen had made him), and Tony was cleared of all charges. He and Marah were free to be together. What kept Marah from fully sharing in the joy was the time bomb hanging over her head regarding her one-nighter with Romeo. Marah's life exploded, when Tony learned the truth from Romeo. In the back office at Infierno, Marah confirmed the news. Tony, livid, almost raped her before he stopped himself. Furious, she stripped down to her underwear, screamed at him to take her, and then ran out of the room in tears. Marah's only real source of comfort were her parents, but even this was not to last. After Richard Winslow, Marah‚Äôs Aunt Cassie‚Äôs husband, died, Reva later told Shayne and Marah that she pulled the plug on his life support system at his request. Though she explained that he had asked her to do this, Marah was unable to accept her mother's actions. As Reva was arrested for murder, Marah drew away from Reva and became very close to Cassie, because she felt that Cassie needed her more than Reva.. As summer passed, Marah began to forgive Tony for what he had done to her, since she had never stopped loving him. In late August, the pair was trapped on a fishing boat but their renewed closeness was dealt a major setback when Tony thought he saw a worker manhandling her and began beating the man up. Meanwhile, Reva pled guilty to killing Richard, in order to spare Cassie any more pain, and was sentenced to two years in prison. Marah had to basically become Reva during her absence, and during a phone call lit into Reva about how crushing her life had become. Fortunately, Reva was released and pardoned after a few weeks, and Marah went back to her old life. By now, Tony had managed to reign in his anger and expressed his genuine remorse and regret to Marah. Marah decided to forgive him and they had slowly rekindled their romance. Her family was not thrilled, especially Josh, who went out of his way to express his disgust with her decision. Though Marah stood by Tony, when Reva was harassed by a stalker, Marah mistakenly suspected Tony of the crime. However, Tony eventually earned the Lewis's trust enough to serve as Reva's bodyguard and the stalker was later revealed to be Alexandra Spaulding. In the course, of the crisis, Tony and Marah grew closer than ever and finally made love in the spring of 2003. Late that summer, Tony‚Äôs violent past came back to haunt them when Marah saw snapshots sent to Eden August showing Tony beating up a woman. Confronted with the photos, Tony told Marah it happened the previous summer after he‚Äôd attacked her. Driving for hours, Tony ended up in Chicago where he got drunk and let himself be seduced by a woman. Realizing the woman was setting him up for blackmail, Tony supposedly beat the woman to a pulp, although he had no recollection of doing so. Already on edge due to the revelation that Ben was a murderer, Marah couldn‚Äôt deal with Tony‚Äôs violent past, believing that he‚Äôd fall back into it, and she left him and moved back home. Not long after, Marah met Sandy Foster, one half of \\"Sandy and the Mole\\", the shock jocks that Marah frequently listened to on campus radio. After Marah called in the station, berating the Mole for his malicious comments about her family and friends, Sandy arrived at her door and thanked her for calling in. Upon learning that Dean Clayton Boudreau removed the disk jockey's from the air, Marah decided to stage a protest on the grounds that Sandy and the Mole had a right to speak their minds. During the protest, Marah suddenly realized that she had been unfair to Tony and asked his forgiveness. However, to her surprise, Tony refused to go back to her on the grounds that she was right about him. Confused as to why Tony was pushing her away, Marah continued her friendship with Sandy. Though she had inquired about the Mole on several occasions, Sandy always gave excuses as to why he wasn't able to help in the protests. Then one night, Marah learned Sandy's secret‚Äîthe mole was a puppet! His secret out, he confessed to her that as a child, he invented the alter ego of \\"the mole\\" as an outlet for him to talk back to his domineering father. According to him, the mole was brave and could say anything about anybody. After using the mole as a young teen to entertain his friends, eventually the routine turned into an outlet to discuss other events and led to his career as a shock jock. Understanding, Marah tried to convince him to reveal his secret, but Sandy refused stating that if he did, his credibility would be over. Willing to keep his secret, Marah soon developed feelings for Sandy. However he adamantly refused to return the affections. Later, the reason for Sandy‚Äôs reluctance was revealed‚Äîhe was Reva's son, Jonathan! Feeling betrayed, Marah turned away from Sandy and refused to accept his offers of friendship. Much later, it would be learned that Sandy was an imposter. Meanwhile, late that year, Marah found herself visited by a mysterious woman who later named herself as Carrie. Carrie had already visited Michelle Bauer and later visited Marina Cooper. After appearing to all three girls, she asked them to ask their fathers (or grandfather) about Maryanne Caruthers. Although all three girls didn't like the idea of setting up the men because of stranger, they were intrigued and asked. All the men denied knowing who Maryanne was but it was obvious that they were lying since they were visibly shaken. Carrie appeared again and told them that the town of Springfield was founded by Maryanne's grandfather, Horace Caruthers who built the town on a series of old tunnels. The Caruthers family also, with help from the Spaulding family, founded the museum where Marah lived and said that clues could be found there. The girls found a white powdery substance in the Egyptology exhibit and Carrie told the girls that this substance gave Maryanne her wealth. Maryanne's father licensed the powder to Spaulding Pharmaceuticals. Carrie, who had described Maryanne as an innocent woman, mentioned that Maryanne's fortune led to her downfall. Carrie then revealed that Maryanne's car went off a bridge and told the girls to find the vehicle. The girls figured out that the bridge must have been Cutter's Bridge and Marina secretly went to the police station to find police records to find out about the accident. Oddly, there were no records, which led the girls to conclude that Maryanne's death was covered up. Afterwards, Carrie appeared to the girls again and told them to find Maryanne's grave. Now knowing that Maryanne died in 1977, the girls proceeded to get their fathers/grandfather to open up about what they were doing in the 1970s. However, when they brought up the name Maryanne Caruthers, again the men clammed up and told the girls never to mention that name again. Though the girls were wary of hurting their fathers/grandfather by continuing on in the investigation, Carrie convinced them that it would be better if the truth were revealed. In the midst of this investigation, Marah found herself unexpectedly attracted to District Attorney Jeffrey O'Neill, a man several years her senior. Though warned to stay away from Jeffrey by her mother, Aunt Cassie, Sandy, and even Jeffrey's former girlfriend Beth Raines, Marah set her sights on seducing Jeffrey, despite (or maybe because of) his own reluctance. From Thanksgiving to New Year‚Äôs, Marah shamelessly flirted with Jeffrey. Though he tried to reject her advances, it was obvious that he found her very appealing and finally on New Year's Eve, he caved in to her advances. Meanwhile, in early 2004, Carrie finally related the tale about what happened on Oct. 17th, 1977. That night, the men spiked Maryanne's drink with a drug to loosen her up and went for a drive. Suddnely there was an accident and the car went off the bridge and into the river. Though all five men made it out of the river, Maryanne couldn't be found. Wanting to preserve their lives, Alan persuaded the others to move on with their lives and forget that they ever knew a woman named Maryanne Caruthers. After recounting the tale, Carrie told the disbelieving girls to confront their fathers/grandfather and deliver a letter to them in a pick envelope. Ed was rattled when Michelle suddenly recounted the entire story of Maryanne and handed him a pick envelope. Unnerved and agitated, Ed refused to take the letter and tore it up! Finally he became so rattled and Michelle's insistent questions that he slapped Michelle! Finally realizing that their little investigation was doing more harm than good, Michelle went to Marah and Marina and convinced them to snoop around Carrie's secret room below the museum and started looking for clues as to why exactly Carrie wanted to dredge this up. They were caught in the act and Carrie revealed the truth‚ÄîMaryanne had one surviving relative an aunt, Caroline Caruthers! Upon hearing the name they realized that Carrie was Caroline and she was the witness at the bridge who was too afraid to speak up. Not long after, each of the girls found themselves in danger. First, Michelle almost died from gas inhalation at her home. As she slipped into unconsciousness, Michelle suddenly saw Carrie who looked as if she was about to smother Michelle. Fortunately, Michelle was rescued by Danny and Bill, and Carrie claimed that she'd had been trying to save Michelle by turning off the gas valve. At almost the same time, Marah was unsettled when an old teddy bear kept cropping up despite her attempts to put it away and she found it with a razor blade, and finally Marina was caught in a cave in when she was asked by Carrie to go into the tunnels under the museum. After the incident with Marina, who was saved by Michelle and Marina, the girls finally figured out that Carrie was out for vengeance and instead of helping the men they cared about, they were only making things worse. With this realization, the girls finally stood up to Carrie and told her to leave them alone, or else. Not long after, Carrie summoned the girls to her one last time, asking them to come to the Fairgrounds for a memorial service for Maryanne. Unfortunately, Carrie's motives were far more diabolical. Unbeknownst to anyone, the rings Carrie gave the girls rings to wear that were tainted with a drug called Antimonius. Arriving at the Fairgrounds under the influence of the drug, the girls, in a fog, entered the hall of mirrors. Then came a startling turn of events: Dazed and confused the girls, wandered the hall and became aware that the men were there also. Scared and ill, the girls cried out for the men to help them. Meanwhile, Carrie finally announced her plan to the men‚Äîone of the girls would be killed in place of Maryanne; they would have to choose. Horrified by her insanity, the men realized that the girls, who seemed in a dazed state, were in the Hall of Mirrors, but had trouble locating because the mirrors kept them from seeing what was real and what wasn't. Although Ed was able to locate Marina and Michelle and lead them outside to safety, Marah remained missing for a while longer. Then came a startling chain of events. Carrie suddenly appeared brandishing a gun, poised to shoot. However, because of the mirrors no one could tell what was the real Carrie. Although Buzz got out his gun (that he brought at Alan's insistence, so that they could take care of the threat), he was caught unaware by Carrie who shot him! Then Carrie pointed her gun at Josh and was set to fire when a shot rang out, apparently killing Carrie! Shot in the back, Carrie fell through the trap door at the bottom of the Hall and her body was rushed away by the river below. Seeing a dazed Marah holding the smoking gun, Josh decided to take the blame and there and then, he and the others created an elaborate story about how he shot Carrie in self-defense. Josh went to the police and confessed to murdering Carrie, who he painted as a deranged woman angry about not getting a job, in self-defense. Shocked at her father's confession, a very confused Marah knew there was something she was forgetting but couldn't remember. Mere days later, she remembered that SHE shot and killed Carrie. Determined that her father wouldn't take the punishment for a crime she committed, Marah went to the police station and confessed. Not long after, Reva helped close the door on the entire Maryanne Caruthers situation when, using her psychic visions, she learned that not only had Carrie faked her death, but had been the one who caused Maryanne's death that fateful night in 1977 when she strangled Maryanne, who had washed ashore at the other side of the riverbank. Days later, while struggling to deal with the harrowing ordeal, Marah received fantastic news from her cousin Mindy. Apparently, Mindy showed some designers in Paris Marah's designs and one of them was interested in hiring her. Immediately, Marah's maudlin mood vanished and she became hopeful for the future again. Although, she hoped that Jeffrey would accompany her to Paris, he backed out and Marah left town to forge an exciting new career. The summer of 2006, while Marah was in New York on business, Reva arranged for a family reunion. However, conspicuous in his absence was Josh. Months later, the pair divorced. In November, Marah returned to town and arranged for both of her parents to come to Towers so they could talk. By this point, Reva finally confessed that she had been secretly battling cancer for months but was now in remission. Her secrecy, though intended to spare her family, succeeded in driving Josh into Cassie's arms. Though Marah tried to convince her parents that they could fix things and get back together like they always did, Reva and Josh didn't think their relationship could be salvaged this time. Meanwhile, days after finally meeting her kid brother, Jonathan, Marah spent a tense Thanksgiving with Cassie and Josh. Unnerved by the fact that Reva had refused to come, Marah lashed out. Though she tried to convince Josh that he should be with Reva, he merely stated that the family they were no longer existed. Days later, after saying goodbye to Reva, a regretful Marah made plans to leave. Though Reva suggested that she move back to Springfield, Marah stated that she would only return if her parents were back together. The following year, Josh finally married Cassie but both Marah and Shayne refused to attend the ceremony.

Named for Atlas (in Greek mythology, the son of the Titan Iapetus and Clymene and the brother of Prometheus), she was the second U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-231 on 3 June 1943 at Seneca, Illinois by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company; launched on 19 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Nettie Singer; named Atlas and redesignated a landing craft repair ship ARL-7 on 3 November 1943; and commissioned on 15 November 1943 for the voyage to the conversion yard. She arrived in Baltimore, Maryland on 14 December 1943; entered the Bethlehem Steel Key Highway Shipyard; and was placed out of commission for her conversion to a landing craft repair ship. Her modifications completed early in February, 1944 Atlas was recommissioned at Baltimore on 8 February 1944, Lieutenant Buell A. Nesbett in command. Service history=World War II After shakedown training along the Atlantic coast, Atlas departed Boston, Massachusetts at the end of the second week in March and steamed via Halifax, Nova Scotia to the British Isles. She arrived in Milford Haven, Wales on 29 March and remained there for two days before moving to Falmouth, England where she arrived on 1 April. She remained at Falmouth until the end of May when she proceeded to Plymouth to prepare for the invasion of Europe. Though not present for the actual assault, Atlas arrived on the scene on 8 June, two days after \\"D-Day,\\" and immediately began repairing damaged landing craft. Her crew worked about 14 hours a day returning their charges to active service while frequently fighting to fend off enemy air attacks. She served at various locations on both sides of the English Channel almost until the end of hostilities in Europe. On 16 April 1945 the ship left Plymouth to return to the United States. She entered Norfolk on 5 May to begin seven weeks of repairs in preparation for duty in the Pacific. Underway again on 22 June, the vessel transited the Panama Canal between 8-10 July and arrived in San Diego, California on the 25th. She remained there until 15 August, the day after Japan capitulated, before departing that port and heading for the Central Pacific. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, Atlas arrived at Guam in the Mariana Islands late in September and performed her repair duties there until late November. On the 27th, she shaped a course back toward Eniwetok and entered the lagoon at that atoll on 4 December 1945 for a five-month tour of repair work. At the end of April 1946, she stood out of the Eniwetok anchorage to begin the voyage back to the United States. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor en route before arriving in Astoria, Oregon on 24 May. There, she joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet though she was not officially decommissioned until 13 September 1946. Korean War Atlas remained inactive until midway through 1951 when the Fleet was expanding to meet the demand for warships caused by fighting in Korea. She was recommissioned at Astoria on 1 June 1951, Lieutenant Commander Jaroslav Kohl in command, and operated along the west coast until early November. On the 12th, the landing craft repair ship got underway for the Far East and made a stop at Pearl Harbor from 24 November to 1 December before continuing on to Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka on 21 December and, for the next nine months, repaired amphibious warfare ships and craft damaged in the Korean War. She operated primarily at Yokosuka and Sasebo but also saw service at Okinawa. On 25 September 1952, she left Yokosuka and shaped a course back to the United States. The ship stopped off at Pearl Harbor before continuing on to San Diego where she arrived on 24 October. Atlas operated along the California coast until March 1954. She stood out of San Diego on the 16th of that month for another tour of duty in the Far East, reentered Yokosuka on 15 April, and resumed repair work on American amphibious warfare ships and craft operating in the Orient. On 15 August, the vessel departed Yokosuka on her way to Indochina where the Viet Minh had recently won independence from France. With the certainty that a communist regime was to be established in the north, the United States assisted those who wished to leave the north before the communist regime took complete control. Atlas arrived in Haiphong on 28 August to provide repair services while anchored in Henrietta Pass. She also provided station ship, mail exchange and communication relay services. She got underway again on 24 September shaping a course back toward Japan. She arrived in Yokosuka on 7 October but remained there only three days before beginning her homeward voyage. Following the customary port call at Pearl Harbor, she continued on to the California coast and reached San Diego on 7 November. Operations in and out of her home port filled her time until 16 March 1955. On that day, Atlas pointed her bow westward from San Diego for the final deployment of her career. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, the landing craft repair ship entered Yokosuka on 17 April. In addition to her repair work there, she put to sea for two special operations of unspecified nature in the Okinawa area. She also made liberty calls at Beppu and Kobe in Japan as well as at Hong Kong.

He picked up many honours, including the FAI Cup in 1983‚Äì84 and was named PFAI Young Player of the Year in the same year. He played for UCD in the 1984‚Äì85 European Cup Winners' Cup narrowly being beaten by Everton in a two-legged tie as Everton went on to win the competition, with Hanrahan nearly scoring the equaliser in the second leg. Career Hanrahan came from a sporting family ‚Äì his father had played hurling for Limerick and three of his brothers (Peter, Gary and Dave) played in the League of Ireland. He played schoolboy football with local side Vereker Clements earning five schoolboy caps for Ireland and soon attracted interest from cross-channel in the shape of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this interest from Wolves, Hanrahan decided to sign for UCD where he spent four productive years. He made his League of Ireland debut on 10 September 1981 at Dundalk F.C. The highlight of his time at Belfield was the 1983‚Äì84 season where he picked up an FAI Cup winners medal, scoring \\"after a mazy dribble\\" in the replay as UCD beat Shamrock Rovers 2‚Äì1.The Irish Times His form was noticed by his fellow professionals and he was voted PFAI Young Player of the Year.

The FAI Cup win qualified UCD for the 1985 Cup Winners' Cup. Drawn against English club Everton in the first round, The Times' match preview picked out Hanrahan as a player to watch.

It was later included on the American release of their 1965 album Out of Our Heads. Composition and recording \\"Play with Fire\\" is credited to Nanker Phelge, a pseudonym used when tracks were composed by the entire band, even though lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards are the only Rolling Stones to appear on the track. The song was recorded late one night in January 1965 while the Stones were in Los Angeles recording with Phil Spector at the RCA Studios. Richards performed the song's acoustic guitar opening while Jagger handled vocals and tambourine (enhanced using an echo chamber). Spector played bass (actually a tuned-down electric guitar), and Jack Nitzsche provided the song's distinctive harpsichord arrangement and tamtams. The Stones left for a tour of Australia the following day.\\"Play With Fire\\". Time Is On Our Side. 2007 (accessed 8 May 2007). The song's lyrics talk of the singer's relationship with a high society girl, disparaging the lifestyle much in the same way that \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\" would in a more up-tempo feel. The title refers to the idiom \\"If you play with fire, you will get burned.\\" In a 1995 interview with Jann Wenner for Rolling Stone, entitled \\"Jagger Remembers,\\" Jagger said, \\"'Play with Fire' sounds amazing‚Äîwhen I heard it last.

According to Richie Unterberger, a friend of the Stones wrote that an unreleased version of the song, entitled \\"Mess with Fire\\", was also recorded, featuring a much more upbeat, soul-oriented feel. However, the story is considered dubious by Unterberger.[ Unterberger, Richie \\"Play With Fire\\"]. AllMusic accessed 8 May 2007).

He was the founder of the Roure Perfumery School and served as its first director in 1946. Jean Carles was also the mentor of many perfumers including Monique Schlienger and Jacques Polge. Despite becoming anosmic towards the end of his life, Carles created works such as Ma Griffe (Carven) and Miss Dior (Christian Dior) using only his memory of odours to guide him. His condition was only known to his son, who assisted Jean by smelling and commenting on his creations. Due to this remarkable feat, Jean Carles is often compared to Beethoven who continued to compose music after becoming profoundly deaf. Training technique Carles also devised a training technique bearing his name (Jean Carles Method) for learning about natural and synthetic perfumery materials. Sixty of these odourants are arranged in a table format, which is organised by classes. Students first learn the contrasts between classes of odourants; floral, woody etc which are arranged in columns. They then proceed to compare and contrast the materials within each class, which are set out in rows. For example, in the floral column there will be rose, jasmine etc, and in the row for rose, its constituents such as phenyl ethyl alcohol, geraniol etc will be listed. This is the most well known technique for memorising and understanding perfumery materials. It and its variants are still widely used to train novice perfumers. Method of Composition Jean Carles was the first to set about composing perfumes on a rational basis. Instead of the trial and error method he had observed as a student,he conducted many trials with pairs of materials to see how they would combine. Carles carried out numerous trials with oakmoss for example, combining it with different materials and in different ratios. This might involve, say, oak moss and patchouli mixed in the ratios of 1 oakmoss to 9 patchouli, 2 moss to 8 patchouli, 3 to 7 etc right up to 9 moss and 1 patchouli. One of the blends, say 3/7 oakmoss to patchouli, would be selected to form the basis of another series of experiments, which might be with vetiver for example. In this way a perfume would be composed in increments, and not all at once on a haphazard basis, as was often the way at the time. The relative volatility of perfumery materials was also investigated by Carles, and this allowed him to refine his method of perfume composition by building a structure from the bottom up. First the base notes are blended, and then the process continues through the middle notes to the most volatile and fleeting top notes which are found at the head of a perfume, and which are the ones immediately smelled when a perfume is first sprayed.

Literally meaning gnosis, ginans are the sacred literature of the Nizari Ismailis of South Asia, spanning topics of divine love, cosmology, rituals, eschatology, ethical behavior and meditation. Ranging from three verses to hundreds of pages, ginans are attributed to the Pirs, who were second only to the Imams in the Ismaili hierarchy. Virani, Shafique N. ‚ÄúSymphony of Gnosis: A Self-Definition of the Ismaili GinƒÅn Literature.‚Äù Chap. 55. In Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought. Edited by Todd Lawson, 503-521. London: I.B. Tauris in association with Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2005. www.academia.edu/36984287/Symphony_of_Gnosis_A_SelfDefinition_of_the_Ismaili_Ginan_Literature It was originally an oral rendition mostly by Pirs, first among whom to come to South Asia was Pir Satgurnoor in the 12th century. Ginans are composed in many languages of South Asia, especially Gujarati, Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Burushaski and many more. They are based on Verses from the Quran. Like Ginans, Qaseedas are recited in Arabic, Persian or Tajik by Ismailis in Central Asia, Iran and Syria. Ismailis from the subcontinent recite these as well as Arabic and Persian qasidas which are recited before or after the prayer in the Jamatkhana. Ginan Central is a web portal developed at the University of Saskatchewan Library to safeguard ginans and promote research and education. Ginans are devotional hymns recited by the Nizari Ismaili communities in South Asia. The recitation of ginans is not restricted to just Nizari Ismailis evidenced by the recitation of ginans by many established non- Nizari Ismaili singers such as Abida Parveen who recited the ginan Ya Ali Khub Majalis in the presence of the 49th present and living Imam of the Nizari Ismailis, His Highness Prince Aga Khan IV, the accessibility to view current transcripts and translations of ginans, and the academic literature written on ginans which is made accessible to the larger public. Although ginans can be recited, studied, and listened to by non-Nizari Ismailis, ginans hold a special role in the cultural practice and rituals of Nizari Ismailis, specifically the community of Khojas, a caste of South Asians of whom the majority now identify as Nizari Ismaili. The Khojas, contextualized by the history of these Ismaili Pirs and Sayyids, came to follow the Satpanthi tradition; Satpanthi means the ‚Äútrue path‚Äù. History Ginan attributed to Pir Shams from Mahan. Recited in Jamatkhanas throughout the world, ginans were preached by Ismaili Pirs and Sayyids in the South Asian region. The ginans are a unique as literature because while they were meant to spread the Ismaili doctrine and basic theological principles to South Asians, they incorporated local elements of the region which inadvertently included what we now label as Hindu references. Perhaps the clearest connection to ginans and what we now conceive of as Hindu tradition is the theme of Kalki which is the tenth incarnation of Vishnu (Dasa Avatara). In ginan literature, the first Shia Imam, Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, is likened to this tenth incarnation which is re-labeled as Nakalanki. It is because of these pluralistic elements in the ginans that Khojas identified neither as Hindu nor as Muslim which lead to complications as the modern conception of religion created rigid boundaries of these religious identities. For centuries, this tradition of Ginans was skillfully copied by hand and memorized by members of the Ismaili jama‚Äôat, as this practice was passed from generation to generation. The melodious rhyme and rhythm, expressive lyrics, and pleasance of the Ginans is experienced and felt by those who recite and listen to the touching verses. Ismailis view ginans as a means through which to understand the message of the Qur‚Äôan and get closer to the essence of the Divine light. Therefore, even though Ginans are often an outwardly practice of the faith (zahir), they provide the vessel through which the inner meaning of the faith (batin) can be understood. Some ginans are also written in the style of the virahini; that is in the perspective of a woman who is waiting with desire to be meet and be united with her Beloved who is a metaphor for God. There are many important figures in the tradition of Ginans. These include Pir Shams, Pir Sadr al-Din, Pir Hasan al- Kabir Din, Nur Muhammad Shah, Imam Begum Shah, etc. These individuals wrote and actively contributed to the Ginan tradition. While the message and text of Ginans remains important, important academic has been done to demonstrate that just as the text, theological importance, and ritualistic practice is important to ginans, the musicality and performance level of ginans as a rite in Jamatkhanas is significant as well. Example translation of a Ginan Sahebaji tun more man bhave: Verses I-VIII God, My heart is fond of you. I think of no-one else. None else pleases my heart. Oh my lord, My heart is fond of you. So readily, my lord, You give me Whatever I ask of you. You indulge me In so many ways, My lord. In all four ages, I went about, Looking hard. I found none To match you, my lord. My lord, my heart Is fond of you. Come, come, My maiden friends, Let us go To view the groom. He's the one, the beloved I've attained. He comes to my home, The beloved, He but for whom A minute is hard to pass. How should we call him Unhappy - He whose lord Is one such as this? How should we find fault With the merciful? What's written In our karma Is what we shall have. Ram and Raheman Are but one Deity. Of this mystery, The fool is quite unaware. Says Saiyad Mohamadshah: I am bonded to you, My lord. Leaving you, At what other door Am I to knock? My lord, My heart is fond of you. I think of no-one else. None else pleases my heart. God, My heart is fond of you.Retrieved from the Institute of Ismaili Studies Website; Originally Published in: Esmail, Aziz. A Scent of Sandalwood: Indo-Ismaili Religious Lyrics.

This fish can also be found in the aquarium trade. It is currently the only known member of its genus.  Etymology  The generic name is a compound noun, made up of the surname Regan, in honour of the British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan (1878-1943) of the British Museum (Natural History), and the Greek word chromis which was used by Aristotle for a type of fish. This was probably the drum Sciaenidae and may be derived from the word chroemo which means \\"to neigh\\" in reference to the noise made by drums. This word was applied to a number of percomorph fishes, such as damselfish, cardinalfish, dottybacks, wrasses and cichilds, by ichthyologists as these were thought to be closely related.

Early life Carlo Di Palma was born into a poor Roman family; his mother was a flower seller on the Spanish Steps, while his father was a camera operator for a number of Italian film studios. In an interview shortly before his death, Di Palma recounted his childhood memories of observing his father in action: \\"I'd run to the studio or the location, and watch my father work. I was fascinated by the whole experience. I would stand on a crate sometimes and watch. All of the people that were on the location were pleasant to me. I was very quiet and observant, so with that they let me stay on set. I would watch many different directors over and over.\\" Career Di Palma's collaborations with Antonioni included Il deserto rosso (1964); the \\"Il provino\\" segment in I tre volti (1965); Blowup (1966); Identificazione di una donna (1982). With Woody Allen, he worked on Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Radio Days (1987), September (1987), Alice (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), Husbands and Wives (1992), Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), Bullets over Broadway (1994), Don't Drink the Water (1994), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), Everyone Says I Love You (1996), and Deconstructing Harry (1997). He also worked with many other noted film directors during his long and productive career. He is also a little- known film director. Carlo Di Palma moved from Italy to the United States in 1983. He won a Silver Ribbon for best cinematography four times: in 1965 for Il deserto rosso, in 1967 for L'armata Brancaleone, in 1993 for Shadows and Fog, and in 1997 for Mighty Aphrodite, as well as the Outstanding European Achievement in World Cinema award in 2003. Later years Di Palma was hired to shoot Allen's film Anything Else (2003), and actually started location scouting before failing an insurance physical, which was required for all key personnel on the crew, resulting in his replacement by Darius Khondji, to Di Palma's great disappointment, as he had been eager to work again after having been on the sidelines for the past six years. Personal life In the 1980s, Di Palma married Adriana Chiesa, an exporter of Italian films. She nursed him through his final illness.

When he was two years old, Kobayashi's father Hisashi died. The Kobayashi family home was destroyed by the Bombing of Nagoya, so they stayed at his mother's (surnamed Kaifu) family house. One of Makoto's cousins, Toshiki Kaifu, were living in the same place. His another cousin is an astronomer, Norio Kaifu. After graduating from the School of Science of the Nagoya University in 1967, he obtained a DSc degree from Graduate School of Science of the Nagoya University in 1972.Makoto Kobayashi - website of Nagoya University During college years, he receive guidance from Shoichi Sakata and others.  Career  Nicola Cabibbo and Makoto Kobayashi Paul Krugman, Roger Tsien, Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Masukawa, Nobel Prize Laureates 2008, at a press conference at the Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm. After completing his doctoral research at Nagoya University in 1972, Kobayashi worked as a research associate on particle physics at Kyoto University. Together, with his colleague Toshihide Maskawa, he worked on explaining CP-violation within the Standard Model of particle physics. Kobayashi and Maskawa's theory required that there were at least three generations of quarks, a prediction that was confirmed experimentally four years later by the discovery of the bottom quark. Kobayashi and Maskawa's article, \\"CP Violation in the Renormalizable Theory of Weak Interaction\\", published in 1973, is the fourth most cited high energy physics paper of all time as of 2010. The Cabibbo‚ÄìKobayashi‚ÄìMaskawa matrix, which defines the mixing parameters between quarks was the result of this work. Kobayashi and Maskawa were jointly awarded half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work, with the other half going to Yoichiro Nambu.

Container ships are also subject certain limitations in size. Primarily, these are the availability of sufficiently large main engines and the availability of a sufficient number of ports and terminals prepared and equipped to handle ultra-large container ships. Furthermore, some of the world's main waterways such as the Suez Canal and Singapore Strait also restrict the maximum dimensions of a ship that can pass through them. The capacity of a container ship is measured by twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). In 2016, Prokopowicz and Berg-Andreassen defined a container ship with a capacity of 10,000 to 20,000 TEU as a Very Large Container Ship (VLCS), while that with a capacity greater than 20,000 TEU as an Ultra Large Container Ship (ULCS).

Rajoana Kalan  Rajoana Kalan has an official area of 562 Hectares and a population of 1,239 persons in 1991, and is in the local administration ward of Sudhar, 18 km from Mullanpur and not far from the towns of Jagraon and Moga. Rajoana Kalan is off the main road from Mullanpur to Raikot, between the River/Canal at Sudhar and Raikot, approximately two or three miles from Sudhar. Halwara village and the Halwara Air Force Base is even closer to village of Rajoana Kalan. Rajoana Kalan is located to the West of Ludhiana in Punjab. For directions from Ludhiana, turn left off the Firozepur Road at the town of Mullanpur to Raikot. The road to Rajoana Kalan is the turning to the right at a brick kiln works off the main road running between Mullanpur to Raikot, after passing through the village of Halwara and the Indian Air force base located there, and passing through the village/township of Sudhar.  Rajoana Khurd  Rajoana Khurd has an official area of 389 Hectares and a population of 1,616 in 1991, and is in the same local administration ward of Sudhar. The ancestry of the village and the people is of Jat Sikhs bearing the family name or surname of Natt. Natt‚Äôs of Rajoana Kalan, can be traced back to a woman known as Mai Bhatti. Mai Bhatti was daughter of a rich landowner ‚Äì zamindar or Sardar ‚Äì who gave her and her husband large areas of land surrounding the present village. Mai Bhatti and her husband had three sons. Reference to her husband and what happened to him is yet to be determined. She lived during the life and times of Guru Gobind Singh. History has it that when Guru Gobind Singh was engaged in the guerrilla war with the ruling Mughals in Delhi, he came to the place where Mai Bhatti lived with her three sons. He was without horse and or any carriage, and requested one to be found for him. He spent the night there and the next morning Mai Bhatti together with her three sons gave a lift to Guru Gobind Singh on a Manji (a small light cot / bed). This was a form of transport carriage in those days. Guru Gobind Singh found that one end of the Manji dipped lower than the other three, but could not see the reason for this. He asked the oldest son what the reason was and was told that it was because his mother, Mai Bhatti was bearing that end of the Manji. Guru Gobind Singh was extremely pleased and impressed with this demonstration of support from Mai Bhatti, and told her to ask for any reward she may wish for. Being a simple person, she asked that each of her sons find a bride and get married. Guru Gobind Singh was amused by the simplicity of her wishes and said that the sons would marry not only once but twice! He told Mai Bhatti to ask for something else ‚Äì probably expecting a materialistic request ‚Äì but keeping to her simple lifestyle, she said that once the sons were married if they could be blessed to be able to earn a living for their family. Guru Gobind Singh was once again pleased with the simple demand and blessed her sons with the prophecy that they would settle a village each. Today there are three villages originating from that one family ‚Äì firstly, Rajoana Kalan (the main village), secondly Chotta Rajoana (small Rajoana) also known officially as Rajoana Khurd, and thirdly the village of Tugal. There is a memorial plaque with details of Mai Bhatti‚Äôs place in Sikh history at the entrance to the Kila (the castle) in Rajoana Kalan. Initially all the families and descendants of Mai Bhatti‚Äôs sons lived within the Kila. This was in tradition of living in the large household of the ruling Sardars and in times of conflict back during the village‚Äôs history, it was a prudent thing to do. In the passage of time and as the size of the family increased, segments of the families slowly started to take up residence in the village, outside the Kila. This was a practical proposition, however it probably led to the relaxing of relationships and weakening of them. Balwant Singh Rajoana, convicted in the killing of Beant Singh, belongs to village Rajoana Kalan.

A native of Aichi Prefecture, Toshihide Maskawa graduated from Nagoya University in 1962 and received a Ph.D. degree in particle physics from the same university in 1967. His doctoral advisor was the physicist Shoichi Sakata. From early life Maskawa liked trivia, also studied mathematics, chemistry, linguistics and various books. In high school, he loved novels, especially detective and mystery stories and novels by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa. Career At Kyoto University in the early 1970s, he collaborated with Makoto Kobayashi on explaining broken symmetry (the CP violation) within the Standard Model of particle physics. Maskawa and Kobayashi's theory required that there be at least three generations of quarks, a prediction that was confirmed experimentally four years later by the discovery of the bottom quark. Maskawa and Kobayashi's 1973 article, \\"CP Violation in the Renormalizable Theory of Weak Interaction\\", is the fourth most cited high energy physics paper of all time as of 2010. The Cabibbo‚ÄìKobayashi‚ÄìMaskawa matrix, which defines the mixing parameters between quarks was the result of this work. Kobayashi and Maskawa were jointly awarded half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work, with the other half going to Yoichiro Nambu. Maskawa was director of the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics from 1997 to 2003. He is now special professor and director general of Kobayashi-Maskawa Institute for the Origin of Particles and the Universe at Nagoya University, director of Maskawa Institute for Science and Culture at Kyoto Sangyo University and professor emeritus at Kyoto University.

Wicca originated in the early twentieth century, when it developed amongst secretive covens in England who were basing their religious beliefs and practices upon what they read of the historical Witch-Cult in the works of such writers as Margaret Murray. It was subsequently popularised in the 1950s by a number of figures, in particular Gerald Gardner, who claimed to have been initiated into the Craft ‚Äì as Wicca is often known ‚Äì by the New Forest coven in 1939. Gardner's form of Wicca, the Gardnerian tradition, was spread by both him and his followers like the High Priestesses Doreen Valiente, Patricia Crowther and Eleanor Bone into other parts of the British Isles, and also into other, predominantly English- speaking, countries across the world. In the 1960s, new figures arose in Britain who popularised their own forms of the religion, including Robert Cochrane, Sybil Leek and Alex Sanders, and organisations began to be formed to propagate it, such as the Witchcraft Research Association. It was during this decade that the faith was transported to the United States, where it was further adapted into new traditions such as Feri, 1734 and Dianic Wicca in the ensuing decades, and where organisations such as the Covenant of the Goddess were formed. From the 1970s onward, books began to be published by such figures as Paul Huson, Scott Cunningham, and Stewart and Janet Farrar which encouraged self-initiation into the Craft, leading to a boost in the number of adherents and the development of traditions. With the rising popularity of Wicca, it was used as a partial basis for witchcraft-based American films and television shows, further increasing its profile, particularly amongst younger people, in the 1990s. Since the early 1990s, historians have published studies and research into the history of Wicca, including the American Aidan KellyKelly 1991.Kelly 2007. and the Britons Ronald HuttonHutton 1999. and Philip Heselton.Heselton 2000.Heselton 2003. Background=Early modern witch trials During the 16th and 17th centuries, a widespread moral panic took place across Europe and the American colonies. The social and political turmoil following periods of widespread crop failure, war, and disease, led to numerous men and women being accused of practicing malevolent witchcraft, which resulted in the witch trials in the early modern period. The accused were put on trial and alleged to be witches who worshiped the Devil and committed acts of diabolism that included the cannibalism of children and desecration of the Eucharist. Between 40,000 and 60,000 people were executed for witchcraft during this period.Gerd Schwerhoff: Vom Alltagsverdacht zur Massenverfolgung. Neuere deutsche Forschungen zum fr√ºhneuzeitlichen Hexenwesen. Zeitschrift \\"Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht\\" 46, 1995 Most scholars agree that the witch trials were the result of isolated incidents of hysteria in remote peasant communities. While many of the accused confessed to various acts of magic and Satanism, all did so under threat of torture, and historians agree that there is no evidence any of the victims of the trials were practicing any real magic or any non-Christian religious or magical practices.Jacqueline Simpson (1994). Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why? Folklore, 105:1-2: 89-96. DOI: 10.1080/0015587X.1994.9715877 Witch-cult hypothesis Portrait of Margaret Murray, 1928. An alternative explanation for the early modern witch trials, known as the Witch-cult hypothesis, was proposed by the German Professor Karl Ernst Jarcke in 1828. Jarcke's hypothesis claimed that the victims of the early modern witch trials were not innocents caught up in a moral panic, but members of a previously unknown pan-European pagan religion which had pre-dated Christianity, been persecuted by the Christian Church as a rival religion, and finally driven underground, where it had survived in secret until being revealed in the confessions of those accused in the witch trials. This idea was later endorsed by German historian Franz Josef Mone and French historian Jules Michelet. In the late 19th century, variations on this hypothesis were adopted by two Americans, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Charles Leland, the latter of whom promoted it in his 1899 book Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches. The witch-cult hypothesis' most prominent and influential advocate was the English Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who promoted it in a series of books ‚Äì most notably 1921's The Witch-Cult in Western Europe and 1933's The God of the Witches. Murray's books were the sources of many well-known motifs which have often been incorporated into Wicca. The idea that covens should have 13 members was developed by Murray, based on a single witness statement from one of the witch trials, as was her assertion that covens met on the cross-quarter days four times per year. Murray was very interested in ascribing naturalistic or religious ceremonial explanations to some of the more fantastic descriptions found in witch trial testimony. Murray suggested, based in part on the work of James Frazer in The Golden Bough, that the witches accused in the early modern trials were not in fact Satanists, but worshiped a pre- Christian god associated with forests and the natural world. Murray identified this god as Janus (or Dianus, following Frazer's suggested etymology), who she described as a \\"Horned God\\" of the wilds in order to explain descriptions of a horned Satan provided by witch trial confessions. Because those accused of witchcraft often described witches meetings as involving sexual orgies with Satan, she suggested that a male priest representing Dianus would have been present at each coven meeting, dressed in horns and animals skins, who engaged in sexual acts with the gathered women. Murray further interpreted descriptions of sexual intercourse with Satan as being cold and painful to mean that the priest would often use artificial implements on the witches when he became too exhausted to continue. Unlike most modern forms of religious witchcraft, Murray's conception of the witch-cult was therefore strictly patriarchal. In her hypothesis, witches worshiped a single god, and though a female figure in a role known as \\"the Maiden\\" would be present at coven gatherings, Murray did not consider her to represent a goddess. In this way, Murray's hypothesis, which had been based primarily of her interpretations of witch trial records, differed strongly from Leland's belief in a goddess- centered witch-cult focused on Diana and Aradia, derived from supposed rural Italian folk practices. =Benevolent witchcraft= One key aspect of Murray's witch-cult hypothesis, later adopted by Wicca, was the idea that not only were historical accounts of witches based in truth, but witches had originally been involved in benevolent fertility -related functions rather than malevolent hexing and cursing as traditionally portrayed. In examining testimony from the early modern witch trials, Murray encountered numerous examples of the kinds of curses and nefarious activities the accused people confessed to. Seeking to fit these into a framework in which descriptions of witchcraft had both a natural and pagan-religious explanation, Murray posited that these malevolent actions were actually twisted interpretations of benevolent actions, altered either under duress during the trials, or by practitioners themselves who had, over the years, forgotten or changed the \\"original\\" intent of their practices. For example, Murray interpreted Isobel Gowdie's confession to cursing a farm field by setting loose a toad pulling a miniature plough as originally having been not a curse on the field as Gowdie stated, but a means of ensuring fertility of the crops. Murray stated that these acts were \\"misunderstood by the recorders and probably by the witches themselves.\\"Murray 1921, p. 115. According to Murray: :For centuries both before and after the Christian era, the witch was both honoured and loved. Whether man or woman, the witch was consulted by all, for relief in sickness, for counsel in trouble, or for foreknowledge of forthcoming events. They were at home in the courts of Kings ... their mystical powers gave them the authority for discovering culprits, who then received the appropriate punishment. --Murray 1933, pp. 110-11. With these kinds of interpretations, Murray created for the first time the idea of the witch as a practitioner of good magic and religious rites to ensure fertility of people and the land. This ran counter to all previous ideas about what witchcraft was in history and folklore - even Leland's variant of the witch-cult hypothesis in Aradia depicted witches as not fully benevolent, but rather as revolutionary figures who would use cursing and black magic to exact revenge on their enemies, the upper classes, and the Catholic Church.Gary, Gemma (2018). \\"Forward\\". In Leland, Charles G. Aradia or the Gospel of Witches. London: Troy Books Publishing. =Covens and Sabbaths= Murray combined testimony from several witch trials to arrive at the idea that witches met four times per year at coven meetings or \\"Sabbaths\\". She also used one piece of testimony to arrive at the conclusion that covens were usually composed of 13 witches, led by a male priest who would dress in animal skins, horns, and fork-toed shoes to denote his authority (the dress was assumed to be a naturalistic explanation for accused witch's descriptions of Satan). The \\"Grand Master\\", according to Murray, not only represented the Horned God but was believed to fully embody him, allowing his presence at the Sabbath. She wrote: :This was undoubtedly the appeal of the Old Religion: the God was there present with his worshippers, they could see him, they could speak with him as friend to friend, whereas the Christian God was unseen and far away in Heaven. --Murray 1933, p. 90. According to Murray, the traditional name for coven gatherings, \\"Sabbath\\", was derived from s'esbattre, meaning \\"to frolic\\". Most historians disagree, arguing instead that the organizers of the witch trials adopted terms predominantly associated with Judaism, including \\"Sabbath\\", in order to denigrate witches as the equivalent to Jews, who were also highly denigrated in mainstream European culture during this period. In fact, many witch trial accounts used not only \\"Sabbath\\" but also \\"synagogue\\" in reference to gatherings of witches. =Criticism= Most mainstream folklorists, including most of Murray's contemporaries, did not take her hypothesis seriously. Rather than accept Murray's naturalistic explanation for the magical feats and rituals ascribed to witches during the early modern trials, other folklorists argued that the entire scenario was always fictitious and did not require a naturalistic explanation. The supposed details of the rituals and witchcraft practices described in trial records were simply invented by victims under torture or threat of torture, based on the kinds of diabolic rites that clergy of the time would have expected to hear about. Almost all of Murray's peers regarded the witch-cult theory as incorrect and based on poor scholarship. Modern scholars have notes that Murray was highly selective in the evidence she pulled from trial accounts, favoring details that supported her theory and ignoring details that clearly had no naturalistic analogue. Murray often contradicted herself within her own books, citing accounts in one chapter as evidence for naturalistic explanations while using exactly the same passages to argue opposite points in the next. Despite these criticisms, Murray was invited to write the entry on \\"witchcraft\\" for the 1929 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, which was reprinted for decades, last appearing in the 1969 edition. Rather than write an article that reflected the historical consensus on the witch trials, Murray used the opportunity to promote her own hypothesis in the Encyclop√¶dia, presenting it as fact. It was so influential that, according to folklorist Jacqueline Simpson, Murray's ideas became \\"so entrenched in popular culture that they will probably never be uprooted.\\" Though most late 20th and early 21st century historians have been critical of Murray's ideas and methods, a few credit her hypothesis with least a bit of underlying truth. Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, for example, argued that while most of Murray's arguments were \\"near nonsense\\", he also pointed to Carlo Ginzburg's discovery in the 1960s of the Italian benandanti, folk magicians who practiced anti-witchcraft magic and were themselves put on trial for witchcraft, as evidence that in at least some cases, the accusations of the witch trial organizers were not based entirely on panicked fantasy. Ginzburg himself distanced himself from Murray's hypothesis, though he also argued that the benandanti were a continuation of a pre-Christian shamanic tradition, an assertion which has itself been criticized by other scholars as lacking solid evidence. =Adoption by Gerald Gardner= Simpson noted that the only contemporary member of the Folklore Society who took Murray's ideas seriously was Gerald Gardner, who used them as the basis for Wicca. The witch-cult theory came to represent \\"the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself\\", with early Wiccans claiming to be members of Murray's hypothesized secret religion. Many Wiccans, particularly those of the early decades, believed that their religion was a continuation of the witch-cult. It was only during the 1980s and 1990s that some Wiccans began to see the idea of the Witch-Cult as a creation myth rather than as historical fact.Hutton 1999. p. 380. For instance, in 1998, Wiccan Jenny Gibbons stated that: Ancient matriarchy hypothesis Another hypothesis that would have major influence on Wicca during its development was the idea of primitive matriarchal religions, which derived from the work of the Swiss lawyer Johann Jakob Bachofen, was popular in Gardner's day, both among academics (e.g., Erich Neumann, Margaret Murray) and amateurs (e.g. Robert Graves). Later scholars (e.g. Carl Jung and Marija Gimbutas) continued research in this area, and later still Joseph Campbell, Ashley Montagu and others became admirers of Gimbutas' theories of matriarchies in ancient Europe. Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate. Some academics carry on research in this area (such as the 2003 World Congress on Matriarchal Studies). Critics argue that such matriarchal societies never actually existed and are an invention of researchers such as Margaret Murray. This is disputed by documentaries such as Blossoms of Fire (about contemporary Zapotec society). The idea of a supreme Mother Goddess was common in Victorian and Edwardian literature: the concept of a Horned God ‚Äì especially related to the gods Pan or Faunus ‚Äì was less common, but still significant.Hutton 1999. p. 33-51. Both of these ideas were widely accepted in academic literature and the popular press at the time.Hutton 1999. p. 151-170. The New Forest coven In 1954, Gerald Gardner, a retired English civil servant who had spent most of his life in the far east, and who was a member of The Folklore Society during Margaret Murray's tenure, published Witchcraft Today, in which he made the claim to have encountered surviving members of Murray's hypothesized early modern witch-cult. Gardner claimed that he had been initiated into a practising coven of the cult in September 1939, a group that has become known as the New Forest coven. Gardner claimed that this group had met in the New Forest in southern England, and that he had met some of their members initially through the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. He mentioned two of their members, a local worthy called \\"Old Dorothy\\", in whose house he claimed to have been initiated, and \\"Dafo\\", who became a friend of his and would remain so for many years. Doreen Valiente undertook research into the identity of \\"Old Dorothy\\", whose surname was Clutterbuck. She refuted the claims of those who had suggested that Dorothy had been the product of Gardner's imagination.Valiente, Doreen (1984). The Search For Old Dorothy. In Farrar, J. & Farrar, S. The Witches' Way. London: Hale. More recently, it has been doubted (notably by Ronald Hutton) whether the historical Dorothy Clutterbuck, who was outwardly an observant Christian and a pillar of the local community, really was involved in occult activities. In Hutton's view, Gardner may have used her name as a joke and/or as a subterfuge to conceal the identity of Dafo or some other individual. Valiente also assumed that Clutterbuck was the same individual as Dafo. Dafo herself seems to have been a teacher of music and elocution by the name of Edith Woodford-Grimes, and there have been persistent suggestions that she and Gardner were lovers. Possible originsEarly 20th century revival= Some, such as Isaac Bonewits, have argued that Valiente and Heselton's evidence points to an early 20th-century revival predating Gardner (by the New Forest Coven, perhaps), rather than an intact old Pagan religion. The argument points to historical claims of Gardner's that agree with scholarship of a certain time period and contradict later scholarship. Bonewits writes, \\"Somewhere between 1920 and 1925 in England some folklorists appear to have gotten together with some Golden Dawn Rosicrucians and a few supposed Fam-Trads to produce the first modern covens in England; grabbing eclectically from any source they could find in order to try and reconstruct the shards of their Pagan past.\\" =Order of Woodcraft Chivalry= It has been proposed, originally in the Druidic journal AislingSteve Wilson \\"Woodcrafting the Art of Magic\\", Aisling8 (1996) that Gardner's New Forest coven was the pagan section of the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry; this order performed rituals in the New Forest in the early 1920s and its pagan section honoured a moon goddess and a horned god, and believed in ritual nakedness. One of Ronald Hutton's informants reports that Gardner was familiar with this order at least by the 1950s. A major difficulty with identifying this group with the New Forest coven is that it does not appear to have met in the New Forest between 1934 and 1945. Gardner records a working by the coven in the New Forest in 1940 against the projected Nazi invasion. =George Pickingill's coven= A theory advanced by Bill Liddell is that the New Forest coven derived from a set of covens created by the nineteenth century cunning man George Pickingill, who lived in the Essex village of Canewdon. This claim is not widely accepted, although it does focus attention on the well documented and widespread \\"cunning folk\\" and their contribution to the history of British witchcraft. Gardnerian Wicca and the Bricket Wood coven (1946‚Äì1963) The witches' cottage, located on the grounds of Fiveacres nudist club, where the Bricket Wood coven met.The Witches Hut in 2006. Gardner, claiming to be fearful that the witch religion would die out, began to propagate it by forming the Bricket Wood coven in Hertfordshire circa 1946. He acted as the High Priest for the coven, and Edith Woodford-Grimes (a.k.a. \\"Dafo\\"), who also claimed to have been a member of the New Forest coven, acted as his High Priestess. However, Woodford-Grimes became concerned that Gardner's attempts to gain publicity would lead to a public backlash against her, and so she left the Bricket Wood coven in 1952. Chapter 11 and 12 In 1953, Gardner initiated a young woman named Doreen Valiente into the coven, and she soon went on to become the new High Priestess. Around the same time, Gardner composed the coven's Book of Shadows, a workbook of rituals, although he claimed it was of ancient origins. Valiente's influence on the developing religion was immediately felt. Gardner's early conception of religious witchcraft closely paralleled the system outlined by Margaret Murray, including a patriarchal structure which focused almost exclusively on the worship of Murray's \\"Horned God\\". However, under the influence of Valiente, emphasis soon shifted to emphasize the role of the goddess, bringing Gardner's witchcraft in line with pre-Murray sources like Charles Leland's Aradia. Gardner was also reportedly upset when Valiente recognized that significant portions of his rituals had been adapted with very little change from those developed in Aleister Crowley's tradition of Thelema. Gardner asserted that he had simply used Crowley's rituals to fill in the rather bare bones rituals he had been given by the New Forest coven.Sammy Bishop (2018). Negotiating Gender in Contemporary Occultism - Interview with Manon Hedenborg White. The Religious Studies Project. 10 Dec 2018. Accessed online 12 Dec 2018 at https://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/negotiating-gender-in- contemporary-occultism/ Nonetheless, Valiente helped Gardner rewrite the Book of Shadows, removing much of what she saw as \\"Crowleyanity\\", and adding sections such as the Charge of the Goddess, which she adapted from Aradia in poetic verse. Valiente and Gardner later had a falling out when she became frustrated with his repeated attempts to gain publicity for the coven, and when he tried to impose the so-called \\"Wiccan Laws\\", something which he claimed were used by the witch-cult but which Valiente believed he had simply made up. She left, along with several other members of the Bricket Wood coven, to found their own. The Bricket Wood coven continued on with members that included Jack Bracelin, Dayonis, Frederic Lamond and Lois Bourne. Gardner also propagated his witchcraft tradition, which came to be referred to as \\"Gardnerian\\" witchcraft, outside of his Bricket Wood coven. He initiated Patricia Crowther, Eleanor Rae Bone and Monique Wilson, all of whom went on to propagate Gardnerian Witchcraft through their own covens. Various other initiates began to spread the craft around Britain, for instance Charles Clark took the religion to England's northern neighbour, Scotland.The Wica Gardner eventually succeeded in gaining greater publicity for his religion. He gave interviews to several newspapers, some of which were positive, although others turned very negative, one even declaring \\"Witches Devil-Worship in London!\\". He also published a second non-fiction book on the subject, The Meaning of Witchcraft, in 1959, as well as running the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man up until his death in 1964. Gardner referred to members of his tradition as \\"the Wica\\", although he called the religion itself \\"Witchcraft\\", and never used the term \\"Wicca\\" in the sense as it is now known.Blogspot.com Gardner's sources The ritual format of Wicca shows the influence of late Victorian era occultism (even co-founder Doreen Valiente admitted seeing influence from Aleister Crowley), and there is very little in the ritual that cannot be shown to have come from earlier extant sources.See Nevill Drury. \\"Why Does Aleister Crowley Still Matter?\\" Richard Metzger, ed. Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult. Disinformation Books, 2003. The religion's spiritual content, however, is inspired by older Pagan faiths (for example, in the veneration of historical pagan deities), with Buddhist and Hindu influences (e.g. in the Wiccan doctrine of reincarnation). It has been posited by authors such as Aidan Kelly and Francis X. King that Gardner himself created the religion that he claimed to have discovered, rewriting the rituals of an older witchcraft tradition according to his own whim,Kelly believed that the New Forest coven's rituals were identical with those of Rhiannon Ryall before Gardner rewrote them (Crafting the Art of Magic p. 41-2); King states \\"Louis Wilkinson went on to tell me various interesting details of the practices of these Hampshire witches ‚Äì details which, I felt sure, made it certain that the group was not simply derived from the jaded tastes of middle-class intellectuals who adhered to the theories of Margaret Murray\\" (The Rites of Modern Occult Magic p. 178). and incorporating elements from the thesis of Dr. Margaret Murray, sources such as Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches by Charles Godfrey Leland and the practices of ceremonial magic.Aidan Kelly's theories have been critiqued in detail by Donald Hudson Frew (1991): Crafting the Art of Magic: A Critical Review. The original material in the rituals brought to light by Gardner is not cohesive, and mostly takes the form of substitutions or expansions within unoriginal material. Roger Dearnaley, in An Annotated Chronology and Bibliography of the Early Gardnerian Craft, describes it as a \\"patchwork\\". One element that is apparently distinctive is the use of ritual scourging and binding as a method of attaining an ecstatic trance for magical working. Hutton argues strongly that this practice in Wicca does not reflect sado-masochistic sexuality (he refers in this connection to Gardner's own collection of very mild, quasi- pornographic material, which showed no traces of such interests), but is simply a practical method of work alternative to drugs or other more strenuous methods. Heselton, writing in Wiccan Roots and later in Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration, argues that Gardner was not the author of the Wiccan rituals but received them in good faith from an unknown source. (Doreen Valiente makes this claim regarding the \\"basic skeleton of the rituals,\\" as Margot Adler puts it in Drawing Down the Moon.) He notes that all the Crowley material that is found in the Wiccan rituals can be found in a single book, The Equinox vol 3 no. 1 or Blue Equinox (1919). Gardner is not known to have owned or had access to a copy of this book, although he met with Crowley towards the end of the latter's life. Gardner admitted that \\"the rituals he received from Old Dorothy's coven were very fragmentary, and in order to make them workable, he had to supplement them with other material.\\"Julia Phillips, \\"History of Wicca in England: 1939 ‚Äì present day.\\" Lecture at the Wiccan Conference in Canberra, 1991 Development of Wicca=Hereditary Witchcraft (1950s) Gardner was not the only person claiming to be a member of a surviving remnant of the witch-cult; several others also emerged in the 1950s making this claim. They included Sybil Leek, Charles Cardell, Raymond Howard, Rolla Nordic and Robert Cochrane. They claimed to have been initiated into the cult by their ancestors, and described themselves as following \\"Hereditary\\" or \\"Traditional\\" forms of Witchcraft, whereas Gardner, some said, was propagating a modern, and invalid form. Their beliefs and practices however, were similar to those of Gardner, and some of their modern followers describe their faith as being a form of Wicca,\\"1734 Traditional Wicca\\" whereas others insist it is different and call it \\"Traditional Witchcraft\\". The terms \\"Wicca\\" and \\"Wiccen\\" were first used by Charles Cardell, not to refer purely to Gardnerians, but to refer to all followers of the Witch-Cult religion. In his notebooks he used the term \\"Wicca\\" to refer to the religion, and he called it the \\"Craft of the Wiccens\\" in a 1958 article in Light magazine. Initially there was an attempt to reconcile and unite all of these traditions claiming to be Witch-Cult remnants, for instance the Witchcraft Research Association, which was founded in 1964 by Sybil Leek. After Leek emigrated to the United States, Doreen Valiente took over presidency, and began publication of a magazine, Pentagram. Chapter 16, The Man in Black However both the magazine and the organisation collapsed amongst infighting by the various traditions, with Cochrane consistently insulting, and even calling for a \\"Night of the Long Knives\\", against Gardnerians. Wicca across the world (1960s) Within a few years of Gardner's propagation of the craft, Wicca had spread from England into neighbouring Scotland and Ireland. However, in the 1960s, it also began to spread much further abroad, most notably in the English-speaking nations of Australia and the United States. In Australia, Wicca \\"found a receptive social environment because of the long-standing presence and familiarity of Aboriginal culture with its 'pagan' (i.e. 'non-Christian') beliefs and practices\\". Gardnerian Wicca came to the United States through an Englishman who had recently emigrated to the US, named Raymond Buckland, and his wife, Rosemary. Raymond, working for British Airways, regularly returned to England, and he began to correspond with Gardner. In 1963, both Bucklands were initiated into the Gardnerian craft by Monique Wilson in a ceremony in Britain. The couple returned to America where they founded the Long Island coven in New York state, basing their practice upon the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. The coven was later taken over by a couple known only as Theos and Phoenix, who enlarged the Book of Shadows, adding further degrees of initiation which were required before members could found their own covens. Interest outstripped the ability of the mostly British-based covens to train and propagate members; the beliefs of the religion spread faster by the printed word or word of mouth than the initiatory system was prepared to handle.Accounts of would-be Wiccans who compiled rituals out of published sources together with their own imaginative reconstructions, without formal initiations, appear in Hans Holzer's The New Pagans (Doubleday, New York: 1973) Also in the 1960s, non-Gardnerian forms of Witchcraft (which are sometimes viewed as Wicca, or sometimes as \\"Traditional Witchcraft\\") made their way to the USA. The American Joseph Bearwalker Wilson corresponded with the English Robert Cochrane prior to Cochrane's ritual suicide in 1966, and from this he founded the 1734 Tradition. Sybil Leek too, an English witch from the New Forest, emigrated to California, where she continued to practice her craft, and teach others. In 1968 Gavin and Yvonne Frost established the Church and School of Wicca; which in 1972 became the first Federally recognised Wiccan church. It would be in the 2000s that Wicca would begin to gain a foothold in other nations; for instance, Ipsita Roy Chakraverti began to publicise it in India, and it also has a number of adherents in South Africa. Alexandrian Wicca (1963‚Äì1973) In the 1960s, an Englishman called Alex Sanders emerged, appearing in various newspapers. He claimed to be a hereditary witch, having been initiated into the craft by his grandmother. Later researchers, such as Ronald Hutton, have shown that he actually had been initiated into a Gardnerian coven, although Hutton notes that Sanders' grandmother was in fact \\"skilled in cunning craft\\". Sanders had previously practised as a spiritualist healer. Chapter 17, \\"Royalty from the North\\" His reputation in the tabloids increased when he married the much younger Maxine Sanders in a handfasting ceremony, and subsequently the duo began to refer to themselves as the \\"King and Queen of the Witches\\", at one point claiming to have the allegiance of 1,623 witches, and 127 northern covens. His tradition, which was later coined as \\"Alexandrian\\" by Stewart Farrar, an initiate of Sanders, incorporated aspects from ceremonial magic and the Qabalah, as well as Judeo-Christian iconography. Sanders justified this by claiming that his version of Wicca and Christianity were both forces for good, battling against the forces of darkness which were practised by Satanists and black magicians. Several Gardnerians, including Patricia Crowther and Ray Bone, tried to denounce Sanders as a charlatan, but he simply responded by accusing them of being the charlatans, and as being practitioners of black magic who abused their initiates. In 1973, Alex and Maxine separated, but both continued to practice the craft. One of the key reasons for their separation was that neither would compromise on Alex's bisexuality. After the divorce, Alex focused on formulating Wicca so that it could be followed by homosexual men, who had been partially prevented from involvement previously because of the religions' focus on gender polarity. He also initiated a number of people from continental Europe, who then spread the faith there. In 1979, Sanders issued an apology for his \\"past hurts\\" and \\"many public stupidities\\" and tried to encorouge co-operation between Gardnerians and Alexandrians. He died in 1988. Algard and Seax (1972‚Äì1974) In the United States, several forms of Wicca formed in the 1970s, based upon the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions, but with certain differences. These traditions were actually formed by those who had previously been initiated into Gardnerian or Alexandrian crafts, and so can still be traced to Gardner, and thereby are often considered to be forms of British Traditional Wicca. The first of these was Algard Wicca, founded in 1972 by Mary Nesnick, who had been initiated into both of the aforementioned traditions. Algard attempted to fuse the two together, thereby trying to prevent the arguments that were going on between the two. The following year, in 1973, Raymond Buckland, who had brought the Gardnerian craft to the USA originally, ceased to practice it, and formed a new tradition, known as Seax- Wica. Seax used the structure of traditional Gardnerian covens, but used the iconography of Anglo-Saxon paganism, so the God and the Goddess were represented not as the traditional Horned God and Mother Goddess, but as Woden and Freya. Seax was virtually unique amongst Wicca at the time as it did not work on an initiatory basis of covens; Buckland deliberately published all its rites and rituals in a book, The Tree, so that anyone could practice them. Dianic Wicca and the feminist movement (1971‚Äì1979) In 1971, a Hungarian- American named Zsuzsanna Budapest, who had no connection to any Gardnerian or Alexandrian covens, mixed Wiccan practices with feminist politics, forming Dianic Witchcraft (although now it is better known as \\"Dianic Wicca\\"). She began this with a coven in Los Angeles, that she named the Susan B. Anthony Coven Number One. Dianic Wicca focused almost exclusively upon the Goddess, and largely, and in some covens completely, ignoring the Horned God. Most covens were women-only, and some were designed specifically for lesbians. Like Seax-Wica, which developed around the same time, the rituals of Dianic Wicca were published by its creator so that any woman could practice it, without having the need of a specific initiation into a lineage. Indeed, Budapest believed that it was every woman's right to be able to practice the religion, and she referred to it as being \\"women's spirituality\\". Dianic Wicca was criticised by many Gardnerians at the time for having an almost monotheistic view of theology, in contrast with Wicca's traditional duotheism. One Gardnerian even declared \\"spare us Jahweh in drag!\\" in response to the focus on the one Goddess. One Gardnerian, who went under the craft name of Starhawk, started practising Dianic Wicca, and tried to reconcile the two, writing the 1979 book The Spiral Dance on the subject. The tradition she founded became known as Reclaiming, and mixed Wicca with other forms of Neopaganism such as Feri, along with strong principles of environmental protection. Solitaries and the \\"Wicca or Witchcraft\\" debate (1970‚Äì) In traditional Gardnerian and Alexandrian craft, initiates took an oath of secrecy never to reveal the rituals of it to outsiders. Despite this, both Gardner and Sanders sought publicity, and allowed reporters to witness their practices. Initiates such as Valiente and Buckland had been annoyed at this, the first commenting that \\"by speaking to the press, Gardner was compromising the security of the group and the sincerity of his own teachings\\". However, the key rituals of the Gardnerians (which were the basis for most of the Alexandrian ones) were made public in the 1960s when Charles Cardell, in an act of spite against the recently deceased Gardner, published the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In 1970, Paul Huson published Mastering WitchcraftHuson, Paul Mastering Witchcraft: A Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens, New York: G.P. Putnams, 1970 a book purportedly based upon non-Wiccan traditional British witchcraft, and the first do-it-yourself manual for the would-be witch, which became one of the basic instruction books for a large number of covens.Luhrmann, T.M. Persuasions of the Witch's Craft, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989, p.261 \\"Core Texts in Magical Practice\\"Kelly, Aidan A. Crafting the Art of Magic: A History of Modern Witchcraft, Minnesota: Llewellyn, 1991, p.61, on \\"the First Degree Initiation\\"Clifton, Chas S. The Paganism Reader, New York: Routledge, 2004 p.4 \\"Revival and diversification texts\\", pp. 170 ‚Äì 185, \\"Paul Huson: Preliminary Preparations\\" In 1971 Lady Sheba (Jessie Wicker Bell, 1920‚Äì2002), the Kentucky-born self-styled \\"Queen of the American Witches\\", published what she claimed was her family's centuries-old grimoire, but which in fact contained material substantially plagiarised from the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, and also included poetry by Doreen Valiente that was, and is, still under copyright. Doreen Valiente also published information on the subject of pagan Witchcraft, such as the 1973 book An ABC of Witchcraft, which contained a self-initiation ritual for solitary practitioners. Following this, other Wiccans decided that it would be better to simply reveal the Wiccan mysteries to the public in their true form. These included Stewart and Janet Farrar, two Alexandrian initiates. Stewart, prior to his marriage, had already published information on Wiccan rituals (with Sanders' blessing), in his 1971 book What Witches Do. Together they published further works on the subjects, such Eight Sabbats for Witches (1981) and The Witches' Way (1984). From these published writings, many other practitioners began to follow the Witchcraft religion, working either as solitary Witches or in non-lineaged covens. Valiente herself considered all of these such people to be \\"Witches\\", and she reserved the term \\"Wiccan\\" to refer solely to Gardnerians. Despite this, most of the newer followers used the term \\"Wiccan\\" to describe themselves, and in the United States, it became the norm to refer to any Neopagan witchcraft as \\"Wicca\\", and so Gardnerians, Alexandrians and Algards, wishing to emphasise their lineage that stretched back to Gardner, began referring to themselves as followers of \\"British Traditional Wicca\\". Contemporary Wicca=Pop- culture Wicca (1996‚Äì) In the 1990s and 2000s, Wicca began to become ingrained in popular culture. Aspects of Wicca were incorporated into the New Age movement, and many Wiccans took on New Age beliefs and practices. Wicca was also taken up by popular entertainment; in 1996, the American film The Craft was released about four witches who are corrupted by their power. The same year the television series Sabrina the Teenage Witch appeared, which was followed the following year by Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and in 1998 by the series Charmed and the film Practical Magic. Whilst these were heavily criticised by many Wiccans (Margot Adler called The Craft \\"the worst movie ever made!\\"), they did encourage many teenagers and young adults to investigate more about the religion. Most covens and Neopagan groups refused to allow under 18s into their ranks, and so many teenagers turned to books to find out more. In turn, several books were published to cater for them, including Silver RavenWolf's Teen Witch: Wicca for a New Generation and Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. This helped to bring about the Teen Wicca movement, and it has been suggested that the reason why so many young adults are attracted to the faith can \\"be attributed to the fact that it tackles issues that teenagers are interested in ‚Äì in a way that other religions do not.\\" BBC The popularity of Wicca amongst teens has also brought problems; in 2001, a 12-year-old American schoolgirl named Tempest Smith committed suicide after being bullied for her faith. However the rise of this teenage-focused, New Age, pop-culture Wicca has been highly criticised by traditionalists, many of whom refuse to accept it as Wicca, instead using terms like \\"wicca-lite\\". The historians Brooks Alexander and Jeffrey Russell commented that \\"pop-culture witchcraft is sufficiently vague in structure and content to qualify more as a 'lifestyle' than a 'religion'.\\" The rise of the internet also had an effect on Wicca. Previously, solitary Wiccans around the world had little way of communicating amongst one another, however, the internet allowed them to do so. Websites such as Witchvox.com were set up. Historian Brooks Alexander commented that this was a form of \\"minority empowerment\\". Gaining recognition For a long time, Wicca was seen as being simply a minor sect, or cult. However, with the rise of solitary practitioners describing themselves as Wiccans, the faith went from becoming simply a mystery cult to becoming a public religion. Groups were formed to represent the Wiccan community, such as the Covenant of the Goddess, which was founded in 1975. Wiccans began to appear on various British television documentaries, including The Heaven & Earth Show and Desperately Seeking Something. In the US, the court case of Dettmer v. Landon in 1986 established that Wicca was a religion, and therefore should be treated as such under the eyes of the law. The first Wiccan wedding to be legally recognised in the UK (by the Registrars of Scotland) was performed in 2004.Wiccan celebrant George Cameron (\\"The Hermit\\"), Grand Master of the Source Coven said: This is the most important event since the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1951. I am delighted because I have been trying to make this happen for many years. It is the biggest thing to hit pagan witchcraft for years. This is very significant as the ceremony is classed as a religious ceremony, which gives credence to the Craft and recognises it as a religious faith.

She was the senior author on a classic 1947 paper showing that the toxin victorin, produced by the pathogenic fungus Helminthosporium victoriae, caused symptoms of Victoria blight of oats, a new disease first described by Latterell and her major professor in 1946. This discovery of a host-specific toxin, as victorin was later named, gave scores of subsequent researchers new model systems for studying plant disease.  Life  Latterell, a native of Kansas City, Missouri, an accomplished child pianist, received her BA degree from the University of Kansas City and MS and PhD degrees from Iowa State University. During her career as research plant pathologist, US army biological laboratories, Fort Detrick, Maryland and plant pathologist, US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Frederick, Maryland, she conducted extensive research on cereal diseases, including gray leaf spot of corn and rice blast. In recognition of her long and active membership in the Potomac Division of the American Phytopathological Society, Latterell was given the Division‚Äôs Distinguished Service Award in 1987. Since retirement in 1996 she and her husband, Dr. Richard Latterell, an environmentalist and biology professor emeritus at Shepherd University, have been active in animal welfare and environmental causes including water pollution and lead arsenate pollution in housing developments built on former apple orchards in Jefferson County, West Virginia, where they have lived for many years in an 18th-century farmhouse nearby Moler's Crossroads. They have also been active participants in local zoning and political campaigns. From 2005 to 2007 R. Latterell and other citizens have been the targets of a SLAPP suit for two million dollars in damages, seeking to punish them for their citizen activism. R. Latterell and the two other defendants were granted summary judgment in April, 2007 by the Circuit Court of Berkeley County, West Virginia in a decision upholding the defendants' First Amendment right to utilize administrative proceedings. Vegetarian, atheist, and childless, in 2005 the Latterells put their farm under a perpetual conservation easement under the auspices of the West Virginia Farmland Protection Act, a statute whose passage the Latterells actively supported. Francis Mehan Latterell died of cancer on November 5, 2008.  Toxins Cause Disease  The idea that toxins caused plant diseases goes back to papers in 1886 and 1913, but Latterell's 1947 paper and a 1955 paper by H. H. Luke gave the first proofs. Latterell showed that fungus creates a toxin which causes the same symptoms as Victoria blight on the same oat cultivars which suffer from Victoria blight, but causes no symptoms on cultivars which resist the blight. Luke went on to show that different strains of the fungus create different levels of toxin, which correlate with the effects seen in oats. She was the only female scientist to participate in a ground-breaking meeting on ‚ÄúThe Rice Blast Disease‚Äù organized by IRRI in 1963. In 1973 Latterell and Luke shared the prestigious Ruth Allen Award in plant pathology. Its citation said, \\"The work of these two investigators provided the impetus for, and guided the direction of, much of the research on the role of toxins in plant diseases during the past two decades, victorin alone has been the subject of more than 100 research reports from several different laboratories. Their work also served as the model for research on many other diseases in which toxins play a role. Laboratory exercises based on the methods developed with victorin are a routine part of plant pathology courses in a large number of institutions. The demonstration that toxins may provide valid substitutes for pathogens led to practical applications in mass screening for disease resistance and in toxin tests for identification of mixtures in seed lots.\\" (Phytopathology, v. 63, December 1973, p. 9) The Ruth Allen Award has been given since 1966 by the American Phytopathological Society. It honors individuals who have made an outstanding, innovative research contribution that has changed, or has the potential to change, the direction of research in any field of plant pathology. (It has no relation to the pipeline industry's Ruth Allen award established in 2005.) She also received the National Science Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award. On August 17, 2010 Frances Latterell was posthumously recognized at the 5th International Rice Blast Conference with a Lifetime Dedication to Rice Blast Research Award. The fungus' asexual stage was called Helminthosporium victoriae when Latterell and Luke published their work. Since then it has been renamed Bipolaris victoriae. Its sexual stage (teleomorph) is called Cochliobolus victoriae. Latterell's classic paper was \\"Differential Phytotoxicity of Metabolic By-Products of Helminthosporium victoriae\\" published in Science, v. 104, pp. 413‚Äì414, September 19, 1947.

Due to the upcoming cancellation of the show, the inside of Michaelson's house was never shown in order to save on designing an internal set. Description Jack moved into 8 Brookside Close, several months after the Farnhams had previously sold up and moved to Woolton. Jack was quite rude to his neighbours and had run-ins with them on frequent occasions. Upon seeing Jack move in, Sean Smith (Barry Sloane) decided to offer his services erecting a television aerial for Jack. Jack was deliberately rude to Sean. Later when Jack's delivery man turned up late, Jack intimidated him and gave him unreasonable orders. When Jack complained about the mess, the man apologised. In response to this, Jack gave him a vicious beating in front of all the neighbours. He then had a run-in with Tim O'Leary (Philip Olivier) when Jack complained about Tim and Steve Murray's (Steven Cartait) limousine apparently blocking his drive. Jack gave Tim a stern warning to move the limo. When Steve decided to move the limo, Tim shouted at Steve and told him not to give into Jack. He also supplied drugs to Ali Gordon (Kris Mocherrie) and his friend Tommo. When he heard that Ali got arrested for taking drugs, he called round to Ali's house where he threatened to murder Ali if he mentioned to the police about where he really got the drugs from. Ali continued to take drugs but this would result in a near tragedy when his nephew Luke (Callum Giblin), whom he was babysitting, picked up and took one of the drugs which Ali had dropped on the floor. When Jack found out his daughter Suzi (Simone Barry) was taking drugs he barged his way into the Murrays' house and attacked Steve's brother Anthony (Ray Quinn). When Tony's stepmother Jan (Helen Sheals) tried to restrain Jack, he hit her across the face. In retaliation for this, Steve, his father and Jan's husband Marty (Neil Caple) and Marty's brother Christy (Glyn Pritchard) jumped Jack and attacked him with two-by-four planks of wood. In retaliation, Jack attacked Christy with a baseball bat in the middle of the close, forcing him to have a kidney removed despite Ron Dixon (Vince Earl), his wife Bev (Sarah White) and her son Josh McLoughlin's (Jack McMullen) attempts at stopping Jack from attacking Christy. Jack caused further trouble when Anthony wound up in hospital after smoking a crack joint and having a bad reaction to it. Suzi had given Anthony the joint; she also ended up in hospital. After a conversation Tim had with Barry Grant (Paul Usher), the residents of Brookside Close lynched Jack from his own window. The culprits who did this were never made clear, however when the residents were moving out Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan), Tim, the Gordons and the Murrays all used the same type of rope that hanged Jack to attach their possessions to their cars. This is somewhat reminiscent of when Sue (Annie Miles) and Danny Sullivan were pushed from the scaffolding of Brookside Parade and all the suspects were wearing the same clothes to prevent viewers being able to detect the killer. The police wrote his lynching off as a drugs killing as everyone involved had an alibi and nobody on the street claimed to see his killers. Jack's hung body was found by a passing milkman the morning after the night he was lynched. The name Jack Michaelson was a play on the name of Channel 4's previous chief executive Michael Jackson.

A home version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. The original coin-op game is included in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for PlayStation Portable, and Capcom Arcade Cabinet for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Plot Set in an unspecified year during the third millennium, the player takes the role of an astronaut sent to infiltrate and destroy a space station orbiting near the Earth that is actually the secret base of an alien empire known as the \\"Balangool\\". Arcade version The player maneuvers the space ranger throughout the enemy space station, which consists of 26 alphabetically ordered corridors known as \\"sections\\", starting from Section A and ending at the titular Section Z. The game is divided into five stages, each consisting of five sections (with the final stage having six sections to accommodate the spare letter). The player will fight an enemy boss at the end of each stage, concluding with the final battle against the \\"L Brain\\" at Section Z. The game's stages alternates between horizontal-scrolling stage (left or right) and upwards vertical-scrolling stages. The player will lose a life every time they get hit by enemy fire. Additional lives can be obtained if the player achieves a high enough score. The game will be over if the player loses all of their lives, although a chance to continue will be provided. The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one for shooting and the other for changing the character's aim to the left or right. This allows the player to shoot in one direction while moving away towards the opposite. The player will shoot their rifle towards the left or the right with the fire button, while dropping bombs at the same time to the ground. By destroying certain dome-shaped containers, the player can obtain one of three power-up items represented by letters: S, P, and B. S increases the player's mobility speed, while P increases their firing power; each can improved for up to three increments. However, these power-ups will be lost whenever the player loses a life. The B item will simply give the player bonus points. Famicom/NES version A console version of Section Z was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe in 1987. The gameplay was altered for the NES port, particularly in its level design and game controls. The NES version features three stages, each comprising 20 sections (for a total of 60 sections), which are full-fledged levels in this version, although not all sections need to be visited to complete the game. In contrast to the alphabetical sections in the arcade version, the sections in the NES version are numbered instead. The first stage, Section 00, is the outer perimeter of the space station and then proceeds to enter Section 01, the first actual corridor of the base. At the end of most sections, the player will choose to enter one of two transporters, each taking player to a different section of the base. Some transporters will take the player to a previous section while others cannot be opened until the player has fulfilled a certain condition and will kill the player if they try to enter. The objective of each stage is to destroy the two power generators located at different sections of each stage in order to open the path to the final section of each stage (Sections 19, 39, and 59 in that order) and face the boss. Instead of using one button to fire and the other to turn around, the player now uses one button to fire in one direction and the other to fire in the opposite. The player starts with a standard-issue laser rifle and can upgrade their weapon into a Flash Buster (which fires medium-range bullets in three directions) or a Megasmasher (which fires wider v-shaped laser beams). Either weapon can be upgraded into the Mega Buster, which provides both, wider-long range shots in three directions. The player can also obtain a Barrier Shield that will protect the player character for 32 shots. The player also has a numeral indicator which represents their remaining energy, which will gradually be depleted when the player takes damage from enemy bullets or when the player loses a life by touching an enemy. However the player can still continue at the beginning of their current section, even if they lose all of their lives, as long as they still have energy left. When all energy is lost, the player is sent the start of the stage with full energy to start all over. The maximum energy can be increased by destroying the power generators in each stage. The player can also summon as a special transmission shell by pressing both button simultaneously. These include a Mega Missile, a Flash Bomb, and a Crush Ball. Picking these shells and using them will cost the player four energy points. The Famicom version in Japan was released in Disk Card format for the Family Computer Disk System add-on. In contrast to its NES counterpart, which makes the player complete the game in one sitting, the Disk System allowed players to save their progress in one of three save files. After a game over, the player can quit the game and resume where they left off by loading the save file. The English localization of the game's manual identifies the main character as \\"Captain Commando\\", a fictional spokesman for Capcom USA who later starred in his own video game.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Section Z on their January 15, 1986 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

Because of the shifting nature of the barrier island system of which Pea Island is a part, and the way in which inlets open and close over time, Pea Island has, at times, been contiguous with the neighboring islands of Bodie Island or Hatteras Island. Pea Island was created when two inlets, the New Inlet in 1738, and Oregon Inlet in 1846, separated it from the neighboring islands. The island was rejoined to Hatteras Island intermittently from 1922 until 1945 as the narrow New Inlet opened and closed with shifting sands. Pea Island ceased to exist entirely from 1945 until 2011, when Hurricane Irene reopened the New Inlet, recreating Pea Island. From 1945 to 2011, Pea Island was merely the northern 11 miles or so of Hatteras Island. Pea Island was home to the Pea Island Life-Saving Station, the first U.S. Coast Guard life-saving station to have an all African-American crew.

Simplified Chinese version and Traditional Chinese version He is the eldest son of Ng Teng Fong, a Singaporean real estate billionaire. Forbes listed them together as the 30th richest people in the world in 1997. As of July 2017, Robert, along with his brother Philip Ng, has an estimated net worth of $9.7 billion. Career Ng was speculating in futures contracts on the Hong Kong Futures Exchange through two Panamanian-registered companies when the October 1987 global stock market crash began; his paper losses reportedly reached HK$1 billion. At first, Ng refused to pay, claiming to be protected by the limited liability of the companies through which he had traded. This led to the collapse of the futures exchange; trading was also halted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for four days. An investigation by the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Royal Hong Kong Police revealed that Ng had avoided required margin calls through collusion with one of his brokers. However, in the end, no charges were laid against Ng because the colonial government of Hong Kong felt that prosecuting him would pose a risk to overall market stability. Instead, a deal was worked out which saw Ng repay HK$500 million, with Hong Kong taxpayers providing the rest of the funds needed by the Exchange through a government bailout. Ng reportedly lost a total of US$250 million in his various investment holdings as a result of the crash. In June 1995, Ng took over as chairman of Yeo Hiap Seng (YHS), a Singapore-listed food and beverages company which had lost US$3.2 million in its previous year of operation. His chairmanship came at the same time as his family increased its stake in the company to 24.9%, just short of the 25% threshold above which they would be required by law to make an offer to buy out all other shareholders. This marked a step forward in his fight with Malaysian billionaire investor Quek Leng Chan for control of YHS and its land holdings in Singapore's Bukit Timah district, which could be worth billions of dollars were they redeveloped into residential real estate. In the end, Ng and his father were able to successfully take advantage of squabbles within the Yeo family to buy up 86% of YHS' stock. Their battle to gain control of the company was later described as \\"one of the most colourful take-over struggles in Singapore history\\" and led to YHS' transformation from a food company to a luxury real estate developer. The Sino Group also spun off their hotel interests into a new company, Sino Hotels, in that year; Ng became chairman of the board of the new company as well from its inception. In early 1997, under Ng's direction, Sino Hotels made several acquisitions, including an 80% stake in the local branch of the Conrad Hotel for HK$2 billion. Ng also predicted that office properties would perform well during that year. For the latter six months of that year, Sino Hotels reported a 66% fall in net interim profits and 80% fall in operating profit, which Ng attributed to lower contributions not just from hotels but from the company's Fortune chain of Chinese restaurants as well. However, the Conrad proved to be a resilient investment, with the average room rate increasing by 14.7% during the months in question. Positions , Ng is the director of a number of subsidiaries and associated companies of Sino Group: # Chairman of Tsim Sha Tsui Properties Limited, parent company of Sino Land # Chairman of Sino Hotels (Holdings) Limited # Independent non-executive director of The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited # Director of the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong # Member of the 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference # Non-executive director of SCMP Group Limited from May 2004 to May 2007 # Chairman of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong) since its inception in 1995 Voting and political views Due to his business positions, Ng wields a significant amount of power under Hong Kong's functional constituency system. In 1998, he and companies owned by Sino Group controlled roughly 3‚Äì4% of the votes in the real estate constituency, and an additional two votes in the tourism constituency. The voting power he wields through this system has been described as equivalent to anywhere from 6,100 to 15,940 votes in geographic constituencies, which has led to criticism by the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor. Ng has spoken out in support of the \\"Application List\\" system for the sale of government land and in 2008 remained publicly optimistic about the prospects for the Hong Kong property market. Family and personal life Ng is married to Yeoh Saw Kheng (Ê•äÁ¥†Áìä) a fellow ethnic Chinese of Cantonese descent, who is the 3rd daughter of Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng, the former Speaker of Parliament of Singapore Robert Ng is staunch Christian and refer to Far East as a Christian enterprise.#123 Robert & Philip Ng Ng's eldest son Daryl Ng Win Kong was born in 1978. He holds Singaporean citizenship and joined the mandatory military service; at the same time, he speaks passionately about his Hong Kong root and childhood spent in Hong Kong, reminding that he was born at Queen Mary Hospital and attended Diocesan Boys' School rather than an international school in his youth. He later studied in the United States, where he graduated from Columbia University in 2003, and after two years as a project manager in Sino Group was appointed an executive director in 2005. He is generally expected to be his father's successor. In 2007 he began to take a more public role, first appearing at a land auction with his father in October that year. During his first time speaking with the media about the property market in March 2008, he spoke only briefly. Since then he has spoken on various occasions and has taken up public duties. He advocates sustainability and heritage, and champions projects like mini hydro power,Sino Land boss Daryl Ng tries mini-turbines in taps to generate electricity, SCMP, 23 October 2013 food waste management, Tai O Heritage Hotel in Hong Kong and The Fullerton Heritage in Singapore. He is married with a son and a daughter. Ng also has two younger sons David Ng Win Loong (ÈªÉÊ∞∏Èæç) and Alexander Ng Win Yew (ÈªÉÊ∞∏ËÄÄ). Ng's eldest daughter, Nikki Ng Mien Hua (ÈªÉÊïèËèØ) attended Yale University as an undergraduate, and went on to receive a master's degree from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. She was later appointed to the position of general manager of the Sino Group.; includes a picture of Daryl and Nikki Ng at a ceremony after the opening of one of the Sino Group's new real estate projects Her activities outside of Sino Group include membership of the 11th Qingdao Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Ng also has two younger daughters Jeanne Ng Mien Yi (ÈªÉÊïèÂÑÄ) and Christine Ng Mien Yin (ÈªÉÊïèÈü≥). Beginning in the late 1990s, the family became more active in the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Daryl, Nikki, and Jeanne own four horses between them, while the elder Ng himself owns eight and his wife one. At one point in 2002, Ng was said to be interested in joining the 12-member board of stewards of the Hong Kong Jockey Club; however, some of the club's 200 voting members objected due to Ng's conduct during the futures market collapse in 1987. Both Daryl and Nikki are members of the five-person board of the Hong Kong Heritage Conservation Foundation. The HKHCF was initially set up under the name Nice Brilliant Limited in December 2007, and changed its name in March 2008. In October 2008, the HKHCF made a bid for the revitalisation of the Old Tai O Police Station, with the intention of turning it into a boutique hotel; legislators looked suspiciously at the foundation's ties to the Sino Group, with Fernando Cheung accusing them of being a \\"one-man NGO\\" set up for business purposes rather than social service. The HKHCF's bid was eventually successful; the project, Tai O Heritage Hotel, was opened on 1 March 2012, with an estimated cost of HK$64.9 million.

Men's trousers were worn cuffed to ankle-length and creased. Skirts rose from floor length to well above the ankle, women began to bob their hair, and the stage was set for the radical new fashions associated with the Jazz Age of the 1920s.Boucher, Fran√ßois: 20,000 Years of Fashion, Harry Abrams, 1966, pp. 400‚Äì408Laver, James: The Concise History of Costume and Fashion, Abrams, 1979, pp. 224‚Äì230. In 1910, journalist Marguerite Martyn visited the Missouri State University (now University of Missouri) campus in Columbia and sketched these two fashionable students. Women's fashion=Oriental Opulence Lucile (1863‚Äì1935) During the early years of the 1910s the fashionable silhouette became much more lithe, fluid and soft than in the 1900s. When the Ballets Russes performed Scheherazade in Paris in 1910, a mania for Orientalism ensued. The couturier Paul Poiret was one of the first designers to translate this vogue into the fashion world. Poiret's clients were at once transformed into harem girls in flowing pantaloons, turbans, and vivid colors and geishas in exotic kimono. The Art Deco movement began to emerge at this time and its influence was evident in the designs of many couturiers of the time. Simple felt hats, turbans, and clouds of tulle replaced the styles of headgear popular in the 1900s (decade). It is also notable that the first real fashion shows were organized during this period in time, by the first female couturier, Jeanne Paquin, who was also the second Parisian couturier to open foreign branches in London, Buenos Aires, and Madrid. Two of the most influential fashion designers of the time were Jacques Doucet and Mariano Fortuny. The French designer Jacques Doucet excelled in superimposing pastel colors and his elaborate gossamery dresses suggested the Impressionist shimmers of reflected light. His distinguished customers never lost a taste for his fluid lines and flimsy, diaphanous materials. While obeying imperatives that left little to the imagination of the couturier, Doucet was nonetheless a designer of immense taste and discrimination, a role many have tried since, but rarely with Doucet's level of success. The Venice-based designer Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo was a curious figure, with very few parallels in any age. For his dress designs he conceived a special pleating process and new dyeing techniques. He patented his process in Paris on 4 November 1910. He gave the name Delphos to his long clinging sheath dresses that undulated with color. The name Delphos came from the bronze statue of the Charioteer at Delphi. Each garment was made of a single piece of the finest silk, its unique color acquired by repeated immersions in dyes whose shades were suggestive of moonlight or of the watery reflections of the Venetian lagoon. Breton straw, Mexican cochineal, and indigo from the Far East were among the ingredients that Fortuny used. Among his many devotees were Eleonora Duse, Isadora Duncan, Cl√©o de M√©rode, the Marchesa Casati, √âmilienne d‚ÄôAlen√ßon, and Liane de Pougy. Tunics and hobble skirts The extravagances of the Parisian couturiers came in a variety of shapes, but the most popular silhouette throughout the decade was the tunic over a long underskirt. Early in the period, waistlines were high (just below the bust), echoing the Empire or Directoire styles of the early 19th century. Full, hip length \\"lampshade\\" tunics were worn over narrow, draped skirts. By 1914, skirts were widest at the hips and very narrow at the ankle. These hobble skirts made long strides impossible. Waistlines were loose and softly defined. They gradually dropped to near the natural waist by mid-decade, where they were to remain through the war years. Tunics became longer and underskirts fuller and shorter. By 1916 women were wearing calf-length dresses. When the Paris fashion houses reopened after the war, styles for 1919 showed a lowered and even more undefined waist. Suits and coats The tailleur or tailored suit of matching jacket and skirt was worn in the city and for travel. Jackets followed the lines of tunics, with raised, lightly defined waists. Fashionable women of means wore striking hats and fur stole or scarves with their tailleurs, and carried huge matching muffs. Most coats were cocoon or kimono shaped, wide through the shoulders and narrower at the hem. Fur coats were popular. World War I Changed dresses during World War I were dictated more by necessity than by fashion. As more and more women entered the workforce, they demanded clothes that were better suited to their new activities; these derived from the shirtwaists and tailored suits. Social events were postponed in favor of more pressing engagements and the need to mourn the increasing numbers of dead, visits to the wounded, and the general gravity of the time meant that darker colors and simpler cuts became the norm. A new monochrome look emerged that was unfamiliar to young women in comfortable circumstances. Women dropped the cumbersome underskirts from their tunic-and-skirt ensembles, simplifying dress and shortening skirts in one step. By 1915, the Gazette du Bon Ton was showing full skirts with hemlines at calf length. These were called the \\"war crinoline\\" by the fashion press, who promoted the style as \\"patriotic\\" and \\"practical\\".Steele, Valerie: Paris Fashion: A Cultural History, Oxford University Press, 1988, pp. 237‚Äì238 Styles of Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, as presented in a vaudeville circuit pantomime and sketched by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in April 1918 Furthermore, people were dressing less extravagantly due to funds being put toward the war effort. According to Eileen Collard, Coco Chanel took notice of this and introduced costume jewelry. She replaced expensive necklaces with glass or crystal beads. \\"Without grading them to size, she mixed pearls with other beads to fashion original jewelry to be worn with her designs\\" that were inspired by women joining the workforce.Collard, Eileen. Decade of Change Circa 1909‚Äì1919. Burlington, Ontario, 1981. 9. Footwear Shoes had high, slightly curved heels. Shorter skirts put an emphasis on stockings, and gaiters were worn with streetwear in winter. \\"Tango shoes\\" inspired by the dance craze had criss-crossing straps at the ankles that peeked out from draped and wrapped evening skirts.*Black, J. Anderson, and Madge Garland, A History of Fashion, New York, Morrow, 1975, pp. 308‚Äì314 During the war years, working women wore sensible laced shoes with round toes and lower wedge heels. Hairstyles and hats Large hats with wide brims and broad hats with face- shadowing brims were the height of fashion in the early years of the decade, gradually shrinking to smaller hats with flat brims. Bobbed or short hair was introduced to Paris fashion in 1909 and spread to avant-garde circles in England during the war.See Bob cut Dancer, silent film actress and fashion trendsetter Irene Castle helped spread the fashion for short hairstyles in America.Burbank, Emily, Woman as Decoration, New York, Dodd, Mead and Company, 1917. Hair, even short hair, was frequently supplemented with postiches, small individual wigs, curls, or false buns which were incorporated into the hairstyle.Long, Emile, Hairstyles and Fashion: A Hairdresser's History of Paris, 1910‚Äì1920, edited with an introduction by Steven Zdatny, Berg (Oxford International Publishers Ltd), 1999 The Corset As women began to become more active with dance and sport, they started to remove their corsets at parties in order to move more freely. In response corset manufacturers marketed the dance corset, which was less constricting, lighter, and more flexible. This shift made it a necessity to own more corsets because they served different functions. At the same time women now had more agency to decide their own shapes with the variety of corsets available.

World leaders at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919, wear morning dress and lounge suits. In general, styles were unchanged from the previous decade. Hair was generally worn short. Wide moustaches were often curled. A decline in wearing facial hair, a trend which had begun around the beginning of the century, continued throughout the decade as more clean shaven styles appear. Coats, waistcoats, and trousers The sack coat or lounge coat continued to replace the frock coat for most informal and semi-formal occasions. Three-piece suits consisting of a sack coat with matching waistcoat (U.S. vest) and trousers were worn, as were matching coat and waistcoat with contrasting trousers, or matching coat and trousers with contrasting waistcoat. Trousers were ankle length with turn-ups or cuffs, and were creased front and back using a trouser press. The gap between the shorter trousers and the shoes was filled with short gaiters or spats. Waistcoats fastened lower on the chest, and were collarless. The blazer, a navy blue or brightly colored or striped flannel coat cut like a sack coat with patch pockets and brass buttons, was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities. The Norfolk jacket remained fashionable for shooting and rugged outdoor pursuits. It was made of sturdy tweed or similar fabric and featured paired box pleats over the chest and back, with a fabric belt. Worn with matching breeches or (U.S. knickerbockers), it became the Norfolk suit, suitable for bicycling or golf with knee-length stockings and low shoes, or for hunting with sturdy boots or shoes with leather gaiters. The cutaway morning coat was still worn for formal day occasions in Europe and major cities elsewhere, with striped trousers. The most formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark or light waistcoat. Evening wear was worn with a white bow tie and a shirt with a winged collar. The less formal dinner jacket or tuxedo, which featured a shawl collar with silk or satin facings, now generally had a single button. Dinner jackets, worn with a white shirt and a dark tie, were gaining acceptance outside of the home. Knee-length topcoats and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter. Fur coats were worn in the coldest climates. Shirts and neckties Formal dress shirt collars were turned over or pressed into \\"wings\\". Collars were overall very tall and stiffened, with rounded corners. The usual necktie was a narrow four-in-hand. Ascot ties were worn with formal day dress and white bow ties with evening dress. Accessories Silk top hats remained a requirement for upper class formal wear; soft felt Homburgs or stiff bowler hats were worn with lounge or sack suits. Flat straw boaters and fedora hats were acceptable for a wider range of activities than previously, and Panama hats were worn for travel. Gentlemen of all classes, especially the middle and working class often wore the newsboy cap and flat cap.

Children's wear Fashion for children in the 1910s evolved in two different directions, day-to-day and formal dress. Boys were dressed in suits with trousers that extended to the knee and girls' apparel began to become less \\"adult\\" as skirt lengths were shortened and features became more child-focused (Villa 28). The war affected the trends in general, as well (Villa 36). Military influences in apparel for little boys was typical and the lengths of skirts for girls were cut shorter yet because of material rationing (Villa 37). The boys even wore shorts in the winter.

Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, was a close friend of both John and Barbara Cole as early as the 1940s, lived in La Jolla and regularly signed books for the shop. The shop closed in 2005, and the cottage is to be turned into a museum by the La Jolla Historical Society.

Bengen is a retired financial adviser who first articulated the 4% withdrawal rate (\\"Four percent rule\\") as a rule of thumb for withdrawal rates from retirement savings in ; it is eponymously known as the \\"Bengen rule\\". The rule was later further popularized by the Trinity study (1998), based on the same data and similar analysis. Bengen later called this rate the SAFEMAX rate, for \\"the maximum 'safe' historical withdrawal rate\\", and revised it in to 4.5% if tax-free and 4.1% for taxable. Withdrawal rate Bengen conducted a number of empirical simulations of historical market behavior and concluded that a person could \\"draw down\\", withdraw, up to 4 percent annually from their portfolio without fear of outliving their money. He published his research in the October 1994 issue of the Journal of Financial Planning. He is also the author of the book Conserving Client Portfolios During Retirement , where he revised and updated his analysis. He gave a brief updating in . The withdrawal rate has since become a staple of the financial service industry, adopted by several major financial firms. Career=Early life and education A native of Brooklyn, born in 1947, Bengen received a B.S. from MIT in aeronautics and astronautics. He is a co-author of Topics in Advanced Model Rocketry, originally published by the MIT Press in 1973.DSpace@MIT: Topics in advanced model rocketry He worked for 17 years with his family-owned soft- drink-bottling franchise firm in the New York metropolitan area, during which he served tenure as president and COO; the company was sold in 1987. Financial career Following the sale of the family business, Bengen moved to Southern California and began a Certified Financial Planner practice, Bengen Financial Services, earning his certification in 1990 and his master's degree in financial planning in 1993. He ran the firm as a fee-only (no commission) practice for twenty years, then sold the firm and retired in 2013. The Four Percent Drawdown rule Based on his early research of actual stock returns and retirement scenarios over the past 75 years, Bengen found that retirees who draw down no more than 4.2 percent of their portfolio in the initial year, and adjust that amount every subsequent year for inflation, stand a great chance that their money will outlive them. The 4% Rule is sometimes also called the Rule of 300. Criticism of the 4% withdrawal rule include references to its assumption of one's investment portfolio, the differences in historical and current interest rates, as well as the reality that most people's spending habits are not consistently linear.

Club career=Early career Paul grew up in Bluebell and played for Bluebell United as a youngster before being snapped up by Oxford United. He made his league debut as a 16-year-old against Barnsley alongside the likes of Ray Houghton. Byrne played 30 or so games for Oxford but moved to Arsenal where he spent 6 months in the reserve team under George Armstrong without making a first team appearance. Bangor He moved to Northern Ireland and signed for Bangor in the Irish League. He entered Bangor folklore by scoring the winner against Ards in the 1993 Irish Cup Final. This was his 21st goal that season. Celtic This sort of form attracted Liam Brady who took him to Celtic and gave him his debut on 6 October 1993 as a substitute against St Johnstone.Football Heroes He made 28 league appearances in 2 seasons at Celtic and scored 4 goals including two of them in the Old Firm derby. He went out on loan to Brighton & Hove Albion and scored once in 8 appearances for them before returning to Celtic. Southend United In August 1995 he left Celtic and signed for Ronnie Whelan's Southend United side for a fee of ¬£80,000. He began well initially at Southend and impressing Birmingham City enough for them to make a ¬£750,000 bid for him.The Scotsman It was downhill from then on for Paul at the club and they were relegated at the end of his 2nd season at Roots Hall. Glenavon Paul returned to Northern Ireland again and signed for Glenavon where he won another Irish Cup winners medal. Bohemians After playing a few reserve games for Shelbourne, Paul signed for Bohemians in January 1999. Bohs had a disastrous season and only escaped relegation by beating Cobh Ramblers in a relegation play-off. The following season was a different story as Bohs challenged Shelbourne all the way before fading away and finishing 3rd. They also reached the FAI Cup Final under the captaincy of Byrne but lost 1‚Äì0 to Shels. Philadelphia With Byrne's contract having expired at Dalymount Park, he went off to America for the summer months and played in Philadelphia. St Patrick's Athletic He returned to Ireland in time for the beginning of the 2000/01 season and signed for home town club St Patrick's Athletic. Back to Bohemians He only spent a few months at Richmond Park before Roddy Collins came calling again and Paul returned to Bohs just before the transfer deadline. He scored with his first touch on his return (a 20-yard free kick) in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Galway United in February 2001. Byrne went on to play a big part as Bohs won the league title, their first in 23 years. A week later, they completed the Double by winning the FAI Cup but Byrne didn't take part due to being cup-tied for playing in an earlier round for St. Pats. Collins controversially departed in the wake of their success and Pete Mahon became the new man in charge. After getting to the 2nd round of the UEFA Champions League qualifiers, they had a disastrous run of league form which cost Mahon his job. Stephen Kenny came in and Byrne was in and out of the side. Byrne played in the FAI Cup final that season but once again finished on the losing side as Dundalk won 2‚Äì1. Kenny had a clear-out of players after that and Byrne was surplus to requirements. Later career He went on to play for Kilkenny City, Dundalk St James' Gate.and Houston Hurricanes FCBoxscorenews Management career 2009 Hemel Hempstead Town FC International career He was capped at Under-15, Under-16, Under-17, Under-18, Under-21 level and \\"B\\" level for Ireland and was included in numerous full international squad but never made an appearance.

Services currently operate between Liverpool Street station and Chingford.See West Anglia Main Line for more information about the section from Liverpool Street to Clapton Junction. The branch is currently part of the Lea Valley Lines network. Construction and opening By the middle of the 19th century Walthamstow had a population of 5,000 people and was a rural retreat for London businessmen. The nearest railway station was at Lea Bridge and a horse bus service ran from Walthamstow to meet the train services. The 1860s saw the beginnings of suburban development in the area encouraged by a number of developers hoping to attract the middle classes to the area. The Great Eastern Railway (GER) was promoting a scheme in 1864 but this found little favour with one developer James Higham who promoted a competing scheme which would have run from a junction just north of Stratford station. However, by 1867 the GER was in financial difficulties and although construction work had started on the branch it had ceased by 1868. Housing construction was continuing apace and Higham approached the GER board with money to build the line. Time was running out on the 1864 act but parliament extended this and instructed the GER it should build a branch from its main line between Stratford and Tottenham Hale to Walthamstow. The GER managed to raise funds and a single-line branch was built from just north of Lea Bridge station to a temporary station at Shern Hall Street with intermediate stations at St James Street and Hoe Street. Operation=Great Eastern Railway (1870‚Äì1922) In 1870, a line was opened from Lea Bridge Road to Shern Hall Street station (a temporary station located west of the present day Wood Street station) and a shuttle service operated commencing traffic on 24 April 1870. The train service was not operated as a through service and passengers had to change for trains to Bishopsgate station (this was the destination before Liverpool Street opened). The line between Hackney Downs and Church Hall Junction opened on 1 August 1872 and direct services to Bishopsgate commenced as a result. In 1873 the line was extended to a temporary terminus at Chingford (where the engines refilled their tanks from a farm pond). This extension saw the closure of Shern Hall station and the opening of Wood Street and Hale End (since renamed Highams Park). The permanent terminus at Chingford opened on 2 September 1878. It had been planned to extend the line to High Beach and indeed a bill was deposited before parliament in 1882. However Queen Victoria visited Chingford on 6 May 1882 to declare Epping Forest open to the public and opponents of the extension used the possible desecration of the forest as an effective way of stopping the extension in its tracks. Chingford station building In 1885 a curve from Coppermill Junction to Hall Farm Junction gave access from the branch to the West Anglia Main Line. As well as goods traffic this saw match day specials from c1930 for Tottenham Hotspur home games at White Hart Lane. The late part of the 19th century saw significant housing development in the Walthamstow area although Chingford remained largely rural with pleasure traffic being its major source of revenue. In 1894 Hale End was renamed Highams Park (Hale End) on 1 October 1894 and it was around this time that terraced housing started appearing south and west of the station. The arrival of the British Xylonite Company in 1894 saw traffic to and from the goods yard increase (Xylonite is an early form of plastic) In the 1910s it became apparent that severe overcrowding was causing problems and the branch was identified for a series of improvements to enable more services to run. After World War One four new carriage sidings were laid and a new signal box opened at Chingford, carriage sidings and the engine shed facilities at Wood Street were expanded. On 13 February 1919 there was an accident at Wood Street when a passenger train ran into an empty stock train. Five people were injured ‚Äì none seriously. The cause was a signal failure. The new improved passenger services (marketed as the Jazz service) started on 12 July 1920. London & North Eastern Railway (1923‚Äì1947) Although not as susceptible as some suburban lines to competing road and tram transport the Chingford branch saw a decline in passenger traffic in the 1920s. This is partly as industrial developments northwards along the Lea Valley saw employment patterns changing although through the 1920s continuing house building along the route offset this. By 1928 all services were in the hands of the N7 0-6-2T locomotives and LNER Quint Art sets replaced the older GER four wheelers (by 1931). In the mid 1930s the line was resignalled with colour light signaling and this came into use on 30 January 1938. The branch was controlled by signal boxes at Clapton Junction and Chingford intermediate signal boxes closed on this date (although the structures still contained equipment) British Railways (1948‚Äì1994) Following nationalisation responsibility for operating the station fell to British Railways (Eastern Region). The 1955 Modernisation Plan saw the Chingford line as one of several in north-east London identified for electrification - the others being the Enfield Town Line and the Southbury loop as far as Broxbourne. Before this the local MP had described the train service as being run \\"by the most decrepit engines and the most ramshackle rolling stock imaginable\\". Additionally British Railways were having problems retaining staff who were attracted to better paid industrial jobs, so it was clear that to maintain train services that something needed to change. The Chingford line was electrified (to 6.25 kV AC) in the late 1950s, with electric services commencing on 12 November 1960. The section from Stratford to Lea Bridge and thence via the Hall Farm curve was also included in this scheme giving a second route to Chingford (the Liverpool Street to Shenfield line had already been electrified by this point) however the work was started but never completed. Early electric services were formed of Class 305 EMUs but initial technical problems with these saw replacements by Class 302 and Class 304 EMUs. In 1960, the Coppermill Curve was lifted. Steam was occasionally seen on passenger services until the end of 1961 and continued on freight services well into 1962. In 1967, the Hall Farm Curve from Lea Bridge to Hall Farm Junction (near St James Street) was closed to regular traffic although it is possible occasional goods trains ran until the goods yard at Wood Street closed in 1968. Despite being electrified in 1960 it is believed that no electric services ever used the chord. The curve was used in steam days to exchange locomotives between Stratford engine shed and the branch. Hoe Street station was renamed Walthamstow Central station and became an interchange station and the eastern terminus of the Victoria line with London Underground services starting on 1 September 1968. This saw passengers from Chingford and Highams Park changing at Walthamstow for the West End and releasing passenger capacity for the remaining stations in to Liverpool Street. On 20 November 1983, the electric supply was upgraded to 25 kV AC. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways. The privatisation era (1994‚Äìpresent day)  The Railways Act 1993 saw the railway split into two parts with Railtrack being responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure and a series of different companies operating the services. However, before the franchises were let operation was in the hands of independent business units. The first of the private sector operators was the West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) Railway which operated suburban services on the West Anglia Main Line and associated branches. It also operated the suburban services out of Kings Cross and Moorgate stations and its rolling stock was maintained at Hornsey and Ilford depots. It commenced operation in January 1997. On 3 October 2002 Railtrack was bought by Network Rail who became responsible for the infrastructure on the branch. WAGN operated the Chingford branch from January 1997 until 2004 when the Strategic Rail Authority made changes to the franchise arrangements and the line became part of the Greater Anglia franchise which covered the whole of East Anglia. The new franchise was named the \\"one\\" franchise by successful bidder National Express. Walthamstow Central station with original GER style platform awnings The \\"one\\" franchise was renamed National Express East Anglia and continued operation of the branch until 2012. Operation then passed to the Abellio Greater Anglia franchise. On 31 May 2015, the line became part of the London Overground network: a concession controlled by Transport for London and currently operated by Arriva Rail London. Passenger services In 1870 the service operated between Lea Bridge and a temporary service at Shern Hall street station (near Wood Street). From 1872 services from the branch then operated to Bishopsgate station calling at Clapton and Hackney Downs. The following year trains were extended to Chingford. Between November 1872 and January 1874 trains terminated at the newly constructed Bishopsgate (Low Level) and then to Liverpool Street when that station opened. The opening of the spur from Hall Farm Junction to Coppermill Junction in 1885 saw the introduction of a 12 trains per day service to Highgate Road (via South Tottenham) and from 1888 this was extended to Gospel Oak. Patronage was never great (although the route did well on public holidays) and by 1901 suffered from road and tram competition. By the end of 1918 there were only two trains per day (although this reduction may have been a wartime economy measure). This service lasted until 5 September 1926 after which trains only operated on bank holidays although these ended in August 1939. In 1897 services running every half hour throughout the night started to operate between Wood Street and Liverpool Street. These lasted until 1966. From 12 July 1920 a new improved train service was run (known as the Jazz service). Peak hour trains ran at five- minute intervals with one train originating/terminating at Wood Street and the other at Chingford. Peak hour trains consisted of 16 four wheel carriages with 848 seats whilst off peak trains were worked by 6 four wheelers (318) seats. The July 1922 Bradshaws Railway Guide showed the Chingford line service on table 312. During World War Two services generally ran every 10 minutes on the branch. In the 1950s excursions were run from Chingford to destinations including Margate, Hastings and Brighton. the trains were routed into Liverpool Street and then via the former link onto the East London Line. The electrified service which started on 18 June 1962 had trains running every 10 minutes with additional services during the hours. The basic pattern was soon revised to every 20 minutes as much business had by this point been lost to road traffic. In the May 2015 timetable all services call at all stations on the branch plus Clapton, Hackney Downs and Liverpool Street. In the off peak all services call at Bethnal Green which is only served by some services in the peak hours. Trains run every 15 minutes typically taking 26 minutes from Liverpool Street. Goods traffic Goods traffic on the Chingford branch generally emanated from Temple Mills Marshalling Yard and used the Hall Farm Curve to access the branch or from the sidings at Northumberland Park using the curve from the West Anglia Main Line to access the branch. Wood Street, Hoe Street, Highams Park and Chingford all had goods yards. The later two stations dealt with traffic of a more rural nature for many years including milk. By the 1950s following the rise of road transport freight traffic on the branch was largely coal, timber, general merchandise and building materials. As well as coal for the engine shed at Wood Street there was a power station at Hoe Street which was rail served until December 1967. The goods yards closed on the following dates: * Hoe Street ‚Äì November 1964 * Wood Street ‚Äì 6 May 1968 * Highams Park ‚Äì 4 October 1965 * Chingford ‚Äì 4 October 1965 Locomotives Opened by the Great Eastern Railway, operation throughout the steam era was almost exclusively by locomotives built by the GER (or in the early days of operations its predecessors). Passenger operation was almost exclusively in the hands of tank engines with tender engines handling goods traffic. Typical classes that operated the line were: The 'No. 134 Class' 0-4-4T were built in 1872‚Äì1873 specifically at the time Liverpool street opened and more suburban services were being operated by the GER.. Construction of the thirty engines was divided equally between Neilson & Co. and the Avonside Engine Co. They were displaced from Chingford line duties c1900. The GER Class M15 (LNER class F4/5) was a class of 160 2-4-2T steam locomotives designed by Thomas William Worsdell and built between 1884 and 1909. The GER Class R24 was a class of 140 0-6-0 steam tank locomotives designed by James Holden later to become LNER Class J67. A later version of this class the Class S56 numbered 20 locomotives (LNER Class J69). The GER Class L77 (LNER Class N7) 0-6-2T locomotives were designed by the GER (but most examples were actually built by its successor the London & North Eastern Railway. Designed by Alfred John Hill they were employed on suburban passenger services throughout the North East London area between 1915 and 1962. Initially locomotive numbers 7990‚Äì7999 9LNER numbering) were specifically allocated to Chingford branch line services. An N7 0-6-2T which was the mainstay of the passenger service for many years Holden designed the GER Class S44 (LNER G4) 0-4-4T engines of 1898 with the Chingford and Enfield branches in mind. However increasing train weights by the 1920s saw them displaced to rural duties before withdrawal between 1929 and 1938. The GER Class Y14 (LNER Class J15) 0-6-0 locomotives were employed on freight trains on the line. Designed by T.W. Worsdell for both freight and passenger duties they were introduced in July 1883 and they were so successful that new batches were built (largely unchanged) to 1913 the final total being 289. Following the 1960 electrification various classes of Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) took over operation of the line (although initial technical problems saw steam still operating services for a short period). These trains were all allocated to Ilford depot situated on the Great Eastern main line. EMU classes that operated the line included: * British Rail Class 302 * British Rail Class 305 * British Rail Class 306 * British Rail Class 307 * British Rail Class 308 By the 1980s these units were being withdrawn and replaced by more modern stock. Since then the branch has generally been worked by either British Rail Class 315 or British Rail Class 317 EMUs. Carriages All coaching stock that operated the line was either built by the Great Eastern Railway (or its predecessors such as the Eastern Counties Railway) or London and North Eastern Railway. From opening until the mid 1920s coaching stock was four wheeled and even as late as 1900 the majority of GER suburban trains were composed of four-wheeler carriages. Interior design was spartan and around 1900 third- class passengers sat on bare boards five abreast, second-class passengers on cushions also five abreast, while first-class passengers sat four abreast and enjoyed more legroom. In 1899 James Holden produced the first six passengers sat abreast carriages in a 13-carriage, third-class only train (each carriage was 27 feet long and 9 feet wide and had five compartments). This set, which also included such modern features as slam lock doors and gas tail lamps became the model for future suburban carriage design. The GER made every effort to maximise the capacity of its suburban carriages to deal with the rise in usage. In the early 1900s some four-wheeler carriages were cut in half longitudinally and a section inserted to make them wider in order to increase the capacity. By 1915 A. J. Hill instigated a policy of converting old four- wheel carriages into bogeyed stock and some 500 four-wheeled carriages were converted this way. From 1928 LNER Quint-Art sets designed by Sir Nigel Gresley were being deployed on the branch. These were 5-car sets, and the articulated bogies effectively joined the carriages together rather than bogies. In the peak hours these operated as 10-car sets. One unusual passenger working was the 1882 visit of the Great Western Railway royal train on 6 May 1882 for the visit of Queen Victoria. It was hauled by a GER 0-4-4T engine. Other facilities An engine shed was located at Wood Street railway station and this was a sub-shed of Stratford engine shed. It had an allocation of tank engines for suburban use ‚Äì largely class L77 (LNE Class N7) and was closed around the time of electrification. There were also carriage sidings located at Wood Street and at Chingford. , there are still sidings at Chingford used for the stabling of EMU sets. Future developments Longer term the restoration of the Hall Farm Curve has been considered a number of times as it would significantly reduce journey times between the Chingford branch and Stratford. There are no current plans to re-introduce services over this route but it must remain a strong contender for re-opening especially once Crossrail has opened and more platform capacity is available in Liverpool Street station. At various times, stations have been suggested for Chingford Hatch and Forest Road, Walthamstow.

Tuzin (June 14, 1945 - April 15, 2007) was an American social anthropologist best known for his ethnographic work on the Ilahita Arapesh, a horticultural people living in northeast lowland New Guinea, and for comparative studies of gender and sexuality within Melanesia. Tuzin was born in Chicago, Illinois, grew up in Winona, Minnesota, and spent his teen years again in Chicago.Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania Newsletter (November 1996) \\"1997 Annual Meeting Program: Distinguished Lecture: Prof. Donald Tuzin.\\" #96, p. 5. He received his B.A. from Western Reserve University in Ohio (shortly before its merger with Case Institute of Technology), where he became interested in anthropology and participated in the excavation of Native American archaeological sites left by the Mound Builders. He also received his master's degree from Case Western Reserve. While studying at the University of London, Tuzin became interested in Sepik cultures and decided to go to the Australian National University's Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS), where he worked with the famous and controversial social anthropologist Derek Freeman.Tributes to UCSD Faculty Leader Don Tuzin Follow his April 15 Death Tuzin conducted fieldwork among the Ilahita Arapesh in New Guinea's East Sepik Province. He completed his Ph.D. in anthropology at ANU in 1973 and joined the anthropology department at University of California, San Diego that same year. Tuzin's most significant book was probably The Cassowary's Revenge (1997), a study of culture change and the construction and enactment of masculinity. The following summary is taken from the book jacket: :\\"Donald Tuzin first studied the New Guinea village of Ilahita in 1972. When he returned many years later, he arrived in the aftermath of a startling event: the village's men voluntarily destroyed their secret cult that had allowed them to dominate women for generations. The cult's collapse indicated nothing less than the death of masculinity, and Tuzin examines the labyrinth of motives behind this improbable, self- devastating act. The villagers' mythic tradition provided a basis for this revenge of Woman upon the dominion of Man, and, remarkably, Tuzin himself became a principal figure in its narratives. The return of the magic-bearing 'youngest brother' from America had been prophesied, and the villagers believed that Tuzin's return 'from the dead' signified a further need to destroy masculine traditions. The Cassowary's Revenge is an intimate account of how Ilahita's men and women think, emote, dream, and explain themselves. Tuzin also explores how the death of masculinity in a remote society raises disturbing implications for gender relations in our own society. In this light Tuzin's book is about men and women in search of how to value one another, and in today's world there is no theme more universal or timely.\\" In addition to teaching and mentoring students in anthropology, he co-founded (with Fitz Poole) and directed UCSD‚Äôs Melanesian Archive, the world‚Äôs largest depository of unpublished materials on the societies and cultures of Melanesia. Lipset, David, and Paul Roscoe (2004) \\"Fitz John Porter Poole (1941-2002)\\" American Anthropologist, 106(1):219-220. In part because of Tuzin's work, UCSD was known during the 1970s and 1980s as one of the top institutions in the world for the anthropological study of Melanesia. Professor Tuzin was also a professor for Eleanor Roosevelt College's, Making of the Modern World sequence. To augment his lectures, he wrote the book, Social Complexity in the Making: A Case Study Among the Arapesh of New Guinea. Don Tuzin was twice chair of UCSD's department of anthropology, and in 2004-2005 was chair of UCSD's Academic Senate.In Memoriam Don Tuzin In his later years, Tuzin was working on a biography of Derek Freeman in collaboration with Peter Hempenstall, a professor of history at the University of Canterbury, in New Zealand.

December 21, 1926, R√∏nne, Bornholm;About Dr. Lilli Nielsen:CV ‚Ä† June 24, 2013, Kolding, Denmark) was a Danish psychologist in the field of teaching blind children and those with multiple disabilities. She has written several books on the subject. * Are You Blind? - This book focuses on the adult's interactions when working with children/adults with multiple disabilities. The needs of individuals with autistic-like tendencies or who exhibit self-injurious or aggressive behaviors are specifically addressed. The Five Phases of Educational Treatment are presented in detail - a technique used to build trust and encourage skill attainment. * Early Learning Step By Step - Parents, educators, and therapists who work with children and adults with multiple special needs will gain an understanding of how all individuals achieve readiness skills for learning. Environmental intervention can facilitate skill attainment through Active Learning equipment and techniques, including learning to move, coordinate hand movement, learning to chew/eat, dress/undress, and play constructively. * Educational Approaches - This book is a collection of Dr. Nielsen's papers, articles, essays and research ideas. It explains how she expanded the educational approaches for children and infants with vision impairments. * Functional Scheme - This functional skill assessment and learning reassessment tool was developed by Dr. Nielsen to meet the needs of children and adults who are functioning at a developmental level under 48 months. The purpose of the tool is to create the best possible basis for developing an appropriate learning program for the learner. * Space and Self - Dr. Nielsen details the meaning of spatial relations as it applies to the development of self-identity. The development and use of the ‚ÄúLittle Room‚Äù is provided, with particular emphasis on promoting object conceptualization, self-identification and spatial relations in individuals with multiple special needs. * Spatial Relations in Congenitally Blind Infants - This is Dr. Nielsen's dissertation on her scientific study, which resulted in the design of the \\"Little Room.\\" The study investigated whether a specially designed environment would facilitate the development of early spatial relations in congenitally blind infants. * The Comprehending Hand - The ability to grasp is of fundamental importance for a child with special needs to get into contact with his/her surroundings and to enhance the development of the other senses. The book gives practical hints on how to adapt materials and surroundings to stimulate and encourage fine motor skill development. * The FIELA Curriculum ‚Äì 730 Learning Environments - Developed by Dr. Nielsen, The Flexible Individual Enriched Level Appropriate Curriculum offers 730 examples of developmentally appropriate activities for children and adults with multiple disabilities. This book is an \\"appetizer\\" to the thousands of learning environments and activities a child or adult needs to develop and learn to his potential. (An optional Manual with Moveable Cards provides an instantly usable programming option.) She was the second of seven children, four of whom were born blind. When she was seven she was charged with the responsibility of taking care of her blind younger brother.About Dr. Lilli Nielsen She was a preschool teacher, then worked in a hospital, became a psychologist, and eventually was hired to teach the blind. In 1988 she earned a PhD in psychology at the University of √Örhus. Lilli Nielsen has worked as special education adviser at Refsnaesskolen, National Institute to Blind and Partially Sighted Children and Youth in Denmark.An Introduction to Dr. Lilli Nielsen's Active Learning She has been awarded the Knight Order of the Dannebrog. Dr. Lilli Nielsen died on the June 24, 2013, at the public hospital of Kolding after a short period of illness (pneumonia).  Philosophy of Active Learning for Individuals with Visual Impairments  The Active Learning approach emphasizes that all individuals learn best by active participation. All activity, especially in the earliest stages of development, actually \\"wires our brains\\" and establishes critical foundational concepts and skills necessary for all future learning. Individuals with multiple disabilities (cerebral palsy, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, autism, hearing impairment, etc.) are at great risk from developing reliance on others to interact with the world around them. They learn to be a passive rather than active participant, waiting for adults to provide activity rather than seeking it out on their own. Children and adults with special needs often develop stereotypical or aggressive behaviors in order to communicate with others or cope within the environments in which they are placed. Active Learning recognizes that every child/adult with special needs is unique. The programming and intervention for facilitating learning must reflect this individuality. Active Learning emphasizes creating a developmentally appropriate and enriched environment so that children and adults with multiple special needs become active learners. Dr. Nielsen's Active Learning approach addresses the breakdowns that can occur at the earliest stages of development due to an individual's inability to access the world because of disabilities including visual impairment, cerebral palsy, cognitive disabilities, hearing impairment, autism and other disabilities. \\"Little Room\\" One of her most famous ideas is that of the \\"little room.\\" This is a box that is laid over a blind or severely disabled child that has toys and other stimuli hanging from it. The child can then explore and play with the toys. Most will vocalize, even for the first time, due to the superior acoustics of the Little Room. As Nielsen wrote: \\"The purpose of the 'Little Room' is to facilitate blind children's achievement of spatial relations and reaching behaviour, but it can also be of considerable help for sighted low functioning children.\\"Nielsen, L. (1992). Space and Self. Copenhagen, Denmark: Sikon Press {multiple image Child in \\"Little room\\" thumb } \\"HOPSA-dress\\" The HOPSA-dress provides vertical orientation, without the need for weightbearing, to children with multiple disabilities. Items with interesting textures can be placed near the feet for tactile stimulation. Later, the pulley system can be adjusted so that the child can bear weight gradually, at their own pace. { HOPSA-dress 200px } ReferencesExternal links *LilliWorks Active Learning Foundation *http://www.activelearningspace.org/ Category:1926 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Bornholm Category:Educational psychologists Category:Danish psychologists ","title":"Lilli Nielsen"},{"id":"10899797","text":"Olivia Giacobetti (born 1966) is a French perfumer. She has an independent line called Iunx and has also created fragrances for Diptyque, L'Artisan Parfumeur, Guerlain, and Herm√®s, among other lines. She is particularly known for a refined style as well as innovation such as her novel use of fig in perfumery, popularizing the note beginning in the mid-1990s. She is among the perfumers who became prominent in a late-20th and early-21st-century turn toward the \\"nose\\" behind the scent and independent lines that foreground these creators, a shift away from perfumes sold by fashion labels or celebrities in other fields. Early life Olivia Giacobetti was born in 1966. Her father Francis Giacobetti is an artist.Verner, Amy (2011) \\"Blotting paper 2.0: Have you sniffed perfume on driftwood lately?\\", The Globe and Mail, 4 June 2011 Olivia Giacobetti was first drawn to perfumery at nine years old when she saw the Jean-Paul Rappeneau film Lovers Like Us, in which Yves Montand played a perfumer.  Career  Giacobetti began working in perfumery for Annick Goutal when she was 16 years old. She joined French fragrance and flavor firm Robertet the following year and worked there for seven years as an assistant perfumer. Giacobetti started her own company, Iskia, in 1990,Hamilton, Denise (2011) \\"Found In Translation: Olivia Giacobetti uses her sensory alchemy to make scents of memories\\", LA Times, March 2011, retrieved 26 June 2011 then aged 24. Working out of a garden-laboratory in Paris's ninth arrondissement, she began taking commissions from lines like L'Artisan Parfumeur, Diptyque, and Herm√®s. In March 2003, backed by Japanese cosmetics conglomerate Shiseido, Giacobetti started her own line of perfumes as well as candles and body products, called Iunx. Located in a large boutique at 48‚Äì50, rue de l‚ÄôUniversit√© in Paris that Giacobetti developed with her father Francis, the original ambition was to create 60 scents, but the line struggled to find an audience and closed after two years. However, beginning in 2006 Iunx products were made available in a boutique in H√¥tel Costes in Paris, where Giacobetti had also created the house signature scent in 1995, one of the first hotels to make such a commission. In 2016, Giacobetti opened a new Iunx boutique at 13, rue de Tournon in Paris. In 2017, Giacobetti developed a line of five candles in collaboration with the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Style and impact on perfumery Giacobetti drew recognition early in her career for developing the use of fig as a note in perfume, particularly in 1994 fragrance Premier Figuier for L'Artisan Parfumeur and the 1996 Philosykos for Diptyque (the line's best- seller), both scents inspired by the fig tree; numerous other lines followed suit with fig fragrances of their own in the latter part of the decade. In Perfumes: The Guide, Luca Turin writes, \\"Premier Figuier was the fragrance that put Olivia Giacobetti on the map, and deservedly so: its fig-leaf note...was an overdue natural in perfumery, and pleasantly jarring.\\" Among Giacobetti's best-known creations is En Passant, a subtle but innovative floral fragrance that combines lilac with notes of wheat and cucumber to evoke spring rain on fresh flowers. In The Guide, Turin's co-author Tania Sanchez calls En Passant \\"a perfect example of Olivia Giacobetti's tendency...a fine white-on-white painting.\\" Launched in 2000 by French niche perfume line Editions de Parfums Fr√©d√©ric Malle, the fragrance was part of a turn toward the recognition of the perfumer behind the scent, with Malle including not only the name of the perfume and brand on his bottles' labels, but also the \\"nose\\" who created the fragrance. In turn, Giacobetti is among the perfumers who have raised the profile and sales of such independent and niche perfume lines, where (with a few exceptions) fashion labels and celebrity licensees previously dominated the perfume market. En Passant was featured in a 2017 exhibit on contemporary perfumery at Somerset House in London. Giacobetti also received acclaim for her 1999 creation L'Artisan Parfumeur Dzing!, a scent inspired by Paris's Cirque d'Hiver. Discussing Dzing! in The New York Times, Chandler Burr called the perfume \\"one of the most innovative, authentically strange scents of the past two decades\\", managing to combine diverse aromas of sawdust, circus animals, caramel apples and more into \\"a comforting, subtly succulent mix.\\" Burr writes: \\"Dzing! plays subtle purity against subtle power; it's fresh without green (a trick that takes serious perfumer talent to pull off), sweet without sugar (ditto), warm and soft like a plank of newly sawed pine still warm from the blade.\\" Turin gave the perfume five stars in The Guide, saying \\"Olivia Giacobetti is at her imaginative, humorous best, and Dzing! is a masterpiece.\\" Giacobetti's scents are generally mixed-media, employing both natural and lab-developed synthetic ingredients. She describes these elements as \\"indissociable\\", with potent synthetic ingredients providing the fragrance's \\"spine\\" and natural ingredients adding \\"nuances\\". An exception to Giacobetti's mixed-media practice are her fragrances for Honor√© des Pr√©s, an all-naturals line. Personal life Giacobetti lives in Paris. She has a daughter, born in 1996.

In 2004, Rusty Eye relocated to Los Angeles, California, United States. Rusty Eye has also been the backing band for the rock en espa√±ol solo musician Sergio Arau since 2015. History Rusty Eye was formed in 1995 in Mexico City, Mexico. The band's original lineup consisted of Mr. Rust (born Pablo Armando Salido Casanova) on bass and vocals, 'Dr. Eye' on guitars and vocals, Daniel Acosta on drums, and Ken Harrington on lead vocals. The quartet previously went by the name of 'Scarecrow' in 1993 and 'Poltergeist' in 1994. The name 'Rusty Eye' relates to the \\"corrosion of perception\\". After cutting several independent DIY demos they had previously done, the band recorded their first LP titled 'Rust N‚Äô Roll' in 2000. This album was released in Mexico in 2001 and in the United States in 2003, through the band's own indie label, 'Epoche Records'. Miss Randall (born Julieta Randall) joined in 2003, replacing Haze on drums. The band relocated to Los Angeles, California, United States, in 2004. The band's second production 'Cryogenic' began in 2005 with guitarist Jonny Dee. In 2006, Dee was replaced with the guitarist Baron Murtland. Rusty Eye was awarded the 'Best Metal Single of the Year' award for the single \\"Mr. Cannibal\\" by the L.A. Music Awards in 2006 and were listed in the Trade Magazine 'Music Connection' Top 100 Unsigned Artists of 2006. In December 2006, Murtland took a hiatus from Rusty Eye and was replaced with several live session guitar players, the most notable being Jehu (a.k.a. Jay) from the Metalcore band 'Tomorrow Comes Today'. Jehu appeared as the guitarist and played \\"The Chef\\" in the \\"Mr. Cannibal\\" music video. In September 2008 Murtland returned to Rusty Eye. On June 6, 2009, the band released the Possessor album, which blended different metal styles and sounds, and had a horror film influence. On December 12, 2010, Rusty Eye celebrated the 15th Anniversary of the band with the release of a live CD titled 'Live at The Rainbow MMX'. The live performance was recorded in April 2010 and Rusty Eye became the first band to record a live album at the Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood, CA. The album was produced by Miss Randall and was recorded with the band's mobile studio with the help of engineer Yuri Anysonian. On February 28, 2014, Rusty Eye released 'Saca el Cobre', an LP in Spanish, for the first time in their career. It included cover songs from Mexican rock en espa√±ol artists from 1988 to 1992. It also includes two re-recorded versions of Rusty Eye's 'Mr. Cannibal': one an English-language remake, the second a Spanish run-through renamed 'Sr. Canibal'. The announcement of Miss Randall's departure from the band coincided with the release of the album. On February 10, 2015, Rusty Eye announced a collaboration with solo Rock en Espa√±ol artist Sergio Arau, along with the return of Miss Randall. They re-recorded a song from Arau‚Äôs first solo album named 'No me late la tira (Ni me latir√°!)', which was digitally released as a single through Arau‚Äôs own label 'Calaca'.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Fa≈Çk√≥w. It lies in the northwestern corner of historic Lesser Poland, approximately west of Ko≈Ñskie and north-west of the regional capital Kielce. In 2006 the village had a population of 1,100. Fa≈Çk√≥w had the status of a town from 1340 to 1869, when, like many other former towns in Poland, it lost that status after the January Uprising. The history of the village dates back to the 13th century, when it belonged to the influential Odrowaz family. Some time in the first half of the 14th century, the family changed its name to Falkowski, and in 1340, King Kazimierz Wielki allowed Jakub and Piotr Falkowski to turn the village into a town, based on the Magdeburg rights. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Fa≈Çk√≥w belonged to the County of Opoczno, Sandomierz Voivodeship. The town had several owners, and remained very small, with population of as little as 140 (as for 1662). After the Partitions of Poland, Fa≈Çk√≥w in 1815 became part of the Russian- controlled Congress Poland. In the early 19th century, a blast furnace was opened here, as the village was located in the Old-Polish Industrial Region. Following the January Uprising, Fa≈Çk√≥w lost its town charter (1869). During World War I, the village together with its ancient church was destroyed. Fa≈Çk√≥w has ruins of a 17th-century defensive manor house, which was destroyed shortly after completion, during the Swedish invasion of Poland.

He was among the founders of Vienna Secession and co-establisher of the Wiener Werkst√§tte. His most famous architectural work is the Palais Stoclet, in Brussels, (1905‚Äì1911) a pioneering work of Modern Architecture, Art Deco and peak of Vienna Secession architecture.  Biography =Early life and education Hoffmann was born in Pirnitz / Brtnice, Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic), Austria-Hungary. His father was modestly wealthy, the co-owner of a textile factory, and mayor of the small town. His father encouraged him to become a lawyer or a civil servant, and sent him to a prestigious upper school, but he was very unhappy there. He later described his school years as \\"a shame and a torture which poisoned my youth and left me with a feeling of inferiority which has lasted until this day.\\" In 1887 he transferred instead to the Higher School of Arts and Crafts State in Brno / Br√ºnn beginning in 1887 where he received his baccalaureate in 1891. In 1892 he began his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Karl Freiherr von Hasenauer and Otto Wagner, two of the most prestigious architects of the period. There he also met another rising architect of the time, Joseph Maria Olbrich. In 1895, Hoffman, together with Olbrich, Koloman Moser and Carl Otto Czeschka and several others, founded a group called the Siebener Club, a forerunner of the future Vienna Secession. Under Wagner's guidance, Hoffman's graduation project, an updated Renaissance building, won the Prix de Rome and allowed Hoffmann to travel and study for a year in Italy. The Vienna Secession (1897‚Äì1905) Upon his return from Italy in 1897, he joined Wagner's architectural firm, and in the same year he joined the new movement launched by Wagner, Gustav Klimt, and others; the Society of Austrian Fine Artists, better known as the Vienna Secession.Pg. 79, Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture: A Critical History. Thames & Hudson. 1980, 1985, 1992. He immediately went to work on the design of the Secession Building, the first gallery of the movement, designing the foyer and the office, and planning the first exhibitions in the building. He wrote his first manifesto for the Secession at this time, calling for buildings which were stripped of useless ornament. \\"It is not a matter of overlaying a framework with ridiculous ornament in molded cement, made industrially, nor imposing as a model Swiss architecture or houses with gables. It is a matter of creating a harmonious ensemble, of great simplicity, adapted to the individual... and which presents natural colors and a form made by the hand of an artist...\\" In his writing, Hoffmann did not entirely reject historicism; he praised the model of the British Arts and Crafts Movement, and urged artists to renew local forms and traditions. He wrote that the basic elements of the new style were authenticity in the use of materials, unity of decor, and the choice of a style adapted to the site. In 1899, at the age of twenty-nine, he began to teach at the Kunstgewerbeschule, now University of Applied Arts Vienna. He designed the Vienna arts exhibition for the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition, which exposed the Secession style to an international audience. In 1899, he also designed the Eighth Exposition of the Secession, one of the most important exhibitions it, due to its international participants. In addition to works by Secession artists, it featured works by the French artist Jules Meier-Graefe, the Belgian Henry van de Velde, The Scottish Charles Ashbee, and especially the works by the Scottish designers Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh from Glasgow. This exhibit included a group of model houses in the Hohe-Wart neighborhood of Vienna which displayed features of Arts-and-Crafts movement, including windows divided in small squares, and the gable roof. During this period, Hoffmann's work became more rigorous, more geometric, and less ornamental. He favored the use of geometric forms, especially squares, and black and white surfaces, explaining later that \\"these forms, intelligible to everyone, had never appeared in previous styles\\". He was in charge of designing the frequent exhibits held in the Secession gallerias, including the setting for Gustav Klimt's celebrated frieze devoted to Beethoven. File:Beethovenfries (1902).jpgInstallation by Josef Hoffmann of the Beethoven Frieze by Gustav Klimt in the Secession Building (1902) File:Josef hoffmann per w. m√ºller, mobiletto per fotografie, vienna 1902 ca.jpgCabinet for photographs (circa 1902) The Wiener Werkst√§tte (1903‚Äì1932) Hoffmann was married in 1898 to Anna Hladik, and they had a son, Wolfgang, born in 1900. He was extremely occupied with Paris Exposition of 1900, and the other exhibitions in Vienna. During this period, he built only a small number of buildings, including the transformation of a house for his friend Paul Wittgenstein. He also built several town or country houses for his colleagues and friends, as well as a Lutheran church and a house for the pastor in St. Aegyd am Neuwald, in lower Austria. In 1903, along with Koloman Moser, and banker Fritz W√§rndor, who provided most of the capital, he launched a much more ambitious venture, the Wiener Werkst√§tte, an enterprise of artists and craftsmen working together to create all the elements of a complete work of art, or Gesamtkunstwerk.Vienna Secession history by Senses-ArtNouveau.com including architecture, furniture, lamps, glass and metal work, dishes and textiles. Hoffmann designed a wide variety of objects for the Wiener Werkst√§tte. Some of them, like the Sitzmaschine Chair, a lamp, and sets of glasses are on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.MoMA.org  The Collection  Josef Hoffmann. (Austrian, 1870-1956) and a tea service in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.All Josef Hoffmann: Tea service (2000.278.1-.9)  Works of Art  Timeline of Art History  The Metropolitan Museum of Art All the works were designed and hand-made by the artisans of the group. Some of Hoffmann's domestic designs can still be found in production today, such as the Rundes Modell cutlery set that is manufactured by Alessi. Originally produced in silver, the range is now produced in high quality stainless steel. Another example of Hoffmann's strict geometrical lines and the quadratic theme is the iconic Kubus Armchair. Designed in 1910, it was presented at the International Exhibition held in Buenos Aires on the centennial of Argentinean Independence known as May Revolution. Hoffmann's constant use of squares and cubes earned him the nickname Quadratl-Hoffmann (\\"Square Hoffmann\\"). Hoffmann's style gradually became more sober and abstract and his work was limited increasingly to functional structures and domestic products. The workshop concept flourished in its early years and spread. In 1907, Hoffmann was co-founder of the Deutscher Werkbund, and in 1912 of the √ñsterreichischer Werkbund (or Austrian Werkbund). But the workshop ran up against the First World War and then the Great Depression, which hit Germany and Austria especially hard. It was forced to close in 1932.

It was a distinct move away from the arts and crafts style, as a major precedent and inspiration for the modern architecture that would develop in the first half of the 20th century,Pg. 81, Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture: A Critical History. Thames & Hudson. 1980, 1985, 1992.

It is a visible turning point from historical styles to modern architecture. It was built for Adolphe Stoclet, the heir of a wealthy Belgian banking family, who had lived in Milan and Vienna, and was familiar with the Vienna Secession. Hoffmann presented the plans in 1905, but the construction, in three stages, was not completed until 1911. The exterior is extraordinarily modern, in strict geometric forms, with touches of decoration. It is covered in white Norwegian marble, while the edges of the forms and the windows are bordered with sculpted metal. The central tower, nearly twenty meters high, is made of assembled cubic forms and crowned with four copper statues with statuary. The plan has two axes, perpendicular to each other. The railings around the building and on the tower have had stylized ornamental designs, and even the plants in the garden are sculpted into geometric forms to complement the architecture. The interior, by Hoffmann and the artists of the Wiener Werkst√§tte, is like a series of stage sets, offering carefully planned views from one room to the other, and decorated with colorful mosaics made by Klimt, as well as walls of white marble and antique green marble. The floors are made of parquet from exotic woods, with different designs in each room. The dining room features a set of two mosaic murals by Klimt, in a setting of marble columns and mosaics by Klimt, along with geometric marble columns and walls covered with stylized floral patterns designed by Hoffmann and Klimt. Every detail of the house, including the rectangular while marble bathtub, surrounded by marble plaques with sculpture and placed on a blue marble floor; the polished pallisander wood paneling in the bedroom, and the kitchen counters, floor and furniture, were made by the Werkst√§tte and planned to harmonize with the overall design. The building is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Wittgenstein was an important patron of the arts, and provided funding for the construction of the Secession House in Vienna. The hunting lodge has rustic exterior but an extremely modern interior; the interior walls are paneled with exotic woods in geometric patterns, with gilded decorative elements. Every element, from he dishes to the chairs and parquet floor, was carefully harmonized and proportioned. The antechamber was decorated by the Werkt√§tte, and features paintings by Carl Otto Czeschka, ceramics by Richard Luksch, and painting on glass attributed to Koloman Moser. A more modest but colorful creation of Hoffmann was the interior of a popular avant-garde night club, the Fledermaus Caberet in Vienna (1907) made with the help of the Vienna Werkst√§tte. The walls and counters were covered with white plaster and or multicolor tiles, while the floors had a checkerboard pattern of black and white. It was designed, following the Werkest√¢tte doctrine, as a total work of art, from the furniture and dishes to the light fixtures, menus, tickets and posters. Hoffmann designed the Fledermaus chairs, which became a symbol of the style. Other important works include the Hochstetter House in Vienna (1906‚Äì1907); and the Villa Ast in Vienna (1909‚Äì1911) which was constructed for Eduouard Ast, a businessman and building contractor who pioneered the use of reinforced concrete in Austria, was a major funder of the Werkst√§tte. The house built of reinforced concrete, encrusted with decoration and sculpture. It was strongly vertical, it was sited atop a stone pedestal that contained the basement, and featured a modern interpretation of a classical facade. It had a loggia with windows on one side, looking out at the garden, which connected with a gallery giving access to the garden, decorated with winding water basins made of concrete. Like the Palais Stoclet, the interior was decorated with fine veined marble plaques of a different colors, and with a colorful painting by Klimt. In 1911‚Äì1912 Hoffman was engaged by Moriz Gallia, a major patron of the Werkst√§tte, to design the interiors of the five main rooms of his new apartment, including all furniture, rugs, and light fittings. Much of the furniture, mostly in richly carved, ebonised wood with boldly coloured upholstery, survives in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, as the Hoffmann Gallia apartment collection. Another major work was the Villa Skywa-Primavesi (1913‚Äì1916), also in Vienna, for the industrialist Otto Primavesi. This was a veritable palace, 1000 square meters not counting the adjoining buildings, placed in a park of and was built in the neoclassical modern style, all in white, that Hoffmann favored during this period. The frontons of the building featured sculptures by Anton Hanak. The interiors were in the same modernized neoclassical style, decorated with parquet floors of rare woods, marble plaques on the walls, and sculptural decoration.

The first was a country house for Eduard Ast at Velden am Worthersee in Corinthia. It was in a simpler geometric style, with white walls, cubic forms, and just a touch exterior decor, s classical pediment over the front door with topped with statuary. The second project was a villa for Sonya Knips, famous as the model for one of Klimt's earliest works. She had married the industrialist Anton Knips, who was a major patron of the Werkst√§tte. This house was different from the others, less geometric in its facade and showed the inspiration of the British Arts and Crafts Movement in its roof and dormer windows. The interior featured a perfect harmony of furniture, wall decoration and detail, and was originally highlighted complemented by three major Klimt paintings, now in museums. In the 1920s, Hoffmann became particularly interested in building public housing and apartment buildings for working-class residents, to relieve the severe housing shortage after the War. His first such project was in Klosehof, a wealthy neighborhood in Vienna. This was a square building five stories high, sixty meters by sixty meters, with a central courtyard, in which he planned a tower six stories high, with more apartments and, on the ground floor, a day care center for children. The facade was simple, covered with white plaster. The only decorative details were simple columns and pediments over the entrances, and a gabled roof, red trim around the windows. As the economic crisis of the 1930s deepened, Hoffmann built more public housing in Vienna. The largest project was at Laxenburgerstrasse 94, built between 1928 and 1932. It contained 332 apartments, each with a small balcony, organized in a block six-story buildings around a central courtyard. This simple, functional structure became a model for similar buildings built in Vienna and other cities after the War. Hoffmann had been a founding member of the Austrian Werkbund, founded in 1914, modeled after the celebrated German Werkbund. He organized several exhibitions for the Werkbund, experimenting with modern architecture. In 1930‚Äì32, the Austrian Werkbund created an experimental city, modeled after the German \\"White City\\" version created at Suttgart in 1928. For the Exposition, Hoffmann designed four different houses, of different sizes and designs, all simple and practical. They were made of brick covered by plaster. One innovative feature added by Hoffmann was a glass-enclosed stairway on the exterior of each house, which made the interior of the house larger and gave variety to the facade. Another modern feature, borrowed from Corbusier, was a roof terrace on each residence.

The building was of an extreme simplicity, in a U form, with one side slightly longer than the other. The walls were made of crepi in horizontal stripes. The original entrance portal and sculptural decoration designed by Hoffmann were never made due to budget difficulties, but their absence added to the final priority of structure. The building was unused after 1938, when Nazi Germany took over Austria, but was restored in 1984 to its original appearance. File:Biennale Venedig, Austria Pavillon, Josef Hoffmann 1.jpgAustria Pavilion for the Venice Biennale (1934) Later Years (1939‚Äì1956) In 1936 became Professor Emeritus at the Fine Arts, essentially retired, though he continued to work with his earlier students. In 1937 he presented a model interior, \\"The Boudoir of a great actress\\", at the Paris International Exposition of 1937, and designed new interiors for the Hotel Imperial in Vienna. In 1940, he redesigned the interior of the Meissen factory and offices in Vienna. After Nazi Germany forced Austria to unite with Germany, he redesigned the former German Embassy in Vienna to serve as new headquarters of the German Army in Austria. During the War, he made more than eighty projects for houses and other buildings, but there is no record if any were constructed. In 1945, following the War, Hoffmann rejoined the Vienna Secession, the artistic movement that he, Klimt and Otto Wagner had dramatically quit in 1905. He was elected President of the Secession from 1948 to 1950. Between 1949 and 1953, based on his experience before the War, he designed three large public housing projects in Vienna. He died on May 7, 1956, at the age of eighty-five, at his apartment at 33 Salesianergasse in Vienna.  Teaching at Kunstgewerbeschule  Although he said little to his students, Hoffmann was a highly esteemed and admired teacher. He tried to bring out the best in each member of his class by means of challenging assignments, which were occasionally work on real commissions.Lillian Langseth Christensen: A Design for Living. Vienna in the Twenties, 1987 Where he detected talent among young artists he was willing or eager to promote it; Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele and Le Corbusier were the most prominent beneficiaries of his benevolence towards a promising next generation; others strongly influenced by his aesthetic included the American designers Edward H. and Gladys Aschermann and Louise Brigham. German designer Anni Schaad was another of his students. Le Corbusier was offered a job in his office, Schiele was helped financially and Kokoschka was given work in the Wiener Werkst√§tte. As a member of the international jury for the competition to design a palace for the League of Nations at Geneva in 1927, Hoffmann belonged to the minority who voted for Le Corbusier's project, and the latter always spoke with admiration of his Viennese colleague. Hoffmann had voted for the union of Austria with Germany and, as noted in Tim Bonyhady's \\"Good Living Street. The fortunes of my Viennese family\\" (2011), the architect was admired by the Nazis who appointed him a Special Commissioner for Viennese Arts and Crafts and commissioned him to remodel the former German embassy building into the \\"Haus der Wehrmacht\\" for army officers. Following its use by the British Government from 1945 to 1955 it was demolished. Hoffmann died in Vienna, aged 85.  Critical reception and posthumous reputation  His international exhibition work helped to make his name widely known, and many distinguished contributors to the Festschrift on his 60th birthday acclaimed him as a master. Honours bestowed on him included the cross of a commander of the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur and the Honorary Fellowship of the American Institute of Architects. The critic Henry-Russell Hitchcock in 1929 wrote, \\"In Germany as well as in Austria, Hoffmann‚Äôs manner has profoundly influenced the New Tradition\\". Only three years later, however, when he published The International Style together with Philip Johnson, Hitchcock no longer mentioned Hoffmann's name. Siegfried Giedion in his influential Space, Time and Architecture did not do justice to Hoffmann's oeuvre because it would not fit easily into his polemically simplified version of architectural history. Despite honours and praise on the occasions of Hoffmann's 80th and 85th birthdays, he was virtually forgotten by the time of his death. Although his true stature and contribution were acknowledged by such masters as Alvar Aalto, Le Corbusier, Gio Ponti and Carlo Scarpa, the younger generation of architects and historians ignored him. The process of rediscovery and reappraisal began in 1956 with a small book by Giulia Veronesi, and gained momentum during the 1970s with a number of exhibitions and smaller publications. In the 1980s several monographs were published and major exhibitions held. Imitations of his style also began to appear, and replicas of his furniture, fabrics, and of some objects he had designed became commercial successes, while original pieces and drawings from his hand fetched record prices in the auction-rooms.  Legacy in America  Josef Hoffmann's son, Wolfgang Hoffmann, together with his father's former student Pola Weinbach Hoffmann (later Pola Stout), emigrated to New York in 1925 and made significant contributions to American modernism.Wilson, Richard Guy; Pilgrim, Dianne H.; Tashjian, Dickran; Brooklyn Museum (1986).

Along with the nearby village of Tuckton, it originally formed a tithing in the Hundred of Christchurch, before becoming part of the Civil Parish of Southbourne in 1894. The latter was incorporated into the Borough of Bournemouth in 1901. Etymology and early settlement The village name derives from the Old English wƒ´c, meaning \\"dairy farm\\".Popplewell, p. 4. The village is mentioned in the ministers' accounts for the Manor of Christchurch in 1301, at which point the king (as Lord of the Manor) could claim the second-best sheep from every customary fold in Wick (there being at that time six folds), while the tenants in return were allowed pasture in the \\"demesne arable land\\" outside the ditch of Hengistbury.Popplewell, p. 4. There are two references to a \\"Manor of Wick\\" in the Christchurch Cartulary, a series of charters drawn up by the monks of Christchurch Priory. The first comes in 1331 in a survey of splotgabulum, a type of land tax payable to the clergy. From this, we learn that the Manor of Wick contained 276 acres of arable land, a messuage taxed at one shilling per year, and a dovecote which had grown dilapidated during the reign of Edward II, and had fallen down.McKinstry, p. 12. The second reference comes in 1406 when we read that, on 13 October that year, a large fish (\\"uni magno piscis\\"), 18 ft. long, had been washed up at \\"La Bournemowthe\\" and taken to the Manor of Wick, where it was cut into forty pieces. Four days later, Canon John Leye ventured across from the Priory and was handed four portions of the fish as tithe. This, incidentally, is the earliest known reference to Bournemouth as a toponym.McKinstry, p. 12. Listed buildings Wick House, 78-84 Wick Lane Wick today contains a number of Grade II listed buildings, among them Riverside Cottage, a high-pitched thatched cottage adjoining Wick Ferry, and Wick House, a substantial red-brick property almost opposite - probably built in the late eighteenth century for Richard Hughes, a noted informant on local smugglers and the owner of Tuckton Farm.McKinstry, pp. 24-5. He put the property up for sale in 1784, when it was described as a \\"modern ... dwelling house in good repair\\",The Salisbury & Winchester Journal, 22 March 1784; vide McKinstry, p. 25. but there were no takers. The property was successfully auctioned in 1792 when it was purchased by the Sloman family, who eventually over-reached themselves by purchasing several breweries in Somerset; in 1891, John Sloman the Third was adjudged bankrupt with debts of ¬£11,487 13s. 1d.McKinstry, p. 29. By this point, Wick House had been put into trust, and thus remained occupied by the Slomans until it was sold and divided into four maisonettes in the 1950s.'Wick, 1958', http://www.royhodges.co.uk/Wick.pdf Accessed 2015-12-24 Further down towards Wick Green, there are more listed cottages including two whitewashed brick and slate properties, 'Quality' and 'Tranqility' (sic): the former was used as a retreat by the music-hall star Ella Shields in the 1930s, while the latter housed a tea-room and village shop, run by a Mrs. Knaggs, into the 1950s.'Quality & Tranquility, Wick Green, Wick Village', https://www.streets- of-bournemouth.org.uk/view/image/item/quality__tranquility/7387. Accessed 2015-12-24 Not far from these properties, in the middle of Wick Green itself, are two grass-choked flagstones covering a well, which was used by villagers into the 1930s.McKinstry, Alex, 'The Well on Wick Green', http://www.royhodges.co.uk/The%20Well%20On%20Wick%20Green.pdf. Accessed 2015-12-24 Ecology Wick Fields form an important part of the Hengistbury Head Nature Reserve and constitute a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Hengistbury Head, Wick Fields and adjacent land were declared a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) on 18 May 1990 under Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The meadows here have not been improved for agriculture and are therefore regarded as ‚Äòancient grassland‚Äô, rich in flowering plants and rushes. An increase in birds has been reported here, including the rare Dartford warbler and the Cetti's warbler. Other birds include the song thrush, skylark, kestrel, barn owl and little owl. The otter is seen here occasionally, as is the now 'uncommon' water vole. A herd of Galloway cattle graze the land; these cattle are ideally suited to the harsh conditions of the coast and estuary and help manage the land by chewing and trampling down any overgrowth. Wick Ferry terminal, 1900 Wick Ferry Ferryman at Wick, postmarked 18 February 1913. The ferryman is probably John O'Brien (c. 1847-1929). There has been a passenger-ferry from Wick across the Stour to Christchurch since about 1815, when it was set up to give employment to a farm labourer named Marshall, who had become unfit for farm work after being kicked in the thigh by a horse.McKinstry, p. 66. It was operated by punt until 1947 when outboard engines were added to the ferry-boat, after which crossings began to be made in half the time.McKinstry, p. 148. The service was discontinued for a short period in 1957. ReferencesBibliography McKinstry, Alex, The Village of Tuckton, 35,000 B.C. - 1926 (Christchurch: Natula Publications, 2015).

It was directed by Kurt Maetzig, and stars G√ºnther Simon, Julius Ongewe and Yoko Tani. The film was first released by Progress Film in East Germany, running 93 min.An entry about Der Schweigende Stern and DEFA film database (retriever October 27, 2018) Variously dubbed and cut versions were also released in English under other titles: First Spaceship on Venus, Planet of the Dead, and Spaceship Venus Does Not Reply. After finding an ancient, long- buried flight recorder that originally came from a spaceship, apparently from Venus, a human spaceship is dispatched to Venus. The crew discovers a long- dead Venusian civilization that had constructed a device intended to destroy all life on Earth prior to invasion. Before they could execute their plan, they perished in a global nuclear war. Plot In 1985, engineers involved in an industrial project to irrigate the Gobi Desert accidentally unearth a mysterious and apparently artificial \\"spool\\". When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator, intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a \\"cosmic document\\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold- blooded message of destruction. With this new information the crew decides to transmit the information to earth, believing that the information would help mankind and not cause panic. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that could bring panic to mankind. With the ship's robot, Omega, German astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small information storage devices that look like insects. Brinkmans landing craft is destroyed in an explosion due to landing on high tension power lines. The rest of the crew lands the Cosmostrator to investigate the explosion. The Crew splits some stay at the Cosmostrator to study the storage devices while the others follow the power line to try and find the Venusians. But they find no Venusian life forms. Instead they find a large golf ball-like structure that Arsenew suggests may be a giant transformer unit, or a force-field generator. Following the power lines in the other direction, they find the remains of a deserted and blasted city centered around a huge crater, signs of a catastrophic explosion so intense that shadowy forms of humanoid Venusians are permanently burned on to the walls of the surviving buildings similar to the nuclear shadows left by the Hiroshima bombing. The Venusians are gone, but their machines remain functioning, including the radiation-bombardment machine intended for Earth. One of the scientists accidentally triggers the weapon, leading to a frantic effort by the team to disarm it. Tchen Yu lowers Talua, the ship's communication officer, into the Venusian command center. When Tchen Yu's suit is punctured, Brinkman ventures out to save him. Before he can reach Yu, Talua succeeds in reversing the weapon. Unfortunately, this also reverses Venus' gravitational field, flinging Cosmostrator into space. Brinkman is also repelled off the planet, beyond the reach of the spaceship, while Talua and Tchen Yu remain marooned on Venus. The surviving crew members must return to Earth, where they warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons.

It turns out he was one of the two first black men to travel in space (in the movies). Another one, in the same year of 1960, was Archie Savage in an Italian film Space-Men.\\"Who Was the First Black Man in Space - In the Movies That Is?\\", by Sergio Mims, April 20, 2017 (retrieved April 12, 2020) Production The story is based on the 1951 science fiction novel The Astronauts by Stanis≈Çaw Lem. Lem was approached by Kurt Maezig who worked with DEFA in 1957 who had the Idea to make a film adaptation of his novel. Possibly because Lem was widely known in Poland and abroad at the time. The Astronauts was likely chosen due to the recent advancements in rocket technology and the popularity of space travel in science fiction. The story also expressed many socialist Ideals Which would have looked good for the state owned DEFA. The DEFA director Herbert Volkmann responsible for finance, as well as other officials of the GDR, were strict with the project, and had idealogical concerns about the script, and new writers were brought to work on it, eventually resulting in twelve different versions of the script. In the film's original East German and Polish release the Earth spaceship sent to Venus is named Kosmokrator. The film was shot mostly in East Germany. The outdoors scenes were shot in the area of Zakopane, Poland and the airfield of Berlin-Johannisthal and special effects in Babelsberg Studio and in a studio in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. The spaceship mock-up at the airfield was a matter of a newspaper hoax in Der Kurier : the front page presented it as a failed attempt at spaceflight in the Soviet occupation zone.\\"RAUMFAHRT - Die Ost-Venusier\\", Der Spiegel, June 24, 1959 (retrieved 2017-09-22) The film was noted for early extensive usage of \\"electronic sounds\\" on its soundtrack. Electronic music and noises illustrated the work of the computer that deciphers the alien message, the message itself, and the eerie landscape of Venus devastated by the nuclear catastrophe. Markowski, who produced the musical score, was assisted by sound engineer Krzysztof Szlifirski from the Experimental Studio of Polish Radio, with some sound effects added at the laboratory of the Military Academy of Technology in Warsaw and with post-production at DEFA.Off the Planet: Music, Sound and Science Fiction Cinema, p.11 was in charge of special effects. Release It was the first film released by Poland and East Germany. When first released to European cinemas, the film sold about 4.3 million tickets,List of the 50 highest-grossing DEFA films. making it one of the 30 most successful DEFA films. Critical response In a retrospective on Soviet science fiction film, British director Alex Cox compared First Spaceship on Venus to the Japanese film The Mysterians, but called the former \\"more complex and morally ambiguous\\". Cox also remarked that \\"Silent Star's images of melted cities and crystallised forests, overhung by swirling clouds of gas, are masterpieces of production design. The scene in which three cosmonauts are menaced halfway up a miniature Tower of Babel by an encroaching sea of sludge may not entirely convince, but it is still a heck of a thing to see\\". Stanislaw Lem, whose novel the film was based upon, was extremely critical of the adaptation and even wanted his name removed from the credits in protest against the extra politicization of the story when compared to his original.MILCZƒÑCA GWIAZDA, filmpolski.pl (retrieved 2017-09-22) (Lem: \\"It practically delivered speeches about the struggle for peace. Trashy screenplay was painted; tar was bubbling, which would not scare even a child\\".)\\"Filmowe ≈õwiaty Stanis≈Çawa Lema\\", citing Lem's interview from the book Thus Spoke... Lem (Wayback Machine archive of the relevant section) Awards *1964: Festival of Utopian Films, Triest (Utopisches Filmfestival Triest): \\"Golden Spaceship Award\\" (\\"Das goldene Raumschiff\\") Other releases=United States First Spaceship On Venus In 1962 the shortened 79-minute dubbed release from Crown International Pictures substituted the title First Spaceship on Venus for the English- speaking market. The film was released theatrically in the U.S. as a double feature with the re-edited version of the 1958 Japanese Kaiju film Varan the Unbelievable. All references to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima were edited out. The American character Hawling became a Russian named Orloff. The Russian character Arseniev became the American Herringway, while the Polish character Soltyk became the Frenchman Durand. Two differently cut and dubbed versions of the film were also shown on the American market at the time, Spaceship Venus Does Not Reply and Planet of the Dead.Off the Planet: Music, Sound and Science Fiction Cinema, p. 27 The original, uncut version of the film was finally re- released in the U.S. in 2004 under its original title The Silent Star by the DEFA Film Library of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\\"The Silent Star (Der schweigende Stern)\\", DEFA Film Library In other media In 1980 a short sequence from First Spaceship on Venus was used as a \\"film-within-a-film\\" in the low budget feature Galaxina. In 1990 the film was featured in the second season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and was released on DVD in 2008 by Shout! Factory, as part of their \\"MST3K 20th Anniversary Edition\\" collection. In 2007 the film was shown on the horror hosted television series Cinema Insomnia. Apprehensive Films later released the Cinema Insomnia episode on DVD.

Biography Bass attended Harvard University, graduating in 1744. He taught and preached in Congregationalist churches, then went to England to be ordained by the bishop of London in May 1752. He had been appointed assistant at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1749 by the new rector, Matthias Plant, St. Paul's Church, Newburyport, Mass. whom he followed as rector in 1753, serving until his death in 1803. Bass considered himself neutral during the American Revolution, but since he omitted from the church service all reference to the royal family and the British government, he was accused by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts of supporting the colonists and lost his financial support. In May 1789, the first convention of the Diocese of Massachusetts, meeting in Salem, elected Bass bishop of Massachusetts and Rhode Island but his parish rejected the election because lay delegates did not participate. In 1796 in Boston, Bass was unanimously re-elected bishop of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine, with lay participation, and was consecrated in Philadelphia on May 7, 1797. He also oversaw the churches in New Hampshire and is listed by the Diocese of Rhode Island as its second bishop. Edward Bass was the 7th bishop consecrated for the Episcopal Church. Aged 71 at the time of his consecration, he is the oldest person consecrated bishop in the Episcopal Church. Bass died on September 10, 1803, just before he was to travel to Portland, Maine.

A patron of chivalry and minnesang, Bernhard's reign marked the emergence of the Carinthian duchy as an effective territorial principality. Family In 1122 Bernhard's ancestor Count Henry of Sponheim, descending from Rhenish Franconia, had inherited the Imperial estate of Carinthia. Upon his death in the following year, he was succeeded by his younger brother Engelbert, Bernhard's great-grandfather. His father was Duke Herman of Carinthia, who had reigned from 1161 until 1181. He was at first succeeded by Bernhard's elder brother Duke Ulrich II, who reigned for two decades but died childless on 10 August 1202, whereafter Bernhard succeeded him. His mother was Agnes of Austria (c. 1151/54 ‚Äì 13 January 1182), a member of the House of Babenberg. Reign Bernhard had actually been regent over the Carinthian duchy since his elder brother Duke Ulrich II had fallen seriously ill, possibly with leprosy, after he had joined the Crusade of 1197. In the conflict between the rivaling House of Hohenstaufen and the Welfs around the German throne upon the death of Emperor Henry VI, he originally continued his brother's support for their Hohenstaufen relative Philip of Swabia but turned to the Welf Otto IV after Philipp's assassination in 1208 and attended his coronation in Rome. Bernhard again switched sides to Philip's nephew Frederick II, who had been elected King of the Romans in 1212 and finally prevailed. Bernhard remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. He backed the efforts by Grand Master Hermann von Salza to reach a reconciliation between Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX and sealed a 1230 peace agreement in the church of San Germano. He later also intermediated in the conflict between the emperor and his rebellious son King Henry VII; in 1237, he supported the election of Henry's younger brother King Conrad IV. However, in his later years, having established marital relationships with the Bohemian P≈ôemyslid dynasty and the Counts of Andechs, he turned away from straitened Frederick II towards the ultramontane party. In 1247 he achieved the election of his younger son Philip as Archbishop of Salzburg. Bernhard von Spanheim fountain, Klagenfurt A territorial prince (princeps terre) at his own judgement, Bernhard concentrated on regional politics and aimed at extending his estates against rivalling territorial princes like Patriarch Berthold of Aquileia or the Bishops of Bamberg controlling the city of Villach and important trade routes to Italy, albeit without much success. Moreover, the Salzburg archbishops were able to strengthen their position by establishing the suffragan dioceses of Seckau and Lavant in 1218 and 1225 respectively, while the duke picked a long-time quarrel with Count Meinhard III of Gorizia around the small Greifenburg estates. In turn, Bernhard entrenched a ducal centre of force comprising the city triangle of Sankt Veit, where he established a mint in 1205, V√∂lkermarkt, and Klagenfurt, the later Carinthian capital that he had transferred to its present location in 1246. Bernhard's court in Sankt Veit was the site of festive chivalrous tournaments and a venue of minnesingers like Walther von der Vogelweide. In his Frauendienst poem, Ulrich von Liechtenstein renders his arrival in Carinthia in the guise of a Venus in 1227, when Duke Bernhard received him with the Slovene salutation Buge waz primi, gralva Venus (\\"God be with you, royal Venus\\"). Bernhard's hopes to extend his influence after the extinction of the Austrian Babenberg dynasty in 1246 were disappointed. Nevertheless, he gained control over the strategically important Loibl Pass and Seeberg Saddle, leading through the Karawanks mountain range to the adjacent March of Carniola in the south, where his son Ulrich III in 1248 became margrave (dominus Carniolae) upon his marriage with Agnes of Andechs, daughter of Duke Otto I of Merania. He is also credited as founding the Kostanjevica (Landstra√ü) Cistercian Abbey in Lower Carniola about 1234. Bernhard is buried at St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal. Marriage and children ducal coat of arms until 1246 Carinthian coat of arms from 1246 Duke Bernhard's exalted rank corresponds to his wedding with Judith, daughter of the P≈ôemyslid King Ottokar I of Bohemia and the √Årp√°d princess Constance of Hungary, in 1213. Four known children result from the marriage: *Ulrich III (c.1220-1269), Duke of Carinthia 1256-1269, Margrave of Carniola since 1248 *Bernhard of Carinthia (d. before 1249) *Margaret of Carinthia (d. before 1249) *Philip of Spanheim (d. 21/22 July 1279), Archbishop of Salzburg from 1247 to 1256 and Patriarch of Aquileia from 1269 to 1273. The relationship with the P≈ôemyslid dynasty became crucial, when Bernhard's son Duke Ulrich III died without heirs in 1269. His younger brother Philip was claimant to the estates of Carinthia and Carniola, he nevertheless could not prevail against his first cousin King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who in 1268 had signed an inheritance treaty with late Duke Ulrich. Though Philip even reached his enfeoffment by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany in 1275, he could not assume the rule after King Ottokar II was killed at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.

Service history After sailing through the Panama Canal to San Diego and taking on supplies, she departed for Pearl Harbor, and then to Eniwetok Lagoon where she remained from 21 June to 16 July 1944 repairing damaged ships in that area. On 17 July, she joined a task unit bound for Guam where she effected repairs to vessels, and thereafter proceeded to Saipan, Tinian, Leyte Gulf, Lingayen Gulf, Kerama Retto, and Okinawa, rendering her vital repair services to the ships of the fleet damaged by weather and battle. Following a period of overhaul, in June 1945 she proceeded to Saipan and returned to Pearl Harbor where she converted LCIs for service as transports. Following decommissioning, she was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet in January 1947. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register and turned over to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for disposal, she was sold by MARAD on 1 June 1980. Egeria was scrapped in 1980.

In the United Kingdom and Singapore, there is no legal requirement to appoint a counting agent. At elections in the Republic of Ireland, counting agents are called tallymen; they keep track not only of first-preference votes but also of transfers. The number of counting agents which can be appointed is determined by the returning officer of the election and is usually dependent on the number of counting clerks at the count. Counting agents are appointed after the period when nominations to the election are made. The election timetable will state when counting agents have to be appointed, typically a week before polling day. The role of the counting agent is to oversee the count itself, though they may not touch any of the ballot papers and must act through the returning officer. During counts, generally only the candidate, the candidate's partner and the candidate's counting agents may enter the place where counting takes place.

The primary purpose of a polling agent is to assist in detection of personation. The appointment of a polling agent is not legally required. Polling agents are appointed after the period when nominations to the election are made. The election timetable states when counting agents have to be appointed, usually about a week before the polling day. Only one polling agent per candidate may be admitted at any one time to a polling station, and they may not take information out of the polling station. After the May 2005 Northern Ireland elections, the Electoral Commission concluded that some polling agents unlawfully acted as tellers, identifying those who had not yet voted, and passing information from inside the polling place to other party workers. This information is not normally available to parties unless voters give it voluntarily to tellers, outside the polling place.

With Jedediah Smith, he led a trapper band that discovered South Pass, Wyoming; however, before that Robert Stuart led the first known white party through the South Pass. He shepherded the first two emigrant wagon trains to Oregon, including the Bartleson-Bidwell Party in 1841. He was the official guide to John C. Fremont on his second, and longest, expedition in 1843‚Äì44. He guided Col. Stephen W. Kearny and his Dragoons along the westward trails in 1845 to impress the Native Americans with their howitzers and swords. Fitzpatrick helped negotiate the Fort Laramie treaty of 1851, at the largest council ever assembled of Native Americans of the Plains. He spoke Native American languages and deeply respected them as well. Among the most colorful and highly regarded of mountain men, Fitzpatrick was also party to many of the most important events in the expansion of the West. In 1849, Fitzpatrick married Margaret Poisal, an Arapaho woman and the niece of Arapaho Chief Niwot. Poisal served as an important translator for the Arapaho peoples and often worked alongside Fitzpatrick at important meetings. After his death, Poisal served as the official interpreter for the Arapaho during the Little Arkansas Treaty Council in 1865. In the winter of 1853‚Äì54, Fitzpatrick went to Washington, D.C., to see after treaties that needed to be approved, but while there contracted pneumonia and died on February 7, 1854.The New Encyclopedia of the American West, ed. Howard R. Lamar. Yale University Press (1998) He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery there. In the 1966 episode \\"Hugh Glass Meets the Bear\\" of the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, the actor Morgan Woodward was cast as Fitzpatrick. John Alderson played Hugh Glass, who after being mauled by a bear and abandoned by Fitzpatrick crawled two hundred miles to civilization. Victor French was cast as Louis Baptiste, with Tris Coffin as Major Andrew Henry. Fitzpatrick appears to have been confused or conflated with John S. Fitzgerald, who, according to the Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, was actually the one who left Glass behind. In 2004, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Books *Hafen, LeRoy R. and Ghent, W.J., Broken Hand.

He left Givaudan in 1976 with two others perfumers for Lautier in Grasse. In 1983, he joined Givaudan Paris as chief perfumer and Roure-Givandan and then he worked at Haarmaan & Reimer in Paris (which merged in 2003 with Dragoco to form Symrise).

Biography The son of American missionaries, Haskell was born in the Ottoman Empire, in the Balkan city of Monastir, now Bitola in the Republic of Macedonia. After returning to the United States, he graduated from Oberlin College in 1923. Shortly after this he became an editor at a national Student magazine, The New Student. In 1927, he joined the editorial staff of the New York City-based magazine Creative Art. He was the architecture critic of The Nation from 1929 until 1942, and was twice the associate editor of Architectural Record, in 1929-1930 and from 1943‚Äì1949. He wrote for numerous other publications, including the English journal Architectural Review and Harper's Magazine. In 1949, he became the editor of Architectural Forum, a post he held until his retirement in 1964. Under his editorship, the magazine published some of the early work of Jane Jacobs, whom Haskell hired as an associate editor in 1952. Not only one of the noted champions of modern architecture in 1920s America, he was also a proponent of modern urban design, and became a friend of planners such as Clarence Stein and Henry Wright and fellow critic Lewis Mumford. Haskell was also an adjunct professor at Pratt Institute and at Columbia University. Although not an architect himself, he was admitted as a member of the American Institute of Architects. His papers are held at Columbia University's Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library. He was the elder brother of scientist Edward Haskell.

DCHP is a historical usage dictionary of words, expressions, or meanings which are native to Canada or which are distinctively characteristic of Canadian usage though not necessarily exclusive to Canada. The first edition was edited by Walter S. Avis (ed.-in-chief), C. Crate, P. Drysdale, D. Leechman, M. H. Scargill, C. J. Lovell, and published in 1967 by W. J. Gage Limited. DCHP-1 was published after a period of about 12 years, and had a sizeable collection by C. J. Lovell at its base. W. J. Gage Publishers, the leading dictionary publisher for Canadian English (CanE) dictionaries at the time, contributed to the project (P. Drysdale was employed by Gage).Scragill 1967. Preface to DCHP-1. http://www.dchp.ca/DCHP-1/pages/frontmatter#preface In this way, the first edition (DCHP-1) was the result of both academia and a publishing house. More importantly, however, the academic partner, headed by editor-in-chief Walter S. Avis, were given free hand. The result, despite all monetary constraints and pre-computer editing techniques, was a ground-breaking dictionary in several ways: the DCHP-1 was the first scholarly historical dictionary of a variety of English other than British English (see OED) or American English (DAE, DA) (Dollinger 2006), the two dominant varieties of English throughout the 20th century. Meanwhile, other varieties of English have become the focus of historical dictionary projects: Australian (Ramson 1988), South African (Silva 1996), and New Zealand (Orsman 1997). In 2006, after more than 40 years of existence without any updates, work on a new edition was started. Nelson Education Ltd., which acquired Gage Ltd. and with it the rights to the DCHP-1 had been actively seeking collaborators in academia to produce a new edition of the DCHP-1. This project, DCHP-2, was proposed at a conference on Canadian English in January 2005, Abstract of panel discussion. and formally commenced at the University of British Columbia's Department of English in August 2006, after a year of preparatory work. Since 2009, DCHP-2 has had no association with Nelson Ltd. or any other publisher and had been a purely academic project. Milestones Completed in 2011 after automatic scanning and manual proofreading by a team of UBC students under the direction of Stefan Dollinger, DCHP-1 was republished in open access as of 2013, thanks to Nelson Ltd. (Dollinger et al. 2013), and is available as a free website, DHCP-1 Online. DCHP-2, fully revised and expanded, is published 2017 (thanks to a three-year SSHRC Insight Grant, Competition 2012, Insight Grants).; 2nd ed. 2017 in Canadian Literature  Release of DCHP-2  DCHP-2, the second, reconceptualized and updated edition was released online on 17 March 2017. The launch coincided with the 57th anniversary of Charles J. Lovell's passing, the founding editor of DCHP-1. DCHP-1 was launched as a Centennial project; DCHP-2 was launched as a Sesquicentennial contribution with the goal of lifting the discussion about Canadianisms, and about Canadian English more generally, on an empirically sounder footing.

Simulation software allows for modeling of circuit operation and is an invaluable analysis tool. Due to its highly accurate modeling capability, many colleges and universities use this type of software for the teaching of electronics technician and electronics engineering programs. Electronics simulation software engages its users by integrating them into the learning experience. These kinds of interactions actively engage learners to analyze, synthesize, organize, and evaluate content and result in learners constructing their own knowledge. Simulating a circuit‚Äôs behavior before actually building it can greatly improve design efficiency by making faulty designs known as such, and providing insight into the behavior of electronics circuit designs. In particular, for integrated circuits, the tooling (photomasks) is expensive, breadboards are impractical, and probing the behavior of internal signals is extremely difficult. Therefore, almost all IC design relies heavily on simulation. The most well known analog simulator is SPICE. Probably the best known digital simulators are those based on Verilog and VHDL. Some electronics simulators integrate a schematic editor, a simulation engine, and on-screen waveform display (see Figure 1), allowing designers to rapidly modify a simulated circuit and see what effect the changes have on the output. They also typically contain extensive model and device libraries. These models typically include IC specific transistor models such as BSIM, generic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transformers, user defined models (such as controlled current and voltage sources, or models in Verilog-A or VHDL-AMS). Printed circuit board (PCB) design requires specific models as well, such as transmission lines for the traces and IBIS models for driving and receiving electronics.Figure 1. right Types While there are strictly analog Mengue and Vignat, Entry in the University of Marne, at Vallee electronics circuit simulators, popular simulators often include both analog and event-driven digital simulationP. Fishwick, Entry in the University of Florida capabilities, and are known as mixed-mode simulators.J. Pedro and N. Carvalho, Entry in the Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal This means that any simulation may contain components that are analog, event driven (digital or sampled-data), or a combination of both. An entire mixed signal analysis can be driven from one integrated schematic. All the digital models in mixed-mode simulators provide accurate specification of propagation time and rise/fall time delays. The event driven algorithm provided by mixed-mode simulators is general purpose and supports non-digital types of data. For example, elements can use real or integer values to simulate DSP functions or sampled data filters. Because the event driven algorithm is faster than the standard SPICE matrix solution, simulation time is greatly reduced for circuits that use event driven models in place of analog models.L. Walken and M. Bruckner, Event-Driven Multimodal Technology Mixed-mode simulation is handled on three levels; (a) with primitive digital elements that use timing models and the built-in 12 or 16 state digital logic simulator, (b) with subcircuit models that use the actual transistor topology of the integrated circuit, and finally, (c) with In-line Boolean logic expressions. Exact representations are used mainly in the analysis of transmission line and signal integrity problems where a close inspection of an IC‚Äôs I/O characteristics is needed. Boolean logic expressions are delay-less functions that are used to provide efficient logic signal processing in an analog environment. These two modeling techniques use SPICE to solve a problem while the third method, digital primitives, use mixed mode capability. Each of these methods has its merits and target applications. In fact, many simulations (particularly those which use A/D technology) call for the combination of all three approaches. No one approach alone is sufficient. Another type of simulation used mainly for power electronics represent piecewise linearP. Pejovic, D. Maksimovic, A new algorithm for simulation of power electronic systems using piecewise-linear device models algorithms. These algorithms use an analog (linear) simulation until a power electronic switch changes its state. At this time a new analog model is calculated to be used for the next simulation period. This methodology both enhances simulation speed and stability significantly.J. Allmeling, W. Hammer, PLECS piece-wise linear electrical circuit simulation for Simulink Complexities Process variations occur when the design is fabricated and circuit simulators often do not take these variations into account. These variations can be small, but taken together can change the output of a chip significantly.

Because Ares was historically depicted as one of the archenemies of the DC superheroine character Wonder Woman, most of his issue are frequently portrayed as her opponents, although a few would play a more benevolent supporting role in her self-titled comic book series. Although their DC comics counterparts were never depicted as such in published comic books, Antiope and Hippolyta (the mother of Diana Prince a.k.a. Wonder Woman) are daughters of Ares in classical Greek mythology. Overview Deimos Golden Age In the Golden Age adventures of Wonder Woman, when Ares was primarily known by his Roman name Mars, his chief deputies were his sons: the Duke of Deception, the Earl of Greed, and Lord Conquest who assisted the Axis powers from the planet Mars using their astral powers, (also Count Conquest). Deception's daughter Lya also fought Wonder Woman. Of these, the Duke of Deception became a major recurring foe of Wonder Woman, appearing into the Silver Age as well. Wielding his own powers of illusion, Deception was also responsible for enlisting Doctor Psycho in his first engagement with Wonder Woman. He became ruler of Mars after convincing some slaves to rebel against the God Mars. Modern Age After the Golden and Silver Ages, the Duke of Deception made only a handful of appearances. In one adventure during the period when Wonder Woman had given up her powers, Ares used Deimos, Phobos, and Eris in a battle against the Amazons for the power to dominate every dimension of creation. Post-Crisis In 1985 DC Comics introduced a storyline called Crisis on Infinite Earths. This storyline erased all previous writings of their characters and re-introduced new versions of each character in their place. Charles Moulton's vision of deception, greed, and the will to power being the precursors of war was set aside in favor of versions closer to the myths of Deimos, Phobos, Eris, Harmonia, and Eros. All five are parented by the Olympian war god Ares and the Olympian love goddess Aphrodite. Aside from Harmonia and Eros, the remaining children of Ares are enemies of the Amazons in the Wonder Woman comic book. They were re-created by writer George P√©rez. Fictional character biographies=Deimos Deimos is the Greek god of terror. His Roman counterpart is both Formido and Metus. In the comics, Deimos is depicted with snake-like hair where he does his fear projections through the poisons in the mouths of his snake-like hair. He and his brother Phobos attacked Wonder Woman early on during her mission in Man's World. During that encounter the Amazon was able to behead Deimos with her tiara.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #5 (June 1987) His spirit later took possession of the Batman villain Joker.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #164 (January 2001) Once Ares discovered Deimos and several other of his dead children had escaped Tartarus, Ares set things right returning Deimos back to the Underworld.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #167 (April 2001) =DC Rebirth= After the events of DC Rebirth, Deimos was reintroduced as the twin of Phobos. Together, Deimos and Phobos kidnapped Veronica Cale's daughter, and coerced Cale to aid them in locating Themyscira. They believed that they could not discover the island due to their godhood. This led to Cale's associate Adrianna Anderson becoming Doctor Cyber.Wonder Woman #16 (February 2017) Phobos Phobos is the Greek god of fear and horror. His Roman counterpart is Timor. After an initial attack on Wonder Woman ending with the decapitation of his brother Deimos, Phobos later sent Ixion and Euryale to attack the Amazon out of revenge.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #24 (December 1988) The plot failed and he was imprisoned to Tartarus by Hermes. The witch god Circe later freed Phobos and convinced him to aid her during the events of the War of the Gods. This ended in his death. He later joined his brother Deimos and sister Eris in spirit in escaping Tartarus. Together they possessed the bodies of various Batman villains, in Phobos case the villain Scarecrow. He was later returned to the Underworld by his father Ares. It was Phobos who initially created the monster Decay, mixing his power with that of Medusa's carcass. =DC Rebirth= After the events of DC Rebirth, Phobos was reintroduced as the twin of Deimos. Together, Deimos and Phobos kidnapped Veronica Cale's daughter, and coerced Cale to aid them in locating Themyscira. They believed that they could not discover the island due to their godhood. This led to Cale's associate Adrianna Anderson becoming Doctor Cyber. Eris Golden Apple. Eris is the goddess of strife and chaos, and is the creator of the Golden Apples of Discord famously written in the story of the Trojan War. Her Roman counterpart is Bellona. In ancient myth she is also identified with the Greek goddess Adrestia. When Queen Hippolyta agreed to open her country of Themyscira to the outside world, Eris used the Golden Apples of Discord to make the various United Nations dignitaries fight among one another. Wonder Woman was able to defeat Eris but the event caused a negative outlook to the Amazons by the outsiders and Eris' plans thus stayed on her side despite her defeat. Eris was later killed by the Son of Vulcan during the War of The Gods storyline. Her spirit resurfaced years later as part of a plot engineered by her also dead brothers Phobos and Deimos to merge Gotham City with the Areopagus, Ares' throne capital. Eris possessed the super villain Poison Ivy while her brothers possessed the Joker and the Scarecrow. They were later defeated by the combined efforts of Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, Troia, Wonder Girl, Nightwing, Artemis, and the Huntress. =The New 52= In The New 52, a very different version of Eris appears in a recurring role for the relaunched Wonder Woman ongoing series. Now known as Strife, her physical appearance is drastically different from the pre-Flashpoint incarnation of the goddess; instead of a hideous visage, she appears as a scantily clad young woman in a heavily torn cocktail dress with purplish-pink skin, and white hair styled as a crew cut. Although she reprises her traditionally antagonistic role with Diana, Strife is depicted as less overtly evil compared to her previous incarnation; she is simply a deity who draws sustenance from incidents of discord, and revels in the chaos which result from escalations in conflict. Harmonia Harmonia is the Greek goddess of harmony and concord. Her Roman counterpart is Concordia. Due to being the daughter of Ares, she was physically ugly and became a bitter goddess, constantly wailing at her father's home, the Areopagus. She longed to access the beauty that comes with being a child of Aphrodite.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #2 Through the kindness of Wonder Woman she was able to bring forth her inner beauty. Because of this she became a close supporter of the Amazon and would aid her when able. It was through Harmonia's help that Wonder Woman was able to defeat Ares before he could destroy the world. Harmonia was later killed during the War of the Gods storyline by her brother Phobos. Eros Eros is the Greek counterpart to the Roman Cupid. He is also tied to the Greek gods Anteros and Erotes. Eros is the male equivalent to his mother, Aphrodite, but to a much lesser extent. Whereas Aphrodite has dominion over all aspects of love, Eros tends to gravitate his hold over sudden love, lust and the erotic. He was rarely shown in the Wonder Woman comic series before the New 52 reboot; on one notable occasion however, his father Ares convinced him to shoot a lust arrow at Zeus, who was watching the Amazon Artemis of Bana-Mighdall bathing in a scrying pool. This angered Hera who toppled the floating island of Themyscira during her jealous confrontation of her husband. In the post- Flashpoint continuity, Eros is depicted as a steadfast ally of Wonder Woman. He agreed to take her and her friends to meet Hephaestus, and aid her in dealing with the machinations of the other Olympian gods in the wake of the power struggle over the vacant throne of Mount Olympus. He would lend his pistols, which cause the people they shoot to fall in love, to Diana for her mission to rescue Zola's baby Zeke from Hades. Diana makes a barter with Hades, exchanging Zola for Eros' pistols. Hades agrees and hands over Zola to Diana and Hermes. As they exit Hell, Hades shoots the pistols at Diana, who is shot through her heart, and bound to stay in Hades. Zola, who is desperate to help Diana, is taken back forcefully by Hermes. He would later travel to the Underworld with Hephaestus and Lennox Sandsmark to rescue Diana. She would later gain her freedom by manipulating Hades into staring at his own reflection in a mirror before firing a bullet from the pistols, which bounced off the mirror, struck Hades and compelled him to fall in love with himself. Eros would make his stand with Diana, her allies and the remaining Olympian gods when the villainous First Born began his campaign to take Mount Olympus once and for all. Lyta Milton Lyta undergoing combat training in Themyscira. Lyta Milton is the biological daughter of Ares and Circe, who hid herself under the identity of a mortal named Donna Milton. As Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth could see through any disguise, Circe cast a spell on herself to truly believe she was Donna until an opportune moment presented itself where she could destroy the Amazon. As Donna Milton she believed herself to be a lawyer working for a Boston crime boss named Ares Buchanan. Unbeknownst to Donna, Ares Buchanan was really the Olympian god Ares in disguise as well. The two formed a sexual relationship once she agreed to help Ares defeat Wonder Woman, who was interrupting his illegal business dealings. After becoming pregnant Donna informed Ares that she was going to have his child. Ares showed Donna that he wasn't interested in fatherhood by shooting Donna in the chest. Because of a weapon used shortly thereafter, a mini-black hole was created that seemingly destroyed Ares and caused the building to fall on top of Donna and Wonder Woman. They fell through to the sewers below and landed in a huge underwater pool. The shock of the shooting and the black hole caused Donna to go into premature labor. Wonder Woman helped calm Donna and deliver her baby.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #84 Ashamed that she previously aided Ares in destroying Wonder Woman after sacrificing her own life to save her, Donna named her newborn daughter after Wonder Woman's mother Hippolyta, or \\"Lyta\\". Wonder Woman helped to get Donna back on her feet so that she could properly care for Lyta by hiring her to be the company lawyer for a detective agency she and friend Micah Rains newly established. This arrangement worked nicely for some time until Wonder Woman was able to discover that Donna was really Circe. Once this happened, Lyta's blonde hair and blue eyes changed to resemble more of her mother's features: purple hair and purple/red eyes. Reclaiming her true identity and angered that she would allow herself to become a close friend of Wonder Woman, albeit in a different persona, Circe took to attacking Wonder Woman more frequently. During each attack Circe had Lyta present to better show her daughter how to better destroy her enemies. To this end Circe allied herself with many evil and ruthless villains such as Sebastian Ballesteros, Lex Luthor, Doctor Psycho, and the Silver Swan.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #175 Despite being surrounded by unsavory characters at such a young age, Lyta's personality remained sweet and friendly. She even took to waving hello to Wonder Woman when she would see her. On one occasion Circe had Lyta hide in the shadows and watch as Circe and Wonder Woman beat each other mercilessly. Confused and frightened for her mother's welfare, Lyta began crying and ran to her mother's side for comfort. Circe as angry with Lyta for not following her orders to stay hidden but Wonder Woman verbally chastised Circe to see the situation for what it was: a moment when her child needed her to be a true role-model and to comfort her child. Circe grudgingly agreed and disappeared while holding Lyta, telling her everything is going to be okay.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #176 When Wonder Woman's homeland of Themyscira was revamped to include a rehabilitation island for prisoners, Circe is captured and held there. So that she could not use her magics to escape she is surrounded by the plant Moly, which is the one substance that nullifies Circe's sorceries. Lyta is then taken to be raised on the main island along with many orphaned children. Though Lyta has trouble bonding with the other children on the island,Wonder Woman vol. 2 #186 she does become quite close to several Amazons and takes pleasure in being trained in the Amazon way.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #212 After the Amazon Io teaches Lyta how to properly respect the god Poseidon and his domain, Lyta's father Ares appears.Wonder Woman vol. 2 #218 He incapacitates Io and steals Lyta stating that he means to raise his daughter on his own terms. When Circe learns what has happened she escapes her prison and confronts Ares. Ares tells Circe that the time of the gods is at a crossroads and that drastic measures needed to be taken. Circe agrees to join Ares as his consort, making them new co-rulers of the Underworld. Thus, Lyta continued to be cared for by both of her parents, reunited. Crow Children Created by Gail Simone and Bernard Chang and first appearing in Wonder Woman Vol 3 #39, the five begotten children of Ares and the Amazons came to being when the God of War had also magically impregnated five Amazons at some point in the past, and the offspring of these unholy unions were named Adder, Goat, Rat, Scorpion and Spider. A civil war situation arose on Themyscira, overshadowing the pregnancies, the mothers reached term abnormally quickly and were mystically summoned to a forgotten court by the ghost of Ares. This long abandoned place had been built millennia before just in case children were ever born on Themyscira. Ares further summoned animals infused by his essence. After the five Amazons gave birth against their will, they were magically forced into an eternal sleep. The infants were raised by the magically corrupted animals, and grew up at an accelerated rate. Thus mere months later the five brothers, looking to be about seven years old and having about thrice the maturity, were sent out in the world to turn it against Wonder Woman and the Amazons. The boys have a supernatural ability to influence those around them, overriding their mind with thoughts of violence, hatred, war and guilt. They can easily trigger riots and incite large crowds to deadly violence. By focusing this ability on a single person they can take direct control, even against persons with a strong personality such as Etta Candy, Steve Trevor or Power Girl. The Crow Children act by talking, though it's clearly not normal social interaction - their words have an impossibly convincing effect when it comes to seeding hatred, resentment, envy, defiance and the like. Victims will even experience mild hallucination as a result of dissonance, for instance perceiving a trusted ally as demonically deformed to try to reconcile the words of the Crow Children about that person with reality. The five brothers, wearing a sort of school uniform with cap emblazoned with a crow symbol, strolled through Washington D.C., where Wonder Woman then lived. Using supernatural influence they fanned the flames of intolerance, envy, petty hatred and bloodlust. They both attacked Wonder Woman's reputation and the civil peace in the capital, triggering murders, arson and eventually riot. When the mighty heroine Power Girl responded, the Crow Children were delighted, taking over her mind and turning her against Wonder Woman. The five half-brothers affected a style and speech patterns well beyond their apparent years. They act more like preps highly educated, mannered and articulate with an emphasis on what is proper and how society should behave. They constantly use sarcasm, denouncing violence and improper behavior around them and the lack of morality of modern society while fully knowing that they are the direct cause for the chaos and hatred that surround them. Part of their schtick is to sound very sheltered, like an irate old man writing strongly-worded letters to a newspaper editor about the world of today and all of its perceived shortcomings. Their schtick about how the world is terrible and brutal and exposes youths to the most unseemly sights and behaviors is not constant. They are also good actors, particularly when it comes to manipulating everyone around them and playing on their apparent status as innocent and very proper children. The boys ended up being defeated by Wonder Woman who used her Lasso Of Truth to see through their illusions. Instead of the planned conclusion to the story, in which the boys turned into demonic versions of their animal spirits, causing further havoc in the streets, the issue ended anticlimactically with Wonder Woman giving them a spanking. However the original planned ending alludes to them having powers to transform into large animal demons. In other media * Deimos appeared in the 2009 animated film Wonder Woman, voiced by John DiMaggio. In the film, he is an agent of Ares sent to kill Wonder Woman. Similar to his comic book counterpart, the film's version of Deimos possesses snake-like qualities, such as having snakes in place of his beard. Wonder Woman defeats and tries to interrogate him with the Lasso of Truth, only for one of his snakes to bite and kill him. * Eris appears in the Harley Quinn episode \\"Bachelorette\\", voiced by Jameela Jamil. This incarnation is depicted as the manager of a resort built on Themyscira, where Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and their friends have a bachelorette party for Ivy. Concurrently, Eris had placed the Amazons under mind control and secretly plotted to have Queen Hippolyta sign a contract to sell the island to LexCorp, but her scheme is thwarted by Harley and Ivy.

It is a highly conserved enzyme which is present in nearly all eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and Gram-negative eubacteria. Function PIMT acts to transfer methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the alpha side chain carboxyl groups of damaged L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl amino acids. The enzyme takes the end methyl residue from the methionine side chain and adds it to the side chain carboxyl group of L-isoaspartate or D-aspartate to create a methyl ester. Subsequent nonenzymatic reactions result in a rapid transformation to L-succinimide, which is a precursor to aspartate and isoaspartate. The L-succinimide can then undergo nonenzymatic hydrolysis, which generates some repaired L-aspartyl residues as well as some L-isoaspartyl residues, which can then enter the cycle again for eventual conversion to the normal peptide linkage. PIMT tends to act on proteins that have been non-enzymatically damaged due to age. By performing this repair mechanism, the enzyme helps to maintain overall protein integrity. This mechanism has been observed by several groups, and has been confirmed through experimental testing. In one report, PIMT was inhibited by adenosine dialdehyde. The results supported the proposed function of the enzyme, as the amount of abnormal L-aspartate residues increased when cells were treated with the indirect inhibitor, adenosine dialdehyde. Additionally, S-adenosylhomocysteine is known to be a competitive inhibitor of PIMT. When PIMT is not present in cells, the abnormal aspartyl residues accumulate, creating abnormal proteins that have been known to cause fatal progressive epilepsy in mice. It has been suggested that calmodulin may play a role in stimulating the function of PIMT, although the relationship between these two molecules has not been thoroughly explored. In addition to calmodulin, guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPgammaS) has been found to stimulate PIMT activity. Structure The enzyme is present in human cytosol in two forms due to alternative splicing and differs among individuals in the population due to a single polymorphism at protein 119, either valine or isoleucine. The enzyme structure is described as a ‚Äúdoubly wound alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure‚Äù which is quite consistent in all species analyzed thus far. If there is any difference in the sequences between different organisms it occurs in the regions connecting the three motifs in the sandwich structure, but the sequence of the individual motifs tends to be highly conserved. Researchers have found the active site to be in the loop between the beta structure and the second alpha helix and have determined it to be highly specific for isoaspartyl residues. For example, the residues found at the C-terminus of drosophila PIMT (dPIMT) are rotated 90 degrees so as to allow more space for a substrate to interact with the enzyme. In fact, dPIMT appears to alternate between this unique open conformation and the less open conformation common of PIMT in other organisms. Although possibly unrelated to this, increased levels of dPIMT in drosophila have been correlated with increase life expectancy in these organisms due to their importance in protein repair.

An all-rounder, he played county cricket for Worcestershire and Hampshire, as well as representing the Gentlemen against the Players, but he appeared most for Oxford University, whom he represented on 31 occasions. It was said in Wisden in 1914 that he was \\"one of the best all-round amateurs of his day,\\" and that if he had played more regularly, it was \\"quite likely\\" he would have played for England.Crickinfo.com : Wisden Obituaries in 1913 Early years Malvern College football team in 1900, with W H B Evans 2nd from left on back rowBorn in South Africa, the oldest of five children born into a family with a long history in the colonial service in India and South Africa, his grandfather William Evans was Deputy Surgeon General and Inspector General of hospitals in India in the mid-1800s. W H B Evans attended Malvern College where he joined the cricket team in 1896. He was in the Malvern College First Eleven from 1898 to 1901,Cricket Archive : Teams played for by William Evans being captain in his last year, Wisden states that \\"he must have been about the best public school cricketer in 1901, as he headed the Malvern batting with an average of 51, and took 53 wickets.\\" He was at Oriel College, Oxford, from 1901 to 1905 during which time he won his blue for cricket while still a freshman. A fine all-round sportsman, Evans also distinguished himself at football, playing for Malvern's First Eleven and Association Football, representing Oxford First Eleven for three seasons from 1902 where he played with another Old Malvernian, James Balfour-Melville.Roll of Honour ‚Äì World War I : James Elliott Balfour-Melville In company with B. S. Foster, he also won the Public School Racquets Championship in 1900. Cricket debut W H B Evans batting in 1905 He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Sussex in 1901 and took two wickets, his first victim being C. B. Fry. Evans' second-innings 53 also proved important, as the game ended in a draw with Worcestershire nine wickets down. In five further matches for the county he took only one more wicket, but he scored 107 against Gloucestershire at the end of August. Worcestershire's 342-run victory in that game remains (as of April 2007) their largest ever in terms of runs. In 1902 Evans played mostly for Oxford, hitting his career best of 142 against Sussex in June, but he also appeared several times for his new county of Hampshire. In all he made 609 first-class runs at 29.00 and took 18 wickets at 28.44. The following season his batting was less productive (he averaged only 19 and did not score a century) but he took 50 wickets, his highest season's aggregate, at 18.08, including hauls for Oxford of 7‚Äì41 (his career best) against Somerset and 7‚Äì43 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).Both 12-a-side, but nevertheless first- class, matches. He also made the first of his five appearances in Gentlemen v Players matches. 1904, when he captained Oxford, was Evans' best season with the bat, as in 19 innings he hit 861 runs at 47.83 including two hundreds and seven fifties. He took 34 wickets at a shade under 32 runs apiece, and returned nearly identical figures the following season, although this time his batting was slightly less productive. Later career On leaving Oxford in 1905 Evans joined the Egyptian Civil Service which resulted in fewer opportunities to play first-class cricket, and causing him to miss the next three seasons. Had he continued, Wisden considered it \\"quite likely that he would have had the distinction of playing for England.\\"Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1914. He made something of a return to the game in 1909, still with Hampshire, and claimed 32 first-class wickets at 18.59, including figures of 7‚Äì59 for his county against Gloucestershire (his batting was less good: 360 runs at 24). He played twice for the Gentlemen in July, but was then absent for more than a year, returning only at the end of the 1910 season for two final County Championship matches, in which he could manage only 55 runs and four wickets in total. This marked the end of Evans' first-class career. Death The wreckage of Evans' fatal air crash He died on Laffans Plain near Aldershot in Hampshire in a flying accident, aged only 30. On 7 August 1913 he was a passenger of Samuel Franklin Cody when he was test flying his latest design, the Cody Floatplane, when it broke up at 200 ft (60m) and he and Cody were both killed as they were thrown from the wreckage; neither Cody or Williams were strapped in, and experts at the time surmised that if they had been, both men might have survived. Cody's stepson Leon King had given up his place on the flight to Evans. His funeral was held on 13 August 1913 at St Peter's Church in Tadley in Hampshire. Large crowds attended, drawn there because of the tragic circumstances of his death. His body had been cremated, an unusual choice at that time, but perhaps due to the horrific injuries his body had received during the flying accident. The casket containing his ashes was buried in a grave beside that of his grandmother, Emma Evans, who had died in 1911. Leon King, Cody's stepson, was among the mourners, as were Evans's family and friends. The prayers of committal were read by the Rev L.P. Phelps, from Oriel College, Oxford, which Evans had left only eight years before. A number of his relatives played cricket to a high standard. His cousin John Evans played one Test for England; while his brothers Alfred and Dudley, another cousin Ralph and his uncle Alfred Henry Evans all played for Hampshire.

The Kispoko were the smallest of the five septs or divisions during the 18th century. They lived among the Creek as early as 1650, having been driven from their Ohio country homeland by the Iroquois Confederacy during the Beaver Wars. They returned about 1759. The other four divisions were the Chalahgawtha, Mekoche, Pekowi, and Hathawekela. (Each of the five division names have been spelled in a great variety of ways.) Together these divisions formed the loose confederacy that was the Shawnee tribe. The septs tended to serve different functions for the overall confederacy. Traditionally, the Shawnee had a patrilineal system, by which descent and inheritance went through paternal lines. The war chiefs were hereditary and descended from their paternal line in the Kispoko division. While historians have held that most of this sept relocated west of the Mississippi River in the 19th century, in the 20th and 21st centuries, two groups have organized and identified as Kispoko of the Shawnee; they are documented in Ohio and Indiana.

He appeared on T-shirts, dolls, puzzles and advertising all over New Zealand. He was voiced by After School camera operator and director Alan Henderson, who died on 15 February 2020. Appearance Thingee was usually presented as a grey (with brown undertones) humanoid thing with large bulbous eyes, a large toothless snout and a domed head. In a similar manner to the Rainbow characters Zippy and George, he was generally shown from the shoulders up, with one arm. Character history According to Stephen Campbell, one of the creators, both Thingee's name and species were accidental. The puppet was originally based on a duck, and the name used as a placeholder until they thought of a proper one. Thingee first appeared on After School in 1987. Viewers first saw what was believed to be perhaps the egg of a dragon, Thingee existed in egg form for several weeks on the show until he hatched. Thingee first teamed up with Jason Gunn in 1988 when Jason took over as host for After School. Jason and Thingee continued working together in 1989 on After 2. From 1992 on he co-hosted Jason Gunn vehicles Jase TV and The Son of a Gunn Show. They later starred in the straight to video film Jason and Thingee's Big Adventure. Thingee also appeared in celebrity editions of Wheel of Fortune, test cricket commentary and Face the Music in 1992. From 1996 he was a host on the Sunday morning television show What Now, where it was revealed that the character was an alien and eventually Thingee made contact with his people and made the decision to return home to his own planet.

He was particularly famous for developing microscopic foundations of the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory of superconductivity (Vitaly Ginzburg was awarded the 2003 Nobel prize in physics for developing, together with Lev Landau, that phenomenological theory). Gor'kov was a professor of physics at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, and a program director in Condensed Matter at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. He was one of the Magnet Lab's founding scientists.  Biography  Gor'kov was born in Moscow and received his academic training when he was at Moscow State University, after which he entered Kapitza Institute For Physical Problems, and eventually joined the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics. In 1966, he was awarded the Lenin Prize, Russia's highest award for scientific achievement, in recognition of his groundbreaking work on superconductivity. In 1981, he received the Bardeen Prize (with Alexei Abrikosov and Vitaly Ginzburg). In 1988, he received the Landau Prize, the highest award in Russia for theoretical physics. In 1992, less than a year after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he left Moscow for the United States at age 63. In 2004, he was a co-recipient of the prestigious Eugene Feenberg Award, given to recognize researchers who have advanced the field of many-body physics. In 2005, he became an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the very highest honors that can be bestowed on any U.S. scientist or engineer. He belonged to the last generation of scientists who were direct disciples of Soviet theorist Lev Landau. Gor‚Äôkov's contributions to physics reflect the unique style of the Landau Institute. In addition to his duties at the Magnet Lab, Gor'kov maintained his RAS membership and continued to perform research for the Landau Institute. In 2015, he was awarded the prestigious Ugo Fano Gold Medal of the Rome International Center for Materials Science Superstripes RICMASS for his key prediction of two electronics components in cuprate high temperature superconductors.

It was known as Chalcis () in antiquity, and there was an ancient Aetolian town at its foot named Chalcis, Hypochalcis or Chalceia (hence the name of the current administrative unit Chalkeia). It rises steeply from the coast of the Gulf of Patras to 917 m elevation. It is situated just east of the mouth of the river Evinos, 3 km east of Galatas, 14 km east of Missolonghi and 18 km northwest of Patras. 8 km to its east is the mountain Klokova. There are several rock climbing routes on the steep south and southwest faces of the Varasova. It is referred to as the Mount Athos of Rumelia or Western Greece, due to the large number of churches and monasteries (around 72) built in the Byzantine and the Ottoman period.Kryoneri tourist guide Several still exist today, including the 9th-18th century cave monastery of Agios Nikolaos near Kryoneri, which is only accessible by boat.Galatas tourist guide Local tradition tells us that the Titans endeavoured to throw this rock into the sea, so that it might form a bridge between the two coasts; but the rock proved too heavy, and was dropped where we see it today.

Her fine voice was basically a dramatic mezzo, with a warm middle register supporting strong top notes. Early life Rosina Raisbeck was born Ballarat, Victoria on 28 July 1916 but grew up in Maitland and Newcastle, New South Wales. In 1942 she began vocal studies at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music in Sydney, where she worked for five years. During that period she sang with the opera school in Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann and in 1944 she took part in the first performance of The Pearl Tree by Edgar Bainton, the English composer who was director of the conservatorium. The Pearl Tree, though written many years before, was given a glowing review by Neville Cardus in the Sydney Morning Herald. She ended her studies in 1946 by winning the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Concerto and Vocal Competition, and the Sun Aria Competition. Performance career After a concert tour of New Zealand, Raisbeck sailed for London with her husband James Laurie, whom she had married in 1943. A letter of recommendation from Eugene Goossens, newly appointed Director of the Conservatory, obtained her an audition at the recently formed Covent Garden Opera Company (now the Royal Opera) and she made her d√©but as Maddalena in Verdi's Rigoletto, later singing such roles as Flora in La traviata, Second Lady in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Mercedes in Bizet's Carmen, Wellgunde in Wagner's Das Rheingold and Rossweisse in Die Walk√ºre. Advised by the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham to become a soprano, Raisbeck studied with the tenor Dino Borgioli and from 1950 onwards she added Ortrud in Lohengrin, Senta in The Flying Dutchman, Third Norn in G√∂tterd√§mmerung (all by Wagner), and First Lady in The Magic Flute to her repertory. Raisbeck was a tall, imposing woman and managed to appear the very embodiment of evil in that role. She often sang alongside her fellow Australian Kenneth Neate. After leaving Covent Garden in 1953, she sang frequently in concert, and was one of the huge choir at Westminster Abbey that sang during the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Raisbeck planned to tour Australia the following year with Benjamin Fuller's Italian Opera, but, finding that she was pregnant, cancelled the tour. After her son was born, she did not sing again until 1958, when she gave guest performances of Ortrud and the title role of Beethoven's Fidelio with the Elizabethan Trust Opera Company in Sydney. Returning to London she sang with Sadler's Wells Opera in 1959, as Senta, and Elisabeth in Tannh√§user, as well as the Mother in the British premiere of Luigi Dallapiccola's The Prisoner, given by the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells. In 1961, she gave a dramatic performance of Kabanisha in Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's K√°≈•a Kabanov√°. Then, having divorced her husband, she returned to Australia with her son. For the next 10 years, Raisbeck sang wherever and whatever she could: a tremendously successful production of The Sound of Music, in which she sang the Abbess, with June Bronhill as Maria, was followed by Carousel. She gave concerts, and she sang in clubs and cabaret. Then in 1969 the Elizabethan Trust evolved into the Australian Opera; Raisbeck sang with the company from 1971 for the rest of her career. Her first role was Marcellina in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, followed by Akhrosimova in Prokofiev's War and Peace (1973; the first opera performed at the Sydney Opera House); she scored triumphs as Mrs Begbick in Kurt Weill's Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (1975) and as Herodias in Richard Strauss's Salome (1976). Raisbeck had sung in all three of the operas making up Puccini's Il trittico - as La Frugola in Il tabarro, as the Princess in Suor Angelica and as Zita in Gianni Schicchi - soon after joining the Australian Opera. In 1977, she sang the Princess again, opposite Joan Sutherland as Suor Angelica. The Duchess of Plaza Toro in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers and the Countess in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades were both successful; so was Kabanisha (1980). Raisbeck's career formally ended in 1985 with a much-admired performance of the First Prioress in Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites. She sang on for another three years, finally retiring in 1988, aged 72. Death She died on 23 December 2006, after a long illness, at age 90.

Yusaf Khan was promoted to Lieutenant General in June 1998 and sent as the Military Secretary (MS) in the GHQ. Later on 29 October 1998, he was transferred as Commander II Corps, Multan. Military coup of 1999 and Chief of General Staff During the time of military coup of 1999, the then Lieutenant General Muhammad Yusaf Khan was the Corps Commander Multan. Due to his close proximity to General Musharraf, by September 2000, he was posted as Chief of General Staff (CGS) to replace the then Lieutenant General Aziz Khan who was instead given the command of Lahore Corps. The post of Chief of General Staff is considered vital as the chief overlooks the two intelligence bureaus within Pakistan Army (Military Intelligence and Intelligence Bureau). In fact, it is believed that a military coup against a government cannot be launched without tacit approval of the Chief of General Staff. Vice Chief of Army Staff In October 2001, General Yusaf was promoted to four-star general and replaced Lieutenant General Muzaffar Usmani as the Vice Chief of Army Staff. He was junior only to Usmani, hence superseding one officer while ascending to the four-star post of VCOAS. The timing of promotion of General Yusaf and General Aziz Khan coincided with the US invasion of Afghanistan, when these generals superseded Lieutenant General Muzaffar Usmani and Lieutenant General Mahmud Ahmed, both of whom were known for their hawkish stances.'New Vice Chief and CJCSC' General Yusaf also stayed the ceremonial post of Colonel-in-Chief of the Armoured Corps of Pakistan Army.

HADHB is a subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein and has thiolase activity. Structure The HADHB gene is located on chromosome 2, with its specific location being 2p23. The gene contains 17 exons. HADHB encodes a 51.2 kDa protein that is composed of 474 amino acids; 124 peptides have been observed through mass spectrometry data.]  Function  Enzymatic activity of HADHB in beta-oxidation This gene encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, a catalyst of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. The HADHB protein catalyzes the final step of beta- oxidation, in which 3-ketoacyl CoA is cleaved by the thiol group of another molecule of Coenzyme A. The thiol is inserted between C-2 and C-3, which yields an acetyl CoA molecule and an acyl CoA molecule, which is two carbons shorter. The encoded protein can also bind RNA and decreases the stability of some mRNAs. The genes of the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein are located adjacent to each other in the human genome in a head-to-head orientation. Clinical significance Mutations in this gene, along with mutations in HADHA, result in trifunctional protein deficiency. Mutations in either gene have similar clinical presentations. Trifunctional protein deficiency is characterized by decreased activity of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, and long-chain thiolase. This deficiency can be classified into 3 main clinical phenotypes: neonatal onset of a severe, lethal condition resulting in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), infantile onset of a hepatic Reye-like syndrome, and late-adolescent onset of primarily a skeletal myopathy. Additionally, some presents showed symptoms associated with myopathy, recurrent and episodic rhabdomyolysis, and sensorimotor axonal neuropathy. In some cases, symptoms of the deficiency can present as dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and respiratory failure. The deficiency has presented as hydrops fetalis and HELLP syndrome in fetuses. A compound heterozygous mutation of the HADHB gene can causes axonal Charcot- Marie-tooth disease, which is a neurological disorder, which shows that mutations in this gene can result in deficiencies that present in new forms not currently described. Interactions HADHB is a functional molecular target of ERŒ± in the mitochondria, and the interaction may play an important role in the estrogen-mediated lipid metabolism in animals and humans. Additionally, HADHB has been shown to bind to the distal 3‚Äô untranslated region of renin mRNA, thereby regulating renin protein expression.

Munich-style stained glass was produced in the Royal Bavarian Stained Glass Manufactory, Munich, in the mid-19th century. King Ludwig I, opened the glassworks in 1827 which continued production of high quality glass until the early 20th century. Franz Xaver Zettler headed the operation for much of this time. Together with his major competitor, Franz Mayer of the Royal Art Institute, these stained- glass artists developed the so-called \\"Munich style\\" of expert painting on relatively large glass panels (as opposed to the medieval technique of smaller pieces of colored glass held in a leaded framework, later adapted and modified by the great American designer Louis Comfort Tiffany). Around 1862 the Franz Mayer of Munich Company started with stained glass paintings influenced by \\"Royal Bavarian Stained Glass Establishment\\". Their tendency was to create a picture-like composition similar to late Gothic paintings and Renaissance altars. The paintings were detailed. The style by Mayer and Zettler became known as \\"Munich Style\\" and went back to the traditional roots.

Biography  The son of a physician, and himself a graduate from the Military College in Constantinople as an ophthalmologist, Cevdet, initially a pious Muslim, was influenced by Western materialistic philosophies and was against institutionalized religion, but thought that \\"although the Muslim God was of no use in the modern era, Islamic society must preserve Islamic principles\\".≈û√ºkr√º Hanioƒülu, \\"Blueprints for a future society: late Ottoman materialists on science, religion, and art\\" in Elisabeth √ñzdalga, \\"Late Ottoman Society: The Intellectual Legacy\\", Routledge (2005), p. 41 He published the periodical ƒ∞√ßtihat from 1904‚Äì1932, in which articles he used to promote his modernist thoughts. He was arrested and expelled from his country several times due to his political activities and lived in Europe, in cities including Vienna, Geneva and Paris. His poetry was linked with the Symbolist movement in France, and he received accolades from leading French authors like Gustave Kahn.≈û√ºkr√º Hanioƒülu, \\"Blueprints for a future society: late Ottoman materialists on science, religion, and art\\" in Elisabeth √ñzdalga, \\"Late Ottoman Society: The Intellectual Legacy\\", Routledge (2005), p. 46 The overall goal of early Young Turks such as Cevdet was to bring to end the absolutist regime of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Cevdet and four other medical students (including Ibrahim Temo) at the Military Medical Academy in Istanbul founded the society of Ottoman Progress in 1889, which would become the \\"Committee of Union and Progress\\" (CUP).Jongerden (2012), p.69 Initially with no political agenda, it became politicized by several leaders and factions and mounted the Young Turk Revolution against Abdul Hamid II in 1908. However, Abdullah Cevdet and Ibrahim Temo cut their ties with the CUP soon after 1902, as the CUP began to advocate a Turkist nationalist policy.Jongerden, (2012), p.70 Instead he promoted his secular ideas in his magazine ƒ∞√ßtihat, where he published articles in support of several policies, which later were part of Atat√ºrk's Reforms like the shutting down of the madrases or the furthering of women's rights. In 1908 he joined the Ottoman Democratic Party (; ) which was founded against the CUP. In 1912 he and H√ºseyin Cahit advocated without success for the Latin script to be introduced in the Ottoman Empire.Landau (1984), p. 135 Cevdet was tried several times in the Ottoman Empire because some of his writings were considered as blasphemy against Islam and Muhammad. For this reason, he was labelled as the \\"eternal enemy of Islam\\" (S√ºssheim, EI) and called \\"Aduvullah\\" (the enemy of God).Karl S√ºssheim, ‚ÄúAbd Allah Djewdet‚Äô, Encyclopedia of Islam (EI1; Supplement), Leiden/Leipzig, 1938, 55‚Äì60. His most famous court case was due to his defense of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, which he considered an intermediary step between Islam and the final abandonment of religious belief, in his article in ƒ∞√ßtihat on 1 March 1922. For a brief period between 1921 and 1922 he was active for Kurdish independence. Religion and science Cevdat wanted to fuse religion and materialism, that is, under the influence of Victor Hugo and Jean-Marie Guyau, discard God but keep religion as a social force. In one poem he says: > We are pious infidels; our faith is that Being a disciple of God is > tantamount to love.

Following an appeal of Peyami Safa, a notable writer, the funeral prayer was performed. His body was then taken by city servants to the Merkezefendi Cemetery for burial.

He was a regular in the Leicestershire side for ten seasons and won his county cap in 1959. He was born in Guiseley in Leeds where his name was registered as Jack Geloven. Career A right-handed middle-order batsman and medium-paced bowler, van Geloven played 247 first-class matches, scoring 7,522 runs at a batting average of 19.43 runs per innings, taking 486 wickets at a bowling average of 28.62 runs per wicket and holding 137 catches. Throughout his time with Leicestershire the side was among the weakest in the County Championship and van Geloven's consistency made him more valuable than his figures might appear. He completed 1,000 runs in a season three times, with a best of 1,324 runs in 1959. But his best season overall was 1962, when he scored 1,055 runs and took exactly 100 wickets for his first, and only double. He completed the feat by taking the tenth wicket in the second innings of the last match of the season. He was the most recent Leicestershire player to achieve this feat. Later years After 1962, van Geloven's batting declined, and he left first- class cricket after the 1965 season. He then played for Northumberland in Minor Counties cricket until 1973, and, from 1977 to 1983, he served as a first-class umpire. Van Geloven died in August 2003, in Edinburgh, Scotland.

He was a prominent member of the Democratic Party.Scott, ed., 1991. p. 1 Henry's mother, Caroline, was the daughter of U.S. Congressman Edward St. Loe Livermore.Scott, ed., 1991. p. 1 Both of Henry's parents were descended from officers who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.Scott, ed., 1991. p. 2 Henry was a prodigy and in 1856 he enrolled in Harvard University at age 14 with his older brother Edward (\\"Ned\\").Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1 The brothers roomed together at a fashionable private boarding house near campus. The young Henry found the rigid atmosphere at Harvard \\"irksome\\" and was frequently admonished for \\"indecorum at prayers,\\" \\"neglect of mathematics,\\" and \\"tardiness at recitation.\\" Nonetheless, Henry graduated from Harvard in the middle of the class in 1860.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 2 He was reading law in his father's law office when the Civil War broke out. Initial reluctance to volunteer and enrollment in Union Army Henry's father obtained an appointment for Henry as a captain in the 2d Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment after the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter. Henry declined this appointment and, in May 1861, he joined the Fourth Battalion Massachusetts Volunteer Militia along with several of his friends, including his best friend, future United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. After Holmes and several other friends left to join the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Abbott joined that regiment on July 10, 1861. At the end of August 1861, Abbott was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, which became known as the \\"Harvard Regiment\\" because so many of its officers were Harvard graduates.Scott, 1991, p. 3 Abbott initially was more reluctant that his older brother, Ned, and his younger brother, Fletcher, to enlist.Scott, 1991, p. 3 He wrote to his father that he was more literary and domestic than his brothers but that he would be ashamed of himself forever if he did not do anything in the time of crisis.Scott, 1991, p. 3 Many of the soldiers in Abbott's company were sailors and fishermen from Nantucket.Scott, 1991, p. 4 The first commander of the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment was Colonel William Raymond Lee, a United States Military Academy graduate and professional soldier.Scott, 1991, p. 4 American Civil War service=Ball's Bluff, the Peninsula, Seven Days' Battles On October 21, 1861, Abbott's 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment was ordered to cross the Potomac River from their camp at Poolesville, Maryland and with other Union Army units to make a demonstration towards Leesburg, Virginia.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 4 This foray resulted in the comparatively minor Battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1; Scott, ed., pp. 4‚Äì5 The small battle had large consequences as the poorly scouted and coordinated movement of Union Army forces led to the rout of the Union force and the death of Colonel and U.S. Senator Edward Dickinson Baker, a close friend of President Abraham Lincoln. The U.S. Congress thereafter established the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which bedeviled generals and others for the rest of the war. The consequences were severe for the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment as well. The regiment suffered casualties of 30 per cent killed and wounded and 37 per cent captured. The Confederates routed the Union forces just after they had crossed the Potomac River from Maryland into Loudoun County, Virginia, scaled steep bluffs, crossed a field and run into the Confederate States Army forces hidden in the woods on the other side. Abbott ordered the men of his company to fight lying down but he continued to direct them from a standing and walking position.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 5 Despite Abbott's brave attempt to hold the line, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry and other Union troops were steadily forced back.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 5 The line finally broke and many men leaped over the bluffs and some tried to swim across the Potomac River and drowned.Scott, ed., 1991, pp. 5‚Äì6 Others drowned when the overloaded boats in which they tried to recross the river capsized.

Bartlett led survivors of the 20th Massachusetts Infantry up the river to Smart's Mill where they found a rowboat and got everyone across the river into Maryland under cover of darkness.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 6 The 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment held up well compared to most other Union regiments at Ball's Bluff but lost 87 of 300 men as killed and wounded and 111 as prisoners, including Colonel Lee, in its efforts to hold the Union line.Scott, ed., 1991, pp. 6‚Äì7 Abbott was promoted to first lieutenant on November 8, 1861.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 7 gives the date as November 25, 1861. After rebuilding its strength for four and one-half months at Poolesville, Maryland, the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment took part in the Peninsula Campaign.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 8 They were engaged especially at the Battle of Fair Oaks, Virginia where the regiment lost 28 men killed and wounded out of about 350.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 8 Later the 20th Massachusetts Infantry helped cover Major General George B. McClellan's retreat during the Seven Days' Battles.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, pp. 1‚Äì2; Scott, ed., pp. 8‚Äì9 On June 30, 1862, Abbott was wounded in the right arm at the Battle of Glendale, Virginia, which compelled him to leave the regiment temporarily in order to recuperate at home.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 10 He refused to leave the field, however, until after the Battle of Malvern Hill the next day.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 10 On August 9, 1862, Abbott's brother Ned was killed in action at the Battle of Cedar Mountain.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 11 Fredericksburg, Mud March, Second Fredericksburg On September 2, 1862, Abbott's regiment covered the retreat of the defeated forces of Union Major General John Pope after the Second Battle of Manassas or Bull Run. Weeks of hard duty took their toll on Abbott, who was not fully recovered from the wound he suffered at the Battle of Glendale. Abbott missed the Battle of Antietam because he was hospitalized with typhoid fever and grief over the death of his brother at Cedar Mountain.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2 The 20th Massachusetts Infantry again suffered heavy losses at Antietam. Soon after the battle, Abbott's brother Fletcher, who was suffering from dysentery, joined him in the hospital.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 12 Abbott recovered by November 1862 and returned to the regiment camped at Falmouth, Virginia across the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg, Virginia.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 13. He was accompanied on his return by Holmes, who was returning after recovery from a wound suffered at the battle of Antietam.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 13. Abbott next courageously led his men at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Due to the absence of Colonel Lee, Captain George Macy was acting colonel and Abbott was acting major of the regiment.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 14 In preliminary street fighting on the eve of the battle, Abbott was one of the few officers in the 20th Massachusetts Infantry not to be killed or wounded, when he and his men engaged in fierce combat the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment commanded by Abbott's Harvard classmate and friend, Lieutenant Lane Brandon.O'Reilly, Francis A., The Fredericksburg Campaign: Winter War on the Rappahannock, p. 98. Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, LA, 2003, paperback edition, 2006. . Brandon, who was informed that his men were fighting Abbott's company, had to be placed under arrest for disobeying orders to break off the fight when Union reinforcements started to come up. Abbott's men drove Confederate forces away from the river so Union Army engineers could complete pontoon bridges for a crossing in force.Scott, ed., 1991, pp. 14‚Äì15 Thirty of the 60 men that Abbott had led into combat had been killed or wounded.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 16 Overall, 113 of the 335 men in the regiment became casualties that day.Scott, ed., 1991, pp. 16‚Äì17 The next day, Abbott participated with his regiment in the disastrous Union Army assault on Marye's Heights where waves of Union attackers were cut down by Confederate artillery and infantry protected by a stone wall.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 17 Abbott survived unscathed, although a bullet did hit his scabbard.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 17 Sixty men and three officers were killed in a matter of minutes in the attack on Marye's Heights, bringing the losses of the 20th Massachusetts Infantry in the battle to 168 men and 8 officers of 335 men and officers engaged. Abbott in large part blamed Republican political leadership for the losses because they had removed Major General George McClellan, a fellow Democrat, from command of the Army of the Potomac. After the infamous \\"Mud March\\" of January 1863, Major General Joseph Hooker replaced Major General Ambrose Burnside as commanding general of the Army of the Potomac.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 18 In late March, Henry's 9-year old brother, Arthur, died from \\"the croup.\\" After two weeks in Boston following Arthur's death, Henry returned to his regiment. On May 3, 1863, Abbott fought with his regiment during the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, which was part of the Chancellorsville Campaign.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 19 Major General John Sedgwick, commander of the \\"grand division\\" of which the 20th Massachusetts Infantry was a part, was ordered to take Fredericksburg and then come to the aid of the bulk of the Union Army which came under heavy attack from Confederate forces at Chancellorsville.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 19 The 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment was on the far right of the line and suffered only 2 dead and 13 wounded, one of whom was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. who was wounded for the third time.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 19 In this battle, the Union troops overwhelmed the more lightly defended Marye's Heights.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 19 Sedgwick was stopped from joining Hooker at nearby Chancellorsville by Confederate forces at the Battle of Salem Church.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 20 Brigadier General John Gibbon's division, including the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, which had been left to hold the line at Fredericksburg, had to retreat across the Rappahannock River to join Hooker and Sedgwick, who had recrossed the river further upstream.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 20 Gettysburg, Pickett's Charge and Bristoe Station On June 5, 1863, Hooker realized that Confederate General Robert E. Lee was moving his army north and began to follow them, keeping the Army of the Potomac between Washington, D.C. and Lee's forces.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 20 President Lincoln accepted Hooker's resignation as commanding general of the Army of the Potomac on June 27, 1863Hooker gave as his reason the denial of his request to Major General Henry W. Halleck for reinforcements for the garrison at Harper's Ferry. and appointed Major General George Gordon Meade to replace him.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 20 The 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, under its new colonel, Paul J. Revere, grandson of the hero of the American Revolution of the same name, arrived in its position on Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on July 2, 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg.Scott, ed., 1991. p. 21 Although not moved to the front line until later that night, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry came under shelling on the evening of July 2, 1863. Eleven officers or men of the regiment were killed or severely wounded, including Colonel Revere, who was mortally wounded. The 20th Massachusetts Infantry was moved into the center of the line, about 100 yards to the left of a clump of trees that constituted the Union center and was main objective pointed out by General Lee. The Confederate bombardment of Union positions on Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg on the afternoon of July 3, 1863 was generally high and beyond the front line although the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment did suffer a few casualties during the shelling. The bombardment was followed by Pickett's Charge which the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry took a key part in repelling. Abbott was one of three unwounded officers in the regiment during Pickett's Charge and assumed command of the regiment when his superiors were wounded.Hess, Earl J., Pickett's Charge ‚Äì The Last Attack at Gettysburg, p. 278. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC, 2001. The 20th Massachusetts Infantry waited until the Confederates were close to the Union line and then unleashed murderous volleys which broke the Confederate Army's advance at that point.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 22 Realizing that they had repulsed the Confederate advance at great loss to the attackers, the Massachusetts soldiers began to shout \\"Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg\\" as they believed they had avenged their defeat and loss in that terrible battle.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 23 Then, Abbott had his men turn to help beat off the Confederate attack on the Union line at the clump of trees, which was at the very heart of the battle (the high water mark of the Confederacy).Scott, ed., 1991, p. 23 Although the battle had been won, over half of the enlisted men and 10 of the 13 officers of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry had been killed or wounded.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 23 After the battle, Abbott remained in command of the regiment and was promoted to major on October 10, 1863. Four days later, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry fought in the small but sharp action at Bristoe Station, Virginia. Union forces were surprised by the attack of Confederate Lieutenant General A. P. Hill's men.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 23 The 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry took few casualties, however, because they were able to fight from behind a steep railroad grade.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 23 After Major General Meade demonstrated against Confederate forces at the battle of Mine Run Creek, the Army of the Potomac went into winter quarters at Brandy Station, Virginia.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 24 In December 1863, Abbott received a 15-day leave to visit home, which was extended by 20 days due to his suffering from chronic diarrhea.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 24 In January 1864, Abbott left home to rejoin his regiment.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 25 Death at the Wilderness On May 4, 1864, newly appointed General-in-Chief of the Union Armies and Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant began his drive south into Virginia that became known as the Overland Campaign. Although two sources state that Abbott remained in command of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry until his death,Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2; Scott, ed., 1991, p. 23 another source says that Colonel George N. Macy returned to the regiment just before the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5‚Äì6, 1864, and that Abbott again assumed command of the regiment after Colonel Macy was wounded.Rhea, Gordon C., The Battle of the Wilderness, May 5‚Äì6, 1864, p. 364. Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, LA, 1994, Louisiana Paperback Edition, 2004. (pbk); John Gibbon's report in Official Records, Series I, Volume XXXVI, Part 1, p. 430; Alexander S. Webb's report in Official Records, Series I, Volume XXXVI, Part 1, p. 438 At the Battle of the Wilderness, on May 6, 1864, Major Henry Abbott was shot in the abdomen while encouraging his command from an exposed, standing position, after he ordered his men to fight while lying down, as he had done at the Battle of Ball's Bluff.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2; Rhea, 2004, p. 364 Mortally wounded, Henry Livermore Abbott died at a field hospital on the same day.Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2; Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 97 Brevet awards and posthumous praise Henry Livermore Abbott's service and exploits had gained him some notoriety so news of his death was met with consternation and grief at the highest levels of command and back in Lowell, Massachusetts. Holmes later said that Abbott was a friend whose death \\"seemed to end a portion of our life also.\\" On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Major Abbott for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, United States Volunteers, to rank from August 1, 1864.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 731 The United States Senate confirmed the award on February 20, 1865. On February 15, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Major Abbott for the award of the honorary grades of brevet lieutenant colonel, brevet colonel, and brevet brigadier general, United States Army (Regular Army), to rank from March 13, 1865.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 738 The U. S. Senate confirmed the awards on March 2, 1867. Abbott has been said to have been the most widely known and admired officer of his grade (or \\"rank\\") in the Army of the Potomac. Major General John Sedgwick said that Abbott was \\"a wonderfully good soldier\\" and \\"a bright, particular star.\\" Major General Winfield Scott Hancock said \\"his reputation was built upon a solid foundation, and the closest scrutiny could not diminish it.\\" Abbott's extensive correspondence with his family provides an especially good record of the engagements in which he fought and the generals and other personalities with whom he came into contact.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 27 Yet, over 90 percent of it remained unpublished until 1991.Scott, ed., 1991, p. 28 Henry Livermore Abbott's good friend, future United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who served in the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment with him, deeply admired Abbott for his courage and unruffled calm, and for his determination to do his duty even though he was deeply skeptical of Union war aims (except for preservation of the Union), was politically opposed to President Lincoln, and did not support the abolition of slavery because he thought it would die out in the near future. Holmes considered Abbott an ideal soldier, and praised him in a famous 1884 Memorial Day speech stating that: \\"In action he was sublime.\\"The paragraph from Holmes's speech in praise of Abbott is: \\"There is one who on this day is always present on my mind. He entered the army at nineteen, a second lieutenant. In the Wilderness, already at the head of his regiment, he fell, using the moment that was left him of life to give all of his little fortune to his soldiers. I saw him in camp, on the march, in action. I crossed debatable land with him when we were rejoining the Army together. I observed him in every kind of duty, and never in all the time I knew him did I see him fail to choose that alternative of conduct which was most disagreeable to himself. He was indeed a Puritan in all his virtues, without the Puritan austerity; for, when duty was at an end, he who had been the master and leader became the chosen companion in every pleasure that a man might honestly enjoy. His few surviving companions will never forget the awful spectacle of his advance alone with his company in the streets of Fredericksburg. In less than sixty seconds he would become the focus of a hidden and annihilating fire from a semicircle of houses. His first platoon had vanished under it in an instant, ten men falling dead by his side. He had quietly turned back to where the other half of his company was waiting, had given the order, \\"Second Platoon, forward!\\" and was again moving on, in obedience to superior command, to certain and useless death, when the order he was obeying was countermanded. The end was distant only a few seconds; but if you had seen him with his indifferent carriage, and sword swinging from his finger like a cane, you would never have suspected that he was doing more than conducting a company drill on the camp parade ground. He was little more than a boy, but the grizzled corps commanders knew and admired him; and for us, who not only admired, but loved, his death seemed to end a portion of our life also.\\" Holmes said a little later in the speech: \\"I have spoken of some of the men who were near to me among others very near and dear, not because their lives have become historic, but because their lives are the type of what every soldier has known and seen in his own company. In the great democracy of self- devotion private and general stand side by side. Unmarshalled save by their own deeds, the army of the dead sweep before us, \\"wearing their wounds like stars.\\" It is not because the men I have mentioned were my friends that I have spoken of them, but, I repeat, because they are types. I speak of those whom I have seen. But you all have known such; you, too, remember!\\" Source: http://people.virginia.edu/~mmd5f/memorial.htm, retrieved September 25, 2010.

The book's origins lay in a screenplay that Segal wrote, and that was subsequently approved for production by Paramount Pictures. Paramount requested that Segal adapt the story into novel form as a preview of sorts for the film. The novel was released on February 14, 1970, Valentine's Day. Portions of the story originally appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal.Erich Segal. Love Story. (Harper & Row) 1970. Love Story became the top-selling work of fiction for all of 1970 in the United States, and was translated into more than 20 languages. The novel stayed for 41 weeks in The New York Times Best Seller list, reaching the top spot. A sequel, Oliver's Story, was published in 1977. A film adaptation was released on December 16, 1970.  Summary  Love Story is romantic and funny, yet tragic. It is the tale of two college students whose love enables them to overcome the adversities they encounter in life: Oliver Barrett IV, a Harvard jock and heir to the Barrett fortune and legacy, and Jennifer Cavilleri, the quick-witted daughter of a Rhode Island baker. Oliver (Ollie) was expected to assume control of his father's business empire, while Jennifer (Jenny) was a music major studying at Radcliffe College and planning to study in Paris. From very different worlds, Oliver and Jenny are immediately attracted to each other and their love deepens. The story of Jenny and Ollie is a story of two young people who come from two separate worlds and are brought together in the unlikeliest of ways. Upon graduation from college, the two decide to marry, against the wishes of Oliver's father, who promptly severs all ties with his son. Without financial support, the couple struggles to pay Oliver's way through Harvard's Law School, with Jenny working as a private school teacher. Graduating third in his class, Oliver gets several job offers and takes up a position at a respectable New York law firm. The couple move to New York City, excited to spend more time together, rather than working and studying. The pair decide to have a child. After Jenny fails to conceive, they consult a medical specialist, who after repeated tests, informs Oliver that Jenny is suffering from leukemia, making it clear that \\"she's dying\\". As instructed by his doctor, Oliver attempts to live a normal life without telling Jenny of her condition. Jenny nevertheless discovers her ailment after confronting her doctor about it. With their days together numbered, Oliver is desperate and seeks financial relief from his father. Instead of telling his father what the money is truly for, Oliver misleads him. From her hospital bed, Jenny speaks with her father about funeral arrangements, and then asks for Oliver. She tells him to avoid blaming himself, and asks him to hold her tightly before she dies. When Mr. Barrett realizes that Jenny is ill and that his son borrowed the money for her, he immediately sets out for New York. By the time he reaches the hospital, Jenny has died. Mr. Barrett apologizes to his son, who replies with something Jenny had once told him: \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry...\\" and breaks down in his arms.  Sources  New York in 1971 stated that Jenny resembled the \\"myopic, athletic, brisk princess\\" Brenda Patimkin in Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus. It is sometimes said that Al Gore falsely claimed that the plot is based on his life at Harvard. In fact, Al Gore mentioned, correctly, that he had read that the characters were based on him and his wife. In 1997, Segal confirmed Gore's account, explaining that he had been inaccurately quoted in the Nashville Tennessean and that \\"only the emotional family baggage of the romantic hero... was inspired by a young Al Gore. But it was Gore's Harvard roommate, Tommy Lee Jones, who inspired the half of the character that was a sensitive stud, a macho athlete with the heart of a poet\\". Erich Segal had met both Jones and Gore at Harvard in 1968, when he was there on sabbatical. Reception The novel was an instant commercial success despite scathing reviews. It was nominated for a National Book Award, but withdrawn when the judges threatened to resign. William Styron, the head judge for fiction that year, called it \\"a banal book which simply doesn't qualify as literature\\" and suggested that even by being nominated it would have \\"demeaned\\" all the other novels under consideration.

The federal government funds the Canada Student Loan Program (CSLP) and the provinces may fund their own programs or be integrated with the CSLP. In addition, Canadian banks offer commercial loans targeted for students in professional programs. Government loans Canadian citizens, permanent residents of Canada living in any province for over a year, and protected persons are normally eligible for loans provided by the federal government, through the CSLP, in addition to loans provided by their province of residence. Loans issued to full-time students are interest free while a student is in full-time studies. Students receiving a Canada Student Loan (CSL) for the first time on or after August 1, 1995, are eligible for up to 340 weeks (~6.5 years) of interest-free status on their loan balance. Students in doctoral programs are eligible for an additional 60 weeks, up to 400 weeks (~7.5 years). Students with permanent disabilities and students who received their first CSL prior to August 1, 1995 are eligible for up to 520 weeks of assistance (10 years), though certain provincial loans may have different limits. Whether in receipt of student loans or not, students in full-time study are not required to repay their student loans. Depending on the issuing jurisdiction, interest begins to accumulate immediately upon leaving studies. Assistance is available for students in part-time studies, with rules slightly different based on the program. Beginning January 1, 2012, the Government of Canada eliminated interest on part-time student loans while borrowers are in-study. Student loan borrowers begin repaying their student loans six months after they graduate or leave school, although interest may begin after the Period of Study End Date. Grants may supplement loans to aid students who face particular barriers to accessing post-secondary education, such as students with permanent disabilities or students from low-income families. Canada Student Loans of up to $210 per week of full-time study or 60% of the student's assessed need (the lesser of these) can be issued per loan year (August 1‚ÄìJuly 31). Loans issued through provincial programs will normally provide students with enough funding to cover the balance of their assessed need. Part-time loans cannot exceed $10,000 in principal at any given time History Prior to 1964, the national student loan program s known as the Dominion-Provincial Student Loan Program. This program was a matching grant partnership system between the federal and provincial governments. It was started in 1939 and ended with the start to the CSLP in 1964. Some text from the Department of Human Resources and Social Development Canada: > The CSLP was created in 1964. Since its inception, the Program has > supplemented the financial resources available to eligible students from > other sources to assist in their pursuit of post-secondary education. > Between 1964 and 1995, loans were provided by financial institutions to > post-secondary students who were approved to receive financial assistance. > The financial institutions also administered the loan repayment process.

Due to the close nature of the CSLP and the provincial student loan programs, the changes in 1995 and 2000 were largely mirrored by the provincial programs. As a result of these changes, students who attended school before and after these transition years may find that they have up to 6 different loans to manage (pre-1995 federal & provincial; 1995-2000 federal & provincial; and post-2000 federal & provincial). The extent to which this is possible depends largely on a student's province of residence.

Students may also be eligible for government loans that are interest free while in school on top of this line of credit, as private loans do not count against government loans/grants. The March 2011 federal budget announced a Canada Student Loan forgiveness programme for medical and nursing students to complement other health human resources strategies to expand the provision of primary health services. The programme is meant to encourage and support new family physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses to practise in underserved rural or remote communities of the country, including communities that provide health services to First Nations and Inuit populations.Government of Canada. 2011.

National Student Loan Service Center The National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC) is an agency created by the Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP) where Canadian Federal loan holders manage their student loan. The NSLSC manages CSLP (Federal) loans as well as provincially-integrated loans for the following provinces: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The NSLSC website (nslsc.ca) can be used to maintain student loan holders files, confirm enrolment, check disbursement status, apply for the Repayment Assistance Plan, as well as make payments on their loans. Loan administration and repayment The Canada Student Loan Program (sometimes referred to as the National Student Loan) is administered by National Student Loan Service Centre under contract to Human Resources and Social (Skills) Development Canada (HRSDC). Students have the choice of opting for a fixed interest rate of prime interest rate, or a floating interest rate. Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island were the only provinces where there was no interest on the provincial loan, but as of March 28, 2014, the government of Nova Scotia also eliminated interest for all graduates who entered repayment after Nov. 1, 2007. The government of British Columbia eliminated interest on its student loans on February 19, 2019. In September 2010 the amount of student loans owed to the Government of Canada surpassed $15 billion. Repayment assistance CSLP offers a number of programs to assist students who find themselves facing financial difficulty during repayment. These are provided to government-sponsored student loanholders. Among these programs are: ;Repayment Assistance{{cite weburl=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student- aid/grants-loans/repay/assistance/rap.html :Repayment Assistance is designed to help students meet repayment obligations if they are temporarily unable to make payments on their government student loans because of unemployment or low income. Repayment Assistance is granted for periods of six months. Some rules, such as Canadian residency, may apply. Once approved for Repayment Assistance, borrowers will be assessed for an affordable payment amount which may be zero or more. The Federal and/or provincial government will then assist in paying interest and/or principal so long as the borrower continues to be approved for the program. Borrowers can apply online on the NSLSC website. ;Revision of Terms :Revision of Terms is a feature that provides students with the flexibility to manage loan repayment in a way that is responsive to individual situations. It can be used to decrease monthly payments by increasing the repayment period (from the standard 11.5 years up to 15 years) should a student find the standard terms difficult to maintain. It can also be used to increase loan payments by reducing the repayment period, allowing more rapid repayment of a loan. ;Severe Permanent Disability Benefit :Along with Repayment Assistance for borrowers with permanent disabilities, the Severe Permanent Disability Benefit is an additional program for borrowers with disabilities. It allows for the elimination of debt for students who are experiencing exceptional financial hardship due to a severe permanent disability.

The story is set on the Atlantic coast of France in the Napoleonic wars during the British Invasion of France in 1814. Plot Major Richard Sharpe joins a combined naval and infantry expedition to the French coast with the intention of capturing a fortress and several chasse-mar√©es, and inciting a monarchist rebellion in Bordeaux. The mission is intended primarily as a diversionary action to draw French forces from defense against a British crossing of the Adour River, but Sharpe is unaware of this. The chassee-mar√©es are needed to construct a floating, temporary bridge of the Adour, and British intelligence holds out little expectation of an actual monarchist uprising. Sharpe is accompanied by naval Captain Horace Bampfylde and, at the last moment, is joined by the Comte de Maquerre, ostensibly a member of the Chasseurs Britannique but in fact a spy for French intelligence. Bampfylde bungles the combined operation and wanders perilously close to an ambush set by American sailors under the command of Cornelius Killick. Sharpe intervenes decisively to capture the fortress and the American troops. Bampfylde later plans to hang all of the Americans as pirates but Sharpe again intervenes and, after swearing Killick to an oath of future non-aggression, sets the Americans at liberty. Sharpe then marches inland, toward Bordeaux, while Bampfylde consolidates the landing position and writes official reports wherein he claims all of the successes as his own. Sharpe prosecutes a successful raid on a supply and reinforcement column and then retreats back toward the fortress. He is met by de Maquerre who claims Bordeaux has risen in open rebellion; de Maquerre then travels to the fortress and informs Bampfylde that Sharpe's contingent has been destroyed to the man, and that a vast French force is moving rapidly toward the fortress. The cowardly Bampfylde strips the fortress of supplies, spikes the guns, and detonates the main arsenal‚Äîseriously damaging the fortress' defensive capabilities. He then sails home, leaving Sharpe abandoned and without supplies. Hours later, an astounded Sharpe falls back to the ruined fortress and improves his position. Meanwhile, French intelligence agent Major Pierre Ducos joins with General Calvet and a large French force to lay siege to the fortress. Sharpe's men fight against impossible odds but manage to hold off several assault waves. Ducos orders Killick to break his oath and participate in the siege against Sharpe. Sharpe then travels secretly by night and meets with Killick to arrange for a contrived surrender. In exchange for being released from the non-aggression oath, Killick agrees with Sharpe's proposal. The next morning Killick's ship makes a minor preparatory bombardment of the coastal fortress, prior to the French assault, whereupon Sharpe surrenders to the American privateer. While confusion runs through the French forces, Sharpe's men rapidly board the American privateer. The last boats leave the beach as an enraged Ducos orders a technically illegal assault on the ostensibly American-held fortress. Killick lands Sharpe close to British lines, and Sharpe leads his men to safety. He then makes a final report, in the process insulting Bampfylde and killing the traitorous de Maquerre upon the newly completed floating bridge.

Television adaptation The novel was adapted for the fourth season of the Sharpe television series, guest starring Christian Brendel as Maquerre, Christopher Villiers as Bampfylde and James Ryland as Captain Palmer. The adaptation gave Maquerre a sister, Catherine (played by Amira Casar), who remains behind at the fort when it is captured by the British and serves as a secondary love interest for Sharpe. The nautical element is removed, making Bampfylde the new commanding officer of the Prince of Wales' Own Volunteers and omitting Killick altogether. Hogan was replaced with Major-General Ross, a character created for the series, and both he and Sharpe's wife Jane suffer from fever but recover. Ducos poses as the Mayor of Bordeaux, who is a separate character in the novel, and Maquerre's death is altered, with him remaining with the French and being shot from a distance by Hagman. The adaptation ends with Bampfylde being arrested for deserting his post.

Located in the Strip District in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, it is a prime example of the so-called 'Polish Cathedral' style of churches. It is known also as 21st and Smallman Street Church. It is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. History of Saint Stanislaus Kostka The congregation was formed in 1873 when 200 Polish families banded together to form the St. Stanislaus Kostka Beneficial Society. The first pastor was Antoni Klawiter, who arrived in October 1875 and left in 1877. The availability of unskilled mill jobs in Pittsburgh in the late 19th century attracted a flood of immigrants from Eastern Europe. By 1915, more than 80% of Strip District residents were foreign-born, and 30% were Polish. St. Stanislaus Kostka Church was constructed in 1891, designed by Pittsburgh architect Frederick C. Sauer (1860‚Äì1942). In March 1936 there was a disastrous flood on Saint Patrick's Day. Water flooded the church as high as the top of the wainscoting on the walls. The pews were afloat and the Pastor was trapped in the rectory on the second floor. In December 1936, an explosion at the Pittsburgh Banana Company weakened the towers and the original baroque style bonnets were removed. Examples of the bonnet style are still found on the top of the sidewall pilasters and the ventilation cupola on the center of the roof. Three of the medallion windows over the altars were also covered over. On September 20, 1969, Cardinal Karol Wojty≈Ça, the future Pope John Paul II, visited and offered prayers at St. Stanislaus Kostka. After cordial greetings, the Cardinal is quoted as commenting on how beautiful the church was and how it reminded him of the churches in Poland. He knelt in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament and then to the Side Altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary, now the location of a humble memorial to the Pope. Architecture of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Saint Stanislaus Kostka's architectural style is a blend of Romanesque and Baroque, with Byzantine influences. Construction of the present Saint Stanislaus Kostka church was started in April 1891, and the church was consecrated on July 31, 1892. The church is a one-story brick edifice covering an area of . The church is built on the ground surface, and there is no basement. The walls are from thick. The church measures wide and deep and stands high.http://www.polisharchives.com/media/parish_pdf/PIT/pit-29.1.pdf In 1936, the church endured flood and explosion damage. The twin towers support a total of seven bells. The right tower holds the St. Michel bell , the St. Barbara bell and the St. Anthony bell . The left tower holds the St. Casimer bell , the St. Joseph bell , the St. Rosa bell and the St. Stanislaus bell . Five of these bells were electrified in 1956. The stained glass figure windows were produced in Munich, Germany, at the Royal Bavarian Art Institute at a cost of $27,672‚Äîa major expenditure for that time. Compared with today's dollar value it would cost almost $538,000. According to experts, the windows in the Saint Stanislaus Kostka Church are some of the best period \\"Munich Style\\" stained glass in the United States. There are three Latin inscriptions in the church interior. On the front of old main altar: Se Nascens Deditsocium \\"By his birth He offers himself as a companion\\" On the altar canopy: Se Moriens In Praetium \\"Dying, he offers himself as victim.\\" On the window over the altar canopy: Se Regnans Dat In Praemium \\"Reigning, He offers himself as a reward.\\" On the Christ the King center window above the crown, in Christ's hand is a banner which reads: Qui Vicerit Dabei Sedere, Mecum In Throno Meo \\"He who has conquered (God) will grant you to sit with me on my throne\\" The original interior also did not have the murals we see today as the murals have changed over the years. The current paintings in the semi-dome over the altar were done by the Italian artist, Vincent Scatena and were completed for the Golden Jubilee of the parish in 1925.

It describes the moment a person receives the news of someone's death. There are many roles that contribute to the death notification process. The notifier is the person who delivers the death notice. Notifiers can be volunteers, medical personnel or law enforcement. The receiver is the designated person receiving the information about the deceased. Typically, the receiver is a family member or friend of the one who has died. Death education is provided for multiple types of jobs to deliver the news efficiently for each situation. A proper death notification allows the receiver to begin the grieving process. The history of death notification dates back to the existence of humankind, but there have always been different means of death notification. Before modern technology, death notification was done through telegram, as there were not the same means of transportation, which today allow for the more formal notification that is required. During the 1800s and early 1900s, death notification was not as complex a process as it is today. There were not the means to deliver a written notification, so notices were left at funeral homes. Today, there are more requirements to follow. One of these requirements being that the name of the deceased is not released to any outside sources until after 24 hours of the survivors being notified. One key reason being that the survivors are the first to find out in the formal manner.  Death notifiers  World War II poster, \\"Next of kin has been notified.\\" The protocol for each notifier differs because each situation is unique. Police officers become very involved with most families that deal with death outside of medical facilities. The news is usually delivered in person, as soon as possible, with another officer, in clear and plain language, and with compassion. One of the main reasons there are two people at the home is so that if an individual has a negative reaction there is additional support for them and support for the notifier in case of a person lashing out. The officers enter the receiver's residence to make the situation more personal. A chaplain, a clergy member who works in hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, armed forces, police, or emergency medical services may alternatively deliver the news. The main goal is to deliver the news of a death, but also to help mend a broken family emotionally and spiritually. He also must try to explain and make sense of the tragedy. Medics do not have time to establish a bond with the family and usually deliver the news in an authoritative manner, then try to reassure and relieve them. The Military of the United States withholds the name of a deceased member until 24 hours after the family has been notified. For military notifications, there are usually multiple persons involved: the notifying officer, a chaplain who accompanies the notifying officer throughout the process and who may also assist in delivering the news, a medic (in case the family member faints), and an officer who stays in the car in case the family members react violently. The US Army Manual states that > \\"The Next of Kin will be notified promptly in an appropriate dignified and > understanding manner by a uniformed service representative. He/she will wear > the Class \\"A\\" uniform and present a soldierly appearance when making > notification.\\" It is the U.S.Army policy to make personal notification to the primary next of kin and secondary next of kin of the deceased soldier within four hours after learning of the death. Notification would take place from 0600 to 2200. The process for death notification in the military is a three phase process. The people doing the notifying are also in the military, and are usually in a four-member team. Phase 1- This phase deals with both logistical and personal preparation such as designating who will do the talking. Phase 2- This phase involves driving to the home, knocking on the door, and stating \\"I have been asked to inform you that your [son/daughter] has been reported dead in [city, state, country] at [time and date]. [Briefly state the circumstances.] On the behalf of the Secretary of Defense, I extend to you and your family my deepest sympathy in your great loss\\". Phase 3- This phase is when the team leaves the home. The team leader must feel that the situation is under control before they leave the premises. Denny Hayes, who spent fifteen years as a chaplain for the FBI‚Äôs critical response team, says: > * Always deliver bad news in person. * Always bring a partner (\\"95 percent > of them defer to me to do the actual speaking of the words‚Äînobody wants to > experience sad\\"). * Skip the euphemisms‚Äîthey comfort no one except the > person speaking them. * Never abandon anyone until they have someone else to > hold onto. \\"You can‚Äôt make it better,\\" said Dr. Nancy Davis, former chief of counseling services for the FBI. \\"But you can definitely make it worse.\\"  Death receivers  Death receivers include parents, children, friends, lovers, co- workers, and other incident survivors. Each receiver responds to the news in a different way because each relationship was unique to the deceased. Most parents want to hold their child's body and collect a physical memento. They often create a memory box filled with the child handprint, lock of hair, and/or clothing. Centers believe that parents should be encouraged to see their dead child multiple times to provide relief. Children have unpredictable reactions to death, depending on their age, previous experience with death, and the emotional support around them. When telling a child about a death, one should use real words to describe the death and let them know that the death is permanent. Children can understand death at a very young age so they should be told the truth about the situation. The notifier should answer questions the child has and allow the child to express their feelings. When notifying friends, encouragement to seek closure about unresolved issues with the deceased is most efficient.  Death education in professions  Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) received a grant from the Department of Justice in 1988 to train police officers in death notification. If done properly, the receiver will be able to go on through the mourning process. MADD began their death notification education program in order to create comforting and professional death notifications. Police officers have to report more deaths compared to any other occupation, which is why the education provided by MADD is crucial. Licensed social workers collaborated with health care professionals to create a protocol for notifying the family of the deceased. This includes having the family view the body and talk with the medical staff in order to answer questions about the situation and discuss the next steps to take.  Notifications in various settings  Physicians and other health care professionals are faced with losing patients more times than they would want to think about. Due to this, they too are responsible for coming to the family with the distressing news. Along with law enforcement notification, physicians \\"do not receive specific instructions on death notification skills\\" (Henderson, 2012). Since there is a lack of training, this makes breaking the bad news extremely stressful, which then leaves the physicians more susceptible to burnout and becoming dissatisfied with their job performance and duties (Henderson, 2012). Explaining what happened and being clear with the family is very important when giving a death notification; not using words that are difficult to understand is crucial (Vandekieft, 2001). Death notification can be completed in an office (work) setting and or a hospital. In both of these settings the notification is given in a room that the survivor can have their own privacy in. For example, when giving the death notification in a work setting, ask permission from their supervisor and take them to a private room to deliver the notification. When giving death notification in a hospital setting there are already set protocols, since it is a large institution, but it would still be in a private room. When giving death notification in a hospital it is key that this notification is not done in a common area such as a waiting room or hallway. Once the notification is complete there are various forms that survivors must complete and the notifiers help in completing these. Aside from the forms, the notifiers also can take the survivors to the body if the survivors choose to do so. The \\"last\\" part of the job that the individual notifying survivors completes is to follow up and stay in contact while the family needs support and help in answering any questions about the death.  Universal tips for death notification  Since death notification is such a difficult job there are universal guidelines, which can be used across professions. Giving unfortunate news in person is extremely important (Campbell, 1992), so making sure the families do not find out through social media, a phone call, or any other types of communication is necessary. A person notifying will ensure the family that someone cares and is supported. Thinking before they speak, (Moldovan, 2009) and not giving the family harmful information that may cause more pain. Making sure the notification happens in a timely manner (Flaherty, 2005) although this may focus more on military and law enforcement, it is important for the families. Finally, for the person doing the notification (Vandekieft, 2001) they should allow themselves to be sympathetic of the family's loss, without being overly emotional or appearing to be uncaring. It is clear that no matter the profession, a death notification needs to be done sensitively, clearly, and efficiently.  See also  * Casualty notification  Bibliography   *Bennett, D., & Campbell, B.

Biography Cozzens was born in New York City on 5 March 1818. In early life, he became a wine merchant. Beginning in 1854, he was the proprietor and editor of Cozzens' Wine Press, a magazine on the culture of wine. In its issues, which he ran until 1861, he particularly promoted American wines.Pinney, Thomas. A History of Wine in America: From the Beginnings to Prohibition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989: 221. Cozzens had previously contributed humorous poems and articles to magazines, and in 1853 he issued his first volume, Prismatics, under the pen name \\"Richard Haywarde\\". Then came The Sparrowgrass Papers, first published in The Knickerbocker, and collected in book form in 1856. The book, which was immediately popular and also published under the name Haywarde, followed a family that moved from New York City to the countryside in Yonkers.Burt, Daniel S. The Chronology of American Literature: America's Literary Achievements from the Colonial Era to Modern Times. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004: 205. Three years later (1859) he published a volume of travel sketches, Acadia; or a Sojourn among the Blue Noses. The book reported on the difficulties of blacks who settled in Nova Scotia along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.Snodgrass, Mary Ellen. The Underground Railroad: An Encyclopedia of People, Places, and Operations. New York: Routledge, 2015: 100. Soon after the American Civil War he failed in a business for which he had labored earnestly, especially by promoting the sale of native wines, and retired from Yonkers to Rahway, New Jersey. His other works include Poems (1867) and a Memorial of Fitz-Greene Halleck (1868). He was married with Susan (Meyers) Cozzens and was the father of the marine artist Fred S. Cozzens (1846-1928).

Fellowship training programme The fellowship training programme requires that prospective trainees are registered medical practitioners in Australia and/or New Zealand. Specifically, prospective trainees must have completed a medical degree; completed an intern year; been appointed to an accredited hospital by the College for basic training; discussed their application with, and received approval from, the accredited hospital or a Director of Physician Education. International medical graduates must complete the Australian Medical Council Certificate in addition to the aforementioned requirements. Multiple pathways lead to fellowship, but all pathways require significant amount of training, time and commitment and consist of three main stages: *Basic training; *RACP examinations; and, *Advanced training. The qualification of FRACP is awarded for training programmes in adult internal medicine and in paediatrics and child health. Both programmes have a similar structure, but the content and examinations are accordingly different. Basic training Basic training, formally the Royal Australasian College of Physicians's Physician Readiness for Expert Practice (PREP), consists of a series of 36 months of accredited hospital posts, approved by local directors of physician training. These posts encompass a variety of medical specialties; emergency medicine; and tertiary centre, regional, and rural hospital rotations. The programme must contain prescribed proportions of the aforementioned areas and locations and is assessed by ongoing continuous assessment by the candidate's supervising physicians. Basic training is approximately equivalent to the internal medicine residency program in the United States or core medical training programme in the United Kingdom. RACP examinations After 24 months of basic training, trainees become eligible to sit the external RACP examinations. These consist of a written and a clinical examination. The written examination consists of multiple-choice questions and is held once a year in February. The clinical examination, consisting of two long cases and four short cases, is examined by two assessors (per case) and is held in July, after successful completion of the written exam. Both examinations must be successfully completed before a trainee may progress to advanced training. The written examination is analogous to the board certification examination for internal medicine in the United States and the MRCP Part 1 and 2 (written) exams in the United Kingdom. Unlike the United States and United Kingdom examinations, however, the RACP examinations do not confer an award or qualification upon their successful completion; instead, the entire RACP programme must be successfully completed for the award and qualification of FRACP. The RACP examinations are the primary hurdle to becoming a specialist physician and are noted for being among the most difficult specialty exams in the world, with an average first- attempt fail rate of approximately 50%. Advanced training Advanced training consists of a programme of 3‚Äì4 years, depending on the requirements of the specialty, of training in a specialty of the trainee's choosing. A trainee must meet the requirements of the specialty advisory group via undertaking, for instance, clinical training in hospital posts, research, or clinical training in overseas hospital posts or research overseas. Multiple specialisations and subspecialisations are possible, but this is associated with increases in training time. Unlike the United States, Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom, most specialties do not require an exit examination. Recognition Fellowship appears to be a highly regarded qualification, given the extended and rigorous training program,the wide experience & knowledge base, and general commitment required for its attainment. Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (or its recognised equivalent) is a requirement to be recognised as a Specialist or Consultant Physician, in General (Internal) Medicine or the relevant subspecialty, in Australia and New Zealand. A formal complex process (for recognition of equivalence) is needed for specialists who possess overseas specialist qualifications but who do not possess the FRACP. The requirements change from time to time. External commentators, such as Mr Peter Garling, SC, have described these processes as 'onerous' during a 2008 statutory inquiry. FRACP or its recognised equivalent, in Australia, also allows some Physicians to be recognised as specialists within the Health Insurance Act 1973, and therefore charges incurred by patients when consulting them, may be reimbursed in whole or part by the Australian Government. In Australia, like in the UK and some other jurisdictions, the FRACP (and other fellowships) does not give the right to statutory registration as a medical practitioner: it is the basic medical degree which does. The RACP claims that accountability for the quality of the examination processes within the RACP is of the highest standard. The clinical examination process requires rigorous calibration of all examiners (mandatory) and assessment of all candidates against the clinical skills required of Consultation Physicians in Australia - history taking, clinical analytical abilities and clinical Skills. Evaluation of the clinical examiners includes assessment by other (often more experienced) examiners and high level peer review (by at least 1 other examiner at a local level, and by 6-9 at the national level, always in combination). The National Examinations Panel (NEP) consist of 97 adult physicians selected by their prior examination performance and who represent the geographical spread and specialist range of clinical internal medicine skills in Australia and New Zealand.

At the trial the murder was determined to be justifiable homicide. Early life Thomas Hubbard was born in Kinderhook, New York, in 1806.Corning, Howard M. (1956). Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 119. By 1834 he had left New York and joined Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth's expedition to Oregon Country where Wyeth attempted to set up a fur trading network. Oregon Country In September 1834, the Wyeth party reached Fort Vancouver, the Hudson's Bay Company premier station in the Columbia Department. On Wapato Island, the Americans constructed Fort William, where Hubbard served as the gunsmith. The next year Hubbard was accused of murdering the fort's tailor, Thornburgh. Thornburgh had entered Hubbard's residence in the night with a rifle with the intention of murder, although Hubbard had been made aware of this.Hines, Gustavus. A Voyage Round the World. Buffalo, NY: George H. Derby and Co. 1850, pp. 248-249 Hubbard had two loaded pistols ready and shot Thornburgh in the chest, killing him. In the subsequent trial overseen by Wyeth's friend, naturalist John Kirk Townsend, Hubbard was found not guilty as the death was ruled justifiable homicide. The fight that lead to the death had been over a Native American woman named Mary St. Martin, whom Hubbard married on April 3, 1837, with the Reverend Jason Lee presiding. In 1841, Hubbard participated in a cattle venture where he and others built a ship and sailed it to California where they sold it and purchased cattle to drive back to Oregon. In 1843, Hubbard participated in the Champoeg Meetings, where he served on several committees and voted for the creation of the Provisional Government of Oregon. Hubbard sailed for the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1845 on the brig Chenamus. A fellow traveler aboard, Gustavus Hines, complained that Hubbard and other passengers were neither \\"wise nor virtuous\\" for spending their time playing backgammon and card games. When the Cayuse War began in 1847 after the Whitman massacre, Hubbard built and donated a rifle and pistol to the government. Later he moved to Yamhill County where he built a sawmill. He died on April 24, 1877.

Thermophotonics was first publicly proposed by solar photovoltaic researcher Martin Green in 2000. However, no TPX device is known to have been demonstrated to date, apparently because of the stringent requirement on the emitter efficiency. A TPX system consists of a light-emitting diode (LED) (though other types of emitters are conceivable), a photovoltaic (PV) cell, an optical coupling between the two, and an electronic control circuit. The LED is heated to a temperature higher than the PV temperature by an external heat source. If no power is applied to the LED, the system functions much like a very inefficient TPV system, but if a forward bias is applied at some fraction of the bandgap potential, an increased number of electron-hole pairs (EHPs) will be thermally excited to the bandgap energy. These EHPs can then recombine radiatively so that the LED emits light at a rate higher than the thermal radiation rate (\\"superthermal\\" emission). This light is then delivered to the cooler PV cell over the optical coupling and converted to electricity. The control circuit presents a load to the PV cell (presumably at the maximum power point) and converts this voltage to a voltage level that can be used to sustain the bias of the emitter. Provided that the conversion efficiencies of electricity to light and light to electricity are sufficiently high, the power harnessed from the PV cell can exceed the power going into the bias circuit, and this small fraction of excess power (originating from the heat difference) can be utilized. It is thus in some sense a photonic heat engine. Possible applications of thermophotonic generators include solar thermal electricity generation and utilization of waste heat. TPX systems may have the potential to generate power with useful levels of output at temperatures where only thermoelectric systems are now practical, but with higher efficiency. A patent application for a thermophotonic generator using a vacuum gap with thickness on the order of a micrometer or less was published by the US Patent Office in 2009 and assigned to MTPV Corporation of Austin, Texas, USA. This proposed variant of the technology allows better thermal insulation because of the gap between the hot emitter and cold receiver, while maintaining relatively good optical coupling between them due to the gap's being small relative to the optical wavelength.

It was designed in Neoclassical style and is elaborately decorated.\\"The Old Senate Chamber.\\" Architect of the Capitol. Restored in 1976 as part of United States Bicentennial celebrations, it is preserved as a museum and for the Senate's use. Design and furnishings Located north of the Capitol rotunda on the second floor of the north wing (the Senate side) of the Capitol, the semicircular two-story room is wide and long, with a half-domed ceiling. The chamber is overlooked by two visitors' galleries. The Architect of the Capitol reports that the gallery on the east is \\"supported by eight Ionic columns of variegated marble quarried along the Potomac River\\", inspired by the Erechtheum of the Acropolis of Athens. Directly above this gallery hangs an 1823 \\"porthole portrait\\" of George Washington by Rembrandt Peale, which was purchased for display in the chamber in 1832 upon the centennial of Washington's birth. The second gallery is the Ladies' Gallery, which follows the curved western wall and is much larger. The Ladies' Gallery is supported by 12 steel columns \\"encased in cast-iron forms with Corinthian capitals, which were designed to simulate the cast-iron originals.\\" The gallery has a \\"wrought-iron balcony railing [that] follows the contour of the gallery and is backed by crimson fabric that accentuates the decorative metalwork.\\" On the dais in the center of the room is a curved table with \\"richly turned and carved legs and a crimson modesty screen\\" which serves as the desk of the President of the Senate (the Vice President of the United States). The crimson fabric is hung from a mahogany valence from a canopy overhead. The valence is below a carved gilt eagle and shield. Directly in front of the Vice President's desk one tier down is \\"a larger desk of similar design,\\" which was used by the Secretary of the Senate and Chief Clerk. A glass screen between the dais and a small lobby allowed Senators to relax but remain within earshot of the floor. In addition, there are two fireplace mantels on the east wall behind the screen, which are among the original pieces of the chamber that remain today. Two other mantels on the lobby's north and south ends are replicas, as the originals were replaced with stoves when the chamber was converted for the use of the Supreme Court of the United States. Radiating off the dais are desks and chairs for 64 Senators, which was the number of Senators at the time the Senate moved to its current quarters. The desks and chairs are located on four semicircular graduated platforms. When the Senate moved to its current chamber in 1859, it took the original furniture with it. Many of the original desks remain in use today, including the Daniel Webster and Jefferson Davis desks. The desks and chairs that are in the chamber today are replicas reproduced from a circa 1819 design by the New York City cabinetmaker Thomas Constantine. Like the originals, the furniture is mahogany. Behind the last row of desks is a low paneled wall separating the center of the chamber from a visitors' area (the third visitor area in the chamber, along with the two visitors' galleries). The area has red-upholstered sofas and was originally \\"reserved for privileged visitors who gained admittance to the Chamber through the special invitation of a Senator.\\" On either side of the main doorway are niches for coal- or wood-burning stoves; the current stoves are reproductions. The color scheme of crimson and gold, seen in the dais' decorations, can be seen elsewhere in the chamber as well, as in the \\"crimson drapery swags secured with gilt stars\\" in the visitors' galleries, crimson window treatments, and the carpet on the chamber floor, which is woven from long-staple virgin wool and has a \\"gold star pattern on a red background\\". The domed ceiling of the chamber is painted white. The Architect of the Capitol describes it as \\"elaborately coffered and enriched by decorative moldings.\\" In the center of the ceiling is a semicircular skylight, and around it are five smaller circular skylights. The skylight originally allowed natural light in the chamber, but today they are artificially lit. A large brass chandelier made by Philadelphia's Cornelius and Company also provided light; a reproduction now hangs above the Vice President's desk. Use by the Senate and Supreme Court View of Chamber from southwest The chamber was completed in 1810, after Architect of the Capitol Benjamin Henry Latrobe divided the original Senate chamber in the North wing into two rooms, one on the first floor and the other on the second. The bottom-floor chamber‚Äîknown as the Old Supreme Court Chamber‚Äîwas put into use as a chamber for the Supreme Court in 1810. In 1810‚Äîthe same year the Supreme Court moved into the lower floor‚Äîthe Senate moved into the second-story chamber. For the next 49 years, the Senate used the chamber until the completion of the north wing extension in 1859, when they moved to their present-day chamber. At its height, 64 senators met in the chamber. In 1860, after the Senate moved to its current quarters, the Supreme Court moved upstairs into Old Senate Chamber, where it sat until the completion of the United States Supreme Court building in 1935. Famous political cartoon of Brooks' attack on Sumner by J.L. Magee Many noted events occurred in the chamber. Among them are the passage of the 1820 Missouri Compromise, the 1830 Webster‚ÄìHayne debate, and the Webster-Clay- Calhoun debates over the Compromise of 1850. In 1856, Representative Preston Brooks beat Senator Charles Sumner nearly to death with a cane in the chamber. The attack occurred three days after Sumner, a strident abolitionist, attacked pro-slavery politicians, including Brooks' relative Senator Andrew Butler, in a speech. Brooks attacked Sumner as a matter of honor, beating him with a cane and injuring him so badly that he was absent from the Senate for nearly three years as he recovered. In a famous exchange in 1858, Senator James Henry Hammond of North Carolina gave a speech advancing the Mudsill theory, arguing that slavery was justified because civilization required a permanent underclass to serve as a foundation. In reply, Senator David C. Broderick, a Free Soil Democrat, pointed out that he himself had risen to the Senate from this \\"mudsill\\" class, and that his father, an Irish immigrant, had worked as a stonecutter in the construction of that very room: > If I were inclined to forget my connection with them, or to deny that I > sprang from them, this chamber would not be the place in which I could do > either. While I hold a seat I have but to look at the beautiful capitals > adorning the pilasters that support this roof, to be reminded of my father's > talent and to see his handiwork. Until 1976, the room was used for meetings, irregular congressional committee hearings, and as temporary quarters while the modern Senate chamber was being repaired in 1940, 1949, and 1950. Restoration The United States Bicentennial brought about the decision to restore the room to its antebellum appearance. At present, much of the room is furnished with reproductions with the exceptions of the gilded eagle ornament located above the chair of the President of the Senate (the Vice President of the United States), which is original, and above the eagle ornament on a third-story gallery resides an original portrait of George Washington by Rembrandt Peale. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the chamber was closed to tourists for almost two years due to security concerns; tour groups would have to pass close to the current Senate chamber and the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. It was later reopened after tightened security measures were put into place, with visitors being observed by two Capitol Police officers posted outside the room and allowed to \\"quickly file through the room\\" only when the Senate is not in session (usually Monday mornings and Friday afternoons). Modern use A mock Senate swearing-in ceremony for Hillary Clinton is held in the Old Senate Chamber in January 2001 The chamber is today used occasionally for ceremonial functions. Special meetings between Senators or dignitaries as well as speeches have been given there. Examples of such events include a speech by Walter Mondale in the Old Senate Chamber in September 2002, a meeting between Jesse Helms and visiting members of the United Nations Security Council in March 2000, and a speech by former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield to Senators and guests in March 1998. The room has been used by the press to take photos of Senators taking a mock oath of office. Senators are normally sworn- in in the current Senate chamber, where no photos are allowed.

Design Following closely to the winning formula that Levavasseur had introduced, the Antoinette V introduced a revised undercarriage, with a closely spaced pair of mainwheels at the rear of a carriage/skid which extended forward of the propeller, a tail-skid attached to the lower fin framework prevented damage to the tail section. Lateral stability on the ground was provided by outrigger wheels supported by a wire- braced framework at about half-span. The Antoinette V with R√©n√© Demanest at the controls Design and development A development of the Antoinette IV, the Antoinette V differed somewhat in having increased upper vertical tail area with no fabric covering the lower fin framework. The fuselage consisted of a wooden framework of triangular section covered with fabric, except in the cockpit area abreast the wing trailing edge. The wings were built in a similar fashion and were also covered in fabric. Control was affected by wheels either side of the pilot's seat for roll and pitch, and a rudder bar for yaw. The pilot operated a triangular elevator hinged to the tailing edge of the large tailplane, rhomboidal ailerons hinged from the trailing edges of the wingtips, and two triangular rudders above and below the tailplane. Delivered to R√©n√© Demanest, the Antoinette V proved easy to fly and enjoyed some success. Specifications (Antoinette V) See alsoNotesReferences * Further reading * * Munson, Kenneth.

He served as Archbishop of Bombay from 1950 until his death and was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 1953 by Pope Pius XII. Biography Valerian Gracias was born in Karachi, British India (in modern Pakistan), to Jos√© (d. 1902) and Carlota Gracias. His parents were from Dramapur/Navelim, Goa, working in Karachi. He studied at St. Patrick's High School in Karachi, St. Joseph Seminary in Mangalore, and the Pontifical Seminary of Kandy in Ceylon, where he obtained his doctorate in theology. Ordained to the priesthood on 3 October 1926, The interview is conducted in English. Gracias then did pastoral work in Bandra until November 1927, when he entered the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He finished his studies at the Gregorian in 1929 and became private secretary to Archbishop Joachim Lima SJ and diocesan chancellor of Bombay. He served as a preacher and pastor, and as the editor of various newspapers before being named the first Indian rector of Mumbai's Holy Name Cathedral in December 1941. On 16 May 1946, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Bombay and Titular bishop of Thennesus. Gracias received his episcopal consecration on the following 29 June from Archbishop Thomas Roberts SJ, with Bishops Victor Fernandes and Thomas Pothacamury as co-consecrators. Pope Pius XII promoted him to Archbishop of Bombay on 4 December 1950 to replace Roberts, a 57-year-old Englishman, who made way for the appointment of a native-born Indian. Gracias demonstrated his support of Goan nationalism and an opponent of Portuguese colonial rule by presented an image of the Virgin Mary as an indigenous Indian, at a time when the populace was still accustomed to European representations. On 29 November 1952 Pope Pius XII announced he would create 24 new cardinals, increasing the size of the College of Cardinals to 70 members, its maximum at the time. When one of those Pius named died on 28 December, the Vatican announced on 29 December that Gracias would be made a cardinal, the first from India. He was made Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria in Via Lata in the consistory of 12 January 1953. Gracias was considered to be a conservative. The Portuguese government denied reports that it was displeased with the honor bestowed upon Gracias. He was one of the 51 cardinal electors in the 1958 papal conclave and one of the 80 in the conclave of 1963. He attended the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), where he was one of 21 Council participants to present the closing messages of the Council on 8 December 1965. He hosted the first papal visit to India in 1964, when Pope Paul VI attended the International Eucharistic Congress in Bombay, preceded by a symposium of Catholic theologians to which he invited Hans K√ºng. He later said that Pope Paul VI's Bombay visit inspired his encyclical Populorum progressio (1967). In 1970 he was one of 15 prelates chosen to organize the 1971 Synod of Bishops, and he supported Pope Paul against critics of his approach to church governance and insistence of priestly celibacy. From 1954 to 1972, he was President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India and in 1972 helped overcome Vatican skepticism and win Pope Paul's approval of the formation of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. He fell ill in May 1978 and did not participate in the conclave of August 1978. Gracias died from cancer in Bombay 11 September 1978 at age 77. He was buried in Holy Name Cathedral in Mumbai. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award, second-highest civilian award of the Republic of India, on 26 January 1966.

Young is one of the few Latter-day Saints in history to have been ordained to the office of apostle without ever becoming a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles or the First Presidency of the church.David Whitmer was an ordained apostle but was never a member of either quorum. Some have also suggested that Martin Harris was an ordained apostle. See Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 6:320 and Heber C. Kimball, Journal of Discourses 6:29. Young was born in Kirtland, Ohio, the eldest child of Brigham Young and Mary Ann Angell. He was baptized into the church in Kirtland by his father at the age of eight. In 1847, Young travelled with his family and a group of Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo, Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley. Young was a missionary for the LDS Church in England from 1854 to 1856, working in Liverpool, Manchester, and Bradford. Upon his return to Utah Territory, Young married Margaret Whitehead, a native of England. She became his second wife. Over the next few years Young was involved in the lumber industry, running several saw mills in canyons by Salt Lake City. He was also one of the main promoters of the Utah Central Railroad.Andrew Jenson, Latter-day Saints Biographical Encyclopedia vol. 1, pp. 518‚Äì19. In 1864, Brigham Young privately ordained two of his sons‚ÄîBrigham Young, Jr. and Joseph Angell‚Äîto the priesthood office of apostle, without a public announcement or adding them to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Brigham had also previously ordained his son John Willard Young an apostle in 1855. Unlike his two brothers, Joseph Angell would never become a member of the First Presidency nor, like Brigham Jr., a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Joseph Angell was active in territorial politics and was a member of the Utah Territory's House of Representatives in its 6th, 11th, and 12th sessions and was a member of the territory's upper chamber in its 14th through 19th sessions.

He was an elder brother of Brigham Young. Young was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, the eighth child born to John Young and Abigail (Nabby) Howe. Brigham, Phineas H., Joseph, and John. In 1830, while he was a preacher for the Methodist Church in Upper Canada, Young was introduced to the Book of Mormon by his younger brother Brigham. Joseph eventually abandoned the Methodist faith and was baptized a member of the Church of Christ by Daniel Bowen in Columbia, Pennsylvania, on April 6, 1832; Brigham followed his brother and became a member of the church one week later. Later in April 1832, Joseph was ordained to the priesthood office of elder by Ezra Landon. Immediately following his ordination, Young began a mission for the church, preaching in New York and Upper Canada in the spring and summer of 1832 with his brother Phineas. Missions In November 1832, Young joined the gathering of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, where he met Joseph Smith, the founder of the church. Shortly after arriving in Kirtland, Smith asked Young to depart on another mission for the church to Upper Canada, which he served over the winter months of 1832 and 1833. On February 18, 1834, Young married Jane Adeline Bicknell in Geneseo, New York.Individual Record: Joseph Young. familysearch.org The couple would eventually have eleven children. Seventy Young accompanied Joseph Smith and others in a journey to Independence, Missouri, in 1834 as part of Zion's Camp. In 1835, Smith selected Young to be one of the leaders of the Seventy of the church. Young was ordained to the office of Seventy on February 28 and was ordained as one of the seven presidents of the First Quorum of the Seventy on March 1. After it was discovered that the senior president of the Seventy, Hazen Aldrich, had previously been ordained to the office of high priest, Aldrich surrendered his position in the quorum. As a result, Young became the senior or seventh president of the Seventy. He would retain this position in the church from 1835 until his death. As a Seventy, Young served several more missions for the church, including one to New York and Massachusetts with Burr Riggs in 1835 and one to his relatives in the eastern United States with his brother Brigham in 1836. Young participated in many significant events in early Latter Day Saint history. He was present at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple in 1836. Young was also present at Haun's Mill, Missouri, when it was attacked by those who opposed the Mormon presence in Missouri. He left Missouri with the Latter Day Saints in consequence of the extermination order which had been issued by Lilburn W. Boggs. Young received his endowment in Nauvoo, Illinois, on February 3, 1844, just months before Joseph Smith was killed. He was selected by Smith as an inaugural member of the Council of Fifty on March 1, 1844. When Smith was killed on June 27, 1844, Young was campaigning in Ohio on behalf of Smith's bid for the presidency of the United States. Like many early Latter Day Saints, Young practiced plural marriage. On January 16, 1846, he was married to Lucinda Allen and Lydia Caroline Hagar, in the Nauvoo Temple. Soon to follow was Mary Ann Huntley on February 6, 1846. Later, on 7 April 1868 he married Sarah Jane Snow, and Elizabeth Stevens on November 28, 1868. Young would eventually father a total of ten children with his plural wives. Later life in Utah Young and his four wives left Illinois in 1846 and settled in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, and later Carterville, Iowa. He and his wives left Carterville in 1850 to join the Latter Day Saints who had followed his brother Brigham to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah Territory. Young arrived in Salt Lake City in September 1850. The Youngs travelled in the Wilford Woodruff pioneer company. In 1870, Young served a final mission for the church to the British Isles. He died at, and was buried in, Salt Lake City at the age of 84. At the time of his death, Young had served as a general authority or a missionary of the church for nearly fifty years. See also *S.

An affiliate of York College of Pennsylvania, it is the living legacy of the York County Academy founded in 1787.  History  York Country Day School was founded in 1953 on Springettsbury Avenue, led by Mr. Henry M. Thornton Sr. and assisted by Headmaster Mr. Kenneth Snyder. The original house was purchased for $15,000 and renovated for another $15,000. Thirty-nine students enrolled, and teachers were hired to instruct sixth through ninth grade in all subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, history, French and Latin. After two years, the house on Springettsbury reached its capacity. In need of more space for more students and a set of athletic fields, Mr. George Whiteley generously donated 10 acres of land on Regents Glen Boulevard. He later donated another 5 acres, to complete the current 15-acre footprint. In 1956, the school officially opened and classes began with seventh through 12th grades filled. A year later, In 1957, the first YCDS all-female class of 13 students graduated from high school. As years passed, the school continued to expand to include grades one through six. In 1976, York Country Day School and York College of Pennsylvania combined operational efforts under one organization. In the mid nineteen- eighties, the YCP Board of Trustees created the comprehensive Plan for Excellence to guide the school through its fourth decade and beyond, and the first phase of that plan was completed with the construction of a preschool wing, science laboratory, and lower level dining and athletic facilities. The second phase of the plan focused on a new curriculum that emphasized academics, expanded extracurricular activities, and athletic opportunities. The Board of Trustees augmented the school's graduation requirements and added more language, social studies, and science to the curriculum, and a new preschool program for 2- and 3-year-olds. All of these improvements were designed to prepare students for admission to the most demanding institutions of higher learning. In 1990, the Multi-Purpose Room was completed. This provided space for lunch, small dramatic productions, physical education, social events and athletic practices. In 1992, a strategic plan was adopted to enhance and update the facilities, as well as to grow enrollment. A big year for York Country Day came in 1994, when the East Wing of the upper school was completed, that included six classrooms, an additional science lab, office and commons area. Big changes for York Country Day came in the 21st century, starting in 2014, when the 13th Head of School Dr. Christine Heine successfully launched a $14.6-million campaign that the York College Board of Trustees unanimously approved. This strategic plan supports the already rigorous program in place through the construction of the Ann B. Barshinger Center for the Arts and the Brougher Center for Innovation and Technology in the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics) building. The STEAM center includes a Robotics and Bionics lab, VidCast Studio, Digital Arts Workshop, Metal and Wood shops, numerous collaborative learning spaces and much more. In 2016, the school entrance shifts from Regents Glen Boulevard to Indian Rock Dam Road, creating a dramatic new entry way for drop-off and pickup. Renovation to the Upper and Middle Level classrooms and the creation of an outdoor classroom in lower school are part of the construction, as well as numerous collaborative learning spaces. In Spring 2017, the final renovations in the Upper and Middle schools were complete.

The story follows Johnny Smith, who awakens from a coma of nearly five years and now experiences clairvoyant and precognitive visions triggered by touch. These visions have limitations and when information is beyond his perception, Johnny refers to that information as being trapped in the part of his brain that is permanently damaged, \\"the dead zone.\\" The novel also follows the life of Greg Stillson, a rising politician, and a serial killer in Castle Rock, both of whom are evils Johnny must eventually face. Though earlier King books were successful, The Dead Zone was the first of his novels to rank among the ten best-selling novels of the year in the United States.James W. Hall. Hit Lit: Cracking the Code of the Twentieth Century‚Äôs Biggest Bestsellers. Random House, 2012 The book was nominated for the Locus Award in 1980 and was dedicated to King's son Owen. The Dead Zone is the first story by King to feature the fictional town of Castle Rock, which serves as the setting for several later stories and is referenced in others. The TV series Castle Rock takes place in this fictional town and makes references to the Strangler whom Johnny helped track down in The Dead Zone. The book spawned a 1983 film adaptation as well as a television series. In the novel, the phrase \\"dead zone\\" refers to the part of Johnny Smith's brain that is damaged beyond repair, resulting in his dormant psychic potential awakening. In the movie adaptation starring Christopher Walken, the phrase \\"dead zone\\" refers to blind spots in his precognitive visions that represent the future is capable of being altered. In the TV series starring Anthony Michael Hall, the phrase \\"dead zone\\" refers to the dormant part of Johnny's brain that awakens and is the direct source of his psychic power. Plot summary As a child in 1953, Johnny Smith falls unconscious while ice-skating, then mumbles a prophetic warning to an adult who later suffers an accident. In an unconnected incident, a young, emotionally troubled door-to-door Bible salesman named Greg Stillson vindictively kicks a dog to death. By 1970, Johnny is a high school teacher in the small town of Cleaves Mills, Maine with a girlfriend named Sarah. After winning repeatedly at a carnival wheel of fortune, Johnny is involved in a car accident and falls into a coma. Waking up over four years later, Johnny finds that he has suffered a neural injury, with one part of his brain seriously damaged, making it a \\"dead zone.\\" His medical scans show that other parts of the brain have awakened with heightened activity. Johnny now sometimes experiences clairvoyant visions after touching people and objects. After helping various people, Johnny becomes frustrated by sensationalistic media reports of his supposed psychic talents. After he rejects a lucrative offer from tabloid reporter Richard Dees to run fake predictions under Johnny's name, Dees' paper maliciously prints a story denouncing Johnny as a fraud. Relieved, Johnny hopes to resume a normal life as a teacher despite ongoing, severe headaches. Eventually, Sheriff George Bannerman of Castle Rock asks him to help catch a local serial killer. After a nine-year-old girl is murdered, Johnny reluctantly identifies the killer as Bannerman's deputy Frank Dodd, who commits suicide after leaving a confession. As Johnny feared, the incident reignites the public's interest in his power. Stillson, now a successful businessman and mayor of Ridgeway, New Hampshire, threatens to kill the people he bullies if they reveal his actions. In 1976, he wins a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as an independent, having blackmailed a local businessman into raising funds for him. When Johnny proves too controversial to return to teaching, he becomes a private tutor in Ridgeway and develops an interest in politics. He meets Stillson, and is horrified to see a vision of an older Stillson, who is eventually elected President and causes a massive, worldwide nuclear conflict. As Johnny's health worsens, he contemplates how to prevent Stillson's presidency and compares the matter to whether, if time travel were possible, one should kill Hitler in 1932. Eventually, he concludes assassinating Stillson is the only way to be sure the vision does not come true, but he procrastinates. Johnny rationalizes his inaction because of doubt in his vision, abhorrence of murder, and his belief that there is no urgent need to act immediately. An FBI agent who had been investigating Stillson is killed by a car bomb, and Johnny's warnings fail to save everyone from a disaster at his pupil's graduation party. Now believing that he must take more decisive action to prevent his visions, Johnny buys a rifle and resolves to kill Stillson at his next rally, aided by the grim knowledge that his headaches are the result of a brain tumor. At the rally, Stillson begins his speech. Johnny shoots at Stillson but misses and is wounded by Stillson's bodyguards. Before he can fire again, Stillson grabs a young child and holds him up as a human shield. Johnny pauses, unable to shoot, and is shot twice by the bodyguards, falls off the balcony, and is mortally wounded. A bystander photographs Stillson's act, and, when published, the picture destroys Stillson's political career and his chances of becoming president. Dying, Johnny touches Stillson a final time but feels only dwindling impressions and knows that the terrible future has been prevented. An epilogue intersperses excerpts of letters from Johnny to his loved ones, a \\"Q & A\\" transcript of a purported Senate committee (chaired by real-life Maine Senator William Cohen) investigation of Johnny's attempt to assassinate Stillson, and a narrative of Sarah's visit to Johnny's grave. Sarah feels a brief moment of psychic contact with Johnny's spirit and, comforted, drives away.  Reception  Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times compared reading the novel to the experience of watching \\"a particularly compelling movie\\", which he said is evidence of the novel's entertainment value, even if it does not speak of its literary value. The Washington Posts reviewer wrote, \\"It is not a book that will please everyone, but those who like it will probably like it a lot.\\" In a retrospective review, James Smythe of The Guardian wrote that The Dead Zone had become one of his favorite King novels after rereading it. Smythe said that although the novel seems to have no clear antagonist throughout the first two-thirds, it reveals itself as \\"a more literary novel about rehabilitation and loss\\". Adaptations=Film In 1983, the novel was adapted by screenwriter Jeffrey Boam into a film of the same name, starring Christopher Walken as Johnny and Martin Sheen as Greg Stillson. It was directed by David Cronenberg. Television The television series The Dead Zone began broadcasting in late 2002. Starring Anthony Michael Hall as Johnny, Nicole de Boer as Sarah, and Sean Patrick Flanery as Greg Stillson. The series aired on the USA Network and gave Johnny and Sarah a son, born during Johnny's coma, but in the book, Johnny and Sarah had only kissed before his accident. In the series, Johnny forms a friendship with his physical therapist Bruce, who aids him in his adventures and his investigation of Stillson. An episode exploring how life would have been if Johnny and Bruce never met depicts a timeline similar to the novel, where Johnny becomes an isolated loner who then attempts to assassinate Stillson in public.

It is a sequel to Panzer General. Players can progress through four campaigns as an Allied general against Axis forces controlled by the computer. In Germany, Allied General was titled Panzer General II, and Panzer General II was named Panzer General IIID. Gameplay The playable campaigns include: *a Soviet campaign, which features the Soviet invasion of Finland, known as the Winter War, the defenses of Moscow, and if successful, the counter-attack *a British campaign in North Africa against the German and Italian armies, beginning in Sidi Barrani *a British campaign, which can be played as the continuation of the first British campaign, which features the final Allied attack in Tunis on Mareth Line and the invasion of Europe *an American campaign, similar to the second British campaign, that begins with Operation Torch and continues to the invasion of Europe Individual scenarios can be played from either side. Whereas the first Panzer General targeted DOS, Allied General was made for Windows. Allied General and Panzer General for Windows (an update to the DOS version) utilize a pop-up interface and share an underlying file system that differs from the original Panzer General. Fans created a version of Allied General, based on its own DOS version, that borrows interface features from the original Panzer General. Called Allied Panzer General, it includes all scenarios and campaigns from the original, as well as bugfixes. Reception Allied General sold at least 50,000 units by September 1997. Reviewing the Windows version, a Next Generation critic summarized that, \\"Panzer General was one of the best-loved war games of last year, and Allied General is an improvement on an already great engine. For a sequel to such a prestigious title, however, there's really not much new here.\\" He was pleased with the new Windows-specific features, such as being able to keep several windows open at once and change the game's resolution, as well as the improved e-mail play. He criticized that the weak AI is unimproved from Panzer General, but concluded the game to be worth getting for war game enthusiasts. Next Generation also reviewed the PlayStation version, opining that it \\"boasts much of what made [Panzer General] such a delight\\".

Climbing specialization Hersey specialized in unroped \\"free solo\\" climbing, often in the 5.10‚Äì5.11 range; he died during such a free solo climb. Few climbers have tried to repeat his achievements, which include many of Colorado's hardest traditional routes. Background Originally from Stretford, Greater Manchester, England, Hersey referred to Eldorado Canyon as his 'office', where he could be seen on any day of the week, if not on a road trip to Yosemite National Park or elsewhere. He also referred to Boulder, Colorado's Liquor Mart as 'The Shrine', and described his climbing-chalk bag as 'my bag of courage'. Hersey was featured in Climbing MagazineClimbing, April/May 1992, quoted in Ghiglieri and Farabee. and posthumously in the film Front Range Freaks. He was tall and weighed . He spoke with a strong Manchester accent. Hersey was introduced to climbing by his father, who went hiking near Manchester every week. Hersey learned to climb on the gritstone of the Peak District National Park in Derbyshire. In 1983, after being unemployed for five years in England, Hersey decided to travel to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life. Hersey's efforts to push the limits of his sport earned him the nickname \\"Dr. Death\\". Hersey was perhaps best known for his exploits in Eldorado Canyon, but his r√©sum√© included many other challenging ascents (and descents). Among them was his free-solo ascent of Crack of Fear, a sustained 5.10+ off-width route at Lumpy Ridge, Colorado; and an impressive effort on the Diamond (a wall on Longs Peak), when he free- soloed ascents of two routes and downclimbed another in a single day.

Females are about long and males are . Their bodies are flat with an argent-colored luster. However, males change to a reddish (sometimes purple) color during the spawning season (March to September) which functions to attract females.

Ecology and reproductive system Rosy bitterlings live in ponds (reservoirs) where freshwater mussels are abundant. Farm ponds are an important habitat for not only rosy bitterlings, but also mussels and plankton. Freshwater mussels play an important role in rosy bitterling reproduction. The female rosy bitterling has a unique pipe about the same length as its own body, used for laying eggs on a specific spot of mussels. Usually, two or three eggs are laid at once and placed on the gill of the mussel. A male spawns into the gill cavity of the mussels right after a female lays eggs to ensure fertilization.Kanoh, Y. 2000. Reproductive success associated with territoriality, sneaking, and grouping in male Rosy Bitterlings, Rhodeus ocellatus (Pisces: Cyprinidae). Env. Biol. Fish. 57: 143-154 Normally, a female lays eggs repeatedly at 6- to 9-day intervals about 10 times in a season. Eggs grow in the mussels' gills and juveniles stay inside the mussel about 15 to 30 days after fertilization. Eggs hatch after about three days when juveniles are about 2.8 mm long. The body has a unique shape resembling the bud of a matsutake mushroom. Juveniles swim out of the mussel from the margin of the excurrent siphon. At this point, juveniles are about 7.5 mm long and about the same shape as adults.Nagata, Y. 1976. Reproductive behavior of a bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus (Kner). Physiol. Ecol.

He spent seventeen years, starting with a pro se action against the city, then as lead plaintiff, in multiple successful federal court challenges to remove the high cross from this government owned land. Although removal was favored by successive court rulings, various tactics, including referendums, appeals and finally removing the underlying land to federal ownership prevented removing the cross. Personal life Paulson grew up in the village of Clayton, Wisconsin, and had two older brothers and two younger sisters. He had been married for a brief period but did not have any children. Education Paulson earned a bachelor's degree in Journalism and master's degrees in Public Administration and the Management of Information Systems. Military service Paulson enlisted in the U.S. Army aged 18 in 1966, becoming a paratrooper, and served two tours of duty in Vietnam, including on Hill 875 in the Battle of Dak To, where his platoon was ambushed and he and a fellow soldier were the only survivors. Life after the military After returning from Vietnam, he attended the University of Wisconsin and took a sociology of religion class. Paulson worked in various professions after returning from Vietnam, as a journalist, in shipyards, oil fields, and apple orchards. In the late 1970s, Paulson moved to San Diego and was a professor at National University where he taught business and computing classes. In 2003 he signed the Humanist Manifesto. Involvement in the Mount Soledad Cross Controversy Paulson spent seventeen years arguing that the cross violated the separation of church and state interpretation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the No Preference Clause of the California Constitution. His detractors, led by the only daily newspaper in the city, The San Diego Union Tribune, depicted him as a man on a mission to deny the expression of the majority's religious preference. In numerous articles and letters to the editor he was invariably referred to as \\"Atheist Philip Paulson\\", with rarely a mention of his veteran status, having served two combat tours in Viet Nam. Mr. Paulson described his experiences as an atheist in Viet Nam in the article I Was an Atheist in a Foxhole for the American Humanist Association in the September/October 1989 issue of The Humanist magazine. Death and Union Tribune interview He refused interviews and public speaking, except for a single interview with the Union Tribune when he learned that he had terminal liver cancer. Upon his death at the age of 59 on October 25, 2006, the newspaper that had led the attacks against him printed his obituary. It contained this quote, which summarized his motivation: > ‚ÄúI fought in Vietnam and I thought I fought to maintain freedom and yet the > cross savers in this city would have us believe all of the veterans' > sacrifices are in vain, that the Constitution is something to be spit on,‚Äù > Mr. Paulson said. ‚ÄúThe real message is equal treatment under the law, and > religious neutrality. That's the purpose of why I did it. It has nothing to > do with me being an atheist. The fact is, the Constitution calls for no > preference and that's why every judge ruled for me.‚Äù When it became known that Paulson had only months to live, his friends and supporters organized a luncheon to honor him. Over a hundred people, including national leaders of the movement to preserve separation of church and state, attended. Among the many expressions of appreciation, this one is available, showing Paulson (hair missing due to chemotherapy) in the audience. In October 2006, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, at its annual convention in San Francisco, gave Paulson its first \\"Atheist in a Foxhole\\" award. He attended although he was barely able to travel due to his deteriorating health.

The story centres around Strauss (a vampire king) and follows his search for his queen who has been sealed away by humans unable to defeat her thousands of years ago. As this takes him to his set-aside Kingdom of the Night where he encounters dhampirs (half human, half vampire), and humans out to stop the reuniting of the King and Queen at any means possible. The story was serialized in Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan and has been collected into nine tank≈çbon published by Square Enix. VIZ Media released The Record of a Fallen Vampire from May 13, 2008 to May 4, 2010. Plot Having cast aside his Kingdom of the Night a thousand years ago, the vampire king Strauss wanders the lands in search of the place where his queen was sealed. Dogged by the dhampires who are out to kill him, Strauss is fighting against time as he must continuously face humanity's curse, the Black Swan. Initially, the story focuses on introducing Strauss and his quest for the seal, while fighting against the Black Swan and the dhampires. The main plot, which gradually emerges after volume two,In volume three, GM Gozen informs the dhampires of the crisis. revolves around repelling an alien invasion. The humans plan to use Strauss' powers and Adelheid's powers to repel the invaders before having the Black Swan finally dispose of them. Bridget, Strauss and Adelheid use flashbacks to convey their perspective on the events a thousand years ago. The writer, Kyo Shirodaira, indicates that this method of deriving different truths from the same set of facts was inspired by Christianna Brand's storytelling techniques.Volume 3 afterword.  Characters = Vampires  Vampire king Strauss :Age: ~around 1250 (he became king around the very young age of 200 and adopted Bridget around 60 years old) :Strauss is the fearsome Vampire king Akabara (lit. Red Rose) who cast aside his kingdom a thousand years ago and went to search for Adelheid's seal and free her. While the other dhampires believe his motive is deep love for his queen, Bridget believes that Strauss wants to find Adelheid so he can personally kill her as revenge for killing Stella. Strauss is somber but compassionate and does not kill without reason. He is also unusually cool and logical which allows him to master both the politics and the art of war with frightening precision. Strauss was seen by many as a god and thus great things were expected of him. Few ever stopped to think about his personal life as he devoted himself to his duties as general and later king. The many mysteries in the series revolve around him and the mysterious fall of his kingdom 1000 years ago. All attempts to pry information from him failed, and he resents the attempts to bring up the unhappy past. :Before becoming king, Strauss was a general of the Kingdom of the Night. During that time he adopted and raised Bridget, a dhampire girl. He was also in love with a human girl, Stella, whom he presented with a pendant made from lunar rock which he collected himself. Later it is revealed that Strauss never loved Adelheid, and that his true love interest was only Stella. As the general, Strauss had never been defeated on the field of battle; because his exceptional leadership of the armies, the Kingdom of Night went without a loss for over 100 years. While he was a general, Strauss had the cunning and power to be able to control the entire continent. He chose not to, however, because he was content with the size of the Kingdom. He also knew that if he conquered more, the people will hate the Kingdom and rebel, causing the loss of many lives, which would be unacceptable. These same skills were taught to Bridget. :Strauss has impressive magical powers far outmatching those of the dhampires. Nevertheless, he chooses to limit his power and fight in close combat in order to avoid damage to the surroundings. He is usually seen fighting with a vibrating edge of magic, although he can also summon a sword and is an expert swordsman. At range, Strauss can cast vibrating magic arrows or destroy missiles with a single gesture of his hand. Although pure-blooded vampires perish when exposed to sunlight, Strauss has overcome this limitation long ago.Vanpaia J≈´ji Kai vol.6, page 183. :Despite for being extremely powerful, Strauss is very kind hearted, gentle and has compassion for everyone except himself. It is later revealed that he abandoned his kingdom and turned himself into the ultimate enemy so both human and vampire races will collaborate and stop fighting each other, continuing to carry everyone's resentment for him for over 1000 years to protect everyone. Queen Adelheid :Age: 1190 :Strauss' queen and Bridget's half-sister, Adelheid was sealed a thousand years ago when she went berserk and unleashed her power, the . Though unskilled in the use of her magic, Adelheid is potentially more powerful than Strauss and her magic possesses terraforming capabilities; the corrosive nature of her powers resulted from unleashing it all at once and she, like Strauss, is not limited by exposure to sunlight. Legend says that she went berserk when she thought that the king had been killed, though Bridget believes that Adelheid was frightened and thought Strauss was going to kill her when he believed Adelheid had killed Stella and her unborn child. Nobody knew that she had witnessed Stella‚Äôs death until Adelheid officially became Strauss‚Äô queen. :Adelheid had a shy and self-conscious personality and she always worried about how others thought of her. Unlike Bridget or Strauss, Adelheid does not possess an exceptional amount of brains or cunning. By comparison, Adelheid was the least skilled of the three but since she was the only pure-blooded daughter of the king, Adelheid was the only one who could become queen. When Adelheid first learned that Bridget was her sister, the future queen felt very guilty over the circumstances of her birth. Adelheid always tried to make it up to Bridget by calling the dhampire ‚Äòdear sister‚Äô and she and Bridget became close. After she is reawakened, she strives to atone for her weakness and past mistakes, particularly in regards to Stella's death, the deterioration of the Kingdom of the Night, and Strauss' downfall. Gottfried :The vampire king that preceded Strauss as monarch. Gottfried is the biological father of Bridget and Adelheid. Like most rulers of the Kingdom of the Night, he became king at the age of 1000. Gottfried is an intelligent man that commanded the nation for several hundred years. As a pure-blood, it was difficult for Gottfried to produce offspring. Thus, when Bridget was born, she was allowed to be princess and heir in the off chance that Gottfried died. As soon as Adelheid was born, Gottfried banished his older daughter in order to prevent civil war between the two children.  Dhampires  Those who have both vampire and human blood are referred to as dhampires. All dhampires, except Laetitia, have united under Bridget against Strauss and his quest for the seal. : Age: 1200 : Bridget is the leader of the dhampire community, a highly capable and powerful dhamphir who has been fighting Strauss for over a thousand years. Bridget has set up thousands of 'nets' all over the world that allows her to track the activities of Strauss and she is highly organized and efficient. In battle, Bridget acts as the strategist, directing the other dhampires‚Äô attacks. Her knowledge of her adversary, Strauss, is second to none. : Bridget was adopted by Strauss when he was still a general, and raised like his own daughter; he was personally responsible for cultivating Bridget's abilities. According to Tessenji, Bridget's skill in the area of politics as well as her abilities with a sword, is the only reason that the dhampire survived after Strauss abdicated. Bridget is an expert in small group combat, and she has a keen military intelligence and excellent political sense. Despite the fact that she was only 150 and was a dhampire, she later served as one of his most trusted generals. Nevertheless, Strauss left her behind when he abandoned his kingdom. : Despite her history with Strauss, Bridget keeps her personal feelings and that of the dhampire community separate. There are several instances where Bridget allows herself to feel angry that she is not helping Strauss. While serving the Kingdom of the Night, the only thing that separated her from becoming Strauss' lover is the family-like status they had. Though initially jealous that Stella was taking her place in Strauss' life, Bridget later tolerated and eventually grew to respect Stella. As Stella was human and would live a considerably shorter life than her children, Bridget had planned to raise Stella's dhamphir children with Strauss as a surrogate mother. Once the truth behind events that happened a thousand years ago comes to light, she apologizes to Strauss and returns to him as his daughter. : Age: ~600 : One of Bridget's followers and the best swordsman in the group; his skills are noted by Bridget to be greater than her own. After Strauss defeats Yuki, the 49th Black Swan and Renka's love interest, Renka swears to avenge her. However, Renka‚Äôs hatred is so great that he will not hesitate in revealing the existence of dhampire and vampires to the entire human world, which would rekindle the vampire hunts. In a reckless fight against Strauss, Renka was unable to hit the vampire king even once while Strauss cut Renka 25 times. Renka realizes exactly how heavy Strauss‚Äô mental burden is, and the dhampire knows that he could never win against the former king armed only with pure rage. Afterwards, Renka starts to retain his composure and becomes curious of Strauss‚Äô past and is direct in asking Bridget about the king‚Äôs past. : In combat, Renka uses two sacred swords, Kory≈´ and Kinyou as well as Narutsuki, a sacred katana capable of disrupting the spirit powers of Strauss and the Black Swan. Despite four hundred years of training, his swordsmanship is still unrefined and lacking compared to that of Strauss. For Kayuki's final battle against Strauss, he lends her Narutsuki so she will not feel as though her victory is decided against the vampire king merely because she is the Black Swan. : Age: ~600 : One of the dhampires on Bridget's team. He wears a full- body samurai armor suit. In his free time, Tessenji runs a food stall that has good food but few patrons due to his armor. Tessenji is well versed in the daily workings of the dhampire community and its rumors. In fighting, Tessenji is equally skilled in using a long spear for close range fighting and a bow and arrow set to strike from a distance. He rarely speaks but is the tallest and most forbidding of the dhampire fighting team. He is the only dhampire to see Strauss' duel against Renka and is terrified that the vampire could beat Renka so easily by swordsmanship alone. : Age: ~ almost 300 : Nicknamed Ethel, Takahashi is youngest dhampire on Bridget's team. He has the appearance of a high school student and fights using a large scythe that excels in wide area damage. He is still relatively new to fighting Strauss and hesitates when forced to hurt children like Laetitia. He has very little vampire blood in him; therefore, he is best suited to traveling in daylight. Thus, Takahashi commonly runs errands for Bridget, which includes bringing data from the dhamphires‚Äô information department. He frequents Tessenji's food stand. : Age: 68 : A dhampire orphan girl who gave Strauss refuge at her mountain home during his battle against the 49th Black Swan. Laetitia is only quarter vampire, being the child of a dhampire and a human. She later accompanies Strauss and becomes his charge and loyal companion. Unlike other dhampires, Laetitia has little magical or spiritual ability and relies more on firearms with bullets infused with Strauss' magic. While she is the weakest of the dhampires seen, she is still able to outfly a military helicopter. Laetitia acts as Strauss' eyes and ears when the vampire king cannot move about freely. She is also the only one who believes in Strauss even after learning from Bridget of Strauss‚Äô betrayal. Bridget nicknames Laetitia 'Mountain Cat' and personally begins training Laeticia's dhamphir powers so she won't be a hindrance.  Black Swan  The Black Swan is a curse created by humans to seek out and destroy Strauss. It is a spiritual parasite; its host is usually young, beautiful girls. It travels from host to host, forcing the wielder to hunt Strauss or die within five years, and it carries the memories and spiritual power of all previous hosts. The Black Swan will continue to exist until the Vampire King and his queen are eliminated; thus, the only way for the host of the Black Swan to survive is for both Strauss and Adelheid to die. The initial catalyst for the spell was Stella and her unborn child, who were killed by Maria Saberhagen to create the Black Swan. : Age: 17 : The 50th Black Swan, the first Black Swan to be able to surpass Strauss and completely neutralize his power; however, her lack of control over her powers means that she cannot defeat the Dhamphires. Though she wants to protect her grandfather by controlling the Vampire King, Kayuki is often unsettled by Strauss' enigmatic nature. Her face bears an uncanny resemblance to Yuki and Stella Hazelburke, although their personalities are quite different. Like her grandfather, Kayuki was first introduced wearing a mask because she was ‚Äòshy‚Äô. She is usually seen wearing a kimono. While Kayuki is extremely mature for her age, she is not always in perfect control of herself. It is eventually revealed that she was an ordinary girl who was badly injured and paralyzed during an accident. Inheriting the Black Swan curse healed all her injuries and GM Gozen appeared, claiming to be her grandfather and guiding her as she learned her new abilities as the Black Swan. Beneath her stoic demeanor, she had been secretly thrilled at the thought of being a hero, saving the world from vampires. : Kayuki sometimes delves into the Black Swan's accumulated memories to gain a better understanding of Strauss; however, the Black Swan has few memories of who Strauss is as a person. Kayuki knows that such actions will cut her already shortened lifespan. She has shown several instances of sympathizing with Strauss and wanting to learn more about him as a human, even to the point that she doubts her goals. These actions eventually make it hard for her to kill him. Strauss is aware of her shortening lifespan in pursuit of knowledge and warns her against it, trying to force her to view him as an enemy rather than a friend in order to spare her the pain when his death comes. On several occasions, Kayuki attacks Strauss out of anger or in an attempt to discipline the disobedient vampire king. Her level of stress continues to build because of the tension from watching Strauss and the extensive use of the Black Swan‚Äôs powers. Strauss predicts she will die far sooner to than any of the previous Black Swans. : The 49th Black Swan; the first to be as powerful as Strauss. Renka knew her even before she became the Black Swan and while he cared deeply for her, she regarded him as a hapless younger brother. Her death serves as the catalyst for Renka's revenge oath and deteriorating mental condition. Even though she is underage, Yuki appears to have grown addicted to smoking cigarettes. After her death, Renka started carrying her favorite lighter even though it has long since run out of fluid. Despite her bleak future and suffering, she remained cheerful and optimistic; had his child lived, Strauss believes that she would have grown to become like Yuki. Because of Kayuki's strong resemblance to Yuki, Renka initially finds her presence unsettling. : Age: 17 : The 2nd Black Swan. She appeared thirteen years after the first and was terrified of the curse. : The 1st Black Swan. The adopted daughter of Maria Saverhagen, she calmly accepted her situation. She met Bridget, was killed by Akabara a year afterward. At that time, the Black Swan was only able to deflect half of Bridget‚Äôs attack, which shredded all her clothes. When she is defeated by Strauss, he realizes the true nature of the Black Swan and its connection to Stella and his unborn child.  Humans  : GM Gozen is the leader of the human world and Kayuki's grandfather. He claims that GM stands for Great Mask. He plans to use Strauss and Adelheid to destroy the aliens attempt to invade the Earth before finishing them off. Gozen admits that the most frightening moment in his life was when he had to match wits with Strauss. Strauss' death is his top priority and thus commands Morishima to tell his granddaughter lies to ensure that she is willing to kill the vampire king. He is absolutely sure that Kayuki has the power and brains to kill Strauss at any time without question. : The military person assigned by GM Gozen and in charge of repelling the alien invasion. He has a sharp mind and is the first person to discern the truth behind Strauss' motives relating to the fall of the Kingdom of the Night. Despite his laid back attitude and unimposing appearance, he is a formidable man whom Bridget respects. : A scientist working on the shuttle project to prevent the aliens of the Fio Civilization from taking over the Earth. She is an energetic young woman who becomes fascinated by Kayuki and Strauss' abilities. She and reluctant Li eventually agree to help Strauss collect information when his actions are limited from being forced to stay on the research facility's island. However, Nazuna remains suspicious of Strauss' true motives. : One of the scientists working on the shuttle project at the research facility along with his partner, Nazuna. He is amazed by Strauss' intelligence and ability to understand the science and engineering involved with the space mission and allows Strauss to offer suggestions to improve. Li becomes frightened of the vampire king when it is revealed that Strauss cannot be harmed by the sun, but diligently agrees to Strauss' challenge to determine what stone was used to make Stella's necklace in exchange for Strauss agreeing to save the Earth from the alien invaders. Stella : Age: 18 : A country girl who could neither read nor write. While Strauss was still a general, she was his human lover and Strauss continues to carry a pendant he made for her when she was alive. She was adopted by the Hazelberg family prior to her marriage to Strauss. Stella and her unborn child (Strauss was the child‚Äôs father) were later brutally murdered; their deaths forever plunged Strauss into a depth of despair. The circumstances of her death become a long-standing mystery of the series, which are eventually fully disclosed to the audience through Adelheid's confession and later when Stella herself tells Kayuki how it occurred: She was killed by Maria Saberhagen and used as a catalyst to create the Black Swan. While her unborn daughter, who carried the blood of Strauss, would have the potential power to someday defeat Strauss, Stella was sacrificed as well as her consciousness at the core of the Black Swan was required to keep the infant child's temperament in check. Because Stella and her baby form the core of the Black Swan, the parasitic nature of the spell resulted in selecting girls who possessed a strong resemblance to either Stella or her baby. Strauss discovered the true nature of the Black Swan shortly after the death of the first Black Swan and though initially enraged that her spirit and their child's had been used in such a manner, he and Stella managed to communicate over the years in hopes of ending Strauss's pain, as well saving the dhamphirs and the hosts of the Black Swan. She is revealed to be an adopted daughter of Maria Saverhagen. : An enemy of Strauss during the time of the Kingdom of the Night, known as \\"Infinite Cross Saberhagen\\" and is the only human Bridget ever considered to be near Strauss' level of skill. Saberhagen saw Strauss as the Red Rose of Disaster and sought to defeat him no matter what tricks she had to resort to. She eventually created the curse of the Black Swan and led an alliance of countries against the Kingdom of the Night, demanding Strauss' execution. Saberhagen was also responsible for creating the spell to seal away Adelheid when she went berserk and unleashed the Moonlight of Corrosion. Despite caring deeply for the children she adopted as wards, including Stella, her ruthless pragmatism caused her to do various despicable acts, such as kill Stella as a sacrifice to defeat Strauss. Before her death, after her last encounter with Strauss, Saverhagen was the first person to listen to Strauss's reasons to become the common enemy of both humans and his own kind where he was able to prevent an endless war with the two sides.

Georgia, for example, tests from the ninth to twelfth grades, and North Carolina tests for any of the four core class subjects (math, science, social studies, and English). North Carolina schools administer an EOCT in English II, Math I (Algebra I), and Biology. The official purpose of the test is to assess both individual and group knowledge and skills. EOCTs are mandatory and require a minimum score for graduation eligibility. Additionally, a North Carolina student's EOCT score must account for at least 25% of the student's final grade in the relevant course. Georgia high schools are required to administer a standardized, multiple-choice EOCT, in each of eight core subjects including Algebra I, Geometry, U.S. History, Economics, Biology, Physical Science, Ninth Grade Literature and Composition, and American Literature and Composition. The official purpose of the tests is to assess \\"specific content knowledge and skills.\\" Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive credit in the course or to graduate from high school, completion of the test is mandatory. The EOCT score comprises 20% of a student's grade in the course. Since the EOCT is an official, state-administered test, any violation or interference can result in the invalidation of scores of all students taking the exam on that subject. Interferences can include cellphones, mp3 players, reading books on the same subject as the exam, and talking. Also, E.O.C tests can be taken in middle schools. For example, in the state of Florida it is mandatory for 7th graders (Middle school) to take a Civics EOC Test. A student can pass only if he attains a level of 3, 4 or 5.

Mitochondrial carriers are also classified in the Transporter Classification Database. The Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) Superfamily has been expanded to include both the original Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) family (TC# 2.A.29) and the Mitochondrial Inner/Outer Membrane Fusion (MMF) family (TC# 9.B.25).  Phylogeny  Members of the MC family (TC# 2.A.29) are found exclusively in eukaryotic organelles although they are nuclearly encoded. Most are found in mitochondria, but some are found in peroxisomes of animals, in hydrogenosomes of anaerobic fungi, and in amyloplasts of plants. 15 paralogues of the MC family are encoded within the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 50 have been identified in humans, 58 in A. thaliana and 35 in S. cerevisiae. The functions of many of the human homologues are unknown, but most of the yeast homologues have been functionally identified. See TCDB for functional assignments  Function  Many MC proteins preferentially catalyze the exchange of one solute for another (antiport). A variety of these substrate carrier proteins, which are involved in energy transfer, have been found in the inner membranes of mitochondria and other eukaryotic organelles such as the peroxisome and facilitate the transport of inorganic ions, nucleotides, amino acids, keto acids and cofactors across the membrane. Such proteins include: * ADP/ATP carrier protein (ADP-ATP translocase; i.e., TC# 2.A.29.1.2) * 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein (SLC25A11; TC# 2.A.29.2.11) * phosphate carrier protein (SLC25A3; TC# 2.A.29.4.2) * Tricarboxylate transport protein (SLC25A1, or citrate transport protein; TC# 2.A.29.7.2) * Graves disease carrier protein (SLC25A16; TC# 2.A.29.12.1) * Yeast mitochondrial proteins MRS3 (TC# 2.A.29.5.1) and MRS4 (TC# 2.A.29.5.2) * Yeast mitochondrial FAD carrier protein (TC# 2.A.29.10.1) * As well as many others. Functional aspects of these proteins, including metabolite transport, have been reviewed by Dr. Ferdinando Palmieri and Dr. Ciro Leonardo Pierri (2010). Diseases caused by defects of mitochondrial carriers are reviewed by Palmieri et al. (2008) and by Guti√©rrez-Aguilar and Baines 2013. Mutations of mitochondrial carrier genes involved in mitochondrial functions other than oxidative phosphorylation are responsible for carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier deficiency, HHH syndrome, aspartate/glutamate isoform 2 deficiency, Amish microcephaly, and neonatal myoclonic epilepsy. These disorders are characterized by specific metabolic dysfunctions, depending on the physiological role of the affected carrier in intermediary metabolism. Defects of mitochondrial carriers that supply mitochondria with the substrates of oxidative phosphorylation, inorganic phosphate and ADP, are responsible for diseases characterized by defective energy production. Residues involved in substrate binding in the middle of the transporter and gating have been identified and analyzed.  Structure  Permeases of the MC family (the human SLC25 family) possess six transmembrane Œ±-helices. The proteins are of fairly uniform size of about 300 residues. They arose by tandem intragenic triplication in which a genetic element encoding two spanners gave rise to one encoding six spanners. This event may have occurred less than 2 billion years ago when mitochondria first developed their specialized endosymbiotic functions within eukaryotic cells. Members of the MC family are functional and structural monomers although early reports indicated that they are dimers. Most MC proteins contain a primary structure exhibiting three repeats, each of about 100 amino acid residues in length, and both the N and C termini face the intermembrane space. All carriers contain a common sequence, referred to as the MCF motif, in each repeated region, with some variation in one or two signature sequences. Amongst the members of the mitochondrial carrier family that have been identified, it is the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC; TC# 2.A.29.1.1) that is responsible for importing ADP into the mitochondria and exporting ATP out of the mitochondria and into the cytosol following synthesis. The AAC is an integral membrane protein that is synthesised lacking a cleavable presequence, but instead contains internal targeting information. It consists of a basket shaped structure with six transmembrane helices that are tilted with respect to the membrane, 3 of them \\"kinked\\" due to the presence of prolyl residues. Residues that are important for the transport mechanism are likely to be symmetrical, whereas residues involved in substrate binding will be asymmetrical reflecting the asymmetry of the substrates. By scoring the symmetry of residues in the sequence repeats, Robinson et al. (2008) identified the substrate-binding sites and salt bridge networks that are important for transport. The symmetry analyses provides an assessment of the role of residues and provides clues to the chemical identities of substrates of uncharacterized transporters. There are structures of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in two different states. One is the cytoplasmic state, inhibited by carboxyatractyloside, in which the substrate binding site is accessible to the intermembrane space, which is confluent with the cytosol, i.e. the bovine mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier /, the yeast ADP/ATP carrier Aac2p /, the yeast ADP/ATP carrier Aac3p /, Another is the matrix state, inhibited by bongkrekic acid, in which the substrate binding site is accessible to the mitochondrial matrix, i.e. the fungal mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier . In addition, there are structures of the calcium regulatory domains of the mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier in the calcium-bound state / and mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers in different regulatory states //.  Substrates  Mitochondrial carriers transport amino acids, keto acids, nucleotides, inorganic ions and co-factors through the mitochondrial inner membrane. The transporters consist of six transmembrane alpha-helices with threefold pseudo-symmetry. The transported substrates of MC family members may bind to the bottom of the cavity, and translocation results in a transient transition from a 'pit' to a 'channel' conformation. An inhibitor of AAC, carboxyatractyloside, probably binds where ADP binds, in the pit on the outer surface, thus blocking the transport cycle. Another inhibitor, bongkrekic acid, is believed to stabilize a second conformation, with the pit facing the matrix. In this conformation, the inhibitor may bind to the ATP-binding site. Functional and structural roles for residues in the TMSs have been proposed. The mitochondrial carrier signature, Px[D/E]xx[K/R], of carriers is probably involved both in the biogenesis and in the transport activity of these proteins. A homologue has been identified in the mimivirus genome and shown to be a transporter for dATP and dTTP.

Originally laid down as LST-513; reclassified ARL-9 on 3 November 1943; launched on 17 December; sponsored by Mrs. Mary C. Hanley; and commissioned on 9 May 1944 with Lieutenant A. Edgell in command. Service history After a brief shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay she sailed for Guantanamo Bay, joined a convoy headed toward the Panama Canal, and proceeded independently to San Diego. Continuing to Pearl Harbor she deployed with TG 32.6 to Guadalcanal where she arrived on 26 August 1944. She effected repairs here and at the Russell Islands before joining a task group preparing for the invasion of the Palau Islands where she carried on her vital work. From 3 October to 25 February 1945 she was active at Kossol Passage. On the latter date she sailed in convoy to Leyte where she remained for a month in the performance of diving operations and repairing of landing craft. She next proceeded with Task Unit 51.14.3 for the invasion of Okinawa and rendered invaluable service to battle- and weather-damaged destroyers, landing craft and patrol vessels. On 28 April 1945 she suffered damage from a shrapnel burst which wounded 15 of her crew. On 10 May 1945 she changed her anchorage to Buckner Bay where she underwent frequent suicide plane attacks, but continued uninterrupted her repair service. The Endymion got underway with Task Unit 31.29.29 for Saipan on 7 June 1945. She then left Saipan for Pearl Harbor without benefit of protective escort‚Äîwhich was unusual, given the great potential for risk to the ship and its crew. On 21 June she was torpedoed. At least two torpedoes passed beneath the ship, but a third detonated directly under the fantail, causing damage to her steering gear and resulting in 11 [reported] wounded. The submarine then surfaced, but before its crew could man and operate its deck guns, one of the Endymion's gunners (Gunner's Mate First Class Alfred \\"Al\\" Lamay) directed continuous fire at the submarine's conning tower with one of the ship's twin 20mm anti- aircraft cannons (likely the Oerlikon 20mm/85 KAA). This heroic action is credited as having saved the lives of the Endymion's crew, because common practice was for Japanese naval commanders to sink damaged ships and leave no survivors. Cannon fire from the twin 20mm guns is thought to have severely damaged and possibly penetrated the conning tower, forcing the Japanese submarine to submerge and run. However, the Endymion sat immobile for two to three days, during which time crew reported seeing a US Navy sea plane (Martin PBM-5 Mariner) approach, circle, turn around, and fly off. A submarine chaser was dispatched to bring her in to Eniwetok Harbor where temporary repairs were made. She continued to Pearl Harbor where she readied herself for return to take part in the invasion of Japan, but the war ended and the Endymion headed back to the United States. Endymion began a period of overhaul at Astoria, Oregon on 9 November 1945. She was decommissioned on 30 November 1946 and was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1972, she was sold for commercial service 1 September 1973. Registered to Petrola Hellas S.A. of Panama in 1974 and renamed Petrola XVIII, she was restyled as Petrola 18 in September, 1976. Sold in 1978 to the Thetis Shipping & Trading Corporation S.A. of Panama, then resold (date unknown) to Sete Technical Services S.A. of Panama and renamed Sete 50, her final fate is unknown.

They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a work piece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa. Types Thread inserts come in many varieties, depending on the application. Threaded inserts for plastics are used in plastic materials and applied with thermal insertion or ultrasonic welding machines. Manufacturers of ready-to-assemble furniture often ship the parts with threaded inserts and other kinds of knock-down fasteners pre-installed. People who use sheet metal or sandwich panel or honeycomb sandwich-structured composite often install threaded inserts to spread shear, tension, and torque loads over a larger area of the material. Captive nut Captive nuts come in two basic styles. One type, the cage nut or clip-on nut is a conventional nut held captive by a sheet metal carrier that clips onto the part to be connected. These are generally used to attach screws to sheet metal parts too thin to be threaded, and they can generally be attached, removed and reused with simple hand tools. The second type of captive nut is a threaded insert. These are either pressed into holes in the material to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled to get a good grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.McMaster-Carr, p. 3150. Threaded inserts are commonly used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws to be used in the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the threaded insert into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the threaded insert to ensure a good retention.  Externally-threaded inserts  A self-tapping insert Externally threaded inserts have threads on the outside and inside of the insert. The insert is threaded into a pre-tapped hole, or some inserts tap their own threads in a drilled or molded hole. It is then anchored by various means, such as a nylon locking element. Inserts that are anchored via Loctite are more commonly known by the trademarked name E-Z Lok. A thin walled solid bushing insert by the trademarked name TIME-SERT is locked in by rolling the bottom few internal thread into the base material with a special install driver which will permanently lock the insert in place. Key locking inserts, more commonly known by the trademarked name Keenserts, use keys that are hammered into grooves through the threads, permanently locking the insert.McMaster-Carr, p. 3204.McMaster-Carr, p. 3206.McMaster-Carr, p. 3207. Inserts that are self-tapping and lock via friction are more commonly known by the trademarked names Tap-lok or Speedserts. Helical insert A helical insert A helical insert is an insert made of coiled wire. The helically formed coils of diamond shaped stainless steel or phosphor bronze wire screw into a threaded hole to form a mating internal thread for a screw or stud. These inserts provide a convenient means of repairing stripped-out threads and are also used to provide stronger threads in soft materials such as aluminium, zinc die castings, wood, magnesium etc. than can be obtained by direct tapping of the base metal involved. Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users call them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include engine cylinder head repair after unintentional over-torquing or cross-threading of spark plugs strips the thread of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this. The straight radial piece in the photo is the driver tang which is used as a key to grip with pliers for driving the coil into place and is discarded after installation. Mold-in inserts Mold-in inserts are internally threaded and have a specially shaped outer diameter to anchor the insert in plastic. The insert is placed in the mold of an injection molded part beforehand. The mold is then closed and filled with the plastic filling in around the insert. These inserts can also be heated and pressed into pre-made thermoplastics.McMaster-Carr, p. 3209. For softer more pliable plastics, hexagonal or square inserts with deep and wide grooves allow the plastic to flow and adhere. The process allows large product manufacture i.e. fuel tanks, boats etc., so the torque inserts may be of large thread sizes. Press fit inserts Press fit inserts are internally threaded and have a knurled outer diameter. They are pressed into a plain hole with an arbor press. Potted Inserts An insert that is potted-in refers to the application of epoxy to fix it to a panel, such as a honeycomb sandwich panel, which are often used in commercial aircraft.

Or, a contraction of ecological genetics, the study of the relationship between a natural population and its genetic structure. Ecogenetics principally deals with effects of preexisting genetically-determined variability on the response to environmental agents. The word environmental is defined broadly to include the physical, chemical, biological, atmospheric, and climate agents. Ecogenetics, therefore, is an all-embracing term, and concepts such as pharmacogenetics are seen as subcomponents of ecogenetics. This work grew logically from the book entitled Pollutants and High Risk Groups (1978), which presented an overview of the various host factors i.e. age, heredity, diet, preexisting diseases, and lifestyles which affect environmentally-induced disease. The primary intention of ecogenetics is to provide an objective and critical evaluation of the scientific literature pertaining to genetic factors and differential susceptibility to environmental agents, with particular emphasis on those agents typically considered pollutants. It is important to realize though that ones genetic makeup, while important, is but one of an array of host factors contributing to overall adaptive capacity of the individual. In many instances, it is possible for such factors to interact in ways that may enhance or offset the effect of each other. Red blood cell conditions There is a broad group of genetic diseases that result in either producing or predisposing affected individuals to the development of hemolytic anemias. These diseases include abnormal hemoglobin, inability to manufacture one or the other of the peptide globin chains of the hemoglobin, and deficiencies of the Embden-Meyerhoff monophosphate. Liver metabolism Individuals lacking the ability to detoxify and excrete PCB's may have a high risk of total liver failure in conjunction with certain ecological conditions. Cardiovascular diseases The pathologic lesion of atherosclerosis is a plaque-like substance that thickens the innermost and middle of the three layers of the artery wall. The thickening of the intimal and medial layers results from the accumulation of the proliferating smooth muscle cells that are encompassed by interstitial substances such as collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and fibrin. Respiratory diseases There are three genetically-based respiratory diseases that can directly correspond with ecological functions and induce disease. These include lung cancer and the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with a serum Ig A deficiency.

Her songs have been recorded by Cher, Bette Midler, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Cole, Robert Cray, David Crosby, Adam Ant and Booker T and the MGs. Early life and education Hayes is the eldest of seven children and she attended Washington High School and San Francisco State University. Her brother, Chris, was the lead guitarist for Huey Lewis and the News, and another brother, Kevin, the drummer with the Robert Cray Band. Her family moved to San Francisco from the San Joaquin Valley in 1970 and Hayes joined the jazz fusion band Sweetmeat and taught piano and music theory at the Blue Bear School of Music. Career In the early 1980s, Hayes founded the new wave band The Punts, and released the single, \\"Shelly's Boyfriend\\". In 1982, the band was signed by Slash Records and changed the name to \\"Bonnie Hayes with the Wild Combo\\". A song from the album Good Clean Fun called \\"Girls Like Me\\" appeared in the 1983 movie Valley Girl. Her album, Brave New Girl was released on Bondage Records. Hayes and her band toured as the opening act for Huey Lewis and the News. After being signed by Huey Lewis and the News's publishing company, Hayes signed with Chrysalis Records and in 1987 released the album Bonnie Hayes. \\"Some Guys\\", the first single from the record, was recorded by Cher. In 1988, Hayes signed with Muscle Records and Miles Copeland. She recorded an album that was never released. Later that year, she became a member of Belinda Carlisle's band for her world tour. In 1989, Bonnie Raitt recorded Hayes' songs, \\"Love Letter\\" and \\"Have a Heart\\", for her Nick of Time album. The Hayes \\"Have a Heart\\" song was the top charting song on the album, rising to number 3 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In 1991, Hayes joined Billy Idol on tour for almost two years in support of his record Cradle of Love. In 1996, Hayes was signed to Fuel records and recorded the album Empty Sky. One song from the album, \\"Bottomless\\", was later recorded by Bette Midler. In 2004, Hayes released the CD \\"Love in the Ruins\\", written after she had learned to play the guitar. The record shows the strong songwriting for which she is known and a capricious rough-edged quality evocative of her first record with a rootsier, Americana sound. She has taught at the Berklee College of Music, the Stanford Jazz Workshop, the REO Songwriting Retreat outside of Vancouver B.C, the ASCAP workshops in Los Angeles and at the WCS Conference at Foothill College. In 2013, Hayes became chair of the songwriting department at Berklee in Boston.

The new Paramount label reissued pop releases by sister label Dot Records, which became a country label. It also released new albums from other pop musicians and soundtracks to Paramount films such as Paint Your Wagon, among others. Cast members of the Paramount Television series The Brady Bunch were signed, and the label issued several tie-in albums and singles. After Gulf+Western sold its record label holdings to ABC (which happened to have aired the Brady Bunch TV series) in 1974, the Paramount label was discontinued in favor of ABC Records, which itself was sold to MCA Records in 1979. The Paramount catalog is now owned by Universal Music Group and managed by Geffen Records (whose founder, David Geffen, later became a co-founder of DreamWorks, which was a sister studio to Paramount from 2006‚Äì8, and whose own record catalog is now owned by Universal). On a side note, MCA continued to release soundtracks to some later Paramount films into the 1990s. Sliding Doors (1998) was the last Paramount release to have its soundtrack issued by MCA. In 2015, Paramount Pictures revived the label as Paramount Music - a record label specializing in soundtracks from Paramount movies, with distribution by TuneCore.

One such oral variant is The Thief and His Master.Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 347, Synopsis In Sicily, in the town of Messina, Maestro Lattantio had learned to be both a magician and a tailor. He took an apprentice, Dionigi, to teach to be a tailor, but Dionigi spied on him and lost all interest in being a tailor because of his desire to learn magic. Lattantio sent him away, but his father sent him back, where Lattantio often punished him for his laziness, but Dionigi bore it because he could watch Lattantio secretly and learn his magic. One day, his father found him doing housework rather than learning to be a tailor, and brought him home, grieved that after his money was spent, his son had not learned a trade. Dionigi turned himself into a horse, and had his father display him for sale. Lattantio saw it and realized that it was Dionigi. He changed himself into a merchant and bought the horse. The father would not sell the bridle, but Lattantio increased his price until the father agreed. Lattantio then took the horse home and mistreated it. His two daughters pitied the horse and were kind to it. One day, they took it down to the stream to drink, where it dashed into the water and became a little fish. Lattantio, finding the horse gone, got his daughters to tell him what had happened, and turned himself into a tunny to chase Dionigi. Dionigi swam near the shore, and jumped into a basket carried by a handmaiden of the king's daughter, turning himself into a ruby ring. , the king's daughter, found the ring and put it on. At night, when she went to bed, he changed into his own form, prevented her from screaming, and explained his plight; she promised to help him as long as he respected her honor. She kept him as a ring by day, and at night would talk with him in human form. The king fell ill. Lattantio came and cured him, asking the princess's ring as his reward. The king summoned , with orders to bring all her jewels, but left behind the ring. Lattantio realized it was missing and said she could find it. She returned to her room and wept over the ring. Dionigi told her that the man was his enemy, and that she should bring the ring and when giving it, throw it against the wall as if in a temper. When she was finally compelled to bring the ring, she did as he had asked, and the ring became a pomegranate that, when it hit the floor, scattered seeds. Lattantio became a rooster and ate the seeds to put an end to Dionigi, but one seed hid out of his reach, and when it had a chance, turned to a fox and bit off the rooster's head. Dionigi told the king the story and with his consent married .

The company was formerly known as Diskeeper Corporation, a name derived from its flagship product, Diskeeper, a file-system defragmentation software package for Microsoft Windows and OpenVMS. Before adopting the Diskeeper name, the company was known as Executive Software International, Inc.  Products  Condusiv Technologies sells and supports a number of software products. Diskeeper, a tool for reducing file fragmentation; V-locity Virtual Machine, a platform disk optimizer for virtual server; Undelete, which offers protection from and recovery of accidentally deleted files. Condusiv sells its products to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) including SanDisk, Samsung and LG. Condusiv OEM products include ExpressCache, which exploits a small-density SSD as a cache for a larger-capacity HDD, thus improving boot times and applications launch. The company also has several technologies such as HyperFast, a solid-state drive optimizer, HyperBoot, a boot-time optimization technology; and InvisiTasking, which enables any process to run invisibly in the background. Another technology introduced by the company in 2009 is IntelliWrite, an advanced file-system driver designed to leverage Windows‚Äô file system ‚ÄúBest Fit‚Äù file-write design in order to write a file in a non- fragmented state. IntelliWrite is designed to prevent most fragmentation before it happens in Windows computer systems, allowing for better file write performance plus compatibility and interoperability with other storage management products.  Company history  Old logo It was founded in March, 1981, by Craig Jensen.CEO Craig Jensen's web site The company was initially created to serve VAX/VMS platforms. Because the product allowed companies to defragment without shutting their systems down, its original customer base was Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, air traffic control, NASA and others with mission critical systems or systems that needed to be running 24/7. In the early 1990s, Diskeeper was the best-selling third- party software product for Digital Equipment Corporation business computers. The company, then named Executive Software, placed on Software magazine‚Äôs list of the Top 100 Independent Software Companies for four years in a row (1989-1992). In 1995 the company was asked by Microsoft to develop products for its Windows NT system before it was released. One of Microsoft's original source code licensees, the company broke into the Windows market with the resulting defrag product for Windows NT.The Wall Street Transcript, Kathy Wattman Jerry Baldwin was appointed CEO in September 2011 and Craig Jensen passed his managerial and day-to-day involvement with the company on to Baldwin.Condusiv press release: Diskeeper Corporation Announces New Name Baldwin renamed the company to Condusiv Technologies and completely restructured and re-focused the company on Cloud, Virtualization and Optimization. The tagline \\"Think Faster\\" is now the company motto.  Founder  While studying electrical engineering at Northwestern University in 1968, Craig Jensen took a night job as a computer operator to learn about computers. He went on to develop advanced operating systems for early technology pioneer Applied Data Research, and in 1974 moved to Data General Corporation. He founded Executive Software International in 1981, he says, \\"with an early personal computer and a box of file folders in his kitchen in Hollywood.\\" Mr. Jensen stepped down as CEO in 2009. He is the author of The Craft of Computer Programming (New York: Warner Books, 1985) . Craig Jensen is a member of the Church of Scientology and a member of the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises (WISE), an international membership organization whose members use the management technology of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology. He has stated that his employees are schooled in Hubbard's management technology, with courses that include Effective Leadership, Executives and Ethics, Executive Basics and Management by Statistics.Prosperity Magazine, Craig Jensen  Controversy  In 1991, the company (back then Executive Software) refused to renew technical support for Ciba-Geigy‚Äôs VAX version of Diskeeper after learning that Ciba-Geigy makes Ritalin, a drug that was linked with suicide in children. Jensen told Digital News that Executive Software would honor its contractual obligations with Ciba-Geigy, which had purchased a 12-month update service. However, it would not renew the service or the software once the agreement expired. ‚ÄòCiba-Geigy slipped through,‚Äô said Jensen. ‚ÄòBut I think someone should take a stand on this, and I'm willing to do so.' In 2000, the inclusion of the functionality of the Home version of Diskeeper in Microsoft Windows 2000's Disk Defragmenter was the subject of an investigation by the German Federal Office of Security in Information Technology (BSI), which looked into whether Diskeeper poses a security threat to users by spying on users.Catholics distrust Scientology software In Germany the law bars state and federal governments from doing business with a member of the Church of Scientology, a government policy that has been criticized by the US State Department in 1999 and in a 1998 UN Report as discriminatory and government-condoned harassment. A Microsoft spokesman stated that Microsoft had extensively tested Diskeeper for security breaches and found the tool had no ability to store and transmit data on users, and there was no data transfer involved in its processes, but bowed to pressure, allowing users the option to remove it. On November 5, 2008, Diskeeper's former CIO, Alexander Godelman, and Automation Planning Officer Marc Le Shay jointly filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court for improper dismissal. In the complaint they allege that the company required training in Hubbard Management courses, which are based on the management technology of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, as a condition of employment, and that failure to comply was cause for their dismissal. The plaintiffs cited this as a violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and requested an injunction against the delivery of the courses at Diskeeper.http://realitybasedcommunity.net/archive/2008/12/former_cio_sues.php On January 27, 2009, Diskeeper filed a motion to strike the proposed injunction, citing, without conceding that Hubbard Management Technology is religious in nature, legal precedence of religious based practices in business being protected by the First Amendment. On February 18, 2009 the motion to strike was granted and the proposed injunction removed from the case. On June 24, 2009 the case was dismissed in its entirety.

It was first published in serialised form by The Sydney Mail between July 1882 and August 1883, then in three volumes in London in 1888. It was abridged into a single volume in 1889 as part of Macmillan's one-volume Colonial Library series and has not been out of print since. It is considered a classic of Australian colonial literature, alongside Marcus Clarke's convict novel For the Term of his Natural Life (1876) and Fergus Hume's mystery crime novel The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1886), and has inspired numerous adaptations in film, television and theatre.  Plot introduction  Writing in the first person, the narrator Dick Marston tells the story of his life and loves and his association with the notorious bushranger Captain Starlight, a renegade from a noble English family. Set in the bush and goldfields of Australia in the 1850s, Starlight's gang, with Dick and his brother Jim's help, sets out on a series of escapades that include cattle theft and robbery under arms.Robbery under arms, ABC Shop. Retrieved 1 May 2007  Plot summary  Patrick William Marony, Starlight's hold-up at the dance hall, 1894 The book begins with Dick sitting in gaol, with just under one month before his scheduled execution for his crimes. He is given writing material, and begins documenting his life's story. He starts with his childhood, with a father (Ben) who is prone to violence, particularly when he has been drinking; his mother, his sister (Aileen) and brother, Jim. He documents his first exposure to his father's crimes, the theft of a red calf, and the disapproval of this crime by his mother, who says she thought he had given up stealing since the theft which led to his transportation as a convict from England. Dick's first active involvement in crime, comes where the brothers choose to go cattle duffing (stealing), even though an offer of solid, honest work had been made with neighbour and friend, George Storefield. The divergent lives of the brothers to that of George is a recurring theme of the book from this point forward, as they continue to meet up at different points throughout the story's course. This first theft includes their introduction to Captain Starlight, his Aboriginal assistant, Warrigal, and their hideaway, Terrible Hollow. Further thefts follow, leading up to the brazen theft of 1000 head, driven overland to Adelaide with Starlight. After the success of this adventure, the brothers \\"lie low\\" in Melbourne, where they meet the sisters, Kate and Jeanie Morrison. The brothers return to home for Christmas, leading to incarceration and trial of Dick and Starlight. (The magistrate chooses to refer to Starlight only by this nickname, at the Captain's request). Warrigal helps Dick and Starlight escape to Terrible Hollow. The gang later has its first stage holdup. The brothers then move to the Turon goldfields. Their prosperity through honest, hard work gives them the chance for escape from the country to start a new life overseas. Jim is re-united with Jeanie Morrison and marries her. Dick meets Kate Morrison again, but her tumultuous nature leads her, in an angry mood, to alert the police to their presence, and they narrowly escape capture and return to the safety of Terrible Hollow. Charles E. Hammond, Starlight and his gang sticking up the Turon Gold Escort, c. 1898 Seeing no alternative to crime, the gang joins forces with a soon- to- be rival Dan Moran and his friends to stage a major hold up of the armed, escorted stagecoach leaving the goldfields. The robbery is a success, with the members splitting up after sharing the gold takings. Starlight's crew hears word of Moran's planned home invasion of a police informant named Mr Whitman, at a time when Mr Whitman was known to be absent. Marston and Starlight intervene, forcing Moran and his men to leave, thus preventing further harm to the women present and the home being burnt down at the end of the night. At the height of their infamy, the gang attend the Turon horse race, where Starlight's horse, Rainbow, wins. The same weekend, they attend the wedding of a publican's daughter, Bella Barnes, where Starlight fulfils his earlier promise to dance, unrecognised, with her at her wedding, despite the presence of the entire town, including the goldfields commissioner and other dignitaries. Ben Marston is later ambushed and wounded by bounty hunters. Moran, nearby, releases him, and shoots all four bounty hunters in cold blood, again highlighting the different honour codes between the two gangs. Ben returns to Terrible Hollow, and is nursed by his daughter, Aileen. Aileen and Starlight begin a relationship, and arrange to marry. Despite the animosity between the rivals, they team up again to rob the home of the Goldfield Commissioner, Mr Knightley, but are met with more resistance than they expected. One of Moran's associates is shot in the skirmish, and Moran is keen to kill Knightley when they later have him face to face. Starlight turns the tables by giving Mr Knightley one of his own pistols. He them proceeds to arrange for Knightley's wife to go to Bathurst and withdraw some cash, and meet Moran's men by \\"the Black Stump\\", outside of Bathurst town. Starlight passes the time gambling with Mr Knightley, sharing his food, drink and company. Starlight loses money in the gambling, and arranges to repay by direct payment into his account, as well as paying for the horse he is offered when leaving. Patrick William Marony, Death of Captain Starlight with his head in Warrigal's lap, 1894 Throughout the book, there have been chance meetings with Dick's childhood friend and neighbour, George Storefield who, in contrast with the Marston boys, works hard, keeps within the law and thrives financially. Dick starts to hold up George, now a successful grazier, businessman, magistrate and landholder, before realising who it was. George offers the brothers safe haven and cattle mustering work, which would allow Dick, Starlight and Jim safer travel to Townsville in Queensland, from where they plan to leave to San Francisco. They accept the offer, but are caught, partially due to betrayal by Warrigal and Kate Morrison along the way, and Starlight and Jim are shot dead. Dick is wounded and brought to trial, bringing the story to where it began, with Dick expecting to be hanged shortly. In a surprise ending, Dick's sentence is reduced to fifteen years imprisonment due to petitions from Storefield, Knightley and other prominent people. He serves twelve years, is visited occasionally by Gracey Storefield, whom he marries shortly after his release, before moving to a remote area of Queensland to manage a station for her brother, George Storefield.

Allusions/references from other works  The early film adaptations of the book are referenced in the title of Kathryn Heyman's 2006 novel, Captain Starlight's Apprentice.  Major themes  The book, written in first person narrative, contains repeated regrets for the narrator's crimes, highlighting how seemingly minor crimes led to an inescapable life of further crimes. These are contrasted with the success of Dick's hardworking childhood friend, who becomes a successful landowner, merchant and magistrate. The themes of honour and loyalty are repeated throughout the story, which eventually leads to Dick's redemption from hanging and, having served his time in gaol, a presumed peaceful, safe and legal life. As a ripping yarn, originally told in periodical installments, the story mostly centres around the lovable villains, who are adventurers and thieves but nevertheless with high moral standards and, in some ways, trapped by circumstances of their own making.  Literary significance and criticism  English author Thomas Wood called the novel \\"a classic, which for life and dash and zip and colour ‚Äî all of a period ‚Äî has no match in all Australian letters.\\"Browne, Thomas Alexander, Australian Dictionary of Biography Online.

Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science  In his December 1888 Preface to the New Edition, Browne wrote: > \\"...though presented in the guise of fiction, this chronicle of the Marston > family must not be set down by the reader as wholly fanciful or exaggerated. > Much of the narrative is literally true, as can be verified by official > records.\\"Preface to the 1889 edition. Although bushranger Frank Pearson claimed Captain Starlight was based on him, Boldrewood claims his character was a composite, based in part on Harry Redford but primarily on Thomas Smith, known as Captain Midnight. The cattle robbery follows the lifting of about a thousand head by Redford from Bowen Downs Station in 1870. Some of the exploits recounted are based on actual incidents involving bushrangers Daniel Morgan, Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert, although not all factual events which contributed to the novel took place during the period in which the novel is set. Terrible Hollow, the gang's bush hideaway, is drawn from a sunken valley reported in the Gwydir district.

History of site This sod home was used by James Addison and his family north of Kindersley, Saskatchewan, Canada and east on Highway 21. His property held a barn, two sheds, shelterbelt as well as dugout. Sod houses were a popular construction choice in the early 1900s by the early homesteaders to Saskatchewan and were similar to an earth sheltering type of house. Whereas many earth sheltering houses were built into hills, a 'soddie' had the base dug down about below the residence square footage area. A layer of buffalo, oxen or cattle chips which was then covered over with a well packed layer of clay. The walls were made of pieces of sod approximately deep, wide, and 4 to long. These sod pieces were laid in overlapping fashion to construct all four walls. These walls would provide shelter in its enclosed space from precipitation, wind, heat, and the cold of 40 degree below winters, and insulation against the heat of 40 degree above summers. The roofs were generally made of aspen logs laid across the walls, and these logs covered in sod. Heavy spring rains were the main downfall of these homes as the sod on the roof, dried out from winter, and only supported with the logs would wash away with the water. Most homesteaders used the sod house as a temporary house until a wooden or brick structure was built. This particular sod house had several unique features which has helped it to survive until this day, nearly a century after first construction. The sod chosen were from a dried up waterlogged area or a dried up slough so the grass roots were quite thick. Sods are usually overlapped when made into walls, however, Addison made a hole in the center of each sod piece so that as the piece of sod dried it would tend to crumble in on itself, rather than outwards. He also made each wall triangular, so that the width of the wall at the base was wider than the top. The roofs which were the downfall of most sod houses was not typical on Addison's Sod house. He departed from using sod for the roof, but made a wooden hip roof with wood shingles eliminating water damage from spring rains, and winter snow melting. Addison also protected his sod walls from the elements, first by growing vines, then by covering the exterior with cedar shingles. With the advent new technologies in home construction, the cedar shingles were replaced with asphalt, then with vinyl siding. James Addison and his descendants have continuously occupied the house since its construction. The family received an award for long term stewardship of a heritage property from Saskatchewan's lieutenant governor in 2017.

Known for their violence onstage and unique vocals provided by a lineup that sometimes included two main vocalists (Prater and Schmidt both being solo vocals for the band at one time through the band's career.) and a trio of guitarists (Fogelbach and Emerick also surviving the lifetime of the band). The group has performed many tours across the United States and has performed with the likes of Converge and Godflesh. Since their break-up in 2003, the group has performed one-off reunion shows two times. Biography The group formed in 1997 in St. Peters, Missouri by vocalists Mike Shmitz and Nathan Prater, bassist Chris Grady, drummer Matt Prater, and guitarists Jason Emerick and Scott Fogelbach. The group would proceed to record two demos. The first was released in 1998, the second, titled Unfound, was released in 1999. That same year the group released a split 7\\" with Joshua Fit For Battle through Normal Records. Eventually, the group gained A.J. Doerhoff, their third guitarist, and were signed by Happy Couples Never Last. Their debut self-titled album was released in June 2000, garnering praise from the underground punk scene for its style. The group toured with the likes of Pg. 99, and by 2002, they released a third demo as well as their second full-length, Upon the Right, I Saw a New Misery. Both Schmitz and Doerhoff left the group before production of the album began. While both of these albums are now out-of-print, they were eventually reissued on digital formats through Robotic Empire's Archivist imprint. By August 2002, Matt Prater left the group. To fill in his place, the group hired drummers for short periods at a time. By April 2003, the group went on a hiatus. This was due to the fact that Scott Fogelbach's father was, at the time, recently diagnosed with cancer. It was not until October of that same year when the group officially broke up. Their last show was performed in July 2003. Since their break-up, Grady and Fogelbach went on to perform in For The Last Time. Fogelbach also joined One Cycle Occur. Nathan Pater would go on to join Unholy Effers. Reunions Since their break-up in 2003, the group has reunited three times to play one-off shows. Their first reunion happened on January 15, 2005 at the Creepy Crawl, after first being announced back in December 2004. The line-up included Fogelbach, Grady, Emerick, and Nathan and Mike Prater. This line-up reunited again to perform a show in July 2008 at the Fubar, a venue in St. Louis, Missouri operated by a friend of the band. The band would perform again at the Fubar for a benefit show on October 1, 2010.

Jacob Bruno Ernst Jacob (September 9, 1899 ‚Äì January 5, 1979) was a professor at Ripon College in Wisconsin and founder of the National Forensic League. He served as the league's executive secretary from 1925 until his retirement in 1969.  Biography  Jacob was born in Valders, Wisconsin, the youngest of four boys. He graduated from Manitowoc High School in 1918 and earned a B.A. in economics from Ripon College in 1922. He was a founding member of Phi Kappa Pi, a local fraternity at Ripon College. After graduation, he taught social studies at Ripon College and coached debate at Chippewa Falls High School. Later, he taught as an assistant professor of speech at Ripon College. As a college student, Jacob compiled a vest-pocket handbook entitled Suggestions for the Debater, which achieved national circulation. This handbook led indirectly to the founding of the National Forensic League in 1925.  National Forensic League  From 1925, the National Forensic League became the dominant interest in Jacob's life. In the early years, his concern was to keep the League alive, but by 1969, when he retired, the concern had become that of trying to hold the number of chapters down to 1200 and at the same time adequately serve the affiliated schools. Because of the demands of the league activities, Jacob resigned his teaching position at Ripon College in 1950 in order to devote himself full-time to the League, visiting about 45 states a year. In 1953 the volume of work created by the expansion of the League required the addition of another full-time staff member and a third member was added a few years later. Prior to these additions, Jacob had managed the entire business of running this national organization with nothing more than part-time office help from students at Ripon College and some volunteer help from members of his family. Upon his retirement in 1969, the League presented him with a new automobile and a trip around the world. In 1978, Jacob named the first eleven members of the National Forensic League Hall of Fame. At this same event, the league inducted Jacob by acclamation. The Bruno E. Jacob Award is given at the close of each National Forensic League tournament to the participating school that has accumulated the largest number of tournament points throughout the school year.  Lifelong traveler  During his years as executive secretary, Jacob typically traveled about 20,000 miles a year, mostly by car since he enjoyed driving. Most of this was before the days of interstate highways, and even when they became available he normally would avoid the interstates in favor of the more scenic state highways and back roads. Beginning in 1946, Jacob decided to visit every county seat in every state, and to document his accomplishment he mailed himself a postcard from each one. It took him almost 25 years, but by 1970 he had been to all 3,100 counties and collected a postcard from each one complete with a postmark noting when he visited. When asked why anyone would attempt such a project, he replied, \\"I love to travel, but it's no fun without a destination.\\" Over the years he drove well over 1,000,000 miles. In just the first six years of his retirement, he put almost 300,000 miles on the car he had been given as a retirement gift. In addition to traveling around the United States, his journeys took him to the western European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Africa.

Dynasty General) is a turn-based computer wargame developed by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI). It was released in September 1998 in North America and Europe. The game focuses on early 21st century warfare in Asia. People's General, or PeG as it is commonly known, followed SSI's successful 5 Star General Series of World War II war games (Panzer General, Allied General, Pacific General) and their sequel, Panzer General II (PG2). It uses the same game dynamics as these earlier games‚Äîturn-based movement & fighting with military units on a hex based map. PeG uses substantially the same \\"Living Battlefield\\" game engine as PG2 but features higher quality (16 bit) graphics and many new features. Gameplay  People's General focuses on modern conflict in Asia between 20 countries, principally the United States, China and Russia. The countries are organized into an Eastern Alliance and a Western Alliance. China, Mongolia and North Korea comprise the Eastern Alliance. The USA, Russia, 13 other countries and the United Nations comprise the Western Alliance. Vietnam is included as a non- aligned country. The original campaigns and scenarios expanded on this premise with a more detailed background story provided by SSI via an introductory video. The video narrated hypothetical \\"future\\" events occurring from 2000‚Äì2004, i.e., after publication of the game and before the start of the campaigns and scenarios. According to this video, both the US and Russia reduce their military spendings. Russia is in turmoil from food shortages and other internal conflicts. China grows stronger militarily. After invading and annexing Taiwan it initiates a plan to dominate all of Asia from Sakhalin Islands and Vladivostok in the east to Volgograd and Kazakhstan in the west; from Siberia in the north to Southeast Asia and Singapore in the south. China justifies this as \\"reclaiming traditional Chinese territories\\". The USA sends its 7th Fleet to the Taiwan Straits to force China to withdraw. Chinese air attacks sink 7th Fleet's flagship USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), claiming it was in Chinese waters. United States denounces this as an unprovoked attack and declares war on China. The US is joined by the United Nations and most of its members. The game dynamics in PeG are essentially the same as those in PG2 and SSI's earlier Generals games: #The playing pieces are military units which have varied attack, defense and other characteristics. #Play is turn based with unit purchase, deployment, movement and combat occurring throughout each player's turn. #Game play takes place on maps with different types of terrain which affect each unit's attack, defense, movement, supply, spotting results & entrenchment. #Units can be damaged or destroyed from combat but can also increase their experience as a result of combat. #Prestige points are used to purchase or upgrade units; prestige points are distributed at the beginning of scenarios and during game play. Nine campaigns were included in the original release of PeG. Most of these are based on the idea that China grows increasingly powerful, runs low on resources and sets out to conquer Asia. The Western Alliance led by the USA hopes to stop China but the conflict becomes World War III covering all of Asia plus Russia. The original campaigns are: *Eastern Long Campaign (18 scenarios): The player takes command of the Chinese forces in their invasion of Russia and later South East Asia. *Western Long Campaign (18 scenarios): The player leads US & allied forces against the Chinese to drive them out of Russia, South East Asia and Korea. *Railroaded (6 scenarios): The player takes command of the UN forces in Russia along the Trans-Siberian Railway. *New World Order (4 scenarios): The player takes command of the Vietnamese forces in their invasion of Thailand and the Malay Peninsula. *Korea Revisited (3 scenarios): The player takes command of the US forces in the battle for the Korean peninsula. *four additional campaigns which vary the length and difficulty of the Eastern & Western campaigns. In addition to the scenarios that are part of the campaigns, PeG was released with 103 stand-alone scenarios. These can be played against the AI, against other human players using a hot-seat, via e-mail, via the Internet or LAN. The game includes an editor for users to develop their own campaigns and scenarios. Reception People's General was named the best wargame of 1998 by CNET Gamecenter, whose editors highlighted its \\"relevant subject matter, its ease of use, and its fun and enjoyable gameplay.\\" PC Gamer US and GameSpot both nominated the game in this category, but it lost the awards to The Operational Art of War I: 1939-1955. The editors of PC Gamer wrote, \\"The People's Generals great graphics, slick-as-paint interface, and new aerial sub-routine all added up to jolly, bloody fun.\\"  References  External links  * Category:1998 video games Category:Computer wargames Category:Multiplayer hotseat games Category:Play-by-email video games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Kevin Manthei Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"People's General"},{"id":"10903536","text":"Priscilla J.

The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt is an American fighter aircraft. From the first prototype produced in 1941, 15,686 P-47s were produced, the last of which was accepted by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) from Republic Aviation' Evansville, Indiana factory. Background While the majority of the earlier versions and war-weary aircraft were quickly scrapped, most of the last production blocks would continue in service with the post-war USAAF and the new USAF. For the next five years, these aircraft would continue as a front-line fighter with the active United States Air Force. It would also serve for over 10 years with a preponderance of the Air National Guard fighter units east of the Mississippi River. The P-47 would also be the foundation stock for rebuilding a majority of the post-war European air forces. Unlike the P-51, this aircraft was easily maintained and more forgiving of pilot mistakes (due to its more robust construction). Like the USAF, these aircraft only started to retire as the second generation jets became readily available. In the early 1950s as the now renamed F-47 was being retired from active USAF service, these aircraft were through various Military Assistance Programs (MAPS) offered to numerous South American countries. For the next 15 years, the F-47 would continue as a front line fighter with these nations. Unlike many of its contemporary World War II fighters, the P-47 was not a sought after aircraft on the postwar civilian marketplace. It did not have the sleek lines needed for an executive aircraft or racing. For the next 22 years, except for two razorback versions, the P-47 would progressively diminish from U.S skies. It was only in 1968 with the retirement of the Peruvian Air Force's P-47s and the successful importation of six aircraft would the population of these aircraft begin to grow. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, more airframes would be returned from numerous South American countries for restoration and display. In the late 1980s, aircraft from Yugoslavia were also rediscovered and imported. The current batches of P-47s to return to the restored are those from long forgotten wartime crash sites.

It is typically filled with pork and gelatin that melts into soup/liquid when cooked. It has been one of the most common breakfast items in Shanghai since the early 1900s. As a ubiquitous breakfast item, it has a significant place in Shanghai cuisine. Naming In Modern Chinese, a filled bun is usually called baozi or bao, while an unfilled (plain) bun is usually called a mantou. However, in the Jiangnan region where Wu Chinese is spoken, the word mantou refers to both filled and unfilled buns, as in Middle Chinese. Hence, the shengjian mantou is called a mantou despite being a filled bun. The same is true of the xiaolong mantou, which is often called xiaolongbao in the other varieties of Chinese. Ingredients Shengjian is made from semi-leavened dough, wrapped around pork and gelatin fillings. Chopped green onions and sesame are placed atop the buns during the cooking process. The name of the bun comes from its method of cooking. The buns are lined up in an oiled, shallow, flat pan. Typical commercial pans are more than a metre in diameter. The buns are lined up in the pan with the \\"knot\\", where the dough is folded together, facing downwards and thus in direct contact with the oiled pan and fried into a crispy bottom during the cooking process. Water is sprayed on the buns during cooking to ensure the top (which is not in contact with the pan or the oil) is properly cooked. After frying, the bottom of the bun becomes crunchy, and the gelatin melts into soup. This combination gives the shengjian its unique flavour. Because the buns are tightly lined up in the pan, they become somewhat cube-shaped after cooking. While waiting to be served, the chef may flip the buns so that the fried base faces upwards to prevent the crispy bottom from getting soggy in the process of cooling. The traditional shengjian has pork fillings. Common variations include chicken, pork mixed with prawns, and pork mixed with crab meat. Serving Shengjian is traditionally sold in lots of four (one \\"tael\\"). It is usually eaten at breakfast, and can be accompanied by a small bowl of clear soup. The buns themselves can be dipped in Chinkiang vinegar. Because of the method of cooking, especially the relatively hard bottom, the buns are quite durable, and are therefore easily portable. They are often packed in paper bags for take-away consumption. Some shops or restaurants sell the item throughout the day as a dianxin or snack. It is rarely found as a dish in a main meal.

Christian apologist Tertullian in AD 197 considered this not an eclipse but a portent, which he claimed was recorded in Roman archives. The third-century Christian commentator Origen offered two natural explanations for the darkness: that it might have been the eclipse described by Phlegon of Tralles, or that it might have been clouds. Modern scholars have found no contemporary references to the darkness outside the New Testament, but have found mention of it in ancient writings that reference sources lost to us today, such as those of the Greek historian Thallus. Some scholars favour natural explanations such as a khamsin (sand storm). Others note that similar accounts were associated in ancient times and in the Old Testament with the deaths of notable figures, and see the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Biblical account The oldest biblical reference to the crucifixion darkness is found in the Gospel of Mark, written around the year 70. In its account of the crucifixion, on the eve of Passover, it says that after Jesus was crucified at nine in the morning; darkness fell over all the land, or all the world ( can mean either) from around noon (\\"the sixth hour\\") until 3 o'clock (\\"the ninth hour\\"). It adds, immediately after the death of Jesus, that \\"the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom\\". The Gospel of Matthew has an almost identical wording: \\"From noon on, darkness came over the whole land [or, earth] until three in the afternoon.\\" The author includes dramatic details, including an earthquake and the raising of the dead, which were also common motifs in Jewish apocalyptic literature: \\"The earth shook, and the rocks were split. The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.\\" The Gospel of Luke has none of the details of the Matthew version, mentions the tearing of the temple veil immediately before the death of Jesus, and provides the obscuring of the Sun as the cause of the darkness: > It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land [or, earth] > until three in the afternoon, while the sun's light failed [or, the sun was > eclipsed]; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. It appears that Luke's Gospel originally explained the event as an eclipse. The majority of manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have the Greek phrase (\\"the sun was darkened\\"), but the earliest manuscripts say (\\"the sun's light failed\\" or \\"the sun was in eclipse\\"). This earlier version is likely to have been the original one, amended by later scribes to correct what they assumed was an error, since they knew that an eclipse was impossible during Passover. One early Christian commentator even suggested that the text had been deliberately corrupted by opponents of the Church to make it easier to attack. In the account of the crucifixion given in the Gospel of John there is no mention of darkness, the tearing of the veil, or the raising of the dead. Later versions=Apocryphal writers A number of accounts in apocryphal literature built on the accounts of the crucifixion darkness. The Gospel of Peter, probably from the second century, expanded on the canonical gospel accounts in creative ways. As one writer puts it, \\"accompanying miracles become more fabulous and the apocalyptic portents are more vivid\\". In this version, the darkness which covers the whole of Judaea leads people to go about with lamps believing it to be night. The fourth century Gospel of Nicodemus describes how Pilate and his wife are disturbed by a report of what had happened, and the Judeans he has summoned tell him it was an ordinary solar eclipse. Another text from the fourth century, the purported Report of Pontius Pilate to Tiberius, claimed the darkness had started at the sixth hour, covered the whole world, and during the subsequent evening the full moon resembled blood for the entire night. In a fifth- or sixth-century text by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the author claims to have observed a solar eclipse from Heliopolis at the time of the crucifixion. Ancient historians No contemporary references to this darkness have been found outside of the New Testament. Tertullian, in his Apologeticus of AD 197, referred to the biblical crucifixion darkness and claimed that an independent account of the omen was held in the Roman archives: \\"And yet, nailed upon the cross, He exhibited many notable signs, by which His death was distinguished from all others. At His own free-will, He with a word dismissed from Him His spirit, anticipating the executioner‚Äôs work. In the same hour, too, the light of day was withdrawn, when the sun at the very time was in his meridian blaze. Those who were not aware that this had been predicted about Christ, no doubt thought it an eclipse. You yourselves have the account of the world-portent still in your archives.\\" In AD 248, the crucifixion darkness story was used by the Christian apologist Origen as an example of the biblical account being supported by non-Christian sources: when the pagan critic Celsus claimed that Jesus could hardly be a God because he had performed no great deeds, Origen responded, in Against Celsus, by recounting the darkness, earthquake and opening of tombs. As proof that the incident had happened, Origen referred to a description by Phlegon of Tralles of an eclipse, accompanied by earthquakes felt in other parts of the Empire during the reign of Tiberius. In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen offered a different approach. Answering criticisms that there was no mention of this incident in any of the many non- Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the Sun. In the ninth century, the Byzantine historian George Syncellus quoted from the third-century Christian historian Sextus Julius Africanus, who remarked that \\"Thallos dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse\\".George Syncellus, Chronography, chapter 391. It is not known when the chronicler Thallus lived, and it is unclear whether he himself made any reference to the crucifixion.  New World accounts of darkness  In the Huarochir√≠ Manuscript Spanish cleric Francisco de √Åvila records > In all the stories and fables of these people I have never been able to make > out which came first, or in what order they should be placed, for they are > all very ancient traditions. They relate that, a long time ago, the sun > disappeared and the world was dark for a space of five days; that the stones > knocked one against the other; and that the mortars, which they call mutca, > and the pestles called marop, rose against their masters, who were also > attacked by their sheep, both those fastened in the houses and those in the > fields. This p. 132 may have been the eclipse which occurred when our > Redeemer died; but I cannot clearly make this out, for when it was day in > that hemisphere it was night here, so that here the eclipse would have taken > place at night. The rest of the story consists of lies, for, as these people > had no watches, how could they tell that the sun was absent for five days, > seeing that we count days by the absence and presence of the sun? In El se√±or√≠o de los Incas, the second part of the Chronicle of Peru, Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n retells stories from the natives regarding Ticiviracocha (Viracocha). It describes a people that existed before the Incas that experienced a period of suffering without light. The people prayed and the sun rose from Lake Titicaca. Toward midday, a white man of great authority and veneration came, turning hills into plains and plains into hills, making fountains from stones, calling him the Maker of all things, originator of them, Father of the sun, and who caused animals and men to be. In the Book of Mormon which the Latter-Day Saint movement claims as scripture, an account is given of a period of darkness in the New World (Western Hemisphere) at the time of Christ's crucifixion and death. It is recorded as three days of darkness after a period of extreme storms and devastation.Book of Mormon, originally published and translated by Joseph Smith Jun., The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1830 Following the three days of darkness an account is given of the visit of the resurrected Jesus Christ to the inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere.Book of Mormon, originally published and translated by Joseph Smith Jun., The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1830 Explanations=Miracle Because it was known in ancient and medieval times that a solar eclipse could not take place during Passover (solar eclipses require a new moon while Passover only takes place during a full moon), it was considered a miraculous sign rather than a naturally occurring event. The astronomer Johannes de Sacrobosco wrote, in his The Sphere of the World, \\"the eclipse was not natural, but, rather, miraculous and contrary to nature\\". Modern writers who regard this as a miraculous event tend either to see it as operating through a natural phenomenon‚Äîsuch as volcanic dust or heavy cloud cover‚Äîor avoid explanation completely. The Reformation Study Bible, for instance, simply states \\"This was a supernatural darkness.\\" Natural phenomenon Khamsin dust storm in Egypt in 2007 The Gospel of Luke account states \\"and the sun was darkened\\"Luke 23:45. However, the biblical details do not accord with an eclipse: a solar eclipse could not have occurred on or near the Passover, when Jesus was crucified, and would have been too brief to account for three hours of darkness. The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse is seven minutes and 31.1 seconds. The only total eclipse visible in Jerusalem in this era occurred late in the year AD 29, on 24 November at 11:05 AM. Around the Sea of Galilee, it would have been visible for just one minute and forty-nine seconds. Some writers explained the crucifixion darkness in terms of sunstorms, heavy cloud cover, or the aftermath of a volcanic eruption. A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an 'oppressive gloom' and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes.Charles Ellicott, A New Testament commentary for English readers, 1878, page 176. In his 2011 book, unlike his 1983 paper, Humphreys accepted that Luke was referring to the Sun, and proposed a khamsin dust storm that tends to occur from March to May and typically obscures the sun for several hours. Scribal error In 1983, Colin Humphreys and W. G. Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the reported sun's darkness could be accounted for by confusion with a partial lunar eclipse that had taken place on 3 April AD 33: lunar eclipses can last much longer than solar ones. In other words, Humphreys and Waddington speculated that the apparent reference in Luke's Gospel to a solar eclipse could have been the result of a scribe wrongly amending Luke's original text. This is a claim that historian David Henige described as \\"indefensible\\". Astronomer Bradley E. Schaefer moreover stated that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible in Jerusalem during daylight hours. Literary creation A common view in modern scholarship is that the account in the synoptic gospels is a literary creation of the gospel writers, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event. Burton Mack describes it as a fabrication by the author of the Gospel of Mark, while G. B. Caird and Joseph Fitzmyer conclude that the author did not intend the description to be taken literally. W. D. Davies and Dale Allison similarly conclude \\"It is probable that, without any factual basis, darkness was added in order to wrap the cross in a rich symbol and/or assimilate Jesus to other worthies\\". The image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers as a cosmic sign, a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as Philo, Dio Cassius, Virgil, Plutarch and Josephus. G√©za Vermes describes the darkness account as \\"part of the Jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the Lord. It is to be treated as a literary rather than historical phenomenon notwithstanding naive scientists and over-eager television documentary makers, tempted to interpret the account as a datable eclipse of the sun. They would be barking up the wrong tree\\". Interpretations The earliest crucifixion in an illuminated manuscript, from the Syriac Rabbula Gospels, AD 586: note the Sun and Moon in the sky. This sequence plays an important part in the gospel's literary narrative. The author of Mark's gospel has been described as operating here \\"at the peak of his rhetorical and theological powers\\". One suggestion is that the darkness is a deliberate inversion of the transfiguration; alternatively, Jesus's earlier discourse about a future tribulation mentions the Sun being darkened, and can be seen as foreshadowing this scene. Striking details such as the darkening of the sky and the tearing of the temple veil may be a way of focusing the reader away from the shame and humiliation of the crucifixion; one professor of biblical theology concluded, \\"it is clear that Jesus is not a humiliated criminal but a man of great significance. His death is therefore not a sign of his weakness but of his power.\\" When considering the theological meaning of the event, some authors have interpreted the darkness as a period of mourning by the cosmos itself at the death of Jesus. Others have seen it as a sign of God's judgement on the Jewish people, sometimes connecting it with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in the year 70; or as symbolising shame, fear, or the mental suffering of Jesus. Fitzmyer compares the event to a contemporary description recorded in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which recounts \\"unlawful acts against the gods, from which we believe the very sun turned away, as if it too were loath to look upon the foul deed\\".Josephus, Antiquities, Book XIV 12:3 (text at Wikisource). Many writers have adopted an intertextual approach, looking at earlier texts from which the author of the Mark Gospel may have drawn. In particular, parallels have often been noted between the darkness and the prediction in the Book of Amos of an earthquake in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah: \\"On that day, says the Lord God, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight\\". Particularly in connection with this reference, read as a prophecy of the future, the darkness can be seen as portending the end times. Another likely literary source is the plague narrative in the Book of Exodus, in which Egypt is covered by darkness for three days. It has been suggested that the author of Matthew's gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source. Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day darkness by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah. Roman literary sources have also been postulated, namely those on the apotheosis of the mythical king Romulus, and about the death of Julius Caesar.

In its 17 years of existence, the railway provided frequent passenger and freight service over its length spanning most of the archipelago from St. George's in the east to Somerset, Sandys Parish, in the west. Construction and maintenance proved to be exceedingly costly, as the Bermuda Railway was built along a coastal route to minimize the amount of land acquisition needed for the right-of-way. In so doing, however, extensive trestles and bridgework were necessary. More than 10 percent of the line was elevated on 33 separate structures of timber or steel construction spanning the ocean. In addition, the proximity to the ocean made rot and corrosion a significant problem. This, along with the introduction of private automobiles to the island after World War II, would ultimately doom the line. Construction The Bermuda Railway was a single-track, standard- gauge line with 14 passing sidings. Construction began in 1926, two years after the Bermuda government granted a 40-year charter to the Bermuda Railway Company, but was not completed until 1931. The initial cost of construction and rolling stock purchase was about B$40 million (adjusted for inflation to dollars as of 2008), a staggering sum for such a short line with limited revenue potential. It was said to be one of the most expensive rail lines built, at a cost-per-mile of B$2 million. Operation and equipment A westbound Bermuda Railway train on one of the line's many coastal bridges, ca. 1940s, illustrating the line's construction and maintenance difficulties Rolling stock consisted of gasoline-powered passenger coaches built by Drewry Car Co. in England in 1929-1931, including eight self-propelled coaches powered by 120 h.p. petrol engines and six first class cars.Jones, Simon. \\"Bermuda carriages found in Guyana ‚Äì report\\", The Royal Gazette, 14 July 2015. Retrieved on 14 July 2015. The new venture also acquired a few freight cars and, during World War II, two diesel locomotives imported from the United States. Two classes of passenger accommodations were offered: first-class or \\"Pullman\\", with individual wicker chairs, and standard coaches, called \\"toast racks\\" because of their walkover seats (that is, the seat backs can be moved across the seat to face either direction of travel). Regular passenger service began between Hamilton and Somerset on October 31, 1931, operating from 6 a.m. to midnight at one- to two-hour intervals, depending on the time of day. Operations began between Hamilton and St George on December 19, 1931. Bermuda Railway trains were widely used in the 1930s by commuters, schoolchildren, and shoppers, as private automobiles were not allowed in Bermuda until 1946. Tourists in particular enjoyed the spectacularly scenic ride alongside the ocean's edge and through Bermuda's flower-covered hills. Special sightseeing excursions were run for cruise ship passengers. Following heavy usage by U.S. and British armed forces during World War II resulting from the influx of military personnel and the build-up of naval and air force facilities in Bermuda, the railway's fortunes rapidly declined after war's end. The large number of wooden trestles were found to have deteriorated significantly. Meanwhile, passenger volume fell by more than half between 1946 and 1947 on the \\"Rattle and Shake\\", as the line came to be known, due to patrons switching to automobile travel. The cost of infrastructure rehabilitation, combined with falling passenger levels and ever-increasing deficits, led the government to conclude that the Bermuda Railway should be abandoned in favour of bus service. After 17 years of operation, the last train ran on May 1, 1948. The rolling stock was later shipped to British Guiana (now Guyana), where they continued to run for several more years in the 1950s. Legacy Remaining piers of one of the railway's bridges In 1984, of the defunct rail line's right-of-way were dedicated as the Bermuda Railway Trail for hiking and, on some paved portions, biking. The Bermuda Tourism Department publishes a pamphlet describing the Trail's highlights, which Frommer's travel guide calls one of its \\"Favorite Bermuda Experiences\\", extolling its \\"panoramic seascapes, exotic flora and fauna, and soothing sounds of the island's bird life\\". A small Bermuda Railway museum operated in the old Aquarium Railway Station, just east of Flatts Village. The museum closed shortly before the death of the owner in 2011. In 2015, The Railway Magazine reported that two of the former Bermuda Railway freight cars still existed in Georgetown, Guyana, prompting calls for their possible restoration and future exhibit in Bermuda.

The Bullring by the Sea was opened in 1960. It is popularly known as \\"Playami\\", a portmanteau of \\"playa\\" and \\"Miami\\". History The current border between Baja California in Mexico and California in the United States was delineated in 1848. A marble monument was erected on the border near the shoreline in 1851. The borough began to be developed in 1957 with the fraccionamientos of Soler and Costa Azul. The name \\"Playas de Tijuana\\" was acquired in 1959. The Bullring by the Sea was opened in 1960. Development continued through the 1980s. Geography The borough of Playas de Tijuana is located in the city of Tijuana, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west, the United States ( California ) to the north, the municipality of Playas de Rosarito to the south and the boroughs Centro to the Northeast and San Antonio de los Buenos to the East. Playas de Tijuana borders the United States cities of Imperial Beach and San Diego, but there is no border crossing in the borough. In contrast to Playas de Tijuana, the Tijuana River Valley immediately north of the border remains rural and agricultural in character.  Administration  View of the U.S.-Mexico border fence from Playas de Tijuana, at the left. Before fortification Its administration or government relies on a Municipal Delegate, or Delegado Municipal , who is appointed by the Municipal President of Tijuana.

Plaza Coronado, which is located at the beginning of Paseo Ensenada, is the major entertainment centre, where mainly young people gather every day to spend free time. Water sports such as surfing, bodyboarding, and kayaking are available when ocean water quality is good‚Äîthe water quality can be very bad soon after it rains. The Monumental bullringPlaza Monumental is located here as well as the Tijuana campus of the Universidad Iberoamericana.Universidad Iberoamericana. Kids playing at sunset in Playas de Tijuana Playas de Tijuana has its own Arts & Culture House, which has many local and artistic endeavors, such as a ballet school, a drawing school, painting school, dancing school, and many others. The Arts & Culture House is located inside the complex where the local government building is, and also inside the complex there is another smaller bullfight ring, known as the Cortijo San Jos√©, which sometimes hosts rodeo shows. Along with the administration buildings, the House, and the Cortijo, there is a civic square where every September 15 is held the independence celebration. Playas de Tijuana is home to several NGO's that are leaders in local issues like sustainable development, clean water quality in local beaches and public policy like open space and parkland protection and against a number of housing developments that prevent free access to local beaches and urban sprawl and violence. Federal Highway 1-D starts just south of this borough towards Rosarito and Ensenada.

Foster, 5:04-cv-01569 (W.D. Okla. 2006), is a notable case involving intellectual property and file sharing/distribution of music. The case involves the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) filing a lawsuit against an Oklahoma woman, Deborah Foster, in November 2004. Proclaiming her innocence, she fought the allegations and eventually had the charges dismissed with prejudice in July 2006. Case Details Foster was originally sued in November 2004 after someone using an IP address assigned to an Internet account in her name was discovered with a shared folder available on a file-sharing network.Capitol v. Foster. Electronic Frontier Foundation. 25 April 2007 Foster admitted that she owned the account; however, she insisted ignorance concerning the existence and use of file-sharing software. Foster did say that her adult daughter and estranged husband had access to the account, and may have been responsible for the infringement. Instead of immediately dropping the case against Deborah Foster and suing those they believed were responsible for the alleged infringement, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add her daughter Amanda Foster, while keeping Ms. Foster as a co-defendant. (The RIAA was granted a default judgment against Amanda Foster after she failed to answer the RIAA's complaint.) The RIAA told Foster that she was liable for any infringement regardless of whether she had shared or downloaded files herself because she was the registered owner of the account. Foster responded by filing a counterclaim for a \\"declaratory judgment of noninfringement.\\" A year and a half after initially filing suit ( May 2005), the RIAA dropped their charges; however, Ms. Foster refused to drop her countersuit. In July 2006 a judge ruled that both the suit and countersuit be dropped; the latter since Ms. Foster was deemed to be the prevailing party in the matter. A major victory was achieved on February 7, 2007 with a ruling awarding Foster attorneys' fees from the matter.Bangeman, Eric. Victim of RIAA \\"driftnet\\" awarded attorneys' fees. Ars Technica, 25 April 2007. Challenged over the attorney costs she claimed as a result of what might have been considered a malicious prosecution, Foster sought discovery of the RIAA's own legal rates as a comparative. It was ruled that these rates would be made available and taken into account as a factor (though not the sole factor) in judging reasonableness. Despite the objection of the RIAA, the judge ruled that the rates should be produced, citing the legal precedent that \\"a party cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by his opponent in response\\". Citation from footnote 11 to City of Riverside v. Rivera On July 16, 2007 a federal judge in Oklahoma awarded Foster $68,685.23 in attorneys' fees. Deborah Foster was represented by Warren W.

She was a fishing schooner owned by John Glover of Marblehead, Massachusetts and was named for his daughter, Hannah Glover. The crew was drawn largely from the town of Marblehead, with much of the ships ammunition being stored in Glover's warehouse now located at Glover's Square in Marblehead before being relocated to Beverly, Massachusetts. Letter from General George Washington commissioning Nicholson Broughton to command a legal privateering mission against British forces Service history The schooner was hired into the service of the American Continental Army by General George Washington. Washington commissioned Nicholson Broughton to command the Hannah on 2 September 1775 and ordered the vessel to, :\\"...cruize against such vessels as may be found . . . bound inward and outward to and from Boston, in the service of the [British] army, and to take and seize all such vessels, laden with soldiers, arms, ammunition, or provisions . . . which you shall have good reason to suspect are in such service.\\" Hannah set sail from the harbor of Beverly, Massachusetts on 5 September 1775, but fled to the protection of the harbor of Gloucester, Massachusetts two days later under the pursuit of and a second British vessel. Leaving Gloucester Harbor, Hannah captured HMS Unity.  Washington's Fleet  Alongside other vessels fitted out by the Marblehead Regiment, the Franklin, the Warren, the Hancock, and the Lee, the first Continental navy was assembled on Boston's north shore. Three of the four captains of the ships were residents of Marblehead; John Selman (privateer), John Manley, and James Mugford who respectively commanded Warren, Lee and Franklin during 1775 and into 1776. Along with another Marblehead native and naval Captain Samuel Tucker, General Washington's Fleet raided enemy British ships up and down the Massachusetts coast. \\"With crews of experienced Marblehead seamen, these bold and highly skilled mariners captured enemy supply ships filled with ammunition and armaments that were crucial to the American cause of independence. The fleet was believed to have flown the Revolutionary \\"Pine Tree Flag\\" with the less common motto \\"An Appeal to God\\" signifying the crews' loyalty to their New England woodlands and their religion.Curatorial staff and exhibits of Abbot Hall, Marblehead, MA On one of the schooner's first voyages, it encountered the sloop Unity which was owned by John Langdon, a member of the Continental Congress from New Hampshire, but had been taken by the British Royal Navy. Rather than returning the ship to its rightful owner, Captain Broughton sailed the ship to Gloucester and requested he and his crew be given the store of salt fish beef and lumber. Washington's orders were to strictly collect munitions only, and his refusal caused a mutiny among the crew, of whom 14 were ordered whipped, but only one was punished. '.Peterson, Pam. \\"Marblehead 101: Marblehead and the American Revolution: 1775 the Hannah and the American Navy\\" Accessed at the Marblehead Historical Society and Museum, April 2016. Hannahs brief naval career ended on 10 October 1775, when she was run aground under the guns of a small American fort near Beverly by the British sloop Nautilus. After a 4 hour engagement between the British ship and Beverly and Salem militias on the shore, Hannah was saved from destruction and capture. Nautilus was badly damaged, but managed to escape with the rising tide around 8 p.m.. According to the New England Chronicle dated October 12th 1775, \\"...no lives were lost on our side, and the Privateer [Hannah] was damaged little if any\\". Other sources however still claim that Hannah was soon decommissioned as General Washington found more suitable ships for his cruisers. Fate  According to legend, soon after Hannahs decommissioning, the schooner was towed to Lee's Wharf in Manchester, where its name was changed to Lynch. There, the vessel was restored to working condition by 7 carpenters over the course of 3 weeks. In March of 1777, Lynch was sent to France with congressional correspondence for Benjamin Franklin, who was there as U.S. Ambassador. Upon embarking on their journey back to the U.S., Lynch and its crew were captured by British ship HMS Foudroyant. Lynch was sold as a prize by the British and documentation indicates that the schooner was used as a merchant vessel thereafter. Most modern scholars however believe the ship was completely destroyed or at least damaged beyond repair, thus rendering the true fate of the ship unknown. While no imagery of the ship is known to exist, trading and fishing schooners like the model pictured above, as well as those painted below, are commonly thought to be accurate representations. Marblehead welcome sign clearly claiming the town as \\"Birthplace of the American Navy\\"  Legacy  The City of Beverly, Massachusetts and the Town of Marblehead, Massachusetts each claim to have been the home port of the schooner. Each asserted the honor of being \\"the Birthplace of the American Navy\\" from the career of the Hannah until a plaque, currently on display in the Selectmen's room at Abbot Hall in Marblehead, was discovered in the Philadelphia Navy Yard proclaiming Marblehead to be the birthplace; Beverly has since reinvented itself as \\"Washington's Naval Base.\\" Alongside the plaque is a display detailing Marblehead's storied Naval history, especially focusing on the importance of the USS Hannah and the rest of the fleet that became the first of the United States Navy. Similarly, the entrance sign to the town of Marblehead features a small inset of an artist's depiction of the USS Hannah. In June of 1926 the town celebrated the 150th anniversary as birthplace of the Navy. In 1992, , another important Naval ship that protected Marblehead during the War of 1812, on its final unassisted voyage made a stop in Marblehead Harbor in 1992, before returning to Boston. One of the original gas stations in the town featured a facsimile piece of the hull of Hannah pictured below. After Hannah, Glover refitted five more schooners and personally launched another two from Plymouth. In the coming months though, the Continental Congress recognized the need for a Navy to accompany Washington's Army, smaller private boats such as Hannah fell out of favor. Along with much of the exhibit in Abbott Hall, the history of the town's involvement in the creation of the world's most powerful Navy has been meticulously reconstructed.Cheri Grishin, Assistant Director of the Marblehead Museum, 170 Washington Street.

These universal grants are called Statens Uddannelsesst√∏tte (SU: State Educational Support Grants). There are two kinds. There are grants for students attending secondary and tertiary school. Secondary school grants All students above age 18 are entitled to a free grant regulated partly by the income of their parents if they are below age 20. The basic rate for students living on their own and older than 20 is 5,941 DKK (as of 2016) a month. University grants When a student starts at a university or another kind of higher education institution, they are entitled to SU for a maximum of 72 months. As most university education (with the exception of medicine) takes five years in Denmark, it allows the student to take one year more on their studies than stipulated, or to change their major during their first year without economic consequences. Disability grants Any higher education student professionally diagnosed with a permanent disability, such as muscular dystrophy, blindness, deafness or autism, can apply for an additional grant of 8,051 DKK (about USD 1,364) a month. Student loans If needed, the student may supplement the grant with a student loan of 2,897 DKK (about USD 491) that has to be repaid when the student has completed his or her education. Thus a student will normally receive about 67,944 DKK (about USD 11,514) a year in grants with an optional 34,764 DKK (about USD 5,891) in loans, making a total of 102,708 DKK (about USD 17,405). The government granted SU loans have to be repaid once a student has graduated. Tuition All education in Denmark ranging from primary school, the Danish equivalent of high school gymnasiums as well as Universities and all other officially recognised forms of higher education are completely free of charge. Post-tertiary education Students at doctoral level (Ph.D. or similar) are not really considered students, and thus they do not receive a student grant. However, most Ph.D. candidates are employed by universities as researchers, and thus receive a fixed salary.

Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 Synopsis A woman would not marry except to a man with a blue beard. One day, a giant with a blue beard, a famous hunter, came to her parents' house, and she agreed to marry him. Because her new husband was rich, her mother considered what to give her and decided on three doves; she should send messages by the red dove if she were well and living peacably with her husband, by the white if she were ill, or by the black if she were unfortunate or in discord with her husband. Her husband went hunting and gave her nine keys, forbidding her to use one. She used it and found eight bodies of women, hanging up. She dropped the key, and it was stained with blood. Her husband demanded the keys and told her to go put on her finery, because she would die. The woman sent off the black dove and set the white dove to watch on the roof; then she stalled, saying that she was dressing a bride. The dove called that it could see nothing three times, and then three times reported that her brothers were respectively far off, approaching, and there. They broke into the house. Her husband claimed they were about to eat, but he fell asleep over dinner, either from drinking too much or a sleeping powder, and the brothers killed him.

The anus and inner buttocks may be wiped (typically with toilet paper, wet wipes, or gel wipes) or washed in order to remove remnants of fecal matter. In some cultures‚Äîsuch as many Western countries‚Äîcleaning after defecation is generally done with toilet paper only, although some may use wet wipes, until the person can bathe or shower. In Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim cultures, as well as in Southeast Asia and Southern Europe, water is usually used for anal cleansing, using a jet (bidet shower, bidet) or vessel (lota, aftabeh), and a person's hand (in some places only the left hand is used). Cleaning with water is sometimes followed by drying the anal region and hand with a cloth towel or toilet paper. On the other hand, in some parts of developing countries and during camping trips, materials such as vegetable matter (leaves), mudballs, snow (water), corncobs, and stones are sometimes used for anal cleansing. Having hygienic means for anal cleansing available at the toilet or site of defecation is important for overall public health. The absence of proper materials in households can, under some circumstances, be correlated to the number of diarrhea episodes per household.Herbst, S. (2006). Ecology and development series No. 43, 2006 ‚Äì Water, sanitation, hygiene and diarrheal diseases in the Aral Sea area. PhD thesis, G√∂ttingen: Cuvillier Verlag The history of anal hygiene, from ancient Rome and Greece to China and Japan, involves sponges and sticks as well as water and paper. Toilet paper A roll of toilet paper The use of toilet paper for post-defecation cleansing first started in China.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 123. It became widespread in Western culture. In some parts of the world, especially before toilet paper was available or affordable, the use of newspaper, telephone directory pages, or other paper products was common. The widely distributed Sears Roebuck catalog was also a popular choice until it began to be printed on glossy paper (at which point some people wrote to the company to complain). With flush toilets, using newspaper as toilet paper is likely to cause blockages. This practice continues today in parts of Africa; while rolls of toilet paper are readily available, they can be fairly expensive, prompting poorer members of the community to use newspapers. People suffering from hemorrhoids may find it more difficult to keep the anal area clean using only toilet paper and may prefer washing with water as well. Although wiping from front to back minimizes the risk of contaminating the urethra, the directionality of wiping varies based on sex, personal preference, and culture. Some people wipe their anal region standing, others wipe theirs sitting. Water Top view of a bidet A bidet shower or \\"health faucet\\"Water with soap cleansing is a reliable and hygienic way of removing fecal remnants.  Muslim societies  The use of water in Muslim countries is due in part to Islamic toilet etiquette which encourages washing after all instances of defecation.Fataawa al-Lajnah al- Daa‚Äôimah: 259 . accessed 29 June 2008 There are flexible provisions for when water is scarce: stones or papers can be used for cleansing after defecation instead. In Turkey, all Western-style toilets have a small nozzle on the centre rear of the toilet rim aiming at the anus. This nozzle is called taharet musluƒüu and it is controlled by a small tap placed within hand's reach near the toilet. It is used to wash the anus after wiping and drying with toilet paper. Squat toilets in Turkey do not have this kind of nozzle (a small bucket of water from a hand's reach tap or a bidet shower is used instead). Another alternative resembles a miniature shower and is known as a \\"health faucet\\", bidet shower, or \\"bum gun\\". It is commonly found to the right of the toilet where it is easy to reach. These are commonly used in the Muslim world. In the Indian subcontinent, a lota vessel is often used to cleanse with water, though the shower or nozzle is common among new toilets.  Indian subcontinent  In India and the Indian subcontinent, over 95% of the population use water for cleansing the anal area after defecating. Use of toilet paper is rare in this region and is seen only in some urban settings. Toilets commonly also have bidet sprayers. Even when toilet paper is used water-based cleansing is considered essential. The cleaning of hands with soap/ liquid soap after this cleansing process is very important. In places where soap is not available, soil, ash or sand is used to clean the hands. Simpler toilet rooms may not have running water for anal cleansing and hand washing, but buckets, bails, and mugs are used for storage of water and for the purpose of cleaning.  Southeast Asia  A Japanese toilet with integrated bidet spraying water for cleaning. The water jet is used to wash the anus and buttocks after defecation. In Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, house bathrooms usually have a medium size wide plastic dipper (called gayung in Indonesia, tabo in the Philippines, ‡∏Ç‡∏±‡∏ô (khan) in Thai) or large cup, which is also used in bathing. In Thailand, the \\"bum gun\\" is ubiquitous. Some health faucets are metal sets attached to the bowl of the water closet, with the opening pointed at the anus. Toilets in public establishments mainly provide toilet paper for free or dispensed, though the dipper (often a cut up plastic bottle or small jug) is occasionally encountered in some establishments. Owing to its ethnic diversity, restrooms in Malaysia often feature a combination of anal cleansing methods where most public restrooms in cities offer toilet paper as well as a built in bidet or a small hand-held bidet shower (health faucets) connected to the plumbing in the absence of a built-in bidet. In Vietnam, people often use a bidet shower. It is usually available both at general households and public places. East Asia The first \\"paperless\\" toilet seat was invented in Japan in 1980. A spray toilet seat, commonly known by Toto's trademark Washlet, is typically a combination of seat warmer, bidet and drier, controlled by an electronic panel or remote control next to the toilet seat. A nozzle placed at rear of the toilet bowl aims a water jet to the anus and serves the purpose of cleaning. Many models have a separate \\"bidet\\" function aimed towards the front for feminine cleansing. The spray toilet seat is common only in Western-style toilets, and is not incorporated in traditional style squat toilets. Some modern Japanese bidet toilets, especially in hotels and public areas, are labeled with pictograms to avoid language problems, and most newer models have a sensor that will refuse to activate the bidet unless someone is sitting on the toilet.A modern bidet of the traditional type, available in many southern European and South American countriesRoberto Zapperi: Zu viel Moralismus macht den K√∂rper schmutzig., in: FAZ, 24 aprile 2010.  Europe and the Americas  The bidet is common in predominantly Catholic countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing, Some people in Europe and the Americas use bidets for anal cleansing with water. Bidets are common bathroom fixtures in many Western and Southern European countries and many South American countries, L'historique du papier toilette et du bidetDecreto ministeriale Sanit√†, 5 July 1975, art. 7.Decreto- Lei n.¬∫ 650/75 de 18 de Novembro (in Portuguese), 18 November 1975, art. 84 while bidet showers are more common in Finland. The availability of bidets varies widely within this group of countries. Furthermore, even where bidets exist, they may have other uses than for anal washing. In Italy, the installation of bidets in every household and hotel became mandatory by law on July 5th, 1975. Decreto ministeriale Sanit√†, 5 July 1975, art. 7.  Other materials = Wet wipes and gel wipes  When cleaning babies' buttocks during diaper changes wet wipes are often used, in combination with water if available. As wet wipes are produced from plastic textiles made of polyester or polypropylene, they are notoriously bad for sewage systems as they do not decompose, although the wet wipe industry maintains they are biodegradable but not \\"flushable\\". A product of the 21st century, special foams, sprays and gels can be combined with dry toilet paper as an alternatives to wet wipes. A moisturizing gel can be applied to toilet paper for personal hygiene or to reduce skin irritation from diarrhea. This product is called gel wipe.  Cloths and paper  Rags or washcloths are sometimes used. They are then washed similarly to cloth diapers and used again. Newspaper may be used instead of toilet paper.  Natural materials  In rural areas of developing countries or during camping trips, stones, leaves, corn cobs and similar are also used for anal cleansing. This can be due to the unavailability of toilet paper or water. Examples by region or country * In East Asian, Western and multicultural societies, the Chinese-style use of toilet paper is widespread. Other paper products were also used before the advent of flush toilets. * Some European and South American countries use a bidet for additional cleaning. * In modern South Asia and Southeast Asia, handheld bidets or bidet showers are provided for use in toilets. * In Ancient Rome, a communal sponge was employed. It was rinsed in a bucket of salt water or vinegar after use. *In Ancient Greece, fragments of ceramic were sometimes used. * In Japan, flat sticks were used in ancient times (\\"shit sticks\\"), being replaced by toilet paper as the country became more Westernized. Toilets in Japan may include built-in bidets for anal cleansing with warm water. * In the Indian subcontinent, traditionally cleansing was done by using the left hand and water. Later the hands were washed thoroughly with water and dried, pulverized cow dung (considered antiseptic in Vedic culture) or clay. Today most Indians prefer soap to wash their hands.  History  ch≈´gi from the Nara period (710 to 784) in Japan. The modern rolls in the background are for size comparison. Ancient Greeks were known to use fragments of ceramic known as pessoi to perform anal cleansing. Roman anal cleansing was done with a sponge on a stick called a tersorium (). The stick would be soaked in a water channel in front of a toilet, and then stuck through the hole in front of the toilet for anal cleaning. The tersorium was shared by people using public latrines. To clean the sponge, they washed it in a bucket with water and salt or vinegar. This became a breeding ground for bacteria, causing the spread of disease in the latrine. In ancient Japan, a wooden skewer known as chuugi was used for cleaning after defecation.

Mark Horton implemented the first terminfo library in 1981‚Äì1982 as an improvement over termcap. The improvements include * faster access to stored terminal descriptions, * longer, more understandable names for terminal capabilities and * general expression evaluation for strings sent to the terminal. Terminfo was included with UNIX System V Release 2 and soon became the preferred form of terminal descriptions in System V, rather than termcap (which BSD continued to use). This was imitated in pcurses in 1982‚Äì1984 by Pavel Curtis, and was available on other UNIX implementations, adapting or incorporating fixes from Mark Horton. For more information, refer to the posting on the \`comp.sources.unix\` newsgroup from December 1986. A terminfo database can describe the capabilities of hundreds of different display terminals. This allows external programs to be able to have character-based display output, independent of the type of terminal. Some configurations are: *Number of lines on the screen *Mono mode; suppress color *Use visible bell instead of beep Data model Terminfo databases consist of one or more descriptions of terminals. Indices Each description must contain the canonical name of the terminal. It may also contain one or more aliases for the name of the terminal. The canonical name or aliases are the keys by which the library searches the terminfo database. Data values The description contains one or more capabilities, which have conventional names. The capabilities are typed: boolean, numeric and string. The terminfo library has predetermined types for each capability name. It checks the types of each capability by the syntax: * string capabilities have an \\"=\\" between the capability name and its value, * numeric capabilities have a \\"#\\" between the capability name and its value, and * boolean capabilities have no associated value (they are always true if specified). Applications which use terminfo know the types for the respective capabilities, and obtain the values of capabilities from the terminfo database using library calls that return successfully only when the capability name corresponds to one of the predefined typed capabilities. Like termcap, some of the string capabilities represent escape sequences which may be sent to the host by pressing special keys on the keyboard. Other capabilities represent strings that may be sent by an application to the terminal. In the latter case, the terminfo library functions (as does a termcap library) for substituting application parameters into the string which is sent. These functions provide a stack-based expression parser, which is primarily used to help minimize the number of characters sent for control sequences which have optional parameters such as SGR (Select Graphic Rendition). In contrast, termcap libraries provide a limited set of operations which are useful for most terminals. Hierarchy Terminfo descriptions can be constructed by including the contents of one description in another, suppressing capabilities from the included description or overriding or adding capabilities. No matter what storage model is used, the terminfo library returns the terminal description from the requested description, using data which is compiled using a standalone tool (e.g., tic). Storage model Terminfo data is stored as a binary file, making it less simple to modify than termcap. The data can be retrieved by the terminfo library from the files where it is stored. The data itself is organized as tables for the boolean, numeric and string capabilities, respectively. This is the scheme devised by Mark Horton, and except for some differences regarding the available names is used in most terminfo implementations. X/Open does not specify the format of the compiled terminal description. In fact, it does not even mention the common tic or infocmp utilities. Because the compiled terminfo entries do not contain metadata identifying the indices within the tables to which each capability is assigned, they are not necessarily compatible between implementations. However, since most implementations use the same overall table structure (including sizes of header and data items), it is possible to automatically construct customized terminfo libraries which can read data for a given implementation. For example, ncurses can be built to match the terminfo data for several other implementations. Directory tree The original (and most common) implementation of the terminfo library retrieves data from a directory hierarchy. By using the first character of the name of the terminal description as one component of the pathname, and the name of the terminal description as the name of the file to retrieve, the terminfo library usually outperforms searching a large termcap file. Hashed database Some implementations of terminfo store the terminal description in a hashed database (e.g., something like Berkeley DB version 1.85). These store two types of records: aliases which point to the canonical entry, and the canonical entry itself, which contains the data for the terminal capabilities. Limitations and extensions The Open Group documents the limits for terminfo (minimum guaranteed values), which apply only to the source file.Most of this was done before X/Open merged with Open Software Foundation to form The Open Group, consequently there are many sources that say X/Open. Two of these are of special interest: * 14 character maximum for terminal aliases * 32,767 maximum for numeric quantities The 14-character limit addresses very old filesystems which could represent filenames no longer than that. While those filesystems are generally obsolete, these limits were as documented from the late 1980s, and unreviewed since then. The 32,767 limit is for positive values in a signed two's complement 16-bit value. A terminfo entry may use negative numbers to represent cancelled or absent values. Unlike termcap, terminfo has both a source and compiled representation. The limits for the compiled representation are unspecified. However, most implementations note in their documentation for tic (terminal information compiler) that compiled entries cannot exceed 4,096 bytes in size.

The school's board of trustees was subsequently charged under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. They pleaded guilty to all charges at the court-case in April 2010, and were subsequently ordered to pay reparation and court costs totalling nearly $137,000.  International Students  International students make up for around 20% of the school roll. Germany and Japan have ongoing exchange programmes with the college - students stay from 3 months to 3 years. Other international students are immigrants to New Zealand and their high volume reflects that of the Northern Auckland population of high foreign immigrants, mostly from Asian countries.  Arts and Events Centre  Orewa College, along with the Rodney District Council decided to build a flexible, multi-use, modern auditorium and is now a valuable asset to the students and teachers of the college and the community. The OAEC offers several areas which can be booked for commercial or community events, and has 450sqm of flat floor space, and a seating capacity of up to 700. The Auditorium includes full audio visual facilities including 2 projectors & screens, sound system with microphone and standard lighting. Stage and special effect lighting is available when hiring school technicians. The Auditorium also includes efficient heat pump & air conditioning units. Statistics Orewa College students at the 2007 ANZAC Day parade At the December 2016 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, Orewa College had 1847 students, including 63 international students.

Providing student loans and grants is seen as a means to pave the way to higher education for children whose parents cannot afford to fund their children's education otherwise. The federal law that regulates these student loans and grants is called \\"Bundesausbildungsf√∂rderungsgesetz\\" (Federal Training Assistance Act) or \\"BAf√∂G\\" for short, and the loans, grants, and combinations thereof are usually referred to simply as \\"BAf√∂G\\" by students (as in \\"I'm receiving BAf√∂G\\"). Eligible groups include high school students, full-time university students, second path education students (i.e., those starting to study after having been in the workforce), and students of schools for professional training. Eligibility dependent on parent income The eligibility for student loans is (usually) dependent upon parent income, as parents are required by law to fund their children's education, including higher education. Therefore, students could theoretically sue their parents for funds for their education (although this is rarely done). For low-income families, BAf√∂G loans take over when these obligations cannot reasonably be met by parents. BAf√∂G loans are usually given out half as zero interest loan (to be repaid only after the receiver exceeds a certain income level after graduation) and half as grant money to university students. High school students get the full amount as grant money if they are eligible. The current maximum amount per month (for a university student) is 735.00 ‚Ç¨ (2017). For every own child below the age of 10, living in the student's household, an additional 130.00 ‚Ç¨ can be requested. This can be reduced gradually if student or parent income or student assets exceed certain amounts. Thus the amount paid out can be lower than the maximum amount, down to 10 ‚Ç¨ per month should the calculations return that amount. Even though such a low sum may seem pointless, they are beneficial to students as eligibility for a BAf√∂G loan (even at the minimum rate) makes the student eligible for other benefits like cut-rate telephone service or waiving of public television licence fees. Generally, BAf√∂G loans are independent of student achievement or grades for two years. After that, a certain minimum grade level has to be met and proof of participation is required to remain eligible. Change of field of study is allowed once during the first two years without becoming ineligible. For university studies, every field of study has a predefined maximum study duration (usually around five years), after which the student becomes ineligible for BAf√∂G. Further funds can be granted as low-interest loan for another two years if certain criteria (like reasonable likelihood that the student will graduate during that time) are met. To qualify for BAf√∂G, one must generally be a citizen or permanent resident of Germany and/or have lived in Germany for five consecutive years. There are some exceptions. Generally, BAf√∂G repayments are capped to a maximum of 10,000 ‚Ç¨ regardless of the total loan sum that was granted. An immediate repayment, fast graduation and very good grades can result in a reduced total amount.  Alternatives to BAf√∂G  Alternatives to BAf√∂G include the Bildungskredit (\\"study loan\\") from KfW, Bildungsfonds, and scholarships. However, in most cases to qualify for a private loan, one must have German citizenship, have EU citizenship and have resided in Germany for three consecutive years, or have graduated from a German secondary school. Eligibility independent from parent income In some cases, most notably if the student has worked full-time for a number of years before returning to student status, BAf√∂G eligibility is calculated independent from parent income, because parents' obligation to fund their children's education ends once the children enter the workforce full-time. In those cases, only student income and assets are consulted for BAf√∂G eligibility and amount calculation.

The decision demonstrates how domestic agreements, such as in between a mother and daughter, are presumed not to be legally binding unless there is clear intention. Facts A mother, Mrs Violet Lalgee Jones, agreed with her daughter, Mrs Ruby Padavatton, that if she would give up her secretary job at the Indian embassy in Washington DC and study for the bar in England, the mother would pay maintenance (from Trinidad, East Indian descent). The mother gave monthly payments of 42 pounds and then bought a London house (the daughter moved out of a one-room flat in Acton to 181 Highbury Quadrant, Highbury) which she lived in and rented out. Then they had a quarrel while Mrs Padavatton was still completing her bar exams at Lincoln's Inn. The mother brought an action for possession of the house. The daughter argued there was a binding contract that she could stay. Judgment The Court held that there was no binding contract. Although there would have been a contract if it was not the domestic parties related, there was insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption against domestic arrangements. Also, the Court of Appeal stated that the agreement would last until the daughter had passed her Bar finals; yet 5 years had elapsed and she had still not passed them, therefore the contract had elapsed.

The site gained national attention during the latter half of the 20th century due to selenium toxicity and rapid die off of migratory waterfowl, fish, insects, plants and algae within the Kesterson Reservoir.  Background  The Kesterson Reservoir is located in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley in central California. The reservoir and San Luis National Wildlife Refuge are located in western Merced County, approximately north of Los Banos, California. The refuge includes four units, the Kesterson, Freitas, Bear Creek and original San Luis Units. The refuge is and includes a variety of wetland and riparian habitat which supports a large variety of waterfowl, mammals and other wildlife. The San Joaquin Valley has been considered by historian Kevin Starr as being \\"the most productive unnatural environment on Earth\\" as approximately 25% of the United States‚Äô agricultural products originate from the valley. Examples of the agricultural exports from this area include grapes, cotton, nuts, citrus, and vegetables. Cattle and sheep ranching also contribute to the agricultural output of the area. To long time residents of the San Joaquin Valley is known as one of the richest farm lands in the world. In prehistoric times it was an inland lake where clams lived, their shells left behind made the land rich in phosphoric acid, good for growing crops. Yet modern farming requires adding more to the soil to re-supply nutrients lost to the growing crops (the old South learned that hard lesson). The water table is around 100 feet throughout the valley except possibly near the San Joaquin River where it may be swampy. At one point the river dried up due to farms using the water, the ecology movement stopped that. When the Delta Mendota Canals were put in place in the 60's and 70's, created to transport water to LA, the state opened up access to water to farmers also, and that created a new farming area known as \\"The West Side.\\" A land now rich in truck farming. What happened with Kesterson was the runoff that sat on land and became stagnant, as was spoke by a farm inspector whom worked in the canning industry, said that farmers overused fertilizers and over irrigated with flood irrigation led to water runoff containing the toxic additives when bacteria fermented with water lacking oxygen or drainage. Gradually this water and contaminants gravitated to the lowest land, water evaporated but contaminants did not. North of the San Joaquin River is the Sacramento River from further north. Both rivers meet at Sacramento, CA. The San Joaquin Valley is bordered on the west by the Coast Range and on the east by the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Coast Range include Cretaceous and Tertiary marine sedimentary rocks. Weathering and oxidation of the Moreno Formation, a black marine shale, produces Pyrite, FeS2, and Iron Selenide, FeSe2. As the weathered products concentrate in evaporative minerals and salts, selenates (for instance, Na2SeO4 ¬∑ 10 H2O or Na2Mg(SeO4)2 ¬∑ 4 H2O) and Sulfates (Na2SO4 ¬∑ 10 H2O or Na2Mg(SO4)4 ¬∑ 4 H2O) can form. This results in selenium salts and selenium rich soils that are sloughed off the mountains via debris flows or landslides into the San Joaquin valley. Additionally, the San Joaquin Valley has a shallow aquifer bounded by impermeable clays. The climate of the San Joaquin Valley does not lend itself well to agricultural production and results in large scale irrigation projects in order to keep fertile farms in operation. According to some estimates, the climate of the San Joaquin Valley has approximately of precipitation and over of evaporation annually. In order to keep the area productive, irrigation is a requirement. A side effect of irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was that ground water levels began to rise over time. This led to a condition where excess water was accumulating and starting to harm crops. In 1968, the Bureau of Reclamation created the 134 km long San Luis Drain and the Kesterson Reservoir. Farmers in the San Joaquin valley installed drainage tiles in an effort to maintain water tables at 2 meters. The Kesterson reservoir was completed in 1971 by the Bureau of Reclamation and consisted of 12 evaporation ponds within the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge. Contamination Due to the concentration of selenium in the Coast Range west of the San Joaquin Valley, selenium was transported into the valley and naturally accumulated on the valley floor. Selenium toxicity began to become a problem shortly after drainage tiles were installed. Initially (from 1971‚Äì78), the reservoir was receiving all fresh water. After 1978, this began to change and by 1981, all water coming into the Kesterson Reservoir was saline drain water. Contributing to the salinity of the drain water was the highly-mobile ion of selenium, selenate, SeO42‚àí. Selenium begin to bioaccumulate in the waterfowl and wildlife that used the reservoir. Prior to 1981, the Kesterson Reservoir supported a wide variety of life, including several species of fish. After 1981, the reservoir only supported the most saline tolerant mosquito fish. The habitat change occurred quickly and also included algal blooms and disappearing waterfowl. In 1982, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a study to determine the cause for declining wildlife use at the reservoir. Selenium concentrations at these locations were found to be greater than 1400 micrograms per liter.

Coinduction is the mathematical dual to structural induction. Coinductively defined types are known as codata and are typically infinite data structures, such as streams. As a definition or specification, coinduction describes how an object may be \\"observed\\", \\"broken down\\" or \\"destructed\\" into simpler objects. As a proof technique, it may be used to show that an equation is satisfied by all possible implementations of such a specification. To generate and manipulate codata, one typically uses corecursive functions, in conjunction with lazy evaluation.

Homelessness is a worrying and relatively large problem in New York City, with approximately 100,000 experiencing homelessness each year. Such an environment can frequently lead to a difficult upbringing for children unfortunate enough to find themselves in this position. The result is that many children grow up unable to experience the sort of childhood so often taken for granted; material goods are often unattainable; on occasion families cannot afford to adequately clothe or even feed their children and additionally, such children miss out on experiences often regarded as a rite of passage, instead condemned to a childhood of tough city living. Against this background, Camp Lanowa and its sister camps attempt to offer such opportunities to these children and provide an escape from the tough inner city life. Overview Camp Lanowa is the larger of the two summer camps operated by Homes for the Homeless. Situated in Harriman State Park, New York, Lanowa runs three sessions lasting approximately two weeks each throughout the summer for under privileged children from New York. Camp Lanowa caters for an 'older' age range of around 10‚Äì14 years old, although variations are possible; its sister camp, Camp Wakonda, caters to younger children as young as 7 years old. The HFH camps offer the opportunity for underprivileged children to experience life away from the daily grind of city life and enjoy the wonders of the natural world; many of the children attending camp have never experienced the 'great outdoors'. Many activities are offered with the duel aims of enriching the children's life by offering opportunities to experience the wonderment of the outdoor world and by offering activities which are both aimed to be fun and educational. These include; Arts and Crafts, Computers, Learning Centre, Nature, Swimming, fishing, evening activities and overnight camping trips, to name but a few. The camp is staffed by a wide variety of people from different cultures and countries, which adds to the life enhancing experience for both the children and indeed the staff.

It enables programs to use display computer terminals in a device-independent manner, which greatly simplifies the process of writing portable text mode applications. Bill Joy wrote the first termcap library in 1978Peter H. Salus, \\"The history of Unix is as much about collaboration as it is about technology\\", Byte, October 1994.Kenneth C. R. C. Arnold and Elan Amir, \\"Screen Updating and Cursor Movement Optimization: A Library Package\\" for the Berkeley Unix operating system; it has since been ported to most Unix and Unix-like environments, even Multics.https://multicians.org/mtbs/mtb767.html Joy's design was reportedly influenced by the design of the terminal data store in the earlier Incompatible Timesharing System.alt.sys.pdp10 posting A termcap database can describe the capabilities of hundreds of different display terminals. This allows programs to have character-based display output, independent of the type of terminal. On-screen text editors such as vi and emacs are examples of programs that may use termcap. Other programs are listed in the Termcap category. Examples of what the database describes: *how many columns wide the display is *what string to send to move the cursor to an arbitrary position (including how to encode the row and column numbers) *how to scroll the screen up one or several lines *how much padding is needed for such a scrolling operation. Data model Termcap databases consist of one or more descriptions of terminals. Indices Each description must contain the canonical name of the terminal. It may also contain one or more aliases for the name of the terminal. The canonical name or aliases are the keys by which the library searches the termcap database. Data values The description contains one or more capabilities, which have conventional names. The capabilities are typed: boolean, numeric and string. The termcap library has no predetermined type for each capability name. It determines the types of each capability by the syntax: * string capabilities have an \\"=\\" between the capability name and its value, * numeric capabilities have a \\"#\\" between the capability name and its value, and * boolean capabilities have no associated value (they are always true if specified). Applications which use termcap do expect specific types for the commonly used capabilities, and obtain the values of capabilities from the termcap database using library calls that return successfully only when the database contents matches the assumed type. Hierarchy Termcap descriptions can be constructed by including the contents of one description in another, suppressing capabilities from the included description or overriding or adding capabilities. No matter what storage model is used, the termcap library constructs the terminal description from the requested description, including, suppressing or overriding at the time of the request. Storage model Termcap data is stored as text, making it simple to modify. The text can be retrieved by the termcap library from files or environment variables. Environment variables The TERM environment variable contains the terminal type name. The TERMCAP environment variable may contain a termcap database. It is most often used to store a single termcap description, set by a terminal emulator to provide the terminal's characteristics to the shell and dependent programs. The TERMPATH environment variable is supported by newer termcap implementations and defines a search path for termcap files. Flat file The original (and most common) implementation of the termcap library retrieves data from a flat text file. Searching a large termcap file, e.g., 500 kB, can be slow. To aid performance, a utility such as reorder is used to put the most frequently used entries near the beginning of the file. Hashed database BSD-4.4 based implementations of termcap store the terminal description in a hashed database (e.g., something like Berkeley DB version 1.85). These store two types of records: aliases which point to the canonical entry, and the canonical entry itself. The text of the termcap entry is stored literally. Limitations and extensions The original termcap implementation was designed to use little memory: * the first name is two characters, to fit in 16 bits * capability names are two characters * descriptions are limited to 1023 characters. * only one termcap entry with its definitions can be included, and must be at the end. Newer implementations of the termcap interface generally do not require the two-character name at the beginning of the entry. Capability names are still two characters in all implementations. The tgetent function used to read the terminal description uses a buffer whose size must be large enough for the data, and is assumed to be 1024 characters. Newer implementations of the termcap interface may relax this constraint by allowing a null pointer in place of the fixed buffer,The GNU Termcap Library or by hiding the data which would not fit, e.g., via the ZZ capability in NetBSD termcap.NetBSD termcap file format The terminfo library interface also emulates the termcap interface, and does not actually use the fixed-size buffer. The terminfo library's emulation of termcap allows multiple other entries to be included without restricting the position. A few other newer implementations of the termcap library may also provide this ability, though it is not well documented.Discussion of termcap in vi Obsolete features A special capability, the \\"hz\\" capability, was defined specifically to support the Hazeltine 1500 terminal, which had the unfortunate characteristic of using the ASCII tilde character ('~') as a control sequence introducer. In order to support that terminal, not only did code that used the database have to know about using the tilde to introduce certain control sequences, but it also had to know to substitute another printable character for any tildes in the displayed text, since a tilde in the text would be interpreted by the terminal as the start of a control sequence, resulting in missing text and screen garbling. Additionally, attribute markers (such as start and end of underlining) themselves took up space on the screen. Comments in the database source code often referred to this as \\"Hazeltine braindamage\\". Since the Hazeltine 1500 was a widely used terminal in the late 1970s, it was important for applications to be able to deal with its limitations.

It includes multiple varieties, the most prominent being Quebec French. Formerly Canadian French referred solely to Quebec French and the closely related varieties of Ontario (Franco-Ontarian) and Western Canada‚Äîin contrast with Acadian French, which is spoken by Acadians in New Brunswick (including the Chiac dialect) and some areas of Nova Scotia (including the dialect St. Marys Bay French). PEI and Newfoundland & Labrador have Newfoundland French. In 2011, the total number of native French speakers in Canada was around 7.3 million (22% of the entire population), while another 2 million spoke it as a second language. At the federal level, it has official status alongside Canadian English. At the provincial level, French is the sole official language of Quebec as well as one of two official languages of New Brunswick and jointly official (derived from its federal legal status) in Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Government services are offered in French at select localities in Manitoba, Ontario (through the French Language Services Act) and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the country, depending largely on the proximity to Quebec and/or French Canadian influence on any given region. In New Brunswick, all government services must be available in both official languages. New England French (a dialect spoken in northern New England) is essentially a variety of Canadian French and exhibits no particular differences from the Canadian dialects, unlike Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole. Dialects and varieties Quebec French is spoken in Quebec. Closely related varieties are spoken by francophone communities in Ontario, Western Canada and the New England region of the United States, differing only from Quebec French primarily by their greater conservatism. The term Laurentian French has limited applications as a collective label for all these varieties, and Quebec French has also been used for the entire dialect group. The overwhelming majority of francophone Canadians speak this dialect. Acadian French is spoken by over 350,000 Acadians in parts of the Maritime Provinces, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, the Lower North Shore and the Gasp√© peninsula.Ethnologue report for Canada St. Marys Bay French is a variety of Acadian French spoken in Nova Scotia. M√©tis French is spoken in Manitoba and Western Canada by the M√©tis, descendants of First Nations mothers and voyageur fathers during the fur trade. Many M√©tis spoke Cree in addition to French, and over the years they developed a unique mixed language called Michif by combining M√©tis French nouns, numerals, articles and adjectives with Cree verbs, demonstratives, postpositions, interrogatives and pronouns. Both the Michif language and the M√©tis dialect of French are severely endangered. Newfoundland French is spoken by a small population on the Port-au-Port Peninsula of Newfoundland. It is endangered‚Äîboth Quebec French and Acadian French are now more widely spoken among Newfoundland francophones than the distinctive peninsular dialect. Brayon French is spoken in the area around Edmundston, New Brunswick, and, to a lesser extent, Madawaska, Maine, and Beauce of Quebec. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is morphosyntactically identical to Quebec French.Geddes, James (1908). Study of the Acadian-French language spoken on the north shore of the Baie-des-Chaleurs. Halle: Niemeyer; Wittmann, Henri (1995) \\"Grammaire compar√©e des vari√©t√©s coloniales du fran√ßais populaire de Paris du 17e si√®cle et origines du fran√ßais qu√©b√©cois.\\" in Fournier, Robert & Henri Wittmann. Le fran√ßais des Am√©riques. Trois-Rivi√®res: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivi√®res, 281‚Äì334. It is believed to have resulted from a localized levelling of contact dialects between Qu√©b√©cois and Acadian settlers. New England French is spoken in parts of New England in the United States. Essentially a local variant of Quebec French, it is one of three major forms of French that developed in what is now the United States, the others being Louisiana French and the nearly-extinct Missouri French. It is endangered, though its use is supported by bilingual education programs in place since 1987. Sub-varieties There are two main sub-varieties of Canadian French. Joual is an informal variety of French spoken in working- class neighbourhoods in Quebec. Chiac is a blending of Acadian French syntax and vocabulary with numerous lexical borrowings from English. Historical usage The term \\"Canadian French\\" was formerly used to refer specifically to Quebec French and the closely related varieties of Ontario and Western Canada descended from it.Francard and Latin, in Le r√©gionalisme lexical, write: :\\"Le fran√ßais du Qu√©bec a rayonn√© en Ontario et dans l'ouest du Canada, de m√™me qu'en Nouvelle-Angleterre. [...] Le fran√ßais qu√©b√©cois et le fran√ßais acadien peuvent √™tre regroup√©s sous l'appellation plus large de fran√ßais canadien2, laquelle englobe aussi le fran√ßais ontarien et le fran√ßais de l'Ouest canadien. Ces deux derniers poss√®dent des traits caract√©ristiques qui leur sont propres aujourd'hui dans l'ensemble canadien et qui s'expliquent surtout par un ph√©nom√®ne de conservatisme, mais il s'agit de vari√©t√©s qui sont historiquement des prolongements du fran√ßais qu√©b√©cois. : 2Il faut noter ici que le terme de ¬´fran√ßais canadien¬ª avait autrefois un sens plus restreint, d√©signant le fran√ßais du Qu√©bec et les vari√©t√©s qui s'y rattachent directement, d'o√π l'emploi √† cette √©poque de ¬´canadianisme¬ª pour parler d'un trait caract√©ristique du fran√ßais du Qu√©bec.\\" This is presumably because Canada and Acadia were distinct parts of New France, and also of British North America, until 1867. The term is no longer usually deemed to exclude Acadian French. Phylogenetically, Quebec French, M√©tis French and Brayon French are representatives of koin√© French in the Americas whereas Acadian French, Cajun French, and Newfoundland French are derivatives of non-koin√© local dialects in France.Robert Fournier & Henri Wittmann. 1995. Le fran√ßais des Am√©riques. Trois-Rivi√®res: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivi√®res. Use of anglicisms The term anglicism () is related to the linguistic concepts of loanwords, barbarism, diglossia or the macaronic mixture of the French (fran√ßais) and English (anglais) languages According to some, French spoken in Canada includes many anglicisms. The \\"\\" (Language Troubleshooting Database) by the office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaisehttp://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/ distinguishes between different kinds of anglicisms: * The entire anglicisms are words or groups of loan words from the English language. The form is often exactly the same as in English, e.g. : \\"glamour\\", \\"short\\" and \\"sweet\\", but sometimes there is a slight adjustment to the French language, e.g.: \\"\\", which comes from the English word \\"drab\\". * The hybrid anglicisms, which are new words, a combination of an English word to which a French element is added. This element (a suffix, for instance) sometimes replaces a similar element of the English word. \\"\\" is an example of hybrid anglicism: it is made up of the English verb \\"to boost\\", to which the French suffix ‚Äìer is added. * Plenty of anglicisms are semantic anglicisms: they are French words used in a sense which exists in English, but not in French. (\\"postpone\\") in the sense of \\"to have a break\\", in the sense of \\"miserable\\" or \\"pitiful\\", (\\"floor/surface\\") in the sense of \\"floor\\" (level of a building) and (\\"harm/injury\\") in the sense of \\"(unfavorable) opinion\\". * The syntactic anglicisms are those relating to the word order of a sentence and the use of prepositions and conjunctions. The expression \\"\\" (\\"a good ten minutes\\"), for instance, comes from the English language; the more conventional French wording would be \\"\\". The use of the preposition (\\"for\\") after the verbs (\\"ask [for]\\") and (\\"search/look [for]\\") is also a syntactic anglicism. * The morphological anglicisms are literal translations (or ) of the English forms. With this kind of loan words, every element comes from the French language, but what results from it as a whole reproduces, completely or partly, the image transmitted in English. The word , for instance, is formed under English influence and does not exist in standard French (which would instead use the phrasing \\"\\"). (\\"all year long\\"), (\\"conference call\\") and (\\"list price\\") are other morphological examples of anglicisms. * Finally, the sentencial anglicisms are loan set phrases or images peculiar to the English language. The expressions (\\"add insult to injury\\") and (\\"ring a bell\\") are sentencial anglicisms. Law 101 could postpone the advance of the phenomenon or even prevent it. Academic, colloquial and pejorative terms are used in Canada (such as (from , \\"pidgin\\"), Franglais, Fran√ßais qu√©b√©cois, Canadian French) to refer to the vernacular.

The other four were the Conveyor, the Skeena, the Distributor and the Omineca. Three of these, the Conveyor, the Operator and the Distributor were built at Victoria, British Columbia, in 1908 by Alexander Watson Jr.  Skeena River  The Operator began her work on the Skeena River in 1909 under the command of Captain \\"Con\\" Myers. She and the other four Foley, Welch and Stewart sternwheelers had their work cut out for them. The construction of the railway from Prince Rupert to Hazelton was one of the most difficult sections of track that would ever be laid in North America. This 186-mile stretch would take nearly four years to build and would employ thousands of workers. At the end of the season of navigation in 1911, the Operator and her sister ship Conveyor were finished on the Skeena, but would continue to work on the Grand Trunk Pacific from the other end of construction on the upper Fraser River.  Fraser River  The Operator and the Conveyor were both taken down to Victoria and dismantled and their machinery and equipment was put in boxcars and shipped by rail to Jasper, Alberta, and then to the end of steel at the eastern end of construction. Because the tracks hadn't reached the head of navigation yet, the boilers and other equipment had to be hauled by mule wagon the last 25 miles to the shipyard at T√™te Jaune Cache. It was a difficult and dangerous operation, taking a full week, and one construction worker was killed. At T√™te Jaune Cache, the machinery was put into new hulls and the two new ships were once again named Operator and Conveyor and both were put back under the command of their old captains. Both were launched on at T√™te Jaune Cache on May 12, 1912. The Operator was a large and powerful steamer, capable of carrying 200 passengers, 200 tons of freight, and could also handle a 100-ton barge. In 1912, the Operator and the Conveyor began work on the upper Fraser but were confined to the area around T√™te Jaune Cache as it was a season of very low water and river navigation for these large sternwwheelers was nearly impossible. The Operator and the Conveyor worked regularly during the season of 1913 and then were berthed for the winter at Mile 142 on the downriver side of a new low-level bridge that had just been built, which had cut off navigation for sternwheelers to go further upriver. This bridge had come as an unpleasant surprise to the BC Express Company, which had been promised that the bridges along the upper Fraser would be built with lift-spans to allow sternwheelers access to travel underneath them. However, the low-level bridge made no difference to the two Foley, Welch and Stewart boats, who were finished on this section of the upper Fraser. In 1914, their next task would be to work on the construction for the Pacific Great Eastern Railway which was being built from Fort George south. Their new route would take them from Fort George to Soda Creek. The Operator and the Conveyor worked this route from May to August 1914, serving the new work camps and hauling supplies and equipment for rail construction. However, that August would bring the onset of the Great War and the halting of construction of the Pacific Great Eastern. The Conveyor and the Operator both ceased work immediately and were hauled out of the river and left to rot at Foley's Cache at Fort George.

He is the first character to assume the identity of Azrael, a member of a group of assassins who were created by the Order of St. Dumas to bring justice in Gotham City. He debuted in Batman: Sword of Azrael #1 (October 1992) as an ally of the superhero Batman, after which he would go on to make appearances in a number of Batman titles, most notably Knightfall, where he took on the identity of Batman for some time. The character portrayed as a vigilante with good intentions, though he and Batman have also been at odds as a result of the Order's brainwashing of Valley. Publication history The character first appeared in the 1992 four-issue miniseries Batman: Sword of Azrael as Jean-Paul Valley. He then became a supporting character in the monthly Batman titles, eventually taking over the role of BatmanManning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 260: \\"By Batman #500, the last chapter of the 'Knightfall' saga by writer Doug Moench and artist Jim Aparo and Mike Manley, Azrael was truly his own [version of] Batman.\\" through the \\"Knightfall\\", \\"Knightquest\\", and \\"KnightsEnd\\" story arcs. One of the creators, Denny O'Neil, admitted to having difficulties with Azrael's transition from villain to hero: \\"If I'd known he was to become a monthly character, I might have set him up differently ... The problem is that I had to turn a bad guy into a real hero, not just an anti-hero or lead. It's possible to do that, but it's difficult to retain the original characterization. You almost have to change his personality.\\" The subsequent Azrael series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between 1995 and 2003. Starting with issue #47, it was retitled to Azrael: Agent of the Bat in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman mythos, including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, Robin, and the new Batgirl. Fictional character biography Jean-Paul Valley, a university graduate student of computer science in Gotham City, is unaware that he is the latest in a line of assassin-enforcers for \\"The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas\\", a sinister religious secret society. For most of his life, he has been brainwashed with The System, a deep level of psychological conditioning. Valley only learned of his new status upon the death of his father, who was also his predecessor, at which time his conditioning was activated and he was called upon to take up the mantle of Azrael.Batman: Sword of Azrael #1 When he was sent by the Order to kill weapons dealer Carlton LeHah, a rogue member of the Order who turned against the others and killed Valley's father, he crossed paths with Batman, who had been investigating the death. He worked with Alfred Pennyworth to find LeHah after he had captured Bruce Wayne, using the Batman costume to kill the other Order members. Valley worked with Alfred, demonstrating a detective's intuition in tracking LeHah's movements and later risking himself to rescue Bruce despite his traditional mission of vengeance. In doing so, he was shown the error of his ways and decided to fight alongside Batman against the criminals of Gotham, rejecting his \\"birthright\\" and seeking Batman's help in breaking his conditioning to forge his own destiny. His name is not revealed to Alfred and Bruce until the end of the story, at which point he claims it also was his father's name (a later storyline in his solo series stated his father's name to be Ludovic Valley, however). Valley is given a job as a security guard at WayneTech headquarters, and also becomes an apprentice crimefighter alongside Batman and Robin, learning basic detective work. Valley plays a pivotal role in the Knightfall story arc (1993‚Äì1994), in which he stands in as Batman after Bruce Wayne is defeated and paralyzed at the hands of Bane. He decides that Bruce's tactics as Batman are obsolete and believes that he must fight criminals on their terms which makes him far more brutal and merciless, often even showing little regard for innocent bystanders. Against Bruce Wayne's orders, Valley fights and defeats Bane, wearing enhanced battle-armor he designed and built under the influence of the System after he was narrowly defeated by Bane in their first confrontation.Batman #500 His performance as Batman is influenced by his Azrael conditioning. He grows increasingly violent and delusional, allowing the mass murderer Abattoir to fall to his death, thereby also allowing one of Abattoir's still-living hostages to die.Batman #508 Valley also has control problems with Tim Drake's partnership, emphasized when Valley almost strangles him to death and bans him from the Batcave. He seals off the Batcave from Wayne Manor and the Drake property, and eschews working with Commissioner Gordon and the Gotham police. Valley also suffers from continuous hallucinations of both his father and St. Dumas who tell him that he is the real Batman and that he must avenge his father's death (having convinced himself that Lehah was just the man who instigated his father's death while one of the man's former henchmen actually pulled the trigger). Initially, Wayne is impressed enough with Valley's results to let him remain as Batman, but when Drake tells Wayne of Abattoir's death, he resolves to reclaim the Batman mantle. With his back repaired thanks to the sacrifice of psychic healer Doctor Shondra Kinsolving, and his fighting instincts rehabilitated after lessons with Lady Shiva, Wayne goes after Valley to reclaim his identity. After a prolonged battle that stretches from a Gotham penthouse to a major bridge before culminating in a final showdown in the Batcave, Bruce tricks Valley into removing his armor, excluding his helmet (with night-vision lenses engaged), and exposes him to bright sunlight - the shock snaps Valley out of his delusional state. Acknowledging Bruce Wayne as the true Batman, Valley apologizes and asks for his forgiveness, which Bruce accepts, recognizing his own role in Valley's descent into madness during his time as Batman, but tells Valley to leave Wayne Manor immediately. Valley lives among the homeless population of Gotham for several weeks, befriending an alcoholic former psychiatrist named Brian Bryan. Valley is then sought out by Bruce Wayne, who feels responsible for his mental breakdown after attaining and losing the mantle of Batman. Bruce grants him a small fortune in money, information on the Order of St. Dumas' whereabouts, and resources to explore his origins. Along with Bryan, he discovers the evil conspiracies within the order of St. Dumas, and they help a nun named Sister Lilhy escape. With the help of Ra's al Ghul, Valley discovers that he is a genetically engineered test tube baby, and his genes have been spliced with those of animals. He returns to Gotham for several crossover events, including Underworld Unleashed, Contagion, Legacy, and Cataclysm. He also discovers that his father's killer, Carlton LeHah, is still alive. Valley attempts to regain Batman's trust after the events of the KnightsEnd arc. Batman, who feels responsible for Valley, especially after realizing that he gave him very little training and support, decides to give Azrael missions to carry out as a test to prove himself. The first of these missions is to defeat a resurfaced Bane, but it is not until Azrael saves the lives of a group of U.S. Senators (one of which tries to plead to Congress for the funds to rebuild Gotham City after its devastating earthquake) that Batman begins to fully trust him again. Prior to those events, Batman sent Azrael after Nicholas Scratch, who was planning to kill another Senator who also wanted federal money to save Gotham City. While pursuing Scratch, Azrael was framed for the Senator's murder after he was strangled to death moments before Azrael arrived to save him. After being framed, Azrael is given a new costume designed by Batman and uses it for a time, especially during the No Man's Land story arc. Azrael helps Batman maintain a chaotic Gotham City, often with the assistance of the new Batgirl, and protects Leslie Thompkins' medical clinic inside of No Man's Land. After foiling Scratch's plan of framing him for murder, Azrael returns to his original costume and battles hallucinations that represent both his father and St. Dumas himself. Toward the end of the series, Azrael is plagued by supernatural occurrences in the form of possible miracles. Azrael is seemingly killed in the series' final issue, shot with two specially-coated bullets while battling Scratch and LeHah. Scratch is arrested, and LeHah falls into the river with Azrael. However, Azrael's body is never recovered, and his death went unconfirmed for several years. In Booster Gold (vol. 2) #10, a note can be seen written on time traveler Rip Hunter's chalk board reading \\"Jean- Paul Valley Lives!\\" In the following issue, another note says, \\"Azrael comes and goes.\\" Azrael appears in Blackest Night #4 as an undead member of the Black Lantern Corps; although at first it had not been confirmed whether it was Jean-Paul Valley or another Azrael (such as Ludovic Valley, who died in Gotham City). The index section of the Blackest Night tabloid later indicated that it was in fact Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul Valley makes a cameo at Batman's funeral service in Neil Gaiman's 2009 story Batman: Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader? He is seen stepping up to deliver his own version of Batman's death as a background event, however his story is unseen and he has no lines. The story is metaphysical in nature, not affecting the overall status of the canon or Azrael's fate.  The New 52  In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Jean-Paul Valley reappeared as Azrael in an arc of Batman & Robin: Eternal. His design was updated, with his main weapon being his sword rather than gauntlets (although he was later shown to still possess the gauntlet blades). His character, however, was essentially the same, working as an enforcer for the Order of St. Dumas. In the comic, he defeated Bane and eventually turned on his handler and the Order to assist Red Hood and Tim Drake. This marked the first proper appearance of a living Jean- Paul Valley in the DCU in over a dozen years, with previous appearances relegated to either minimal cameos or the aforementioned Black Lantern revival of the character.Batman and Robin: Eternal #9 DC Rebirth In 2016, Jean Paul made his post Rebirth debut in the first issue of the Detective Comics line, starting with issue #934. Jean Paul made a few cameo appearances in the first two issues before joining the roster fully in issue #943. After something was done to his suit by Ascalon, Luke Fox gave him a new suit inspired by Batman and after the fight Azrael went back to his old suit.Detective Comics #962 After Batwoman invited Azrael and Batwing to join her colony, they agree in hopes to reshape the colony.Detective Comics #976 Azrael has been confirmed to join the new Justice League team Justice League Odyssey in 2018. Powers and abilities As Azrael, Jean-Paul has enhanced physical abilities. He has been shown to fight at heightened levels even when fatigued, a fact exemplified when Azrael was able to defeat Bane, despite suffering from both extreme exhaustion and Venom withdrawal.Azrael #39 He has also been shown to be able to resist an even more potent version of the Venom drug, having been able to break its vast addiction in only one night. Azrael is also a superior fighter; although he lacks technique and style in his fighting moves, he makes up for it with his inhuman speed, reflexes, and agility. Azrael has been able to match Deathstroke in a sword duel and has even defeated Batman in hand-to-hand combat.Azrael #99 This is not only due to his martial arts skills, but also due to his inhuman physical abilities. Equipment The original Azrael costume worn by Jean-Paul Valley consists of red and gold armor. After becoming an \\"Agent of the Bat\\", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest. Later on, he dons red armor with golden gauntlets, boots, shoulder pads and a blue cape. He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume that can be charged with thermal energy to increase their destructive power. In Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight, Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections of the changes in Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man. The gauntlets were taken by Kate Spencer, the current Manhunter, and are used in her outfit. The New 52 version of Jean-Paul wears a similar costume, and his weapon is a flaming knight sword called Murasame. He also possesses the familiar gauntlet blades as well. Other versions * Jean-Paul Valley appears Sean Murphy's Batman: Curse of the White Knight as the main antagonist. In the story he is a former United States Army veteran who has being diagnosed with terminal cancer, whom the Joker who claims that God has a mission for him. He then recruited two of his former squad mates and were hired by Ruth, a woman who served Gotham's Elites. When their backing he went on a rampage through Gotham City and murdered both James Gordon and Batman's entire Rogue Gallery. * The one-shot \\"Dark Multiverse: Knightfall\\" depicts a world where Jean Paul as Batman defeats Bruce Wayne, kills Gotham's villains, and keeps Bruce Wayne alive as a head and torso in Wayne Tower linked to a life support system, constantly visiting him to receive his approval of Valley's methods with Valley's regime lasting for thirty years. Bane's son and Lady Shiva rescue Wayne, providing him with a new nanotech body. Wayne kills his former successor, revealing that his years of isolation and torment have driven him to a point where he concludes that he can only rely on himself, then kills Shiva and strings Azrael up on a bat- sigil in the style of a crucifixion. * Jean-Paul Valley makes his DC Animated Universe debut on Batman: The Adventures Continue #7, a continuation of Batman: The Animated Series. While chasing Catwoman, Batman encounters Azrael. Azrael is in Gotham to retrieve the Shawl of Magdalene, which was stolen from his religious order, the Order of Saint Dumas. He joins forces with the Dark Knight in order to retrieve it.

During the first quarter of the twentieth century, he was one of the few New Zealand artists to engage with new ideas while staying in New Zealand. At this time most adventurous New Zealand painters, such as Frances Hodgkins, went overseas. He has sometimes been described as a Vasari - a recorder of artists and their doings - based upon his published recollections, which are the only first hand published account of that milieu. O'Keeffe was born in Sandhurst, Victoria, Australia in 1858. By c.1865 he and his family had moved to Dunedin. O'Keeffe studied at the Dunedin School of Art c.1881-86 and later at the Acad√©mie Julian teara.govt.n in Paris in 1894‚Äì1895. He started exhibiting at the Otago Art Society in 1886 and also exhibited with the Canterbury Society of Arts, the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, the Auckland Society of Arts, South Canterbury Arts Society and the Wanganui Society of Arts and Crafts. The demands of providing for his wife and six children meant O'Keeffe could not always afford to work as a full-time artist. Before going to Paris he managed the Liverpool Arms Hotel in Dunedin. After his return, from 1896 to 1905, he ran the Outram Hotel. He also supplemented his income by teaching art. While living at Outram he took private classes in Dunedin, walking the 14 miles between. He taught at the Dunedin School of Art from 1912 until its temporary closure in 1920. In the early 1920s he taught at the 'Barn Studio' with Mabel Hill. Her 1913 portrait of O'Keeffe is now in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Four of O'Keeffe's six children predeceased him. His two sons Lawrence and Victor were both killed in 1915 at Gallipoli. This experience is commemorated in his best known painting The Defence Minister's Telegram (1921, Dunedin Public Art Gallery), which shows an elderly man receiving news of his son's death. One of his daughters died in 1917 and another in 1939. O'Keeffe's finest paintings date from the 1920s and 1930s, however, most critical attention has concentrated on works painted in the first decade of the 20th century, notably Roses and Arum Lilies of 1906, now in the Auckland Art Gallery, and The Model at Rest of the same year, in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. His range of subject matter encompassed genre scenes, portraiture, landscapes (especially seascapes) and still life. His work is represented in the Auckland Art Gallery; Fletcher Collection, Auckland; Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington; Sarjeant Gallery, Wanganui; Christchurch Art Gallery; Aigantighe Art Museum, Timaru; Dunedin Public Art Gallery; Hocken Collections, University of Otago, Dunedin; and Anderson Park Art Gallery, Invercargill. O'Keeffe is the focus of the exhibition A. H. O'Keeffe: Light in the Shadows, at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery from 29 September until 9 December 2012, the first solo exhibition of his works since 1957.

Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983), was a U.S. Supreme Court case dealing with issues involving the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the case establishes a firm line in cases where police conduct search and seizure without a warrant. The court ruled that, while it is legal for authorities to target and approach a person based on their behavior, absent more, they cannot detain or search such individual without a warrant. Background In January 1978, two undercover officers approached the plaintiff, Mr. Royer, at the Miami International Airport because he fit a drug courier profile: He was a casually dressed, nervous young man carrying heavy luggage. Also, he paid cash for his ticket and filled out his baggage tag only with a name and destination. The officers identified themselves and asked if he would speak with them. He consented and, at their request, produced his airline ticket and his driver's license. He became visibly nervous when the officers noted that the ticket and driver's license bore different names, and then they told him they suspected him of transporting narcotics. Without returning his ticket or license, they asked him to accompany them to a small room off the concourse. He said nothing in response but went with them. Without his consent, they retrieved his luggage and brought it to the room. When asked if he would consent to a search of his suitcases, again he did not speak, but handed the officers a key. When the officers opened the suitcase, they discovered it contained marijuana. Decision The Supreme Court held that, although the officers correctly approached Mr. Royer in the airport, they moved him without his consent to the small room and held him there without probable cause. Therefore, his consent to search the suitcase resulted from an illegal custody and the marijuana discovered could not be admitted into evidence. The officers should not have asked the suspect to accompany them from the point of the initial consensual encounter to the small room until they returned his ticket and license. There was nothing to indicate the officers had any concern for their safety, or any legitimate need related to the limited purpose of the initial Terry stop. The court makes its decision about custody/non-custody based on everything police say or do--the totality of circumstances test. The officers also told him they suspected him of transporting narcotics, and then confined him in a small, enclosed room. If that were not enough, they retrieved his luggage without his consent. Thus, the Court held that a reasonable man would believe he was either under arrest, or in a custodial situation functionally equivalent to arrest. Since the officers only had reasonable suspicion, not probable cause to believe he was transporting narcotics until they opened the suitcase and found the marijuana (which they admitted in court), they had no legal right to place Mr. Royer in custody.

Early life and family His father, Luis Delgado, was a tailor and his mother, Lina Ramirez, was an actress, dancer and singer in the Teatro Musical de La Habana. When he was ten years old he entered the Amadeo Roldan Conservatory where he studied violoncello, an instrument that did not interest him. At twelve he left the conservatory, and pursued the study of sports and football. He later graduated in sport education. At 18, Isaac joined the group \\"Proyecto\\" at the request of the pianist, Gonzalo Rubalcaba. This sparked his innate love for music. It was at this point that he decided to study vocal technique with one of the best vocal instructors in Cuba, Mariana De Gonish. He also enrolled in the school for professional musicians, \\"Ignacio Cervantes\\". Professional life Issac Delgado began his professional career in 1983 when he joined Orquesta de Pacho Alonso. He travelled internationally with the orchestra and recorded a CD with them, his first commercial recording. In 1987 he became the vocalist for Galaxia, who also recorded a CD. NG la Banda and the birth of timba In 1988, Delgado became the lead vocalist for the group NG La Banda. It was with this group that he found fame. NG was the band that launched the timba revolution, the first new popular Cuban music genre in decades. As NG's lead vocalist, Delgado was at the cutting edge of Cuban dance music. His singing talents soon brought him to superstar status within the fast-growing timba field. Delgado became one of timba's best composers and a uniquely creative melodic improviser. In concert he often improvises words and melodies for periods of several minutes. He recorded three CDs with NG and was awarded the EGREM prize for 1990‚Äì1991. Solo career In 1991 Delgado put together his own band and recorded the CD, Dando La Hora under the artistic direction of Gonzalo Rubalcaba. This album received the 1992 EGREM Prize. His second CD, Con Ganas, again with Rubalcaba, received two EGREM prizes in 1993. In 1994 he received another EGREM award for his CD El chevere de la salsa y el caballero del son. His next album was El Ano Que Viene. He later travelled to the United States to perform in the Festival of Salsa in New York's Madison Square Garden with Celia Cruz, Jos√© Alberto \\"El Canario\\", and Grupo Niche. In New York he recorded another album, Otra Ideal. In 1997 he performed at the festival, Guerra de la Salsa with La India, Rey Ruiz, and Tony Vega. At this point in his career, Delgado was recording with both New York salsa musicians and Cuban timba musicians. Some of his recorded material sounds like salsa, but with distinctive timba elements periodically emerging to the surface. While some timba fans may have been disappointed hearing Delgado in a tamer and more polished salsa sound, the singer continued to record songs with leading timba musicians. Consequently, much of his post-NG material contains some of the most innovative instrumental accompaniment within the context of Cuban-style dance music. The overall sound of Delgado's recordings from this period sound far more like salsa than timba, However, little details in the arrangements reveal the handiwork of some of Cuba's most important innovators. Delgado's 1994 hit \\"La sandunguita\\" (composed by his bassist Alain P√©rez) took unprecedented liberties with clave, that are considered \\"sacrilegious\\" to old school musicians (Pe√±alosa 2012: 246). While such innovations further aggravated the salsa‚Äîtimba clave schism, there is no disagreement that \\"La sandunguita\\" swings. Delgado's most famous group (1996‚Äê1998) was with Alain P√©rez on bass and Iv√°n \\"Mel√≥n\\" Lewis on piano. Of particular note was the band's ability to spontaneously change the arrangement during performances. They were able to produce changes spontaneously by using flexible rhythm section schemes allowing them to alter the form of an arrangement to fit the flow of each performance (Moore 2012: 91). When the entire rhythm section of this band moved to Spain, Delgado added Antonio \\"Pach√°\\" Portuondo on timbales and Denis \\"Papacho\\" Sav√≥n on congas. He then convinced drummer Yoel P√°ez, bassist Joel Dom√≠nguez, and pianist Yaniel \\"El Maj√°\\" Matos to leave Paulito FG's band to join him. The following piano guajeo (or piano tumbao), created by Lewis is from \\"No me mires a los ojos.\\" It is a prime example of one of the most critical timba piano innovations‚Äîthe idea that the piano tumbao be a \\"hook\\" by which the song can be identified and that contributes greatly to the song's popularity. There are three places where the left hand adds an extra note between two right hand notes, a technique never used before in timba, which has become a major timba piano innovation. Mel√≥n was the first to use it as a central part of his style (Moore 2010 pt. 6.). Listen: \\"No me Mires a los ojos\\" by Issac Delgado. Lewis's piano guajeo on Delgado's \\"La tem√°tica\\" incorporates the technique of pattern displacement. A series of repeated octaves invoke a characteristic metric ambiguity (Moore 2010: pt. 4. 96-108). In 2006 Delgado went to the U.S. to work on a new album. In May 2007 he released En Primera Plana. He followed up with an album entitled, As√≠ Soy in October 2008. In 2011, Delgado released a maxi-single with La India in four different versions titled, \\"Que No Se Te Olvide.\\" Issac latest recording is \\"Lluvia y Fuego\\" (2019/Egrem) and features new original classics as well as tributes to Benny Mor√© and Cheo Feliciano.

It acts as a metabolic prodrug for THC itself, and chemically works the same way that heroin does as a metabolic prodrug for morphine. It has been reported to be approximately two times as potent as THC to approximately three times as potent as THC with a unique psychedelic high described as follows. Physical data, chemistry & properties THC acetate ester can reportedly be synthesized from THC or from THCA. The acetylation of THC does not change the properties of the compound to the same extent as with other acetate esters (e.g. morphine vs heroin), as the parent compound (THC) is already highly lipophilic, but potency is nonetheless increased to some extent. This derivative of THC is notable in that it is one of the few analogues of THC to have been encountered as a recreational drug sold and used in a highly pure smokable form. History THC acetate ester was investigated as a possible non-lethal incapacitating agent as part of the Edgewood Arsenal experiments at some point between 1949 and 1975. It was noted to have about twice the capacity to produce ataxia (lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements) as did THC when administered to dogs. Author D. Gold provided synthesis instructions for this compound (calling it \\"THC acetate\\") in his 1974 book Cannabis Alchemy: Art of Modern Hashmaking. The U.S. DEA first encountered THC-O-acetate as an apparent controlled substance analogue of THC in 1978. It was apparently made in an analogous manner to how heroin is made from morphine.Donald A. Cooper. Future Synthetic Drugs of Abuse. Drug Enforcement Administration, McLean, Virginia The incident was described by Donald A. Cooper of the DEA thus: A similar case was reported in June 1995 in the United Kingdom, and THC-O- acetate was ruled to be a Class A drug in that case. The description of that case appears to indicate the convicted manufacturer was using D. Gold's book Cannabis Alchemy as a guide.

Full-time students can claim loans for both fees and living costs while part-time students can only claim training institution fees. A non-refundable means-tested student allowance for living expenses can be claimed by students who are over 24 years old or whose parents have a low income. This criterion has caused anger among student bodies who point out that it excludes many self-sufficient adults from help due to parental income levels, and also that by age 24 most people have completed tertiary education. Loan composition The student loan comprises three parts: *Compulsory fees ‚Äì covers tuition fees and various levies. These are paid to the tertiary institution directly. *Course-related costs ‚Äì covers stationery, textbooks, equipment, etc. and voluntary student association fees. The borrower is allowed up to $1000 per year in course-related fees, which they can claim over the year. These are paid into the borrower's bank account. *Living costs ‚Äì covers rent, food, services, etc. The maximum payment for living costs is $239.76 per week, plus any student allowance received. This figure is adjusted every year in April to account for inflation. New loans There is a debt eligibility check for new loan applications. It is not possible to borrow through the Student Loan Scheme if you have $500 or more in default at the time of your application, and at least some portion of that amount has been overdue for a year or more. This applies to all new student loan applications received by StudyLink on or after 7 February 2013 and includes all unpaid repayment obligations, late payment interest, penalties and amounts under installment arrangement. Repayment While the borrower is a resident of New Zealand, loans are repaid at a rate of 12 cents for every whole dollar of taxable income earned over the repayment threshold of $19,448 per annum ($374 per week), and no interest is charged. Loan recipients who leave New Zealand accumulate interest after 184 days (about 6 months) abroad, and are assessed on their loan balance for repayment purposes, with a minimum annual payment being required. Loan repayments can be suspended on request for those on no/low income overseas, however interest still accumulates. For borrowers in New Zealand with more than one job, it is possible to apply for a student loan special deduction rate for secondary earnings if you earn less than the pay period repayment threshold from your main job. Student loans are written off in the event of the borrower dying; their estate is only obliged to pay any outstanding loan repayments up to the date of the borrower's death. History The loan system has been changed and modified significantly since its inception in 1992. Initially it provided bulk payments to students and charged lower than market interest rates from initial drawdown. This led some students to use this money for investment purposes, benefiting them but leading to a widespread perception of student excesses. Changes under the Labour Government In 2001 a growing debt mountain caused the Fifth Labour Government to stop interest payments while students studied. Then in 2005 they rode to election on the promise of stopping interest for all those remaining in New Zealand. From 2001, all full-time students were made exempt from interest while studying, and from 2006 all borrowers resident in New Zealand have been exempted from interest. (Technically interest is applied to all loans, but written off if the borrower is resident in New Zealand.) On 22 March 2007, the Government introduced a three-year 'loan repayment holiday' for those overseas. In practice this is a uniform extension of the previous ability to waive repayments until a later date. As before, interest accumulates during this period. Changes under the National Government The National Party initially opposed the interest free loans policy, but after it lost the 2005 election, in early 2008 said it would keep interest off student loans. After it was elected to government in the 2008 general election, the Fifth National Government has kept interest off student loans, but has introduced a number of changes designed to make students repay their loans faster, and introduced penalties for loan defaulters. From 1 April 2009, voluntary student loan repayments above $500 in a tax year were awarded at 10% bonus. In an effort to increase the repayment rate of borrowers, information sharing between Government departments was introduced in 2010. From 1 April 2012, the maximum time for a repayment holiday was reduced from 3 years to 1 year. From 1 April 2012, access to student loans was cut for people over 55. From 1 April 2013, the repayment rate for student loan deductions increased from 10% to 12% and the voluntary repayment bonus was abolished. (Student allowances were also restricted to four years worth of study.) The changes which came into effect in 2013 were introduced because the Government said it wanted to shift its investment from student support to supporting universities. Changes also raised the minimum mandatory repayments for people earning more than $367 a week. The University Students Association criticised the changes, saying people choosing to pay back loans quickly would no longer be rewarded, and repayment thresholds were too low, at about 34 % below the median weekly income. The changes were criticised by Labour Party Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Grant Robertson, who said they would \\"dampen demand\\" for tertiary education and drive graduates overseas. In 2013, the Government announced that the student loan defaulters could be arrested at New Zealand's border. It was an effort to recover $430 million of defaulted student loan debt, \\"80 per cent of which is owed by overseas borrowers\\". The move was criticised by NZUSA, who said the policy would be ineffectual, and could potentially create \\"student loan refugees\\" . Student debt levels Average student loan balances have increased substantially over time. For instance, a 2007 survey by the New Zealand Union of Students' Associations found that the average student debt was over NZ$28,000, up 54% from 2004.Student debt reaches $10b ‚Äì a millstone, not a milestone, NZUSA press release, 9 April 2008. (For comparison, the average annual income (before tax) of New Zealanders aged 15 or more was nearly NZ$35,000.)New Zealand Income Survey: June 2007 quarter - tables , Statistics New Zealand, 4 October 2007 The total student debt reached $5 billion in 2002 and then $10 billion in 2008, and has been growing by approximately $1 billion annually. As of December 2014 student loan debt was $14.2 billion. While student debt has increased, the number of students enrolled in tertiary education has generally declined in recent years. In January 2017 it was estimated 731,800 people, with an average balance of $21,000 had outstanding student loans representing a total of $15.3 billion.

History In 1785, a fur trading post was built at Battleford. The Dominion government acquired the North-West the Hudson's Bay Company in 1870, and in 1873, created the North-West Mounted Police to maintain law and order. In 1876 Fort Battleford was established, a North-West Mounted Police post.History of the Battlefords - Historic Perspective URL accessed April 25, 2007 Shortly thereafter, in 1877 the capital of the North West Territories moved from Fort Pitt to Battleford. In 1883 the capital of the North West Territories moved again, this time to Regina. In 1886 the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories with five puisne judges was established and resided in Regina. The original Provincial Regina Supreme Court House was constructed in 1895 and replaced in 1965. Saskatchewan became a province in 1905. The Judicature Act, 1907, established the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan. The Battleford Court House was designed by the architectural firm of Storey and Van Egmond, and constructed in 1907, marking the end of the old territorial court system. The Canadian Northern Railway was built north of the North Saskatchewan River creating a rapidly growing community of North Battleford. Battleford was no longer the capital of the NWT, nor centre of law and order through the post at Fort Battleford. Battleford Court House is still the oldest court house in Saskatchewan and received Provincial Heritage Property status in 1978. The court house still has sittings of the Court of Queen's Bench. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1981. Saskatchewan Provincial Archives keeps the historical records of court proceedings.

He was the great-grandfather of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899‚Äì1986), who commemorated him in three poems: *\\"Sepulchral Inscription\\" from Fervor of Buenos Aires (1923) *\\"A Page to Commemorate Colonel Su√°rez, Victor at Jun√≠n\\" from The Other, The Same (1964) *\\"Colonel Su√°rez\\" from The Iron Coin (1976) Role in the Battle of Jun√≠n On August 6, 1824, the revolutionary and royalist armies confronted one another on the plain of Jun√≠n. The revolutionaries occupied the low ground, while the royalist cavalry held better territory. The armies clashed at around four in the afternoon. In the initial melee of \\"swords and sabers\\", revolutionary general William Miller's hussars were forced back. This initial setback led Sim√≥n Bol√≠var to withdraw from the field to his infantry rearguard. Reunited, they hurried back and waited once more for the royalist cavalry under Canterac. Colonel Su√°rez commanded the Peruvian Hussars, part of Miller's cavalry. Su√°rez and his men concealed themselves in a twist in the road, where they lay in wait for the enemy. They did not leave with the rest of Miller's cavalry, observing that Canterac's entire cavalry was riding in pursuit. Su√°rez allowed them to pass and then ordered the attack. The royalists found their unguarded flank under attack. The royalists attempted to regroup and return the attack, but began to break rank and were pursued and defeated by the Peruvian Hussars, the Colombian Grenadiers, the Mounted Grenadiers, and Colombian Hussars.

L√•nekassen provides both loans and grants. Loans are issued to students following studies at Norwegian universities and colleges. Qualified applicants studying abroad outside the Nordic region can also receive loan and grant support from L√•nekassen. The status of a grant is conditional on passing all exams every semester. Portions of student loans can be converted into additional grant funding if the student achieves a high grade point average for the semester. Loan and grant funding levels by L√•nekassen are calculated using multiple variables including (but not limited to) tuition costs, income status, and whether or not the applicant is living with parents or other hosts rent-free.  Interest Rates  No interest is paid on Norwegian student loans until graduation or an interruption of the education. As of 2016, borrowers can sign an agreement for a fixed interest rate. Absent this, the interest rate is variable, calculated by the Ministry of Finance as the government's expected borrowing costs in the same interest period plus a 1.25% premium added to the effective annual interest rate.  Repayment Structure  Repayments on Norwegian student loans - either in the form of interest or principal - do not begin until graduation or interruption of studies. Repayment is structured in the form of amortization, with interest and principal combined into a fixed monthly payment (like an annuity). Fixed interest rate loans have repayment periods of 3, 5, or 10 years from the time that the loan becomes interest-bearing. The longest repayment term is 20 years, but can be deferred up to 30 years. After graduation, students are given a default grace period of 5 months before they have to begin making payments in the sixth month. Borrowers can request additional deferment periods for a maximum deferment of 3 years. The accrued interest from the deferment period will be capitalized into the loan, meaning that the standard monthly payment will increase for every additional deferment period. There are certain applicable exemptions for payment of interest, including (but not limited to) military service such as a student attending a military academy, civil service, care work, and welfare and poverty-based exemptions.  Key Figures  * L√•nekassen's lending portfolio is ca. NOK (Norwegian Kroner) 164 billion. * As of December 31st, 2016, L√•nekassen had 1,058,700 customers of which 653,800 are repaying their loans. * 422,500 upper education students and high school pupils applied for financial support for the academic year 2015 - 2016. * The average loan after graduation (higher education) in Norway was ca. NOK 280,000 in 2016. * In the academic year 2015 - 2016, NOK 3.7 billion in grants and NOK 22.7 billion in loans were allocated to students and pupils.

A new township, Bandar Baru Selayang is sited just 2 km away and was named after the town, where Majlis Perbandaran Selayang (MPS, English: Selayang Municipal Council) is located. Location Selayang is located on the main route to Rawang through Jalan Ipoh, and this route is connected to Jalan Kuching as main Rawang-Kuala Lumpur route. It is also an optional getaway to Damansara by passing Kepong via Kepong-Selayang Highway, which is a neighbouring town to the southwest. A route connecting Selayang and Gombak in the east is Jalan Batu Caves, which is annually closed during the Thaipusam celebration. Local government Most of Selayang is administered by Majlis Perbandaran Selayang (MPS). Part of the town that spills over into the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur is administered by Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL, English: Kuala Lumpur City Hall). The postcode for Selayang is 68100 Batu Caves, including the part of the town located in the federal territory, as postcode areas do not necessarily correspond to state borders. However, to minimise confusion, the postcode for the federal territory part is often written as 68100 Kuala Lumpur. Infrastructure Among facilities and infrastructures accessible is bus transportation provided by RapidKL and Metrobus, Batu Caves Komuter station which was formerly the old Batu Caves railway, Stadium, the MPS Sri Siantan Sports Center (locating the public swimming pool, locally known as Kompleks Sukan Sri Siantan), hospital, public library, public university and access to the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2). Development Currently, Selayang is undergoing moderate yet rapid development, notably real properties for residential and commercial. Local Attractions Alongside developments, Selayang hosts a number of attractions. Located in the northern portions of Klang Valley, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Selayang serves as a getaway spot from the bustle of the metropolis that is Kuala Lumpur. Popular landmarks include the Selayang Mall and Selayang Capitol (shopping complexes), Hospital Selayang, Selayang Mara University of Technology (UiTM Selayang), Majlis Perbandaran Selayang Stadium, and Pasar Borong Selayang. NatureFRIM= Given its varied topography pattern and close proximity to the Titiwangsa Mountains (Banjaran Titiwangsa), Selayang is a mix of urban and countryside sceneries. Its premier natural attraction, which is well-known across the country, is the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM), also known as FRIM Kepong. As a leading institute in tropical forestry research, it administers the sustainable management of the forest for the purpose of preservation and research. The institute dates back to 1926. This forest reserve area covers part of Kepong, Selayang (Bukit Lagong) and Rawang (Templer). Home for numerous species of flora and fauna. FRIM also functions as educational and recreational destination well equipped with infrastructures such as laboratory, information centre, sport facilities, a waterfall, river, trekking route, canopy walk, etc. The species are highly protected and visitors could see tags attached to trees displaying the names as well as quite rare animals on ground. =Bukit Lagong= Bukit Lagong which is the name of the hill covered by FRIM on the northern part is a recreational area in Selayang, storing recreational entertainment for visitors. Fresh water river, jungle trekking, kayaking and camping are among the attractions popular among the locals. Officiated in 2005 by the state's Minister, the Pusat Latihan Belia Bukit Lagong (Bukit Lagong Youth Training Center) opened for school and college outdoor programs, team-building, camping and various other recreational activities, mainly aims toward the development of youth. Alongside the crooked small route reaching towards the camp is a river that flows to Sungai Gombak, carrying fresh water from the hill. =Taman Rimba Komanwel= Another natural recreational escapade similar to Bukit Lagong is Taman Rimba Komanwel (Commonwealth Forest Park and Resort), located at KM43 on the farther north close to Rawang-Selayang border, in Lagong forest reserve. It is only accessible by using the Rawang-Kuala Lumpur Jalan Ipoh route, about 40 minutes ride from Kuala Lumpur. Taman Rimba Komanwel is more attributed to Rawang town rather than Selayang, though it is closer to Selayang in distance. =Selayang Hot Spring= Selayang Hot Spring or Kolam Air Panas Selayang is a very popular place among locals, which was discovered almost four decades ago and rumoured to have cured visitors with illnesses and deceases, such as diabetes, gout, skin illnesses and many more. Though the truth of such claims remain uncertain, numerous testimonies have been received by visitors. There are even visitors who spend time here two or three days in a week, or almost everyday after work. One possible explanation could probably be the algae microorganisms living in the springs, but so far there is no proven scientific evidence that conclusively confirm or refute the claims. Nevertheless, the hot spring spot is certainly a destination for city dwellers who seek relaxation and tranquility, far cheaper than going to a spa. Most of the natural places of attraction is Selayang are in the north, attached to the greenery environment. Other placesBandar Baru Selayang= Bandar Baru Selayang or colloquially known as BBS among locals is a rather new township. It was opened in 1987. It places the municipal council's headquarters and other important landmarks including the MPS Stadium known among local football enthusiasts as among other venues for important matches in the country's popular football leagues. Many restaurants are located near the stadium. The town becomes very lively when there are games played in the MPS Stadiums the stadium's spot lights illumination pour the surrounding area with bright beam. The town's pasar malam (night market) opens every Thursday evening and is located behind the stadium where it sells food, clothes and merchandises. BBS is constantly maintained by MPS to preserve the town's landscape and cleaniness. =Pasar Borong Selayang= Known among households and wholesale traders within and out from Selayang, Pasar Borong Selayang (Selayang wholesale market) is one of the busiest place attracting people to purchase wet products at cheap prices. The two large hangar-like facility is located by the road side of Jalan Ipoh near the border between Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. It is an active and hectic trading market, selling fishery, agriculture and poultry products and at usually its peak preceding festive seasons during which households purchase more goods for celebration preparation. Despite the increasing competition with newly established low price markets such as Tesco and NSK Trade City, Pasar Borong Selayang continue to survive and generally still is the default market choice. Open daily as early as 3 am, the market attracts buyers even far from outer Selayang, including Kuala Lumpur and Rawang. =Batu Dam= Another recreational destination, Ulu Yam, places series of rivers and waterfalls at several points along the Ulu Yam road. Ulu Yam town is located at the north east neighbouring Batang Kali, and drivers would first pass by the Batu Dam, a water supply dam cum family recreation location, well known by the locals. Among recreational sport available in Empangan Batu is paragliding and kayaking and visitors spend their evening by jogging, playing kite or simply cooling down with families and colleagues.

Anointing of the Sick is a sacrament of the Catholic Church that is administered to a Catholic \\"who, having reached the age of reason, begins to be in danger due to sickness or old age\\", except in the case of those who \\"persevere obstinately in manifest grave sin\\". Proximate danger of death, the occasion for the administration of Viaticum, is not required, but only the onset of a medical condition of serious illness or injury or simply old age: \\"It is not a sacrament for those only who are at the point of death. Hence, as soon as anyone of the faithful begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age, the fitting time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly already arrived.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1512 Despite that position, anointing of the sick has in practice often been postponed until someone is on the point of dying, so much so that, in spite of the fact that, in all celebrations of this sacrament, the liturgy prays for recovery of the health of the sick person if that would be conducive to his salvation. In the past it became increasingly administered only to the dying and so came to be called Extreme Unction (Final Anointing). The sacrament is administered by a bishop or priest, who uses oleum infirmorum/Oil of the Sick (olive oil or another pure plant oil blessed by a bishop) to anoint the patient's forehead and perhaps other parts of the body while reciting certain prayers. It gives comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins. Several other churches and ecclesial communities have similar ceremonies (see Anointing of the Sick for a more general discussion).  Introduction=Sacramental graces The Catholic Church sees the effects of the sacrament as follows: As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death; it prevents the believer from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation. Because one of the effects of the sacrament is to absolve the recipient of any sins not previously absolved through the sacrament of penance, only an ordained priest or bishop may administer the sacrament. \\"The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects: *the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole Church; *the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age; *the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of penance; *the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul; *the preparation for passing over to eternal life.\\" An extensive account of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Anointing of the Sick is given in Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1499‚Äì1532. Biblical references The chief Biblical text concerning anointing of the sick is : \\"Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.\\" , and are also quoted in this regard. Names for the sacrament In the past, the usual name of the sacrament in official documents of the Catholic Church was Extreme Unction (meaning final anointing), a name attached to it when it was administered only to those on the point of death. Peter Lombard (died 1160) is the first writer known to have used the term,Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article \\"unction\\" which did not become the usual name in the West till towards the end of the twelfth century, and never became current in the East.Catholic Encyclopedia (1913): article \\"Extreme Unction\\" The word \\"extreme\\" (final) indicated either that it was the last of the sacramental unctions (after the anointings at Baptism, Confirmation and, if received, Holy Orders) or because at that time it was normally administered only when a patient was in extremis (at the point of death). In the early 1970s the official name was changed to Anointing of the Sick to reflect Church teaching that the sacrament is to be conferred on those who are \\"dangerously ill\\".[.https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3J.HTM canon 997] of the Code of Canon Law; cf. apostolic constitution Sacram Unctionem Infirmorum of 30 November 1972; and Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1512-1513 \\"Extreme Unction\\" continues in popular use among those who prefer to keep the terminology that was customary in the period immediately before the Second Vatican Council (see Traditionalist Catholic). The sacrament has also been known by various other names in Western Christianity throughout the years, including: the holy oil or unction of the sick; the unction or blessing of consecrated oil; the unction of God; the office of the unction. In the Eastern Church it is technically known as euchelaion (i.e., prayer-oil); other names used include: elaion hagion (holy oil), hegismenon elaion (consecrated oil), elaiou chrisis (anointing with oil), chrisma (anointing). Administration Catholic canon law indicates who may receive the sacrament: \\"The anointing of the sick can be administered to a member of the faithful who, having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger due to sickness or old age.\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 1004 If a new illness develops or the first illness relapses or worsens, the patient may receive the sacrament a further time. A priest may, on the basis of his pastoral judgment, administer the sacrament numerous times in cases of old age or chronic illness.Rite of Anointing of the Sick, 102 Like any sacrament, anointing of the sick can be given only to someone who is alive; however, as the precise moment of death is not known or defined with precision, someone may be anointed conditionally (\\"if you are alive\\" prefixed to the sacramental formula) during a brief period after being declared clinically dead. The sacrament of anointing can be administered to an individual whether at home, in a hospital or institution, or in church. Several sick persons may be anointed within the rite, especially if the celebration takes place in a church or hospital. The celebration may also take place during a Catholic Mass. Relationship with the \\"last rites\\" When administered to those on the point of death, the sacraments of Penance, Anointing of the Sick and Viaticum (Holy Communion administered to someone who is dying) are sometimes called the last rites. What in the judgment of the Catholic Church are properly described as the last rites are Viaticum, and the ritual prayers of Commendation of the Dying, and Prayers for the Dead.M. Francis Mannion, \\"Anointing or last rites?\\" in Our Sunday Visitor Newsweekly The normal order of administration of these three sacraments to the dying is: first Reconciliation (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, absolution is given conditionally on the existence of contrition), then Anointing, then Viaticum. Only a priest or bishop can administer the sacraments of Reconciliation and Anointing of the Sick, but a lay person may give a dying person Holy Communion as \\"Viaticum, the Last Sacrament of the Christian\\". Established form The oil used in the sacrament is usually olive oil, though other oils may also be used. It is blessed by the bishop of the diocese at the Chrism Mass he celebrates on Holy Thursday or on a day close to it. In case of necessity, the priest administering the sacrament may bless the oil within the framework of the celebration. In the Roman Rite of the Latin Church, the priest anoints the sick person's forehead and hands with oil (usually in the form of a cross), saying: \\"Through this holy anointing, may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up.\\" He may also, in accordance with local culture and traditions, and the needs of the sick person, anoint other parts of the body, but without repeating the sacramental formula. This is the form established for the Roman Rite through the papal document Sacram unctionem infirmorum of 1972. The form used in the Roman Rite in the preceding period included anointing of seven parts of the body (though that of the loins was generally omitted in English-speaking countries), while saying (in Latin): \\"Through this holy anointing, may the Lord pardon you whatever sins/faults you have committed by... .\\" The sense in question was then mentioned: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, walking, carnal delectation.Extreme Unction, \\"Actual rite of administration\\". Old Catholic Encyclopedia. <> Eastern Catholic churches In the Eastern Catholic churches, the sacrament (or \\"sacred mystery\\") of Anointing the Sick is administered using various liturgies often identical with forms used by non- Catholic Eastern churches. Adaptation or development of the liturgical forms used in the Eastern Catholic churches is overseen by the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, part of the Roman Curia.

In 1930 he entered the University of California, Berkeley, to study anthropology. While there he met photographer Willard Van Dyke after writing an assignment about his photographs. Van Dyke introduced him to Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham and other photographers around the San Francisco area, and he soon was photographing in a style similar to theirs. In 1932 Holder was present at a gathering at Van Dyke's house in Berkeley in which this group discussed their intention to unite in promotion of their artistic vision, They were searching for a name for their small group, and Holder suggested \\"US 256\\", which was then the commonly used Uniform System designation for a very small aperture stop on a camera lens. Adams thought the name would be confusing to the public, and he suggested \\"f/64\\", which was a corresponding aperture setting for the focal system that was gaining popularity.Brouwer, Kenneth. Pack of Wolfes From this discussion they formed the now famous Group f/64. Later that year Holder participated in their first Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, showing four prints. While photographing part-time, Holder continued his education at Berkeley and received his B.A. in 1935. There is almost nothing written about his photographic career after he graduated. By 1940 he seemed to have drifted away from his photography interests and dedicated himself to becoming a full-time archeologist. In 1951, he earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University.

Owned by Cumulus Media, WJRW is the Grand Rapids affiliate for CBS Sports Radio and Sean Baligian. The WJRW studios and transmitter both reside in Grand Rapids. In addition to a standard analog transmission, the station also simulcasts over low-power FM translator W291DJ (106.1 FM) and is available online. History On September 16, 1940, the station signed on under the WLAV call sign (which stood for Leonard Adrian Versluis, the station's original owner). It added WLAV-FM in 1947. WLAV became a full-time Top 40 music station in the summer of 1963, and was originally consulted by Mike Joseph, who later went on to develop the Hot Hits format in the late 1970s. One popular WLAV personality was Larry Adderley, who would later work as a sportscaster at various radio and TV stations in the Detroit media market as well as an announcer for the Detroit Tigers. WLAV soon overtook rival stations WGRD and WMAX as the dominant hit music station in Grand Rapids, but its market share declined in the 1970s with the popularity of FM stations such as WZZM, WGRD (which had added an FM simulcast outlet), and WLAV's own sister station WLAV-FM, which found success as an album rock station. \\"Music Radio WLAV\\" went to a more adult contemporary sound in 1974, which continued until 1980, when the station tried a talk radio format as the \\"1340 Townhouse,\\" featuring popular talk show hosts Lee Harris and Bob Kwesell. Call sign was WTWN. The heritage WLAV call letters were restored in 1984, and the station flipped to oldies, which lasted for the next eight years. Although WLAV was a modest success with oldies, it was hurt when WODJ debuted in 1989 as an FM oldies station with a stronger signal and swept the ratings. In 1993, the format changed to a modern rock-based sound called \\"1340 Underground.\\" This happened shortly after an experiment with changing the format to modern rock on WLAV-FM had failed. WLAV-FM then reverted to classic rock. The \\"1340 Underground\\" format gained a considerable cult following in the Grand Rapids area, even though the night-time signal was poor. The WBBL call letters and sports radio format debuted on May 25, 1994, when ownership of the radio station had changed. On May 28, 2009, WBBL began simulcasting its sports programming on 107.3 FM in Greenville, which became WBBL-FM. On July 27, 2009, the call sign on 1340 AM was changed to WJRW and the format was changed to talk radio on Tuesday, August 18, 2009. The WJRW call letters were chosen to remind listeners that the station is co-owned and would carry many of the same Westwood One shows that are heard on 50,000 watt Detroit station WJR. The extra \\"W\\" signifies the Grand Rapids station is in the Western part of Michigan. WBBL-FM continued airing sports. On January 8, 2011, the syndicated weekly \\"Kim Komando Show\\" switched to WJRW after airing for a decade on a competing station. Shortly thereafter, Komando's technology column began appearing in the Sunday edition of The Grand Rapids Press. On March 31, 2011, it was announced that local radio veteran Michelle McKormick would be joining WJRW as host of The Buzz with Michelle McKormick. Her show debuted on June 6, 2011. On January 4, 2019, the station switched to sports radio following the flip of co-owned WBBL-FM from sports to country music. WJRW now carries a couple of shows previously heard on WBBL-FM, as well as programming from the CBS Sports Radio Network.

The game is substantially the same as full rugby league, with some rule changes and shorter games. Sevens is usually played in festivals, as its shorter game play allows for a tournament to be completed in a day or over a single weekend. As well as being played by club sides, rugby league sevens is particularly popular with social teams, formed in the workplace or from the patrons of a public house for example, as it is often difficult in these places to form a full squad of 13 players and four substitutes of regular players. Some tournaments prefer to play rugby league nines (rugby league with nine players on each side) to distinguish it from rugby union sevens. History The game of rugby sevens dates back to its invention by Ned Haig in Melrose in the Scottish Borders in 1883, just over a decade before the schism in rugby football in 1895, which led to the creation of rugby league and rugby union. However, rugby sevens did not spread outside Scotland before the 1920s. That said, the larger part of Scotland's rugby league players have come from Borders backgrounds. The record rugby league sevens attendance remains the 80,000 that attended a 1933 match between Australia and England at Roundhay Park in Leeds. This match was also attended by English royalty. The first rugby league sevens tournament was played in Australia in 1961. The major tournament was the World Sevens played prior to the beginning of the National Rugby League season in Sydney, Australia. That tournament has been suspended but sevens is played around the world at different levels from junior teams to international ones. Sevens is considered to be a good tool to increase the skills of players and to help emerging rugby league nations. Playing area Sevens is played on a standard rugby league playing field as defined in Section 1 of the International Laws of the Game. Teams Teams are composed of three forwards, one half and three backs. Rules Sevens follows the rules of 13-a-side rugby league with exceptions. Each rugby league nation is at liberty to adopt a modified version of international rugby league rules for their own domestic competitions; as a result the rules of rugby league sevens can vary too, even before changes implemented by competition organisers. Matches have two halves of seven minutes. Unlimited substitutions are allowed from a squad totalling 12 players. In sevens, smaller scrums, formed from the three forwards on each team, are formed. All kicks for goal should be drop kicks in sevens. After points have been scored a tap kick restart is taken by the non-scoring side. The World Sevens, the world's premier sevens event while it operated, had two 7 minute halves up to and including the semi-finals with extra time played in the event of tie at the end normal time. The final was longer with two 10-minute halves. In 2004, the World Sevens tackle limit was reduced from 6 to 4.

The main difficulty is that they must be played forte and legato at speed, ascending and descending sequentially over the keyboard. Due to the obligation to sustain the left-hand melody somehow whilst still keeping the right hand's figure clear, this presents a great difficulty. The central section (bars 29‚Äì60) features elaborations on the original figuration. The D minor lasts only 7 bars before undergoing an extended series of modulations right through to bar 60 ‚Äì the return to the main theme.

WBFX is also an affiliate of the Western Michigan Broncos Radio Network. History The station first began broadcasting in 1962 as WMAX-FM, then became WYON as a sister station to WION in Ionia, Michigan in 1965. In 1976, the station was purchased by the owners of WCUZ 1230 and became WMLW (\\"Mellow 101\\"), a soft rock/adult contemporary station. WMLW switched to album oriented rock as WFFX \\"The Fox\\" in 1978, and then to country music in 1980 as WCUZ-FM ('CUZ-FM 101.3...more of the music you like... on CUZ-FM.\\" For most of the 1980s, country WCUZ was a market leader in Grand Rapids, but the station saw its market share erode after the 1992 debut of \\"B93,\\" WBCT-FM, on 93.7. By 1998, WCUZ was co-owned with its rival station, WBCT, under the umbrella of Clear Channel Communications, and had moved to a classic country format, identifying as \\"Country Gold WCUZ.\\" Clear Channel (which would become iHeartMedia in 2014) dropped the \\"Country Gold\\" format on September 24, 2000, and debuted classic rock \\"101.3 The Fox\\" that afternoon following coverage of the MBNA.com 400 NASCAR Winston Cup event. They changed call letters to the current WBFX on September 27, 2000. The lineup at the debut was Bob and Tom (with Big Richard), Ranger Bob, Aris Hampers and Otto Mation and Alison Harte. Others jocks over the decade would include Matt Hendricks (AKA Big Richard), Jack Lawson, Mark Fuerie, Andy O'Riley, Shafee and Joe Daugherty. The station also featured Nights With Alice Cooper for several years in the evenings. Since its inception, WBFX has changed its music style multiple times, although all remained loosely in the classic rock genre. In late June 2009, the station adjusted its format towards mainstream rock, with a mix of harder classic rock songs as well as recent rock music from the 1990s and 2000s. This adjustment was in response to the local active rock station WKLQ changing formats to sports talk. By 2010, however, Townsquare Media's WGRD-FM adjusted its format to active rock from alternative rock, and saw a decent rise in the ratings, while WBFX remained roughly the same. After this, WBFX rebranded as \\"The Next Generation of Classic Rock\\", and adjusted their playlist back towards having a more traditional classic rock feel, taking on WLAV-FM. On February 20, 2013, WBFX began running liners advising listeners that \\"The Fox dies Friday\\". At Noon the next day, after playing \\"The Breakup Song\\" by the Greg Kihn Band and \\"The Final Countdown\\" by Europe, the station rebranded as \\"101.3 The Brew\\", with an acknowledgement of Grand Rapids being voted as 2012's \\"Beer City USA\\" according to a poll conducted on Examiner.com and the noteworthy rise of the popularity and economic impact of microbreweries in the region. The station launched with \\"Enter Sandman\\" by Metallica. Musically, the station was tweaked with more rock titles from the 1980s and 1990s added into the playlist. The presentation and formatics are similar to other stations called \\"The Brew\\" that Clear Channel has deployed in places such as Portland, OR, Columbus, OH and Wichita, KS. With sister station WMAX-FM having taken the ESPN Radio affiliation in recent years, WBFX continues to air NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races, as they have for over a decade. On July 6, 2015, WBFX tweaked their format towards an active rock-leaning mainstream rock presentation. While titles going back to the 1960s were occasionally played, the emphasis was strongly on rock music of the 1990s and 2000s. The ratings slid heavily a few months after this prior tweak in the format. On February 16, 2016, WBFX shifted the format back to classic rock, with emphasis on 1970s and 1980s rock music. They also changed the lineup of announcers to prefer locally-based ones instead. On January 23, 2017, the station added the Rover's Morning Glory hot talk radio show during morning drive time. On March 21, 2019, the station tweaked the playlist once again, eliminating much of the pre-1980s rock music and adding many well-known 1990s rock songs.

Life Elias Cornelius' father was also named Elias Cornelius (1758‚Äì1823), and his mother was Rachel Stocker. His father had joined the American Revolutionary War as a surgeon after some rudimentary training, but was taken prisoner on 22 August 1777. Cornelius met Ethan Allen in prison, but escaped on 16 January 1778, and rejoined the Continental Army. Elias Cornelius was born 30 July 1794 in Somers, Westchester County, New York. At the age of sixteen, he began his college career at Yale College. After his undergraduate years, Cornelius continued to study theology at the Yale Divinity School under Timothy Dwight IV. He was licensed to preach on 4 June 1816 by the South Association of Congregational ministers, and appointed agent of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). As ABCFM agent Cornelius traveled to many cities and towns in the northeastern states including Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maryland, preaching sermons and raising money. The majority of the money raised was to support the conversion of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Creek Indian tribes to Christianity. It was also to be used to establish schools within these nations. Cornelius continued to preach and fundraise as he traveled south where he finally ended in Northwest Georgia, near Cartersville in 1817. He spent 18 months there and it was at this location that he encountered the Cherokee tribe who led him to the Etowah Indian Mounds. Cornelius wrote in his journal about his visit and the journal became the first published account of a white person visiting the mounds. Neither Cornelius nor the group of Cherokee who led him to the site knew the relevance or purpose of the mounds at that time. It was later discovered that the mounds were used as burial sites as well as residential areas and temples. In September 1818, Cornelius married Mary Hooker, daughter of Asabel Hooker (minister of Goshen, Connecticut), descendants of Thomas Hooker (1586‚Äì1647). Their children were: # Elias Cornelius III, born 13 August 1819, married Lydia Francis Gray, and died 7 December 1857. # Mary Hooker Cornelius, born 3 July 1821. # Thomas Hooker Cornelius, born 17 March 1823 and died 18 November 1853 in San Francisco. # Edward Hooker Cornelius, born 10 September 1825 and died 29 April 1864 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. # Sarah Edwards Cornelius, born 14 February 1830, married George B. Little in 1850, and had two daughters. # Jeremiah Evarts Cornelius, born 25 December 1831, married Sarah Fenner Storrs (daughter of William L.

This √©tude places huge demands on the performer in varying a single pattern by changes of accent and touch. Chopin's primary concern in this work is for the widest possible variety of touch that can be given to a single figuration, with the continuous changes of accent highlighting not only different parts of the figuration but also emphasizing the polyphonic nature of the pattern. The opening section (bars 1‚Äì16) sets forth the three basic variations with almost a constant legato bass line; off-beat with four accents per bar in the right hand against four in the left hand (bars 1‚Äì8); then on-beat but with six accents in the right hand against four in the left (bars 9‚Äì12); and finally both hands staccato with no accents. The central section (bars 17-54) develops the opening theme through a series of modulations (E major, D major, A major and E major) with the accents in the right hand either being on- or off-beat. This is likely designed primarily to test the skills learnt in the first section. The climax of the central section starts at bar 43 and at this point it is the left hand that is playing off-beat whilst the right hand maintains a strict four beats per bar. The piece modulates back to the tonic of A in bar 55. The final section (bars 55‚Äì77) is a reprise of the opening theme, but with several modulations embedded within the final bars, all underpinned by a dominant pedal point. The tonic appears only very briefly in this final section and is not fully reestablished until bar 69, which is effectively the coda.

It typically uses malonyl-CoA as a carbon source to elongate ACP-bound acyl species, resulting in the formation of ACP-bound Œ≤-ketoacyl species such as acetoacetyl-ACP. center Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase is a highly conserved enzyme that is found in almost all life on earth as a domain in fatty acid synthase (FAS). FAS exists in two types, aptly named type I and II. In animals, fungi, and lower eukaryotes, Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases make up one of the catalytic domains of larger multifunctional proteins (Type I), whereas in most prokaryotes as well as in plastids and mitochondria, Beta- ketoacyl-ACP synthases are separate protein chains that usually form dimers (Type II). Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, perhaps the most well known of this family of enzymes, catalyzes a Claisen condensation between acetyl CoA and malonyl ACP. The image below reveals how CoA fits in the active site as a substrate of synthase III. 300px Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II only catalyze acyl-ACP reactions with malonyl ACP. Synthases I and II are capable of producing long-chain acyl-ACPs. Both are efficient up to acyl-ACPs with a 14 carbon chain, at which point synthase II is the more efficient choice for further carbon additions. Type I FAS catalyzes all the reactions necessary to create palmitic acid, which is a necessary function in animals for metabolic processes, one of which includes the formation of sphingosines. Beta-ketoacyl- ACP synthase is found as a component of a number of enzymatic systems, including fatty acid synthetase (FAS); the multi-functional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from Penicillium patulum, which is involved in the biosynthesis of a polyketide antibiotic; polyketide antibiotic synthase enzyme systems; Emericella nidulans multifunctional protein Wa, which is involved in the biosynthesis of conidial green pigment; Rhizobium nodulation protein nodE, which probably acts as a beta-ketoacyl synthase in the synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain; and yeast mitochondrial protein CEM1.  Structure  Crystal structure of Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III from E.coli Beta-ketoacyl synthase contains two protein domains. The active site is located between the N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain contains most of the structures involved in dimer formation and also the active site cysteine. Residues from both domains contribute to substrate binding and catalysis In animals and in prokaryotes, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase is a domain on type I FAS, which is a large enzyme complex that has multiple domains to catalyze multiple different reactions. Analogously, beta-ketoacyl- ACP synthase in plants is found in type II FAS; note that synthases in plants have been documented to have a range of substrate specificities. The presence of similar ketoacyl synthases present in all living organisms point to a common ancestor. Further examination of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II of E. coli revealed that both are homodimeric, but synthase II is slightly larger. However, even though they are both involved in fatty acid metabolism, they also have highly divergent primary structure. In synthase II, each subunit consists of a five-stranded beta pleated sheet surrounded by multiple alpha helices, shown in the image on the left. The active sites are relatively close, only about 25 angstroms apart, and consist of a mostly hydrophobic pocket. Certain experiments have also suggested the presence of ‚Äúfatty acid transport tunnels‚Äù within the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase domain that lead to one of many ‚Äúfatty acid cavities‚Äù, which essentially acts as the active site.  Mechanism  Beta-ketoacyl-synthase‚Äôs mechanism is a topic of debate among chemists. Many agree that Cys171 of the active site attacks acetyl ACP's carbonyl, and, like most enzymes, stabilizes the intermediate with other residues in the active site. ACP is subsequently eliminated, and it deprotonates His311 in the process. A thioester is then regenerated with the cysteine in the active site. Decarboxylation of a malonyl CoA that is also in the active site initially creates an enolate, which is stabilized by His311 and His345. The enolate tautomerizes to a carbanion that attacks the thioester of the acetyl-enzyme complex. Some sources speculate that an activated water molecule also resides in the active site as a means of hydrating the released CO2 or of attacking C3 of malonyl CoA. Another proposed mechanism considers the creation of a tetrahedral transition state. The driving force of the reaction comes from the decarboxylation of malonyl ACP; the energy captured in that bond technically comes from ATP, which is what is initially used to carboxylate acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA. 500px  Biological function  The main function of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase is to produce fatty acids of various lengths for use by the organism. These uses include energy storage and creation of cell membranes. Fatty acids can also be used to synthesize prostaglandins, phospholipids, and vitamins, among many other things. Further, palmitic acid, which is created by the beta-ketoacyl-synthases on type I FAS, is used in a number of biological capacities. It is a precursor of both stearic and palmitoleic acids. Palmitoleic can subsequently be used to create a number of other fatty acids. Palmitic acid is also used to synthesize sphingosines, which play a role in cell membranes.  Clinical significance  The different types of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases in type II FAS are called FabB, FabF, and FabH synthases. FabH catalyzes the quintessential ketoacyl synthase reaction with malonyl ACP and acetyl CoA. FabB and FabF catalyze other related reactions. Given that their function is necessary for proper biological function surrounding lipoprotein, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide synthesis, they have become a target in antibacterial drug development. In order to adapt to their environment, bacteria alter the phospholipid composition of their membranes. Inhibiting this pathway may thus be a leverage point in disrupting bacterial proliferation. By studying Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic, pneumonic, and septicaemic plagues, researchers have shown that FabB, FabF, and FabH can theoretically all be inhibited by the same drug due to similarities in their binding sites. However, such a drug has not yet been developed. Cerulenin, a molecule that appears to inhibit by mimicking the ‚Äúcondensation transition state‚Äù can only inhibit B or F, but not H. Another molecule, thiolactomycin, which mimics malonyl ACP in the active site, can ony inhibit FabB. Lastly, platensimycin also has possible antibiotic use due to its inhibition of FabF. These types of drugs are highly relevant. For example, Y. pestis was the main agent in the Justinian Plague, Black Death, and the modern plague. Even within the last five years, China, Peru, and Madagascar all experienced an outbreak of infection by Y. pestis. If it is not treated within 24 hours, it normally results in death. Furthermore, there is worry that it can now be used as a possible biological warfare weapon. Unfortunately, many drugs that target prokaryotic beta-ketoacyl-synthases carry many side effects. Given the similarities between prokaryotic ketoacyl synthases and mitochondrial ones, these types of drugs tend to unintentionally also act upon mitochondrial synthases, leading to many biological consequences for humans.  Industrial applications  Recent efforts in bioengineering include engineering of FAS proteins, which includes beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase domains, in order to favor the synthesis of branched carbon chains as a renewable energy source. Branched carbon chains contain more energy and can be used in colder temperatures because of their lower freezing point. Using E. coli as the organism of choice, engineers have replaced the endogenous FabH domain on FAS, which favors unbranched chains, with FabH versions that favor branching due to their high substrate specificity for branched acyl-ACPs.

It is the first part of The Mediator series. Its alternative title is Love You To Death.  Plot summary  Sixteen-year-old Susannah 'Suze' Simon is a mediator, which means she can see and talk to ghosts. Suze spends a lot of time directing the usually unhappy dead to the afterlife. However, her job is not easy, as not all ghosts want to be guided. Every day, she is haunted by the fact that they will not leave her alone until she helps them resolve their unfinished business with the living. Suze, whose father died when she was six, moves from New York to Carmel, California after her mom's second marriage to Andy Ackerman, a carpenter. She gets three stepbrothers, Jake, Brad, and David, whom she nicknames Sleepy (a senior), Dopey (a sophomore like Suze), and Doc (a seventh grader). However, when Suze arrives at her new home, she finds a handsome, archaic ghost named Jesse de Silva sitting on her window seat. Irritated, she tells Jesse to move on or find some other house to haunt, as now she is living there, but he refuses. Suze hopes to start fresh in California, with trips to the beach instead of the cemetery and sunbathing instead of tending to lost souls. On her first day at the Junipero Serra Mission Academy, however, she is immediately faced with the angry ghost of Heather Chambers, the student whose place she took: Heather had committed suicide when her boyfriend Bryce Martinson broke up with her. Father Dominic, the school principal and a fellow mediator, is surprised to learn that Suze uses physical violence to subdue ghosts like Heather, and insists that she should use friendlier, more peaceful methods of mediation. Suze refuses, saying that she has done this job her whole life and is not going to change. When Heather's old friends - including Bryce - begin to show interest in Suze, Heather claims Suze is taking over the life she had, and ignores all attempts to placate her. One night, after Heather attempts to kill Bryce, Suze sneaks out to the Mission to try and talk her into moving on, but Heather misconstrues her meaning, harbouring the false hope that she might get her life back. When Suze tries to explain that this is not the case, Heather enters a rage and tries to use her ghostly powers to kill Suze, who narrowly escapes with the help of Jesse. The next day, Father Dom is unhappy with Suze's attempt to deal with Heather alone and the damage it has caused to the school grounds. She tries to explain that it was going to work, but that Heather's strength has reached unexpected levels. Several days later, Heather attempts to kill Bryce again, and is barely stopped by Father Dominic; both men are injured in the process. Furious, Suze returns to school that evening - ignoring Jesse's warnings - and performs a voodoo exorcism, successfully sending Heather to the afterlife. However, as she is exorcised, Heather causes the school breezeway to collapse on Suze, who is knocked unconscious and barely saved by Sleepy and Doc. The next day, Suze learns that she has been elected vice-president of the sophomore class, replacing Heather. Although Father Dom is glad that the ghost is gone, he remains unimpressed with Suze's mediation techniques. He also informs her that Bryce has transferred to another high school, much to her dismay, but reminds her that it is for his safety. In her spare time, Suze researches Jesse's past, and, with Doc's help, she discovers that Jesse died 150 years ago under mysterious circumstances on his way to marry his cousin Maria. Suze later talks to Jesse, and while they set out some ground rules regarding his presence, she remains confused about her feelings towards him.

He was elected a member of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas in 1990, and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2014. In 2019-2020 he served as the president of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas. He is also a member of The Context Group, the Society of Biblical Literature, and the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies. He was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Lethbridge (2011) and the University of Pretoria (2018) https://utoronto.academia.edu/JohnKloppenborg His work includes research on the origins of and sources for early Christian writings including the Q document, thought to have been one of the first written collections of the teachings of Jesus. Kloppenborg has also published on the importance of Graeco-Egyptian documentary papyri for understanding the parables and sayings of Jesus, and has worked extensively on Greek and Roman private associations and their bearing on understanding the dynamics of early Christ groups.  Biography  Kloppenborg received his M.A. (1977) and his Ph.D. (1984) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from the University of St. Michael's College (a constituent college of the University of Toronto). He has taught and conducted research in Toronto, Windsor, United Kingdom, Helsinki, Jerusalem, Cambridge, Calgary, and the United States in Claremont, California. He is one of the general editors of the International Q Project.  Contributions to Near East and Biblical Scholarship  John Kloppenborg is an original research scholar whose work on the origins of Christianity, early Christian documents and the history of Second Temple Judaism. He has researched and written most substantially about the Q document, also known as the Sayings Gospel Q. This document is thought to be one of the oldest circulating sources of the sayings of Jesus. It is thought to be prior to, and to have been known to the authors of The Gospel of Matthew, The Gospel of Luke, and is similar in some ways to the (non-synoptic) The Gospel of Thomas. He has also worked extensively on the Synoptic problem and co-edited a major collection in 2011 on the centenary of the publication of William Sanday's Oxford Studies in the Synoptic Problem (1911). Kloppenborg has also done original research and written on the social world of the early Jesus movement in Jewish Palestine, cultic associations and occupational guilds in the eastern Roman Empire and the social significance of the parables of Jesus. Other areas of interest have been the letters of the New Testament, especially the Letter of James, and the culture of the Graeco- Roman world as relates to such matters as: religion, spirituality, cultic associations, ethnic sub-groups and their ancient organization, professional societies and the general conditions of the societies in the Near East during the time of Second Temple Judaism, the time of Jesus and the formation of the Bible as we know it. Tenants in the Vineyard Published in 2006, Kloppenborg's book, The Tenants in the Vineyard: Ideology, Economics, and Agrarian Conflict in Jewish Palestine, titled after the \\"tenants in the vineyard\\" parable attributed to Jesus by the New Testament, provides an analysis for the critical reader of the Bible of this very difficult parable. The bible citation for the parable is Mark 12:1-12 and it is also recorded in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas (65). In his book, Kloppenborg models a new approach to the parables of Jesus. He discusses the ideological interests engaged by the parable in modern times and over the history of the Christian Church. Next, he explains the conditions of the society in which the parable was first laid out, especially in regards to ancient viticulture. In his conclusions, Kloppenborg notes that the parable has ironically been interpreted from the viewpoint of those in power in politics and society rather than as a literary parable or as an \\"anti-power\\" parable, as it may have read in the original texts. He shows that the editing in Mark's version of the story takes it beyond the useful idiom common to Jesus' other parables. Kloppenborg also includes a second volume documenting historical papyrus dealing with ancient viticulture and agrarian conflict. Critical Edition of Q Published in 2000, by James M. Robinson, Paul Hoffmann, and John S. Kloppenborg, The Critical Edition of Q: Synopsis including the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Mark and Thomas with English, German, and French Translations of Q and Thomas is a groundbreaking, though still controversial, work of scholarship. Containing a lengthy introduction by bible scholar James M. Robinson and a foreword by the three editor scholars: Robinson, John S. Kloppenborg and Paul Hoffmann, this hefty volume provides a redacted version of what the original Q document might have looked like whether it was written in Greek or Aramaic. The Critical Edition of Q is the product of the International Q Project (IQP), a program inaugurated at the Society of Biblical Literature in 1985 that has sought to establish an accessible critical edition of the source shared by Matthew and Luke. Their work also seeks to \\"document the major turning points in the history of Q research, with particular attention to the problem of establishing a critical text of Q\\" (xix). Putting aside \\"a purely hypothetical Aramaic source\\" of Matthew and Luke, which would mean that \\"Q would never be more than a hypothesis,\\" Robinson claims, in the introduction, that such approaches have been \\"completely replaced by objective criteria, based on empirical observation of Matthean and Lukan redactional traits\\" (xix). The bulk of the text is the critical text of Q (1-561), which concludes with a concordance of Q (Greek words [563-81]). The volume also contains a discussion of divergences from the Lukan sequence (lxxxix), text-critical notes (xc-cvi), and end-pages (cvii). The critical text itself is formatted with eight columns on facing pages presenting by column: 1) any Markan parallel to Matthew, 2) any doublets found in Matthew, 3) the text in Matthew that is deemed to be derived from Q, 4) the critical text of Q, 5) the text in Luke that is deemed to be derived from Q, 6) Luke's doublets, 7) any Markan parallel to Luke, and 8) any parallel from the Gospel of Thomas, the Coptic of which is provided but also retroverted into Greek. As footnotes, the Thomas and Q texts are translated into English, French and German. The editors intend this volume to be functional as a standard research tool for the study of Q despite the continuing controversy over the validity of the text actually existing; this is the most comprehensive effort to provide such a tool nonetheless.

Student loan debt in the United States has grown rapidly since 2006. The debt was ~$1.6 trillion in 2019 which was ~7.5% of 2019 GDP.https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenparis/2019/03/31/student-loan-debt- still-impacting-millennial-homebuyers/#4233ecac3e78 Loans usually must be repaid, in contrast to other forms of financial aid such as scholarships, which never have to be repaid, and grants, which rarely have to be repaid. Research indicates the increased usage of student loans has been a significant factor in college cost increases. US leaders have acknowledged the rise in student loan debt as a crisis. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has noted that Federal Student Aid's portfolio \\"is nearly 10 percent of our nation's debt.\\"https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-us-secretary- education-betsy-devos-federal-student-aids-training-conference Approximately 45 million people have student loan debt. In 2018, the average borrower owed $37,172 at the time of graduation, an increase of $20,000 from 2005. Student loan debt is unevenly distributed, and race and social class are significant factors in the distribution of student loans. Approximately 30 percent of all college students do not incur debt.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/heres-how- much-the-average-student-loan-borrower-owes-when-they-graduate.html The schools with the highest amount of student loan debt are University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University.https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/07/ConferenceDraft_LooneyYannelis_StudentLoanDefaults.pdf Except for Nova Southeastern, they are all proprietary (profit-making) universities. The default rate for borrowers who didn't complete their degree is three times as high as the rate for those who did. Student loan defaults are disproportionately concentrated in the for-profit college sector. In 2018, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the 12-year student loan default rate for colleges was 52 percent.https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-for-profit-college- loan-default0-20171005-story.html The 12-year student loan default rate for African Americans going to for-profit colleges was reported to be 65.7 percent.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/black-americans- twice-as-likely-as-whites-to-default-on-student-debt A 2018 Brookings Institution study projected that \\"nearly 40 percent of students who took out loans in 2004 may default by 2023.\\" History The student loan program includes the following time periods - 1958‚Äì1972 with the first federal student loans and the creation of Sallie Mae, mid-1960s-1978 with high rates of default, and mid-1990s-present with ballooning debt. Overview Student loan debt rose from $480.1 billion (3.5% GDP) in Q1 2006 to $1,683 billion (7.8% GDP) in Q1 2020. Compared to most nations, student loans play a significant role in U.S. higher education. Nearly 20 million Americans attend college each year, of whom close to 12 million or 60% borrow annually to help cover costs. In Europe, higher education receives much more government funding, so student loans are much less common. In parts of Asia and Latin America government funding for post-secondary education is lower usually limited to a few flagship universities, like the Mexican UNAM and there are no special programs under which students can easily and inexpensively borrow money. In the United States, much of college is funded by students and their families through loans, although public institutions are funded in part through state and local taxes, and both private and public institutions through Pell grants and, especially with older schools, gifts from donors and alumni, and investment earnings.Michael Simkovic, Risk-Based Student Loans (2012) Some believe this substantially increases intergenerational correlations in income (having two generations of a family have similar earning ability), although other factors have been estimated to play a larger combined role. Historically, higher education in the US was perceived as a good investment for many individuals and for the public, even though differences in the returns of educational investment across schools were often overstated.OECD, Education at a Glance (2011) Student loans come in several varieties in the United States, but are basically split into federal loans and private student loans. The federal loans, for which the FAFSA is the application, are subdivided into subsidized (the government pays the interest while the student is studying at least half- time) and unsubsidized. Federal student loans are subsidized at the undergraduate level only. Subsidized loans generally defer payments and interest until some period (usually six months) after the student has graduated. Some states have their own loan programs, as do some colleges.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (2012) Private Student Loans. See also: Report Details Woes of Student Loan Debt. NYT. In almost all cases, these student loans have better conditions sometimes much better than the heavily advertised and expensive private student loans. Student loans may be used for any college-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, computers, and transportation expenses. The main types of student loans in the United States are the following: * Federal student loans made to students directly (Stafford and Perkins loans). These loans are made regardless of credit history (most students have no credit history); approval is automatic if the student meets program requirements. The student makes no payments while enrolled in at least half-time studies. If a student drops below half time or graduates, there is a six-month grace period. If the student re-enrolls in at least half-time status, the loans are deferred, but when they drop below half time again they no longer have access to a grace period and repayment must begin. All Perkins loans and some undergraduate Stafford loans receive subsidies from the federal government. Amounts of both subsidized and unsubsidized loans are limited. :There are many deferments and a number of forbearances (cancellation of loan) one can get in the Direct Loan program. For those who are disabled, there is also the possibility of 100% loan discharge (cancellation of loan). Due to changes by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, it became easier to get one of these discharges after July 1, 2010. There are loan forgiveness provisions for teachers in specific critical subjects or in a school with more than 30% of its students on reduced-price lunch (a common measure of poverty), and qualify for loan forgiveness of all their Stafford, Perkins, and Federal Family Education Loan Program loans totalling up to $77,500.Wondering whether you can get your federal student loans forgiven or canceled for your service as a teacher?. FederalStudentAid.gov. In addition, any person employed full-time (in any position) by any 501(c)(3) non-profit, or another qualifying public service organization, or serving in a full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps position, qualifies for loan forgiveness (cancellation) after 120 qualifying payments. The 120 qualifying monthly payments do not need to be consecutive; they can be interrupted without penalty if there is a period of employment with a nonqualifying employer,.Public Service Loan Forgiveness. FinAid.org. See also: H.R. 2669 (110th): College Cost Reduction and Access Act: Library of Congress Summary. However, loan forgivenesses or discharges are considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. 108(f).U.S.C. * Federal student loans made to parents (PLUS loans): Much higher limit, but payments start immediately. Credit history is considered; approval is not automatic. * Private student loans, made to students or parents: Higher limits and no payments until after graduation, although interest starts to accrue immediately and the deferred interest is added to the principal, so there is interest on the (deferred) interest (which Is not the case with subsidized student loans). Interest rates are higher than those of federal loans, which are set by the United States Congress. Private loans are, or should be, a last resort, when federal and other loan programs are exhausted. Any college financial aid officer will recommend you borrow the maximum under federal programs before turning to private loans. Social class differences in student loan debt According to the Saint Louis Fed, \\"existing racial wealth disparities and soaring higher education costs may actually replicate racial wealth disparities across generations by driving racial disparities in student loan debt load and repayment.\\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/in-the- balance/2018/parents-wealth-helps-explain-racial-disparities-in-student-loan- debt Race and gender differences in student loan debt According to the New York Times \\"recent black graduates of four-year colleges owe, on average, $7,400 more than their white peers.

The student loan program, along with other parts of the Act, which subsidized college professor training, was established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite, and a widespread perception that the United States was falling behind in science and technology, in the middle of the Cold War. Student loans were extended more broadly in the 1960s under the Higher Education Act of 1965, with the goal of encouraging greater social mobility and equality of opportunity. Prior to 2010, Federal loans included 1) direct loans originated and funded directly by the United States Department of Education and 2) loans originated and funded by private investors and guaranteed by the federal government. Guaranteed loans were eliminated in 2010 through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act and replaced with direct loans because of a belief that guaranteed loans benefited private student loan companies at taxpayers expense, but did not reduce costs for students. The Trump administration commissioned private consultants to estimate the value of the U.S. government's student-loan portfolio, in order to possibly sell all or some of the debt to private investors.https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump- administration-hires-mckinsey-to-evaluate-student-loan- portfolio-11556728035https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/devos-student- loans-1402546https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/trump-administration- mckinsey-student-loan-debt/index.html These loans are available to college and university students via funds disbursed directly to the school and are used to supplement personal and family resources, scholarships, grants, and work- study. They may be subsidized by the U.S. Government or unsubsidized, depending on financial need. The U.S. Department of Education published a booklet comparing federal loans with private loans and specifying allowable expenses: > \\"You may use the money you receive only to pay for education expenses at the > school that awarded your loan. Education expenses include school charges > such as tuition, room and board, fees, books, supplies, equipment, dependent > childcare expenses, transportation, and rental or purchase of a personal > computer.\\" Both subsidized and unsubsidized loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education, either directly or through guarantee agencies. In 1967, the publicly-owned Bank of North Dakota made the first federally-insured student loan in the United States.https://bismarckstate.edu/alumnifoundation/news/BSCalumwasfirstfederalloanrecipient/https://bismarcktribune.com/news/state- and-regional/bank-of-north-dakota-will-end-student-loan- program/article_5ddf0668-3c73-11df-8c35-001cc4c03286.html The loans that are provided are the Stafford and Perkins loans regulated by the U.S. Department of Education. Nearly all students are eligible to receive federal loans (regardless of credit score or other financial issues). Federal student loans are not priced according to any individualized measure of risk, nor are loan limits determined based on risk. Rather, pricing and loan limits are politically determined by Congress. Undergraduates typically receive lower interest rates, but graduate students typically can borrow more. This lack of risk-based pricing has been criticized by scholars as contributing to inefficiency in higher education. Both types offer a grace period of six months, which means that no payments are due until six months after graduation or after the borrower becomes a less-than-half-time student without graduating. Both types have a fairly modest annual limit. The dependent undergraduate limit effective for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 is as follows (combined subsidized and unsubsidized limits): $5,500 per year for freshman undergraduate students, $6,500 for sophomore undergraduates, and $7,500 per year for junior and senior undergraduate students, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or preparatory coursework for graduate programs. For independent undergraduates, the limits (combined subsidized and unsubsidized) effective for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 are higher: $9,500 per year for freshman undergraduate students, $10,500 for sophomore undergraduates, and $12,500 per year for junior and senior undergraduate students, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or preparatory coursework for graduate programs. Subsidized federal student loans are only offered to students with a demonstrated financial need. Financial need may vary from school to school. For these loans, the federal government makes interest payments while the student is in college. For example, those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 upon graduation. Unsubsidized federal student loans are also guaranteed by the U.S. Government, but the government, while controlling (setting) the interest rate, does not pay interest for the student; rather, the interest accrues during college. Nearly all students are eligible for these loans regardless of financial need (on need, see Expected Family Contribution). Those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 plus interest upon graduation. For example, those who borrowed $10,000 and had $2,000 accrue in interest owe $12,000. Interest begins accruing on the $12,000, i.e., there is interest on the interest. The accrued interest is \\"capitalized\\" into the loan amount, and the borrower begins making payments on the accumulated total. Students can pay the interest while still in college, but few do so. Federal student loans for graduate students have higher limits: $8,500 for subsidized Stafford and $12,500 (limits may differ for certain courses of study) for unsubsidized Stafford. Many students also take advantage of the Federal Perkins Loan. For graduate students the limit for Perkins is $6,000 per year. Stafford loan aggregate limits Students who borrow money for education through Stafford loans cannot exceed certain aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For undergraduate dependent students, the maximum aggregate limit of subsidized and unsubsidized loans combined is $57,500, with subsidized loans limited to a maximum of $23,000 of the total loans. Students who have borrowed the maximum amount in subsidized loans may (based on grade level‚Äîundergraduate, graduate/professional, etc.) take out a loan of less than or equal to the amount they would have been eligible for in subsidized loans. Once both the subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate limits have been met for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans, the student is unable to borrow additional Stafford loans until they pay back a portion of the borrowed funds. A student who has paid back some of these amounts regains eligibility up to the aggregate limits as before. Graduate students have a lifetime aggregate loan limit of $138,500. Loans to parents Usually these are PLUS loans (formerly standing for \\"Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students\\"). Unlike loans made to students, parents can borrow much more, usually enough to cover the remainder of the costs student financial aid does not cover. Interest accrues during the time the student is in school. The interest rates for the PLUS loans as of 2017 are 7% for Stafford loans. No payments are required until the student is no longer in school, although parents may start repayment ahead of time if they want, thus saving on interest. The parents are responsible for repayment on these loans, not the student. Loans to parents are not a 'cosigner' loan with the student having equal accountability. The parents have signed the master promissory note to repay the loan and, if they do not repay the loan, their credit rating will suffer. Also, parents are advised to consider what their monthly payments will be after borrowing for four years at this rate (initial loan documents will give the repayment schedule as if only one year of loans was taken out). What sounds like a \\"manageable\\" debt load of (for example) $200 a month from freshman year loans can mushroom to a much more daunting $800 a month by the time four years have been funded through loans. Borrowing is not free, and the more borrowed, the more expensive it is. Additionally, PLUS loans consider credit history, making it more difficult for low income parents to qualify. Under new legislation, graduate students are eligible to receive PLUS loans in their own names. These Graduate PLUS loans have the same interest rates and terms of Parent PLUS loans. The current interest rate on these loans is 7%.https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus#interest Disbursement Federal Direct Student Loans, also known as Direct Loans or FDLP loans, are funded from public capital originating with the United States Treasury. FDLP loans are distributed through a channel that begins with the U.S. Treasury Department and from there passes through the United States Department of Education, then to the college or university and then to the student. According to the United States Department of Education, more than 6,000 colleges, universities, and technical schools participate in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), which represents about 80% of all schools. FFELP lending represents 75% of all federal student loan volume. In 2010, the Health Care Reform Act incorporated provisions on Education, which terminated the Federal Family Education Loan Appropriations after June 30, 2010. From that date on, all government-backed student loans have been issued through the Direct Loans program. Debt levels Distribution of student loan debt in the U.S. The maximum amount that any student can borrow is adjusted as federal policies change. Current loan limits are below the cost of most four year private institutions and most flagship public universities, and students therefore typically borrow higher cost private student loans to make up the difference. Scholars have advocated increasing federal debt limits to reduce the interest charges to student debtors. The maximum amount that any student can borrow is adjusted as federal policies change. A study published in the winter 1996 edition of the Journal of Student Financial Aid, ‚ÄúHow Much Student Loan Debt Is Too Much?‚Äù suggested that the monthly student debt payment for the average undergraduate should not exceed 8% of total monthly income after graduation. Some financial aid advisers have referred to this as \\"the 8% rule.\\" Circumstances vary for individuals, so the 8% level is an indicator, not a rule set in stone. A research report about the 8% level is available at the Iowa College Student Aid Commission.Greiner, K., How Much Student Loan Debt is too Much?, Journal of Student Financial Aid, v26, n1, p7-16, Winter, 1996. ERIC document EJ527952 Out of 100 students who ever attended a for-profit, 23 defaulted within 12 years of starting college in the 1996 cohort compared to 43 in the 2004 cohort (compared to an increase from just 8 to 11 students among entrants who never attended a for-profit). The Economist reported in June 2014 that United States student loan debt exceeded $1.2 trillion, with over 7 million debtors in default. Debt and default among black college students is at crisis levels, and even a bachelor's degree is no guarantee of security: black BA graduates default at five times the rate of white BA graduates (21 versus 4 percent), and are more likely to default than white dropouts. Public universities increased their fees by a total of 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, with out-of-state students paying more than $19,000. For two decades ending in 2013, college costs have risen 1.6% more than inflation each year. Government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012. Student enrollments rose from 15.2 million in 1999 to 20.4 million in 2011, but fell 2% in 2012.The Economist-Creative destruction-June 28, 2014The Economist-The digital degree-June 28, 2014 Private loans These are loans that are not guaranteed by a government agency and are made to students by banks or finance companies. Private loans cost more and have much less favorable terms than federal loans, and are generally only used when students have exhausted the borrowing limit under federal student loans. They are not eligible for Income Based Repayment plans, and frequently have less flexible payment terms, higher fees, and more penalties.Philip G. Schrag & Charles W. Pruett, Coordinating Loan Repayment Assistance Programs with New Federal Legislation, 60 J. LEGAL EDUC. 583, 590-597 (2010) Advocates of private student loans suggest that they combine the best elements of the different government loans into one: they generally offer higher loan limits than federal student loans, ensuring the student is not left with a budget gap. Unlike federal parent (PLUS) loans, they generally offer a grace period of six months (occasionally 12 months) with no payments due until after graduation; however, interest accrues and is added to the principal. Most experts unconnected to the private loan industry recommend private student loans only as an expensive last resort, because of the higher interest rates, multiple fees, and lack of the borrower and oversight protections which are built into the federal loans. Loan types Private student loans generally come in two types: school-channel and direct- to-consumer. School-channel loans offer borrowers lower interest rates but generally take longer to process. School-channel loans are \\"certified\\" by the school, which means the school signs off on the borrowing amount, and the funds are disbursed directly to the school. The \\"certification\\" means only that the school confirms the loan funds will be used for educational expenses only, and agrees to hold them and disburse them as needed. Certification does not mean that the school approves of, recommends, or has even examined the terms (conditions) of the loan. Direct-to-consumer private loans are not certified by the school; schools don't interact with a direct-to-consumer private loan at all. The student simply supplies enrollment verification to the lender, and the loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the student. While direct-to-consumer loans generally carry higher interest rates than school- channel loans, they do allow families to get access to funds very quickly ‚Äî in some cases, in a matter of days. Some argue that this convenience is offset by the risk of student over-borrowing and/or use of funds for inappropriate purposes, since there is no third-party certification that the amount of the loan is appropriate for the education needs of the student in question, or that it will be used only for education. Direct-to-consumer private loans was the fastest growing segment of education finance with the \\"percentage of undergraduates obtaining private loans from 2003‚Äì04 to 2007‚Äì08 rose from 5 percent to 14 percent\\" and were under legislative scrutiny due to the lack of school certification.Woo, Jennie, H., and (ED) National Center for Education Statistics. \\"The Expansion of Private Loans in Postsecondary Education. Stats in Brief. NCES 2012-184\\" National Center For Education Statistics (2011): ERIC. Web. May 21, 2014SANTO JR., G. F., & RALL, L. L. (2010). Private Student Loan Financing in an Era of Needs and Challenges. Journal of Structured Finance, 16(3), 106-115. Loan providers range from large education finance companies to specialty companies that focus exclusively on this niche. Lenders often push such loans by advertising: \\"no FAFSA required,\\" or \\"Funds disbursed directly to you.\\" But since the passing of Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010(HCERA), the death knell sounded for private sector lending under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). Since July 1, 2010, no new student loans have been made under the FFELP; all subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, PLUS loans, and Consolidation loans have been made solely under the Federal Direct Loan Program. Interest rates Federal student loan interest rates are set by Congress, and fixed. Private student loans usually have substantially higher interest rates, and the rates fluctuate depending on the financial markets. Some private loans disguise the true cost of borrowing by requiring substantial up-front origination \\"fees\\", which enable deceptively lower interest rates to be offered. Interest rates also vary depending on the applicant's credit history. Most private loan programs are tied to one or more financial indexes, such as the Wall Street Journal Prime rate or the BBA LIBOR rate, plus an overhead charge. Because private loans are based on the credit history of the applicant, the overhead charge varies. Students and families with excellent credit generally receive lower rates and smaller loan origination fees than those with poorer credit histories. Money paid toward interest is now tax deductible. However, lenders rarely give complete details of the terms of the private student loan until after the student submits an application, in part because this helps prevent comparisons based on cost. For example, many lenders only advertise the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers). Borrowers with bad credit can expect interest rates that are as much as 6% higher, loan fees that are as much as 9% higher, and loan limits that are two-thirds lower than the advertised figures. Loan fees Private loans often carry an origination fee, which can be substantial. Origination fees are a one-time charge based on the amount of the loan. They can be taken out of the total loan amount or added on top of the total loan amount, often at the borrower's preference. Some lenders offer low-interest, 0-fee loans. Each percentage point on the front-end fee gets paid once, while each percentage point on the interest rate is calculated and paid throughout the life of the loan. Some have suggested that this makes the interest rate more critical than the origination fee. The amount that is borrowed from private lenders accumulates to about 15 billion borrowed from private loans. In fact, there is an easy solution to the fee- vs.-rate question: All lenders are legally required to provide you a statement of the \\"APR (Annual Percentage Rate)\\" for the loan before you sign a promissory note and commit to it. Unlike the \\"base\\" rate, this rate includes any fees charged and can be thought of as the \\"effective\\" interest rate including actual interest, fees, etc. When comparing loans, it may be easier to compare APR rather than \\"rate\\" to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison. APR is the best yardstick to compare loans that have the same repayment term; however, if the repayment terms are different, APR becomes a less-perfect comparison tool. With different term loans, consumers often look to \\"total financing costs\\" to understand their financing options. Loan terms In contrast with federal loans, whose terms are public and standardized, the terms for private loans vary from lender to lender. However, it is not easy to compare them, as some conditions may not be revealed until the student is presented with a contract (promissory note) to sign. A common suggestion is to shop around on all terms, not just respond to \\"rates as low as...\\" tactics that are sometimes little more than bait-and-switch. However, shopping around could damage your credit score. Examples of other borrower terms and benefits that vary by lender are deferments (amount of time after leaving school before payments start) and forbearances (a period when payments are temporarily stopped due to financial or other hardship). These policies are solely based on the contract between lender and borrower and not set by Department of Education policies. Cosigners Private student loan programs generally issue loans based on the credit history of the applicant and any applicable cosigner, co-endorser or coborrower. In contrast, federal loan programs deal primarily with need-based criteria, as defined by the EFC and the FAFSA. Students may find that their families have too much income or too many assets to qualify for federal aid, but lack sufficient assets and income to pay for school without assistance. Most students will need a cosigner in order to obtain a private student loan. Many international students in the United States can obtain private loans (they are usually ineligible for federal loans) with a cosigner who is a United States citizen or permanent resident. However, some graduate programs (notably top MBA programs) have a tie-up with private loan providers and in those cases no cosigner is needed even for international students.Jain, Ayushman (2012).

Retrieved on 5/23/14 from http://mbablogs.anderson.ucla.edu/mba_students/2012/07/money-matters- financing-your-mba-at-ucla.html After a student and the student's co-signer are approved for a student loan, a private student loan lender may offer a co- signer release option, which \\"releases\\" the original co-signer from any financial responsibility for the student loan. There are several student loan lenders who offer co-signer releases and other benefits. Repayment and Default=Key metrics Key metrics in the student loan industry are student loan repayment rate,https://trends.collegeboard.org/student- aid/figures-tables/federal-student-loan-repayment-rate-completion-status and student loan default rate, such as the one-, three-,https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education- postsecondary/reports/2018/07/10/453199/getting-repayment-rates-right/ five-, and seven-year default rates.https://robertkelchen.com/2017/09/28/examining- trends-in-student-loan-repayment-rates/ =Repayment rate= The three year student loan repayment rate for each school that receives Title IV funding is available at the US Department of Education's College Scorecard. This number may be a poor indicator of the overall student loan default rate, and some schools have learned to game the system by deferring loans beyond the three year window.https://www.chronicle.com/article/Student-Loan-Default-Rates- Are/228771 =Default rate= According to the Center for American Progress, the percentage of borrowers in default is 10 percent after three years and 16 percent after five years. However, the US Department of Education only publishes three year default rates. The default rate for borrowers who didn't complete their degree is three times as high as the rate for those who did. Standard repayment When Federal student loans enter repayment, they are automatically enrolled in standard repayment. Under it, a borrower has 10 years to repay the total amount of his or her loan. The loan servicer (whoever is sending the bill) determines the monthly bill by calculating a fixed monthly payment amount that will pay off the original loan amount plus all accrued interest after 120 equal payments (12 payments per year). Payments pay off the interest building up each month, plus part of the original loan amount. Depending on the amount of the loan, the loan term may be shorter than 10 years. There is a $50 minimum monthly payment. On July 25, 2018, US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos issued an order declaring that the Borrower Defense Program, which was enacted by the US Department of Education in November 2016, would be repealed and replaced with a stricter repayment policy effective July 1, 2019. Under DeVos' policy, when a school closes for fraud before conferring degrees to its students, those students' loans are not forgiven automatically; rather, students must prove that they were financially harmed. There were bipartisan votes in the House and Senate in early 2020 to overturn DeVos' order, but President Trump vetoed the congressional legislation, siding with DeVos. Income-driven repayment plansIncome-based repayment= If a student's loan debt is high but their income is modest or zero, they may qualify for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Most major types of federal student loans‚Äîexcept for PLUS loans for parents‚Äîare eligible for an IDR plan. Income-driven plans allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments to 10%, 15%, or 20% of disposable income for up to 20 or 25 years, after which the remaining balance is forgiven. Currently, four specific IDRs are available: 1\\\\. Income-Based Repayment (IBR) 2\\\\. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) 3\\\\. Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) 4\\\\. Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) = Income share agreements = An income share agreement is an alternative to a traditional loan. During the term of an income share agreement the student agrees that after graduation the student will pay a percentage of their salary to the educational institution. Purdue University is an example of a university that offers an income share agreement to its students. Defenses to repayment Under some circumstances, student loan debt can be canceled. For example, if a student attended a school while it closed or if the student was enrolled by means of false claims, they may be able to file defense to repayment paperwork.https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/loan- forgiveness/borrower-defense-data Leaving the country to evade repayment Debt evasion is the intentional act of trying to avoid attempts by creditors to collect or pursue one's debt. Some news accounts report that individuals are fleeing the US in order to stop repaying their student loans. While leaving the country does not discharge the loan or stop interest and penalties from accruing, it is generally more difficult to collect debts against debtors who reside in foreign nations. Some nations may enter into agreements with the US to facilitate the collection of student loans. After default, co-signers of student loans remain liable for repayment of the loan. Cosigners are often the parents of the borrowers. Student loans in bankruptcy proceedings United States federal student loans and some private student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy only with a showing of \\"undue hardship.\\" In contrast to credit card debt, which often can be discharged through bankruptcy proceedings, this option is not generally available for educational loan debt. Additionally, those seeking to discharge their student loan debt must initiate an adversary proceeding, a separate lawsuit within the bankruptcy case where they illustrate the required undue hardship. Many borrowers cannot afford to retain an attorney or the additional litigation costs associated with an adversary proceeding, let alone a bankruptcy case. Further complicating matters, the undue hardship standard varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but is generally difficult to meet, making student loans practically non- dischargeable through bankruptcy. In most circuits discharge depends on meeting three prongs in the Brunner test: > As noted by the district court, there is very little appellate authority on > the definition of \\"undue hardship\\" in the context of 11 U.S.C. ¬ß > 523(a)(8)(B). Based on legislative history and the decisions of other > district and bankruptcy courts, the district court adopted a standard for > \\"undue hardship\\" requiring a three-part showing: (1) that the debtor cannot > maintain, based on current income and expenses, a \\"minimal\\" standard of > living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that > additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is > likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the > student loans; and (3) that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay > the loans. For the reasons set forth in the district court's order, we adopt > this analysis. The first part of this test has been applied frequently as > the minimum necessary to establish \\"undue hardship.\\" See, e.g., Bryant v. > Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Bryant), 72 B.R. 913, 915 > (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1987); North Dakota State Bd. of Higher Educ. v. Frech (In re > Frech), 62 B.R. 235 (Bankr.D.Minn.1986); Marion v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. > Assistance Agency (In re Marion), 61 B.R. 815 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1986). Requiring > such a showing comports with common sense as well. While federal student loans can be discharged administratively for total and permanent disability, private student loans cannot be discharged outside of bankruptcy. One set of empirical data comes from Education Credit Management Corporation, which serviced loans for twenty-five lending agencies and the United States Department of Education; in 2008 it was reported that of 72,000 loans in bankruptcy proceedings, only 276 debtors attempted discharge, and by November 2009 of the 134 resolutions thus far, 29 resulted in total or partial discharge.Melear KB. (2011). The Devil's Undue: Student Loan Discharged in Bankruptcy. Published in West's Education Law Reporter. A review of records in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington found that 57% of the 115 adversary proceedings reviewed in a 5-year period resulted in partial discharge, through settlement or trial; however, the authors cautioned not to generalize the results of this small sample.Pardo RI, Lacey MR. (2009). The Real Student-Loan Scandal: Undue Hardship Discharge Litigation. American Bankruptcy Law Journal. Preprint at SSRN. 86% involved at least one of the United States Department of Education or the Education Credit Management Corporation, a nonprofit which services loans where the student has declared bankruptcy. The rules for total and permanent disability discharge underwent major changes as a result of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. Loan holders are no longer required to be unable to earn any income, but instead the standard is \\"substantial gainful activity\\" (SGA) as a result of disability. The new regulations took effect July 1, 2010. Under further changes that took effect July 1, 2013, if a borrower is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration, that determination will be accepted as proof of total and permanent disability if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle (the longest currently used by SSA). Effective with discharges on or after January 1, 2018, debt discharged due to the death or total permanent disability of the borrower is no longer treated as taxable income. This provision, part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, will sunset on December 31, 2025 unless renewed by Congress. Criticism In 1987, then-Secretary of Education William Bennett argued that ‚Äú... increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise their tuitions, confident that Federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.‚ÄùBennett, William J. \\"Our Greedy Colleges.\\" Nytimes.com. The New York Times Company, February 18, 1987. Web. April 28, 2016. This statement came to be known as the ‚ÄúBennett Hypothesis.‚Äù In July 2015 (revised in March 2016), a Staff Report was published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the conclusions of which indicate that institutions more exposed to increases in student loan program maximums tend to respond with disproportionate raises in tuition prices: > In this paper, we use a Bartik-like approach to identify the effect of > increased loan supply on tuition following large policy changes in federal > aid program maximums available to undergraduate students that occurred > between 2008 and 2010.

The federal student loan program has been criticized for not adjusting interest rates according to the riskiness of factors that are under students' control, such as choice of academic major. Critics have contended that this lack of risk-based pricing contributes to inefficiency and misallocation of resources in higher education, and lower productivity in the labor market. However, recent research indicates that while high levels of student loan debt, coupled with high default rates, present a number of challenges for individual student loan borrowers and for the federal government (which must cover the defaults through taxes), they do not necessarily place a substantial burden on society at large. After the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), both federal and private student loans are not discharged during bankruptcy (prior to the passage of this bill, only federal student loans were unable to be discharged). This provided a credit risk free loan for the lender, averaging 7 percent a year.Collinge, Alan. The student loan scam : the most oppressive debt in U.S. history, and how we can fight back. Boston, MA : Beacon Press, c2009. In January 2013, the \\"Fairness for Struggling Students Act\\" was unveiled. This bill, if passed, would have allowed private student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee where it died. Some critics of financial aid claim that, because schools are assured of receiving their fees no matter what happens to their students, they have felt free to raise their fees to very high levels, to accept students of inadequate academic ability, and to produce too many graduates in some fields of study. About one-third of students, whether or not they graduate or find jobs that match their credentials, are financially burdened for much of their lives by their debt obligations, instead of being economically productive citizens. When those former students default on their obligations, the burdens are shifted to taxpayers. Lastly, the proportion of graduates who come from poor backgrounds has actually declined since 1970. In 2007, then-Attorney General of New York State, Andrew Cuomo, led an investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities. Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to \\"preferred lenders\\" that charged higher interest rates. Some of these \\"preferred lenders\\" allegedly rewarded university financial aid staff with kick backs. This led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities. Many universities have also rebated millions of dollars in fees back to affected borrowers. The biggest lenders, Sallie Mae and Nelnet, are criticized by borrowers. They are frequently defendants in lawsuits, the most serious of which was filed in 2007. The False Claims Suit was filed on behalf of the federal government by former Department of Education researcher, Dr. Jon Oberg, against Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and other lenders. Oberg argued that the lenders overcharged the United States Government and defrauded taxpayers of over $22 million. In August 2010, Nelnet settled the lawsuit and paid $55 million. In an effort to improve the student loan market, startups like LendKey, SoFi (Social Finance, Inc.) and CommonBond were founded to offer student loans and refinance loans at lower rates than traditional repayment systems using an alumni-funded model. According to a 2016 analysis by online student loan marketplace Credible, about 8 million borrowers could qualify to refinance their loans at a lower interest rate.Lobosco, Katie. \\"8 million Americans could get a lower rate on their student loans\\", CNN Money, 15 November 2016. Retrieved on 10 March 2017. In June 2010, the amount of student loan debt held by Americans exceeded the amount of credit card debt held by Americans. At that time, student loan debt totaled at least $830 billion, of which approximately 80% was federal student loan debt and 20% was private student loan debt. By the fourth quarter of 2015, total outstanding student loans owned and securitized had risen to, and surpassed, $1.3 trillion.\\"Student Loans Owned and Securitized, Outstanding.\\" Research.stlouisfed.org. New York Federal Reserve, April 7, 2016. Web. April 19, 2016. This rising student debt is contributing to the expanding wealth gap.Carolyn Thompson (March 27, 2014). $1 trillion student loan debt widens US wealth gap. Associated Press. Retrieved July 6, 2014. Every year, student debt continues to rise. Nearly two-thirds of undergraduates are in debt. By graduation, their student loan debt averages around $26,600. One percent of graduates leave college with $100,000 or more of student loan debt. In 2013, the federal debt had grown to $16.7 trillion. Six percent of that debt comes directly from student loans making student loans only second to mortgages in consumer debt. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that as of May 2013, federal student loan debt had reached $1 trillion bringing the total number for outstanding student loan debt to $1.2 trillion. However, this amount does not include what students take from savings accounts, borrow from parents, or charge to their credit cards in order to pay for their education. In actuality, the burden of student debt is much greater than these numbers indicate. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's February 2017 Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit reported that 11.2% of aggregate student loan debt was 90 or more days delinquent in the final quarter of 2016. One of the biggest reasons that students decide not to go to college is the cost. Many times students are forced to choose between going to college or going straight to the workforce because they are unable to keep up with the ever- rising tuition. In the 20 years between 1987 and 2007, tuition costs rose 326% Best and Keppo (2014). Even adjusting for inflation, a community college education cost 33% less than it does now National Center for Education Statistics (2018). Books and supplies are another tremendous expense with some books for basic required classes costing hundreds of dollars. Because of these costs, 58% of those students who choose to go to school will be forced to take out student loans to continue their education. Many student who are unable to get loans, or determine that the cost of going to school is not worth the debt without the means to pay it back like they would if they had completed school. Student loans are also very dangerous because there is no way to get out from under them unless they are paid in full or the borrower dies. Even bankruptcy does not wipe away student loan debt, and borrowers must continue to pay the loans off for years after they have left school. Best, K., & Keppo, J. (2014). The credits that count: how credit growth and financial aid affect college tuition and fees. Education Economics, 22(6), 589‚Äì613. In April 2019, Brookings Institution fellow Adam Looney, a long-time analyst of student loans stated that: > \\"It is an outrage that the federal government offers loans to students at > low-quality institutions even when we know those schools don‚Äôt boost their > earnings and that those borrowers won‚Äôt be able to repay their loans.

Reform proposals According to Harvard Business School researchers, \\"when student debt is erased, a huge burden is lifted and people take big steps to improve their lives: They seek higher-paying careers in new states, improve their education, get their other finances in order, and make more substantial contributions to the economy.\\" https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/forgiving-student- loan-debt-leads-to-better-jobs-stronger-consumers Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and US Representative Tulsi Gabbard have endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders' College for All Act. The policy would eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities, lower student loan interest rates, and allow those with existing debt to refinance their student loans. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) reintroduced the Debt Free College Act in 2019. The co-sponsors are Senators Sherrod Brown, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Jeff Merkley, Richard Blumenthal, Kirsten Gillebrand, Richard Durbin, Tammy Baldwin, and Elizabeth Warren. Some conservative pundits have proposed that colleges limit student loans and share the liability on defaulted student loans. The New York Times published an editorial in 2011 in support of allowing private loans to again be discharged during bankruptcy. In June 2019, Bernie Sanders offered a new proposal that would cancel $1.6 trillion of student loan, undergraduate and graduate debt for around 45 million Americans. ‚ÄúThis proposal completely eliminates student debt in this country and ends the absurdity of sentencing an entire generation, the millennial generation, to a lifetime of debt for the crime of doing the right thing -- and that is going out and getting a higher education,‚Äù Sanders said. On August 21, 2019, President Donald Trump ordered student loan forgiveness for permanently disabled veterans, which would save 25,000 veterans an average of $30,000 each.

In the 1920s, he played an important role in the Sovietization of the Caucasus, but later led Georgian Communist opposition to Joseph Stalin's centralizing policy during the Georgian Affair of 1922. In the 1930s, he was persecuted for his support of the Trotskyist opposition and executed during the Great Purge.  Revolution and Civil War  Mdivani joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1903 and engaged in revolutionary activities in Tbilisi, Baku, Batumi, and other industrial centers of the Caucasus. A close associate of Joseph Stalin, he quickly emerged as one of the leading Bolsheviks in the region and gained a reputation of a brilliant orator. During the Russian Civil War, that followed the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was commissioned to the Caucasus Front where he worked for the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party and served as a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 11th Army. In 1920, he was instrumental in the occupation of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Later that year, he was sent as a special envoy to Turkey in an effort to mediate a peace deal between the Turkish government and the Democratic Republic of Armenia. Early in 1921, Mdivani, along with Stalin and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, played an important role in engineering the Red Army invasion of Georgia which toppled down the local Menshevik-dominated government in favor of the Bolshevik regime. However, with the establishment of the Georgian SSR, Mdivani emerged as one of the leading proponents of the republic‚Äôs sovereignty from Moscow. He protested against a series of territorial rearrangements in Transcaucasia that dispossessed Georgia of several of its former districts and advocated more tolerance towards political opposition to ensure the survival of the highly unpopular Bolshevik government.  The Georgian Affair  On 7 July 1921 Filipp Makharadze, a moderate Georgian Communist leader, was removed from his position of the chairman of the Georgian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom) and replaced with Mdivani. During his tenure, Mdivani entered in a bitter conflict with Stalin and Ordzhonikidze who pursued hardliner, centralizing policy towards Georgia. This dispute known as the Georgian Affair peaked in 1922, when Mdivani and his comrades ‚Äì Makharadze, Mikhail Okudzhava, Sergey Kavtaradze, and Shalva Eliava ‚Äì were denounced by Stalin as \\"national deviationists\\". The Mdivani group, in their turn, accused their opponents of \\"Great Russian chauvinism\\" and tried to secure Lenin‚Äôs support, but without any success. The \\"deviationists\\"‚Äô failure to prevent the Georgian SSR from being amalgamated with the Armenian and Azerbaijan republics into the Transcaucasian SFSR resulted in the final victory of the Stalin-Ordzhonikidze line and the removal of Mdivani from his post in January 1923. The \\"national deviationists\\" were not actively persecuted until the late 1920s, however. Once Lenin had been incapacitated by a series of strokes, Stalin used his increasing power to remove Mdivani and other oppositionists to diplomatic posts. Mdivani served as the Soviet trade representative to France from 1924 until being excluded, in 1928, from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during Stalin‚Äôs crackdown on the Left Opposition. Reinstated three years later, he worked in various government positions, including as chairman of the Supreme Sovnarkhoz, People‚Äôs Commissar of Light Industry and first deputy chairman of the Georgian Council of People‚Äôs Commissars between 1931 and 1936.Mikaberidze, Alexander (ed., 2007), Mdivani, Budu . The Dictionary of Georgian National Biography. Retrieved on April 23, 2007. He remained an outspoken critic of Stalin‚Äôs Transcaucasian enterprise and was famous for his sarcastic comments on the Soviet leader. According to the modern historian Ami Knight, Mdivani liked to tell a joke about how Georgian workers urged Lavrentiy Beria to set up an armed guard around the house of Stalin‚Äôs mother, Ekaterina Geladze, in Tbilisi so that she would not give birth to another Stalin.Knight, Ami W. (1993), Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant, p. 79. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, ..  Repression  Stalin could not forgive Mdivani for his defiance and Mdivani became one of the first victims of the Great Purges. He was removed from his post and excluded from the party in late 1936. In May 1937, Mdivani was accused by Beria of having founded the \\"Trotskyite Centre for Espionage, Sabotage and Terrorism\\" with the aim to kill Beria and bring down the Soviet government. In July he was arrested and tried by the NKVD troika. During the interrogations at the Metekhi prison in Tbilisi, Mdivani repeatedly refused to \\"confess\\". He is quoted to have said to the troika members: \\"Being shot is not enough punishment for me; I need to be quartered! It was me who brought the 11th Army here [in Tbilisi]; I betrayed my people and helped Stalin and Beria, these degenerates, enslave Georgia and bring Lenin‚Äôs party to its knees.\\" Antonov-Ovsenko, A.

Introduction Prior to the foundation of APNET in 1992, publishers in Africa had difficulty sharing information and learning from one another‚Äôs experiences. There was no database containing the addresses of libraries, bookshops or fellow publishers; there was no networking structure connecting the agencies. After several conferences and seminars focused on solving the problems within the African publishing and book trade industry, it was concluded that \\"the need for networking as a means of information-sharing became paramount. It was necessary to set up an umbrella body which would be a network of publishers in Africa\\".Dekutsey, Woeli, The Story of APNET, African Publishers Network, commissioned by UNESCO. 1995.pg 4 In 1992, delegates from 9 countries founded the African Publishers Network at a conference in Harare, Zimbabwe. It relocated from Zimbabwe to Abidjan C√¥te d'Ivoire with a research and documentation centre located in Harare, Zimbabwe. However, due to the political situation in C√¥te d'Ivoire, APNET's headquarters is now in Accra, Ghana. APNET is a diverse network representing all regions from across Africa with 27 national publishers associations as members. The governance of APNET consists of four key parts which are interdependent: the General Council represents the totality of African members and meets once a year; the board is representative of Anglophone, Francophone, and Lusophone Africa and is the executive arm of the council; the Secretariat, which consists of Executive Secretary and Administrative Officer, manages the daily concerns of APNET and ascertains that everything is running smoothly. They also conduct many functions such as organizing training workshops and conferences and fundraising; the project committees oversee pertinent activities that are specifically assigned such as fulfilling research opportunities. In addition, membership to APNET consists of four levels: full membership (granted to national publishing associations); founding membership (among the publishers from the nine countries that started APNET); affiliate membership (for those interested in the work of APNET ‚Äì booksellers, editors, printers, designers, etc.); and associate membership for those with ‚Äúan outstanding record of service to African publishing‚Äù. Accomplishments APNET can claim many concrete achievements since its formation; in general, as an evaluation of APNET states: ‚ÄúThe formation and revitalization of many national publishers associations are a direct result of APNET‚Äôs networking activities, most consistently through person-to-person contact and the publication of the African Publishing Review‚Äù. The African Publishing Review (APR) is a bi- monthly newsletter sent out to publishers‚Äô associations, book development councils, libraries, etc., and other subscribers. For publishers in Africa, the APR is free of charge; however, other subscribers must pay a small fee. The African Publishing Review is the only pan-African publishing journal published in Africa with news, analysis, and in-depth perspectives of African Publishing. A survey was conducted and it showed that the APR is the ‚Äúsecond most important source of information‚Äù to publishers after the national publishers associations. A survey done by SIDA showed that the APR is the most frequently used form of APNET service. APNET has produced six other publications, including The Story of APNET, The Development Directory of Indigenous Publishing, African ‚ÄúRights‚Äù Indaba, APNET Children‚Äôs Books Catalogue, the Catalogue of Agricultural Books Published in Africa, and Towards an African Publishing Institute. The African universities lack programmes and classes for creating professional publishers: university training in this field is only available in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa, and these courses fall short of what is required. Based on the curriculum that was developed for the institute, APNET has conducted over 30 workshops in 18 countries. Other publications of APNET include a development directory which contains 70 entries on key African book-development organizational and professional bodies; essays and reports on publishing in Africa; a resource centre which is a source of published and unpublished research on publishing in Africa. Advocacy APNET advocates for the African publishing industry through attending book fairs, both in Africa and internationally. APNET goes beyond attending and providing materials for the book fair; it enables other African exhibitors to attend through financial support. In addition, when a book fair is being organized in Africa, APNET offers its support by arranging its major meetings to occur during the dates of the event so that all will be in the area to attend. Dialogue with the World Bank has proven to be a success for APNET. As the World Bank has reached a better understanding of APNET and dialogue has continued between the two, ‚ÄúAPNET has been in a position to send out World Bank monthly operational summaries to the National Publishers Associations, which provides information and possible opportunities for publishers‚ÄùChristensen, Lars P., and others, Strengthening Publishing in Africa: An evaluation of Apnet, Sweden: Sida, 1998. A trade and promotion program is conducted through APNET, which allocates catalogues of African books and sources and disseminates orders to publishers. The KAWI Project is a project that is supported by APNET with the hope that the African education curriculum will be built on textbooks that are locally produced and published. Science for Africa is a project that has created pan-African children‚Äôs science books; the KAWI series theme is focused on Renewable Energy. Both APNET and UNESCO have worked together to promote this series as they express the belief that only culturally relevant materials and a home-grown curriculum can improve learning opportunities and halt the reliance on imported educational materials.

Origins The first plane landed at the site of the airport in 1912 and was flown by Harry Atwood, establishing a long distance flight record from Chicago, Il to Camillus. The airport expanded over the next few years and by 1925 became known as the Amboy Airport. Municipal Airport By 1926, Syracuse Mayor Charles Hanna felt that the city needed an airport to enhance its economic future. The city scouted a number of small airports in the area, including Bethka Field (near the intersection of Thompson Rd. and James St. in the city proper) and Nedrow Field in nearby Nedrow, NY. The city finally decided upon the Amboy Airport and purchased it from Camillus for $50,000. After its official opening in 1927, Mayor Hanna put the airfield under the direction of the City Parks Department. After being purchased by the city, the airport gained popularity. The first airmail was delivered in 1929. In the following years before World War II, the airport featured appearances by many world- famous pilots including Charles Lindbergh and his Spirit of St. Louis airplane in 1927, Will Rogers and Wiley Post in 1931, General Jimmy Doolittle in 1932, Amelia Earhart in 1936, Douglas ‚ÄúWrong Way‚Äù Corrigan in 1938; as well as celebrities Kate Smith and Lowell Thomas. World War II After the war broke out, local flight instructors were pressed into military service and the airport turned into a flight training center. Shortly thereafter, the demands of the military quickly outgrew the capabilities of the current airport and the Office of the Chief of the Army Air Force allocated funds and authorized the construction of Hancock Field. However, the Municipal Airport still played a vital role in the war effort, serving as a training facility for civilians moving supplies and equipment and pilots patrolling the east coast for German ships and U-boats. Closure 1994 USGS aerial photo showing the former site of the airfield. A short segment of a runway turnaround area is visible in the middle left as well as hangars upper left. After the war, the city took over operations of Hancock Field, converting it to a commercial airfield in 1948. The smaller Municipal Airport couldn't compete with the larger and more centrally located Syracuse Hancock International Airport and closed in 1949. After its closure, most of the land the airport was located on was acquired by Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation and transformed into chemical waste beds by 1951.

Description Derived from the .50-60-400 Joslyn, the cartridge was developed after the unsatisfactory results of the .58 rimfire cartridge for the Springfield Model 1865 Trapdoor rifle. The .50-70 Government cartridge became the official cartridge of the US military until replaced by the .45-70 Government in 1873. The .50-70 cartridge had a pressure limit of 22,500 PSI. The official designation of this cartridge at the time of introduction was \\"US center-fire metallic cartridge\\", and the commercial designation .50-70-450, standing for : *caliber .50 *powder charge black powder *bullet weight Col. J.G Benton, \\"Springfield Breech Loading Rifle Musket, Model of 1868\\", United States Army, 1868 Ammunition with a black powder charge is currently available commercially from Buffalo Bore. Reloaders have experimented with a variety of bullet weights from 425 to in weight. Additionally, the US Navy contracted with Remington to produce several thousand Rolling Block carbines chambered for a reduced load version of this cartridge which was officially produced for use only in carbines. This reduced load cartridge used a shortened .50-70 with a bullet and of black powder. The US Navy also purchased Remington Rolling Block rifles chambered for the full size .50-70 cartridge. The US Army also ordered both Rolling Block rifles and carbines in caliber .50-70 and also made some Rolling Blocks at their Springfield Armory facility in this caliber.Remington Rolling Block Military Rifles, by George Layman The US Army also had a large supply of percussion-fired Sharps carbines at the close of the Civil War and had the Sharps Rifle company convert about 31,000 of those to caliber .50-70 for cavalry use. Meanwhile, the army, which had exited the Civil War with an inventory of almost a million percussion-fired muzzle loaders converted Springfield Model 1863 and Model 1864 muskets to metallic cartridge ammunition using the Allin conversion (trapdoor) method, as well as cadet rifles. The first of the .50-70 conversions was the Springfield Model 1866. Newer improved versions were made and used by the army through 1873. After 1873, with the advent of the 45-70 cartridge, the army declared the .50-70 to be surplus and while some rifles in .50-70 were issued to Indian scouts, the bulk were simply sold off as surplus. In the US Navy however, the 50-70 cartridge and the guns associated with it remained in use until the late 1880s. Buffalo Bill Cody used a Springfield Model 1866 in caliber .50-70 while hunting buffalo to feed the track workers of the Kansas Pacific Railroad (later Union Pacific Eastern Division). General G. A. Custer was known to have and use a sporterized Rolling Block in caliber .50-70 and was believed to have it with him at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. As army General Sheridan had embarked on a plan to eliminate the bison during the course of the American Indian Wars, the .50-70 rifles were also issued, or purchased, by buffalo hunters for use in eliminating the vast Bison herds. Sharps began manufacturing sporterized rifles in .50-70 (and later .50-90, .50-110, etc.) and with improved sights for longer range shots for use by the buffalo hunters. In 1867 the .50-70 cartridge in US Army Model of 1866 Springfield rifles played a pivotal role in holding off an attacking force of 300-1000 Lakota Sioux Indians during the Wagon Box Fight.Keenan, Jerry. The Wagon Box Fight, Boulder, CO: Lightning Tree Press, 1990, p. 22 Modern made functional replicas of caliber .50-70 historical rifles have been imported into the US by such firms as Davide Pedersoli and A.

Although often called a squid, it is now thought to be more closely related to modern octopuses. Examination of gladius remains has yielded an estimated mantle length close to or equal to that of the modern giant squid. Fossil remains have been found in parts of the one-time Western Interior Seaway of North America, including Late Cretaceous rocks in Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Manitoba Province. One species, T. longa, is traditionally recognized. Etymology American paleontologist William N. Logan (1869‚Äì1941) did not directly explain the name Tusoteuthis in 1898. The generic name may be formed from Latin tusus \\"crushed\\" (passive participle of Latin tundo \\"beat, crush\\") + Greek teuthis \\"squid\\", alluding to the typically fragmented condition of the fossil gladius: \\"Fragments of the shafts of Tusoteuthis longus or allied forms are abundant in the Ornithostoma beds, but complete specimens are extremely rare.\\" (pg. 498) The gender of the type species name was later corrected to the Latin feminine longa. Ecology Tusoteuthis is assumed to have preyed on other cephalopods, fish, and possibly even small marine reptiles. Despite its size, which was around 20 to 35 feet (6 to 11 metres) long with tentacles fully outstretched, Tusoteuthis was still preyed on by other animals, especially the many, various predatory fish of the Western Interior Seaway. A fossil of the predatory aulopiform, Cimolichthys nepaholica, was found with the gladius of T. longa in its gullet. The back portion of the gladius was in the stomach region, while the mouth of C. nepaholica had remained opened, suggesting that the fish had died in the middle of swallowing the cephalopod, tail first. Researchers strongly suspect that as the fish was swallowing Tusoteuthis, the head and/or tentacles remained outside the mouth, thus blocking the gills of the fish, and suffocating it as it swallowed its prey.

The band formed in 1981 and was led by Bjorn Stigsson. They released four albums before breaking up in 1990.  Background  The band's early releases were metal with symphonic influences using the Roland synthesizer guitar and Moog Taurus pedals. Knights of Heaven showed a move toward a more melodic rock based sound. In 1986 the band went through lineup changes: Ez Gom√©r was brought in to replace H√•kan Andersson on bass, and Terry Haw joined. Both were with the band through Setting Fire to the Earth (1987), then left to form Jet Circus. With this lineup they toured extensively in Europe throughout 1986‚Äì1987. They played the Greenbelt festival in England three times, 1984, 1985, and 1987, and the Scandinavium in Gothenburg twice (1985, 1987). The second appearance at the Scandinavium was with a festival, and was filmed by Sveriges Television. In early '88 they toured again in Sweden and in April they returned to England. Their first United States tour was in August 1988, when they opened for Larry Norman and played as his backup band. In fall of that year they toured for two months throughout Europe. together with Bloodgood and concluded the year playing the Ennepetal Christmas Rock Night festival in Germany for the second time. In 1989 they did touring again in Australia and completed two tours in the USSR. The same year they recorded Knights of Heaven in Los Angeles, produced by John Elefante. Before breaking up in the latter part on 1990 they again toured in the United States and Canada. The band (Jet Circus) did make an American appearance at the \\"Cornerstone\\" festival in Bushnell, Ill., the weekend of July 4, 1991. The band re-formed in March 2003 to play at the final Bobfest.

Playing career As a schoolboy, Holland progressed through the academy at Derby County until his late teens, when, after a bad injury, he was told that he would not be kept on. He had short stints playing professional football for Bury and for Husqvarna FF of Sweden and semi-pro for Northwich Victoria but, aged 21, Holland decided to go into coaching. Coaching career Holland was appointed as a youth coach at Crewe Alexandra in 1992, aged 22 by Dario Gradi, who had coached Holland as a schoolboy. Holland had successfully completed the FA Full Coaching Licence aged 22, one of the youngest recipients of the coaching award. Holland went on to work at the club for 17 years working with young players of every age in the club's highly successful youth Academy. Holland slowly made his way through the coaching ranks at Crewe before becoming the club's Academy Director. Holland also had a spell as first team coach during the club's successful period in the Championship. At the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Gradi revealed that Holland would be involved more in the first team set-up for the season. On 20 April 2007, it was announced by the football club that Gradi would be taking up a new role as Technical Director on 1 July 2007 while Holland would be promoted to the role of First-Team Coach, whilst keeping his job as Academy Director. Gradi said that Holland was the \\"right man\\" to eventually replace him and that the move was a \\"gradual transition\\". In July 2007 Holland completed the UEFan English Pro Licence coaching award and went on to complete the LMA-PFA Certificate in applied Management at Warwick University in 2009. The move meant that Holland's role at the club was much nearer to being a manager rather than a coach. He left this role on 18 November 2008 and was replaced by former manager Dario Gradi, after which he held talks with the club to decide his future there. In December 2008, it was reported that Holland would be leaving Crewe. In March 2009, he was appointed manager of the youth academy at nearby Stoke City. On 12 August 2009, Holland was named the reserve team manager for Chelsea. STEVE HOLLAND IS NEW RESERVE MANAGER In May 2011 Holland won the Premier Reserve League beating Blackburn in the Play-Off Final at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 1994. On 29 June 2011, it was announced that Holland would become assistant first team coach at Chelsea under new manager Andr√© Villas-Boas. When Villas-Boas was dismissed on 4 March 2012 and Roberto Di Matteo was appointed caretaker manager of Chelsea, Holland filled the role of assistant manager. He continued in this position under the interim manager Rafael Ben√≠tez. In 2013, Holland continued in his role as assistant manager under Jose Mourinho. In December 2015, Holland took temporary charge for a Premier League fixture against Sunderland. In January 2016, Holland became Assistant Manager to Guus Hiddink for the remainder of the 2015‚Äì2016 season and in July 2016 Holland became Assistant to Antonio Conte. In August 2013, Holland was appointed assistant manager to the new England Under 21s manager Gareth Southgate. Following the appointment of Gareth Southgate as the caretaker of the England national football team on 27 September 2016, when Sam Allardyce resigned after one game due to a corruption scandal, Holland also became assistant manager for the senior level. He left Chelsea after the 2016‚Äì2017 season ended.

This enzyme catalyzes the following reactions File:Dienoyl-CoA reductase reaction cis-trans.svg DECR1 participates in the beta oxidation and metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty enoyl-CoA esters. Specifically, it catalyzes the reduction of 2,4 dienoyl-CoA thioesters of varying length by NADPH cofactor to 3-trans-enoyl- CoA of equivalent length. Unlike the breakdown of saturated fat, cis and trans polyunsaturated fatty acid degradation requires three additional enzymes to generate a product compatible with the standard beta oxidation pathway. DECR is the second such enzyme (the others being enoyl CoA isomerase and dienoyl CoA isomerase) and is the rate limiting step in this auxiliary flow. DECR is capable of reducing both 2-trans,4-cis-dienoyl-CoA and 2-trans,4-trans- dienoyl-CoA thioesters with equal efficiency. At this time, there is no clear explanation for this of lack of stereo-specificity. Structure Crystallization of DECR with 2,4 Hexadienoyl-CoA and NADPH (not shown). Key residues in the enzyme active site orient the substrate for hydride transfer through a network of hydrogen bonds. Eukaryotic DECR exists in both the mitochondria (mDECR) and the peroxisome (pDECR, coded by gene DECR2). The enzymes from each organelle are homologous and part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SDR super-family. mDECR is 124 kDa consisting of 335 amino acids before post-translational modification. The secondary structure shares many of the motifs of SDR, including a Rossmann fold for strong NADPH binding. The protein exists as a homotetramer in physiological environment, but has been shown to also form monomers and dimers in solution. Crystallization of mDECR shows the enzyme provides a network of hydrogen bonds from key residues in the active site to NADPH and the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA which positions the hydride at 3.4 √Ö to the CŒ¥, compared with 4.0 √Ö to the CŒ≤ (not shown). The enolate intermediate discussed earlier is stabilized by residues additional hydrogen bonds to Tyr166 and Asn148. Lys214 and Ser210 (conserved residues in all SDR enzymes) are thought to increase the pKa of Tyr166 and stabilize the transition state. Additionally, at one end of the active site there is a flexible loop that provides sufficient room for long carbon chains. This likely gives the enzyme flexibility to process fatty acid chains of various lengths. Substrate length for mDECR catalysis is thought to be limited at 20 carbons, at which this very long chain fatty acid is first partially oxidized by pDECR in the peroxisome. Enzyme mechanism=Eukaryotic DECR 2,4 Dienoyl-CoA thioester reduction by NADPH to 3-Enoyl CoA occurs by a two-step sequential mechanism via an enolate intermediate. DECR binds NADPH and the fatty acid thioester and positions them for specific hydride transfer to the CŒ¥ on the hydrocarbon chain. The electrons from the CŒ≥-CŒ¥ double bond move over to the CŒ≤-CŒ≥ position, and those from the CŒ±-CŒ≤ form an enolate. In the final step, a proton is abstracted from the water to the CŒ± and the thioester is reformed, resulting in a single CŒ≤-CŒ≥ trans double bond. Since the final proton comes from water, the pH has a significant effect on the catalytic rate with the enzyme demonstrating maximal activity at ~6.0. A decrease in activity at pH < 6.0 can be explained by de-protonation of titratable residues that affect protein folding or substrate binding. Mutant proteins with modifications at key acidic amino acids (E154, E227, E276, D300, D117) show order of magnitude increases in Km and/or decreases in Vmax. Proposed mechanism of 2,4-Trans dienoyl-CoA reduction by NADPH in mammalian DECR. The mechanism proceeds stepwise through an enolate intermediate. Prokaryotic DECR 2,4 Dienoyl-CoA Reductase from Escherichia coli shares very similar kinetic properties to that of eukaryotes, but differs significantly in both structure and mechanism. In addition to NADPH, E. Coli DECR requires a set of FAD, FMN and iron‚Äìsulfur cluster molecules to complete the electron transfer. A further distinction is E. Coli DECR produces the final 2-trans-enoyl-CoA without the need for Enoyl CoA Isomerase. The active site contains accurately positioned Tyr166 that donates a proton to the CŒ≥ after hydride attack at the CŒ¥, completing the reduction in a single concerted step. Surprisingly, mutation of the Tyr166 does not eliminate enzyme activity but instead changes the product to 3-trans-enoyl-CoA. The current explanation is that Glu164, an acidic residue in the active site, acts as a proton donor to CŒ± when Tyr166 is not present. Function DECR is one of three auxiliary enzymes involved in a rate-limiting step of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. In particular, this enzyme contributes to breaking the double bonds at all even-numbered positions, and some double bonds at odd-numbered position. The structure of the ternary complex of pDCR (peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductases) with NADP and its substrate provides essential and unique insights into the mechanism of catalysis. Unlike other members belonging to the SDR family, catalysis by pDCR does not involve a tyrosine- serine pair. Instead, a catalytically critical aspartate, together with an invariant lysine, polarizes a water molecule to donate a proton for the formation of the product. Although pDCR can use 2,4-hexadienoyl CoA as a substrate, the affinities for short chain fatty acids are lower. Analysis of the hinge movement of DCRs from the mitochondrion and peroxisomes sheds light on the reason behind the unique ability of the peroxisome to shorten very long chain fatty acids. Clinical significance Mutations in the DECR1 gene may result in 2,4 Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency, a rare but lethal disorder. Due to its role in fatty acid oxidation, DECR may serve as a therapeutic target for treating non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which features hyperglycemia due to increased fatty acid oxidation. In knockout mice studies, DECR1‚àí/‚àí subjects accumulate significant concentrations of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the liver during fasting (such as oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid). Mutant subjects were also found to have poor tolerance to cold, decrease in diurnal activity, and an overall reduction in adaptation to metabolic stressors.

Bricks manufactured at the site have been used to construct prominent Canadian buildings such as the Bessborough Hotel in Saskatoon and the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City. The site was designated as a National Historic Site in 1996 and remains one of Canada‚Äôs greatest examples of early twentieth century industrialism. History The land around the Claybank Brick Plant National historic Site has been inhabited by various First Nations groups for thousands of years. While they undoubtedly hunted and gathered in the area, it is also very probable that they utilized the rich clay deposits of the area to produce clay pottery and other tools. Despite a long history of human occupation in the area, it was not until fairly recently, the late nineteen century, that recent European settlers in the area discovered the valuable clay deposits, recognized their economic importance and begun to utilize them on an industrial scale. * 1886 - Discovery: Thomas McWilliams, a homesteader from the Moose Jaw Creek area, was the first to recognize the economic potential of the clay found in hills of this area. He discovered the coal one day in 1886 while out looking for lost cattle and picking Saskatoon berries. Thomas travelled to Moose Jaw to the land titles office to lay claim to the clay-rick land. He later moved his family to the new homestead. Near the same time, he sought permission from the federal government to mine the refractory clay on his land. This is the first official record of the Claybank clay deposits. Over the next, almost twenty years, Thomas minded and sold clay to the Wellington White brick plant in Moose Jaw.Claybank Brick Plant Historical Society URL accessed April 25, 2007 * 1904 - Partnership: In 1904, Thomas entered into a formal partnership with the Moose Jaw Fire Brick and Pottery Company. As a result, the company acquired Mr. McWilliam's original homestead plus other nearby clay deposits. Despite the investment and exceptional quality of the clay, a lack of infrastructure and the distance to consumer markets, made the endeavour unprofitable as Moose Jaw was over 50 km away and the clay had to be hauled by horse and wagon. That, however, was about to change. * 1910 - Development: In 1910, the Canadian Northern Railway came to the area and overnight, the problem of lack of access to markets was resolved. A spur line from the main rail line at Claybank was constructed and plans were immediately made to build a new coal-fired brick plant. In 1912, the Moose Jaw Fire Brick and Pottery Company bought out Tom McWilliams' remaining shares and transformed itself into Saskatchewan Clay Products. The new plant, begun in 1912, was completed in 1914 however, because of the economic difficulties related to World War I, it was forced to cease operations until 1916. * 1916 - Re-organization: The Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products Ltd. was the result of a company re-organization in 1916. The plant was immediately pressed back into service. The newly re-branded and re- energized company expanded its product line to include face brick and specialized fire brick. These new innovate products helped the company survive the immediate post-war years as the expansion of railways and industrialization following the war, meant high demand for the company‚Äôs products. The development of the specialized product line also helped the company survive the Great Depression, to such an extent that by 1938 the Claybank brick plant was the busiest in the province. During World War II demand for the company‚Äôs specialized refractory bricks, used in Corvette warships, ensured its prosperity, while face brick production also continued. In post-war years the Claybank brick plant continued to prosper and by 1950 it was the largest clay plant in Saskatchewan. 1954 - Foreign Control: In 1954 the plant was bought by the Alberta-based, Redcliffe Pressed Brick, who renamed the company, Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products. The following year, controlling interest in the plant was transferred to A.P. Green Fire Brick Company of Mexico, Missouri. The company, one of North America's leading producers of refractory products, modernized the plant's operations, including converting six of the ten coal-fired kilns to natural gas. Despite these improvements the plant began experiencing financial difficulties in the mid-1950s as a result of the decline in the demand for locomotive brick as railways converted to diesel locomotives. In the 1960s, the company also discontinued production of its famous face brick. While the conversion of the kilns to natural gas offered several advantages, it had proved devastating to the demand for Claybank face brick as the coal fired kilns had given the brick its colour - colour that was lost with natural gas. In 1962 A.P. Green gained complete control of the Claybank brick plant but the company continued to operate under the name Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products until December 31, 1970. * 1971 - Decline: In 1971 the plant became a subsidiary of A.P. Green Refractories (Canada) Ltd. This limited the plant's prospects and appears to have hastened the plant's financial decline. Dwindling markets for refractory bricks, changing technology, the plant's outmoded equipment and corporate downsizing all contributed to the closure of the 75 year old plant in 1989. * 1989 - Heritage Property: With the closure of the plant in June 1989 the Government of Saskatchewan decided to designate the plant as a provincial heritage site. A.P. Green donated the brick plant, machinery and equipment to the Saskatchewan Heritage Foundation in 1992. In 1994 the plant was declared a national historic site and in 1998 the Claybank Brick Plant was officially designated as Provincial Heritage Property. The Claybank Brick plant has been conserved as a part of Saskatchewan's industrial heritage with its official announcement June 29, 1997 as a National Historic Site of Canada by Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps. $2 million for the conservation and presentation of the Brick Plant by Claybank was contributed jointly between Federal and Provincial Government funding departments. In 2015, the Saskatchewan Heritage Foundation partnered with the Prince‚Äôs Charities Canada and the Prince‚Äôs Regeneration Trust, philanthropic organizations established by the Prince of Wales, to undertake a review of the operations at Claybank Brick Plant National Historic Site.  Products  Face Brick: The Claybank plant produced a distinctive brick that was used in many prominent buildings across Canada including the Ch√¢teau Frontenac in Quebec City, the Delta Bessborough http://doorsopensaskatoon.com/downtown.html#bess in Saskatoon, the Gravelbourg Cathedral, in Gravelbourg and many courthouses and public buildings throughout Saskatchewan. The face brick was produced until the 1960s before being discontinued. Fire Brick: Claybank is home to deposits of a rare form of refractory clay that has exceptional heat resistant qualities. The rare fire brick produced from this clay, since the 1920s, have been used in fireplaces and furnaces as well as having lined the fire boxes of CN Rail and CP Rail locomotives and the boilers Corvette warships produced during the Second World War. So good was the fire brick produced at Claybank at insulating against extreme heat that it was used in the construction of the NASA rocket launch pads at Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Geology  Nestled in the Dirt Hills of southern Saskatchewan, the Claybank Brick Plant used clay from the nearby Massold Clay Canyons. The Dirt Hills, the result of Pleistocene glacial action, overlay the Whitemud Formation. The Whitemud geological formation, formed in the late Cretaceous period and found throughout the plains of southern Saskatchewan, southeastern and south-central Alberta, is a source of high-quality refractory clay; white kaolinitic and bentonitic clays. Claybank itself is home to two main types of clay; white and grey in colour which possess different properties, valuable in producing bricks for various purposes.  Claybank Brick Plant National Historic Site Activities  The plant is currently open for tours seven days per week from June to end August or possibly longer please call or see website for details and times. Self-guided tours operate all day and special guided tours are available daily at 10:30 and 1:30. In addition, school and group tours are available upon request.

Past events: In 2009 and 2010, the plant was home to the Canada's largest Airsoft event, dubbed Operation: Mason Relic, and will host the event again in 2011. Massold Clay Canyon 3 km Colour Run was held in June of 2018  Massold Clay Canyons  The Massold Clay Canyons are a 256 acre historic and wildlife area adjacent to the Claybank Brick Plant. The Canyons consist of historic clay bits and nature wildlife areas. In 2001, the Claybank Brick Plant and Historical Society bout the land from Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management. The ground lays untouched by the farmer‚Äôs plough and as such, has remained virtually unchanged since the last glacier. There are many plants indigenous to the area and the hills are rich in local prairie wildlife. Hiking is available through the interpretive centre at the Claybank Brick Plant National Historic Site.

The laboratory is an integral part of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences (NERS) department at the University of Michigan (U-M) and is managed by the Applied Nuclear Science Group. The laboratory was renovated in 2017 with a specific goal to accommodate the use of a new DT neutron generator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Model P211) in various open-beam configurations. NSL provides convenient access to high-fidelity monoenergetic and broad-energy neutron sources for basic research, nuclear security and nonproliferation, and other experimental needs. History The NERS department previously managed and used the Ford Nuclear Reactor at the Phoenix Memorial Laboratory. The reactor provided an access to a neutron source for instructional and experimental use. In 2003, the Ford Nuclear Reactor was shut down and decommissioning operations began. A neutron source was still required for educational and research use. In 2004, the NERS Department purchased a DD neutron generator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Model MP320, producing 2.45 MeV with a rate of 106 n/s). A decision was also made to have a dedicated facility for a neutron source, and in 2006, the first deliveries of components for a D711 DT neutron generator from Thermo Electron Corporation (USA) were made to the department. This generator was rated to produce up to 2x1010 n/s at 14.1 MeV, a useful flux for nuclear activation studies. Final installation and operation of the D711 neutron generator commenced in 2007. The original housing for the neutron generator consisted of a prefabricated concrete ‚Äúcave‚Äù. The cave was about 3 m in length and 1.5 m wide and had windows on two sides. The walls were about 35 cm thick. By simulating the cave and surrounding room, it was determined that 2.5 cm of polyethylene lining added to the inside and outside of the cave would help thermalize the neutrons. In addition, another 60-cm thick wall was built of concrete blocks around the entirety of the cave. The floor was also lined with 5 cm of polyethylene to reduce scatter from the floor. This reduced the average dose on the surface of the cave below 10 mRem/hr. ‚ÄúHotspots‚Äù still existed at the points closest to the source, but they were less than 50 mRem/hr, well within the 100 mRem/hr regulation. In 2017, the D711 neutron generator was decommissioned and a new DT neutron generator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Model P211, producing up to 108 n/s at 100 Hz) was acquired with a goal to provide a pulsed neutron source with near-monoenergetic spectrum by operating the unit in open space, far from structural or shielding walls and floor. The NSL was redesigned and renovated to ensure that the dose rates around the laboratory stay within the permissible limits. The renovated NSL provides a convenient access to both monoenergetic (DD/DT) and broad-energy (252Cf) neutron sources to the faculty, staff, and students of University of Michigan. The laboratory also houses various radioisotope gamma sources, detectors, and supporting nuclear instrumentation. 800px P211 DT Neutron Generator The P211 DT Neutron Generator manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific, utilizes the 3H(d,n)4He fusion reactions to produce 14.1 MeV neutrons. A beam of deuterons is accelerated to ~80 keV and bombards a tritium-impregnated target in the generator assembly. The generator is cylindrical in shape and has a rated output of 108 n/s. Individual pulses contain 106 neutrons and can be produced at various repetition rates - from single shot to 100 Hz. The P211 generator is further designed so that no neutrons are produced between pulses. P211 Neutron Generator at the Neutron Science Laboratory Regulatory Limits Safety interlock station at the NSL. The NSL has four such stations having a keypad and a light tree. The State of Michigan of Community Health (MDCH) is the regulatory body to which the design of the NSL must comply. MDCH limits Class AA installations public exposure to be less than 2 mrem/h, measure 5 cm from any accessible external surface point, while the source is operating at maximum radiation output. Therefore, the lab was designed such that the dose rates are less than 2 mrem/h at any point outside of the experimental area with DT generator in operation (since it is the most intense source in the laboratory) The concrete walls were made 3 ft thick according to the guidance from The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Report No. 144, ‚ÄúRadiation Protection for Particle Accelerator Facilities,‚Äù and the MCNP simulations. The walls were made 11 ft tall to permit experiments at various heights of the DT generator. After renovation of the laboratory and installation of safety interlocks, the P211 DT generator was first operated on 28 November 2017. The dose rates were experimentally determined outside of the laboratory walls and were below the permissible limit of 2 mrem/h. On that day, NSL was approved for operation by the U-M Radiation Safety Service.

After earning his degrees, Burton spent the next three years bouncing around, as an assistant coach at Cal Poly, Leigh High School in San Jose, and Westmont High School in Campbell. In 1972, took the head coaching job at Willow Glen High School in San Jose, compiling a 143-52 record in eight seasons there. Burton left Willow Glen in 1980 to become head coach at West Valley College in Saratoga. Burton spent the 1986-87 season as an assistant coach on a Utah team which reached the NIT, but returned to West Valley the next year. In all, he spent 21 years as head coach of West Valley, compiling a record of 488-158. Under Burton, West Valley reached won their conference eight times and reached the state championship three times. Burton was coach of the Year for his conference nine times, and for the entire state of California four times. He had only two losing seasons. Burton left West Valley for good in 2002, to be an assistant coach under Ray Lopes at Fresno State. He was inducted to the California Community Colleges Coaches Hall of Fame in 2004. Cal State Fullerton Burton was named Fullerton's head coach on June 6, 2003, replacing Donny Daniels, who left the program to become an assistant at UCLA. The Titans struggled throughout Burton's first year as they compiled an 11-17 record, even with Pape Sow, (who would go on to the NBA) and Bobby Brown, (who would become the Titans' all-time leading scorer and would also reach the NBA) on the squad. In the 2004-05 season, the team showed vast improvement as Burton's squad went 21-11 and reached the third round of the NIT. The 2005-06 season, the team finished with a disappointing 16-13 record, but they rebounded in 2006-07 for a 20-10 season, marking the first time since 1985 that the Titans had three consecutive winning seasons. Fullerton won the Big West Conference in 2008, tying Santa Barbara and Northridge at 12-4 in the regular season, while winning the conference tournament by defeating UC Irvine in the championship game. The Titans thus earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament as a 14-seed, the programs first appearance in the tournament since 1978. They were defeated by Wisconsin in the first round, 71-56.

The Georgian affair of 1922 () was a political conflict within the Soviet leadership about the way in which social and political transformation was to be achieved in the Georgian SSR. The dispute over Georgia, which arose shortly after the forcible Sovietization of the country and peaked in the latter part of 1922, involved local Georgian Bolshevik leaders, led by Filipp Makharadze and Budu Mdivani, on one hand, and their de facto superiors from the Russian SFSR, particularly Joseph Stalin and Grigol Ordzhonikidze, on the other hand. The content of this dispute was complex, involving the Georgians' desire to preserve autonomy from Moscow and the differing interpretations of Bolshevik nationality policies, and especially those specific to Georgia. One of the main points at issue was Moscow's decision to amalgamate Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan into Transcaucasian SFSR, a move that was staunchly opposed by the Georgian leaders who urged for their republic a full-member status within the Soviet Union. The affair was a critical episode in the power struggle surrounding the sick Vladimir Lenin, whose support Georgians sought to obtain. The dispute ended with the victory of the Stalin-Ordzhonikidze line and resulted in the fall of the Georgian moderate Communist government. It also contributed to a final break between Lenin and Stalin, and inspired Lenin's last major writings.  Background = Marxism and \\"The National Question\\"  In 1848, Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto that \\"the working men have no country,\\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist- manifesto/ch02.htm and over the next several decades Marxist thinkers such as Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, Otto Bauer, Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin would continue to engage with the question of how to relate a class-based worldview to the existence of nations and nationalism, reaching sometimes starkly different conclusions. These questions began to take on an increasingly urgent political character in the aftermath of the overthrow of the government of Tsar Nicholas II and its replacement with the new Soviet government. = Stalin's views on the National Question = In his earliest school years in Georgia, Stalin (born Ioseb Jughashvili) had felt a connection to emerging Georgian nationalism, in part as a reaction against a policy of imperial Russification present in the seminary he attended while studying for the orthodox priesthood.Kotkin, Stephen: Stalin: Paradoxes of Power, Vol. 1, 1878-1928. New York: Penguin Books, 2014. Pgs. 32-35 By 1904, however, influenced by Marxist writings, Stalin had moved toward repudiation of independent Georgian nationalism, as he outlined in his essay The Social- Democratic View on the National Question.https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1904/09/01.htm Stalin developed his views further in his 1913 pamphlet Marxism and the National Question. The essay describes nationalism as an important force to be reckoned with that historically had arisen in tandem with the rise of capitalism and had gained a great deal of momentum in Russian border regions (including Georgia) following the fall of the tsarist autocracy, and attempted to strike a balance between a right of national self-determination as a legitimate response to oppressor chauvinism while also recognizing the potentially exploitative uses of nationalism as a means to divide the working class, to engage in actual oppression, or to cling to what Stalin viewed as outmoded cultural totems (derisively citing \\"such 'national peculiarities' of the Georgians as the vendetta!\\" as an example); similarly, it attempted to strike a balance between adherence to principles and the need to temporize according to particular circumstances.https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03a.htm In the same essay, Stalin specifically describes problems related to \\"cultural-national\\" autonomy in the Caucasus region, including Georgia, referring to the possible organization both within and beyond that territory of ethnically defined institutions, objecting in part that such a project would be bound to failure by the region's kaleidoscopic ethnic diversity and also that it might lead to power-grabs by what he viewed as \\"reactionary\\" religious leaders. By 1917, partly as a result of these efforts, Stalin became the recognized expert within the Russia Bolshevik Party on the National Question, and had risen to position of Commissar of Nationalities in the new Soviet government.Kotkin, pg. 349  Diplomatic Backdrop  The establishment of the new RSFSR in 1917 (and, especially, the conclusion of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War) touched off a flurry of diplomatic activity. Initially, relations between the Russian SFSR and other Soviet Socialist Republics were governed by a series of bilateral treaties, a state of affairs that the top Bolshevik leadership regarded as undesirable and unsustainable over a long period of time. Shortly before the 10th Party Congress in March 1921, Stalin published theses emphasizing his view of the non-viability of bilateral treaties as a long-term solution, writing \\"Not one Soviet republic taken separately can consider itself safe from economic exhaustion and military defeat by world imperialism. Therefore, the isolated existence of separate Soviet republics has no firm basis in view of the threats to their existence from the capitalist states....The national Soviet republics that have freed themselves from their own and from the foreign bourgeoisie will be able to defend their existence and conquer the united forces of imperialism only by joining in a close political union.\\"Kotkin, pg. 386 The terms under which different SSRs might be incorporated into some larger body with the RSFR was, however, the subject of much debate.  Bolshevik Takeover of Georgia  Soviet rule in Georgia was established by the Soviet Red Army during the February‚ÄìMarch 1921 military campaign that was largely engineered by the two influential Georgian-born Soviet officials, Joseph Stalin, then People's Commissar for Nationalities for the RSFSR, and Grigol Ordzhonikidze, head of the Transcaucasian Regional Committee (Zaikkraikom) of the Russian Communist Party. Disagreements among the Bolsheviks about the fate of Georgia preceded the Red Army invasion. While Stalin and Ordzhonikidze urged the immediate Sovietization of independent Georgia led by the Menshevik-dominated government, Trotsky favored \\"a certain preparatory period of work inside Georgia, in order to develop the uprising and later come to its aid\\". Lenin was unsure about the outcome of the Georgian campaign, fearful of the international consequences and the possible crisis with Kemalist Turkey. Lenin finally gave his consent, on February 14, 1921, to the intervention in Georgia, but later repeatedly complained about the lack of precise and consistent information from the Caucasus.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, pp. 210-212. Indiana University Press, Well aware of widespread opposition to the newly established Soviet rule, Lenin favored a reconciliatory policy with Georgian intelligentsia and peasants who remained hostile to the militarily imposed regime. However, many Communists found it difficult to abandon the methods used against their opposition during the Russian Civil War and make adjustment to the more flexible policy. For moderates like Filipp Makharadze, Lenin's approach was a reasonable way to secure for Soviet power a broad base of support. They advocated tolerance toward the Menshevik opposition, greater democracy within the party, gradual land reform and, above all, respect for national sensitivities and Georgia's sovereignty from Moscow. Communists like Ordzhonikidze and Stalin pursued a more hard-line policy: they sought to eliminate completely political opposition and centralize party control over the newly Sovietized republics.Knight, Ami W. (1993), Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant, p . 26-27. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, Conflict soon broke out between the moderate and hard-line Georgian Bolshevik leaders. The dispute was preceded by Stalin's ban on formation of the national Red Army of Georgia, and subordination of all local workers' organizations and trade unions to the Bolshevik party committees. Dissatisfied by the Soviet Georgian government's moderate treatment of the political opposition and its desire to retain sovereignty from Moscow, Stalin arrived in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, in early July 1921. After summoning a workers' assembly, Stalin delivered a speech outlining a program aimed at elimination of local nationalism, but was booed by the crowd and received hostile silence from his colleagues.Lang, David Marshall (1962). A Modern History of Georgia, p. 238. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Within the days that followed, Stalin removed the Georgian Revolutionary committee chief Makharadze for inadequate firmness and replaced him with Polikarp Mdivani, ordering local leaders to \\"crush the hydra of nationalism\\". Makharadze's supporters, including the Georgian Cheka chief Kote Tsintsadze and his lieutenants, were also sacked and replaced with more ruthless officers Kvantaliani, Atarbekov, and Lavrentiy Beria.  Conflict over confederation  Within less than a year, however, Stalin was in open conflict with Mdivani and his associates. One of the most important points at issue was the question of Georgia's status in the projected union of Soviet republics. Over the objections of other Georgian Bolsheviks, Grigol Ordzhonikidze in late 1921 had set in motion the formation of a union of all three Transcaucasian republics‚ÄîArmenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia‚Äîas a means of resolving simmering territorial and ethnic disputes, and with Stalin's strong backing insisted that this federation join the Soviet Union together as one federative republic. The Georgian Central Executive Committee, particularly Mdivani, vehemently disagreed with this proposal, desiring their country to retain a stronger individual identity and enter the union as a full member rather than as part of a single Transcaucasian SFSR. (Ordzhonikidze's proposal, however, was passed at a Georgian Party Congress with support of rank-and-file delegates.)Kotkin, pg. 479 Stalin and his aides accused the Georgian Central Executive Committee of selfish nationalism and labeled them as \\"national deviationists\\". On their part, the Georgian Central Executive Committee responded with charges of \\"Great Russian chauvinism\\". On October 21, 1922, Mdivani contacted Moscow to berate Ordzhonikidze in harsh terms. The same day, Lenin sent a telegram rebuking Mdivani, upholding Stalin's position, and expressing his strong support for the political and economic integration of the Transcaucasian republics, informing the Georgian leaders that he rejected their criticism of Moscow's bullying tactics. The conflict peaked in November 1922, when Ordzhonikidze resorted to physical violence with a member of the Mdivani group and struck him during a verbal confrontation.Kort, M (2001), The Soviet Colossus, p.154. M.E. Sharpe, The Georgian leaders complained to Lenin and presented a long list of abuses, including the notorious incident involving Ordzhonikidze.  Lenin's involvement  In late November 1922, Lenin dispatched the VeCheka chief Dzerzhinsky to Tiflis to investigate the matter. Dzerzhinsky sympathized with Stalin and Ordzhonikidze and, hence, tried to give Lenin a significantly smoothened picture of their activities in his report. However, Lenin's doubts about the conduct of Stalin and his allies around the Georgian question mounted. He was also afraid of negative outcry that might ensue abroad and in other Soviet republics. In late December 1922, Lenin accepted that both Ordzhonikidze and Stalin were guilty of the imposition of Great Russian nationalism upon non-Russian nationalities.Thatcher, Ian D. (2003), Trotsky, p. 122. Routledge, Nevertheless, Lenin's misgivings over the Georgian problem were not fundamental and, as his health deteriorated, the Georgian leaders were left without any major ally, watching Georgia being pressed into the Transcaucasian federation that signed a treaty with the Russian SFSR, Ukraine and Belarus, joining them all in a new Soviet Union on December 30, 1922.Alan Ball, 'Building a new state and society: NEP, 1921-1928', in: R.G. Suny, The Cambridge History of Russia, vol. III: The Twentieth Century (Cambridge 2006), p. 175. The Politburo decision of 25 January 1923 concerning the removal of Mdivani and his associates from Georgia represented a conclusive victory for Ordzhonikidze and his backers.  Conflicting accounts of Lenin's reaction  Lenin's reaction following Ordzhonikidze's takeover is a matter of dispute revolving around attribution of three letters and one Pravda article. In one telling, on March 5, 1923, Lenin broke off personal relations with Stalin. He attempted to enlist Leon Trotsky to take over the Georgian problem, and began preparing three notes and a speech, where he would announce to the Party Congress that Stalin would be removed as General Secretary.McNeal, Robert H. (1959), Lenin's Attack on Stalin: Review and Reappraisal, American Slavic and East European Review, 18 (3): 295-314 However, on March 9, 1923, Lenin suffered a third stroke, which would eventually lead to his death. Trotsky declined to confront Stalin on the issue probably due to his long-held prejudice against Georgia as a Menshevik stronghold. At the 12th Party Congress in April 1923, the Georgian Communists found themselves isolated. With Lenin's notes suppressed, every word uttered from the platform against Georgian or Ukrainian nationalism was greeted with stormy applause, while the mildest allusion to Great Russian chauvinism was received in stony silence.Lang (1962), p. 243. Thus Lenin's illness, Stalin's increasing influence in the party and his ascent toward full power, and the sidelining of Leon Trotsky led to the marginalization of the decentralist forces within the Georgian Communist Party.Cornell, Svante E. (2002), Autonomy and Conflict: Ethnoterritoriality and Separatism in the South Caucasus ‚Äì Case in Georgia , pp. 141-144. Department of Peace and Conflict Research, University of Uppsala, Recent scholarship, however, has challenged the authenticity of the source materials involved in reaching this conclusion.Kotkin, pgs. 482-93 Over December 15‚Äì16, 1922, Lenin's condition had worsened, which left him unable to write ever again, and he relied instead on dictation.Kotkin, pg. 483 Two days later, the Central Committee voted to restrict contact between Lenin and other Soviet leaders; six days after that, it voted to restrict the time Lenin would be allowed to spend each day on dictation to 5‚Äì10 minutes, adding that \\"this cannot have the character of correspondence, and [Lenin] may not expect to receive any answers.\\" These restrictions were aimed at helping Lenin to recuperate, but they became instead a source of deep distress. Trotsky claims to have received a cordial letter from Lenin dated December 21, but the original has never been found.Kotkin, pg. 484 On January 25, 1923, the Central Committee met to hear the findings of the Dzerzhinsky report, and voted to endorse them. In accordance with the restrictions they had earlier approved, Lenin was not present and was forbidden from receiving this report. Distressed by this state of affairs, Lenin had requested the previous day that a copy of the report be obtained so that his personal secretariat could study it. Around this time, Stalin, who had been voted in charge of official access to Lenin, had a sharp dispute over the telephone with Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, over his refusal to turn over the materials. The dispute left Krupskaya livid with Stalin and both sides began to feel concern about intrigue. Krupskaya would eventually obtain the dossier and a report would be prepared for Lenin. The picture painted by this counter-dossier, however, was sharply different from that painted by the original, as it omitted details that made the harsh reaction to the Georgian Central Executive Committee appear more reasonable. On March 6, a telegram supposedly authored by Lenin addressed to Mdivani and Makharadze offered them his strong support against the \\"conniving\\" of Stalin and Dzerzhinsky. On the same day, however, Lenin's physicians recorded that \\"When he awoke, he summoned a nurse, but he could almost not converse with her, he wanted the nurse the summon Nadezhda Konstantinova [Krupskaya, Lenin's wife], but he could not say her name.... [Lenin] is agitated, he tries to speak, but cannot find the words...\\"Kotkin, pg. 490 An article supposedly written by Lenin‚Äîdespite his having lost nearly all communicative faculty‚Äîappeared in an April issue of Pravda, appearing to support Trotsky's position on Georgia at the expense of Stalin. Regarding the authorship of the friendly letter to Trotsky, the conciliatory telegram to Makharov and Mdivani, the counter-dossier, and the Pravda article, numerous signs point to the conclusion that they were fabricated in part or whole by Krupskaya, possibly as a result of a falling out between her and Stalin.  Aftermath  The affair held back the careers of the Georgian Old Bolsheviks, but Ordzhonikidze's reputation also suffered and he was soon recalled from the Caucasus. Mdivani and his associates were removed to minor posts, but they were not actively attacked until the late 1920s. Most of them were later executed during the Great Purge of the 1930s. Another major consequence of the defeat of Georgian \\"national deviationists\\" was the intensification of political repressions in Georgia, leading to an armed rebellion in August 1924 and the ensuing Red Terror, which took several thousands of lives.

It was published by Atlus (Japan and North America) in 2007, and by Square Enix (Europe) in 2008. A remake, titled Odin Sphere Leifthrasir, was released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in 2016: Atlus handled publishing duties in Japan and North America, while NIS America published the title in PAL territories. Using a two-dimensional side-scrolling perspective, gameplay focuses on a beat em up-style fighting system while incorporating role-playing elements ‚Äî Leifthrasir expands upon and refines these elements. The story, shared between both versions, follows five characters on the fantasy continent of Erion during a war between the nations of Ragnanival and Ringford over a weapon called the Crystallization Cauldron, and their roles in the Armageddon, a catastrophe which will destroy Erion. The game was conceived by George Kamitani as first a sequel and then a spiritual successor to the 1997 Sega Saturn title Princess Crown. Development began in 2004 after the official formation of Vanillaware. The story was based around the concept of a Valkyrie princess. The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes as if on a stage rather than using traditional cinematography. Leifthrasir began development in 2013 as a means of addressing the issues both players and staff had with the original game while keeping the story intact. The music for both versions was composed by a team from Basiscape, led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto. Prior to Atlus picking up the title, Vanillaware had encountered difficulties finding a publisher due to Kamitani's sparse record as a developer. Completed in 2006, Odin Sphere was delayed into the following year so it would not compete with Atlus' own titles. The localization was handled by Atlus USA, and proved challenging in multiple areas. Upon release, it garnered a positive reception from video game journalists: praise was given to its story, visuals and old-school gameplay, with criticism focused on its inventory system and framerate issues. Leifthrasir was praised for its improved performance and reworked mechanics. The game was a commercial success, contributing to the rise of Vanillaware as a developer. Gameplay Odin Sphere is a two- dimensional (2D) side-scrolling action role-playing game where the player takes control of five different characters across six playable scenarios. Areas within levels are circular stages allowing movement left or right with exits leading to other areas; the main goal in each area is to eliminate all enemies and proceed to the next area. Combat‚Äîwhich uses a beat em up-style battle system‚Äîtakes place within these areas, and revolves around the player character using a combination of physical attacks and Psypher skills, skills tied to each character's magical weapon. Combination attacks are triggered by attacking enemies continuously. Jumping can be used to reach airborne enemies within stages. At the end of each battle, grades are awarded based on the battle time, damage taken from enemies, and the amount of damage dealt. The amount of in-game currency the player receives as a reward after each battle depends on the battle grade. Rather than the typical experience point-driven character growth of most role-playing games, each characters' abilities is linked to their Psyphers, and the amount of damage characters can inflict depends upon the strength of their Psypher. These two elements are upgraded by collecting Phozons, spirit energy released from defeated enemies. Phozons fill a magic meter, which is used to trigger special skills. All physical attacks drain a character's POW (power) gauge, and if depleted entirely the character must rest until the gauge refills. Tied to Phozons and leveling is a farming system, where seeds planted and fueled with Phozons provide meals which raise a character's level, boosting their health and abilities. Food can be grown in the wild using seeds, but later two restaurants are available where prepared meals can be eaten. Various elements, such as food and material, can be used together using an Alchemy system which allows for the creation of potions with various effects, from dealing damage to healing the main character. Leifthrasir adds to and augments the existing features. These include new battle arenas, and new vertical areas within environments to create platforming segments. Characters now have exclusive abilities and elemental affinities, such as Gwendolyn having access to ice attacks. Battle rankings now depend upon skills used and time taken rather than a quick clearing of arenas, with items as well as money being awarded for high scores. The POW system is redesigned so that only special attacks consume POW with the exception of one character. Some special attacks also consumes portion of phozons collected in battle. Each character also possesses skill and ability trees, which are unlocked with Phozons stored during and after battles. While skill trees are unlocked with Phozons, abilities are upgraded with Ability Points. The food and growing systems remain roughly similar, while the Alchemy system is streamlined. Leifthrasir also includes a \\"Classic\\" mode, which switches from the redesigned look of Leifthrasir to the original version. Synopsis=Setting and characters Odin Sphere is set on the fictional continent of Erion, which is divided into multiple nations scattered across the land. The two main nations are the warrior land of Ragnanival, and the forest-bound Fairy Kingdom of Ringford, separated by a wasteland that was once the kingdom of Valentine. At the game's opening, Ragnanival is ruled by the Demon Lord , and Ringford is ruled by the Fairy Queen with help from her nephew . The other nations include the neutral land of Titania; the volcano- bound Fire Kingdom ruled by the one male resident King ; and the Netherworld, the land of the dead where natural crystals grow, ruled by the undead Queen . Two key elements in the game are psyphers, weapons incorporating crystals made from phozon life energy; and the Crystallization Cauldron, a weapon created by Valentine that crafts crystals by absorbing phozons from the land. A driving force of the plot is the tale of the Armageddon, a foretold catastrophe in which Erion is destroyed and the survivors rule the new world. Many years prior to the game's events, the world was controlled by King , who ruled the kingdom bearing his name. Originally a kind man, a spell to bring his people prosperity drained his goodness, causing him to turn into a vicious dictator who declared war on the rest of Erion. During his conquests, the Cauldron went wild and destroyed the kingdom in a single night ‚Äî everyone was cursed and transformed into Pookas, while Valentine's kingdom was reduced to a wasteland. In the aftermath of Valentine's fall, Ragnanival and Ringford had become Erion's most powerful nations, while the other nations have become weak in comparison. At the game's opening, Ragnanival and Ringford are at war over possession of the Cauldron in the wasteland of Valentine, as each see the Cauldron as too dangerous for the other to possess. The story is told from the perspective of a young girl named Alice reading a series of books in her attic, with five initial storylines or \\"books\\" playing out between the five main characters and overlapping at multiple points. The five main protagonists are , a Valkyrie and daughter to the Demon Lord Odin who has lived for years in the shadow of her sister ; , the prince of Titania turned into a Pooka; , daughter of Elfaria and later the reluctant queen of Ringford; the \\"Shadow Knight\\" , a dark knight in service to Ringford who was found abandoned as a baby and adopted by Melvin; and , a survivor from the Kingdom of Valentine who hides her identity as Odin's illegitimate daughter and has been dubbed the \\"Forest Witch\\". Other key characters outside the royalty of Erion's surviving nations include the Three Wise Men, a group manipulating Erion's nations to fulfill the ancient prophecies surrounding the Armageddon; , Velvet's brother who like Velvet retained his humanity and was key to the disaster that consumed his kingdom; and King Valentine, having escaped the Netherworld as an insane revenant bent on destroying Erion. Plot The game's opening sees Ringford holding the Cauldron and its controlling ring Titrel, having been given Titrel by Ingway as part of his vengeance against Odin. Elfaria is ultimately killed by Odin, who takes Titrel from her. Velvet steals it in turn and gives it to the dragon Wagner, hoping that this would prevent the Cauldron being used. Her lover Cornelius is meanwhile changed into a Pooka by Ingway and thrown into the Netherworld, escaping with the aid of his grandfather Gallon. He learns that the people of Valentine share his curse, and is embroiled in both the Pookas' efforts to collect wish-granting coins to reverse their condition and his attempts to save Velvet from danger. The Three Wise Men are attempting to fulfill the prophecies of the Armageddon ‚Äî all but one Wise Man are killed during the course of the story, while the third Beldor is afflicted with the Pooka's curse and gains subsequent immortality. Cornelius rescues Velvet from their clutches, and despite his fears she reaffirms her love for him in his new form. Several characters also encounter King Valentine, who continues to be tormented by memories of murdering Velvet's mother in a rage ‚Äî as part of his scheme to trigger the Armageddon, he hatches the dragon Leventhan. Gwyndolyn's story focuses on the time after her sister Griselda is killed in battle ‚Äî having always come second in her father's eyes, Gwyndolyn tries hard to impress him, but must ultimately defy him when his general Brigan attempts to undermine him. Gwyndolyn is placed in an enchanted sleep for her defiance, to be woken and fall in love with the first man who kisses her. After being spirited to the lands of Onyx by the Three Wise Men, Gwyndolyn's story becomes intertwined with Oswald's. Oswald is involved in an attempted coup against Mercedes by Melvin and is taken by Odette as payment for the power Melvin infused into Oswald's psypher. He is then used by Odin to take Titrel from Wagner by force, but ultimately rebels and rescues Gwyndolyn from Onyx after learning that Odin did not enchant her, giving Titrel to the awoken Gwyndolyn as a gift. Gwyndolyn, initially defiant, begins to fall in love, but is tricked into giving Titrel to Odin. Feeling betrayed, Oswald allows Odette to take him. Mercedes' story runs parallel to the others, chronicling her efforts to become queen in the wake of her mother's death and Melvin's attempted coup, aided by Ingway after he is turned into a frog by the Three Wise Men. With the help of the dwarf smith Brom, she refashions her psypher into a weapon powerful enough to destroy Odin's psypher, winning a battle against him and taking Titrel. She also breaks Ingway's curse, and the two grow attached to each other. Titrel is subsequently stolen by Gwyndolyn, who uses it as a bargaining chip to rescue Oswald from Odette, who is killed by Gwyndolyn. Initially torn between love for Oswald and duty to Odin, Gwyndolyn defies her father and leaves with Oswald and Titrel, which now acts as a symbol of their love. Odin is then accosted by Ingway and Velvet; Ingway transforms into a monster in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Odin, then Velvet and Ingway are rescued by Cornelius. The sixth book shows the advent of Armageddon ‚Äî King Valentine activates the Cauldron and uses it to absorb phozons from the land to feed the growth of Leventhan. Ingway attempts to destroy the Cauldron using his cursed form, but he falls under the control of Beldor, who has also led the monstrous Gallon and the Netherworld army into Erion. In the ensuing chaos, Odin is killed, and Onyx decides to destroy Ringford to avert a prophecy of his death at the \\"World Tree\\". The story then divides between the main characters' battles in the wake of these events, with different endings playing out depending on who is matched with which battle; Erion's rebirth or absolute destruction depending on whether or not the choices are correct. In the canon series of events, Cornelius defeats Ingway and Beldor and is rescued by Velvet, who learns from the dying Ingway that the Cauldron can be used to reverse the destruction; Oswald defeats Gallon, learning that he is Gallon's grandson by his banished son Edgar and thus Titanian royalty; Mercedes, whose true name is \\"Yggdrasil\\" (World Tree), finds Ingway's corpse and dies in battle after fatally wounding Onyx; Velvet stops the Cauldron without destroying its core, but King Valentine curses the Cauldron before waking Leventhan and killing himself by jumping into its path; and Gwyndolyn kills Leventhan before it can destroy Erion, losing her wings in the process. Having finished the books, Alice finds a magical coin on the front cover of the sixth book. Called downstairs by her mother, she misses seeing Cornelius and Velvet, both in Pooka form, take the coin and leave a seventh book. In this book, Gwyndolyn is rescued by Oswald, who carries her to the Cauldron before collapsing. Velvet and Cornelius are there, and Velvet finds Titrel on Gwyndolyn's hand. Using Titrel, Velvet turns their psyphers back into phozons to power the Cauldron and revives the land, turning into a Pooka due to Valentine's curse. Oswald and Gwyndolyn bear witness to the rebirth of the land, and become the ancestors to the new humanity; Mercedes is reincarnated as its World Tree. In a special ending set thousands of years after the events of Odin Sphere, Cornelius and Velvet have successfully gathered all the coins and use their combined power to break their curse. A post-credits scene shows an unseen author, who is writing a book called \\"Odin Sphere\\", talking with a merchant while the main characters pass by. A new scene in Leifthrasir shows Ingway's spirit resting within the World Tree's roots, reunited with the reincarnated Mercedes. Development Odin Sphere was the brainchild of George Kamitani, a video game designer who had worked on Princess Crown, a 1997 Japan-exclusive side-scrolling action RPG developed by Atlus for the Sega Saturn. The game was developed by Vanillaware, a studio created by former Atlus staff including Kamitani to create successor projects to Princess Crown. Initially founded as \\"Puraguru\\" in 2002 when it worked on Fantasy Earth: Zero, the company changed its name in 2004 when the staff moved to Kansai. It was during his time working on Fantasy Earth: Zero that Kamitani met the founding members of Vanillaware. Odin Sphere, which began development in 2004, was designed as a spiritual successor to Princess Crown, specifically evolving the multi-layered narrative style of the original game. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, one of the founding members of Vanillaware. The producer was Atlus staff member Akiyasu Yamamoto. According to Ohnishi, the project started as a direct sequel to Princess Crown, but later became a spiritual successor which incorporated multiple nods to the original game. The reason it changed was that the initial plan for the Princess Crown sequel was to have used 3D visuals, which would have looked wrong with Kamitani's character designs and artwork. Development was difficult for the team due to its small size and hardware difficulties when trying to fit high-quality artwork onto the PlayStation 2 (PS2), resulting in compromises in the visual quality the team had initially planned for the project. This pressure lasted right up to release, as Ohnishi needed to do emergency work to fix game-breaking bugs. Development was completed in 2006. Vanillaware had great difficulty securing a publisher and the necessary funding for the project, as Kamitani's last project had been the unsuccessful Princess Crown over seven years before. They made unsuccessful pitches to multiple publishers before the title was finally accepted by Atlus, although there was some doubt as to whether it would prove a success. While the game was completed in 2006, Atlus delayed its release into 2007 as they did not want it to cannibalize the market for their other titles, particularly Persona 3. Odin Sphere was first revealed in February 2007, three months prior to release. Odin Sphere eventually released on May 17, 2007. Scenario and design The initial concept for Odin Sphere was of a story revolving around a Valkyrie princess, inspired by Kamitani's wish to emulate the protagonist of Princess Crown and hearing at second hand about planning at tri-Ace for Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria, which involved Norse mythology and featured a princess as its main protagonist. Kamitani's Valkyrie protagonist, who would become Gwyndolin, was created before the rest of the game's world and story were finalized. Working from this initial idea and its roots in Norse mythology, Kamitani began writing a romantic storyline for Gwyndolin and Oswald as the central narrative, basing it on Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner. He then added further elements inspired by the works of William Shakespeare and traditional European fairy tales. The other narratives focused on different themes: Mercedes' storyline focused on her maturation into a queen, Velvet's story focused on resolving a mystery, while Cornelius' story narrative modeled after traditional fairy tales as a homage to the early PC game Marchen Veil. As with his other projects, Kamitani included strong female characters, as he felt a woman pushed into summoning the courage to fight deserved victory. There were plans to create backstory elements for characters like Odin and an extra book focusing on Ingway, but the negative impact those elements would have resulted in them being cut. Originally planned to have just an hour and a half of voiced dialogue, the final total was over five hours. Kamitani acted as art and character designer for the game, with additional art for elements such as food provided by Shigatake. So as to distance the appearance of Gwyndolin and other Valkyries in Odin Sphere from the Valkyries of the Valkyrie Profile series, Kamitani modeled their outfits after ballet tutus. The character Mercedes was a fairy version of Gradriel De Valendia, the main protagonist of Princess Crown. Velvet's design was described as an \\"Arabic Little Red Riding Hood\\". More sensual elements of his female character designs came about through chance rather than deliberate design. Despite the general move to 3D graphics in the gaming industry, the team decided to use 2D graphics, as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating. The use of 2D graphics meant that traditional cinematographic camera work for cutscenes was impossible to achieve, so the team instead modeled them after scenes from a stage production. This style was also chosen due to the story's Shakespearean atmosphere. The character graphics were hand-drawn in a process Kamitani dubbed \\"tebineri\\", or hand- shaping. The toolset used to create the graphic animations was heavily inspired by the similar animation style used for Adobe Flash products. An element that proved troublesome was character movement, which was hard to make behave within the limited hardware specifications of the PS2. A cited example was how Velvet's breasts jiggle slightly when she stops moving. This was intended for more female characters, but due to the hardware limitations it was restricted to Velvet. Localization The game was localized for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such as for the Persona series, the team tried to stay faithful to the original text. This proved easier than for the Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes that would not be understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio that was still little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team were told that the game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl reading books. For his part, Meeker read King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements. The localization proved more challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles were designed to use Japanese kanji characters‚Äîwhich compress a lot of information into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet‚Äîeach text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality. Odin Sphere released in North America on May 22, 2007, less than a week after the game's Japanese release. In Europe, it was released on March 14, 2008 by Square Enix. Available with in- game text in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian, it was the first non-Square Enix title the company released in Europe. The European version also included technical improvements that allowed the game to run better than the North American version. It was also published in Australia on March 13. The Japanese voice track was included in the game as a special extra feature for fans of anime. The localization process was timed so that the Japanese and North American releases were days apart rather than months, which put extra pressure due to some promotional assets still being in development in Japan. Odin Sphere Leifthrasir Odin Sphere Leifthrasir, a remake of Odin Sphere for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, began development in late 2013 alongside publisher Atlus changing ownership from Index Corporation to Sega. Ohnishi acted as the remake's director, while Kamitani produced. Atlus initially wanted to create a followup to Vanillaware's recent successful title Dragon's Crown, but when Odin Sphere came up in conversations, it was decided to work on that as it was both Vanillaware's first project and their first Atlus-published title. Initially planned to be an upgraded port, the availability of development resources allowed for the development of a full remake. The aim by Vanillaware was to keep the well-received story and visual design intact, while improving the RPG elements and ironing out technical issues that were criticized at the time. The game's title Leifthrasir was in reference to L√≠f and L√≠f√ærasir, the two humans in Norse mythology who survive Ragnarok and repopulate the new world. The \\"Leifthrasir\\" spelling was chosen over the more common \\"Lifthrasir\\" as the former sounded better. It was also written with the Old Norse letter \\"√æ\\" incorporated into the title. There were a large number of changes made to the game. Additional stages and divisions between battle and exploration were created; defense and dodge actions were added for characters; extensive vertical plains were added to environments; enemy and boss AI was redesigned and refined; additional enemies and subbosses were included; a new difficulty level was added; and the POW gauge, inventory and Psypher systems were redesigned. At the time Odin Sphere was made, it was fully intended to be a successor to Princess Crown, but Vanillaware had since become better known for fast-paced action over simple side-scrolling combat. The gameplay was thus adjusted so that it would be familiar to players of the later and more refined Muramasa: The Demon Blade and Dragon's Crown. Kamitani later commented that he would have made extensive changes such as removing the alchemy system, but other staff members‚Äîwho were fans of Odin Sphere and were employed after the game's release‚Äîsuccessfully pushed to retain and improve rather than remove the original features. According to Ohnishi, how to adjust the gameplay was difficult for the team to decide: elements included the way health and magic energies were raised separately, and how the alchemy system worked. With this in mind, these systems were adjusted so they would be more accessible for people with varied playing styles. The revamped system drew from the team's work on Dragon's Crown. There was no original story content created, although additional text archives were created and the existing text was rewritten in places. The ability to skip story sequences, unavailable in the original release, was included. It was also decided not to have the different sections be playable out of order, as that would negatively impact the story. The high-definition upgrade was not as difficult as it might have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces on either side of the central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out. Leifthrasir was first announced in July 2015, along with its planned release platforms. The game was published in Japan on January 14, 2016. In North America, it released on June 7. While minimal work was done by Atlus' localization team for the remake, the amateur voice acting was replaced with professional performances. In Europe, it was published on June 24 by NIS America. NIS America also published Leifthrasir on June 24 in Australia and New Zealand. Leifthrasir ended up being the last title published during the partnership between Atlus and NIS America, with the two parting following NIS America's growing dissatisfaction with Atlus' behavior with publishing partners since being purchased by Sega. Music The music of Odin Sphere was composed by a team from music company Basiscape. The team was led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto, and included Masaharu Iwata, Mitsuhiro Kaneda, Kimihiro Abe and Manabu Namiki. Sakimoto and Iwata created the majority of the soundtrack. Kamitani brought Basiscape and Sakimoto aboard as they had struck up an acquaintance while working on Fantasy Earth: Zero. He supported Kamitani's team during the more troubling periods of production. When Odin Sphere began development, Kamitani contacted Basiscape at once. The team worked from the concept of Norse mythology interpreted by Japanese, aiming for musical impact rather than cultural accuracy. The aim was to emulate the game's Shakespearean inspiration and evoke the feeling of opening a Harry Potter novel for the first time. The music production took two to three years overall. When creating the music, particularly the main theme, Sakimoto tried to capture the feelings of the characters struggling to determine their futures and face the truth of their situations. The Celtic- styled \\"Shanachie\\" version, which played during the end credits, was performed by Kansai-based band Shanachie. Kaneda created the boss track \\"A Hard Fight and then Hope\\", wanting a theme that was indicative of the main characters fighting beings larger than them. Commenting on his track \\"The Hero's Triumphant Return\\", Iwata aimed at creating a hopeful and triumphant song for key story segments. The main theme's lyrics were written by Nami Uehara, who arranged the main theme's \\"Shanachie\\" version. It was translated into French by Maryvonne Nagel Okamoto. All versions of the main theme were sung by Noriko Kawahara. Odin Sphere Original Soundtrack released on October 14, 2007 by Five Records. Additional orchestral arrangements included on the disk were performed by Eminence Symphony Orchestra. A reprint was issued by Basiscape Records on April 18, 2012. Upon release, it reached #171 in the Oricon charts, remaining in the charts for one week. The album received positive reviews from music critics. Leifthrasir made use of rearranged pieces, in addition to new tracks. These new tracks, 25 in all, were created for the new battle arenas. The music was composed by Sakimoto, Kaneda, Iwata, Abe, Namiki, Kazuki Higashihara, Azusa Chiba and Yoshimi Kudo. Uehara returned as arranger alongside Sakimoto, Kaneda, Iwata, Kudo, Higashihara and Chiba. During his work on the project, Sakimoto felt that the score needed minimal adjustment despite it being ten years since it was created. Shanachie returned to perform a rearranged version of the theme song. Vocals this time were performed by Rena and Miwa Horio. Odin Sphere Leifthrasir Original Soundtrack released on January 14, 2016. In addition to the songs included in Leifthrasir, the soundtrack included five additional remixes of existing themes. Reception Odin Sphere scored 83/100 on the aggregate site Metacritic based on 49 reviews, denoting a generally positive reception and being the 7th best- reviewed PS2 game of the year. Editors of Famitsu Weekly magazine gave the Japanese version a 32 out of 40 cumulative score, earning it the publication's Silver Award, with critics praising the title's graphics and \\"intuitive\\" controls, but also remarked that its difficulty was high and many areas of the game looked too similar. Play Magazine awarded it a perfect score, stating that \\"In the case of Odin Sphere, [we are] confident that this is a perfect game, and that anyone who comes to it will derive the same,\\" praising its 2D graphics, detailed storyline, and unique combat system as high points. Western reviewers generally praised the game highly: the story was cited as both compelling and well-told, with it being compared to the works of Shakespeare and the A Song of Ice and Fire book series. The gameplay systems and controls were generally praised, but while crisisms was laid upon elements of repetition in its combat and progression, and its inventory system. The graphics were unanimously praised, with many comparing it to classic storybooks. A recurring criticism was slow-down during crowded battle sequences. The PS4 version of Leifthrasir received an aggregate score of 87/100 based on 49 reviews, becoming the 15th best-reviewed title of 2016. The Vita version received a score of 93/100 based on five reviews. Reviewing Leifthrasir, Famitsu praised the increased smoothness and battle frequency, noting that the title still felt fresh despite being the remake of a 2007 title. They also praised the graphical upgrade and its effect on the artwork. Critics generally agreed that Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its technical performance, lack of the original's framerate problems, graphical upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation. Sales In its debut week in Japan, Odin Sphere sold 59,248 units, reaching #3 in the charts. It went up to second place in the charts the following week. Sales capped out at 96,280 units in the region by the end of 2007. Upon release in North America, the game reached the top of sales charts and remained there into the following week. It was among the top 20 best-selling titles in North America during its debut month, and was the only title in that ranking not to be a sequel or belong to an established brand. Upon its release as a PS2 Classic on the PlayStation Network in October 2011, the game was the best-selling out of five concurrent releases including God Hand, and reached #15 in the PSN charts for that month. According to a later statement by Atlus' parent company, Odin Sphere had sold 350,000 units worldwide during the 2007 to 2008 period, placing it among the PS2's \\"Greatest Hits\\" line. The financial success of the game for Vanillaware was contributed by Kamitani to high royalty payments set by Atlus as part of the publishing contract. As of 2015, the game has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. Leifthrasir reached the top of sales charts, claiming the spot Monster Hunter Generations which had held the position for three weeks on end. Sales were strong compared to the original version: selling 43,394 units on PlayStation Vita at #1, 42,263 units on PlayStation 4 at #2, and 9,771 units on PlayStation 3 at #10. All version of Leifthrasir sold a total of 95,428, and marked an improvement in sales for Atlus after low sales for Tokyo Mirage Sessions ‚ôØFE the previous month. Upon release in Western territories, the Vita version reached #2 on the PSN chart. Awards Odin Sphere became the recipient of several website and magazine distinctions, particularly during IGN's \\"Best of 2007\\" PlayStation 2 awards, where the game won \\"Best Artistic Design\\", \\"Best Story\\", \\"Most Innovative Design\\", and \\"Best RPG\\". It was a runner-up in the PlayStation 2 categories for \\"Best Original Score\\" and \\"PS2 Game of the Year\\", additionally earning its developer Vanillaware \\"Best Developer\\" along with GrimGrimoire, also released in 2007. It was favorably mentioned by multiple editors in RPGFan's \\"Games of 2007\\" awards, while it was in third place for the 2007 RPGamer Award for best PS2 title behind GrimGrimoire and Persona 3. The game also won GamesRadar's \\"Pure Beauty\\" award during their Platinum Chalice Awards, with the website remarking that \\"The graphics here are so artistic it's hypnotic, if not literally breathtaking.\\" Legacy The delayed release of Odin Sphere led to issues with the company: they needed to start other projects to keep their company going, leading to the development of GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire drained the company's funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding new publishers as Atlus refused to take any more of Vanillaware's products until they had seen how Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.

He was purged under Joseph Stalin as a member of the Left Opposition within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Tsintsadze joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1904, and sided with its Bolshevik faction. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he was closely associated with the famous revolutionary fighter Kamo and served as head of the Bolshevik armed detachments that engaged in expropriation and robbery organised in the Manganese mine of Chiatura. He organised a group of female student-revolutionaries (who were in love with him) to rob banks.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 112 In 1906 he took part in the execution of traitors after the Bolshevik battle squads were driven out of the cities. On February 16, 1906, Tsintsadze took part in the assassination of Commander in chief of the Caucasus, General Fyodor Griiazanov (nicknamed General Shitheap). Joseph Stalin commissioned the hitmen who pretended to be painting a nearby gate. They threw grenades at his carriage and blew him to pieces.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 127 Then Stalin commissioned him to set up the Druzhina (outfit) or Bolshevik expropriator's club for robbing banks. He robbed the Tiflis pawn shop, the Georgian Bank of Agriculture, a train at Kars, a stagecoach in Borzhomi, stole 20,000 rubles from the Kadzhorskoe stagecoach and ambushed a gold train at Chiatura carrying 21,000 roubles of miners' wages.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 130 He was at Stalin's wedding supper in 1906. In 1907 he was arrested by the Okhrana, then joined Stalin's 'Mauserists' in Baku.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 168 On August 15, 1912 he helped spring Kamo from Tiflis prison. On September 24 the two of them ambushed a mail coach with 18 gunmen three miles from Tiflis. They were beaten back though seven Cossacks died. After this, the Druzhina was destroyed.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 216 In 1917, Stalin introduced Tsintsadze to Vladimir Lenin \\"Meet Kote Tsintsadze the old bank robber-terrorist of the Caucasus.\\"Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 302 Later, he became the first permanent chairman of the Georgian Cheka, which was established in February 1921, immediately following the Soviet invasion of Georgia. At the same time, he was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee and of the Central Executive Committee of the Georgian SSR. Although ruthless against the widespread anti- Soviet opposition in Georgia, he was a strong proponent of Georgian sovereignty from Moscow and, during the 1922 Georgian Affair, engaged in a bitter political confrontation with Stalin and Sergo Ordzhonikidze whom the Georgian moderate Communists accused of \\"Great Russian chauvinism\\". As a result, Tsintsadze was denounced as a \\"national deviationist\\" and removed from his posts later that year, being replaced by E. A. Kvantaliani, who was more compliant with the centralizers' policy.Knight, Ami W. (1993), Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant, p .29. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, . Having joined the Left Opposition in 1923, Tsintsadze was excluded from the Communist Party in 1927 and arrested in 1928. He died in prison of tuberculosis.

In 1966 he had his first solo exhibition at Gallery A, Melbourne from which a work was purchased for the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1968, he participated in 'The Field' an extremely influential exhibition at the new National Gallery of Victoria, which effectively launched color field abstraction in Australia. He taught at Rochedale College, Toronto before moving to New York City in 1969. He returned to Melbourne in 1978 to be artist-in-residence at the University of Melbourne. The winner of many art awards and prizes, he has exhibited consistently in Australia since 1966 in more than 50 solo exhibitions, including retrospectives. In 2001 the Bendigo Art Gallery established the Robert Jacks Drawing Prize. In 2006, he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).

Biography  Kevin Long grew up in Battle Creek, Michigan and attended the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, where he majored in advertising illustration. Upon graduating, Long worked in the local advertising industry. Having completed a five-year stint in his chosen profession, he was lured away by the artistic and creative freedom offered by Palladium Books. While there, Long built his reputation as one of the most popular illustrators in the role- playing industry. In addition to having created the dynamic look of various characters, vehicles, and equipment in Rifts, he co-authored a number of other Palladium RPG titles. However, Long left Palladium in August 1995 for unspecified reasons. In October 1997, Raven Software hired Long as a 2-D artist.

Playing career Lewis was born in Aberystwyth and started his career with Bristol Rovers in September 1899, before moving to the South coast to join Southern League Portsmouth in May 1900. After one season at Fratton Park, he moved to the Midlands to join Burton United playing in the Second Division of the Football League. After three seasons, he returned to the Southern League with Bristol Rovers in August 1904 where he won a cap for Wales in the match against England on 19 March 1906. Shortly afterwards he moved back to the south coast with Brighton & Hove Albion, where he spent one season before arriving at Southampton, his third south coast club. Although rather small, Lewis was a clever forward but sometimes found his size a handicap against burly opponents. In his one season at The Dell, he formed a useful partnership with Fred Harrison as well as linking up well with fellow forwards, Frank Jefferis and George Smith. He made 24 Southern League appearances for The Saints and his 10 goals made him top scorer for the club in the 1907‚Äì08 league season.

He was born in Emden. Since f√ºr Cello solo (written 1964), he has composed in all genres, including many pieces for unaccompanied solo instruments and theatre works. He has always remained outside of the mainstream and has never been associated with any of the many movements in postwar European music, though he did attend summer courses at Darmstadt in the 1980s. Today, Hespos is still relatively unknown in the United States. Even by the standards of the European avant-garde, Hespos' music usually is quite extreme and unconventional. In his many pieces for solo instruments, Hespos pushes instruments to their timbral limits, employing extended techniques and other effects to create unusual sounds (For example, Duma (1980) for alto flute requires the performer to spit into his or her instrument to create sickly gargling sounds). He frequently writes for less- common instruments, such as cimbalon (1976's Cang) or musical saw (used in Ganifita-Blues, 1984). He even calls for extreme stage techniques in his theatre works‚Äîthe famous piece Seiltanz (\\"Tightrope Dance\\", 1982) requires an actor to break his way out of a metal cage by means of a welding torch. Hespos' scores very frequently employ graphic notation, verbal instructions, traditional music notation or some combination thereof. Many of his works involve improvisation (For example, t a n E K (2013) with improvisational parts by Kommissar Hjuler and Mama Baer). Additionally, Hespos' music must often be performed without a conductor, putting even greater demands on the performers. Hespos has been the recipient of many awards and honors in his career, including the 1967 Gaudeamus International Composers Award and a scholarship to study at the Villa Massimo in Rome in 1972.

Despite numerous tests no proof of these allegations has ever materialized. Thorpe has steadfastly denied the allegations, and he has been a prominent critic of the drug policies used by the World Anti-Doping Agency and FINA, the governing body of world swimming as being too lax, and poorly conducted.  2000 German allegations  In 2000, Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour in order to hone his racecraft prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics, but was faced comments from German head coach Manfred Thiesmann. Thiesmann implied that Thorpe was using steroids, stating \\"We all know Lamberti was pumped up and his times stood for ages, but Thorpe is not only passing them ‚Äì he's passing them by seconds.\\"Talbot (2003) p. 156. The Australian delegation pointed to Thorpe's clean record, while Swimming World editor-in-chief Phillip Whitten stated his belief that Thorpe was clean: \\"There is absolutely no reason to suspect Ian Thorpe is doping. Detailed underwater stroke analysis shows he has extraordinary technique. In addition, he exhibits none of the physical signs of drug use. His physical attributes, natural talent, excellent coaching and superior technique account entirely for his superb performances.\\" At the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, Thorpe and American backstroke World Champion Lenny Krayzelburg were drug tested. Unable to locate the required containers, the testing officials asked the swimmers for permission to have their samples left unsealed in a fridge overnight against the security protocol for drug testing, permission that was refused by the Australian and US officials. After a standoff, a compromise was struck: German police officers were called in to take temporary responsibility for the samples. Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5 s from his world short course record in the 200 m freestyle, receiving a standing ovation from a German crowd that disagreed with Thiesmann's comments. Thorpe rates this as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level. Accusations of drug use continued later in the year, this time from German captain Chris-Carol Bremer, who stated that Thorpe's \\"hands and feet are unusually big\\" due to the use of human growth hormone. Thorpe denied the claims and called for the introduction of blood testing, promising to have a sample frozen to prove his innocence upon the discovery of such a test. Although a test for EPO was developed in time for the games, no positive test for hGh was found.Hunter (2004), pp. 198‚Äì202.  2007 L'Equipe allegations  In March 2007, L'√âquipe, a French daily sports newspaper, reported on its website that Thorpe showed \\"abnormal levels\\" of two banned substances in a doping test in May 2006. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) later confirmed that Thorpe was investigated for abnormal levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH); both naturally occurring in the body. Thorpe's elevated LH level was what caused ASADA to initially investigate, and dismiss, the test result. Thorpe denied the rumours in a press conference on 31 March 2007 stating, \\"I firmly believe I am clean, I have never cheated and have always fulfilled my obligations.\\" In April 2007, the World Anti-Doping Agency (or WADA) issued a statement condemning the breach-of-privacy L'Equipe's announcement constituted.  Anti-drugs campaign  Thorpe is prominent in the campaign against drug use, inside and outside sports. He has called for the introduction of blood testing, and criticised FINA for allegedly inadequate drug-testing procedures, claiming that \\"for anyone to think that they're swimming at a clean Olympic Games, they'd be naive\\". Although swimmers and coaches praised him, he was condemned by FINA, who accused him of bringing the sport into disrepute.Hunter (2004), p. 379. Thorpe was selected by the United Nations to lead an anti-recreational drugs campaign in Japan,Hunter (2004), p. 250. as well as promotional work for UNICEF for UN Children's Week.Hunter (2004), p. 279.

Hal Sparks was the host, with Ed MacKay announcing. It was commonly paired with the kids game show Slime Time, also in syndication. The two shows debuted and were cancelled on the same dates. Treasure Mall was considered to be the first ever children's shopping game show. Gameplay Two teams, each consisting of one boy and one girl, competed. In round 1, teams heard survey questions with three possible answers. (For example: \\"We asked sixth graders what they would do if they saw a bug on their friend's shoulder. Would they brush it off, tell their friend, or wait and see what happens?\\") Each teammate locked in what they believed was the most popular answer. A right answer won a point for their team (if both teammates agreed and were correct, they score two points). The first team to reach 5 points or more won the right to enter a store in the Treasure Mall. If there was a tie on 5 or more, the round continued until one team had the lead outright. Every store in the mall had a theme; Toy Store, Fashion Boutique, etc. The stores were divided into four distinct sections, with 4 coins hidden in each section; each teammate searched two areas, taking alternating turns to do so. One teammate had 25 seconds to search the first section for coins, dropping them into a bucket Sparks was holding. The coins had to go into the bucket for them to count. When time ran out (indicated by a bell), the clock reset to 25 and the other teammate began the next section immediately. After the final buzzer, the coins were counted up. The team won a prize package depending on how well they did; the more coins they collected, the better the package. Two valuable prizes were won if a team managed to find all 16 coins. Round 2 was played exactly the same way, except that the team won the right to enter a different store. The team who had more coins at the end of this round (or the team who won both rounds) won the game and advanced to the bonus round. If both teams have the same amount of coins, another survey question is played. Bonus Round In the bonus round, a series of gift boxes sat center stage in front of a large golden treasure chest. Inside the gift boxes were keys, and the team had 30 seconds to go through the boxes and collect as many keys as they could. The keys had to go into the bucket Sparks was holding in order to count. After time ran out, Sparks tried each key out in the treasure chest. If one of the keys opened the chest, the team won a large prize package upon the chest being open balloons would come out confetti would be shot.

The Bracks state Labor government was returned in a landslide result in 2002, but the new phenomenon of the Victorian Greens Party scoring strong results in the inner city seats of Melbourne saw Wynne go to preferences in the once-safe Labor seat.Defeated now, but Senate in the bag, 1 December 2002, Gay Alcorn, The Melbourne Age Previously Labor candidates in inner city seats would either win in their own right, or be helped over the line against Liberal candidates by (preferentially eliminated) Greens (and other) preferences. Richard was promoted to Cabinet Secretary in the Bracks state Labor government following the 2002 election, which he held until 2006. At the 2006 Victorian state election, he achieved a better result than in 2002, after contesting the seat against the Greens and other opponents in a hard-fought campaign.  Minister for Housing, Minister for Local Government and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  Following the successful re-election of the Bracks Labor Government in Victoria in November 2006, Richard Wynne was appointed by the Premier Steve Bracks to the twin roles of Minister for Housing (following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barry Pullen) and Minister for Local Government. One of Wynne's stated goals as Minister for Housing is to solve the current rent crisis sweeping Australia, as investors turn to booming commodities and share markets for better return over the property market.Super idea to ease rent crisis John Ferguson, Herald Sun, 28 February 2007. In April 2007, Richard Wynne, as Local Government Minister, was central to the development of the groundbreaking Victorian Statewide Relationship Register as part of his ongoing involvement in Gay and Lesbian law reform. After the unexpected resignation of Premier Steve Bracks and the subsequent appointing of new Premier John Brumby, Wynne was given a third portfolio as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, as well as maintaining his previous roles of Minister for Housing and Minister for Local Government in Premier Brumby's new cabinet.  Other interests  The Victorian Parliament handbook lists Richard Wynne's interests as 'family and reading'. He is a keen supporter of Australian rules football, fencing and hockey.  Corkman pub case  main article Carlton Inn - Court case Wynne started a case in 2016 to prosecute rogue developers that had demolished a heritage-listed pub, the Carlton Inn. Initially, the case saw the developers fined in Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. However, in 2019, before the case was to appear in court, he cut a deal with the developers allowing them to build a 12-storey tower on the site instead of rebuilding the pub, as long as they did it by 2022, with possible financial benefits for the developers from the tower construction. There was criticism from parties to the case, and the National Trust.\\"Corkman Cowboys Cut Deal With Minister And City Council on Pub Site\\" Following the deal being cut with the developers, there was criticism from the state opposition and various groups, with comments that Wynne had effectively \\"waved the white flag\\" to developers, possibly encouraging them to knock down heritage-listed properties for further redevelopment. Both heritage groups and the state opposition demanded that the government compulsory acquire the land under section 172 of the Planning and Environment Act.\\"Push for state to forcibly acquire corkman site from cowboy developers\\", Clay Lucas, The Age ‚Äì 1 June 2019 References External links  * Parliamentary voting record of Richard Wynne at Victorian Parliament Tracker *Richard Wynne MP's local member website *Richard Wynne's entry in the Victorian Parliament's RE-Member biographical database website *Richard Wynne's entry on the Victorian Premier & Cabinet website *Richard Wynne's entry on the ALP Victorian Branch website Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Victoria Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly Category:Mayors and Lord Mayors of Melbourne Category:Australian social workers Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:Labor Left politicians ","title":"Richard Wynne"},{"id":"10905952","text":"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is the second game in the StarCraft video game series.

Lanosterol is a key four-ringed intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. In humans, lanosterol synthase is encoded by the LSS gene. In eukaryotes, lanosterol synthase is an integral monotopic protein associated with the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Some evidence suggests that the enzyme is a soluble, non-membrane bound protein in the few prokaryotes that produce it. Due to the enzyme's role in cholesterol biosynthesis, there is interest in lanosterol synthase inhibitors as potential cholesterol-reducing drugs, to complement existing statins. Mechanism Figure 1: Lanosterol synthase mechanism. The discrete carbocation intermediates show the non- concerted nature of the mechanism. Though some data on the mechanism has been obtained by the use of suicide inhibitors, mutagenesis studies, and homology modeling, it is still not fully understood how the enzyme catalyzes the formation of lanosterol. Initial epoxide protonation and ring opening Before the acquisition of the protein's X-ray crystal structure, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine residues key to the enzyme's catalytic activity. It was determined that an aspartic acid residue (D455) and two histidine residues (H146 and H234) were essential to enzyme function. Corey et al. hypothesized that the aspartic acid acts by protonating the substrate's epoxide ring, thus increasing its susceptibility to intramolecular attack by the nearest double bond, with H146 possibly intensifying the proton donor ability of the aspartic acid through hydrogen bonding. After acquisition of the X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme, the role of D455 as a proton donor to the substrate's epoxide was confirmed, though it was found that D455 is more likely stabilized by hydrogen bonding from two cysteine residues (C456 and C533) than from the earlier suggested histidine. Ring formation cascade Epoxide protonation activates the substrate, setting off a cascade of ring forming reactions. Four rings in total (A through D) are formed, producing the cholesterol backbone. Though the idea of a concerted formation of all four rings had been entertained in the past, kinetic studies with (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene analogs showed that product formation is achieved through discrete carbocation intermediates (see Figure 1). Isolation of monocyclic and bicyclic products from lanosterol synthase mutants has further weakened the hypothesis of a concerted mechanism. Evidence suggests that epoxide ring opening and A ring formation is concerted, though. Structure Lanosterol synthase is a two-domain monomeric protein composed of two connected (Œ±/Œ±) barrel domains and three smaller Œ≤-structures. The enzyme active site is in the center of the protein, closed off by a constricted channel. Passage of the (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene substrate through the channel requires a change in protein conformation. In eukaryotes, a hydrophobic surface (6% of the total enzyme surface area) is the ER membrane-binding region (see Figure 2). The enzyme contains five fingerprint regions containing Gln-Trp motifs, which are also present in the highly analogous bacterial enzyme squalene-hopene cyclase. Residues of these fingerprint regions contain stacked sidechains which are thought to contribute to enzyme stability during the highly exergonic cyclization reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. Function=Catalysis of lanosterol formation Lanosterol synthase catalyzes the conversion of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene to lanosterol, a key four- ringed intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. Thus, it in turn provides the precursor to estrogens, androgens, progestogens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and neurosteroids. In eukaryotes the enzyme is bound to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While cholesterol synthesis is mostly associated with eukaryotes, few prokaryotes have been found to express lanosterol synthase; it has been found as a soluble protein in Methylococcus capsulatus. Catalysis of epoxylanosterol formation Lanosterol synthase also catalyzes the cyclization of 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol, which is later converted to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. Since the enzyme affinity for this second substrate is greater than for the monoepoxy (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, under partial inhibition conversion of 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol is favored over lanosterol synthesis. This has relevance for disease prevention and treatment (see Disease Relevance, below). Clinical Significance=Enzyme inhibitors as cholesterol-lowering drugs Interest has grown in lanosterol synthase inhibitors as drugs to lower blood cholesterol and treat atherosclerosis. The widely popular statin drugs currently used to lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol function by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity. Because this enzyme catalyzes the formation of precursors far upstream of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene and cholesterol, statins may negatively influence amounts of intermediates required for other biosynthetic pathways (e.g. synthesis of isoprenoids, coenzyme Q). Thus, lanosterol synthase, which is more closely tied to cholesterol biosynthesis than HMG-CoA reductase, is an attractive drug target. Lanosterol synthase inhibitors are thought to lower LDL and VLDL cholesterol by a dual control mechanism. Studies in which lanosterol synthase is partially inhibited have shown both a direct decrease in lanosterol formation and a decrease in HMG-CoA reductase activity. The oxysterol 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol, which is preferentially formed over lanosterol during partial lanosterol synthase inhibition, is believed to be responsible for this inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Evolution It is believed that oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs, the class to which lanosterol cyclase belongs) evolved from bacterial squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC), which is involved with the formation of hopanoids. Phylogenetic trees constructed from the amino acid sequences of OSCs in diverse organisms suggest a single common ancestor, and that the synthesis pathway evolved only once. The discovery of steranes including cholestane in 2.7-billion year-old shales from Pilbara Craton, Australia, suggests that eukaryotes with OSCs and complex steroid machinery were present early in earth's history.

Family and early career  McIntyre was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin and began working at a young age to support his widowed mother.McIntyre at age 13 is described as an \\"actor in travelling theatre\\" in 1870 US Federal Census, Kenosha Ward 1, Kenosha, Wisconsin, Roll M593_1770, p. 201, document available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com. He showed an early aptitude for dancing and acting. McIntyre sold candy on trains and when \\"the passengers were in danger of being bored Jim would get out in the aisles and entertain them with his clever acting.\\" He learned the dance form known as clogging, which is part of the tap dance style. In his early teens he was keen on joining the circus troupes that passed through Kenosha. His mother initially prevented him from doing so. In 1870, he joined the McKenzie circus and then in 1871 joined the Burton and Ridgeway minstrels and toured the South and Western states for a year. Later he performed with the Katie Putnam Troupe, and toured with the Great Transatlantic circus in 1873.See entry \\"James McIntyre\\" in Olympians of the Sawdust Circle, Circus Historical Society. He married Emma Maude Young (1862‚Äì1935). She was a dancer and balladeer known by the stage names of \\"Maude Clifford\\", and \\"Maud Clifton\\" and she performed as part of the Katie Putnam Troupe. Although they had no natural born children of their own they did adopt a daughter Maud Ainsworth Young (1892‚Äì1966).Maud McIntyre aged 17 is described as \\"adopted daughter\\" in 1910 US Federal Census, Brooklyn Ward 32, Kings County, New York, Roll: T624_985, p9B, Enumeration District 1000, available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com.

Partnership with Heath  James McIntyre and Thomas Heath in a scene from \\"The Ham Tree\\" In 1874, he met Thomas Kurton Heath (1853‚Äì1938) in Texas. They developed a blackface tramp duo minstrel act. McIntyre played the character of Alexander Hambletonian who was a buffoonish stable-boy. Heath acted as \\"Henry Jones\\" a clever black entertainer who frequently outwits Alexander. Their routines included an oft-performed skit known as the Georgia Minstrels where the character Henry persuades the witless Alexander to quit working as a stable-boy and joins a traveling show where he is promised fame and fortune. None of the fame or fortune materializes and Alexander has comical and outrageous tasks to perform under Henry's direction which allowed them to act out comedic dialogue, dance and songs. Another skit, called the Ham Tree, and which formed the nucleus of a later stage play, involved the two characters discussing how ham grows on trees that are three hundred feet tall. Their acting partnership endured for some fifty years as they worked under the twin influential theatre managers of Tony Pastor and Benjamin Franklin Keith appearing as stars in both vaudeville and Broadway. Their blackface minstrel shows were an influential model followed by later film stars such as Al Jolson. Their best known plays included: *The Ham Tree that was performed ninety times at the New York Theatre between August and November 1905. Included in the cast were Belle Gold and W. C. Fields, in his Broadway debut. *In Hayti was performed fifty-six times at the Circle Theatre between August and October 1909. *Hello, Alexander was performed fifty-six times at the 44th Street Theatre between October and November 1919. *Red Pepper was performed at the Shubert Theatre in 1922.

The 85th was formed in 1941 as the 85th Rifle Division from the 2nd Guards People's Militia Division of the Leningrad People's Militia.  World War II = 1st formation  The division was originally formed in 1931 in the Ural MD, seemingly at Chelyabinsk. It seems to have been sent to Belorussian Special Military District, soon to be the Western Special Military District, 1940. Assigned to 4th Rifle Corps, 3rd Army, Soviet Western Front on outbreak of war, under the command of Major General Aleksandr Bondovsky.http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/41_oob/western/army_03.html  85th Rifle Division 2nd formation  After the division's first formation was disbanded or destroyed, the division was reformed. In late 1941 it was reformed during the Leningrad Strategic Defensive from the 2nd Guard People's Militia Division.http://armchairgeneral.com/rkkaww2/formation/DNO.htm In early 1945 the division was operating as part of 122nd Rifle Corps in the 2nd Baltic Front. On 10 March the division marched into the area of Balo≈æi and Kreyli. It attacked between the 43rd and 46th Rifle Divisions on 22 March, capturing Slugi and Meiri, where it ran into strong German counterattacks and went on the defensive until 30 April, when it was relieved by the 43rd and 56th Rifle Divisions. The division transferred to a new defensive line between Mengravil and Yatsy, relieving elements of the 11th Rifle Division. By the end of the day on 7 May, the German troops began to retreat to the northwest. Units of the division pursued the retreating troops towards Lubenki, Rumbiniska, and Tseri and by 17:00 on 8 May reached the line of Myzi Gayta, Yurdi, and Kausi, where at 18:00 they accepted the German surrender.  Cold War  After fighting on the Eastern Front, the division's second formation was relocated to Siberia in 1945. In September 1945, the division, part of the 122nd Rifle Corps, arrived in the city of Novosibirsk in the Siberian Military District, and was given barracks in a military town on Bogatkova street. In 1946, the division was reorganized as the 24th Rifle Brigade. In 1953, the brigade was upgraded and redesignated as the 85th Pavlovsky Rifle Red Banner Division once again. From 1957 the division became the 85th Motorised Rifle Division. Furthermore, the division exchanged regiments with the 74th Motor Rifle Division ‚Äì the 103rd Motor Rifle Regiment was disbanded and replaced by the 228th Sevastopol Order of Alexander Nevsky Motor Rifle Regiment. On 27 March 1967, the division was given the honorary name of Leningrad and it became known as the 85th Motor Rifle Leningrad-Pavlovskaya Red Banner Division. Around 1988 the division consisted of the 387th Tank Regiment, 141st, 59th, 228th MRRs, 167th Artillery Regiment, and the 1131st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment. In 1989 the 1131st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment was disbanded, and was replaced by the 927th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment from the Belorussian Military District.  Service in the Russian Ground Forces  In 1992, the 74th Guards Tank Valga Order of Lenin Red Banner, Orders of Suvorov, Kutuzov and Bogdan Khmelnitsky Regiment relocated from Schwerin in Germany and joined the division. The 74th had previously been assigned to the 94th Motor Rifle Division, which, reduced in status to the 74th Motor Rifle Brigade, had been relocated nearby to Yurga. From December 1994 to 27 April 1995 the division sent personnel to the First Chechen War: 82 officers, 43 corporals, and 373 soldiers and sergeants. The division's troops, part of the Northern Group of Russian Forces, operated with the 74th Brigade. The division's troops cleared Chechen fighters from the administrative and residential buildings in Grozny, defended a strategically important bridge over the Sunzha on the outskirts of the village of Peter, and defended the approaches to the village of Ilinskoe from an invasion of Chechen rebels from Gudermes. In 2003 Major General Vladimir Ashitok was named as the divisional commander.Krasnaya Zvezda 2003-0423, via Scott and Scott, Russian Military Directory 2004 Previous commanders included Major Generals Vasily Lunev, Anatoly Makushin, and Igor Puzanov (between 1983 and 1986). From September 2000, the division fought in the Second Chechen War. The 228th Motor Rifle Regiment, the only Russian regiment to be fully equipped with the BMP-3, was reequipped with MT-LB armoured personnel carriers in 2000 because a six-month tour in Chechniya had reduced the service life of the vehicles by half.AVN Military News Agency report, 31 July 2000, in Orr June 2000, p.98, 101 In other words, maintenance problems were much greater when the vehicles were conscript-crewed.

The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are a conserved group of proteins that serve as key players in the metabolism of organic substances and the biosynthesis of important steroids, lipids, and vitamins in eukaryotes. As a member of this family, lanosterol 14Œ±-demethylase is responsible for an essential step in the biosynthesis of sterols. In particular, this protein catalyzes the removal of the C-14Œ±-methyl group from lanosterol. This demethylation step is regarded as the initial checkpoint in the transformation of lanosterol to other sterols that are widely used within the cell. Evolution The structural and functional properties of the cytochrome P450 superfamily have been subject to extensive diversification over the course of evolution. Recent estimates indicate that there are currently 10 classes and 267 families of CYP proteins. It is believed that 14Œ±-demethylase or CYP51 diverged early in the cytochrome's evolutionary history and has preserved its function ever since; namely, the removal of the 14Œ±-methyl group from sterol substrates. Although CYP51's mode of action has been well conserved, the protein's sequence varies considerably between biological kingdoms. CYP51 sequence comparisons between kingdoms reveal only a 22-30% similarity in amino acid composition.  Structure  Structure of lanosterol 14Œ±-demethylase (CYP51), as identified by Podust et al. Although the structure of 14Œ±-demethylase may vary substantially from one organism to the next, sequence alignment analysis reveals that there are six regions in the protein that are highly conserved in eukaryotes. These include residues in the B' helix, B'/C loop, C helix, I helix, K/Œ≤1-4 loop, and Œ≤-strand 1-4 that are responsible for forming the surface of the substrate binding cavity. Homology modeling reveals that substrates migrate from the surface of the protein to the enzyme's buried active site through a channel that is formed in part by the A' alpha helix and the Œ≤4 loop. Finally, the active site contains a heme prosthetic group in which the iron is tethered to a thiolate ligand on a conserved cysteine residue. This group also binds diatomic oxygen at the sixth coordination site, which is eventually incorporated onto the substrate.  Mechanism  Three-step demethylation of lanosterol, mediated by lanosterol 14Œ±-demethylase. The enzyme-catalyzed demethylation of lanosterol is believed to occur in three steps, each of which requires one molecule of diatomic oxygen and one molecule of NADPH (or some other reducing equivalent). During the first two steps, the 14Œ±-methyl group undergoes typical cytochrome monooxygenation in which one oxygen atom is incorporated by the substrate and the other is reduced to water, resulting in the sterol's conversion to a carboxyalcohol and then a carboxyaldehyde. The aldehyde then departs as formic acid and a double bond is simultaneously introduced to yield the demethylated product.

In the 2005 film version of the first book, and the 2008 sequel, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, she is portrayed by Alexis Bledel. Personality Lena is a shy, introspective aspiring artist of Greek heritage. Lena is very beautiful, but feels uncomfortable when her looks draw attention. Lena considers her biggest weaknesses are her inability to love and trust freely and her tendency to avoid emotionally difficult situations. She feels especially guilty that people like her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Kostas, and one of her best friends, Bridget, who have lost so much in their lives, can live and love freely when she is reluctant to trust others. Another one of her best friends, Tibby, adds that \\"If you asked Lena to pick A or B, she'd always choose C,\\" meaning that Lena has difficulty following her emotions. Rather, she justifies and overthinks everything. She has long dark hair and light green eyes. Family Sister: Lena has an outgoing and somewhat promiscuous younger sister named Effie. She and Effie generally get along, even though they are very different. She does, however, have some disagreements with her sister, as Effie sometimes feels like Lena chooses her friends (the Sisterhood) over her own family. Effie is loud and lighthearted. She is not as beautiful as Lena (having a \\"large Greek nose\\") but is the more charismatic of the two sisters. Effie is still quite attractive though. Effie likes vintage clothes and adores boys. Mother: Lena's mother, Ari, is a psychologist of Greek descent. She is very similar to her daughter in that she tends to be closed off and serious. Ari had a very passionate love affair when she was a young woman, but her lover left for Greece, telling her he'd return and never did, leaving her heartbroken. Lena and her mother sometimes have difficulty connecting, but they find emotional support in one another during Lena's break-up, as her mother can relate. Ari is described as very ambitious. Father: Lena's father, George, is equally ambitious. His father wanted him to continue the family restaurant business in Greece, but he left for America to pursue a career as a lawyer. He is very old-fashioned and is not at all keen about Lena joining art school because he knows she will be painting nude models. Lena observes that though he puts on a tough \\"man of the house\\" exterior, he is actually quite vulnerable and is just worried about losing his daughters. Grandfather: Lena's grandfather \\"Bapi\\" is very close to her, despite the fact that he doesn't speak English, and she speaks only limited Greek. Lena sometimes feels like an outsider amongst her wild and extroverted Greek relatives, but she and Bapi are both more quiet and pensive; he calls her \\"his girl\\" because of this. He is her paternal grandfather. In The Second Summer of the Sisterhood, he dies of a stroke. Grandmother: Lena's paternal grandmother Valia is closer in personality to Effie than Lena. Valia is a vivacious and outgoing Greek woman who loves cooking and has an appetite for gossip. She is the one who initially tried to set Lena up with Kostos. After the death of her husband and subsequent move to America, Valia became bitter and disagreeable, quite in contrast to her previous vibrant personality. Though she is still heartbroken, she becomes more of her old self upon her return to Greece. She hides herself from the world so much that sometimes she pities herself. Friends Her best friends are Tibby Rollins, Carmen Lowell and Bridget Vreeland. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants In the first book in the series, she meets Kostos when she goes to Santorini, Greece, to visit her grandparents. When they first meet, it's obvious that he's immediately infatuated with her, which leads her to dislike him, believing he only likes her because of her beauty. Later, he is apparently spying on her when she goes skinny-dipping in an olive grove, leading their grandfathers to engage in a fight. Later, she realizes that it was all a misunderstanding. She also realizes her true feelings for Kostos. Brashares based Lena on the myth of Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt who, when spotted bathing by a suitor, turned the young man into a stag. book The Second Summer of the Sisterhood We learn that several months after she got together with Kostos, Lena broke up with him because she didn't like her happiness being so dependent on another person. The book centers on her admitting her feelings for Kostos. He eventually visits her and the two spend a happy week together; Kostos then leaves with nothing but cryptic warnings about his obligations in Greece. Later, Bapi dies. At his funeral in Greece, Lena confronts Kostos and he tells her that one of the girls he dated is pregnant; he has married her so that she will not have to raise the child alone and so he can be the \\"gentleman\\". At the end of the book, Lena goes out to dinner with Carmen where she meets Carmen's stepbrother, Paul. The sparks between them are spectacular, and the book ends with Carmen hoping that Lena won't let her relationship difficulties with Kostos get in the way of her going after a great guy like Paul. Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood Lena tries to get over Kostos. She goes to an art class and befriends her teacher Annik, but when her father learns that they are painting nude models, he withdraws his funding for both the class and her tuition to the Rhode Island School of Design. Annik urges her to take a stand for her rights and raise the money herself. Annik is in a wheelchair and asks Lena to paint a portrait of her. Lena, feeling awkward, neglects to paint Annik's wheelchair. Annik tells her that in order to be a real artist she must \\"draw the chair,\\" a metaphor which Lena later uses in her life to encourage her to confront pain instead of shying from it. Using her \\"draw the chair\\" philosophy, Lena finds some closure with her father, sister and bitter grandmother, who is staying with the family in the States due to the death of Bapi the previous summer. It also encourages her to acknowledge the effect her break-up with Kostos had on her and encourages her to finally consider a relationship with Paul. Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood Lena stays at her college, RISD, for a summer art class where she meets a handsome and talented African American young man named Leo. A mutual attraction develops, and eventually she loses her virginity to him. After they have sex, however, Lena is flooded with emotion, realizing that she didn't care for Leo as much as she still cares for Kostos, and feeling disgusted with herself. Meanwhile, Kostos visits her and reveals that he is getting a divorce; his wife claims to have had a miscarriage, but he is suspicious that she made up her pregnancy in the first place to get him to propose to her. Annoyed that things were finally going her way romantically before Kostos came and mixed up her feelings, Lena visits him in his motel and yells at him for expecting her to not have gotten over him. When she visits Greece with the rest of the sisterhood, she meets up with Kostos again. Kostos explains he had bought a ring and was planning to propose to her but failed to ask after Lena yelled at him at the motel. They talk over their relationship and he finally kisses her, before cryptically telling her \\"someday\\" in Greek and leaving for London for school. Sisterhood Everlasting Ten years into the future and Lena is an art teacher at the Rhode Island School of Design, casually dating a sandwich maker named Drew, and still obsessing over Kostos. She decides when she turned 40 that she wanted to spend it in Greece. While drawing a little girl playing on the sidewalk she catches a glance on a man in the corner of her eye, Kostos. She wanted to run but every muscle in her body was panicked. He came up to her and gave her a hug. She was back where she belonged. They start writing to each other again. At the end, Lena and Kostos get back together. Other references Lena is seen by Jo in the novel 3 Willows in which Lena's sister Effie works at a restaurant with Jo. It is mentioned that Lena has recently returned from Europe.
