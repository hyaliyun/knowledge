The \\"Three Conditions of Woman\\": the virgins who dedicated themselves to Christ are shown as harvesting \\"hundredfold\\", the pious widows harvest \\"sixty-fold\\", and the pious married wives harvest \\"thirty-fold\\". The Speculum Virginum (Jungfrauenspiegel \\"Mirror of Virgins\\") is a 12th-century didactic treatise on female monastic life. The original text dates to the mid-12th century and was possibly composed at the Augustinian Abbey of Andernach, founded by Richard, abbot of Springiersbach, for his sister in 1128. Richard appointed one Conrad as spiritual advisor to his sister, and some scholars have suggested Conrad as the text's author. The work provides one of the earliest comprehensive theologies of cloistered religious life. It mainly consists of a hypothetical dialogue between Peregrinus, a male religious teacher, and Theodora, a female disciple. The dialogue seeks to strengthen the determination and resolve of Theodora (and hence by example, other readers) to live life as a virgin dedicated to God. The growth of the various manuscripts of the Speculum Virginum in the Middle Ages had a particular resonance for women who sought a dedicated religious life. While impacting the development of female monastic life, it also influenced the proliferation of male monastic orders,see Mews 2001, pages vii and 1 and even Protestant theology via the writings of Nikolaus SelneckerJungfrauenspiegel und von Notwendigkeit wahrhafter Kirchenzucht (1580) and Conrad Porta.Jungfrawen-Spiegel (Eisleben, 1580) The text was widely read from the 12th century until the Reformation, and it survives in 26 vernacular (Middle Low German) and in 30 Latin recensions. The Latin text was edited with a German translation by Seyfarth (1990). Most surviving manuscripts date to the 15th century. An early version of the Latin text is preserved in Cologne W276a (ca. 1140), possibly originating from Andernach, and in BL Arundel 44.Seyfarth in Mews 2001 (48).

Modern Israel and peace The modern Jewish state of Israel with its majority of Jewish citizens, since its inception and has been involved in a peace process with its Arab neighbors, such as: *The Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty *The Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty *The Peace process in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Messianic Age Judaism is the source-religion for the notion of a Messianic Age, a theological term referring to a future time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without crime, war and poverty. Many religions have come to believe and await such an age; some refer to it as the \\"Kingdom of God\\". According to Jewish tradition, the Messianic Era will be one of global peace and harmony, an era free of strife and hardship, and one conducive to the furtherance of the knowledge of the Creator. The theme of the Jewish Messiah ushering in an era of global peace is encapsulated in two of the most famous scriptural passages from the Book of Isaiah from the verses: and : Rejection of violence Judaism's religious texts overwhelmingly endorse compassion and peace, and the Hebrew Bible contains the well-known commandment to \\"love thy neighbor as thyself\\".*Reuven Firestone (2004), \\"Judaism on Violence and Reconciliation: An examination of key sources\\" in Beyond violence: religious sources of social transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Fordham Univ Press, 2004, pp 77, 81. * * In fact, the love of peace and the pursuit of peace is one of the key principles in Jewish law. While Jewish tradition permits waging war and killing in certain cases, however, the requirement is that one always seek a just peace before waging war.Fighting the War and the Peace: Battlefield Ethics, Peace Talks, Treaties, and Pacifism in the Jewish Tradition. Michael J. Broyde, 1998, p. 1 According to the 1947 Columbus Platform of Reform Judaism, \\"Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has proclaimed to mankind the ideal of universal peace, striving for spiritual and physical disarmament of all nations. Judaism rejects violence and relies upon moral education, love and sympathy.\\"The Columbus Platform: The Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism, 1937 Judaism opposes violence The philosophy of nonviolence has roots in Judaism, going back to the Jerusalem Talmud of the middle third century. While absolute nonviolence is not a requirement of Judaism, the religion so sharply restricts the use of violence, that nonviolence often becomes the only way to fulfilling a life of truth, justice and peace, which Judaism considers to be the three tools for the preservation of the world.Bearing witness: violence and collective responsibility, Sandra L. Bloom, Michael Reichert, Routledge, 1998: page 242 Jewish law (past and present) does not permit any use of violence unless it is in self-defense. Any person that even raises his hand in order to hit another person is called \\"evil.\\" Guidelines from the Torah to the 'Jewish Way to Fight a War' When the time for war arrived, Jewish soldiers are expected to abide by specific laws and values when fighting. Jewish war ethics attempts to balance the value of maintaining human life with the necessity of fighting a war. Judaism is somewhat unusual in that it demands adherence to Jewish values even while fighting a war. The Torah provides the following rules for how to fight a war: #Pursue Peace Before Waging War. #Preserve the Ecological Needs of the Environment. #Maintain Sensitivity to Human Life. #The Goal is Peace. Avoidance of violence The ancient orders (like those) of wars for Israel to eradicate idol worshiping does not apply today. Jews are not taught to glorify violence. The rabbis of the Talmud saw war as an avoidable evil. They taught: \\"The sword comes to the world because of delay of justice and through perversion of justice.\\" Jews have always hated war and \\"Shalom\\" expresses the hope for peace, in Judaism war is evil, but at times a necessary one, yet, Judaism teaches that one has to go to great length to avoid it.Judaism by Arye Forta, Heinemann, 1995, , p. 122 In the Torah When Moses saw a Jew striking another in Egypt (): \\"...he said to the rasha (\\"evil one\\"), why do you hit your fellow!?\\".Exodus 2:13 The midrash comments, \\"Rabbi Yitzhak said: from this you learn that whoever hits his fellow, is called a rasha.\\"Ginzey Schechter, Vol. I, p. 114, as cited by Rabbi Professor David Golinkin, \\"The Jewish Attitude Towards Non- Violent Protest and Civil Disobedience\\" Maimonides ruled that whoever strikes his fellow transgresses a negative commandment.Maimonides, Hovel Umazik 5:1, as cited by Rabbi Professor David Golinkin, \\"The Jewish Attitude Towards Non- Violent Protest and Civil Disobedience\\" According to Deuteronomy, an offer of peace is to be made to any city which is besieged, conditional on the acceptance of terms of tribute.Judaism and the ethics of war, Norman Solomon. International Review of the Red Cross. Volume 87 Number 858 June 2005 In the Mishna In the Mishna, Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel taught: \\"The world rests on three things: justice, truth, and peace.\\"Pirkei Avot 1:18 The Mishna sages further asked, who is a hero of heroes? They answered, not one who defeats his enemy but one who turns an enemy into a friend.Avot de Rabbi Natan 23 In the Talmud Shalom (\\"peace\\"), is one of the underlying principles of the Torah, \\"Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom ('peace').\\"Proverbs 3:17 \\" The Talmud explains, \\"The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom\\".Talmud, Gittin 59b Maimonides comments in his Mishneh Torah: \\"Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.'\\" Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Chanukah 4:14 According to Talmudic teaching, the very fact of taking someone's life, even when justly doing so, it effects, nevertheless the person, as the Talmud regards even a justly court that did order (in ancient times) the death penalty justifiably, that particular court at that time was labeled \\"killer court\\" in shame.El Talmud by Iser Guinzburg, Editorial MAXTOR, 2009, , , p. 54 and even King David, regarded by Jewish tradition as the most pious righteous person, (and his wars were within God's permission or/and orders) was denied building the Jewish Temple, the Talmud explains that when King David asked \\"Why can I not build the Bais Hamikdash?\\" God's answer was: \\"Your hands have spilled blood (in all your many wars).\\" The Talmud also teaches: \\"Be of the persecuted rather than the persecutor\\".Bava Kama 93a Later scholars Medieval Jewish commentators including the Spanish theologian and commentator Isaac Arama (c. 1420‚Äì1494), and Isaac Abravanel (1437‚Äì1508), emphasized the commitment of Judaism to peace. According to sixteenth century Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague, Jewish law forbids the killing of innocent people, even in the course of a legitimate military engagement. The Italian rabbi Samuel David Luzzatto (1800‚Äì1865) stated categorically that the only permissible war was defensive. Later, a similar position prohibiting offensive war was taken by Rabbi Yeshayahu Karelitz (the Hazon Ish, 1878‚Äì1953). Modern scholars Rabbi Moshe Avigdor Amiel (1883‚Äì1946), who was the Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, wrote that military restraint was an absolute demand of Torah law, for \\"Thou shalt not murder\\" applied irrespective of whether the victim was Arab or Jew, and was the basis of Jewish ethics. Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who had served in the Israel Defense Forces as both paratrooper and chief chaplain, was instrumental in the formulation of the IDF official doctrine of ethics, and the concept of Purity of arms. He wrote: > \\"Human life is undoubtedly a supreme value in Judaism, as expressed both in > the Halacha and the prophetic ethic. This refers not only to Jews, but to > all men created in the image of God.\\" Violent tactics forbidden by Halakhah Jewish law prohibits the use of outright vandalism in warfare. It forbids destruction of fruit trees as a tactic of war. It is also forbidden to break vessels, tear clothing, wreck that which is built up, stop fountains, or waste food in a destructive manner. Killing an animal needlessly or offering poisoned water to livestock are also forbidden. Those few cases in the Bible in which this norm was violated are special cases. One example was when King Hezekiah stopped all the fountains in Jerusalem in the war against Sennacherib, which Jewish scholars regards as a violation of the Biblical commandment. According to Maimonides, on besieging a city in order to seize it, it must not be surrounded on all four sides but only on three sides, thus leaving a path of escape for whomever wishes to flee to save his life. Nachmanides, writing a century later, strengthened the rule and added a reason: \\"We are to learn to deal kindly with our enemy.\\" Notable rabbis Despite controversial public comments, Ovadia Yosef, an influential Sephardic rabbi and distinguished rabbinical authority, advocates for peace negotiations in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict since the late 1980s. His main justification is the halakhic principle of Pikuach Nefesh, in which all the Jewish commandments (excluding adultery, idolatry, and murder) are put on hold if a life is put in danger. Using an argument first articulated by the late American rabbinical leader Joseph Soloveitchik, Rabbi Yosef claims that the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict endangers human lives, thereby meeting the above criteria and overruling the priority of commandments pertaining to settling the land of Israel. Therefore, Israel is permitted‚Äîeven obligated if saving lives is a definitive outcome‚Äîto make serious efforts to reach a peace settlement as well as to make arrangements to properly protect its citizens.Rav Ovadia Yossef. \\"Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives\\", Tehumim Vol. 10, 1989Rav Ovadia Yossef. \\"Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives\\", Crossroads: Halacha and the Modern World Vol. 3, 1990 Rabbi Yosef first applied the Pikuach Nefesh principle to Israel's conflicts with its neighbors in 1979, when he ruled that this argument granted Israel authority to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.

Motivation and history It was first presented at the New Theatre in New York City under the management of Winthrop Ames, in February 1911, certain concessions had to be made, so the author confessed, ‚Äúto what was thought to be the demand for a drama of Indian life which should present the Indian more nearly as he is popularly conceived.‚Äù But, even in the presentation, care was taken that the music be reminiscent of Indian themes, that the chants be played from phonograph records of Indian ceremonials, that the dances be taught by one Chief Red Eagle, and that the costumes and properties have the authenticity of the American Museum of Natural History. When the play was revised and issued definitively in 1915 (Boston), its notes and glossary revealed Austin's desire to make of The Arrow Maker an archaeologically correct representation of the Native American as known to her. From 1921 through 1930 The Arrow Maker was staged outdoors as one of three \\"Desert Plays\\" in Tahquitz Canyon near Palm Springs, California. Plot The central character in the drama, The Chisera, is a Medicine Woman of the Paiutes ‚Äî who, in communion with the gods, is supposed to be as one removed from human passion. Those who come to her regard her as an intermediary, with the power of influencing the Great One. They all work her ‚Äúto their best advantage.‚Äù But The Chisera tires of her lonely occupation and gives her love to Simwa, the Arrow Maker. In the tribal matters that follow this complication the drama is a tragic revelation of Indian plotting and deceit. The Chisera is deserted by Simwa for the chief's daughter, and though this Medicine Woman has not been taught the potent exercise of hate, she ceases to exercise her power of intercession with the gods. And this brings misfortune to the tribe and grief to those involved in the way of Simwa and of one Padahoon, both rivals for tribal leadership. The final curtain falls on the death of The Chisera, mortally wounded by one of her own enchanted arrows. Genre Apart from its archaeological faithfulness, The Arrow Maker is a dignified attempt to write an American Indian drama. It is the latest in a long line of Indian dramas the first of which, Robert Roger's Ponteach, was written in 1767.

It lies in Preslav, the former capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, today a town in northeastern Bulgaria. The church dates to the early 10th century, the time of Tsar Simeon I's rule, and was unearthed and first archaeologically examined in 1927‚Äì1928. Considered to be one of the most impressive examples of medieval Bulgarian architecture, the Round Church takes its name from the distinctive shape of one of its three sections, the cella (naos), which is a rotunda that serves as a place of liturgy. The church's design also includes a wide atrium and a rectangular entrance area, or narthex, marked by two circular turrets. The church has been likened to examples of religious architecture from the late Roman (Early Christian) period, the Caucasus, and the Carolingian Pre-Romanesque of Charlemagne because of its characteristic plan, which is significantly different from contemporaneous Bulgarian or Byzantine buildings. The church's alternative name, the Golden Church, stems from its possible and popular identification with a \\"new golden church\\" in Preslav referenced in a medieval literary source. The Round Church's rich interior decoration, which makes ample use of mosaics, ceramics and marble details, distinguishes it from other churches in Preslav. Its interior features hundreds of drawings depicting ships, fauna, and Christian figures. Medieval inscriptions on the walls range from names of saints in Byzantine Greek to separate letters and short texts in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets. Background Founded in 681 as a pagan state, Bulgaria was formally Christianised by Byzantine clergy in the 860s, under Prince Boris (r. 852‚Äì889). The right to convert Bulgaria to Christianity was the subject of a political dispute between Byzantium and the Papacy. With the conversion to Christianity, Boris hoped to solve internal ethnic issues and improve the foreign relations of his state, which was not treated equally by the Christian rulers of Europe.Crampton, pp. 9‚Äì11 The Round Church was constructed during the rule of Boris' son and successor, Simeon (r. 893‚Äì927), whose successful campaigns established Bulgaria's temporary superiority over Byzantium,Stephenson, p. 18 at times threatening the Byzantine capital at Constantinople. He extended the territory of the First Bulgarian Empire over most of the Balkans,Stavreva, p. 19 to the Adriatic and the Aegean. Simeon also conquered the lands of modern Serbia and Montenegro and efficiently eliminated the Magyar threat from the north. Counted among Bulgaria's greatest leaders, Simeon was a benefactor of literature and the arts; his reign is considered the \\"Golden Age\\" of medieval Bulgarian cultureCrampton, pp. 16‚Äì17 because of Bulgaria's literary influence over contemporary Slavic Europe. The city of Preslav was made the capital of Bulgaria early in Simeon's reign, partly because of the former capital Pliska's association with pre-Christian paganism. Simeon turned Preslav into a cultural centre, a true rival to Constantinople.Stephenson, pp. 18‚Äì19 Some of the most eminent scholars of Bulgaria's Golden Age worked at the Preslav Literary School. Intended more as a royal residence and a showcase of cultural power than a fortress, the city boasted impressive architecture, including a large number of characteristic palaces and dozens of churches. Among them the Round Church, regarded as \\"one of the most impressive monuments of medieval Bulgarian architecture\\"Delev and an \\"expression of the highest achievements of Old Bulgarian culture\\",Totev, p. 58 stood out. Identification and history The Round Church is popularly identified with the \\"new golden church\\" referenced in a colophon to an Old Bulgarian translation of Athanasius of Alexandria's Orations Against the Arians. The text says that the translation was done on the order of Prince Simeon by Constantine of Preslav and copied by Theodore Dox, \\"at the mouth of the Ticha in the [Byzantine] year 6415 indiction 14 [907 AD], where the same prince had the holy new golden church built\\".Curta, p. 220 It is uncertain whether the \\"mouth of the Ticha\\" refers to a narrow section of the river, to the Ustie pass near the city, or possibly to a certain location next to the outer city walls and in the direct vicinity of the Round Church ruins. This problem aside, if \\"golden\\" is to be taken literally, the source is also unclear as to whether the church is the new one among the city's golden churches, or the single golden one among the new churches in Preslav.Nikolova, pp. 88‚Äì89 Scholar Stancho Vaklinov considers the identification of the Round Church as the \\"new golden church\\" from literature \\"incontestable\\",Vaklinov, p. 196 while art historian Nikola Mavrodinov is of the opinion that it is probable.Mavrodinov, p. 150 On the other hand, historian A. P. Vlasto believes this identification to be \\"not absolutely certain\\".Vlasto, p. 171 If the church from the marginal note is equated with the Round Church, then it can be conclusively dated to no more than a few years before 907.Balgarska entsiklopedia A‚ÄìYa While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church.Nikolova, pp. 91‚Äì92Nachev, p. 17 The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.Nachev, p. 18 There is debate in Bulgarian academic circles as to whether the church was built as a monastery church or as a separate cathedral. If the buildings neighbouring the church are interpreted as the residential part of a monastery, it was most probably established after the construction of the Round Church, during the rule of Tsar Peter I (r. 927‚Äì969). The absence of entrances on these buildings on the sides facing the church and the presence of a large atrium make it unlikely. Another argument against the Round Church being a monastery church is its location, isolated from other buildings yet accessible to the public outside the inner city.Nikolova, p. 89 Scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it a city cathedral and compares it in function to the Great Basilica in Pliska.Nikolova, p. 54 Another researcher, Krastyu Miyatev, sees it as a royal church of Simeon,Miyatev, p. 98 but art historian Nikola Mavrodinov and archaeologist Totyu Totev insist it belonged to a monastery from the beginning.Mavrodinov, p. 151Totev, p. 63 The earliest excavations of the site were carried out in 1927‚Äì1928 by archaeologists from the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia and the Bulgarian Antiquities Society under the direction of Yordan Gospodinov. A second effort headed by Krastyu Miyatev resulted in a much more in-depth study, and archaeological research at the site is ongoing.Nikolova, p. 88 In 1927, the Round Church, along with the entirety of medieval Preslav, was proclaimed a historical and archaeological reserve and placed under state protection as a national antiquity. In 1970, it was individually included in the list of monuments of culture of national importance with a publication in that year's State Gazette, issue 46. As part of the Veliki Preslav architectural reserve, the Round Church is listed as No. 98 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. The Church of St Petka in Ruse, opened in 1944, was built as a reconstruction of the Round Church in Preslav. The Round Church underwent partial restoration in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In December 2009, plans were announced to reconstruct the church in its entirety, without demolishing or altering any of the original structural remains. A monument dedicated to Tsar Simeon was unveiled in the immediate vicinity of the Round Church on 27 May 2007 to honour the 1080th anniversary of his death. Despite not being an active church, it is regularly used for baptisms and weddings. Architecture=Location and style The Round Church was built outside Preslav's inner city, which mostly included the royal palace and its associated buildings such as the Royal Basilica.Nikolova, p. 93 It was still within the outer city limits, and lay in Preslav's southeastern part, some from the South Gate of the inner city. It was situated on a high terrace.Koeva Today the Round Church, along with the other ruins of medieval Preslav, lie not far from the modern town of Veliki Preslav, which is the administrative centre of a municipality in Shumen Province, northeastern Bulgaria. Simplified floor plan While no church from this age in the Slavic-populated parts of the Balkans was up-to-date with contemporary Byzantine architecture, the Round Church differs markedly because of its centralized, circular plan, which is unique in medieval Bulgarian architecture.Curta, p. 221 The rounded and dynamic nature of its shapes is in contrast with the sharp rectangular designs of that period. It is most likely based on the abundant examples of late Roman or early Byzantine buildings that lay ruined in the Bulgarian lands. The layout, particularly the rotunda, resembles churches from the time of Justinian I such as the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, the Little Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (today Istanbul), and the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki. Even if the plan is unusual, the technology and principles employed in its construction are contemporary to the 10th century and in accord with other monuments in Preslav.Vaklinov, pp. 199‚Äì200Miyatev, p. 69 Byzantine churches are not the only source of inspiration that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence,Kazhdan, p. 335Vaklinov, p. 200 perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics.Totev, p. 61 At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork. Description The Round Church includes three sections: the wide atrium (or courtyard), the narthex and the cella (also naos or, due to its shape, rotunda), each serving as a premise to the other. The sections were not necessarily built at the same time, and it is generally accepted that a reconstruction of the church was carried out some time after its completion.Nikolova, p. 92 Mavrodinov and archaeologist Karel ≈†korpil believe the narthex and cella comprised the first building period, while the atrium was added very shortly after that and by the same architect. The church has a total length of , including the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured.Nikolova, p. 91 The floor was covered by marble and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks were used for the atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls. =Atrium= The outermost part of the Round Church is its atrium, the flanked open space leading into the narthex. It is accessed by means of three gates (one on each wall), of which the entrance on the main west wall is the most elaborate and grandest in appearance. The atrium is almost square in shape and measures . A water well was constructed in the center of the courtyard; it was linked to a water conduit.Mavrodinov, p. 152 The sides of the atrium are decorated by a multitude of vaults with piers in between. In total, there are fourteen vaults: four on each of the courtyard's three walls and one each where the west wall meets the sides. The atrium includes an equal number of round limestone columns each standing opposite one of the piers, apart. =Narthex= View from the centre of the rotunda west towards the atrium The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets.Totev, p. 60 Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth. Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Nikolova, pp. 89‚Äì90 Measuring , the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach . Its two turrets have a diameter of ; each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.Nikolova, p 90 =Rotunda= The round cella is the easternmost and most important part of the church, as it was where the liturgy was performed. The diameter of the rotunda is . It is accessed through three gates, all from the narthex. It was entirely covered by a dome. Twelve vaults, semicircular as seen from the inside and pentagonal on the outer wall, were constructed north and south of the rotunda's eastern part, the apse, which itself fits into one of the vaults. Large buttresses reinforce the structure both inside and outside. A circle of ten or twelve white marble columns was inscribed inside the rotunda, from the interior buttresses. The capitals of the columns are similar to those of the royal palace in Preslav. A copper- plated wooden coffin lay in a burial chamber by one of the vaults near the apse. The semicircular apse fits naturally with the other vaults of the rotunda despite being larger, and features vaults on its north and south walls. The marble ambon was situated in the center of the circle of columns and of the whole rotunda, directly under the dome's centre,Mavrodinov, p. 164 as evidenced by a mortar padding. Stairs from the east and west, aligned with the apse, used to lead up to the ambon. The bishop's throne or cathedra probably lay near one of the south vaults, which was likely enlarged for the purpose. Decoration Cornice from the Round Church with floral motifs The interior was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and ceramics.Vaklinov, pp. 198‚Äì199 With the exception of the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople.Miyatev, p. 100 Mavrodinov goes a step further to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.Miyatev, p. 157 The Round Church was unmatched in its ceramic decoration by any church in Preslav, and was the only known building in the city to rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles.Mango, p. 114 Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses. The Round Church featured marble and limestone cornices. These included a large number of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices.Vaklinov, pp. 212‚Äì213 Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes. Epigraphy Inscription of chartophylax Paul from the interior of the Round Church The Round Church contains many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its walls as graffiti. One study counted a total of 193 signs and 30 drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the epigraphy of the Round Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, as well as two languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic. Perhaps the most famous and valuable writing on the walls of the church is a Cyrillic inscription on the south wall of the premises south of the narthex, conventionally known as the baptistery. The inscription was clumsily written on top of a mortar putty and says in translation: \\"Church of Saint John, built by chartophylax Paul\\". Despite being dated to the 10th centuryVaklinov, p. 227 and its mention of the church's dedication and its potential donor, it cannot be described a classic donor's inscription because of its unnatural location and clumsy writing. Nikolova considers it more likely that the author of the inscription was a literate person who served under chartophylax Paul and desired to spread his fame. She believes the text may refer to the construction of the narthex only rather than the whole church, because she is of the opinion that the narthex may have been added after the building of the rotunda. Other examples of the epigraphy of the Round Church include several short Glagolitic and Cyrillic texts and separate letters. Among the Glagolitic inscriptions is the Preslav Abecedarium, a liturgical text including the first thirteen letters of that alphabet; some of the Cyrillic texts were written on ceramic tiles. The names and descriptions attached to the icons are in Greek, while there are also bilingual inscriptions in Greek and Bulgarian.Vaklinov, p. 226 Individual letters inscribed on the walls illustrate the way Greek and simplified Glagolitic letterforms were combined to form the early Cyrillic alphabet.Vlasto, p. 41 On the walls of the church are graffiti of Christian crosses, animals, and up to 11 depictions of ships.Rashev, p. 339 At least one epitaph has been discovered, inscribed on the tombstone of a woman described as \\"God's servant Tudora\\".

The Toba people are found in Toba Samosir Regency, Humbang Hasundutan Regency, Samosir Regency, North Tapanuli Regency, part of Dairi Regency, Central Tapanuli Regency, Sibolga and its surrounding regions. The Batak Toba people speak in the Toba Batak language and are centered on Lake Toba and Samosir Island within the lake. Batak Toba people frequently build in traditional Batak architecture styles which are common on Samosir. Cultural demonstrations, performances and festivities such as Sigale Gale are often held for tourists. Paleontological research done in Humbang region of the west side of Toba Lake suggests that human activity had existed 6,500 years ago, much earlier than the 800 years existence of King of Batak; and therefore the name \\"King of Toba\\" was coined for the early settlers of that region. This discovery also led to the theory of the possibility that the King of Toba could have originated from south India, Indochina (Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia and Formosa), South China and so on, even as far as the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.  History = Batak kingdoms  The seal of Sisingamangaraja dynasty. During the time when the Batak kingdom was based in Bakara, the Sisingamangaraja dynasty of the Batak kingdom divided their kingdom into four regions by the name of Raja Maropat, which are:- * Raja Maropat Silindung * Raja Maropat Samosir * Raja Maropat Humbang * Raja Maropat Toba  Dutch colonization  During the Dutch colonization, the Dutch formed Tapanuli Residency in 1910. The Tapanuli Residency is divided into four regions that is called afdeling (in Dutch language means, section); and today it is known as regency or city, namely:- * Afdeling Padang Sidempuan, which later became South Tapanuli Regency, Mandailing Natal Regency, Padang Lawas Regency, North Padang Lawas Regency and Padang Sidempuan. * Afdeling Nias, which later became Nias Regency and South Nias Regency. * Afdeling Sibolga and Ommnenlanden, today it is Central Tapanuli Regency and Sibolga. * Afdeling Bataklanden, which later became North Tapanuli Regency, Humbang Hasundutan Regency, Toba Samosir Regency, Samosir Regency, Dairi Regency and Pakpak Bharat Regency.  Japanese occupation  A group of Toba people, circa 1914-1919. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, the administration of the Tapanuli Residency had little changes.  Post independence of Indonesia  After the independence, the government of Indonesia retain Tapanuli as Residency. Dr. Ferdinand Lumban Tobing became the first Tapanuli Resident. Although there were changes made to the name, but the division of the region was still the same. For example, the name of Afdeling Bataklanden was changed to Luhak Tanah Batak and the first luhak (federated region) appointed was Cornelius Sihonbing; who was once also a Demang (chief) Silindung. The title Onderafdeling (in Dutch language means, subdivision) is also changed to urung, and demangs that surpervises onderafdeling are promoted as kepala (head) urung. Onderdistrik (subdistrict) then became urung kecil, and is supervised by kepala urung kecil; which was previously known as assistant demang. Just as it was in the past, the government of the Tapanuli Residency were divided into four districts, namely:- * Silindung Regency * Samosir Regency * Humbang Regency * Toba Regency  Transfer of sovereignty in early 1950  Toba head with his family in their home with beautifully carved head of Toba family (adathuis) Tapanoeli, North Sumatra, circa 1900. During the transfer of sovereignty in early 1950s, the Tapanuli Residency that was unified into North Sumatra province were divided into four new regencies, namely:- * North Tapanuli Regency (previously known as Tanah Batak Regency) * Central Tapanuli Regency (previously known as Sibolga Regency) * South Tapanuli Regency (previously known as Padang Sidempuan Regency) * Nias Regency  Present  In December 2008, the Tapanuli Residency was unified under North Sumatra province. At the moment, Toba is under the Toba Samosir Regency's region with Balige as its capital.  Culture  Tapanoeli. The Toba people practices a distinct culture. It is not a must for Toba people to live in Toba region, although their origin is from Toba. Just as it is with other ethnicities, the Toba people have also migrated to other places to look for better life. For example, majority of the Silindung natives are the Hutabarat, Panggabean, Simorangkir, Hutagalung, Hutapea and Lumbantobing clans. Instead all those six clans are actually descendants of Guru Mangaloksa, one of Raja Hasibuan's sons from Toba region. So it is with the Nasution clan where most of them live in Padangsidimpuan, surely share a common ancestor with their relative, the Siahaan clan in Balige. It is certain that the Toba people as a distinct culture can be found beyond the boundaries of their geographical origins. The region of Toba, known as \\"the king of Batak\\" is precisely Sianjur village situated on the slopes of Mount Pusuk Buhit, about 45 minutes drive from Pangururan, the capital of Samosir Regency today.  The Toba clan  Surname or family name is part of a Toba person's name, which identifies the family they belong. The Batak people always have a surname or family name. The surname or family name is obtained from the father's lineage (paternal) which would then be passed on to the offspring continuously. Pardede, Napitupulu, Panggabean, Siahaan, Sihombing, Sitorus, Pandjaitan, Marbun, Lumban Tobing, Aritonang, Pangaribuan, Hutapea and Simatupang are popular surnames.

It is a rectangular building that can house up to five or six families. One can enter a Rumah Bolon through a staircase in the middle of the house with odd numbers of steps (odd number of staircase means offspring of slave, even number of staircase means offspring of king). When a person enters the house, one must bow in order to avoid one's head from knocking the transverse beam at the entrance of the traditional house. The interpretation of this is that the guests must respect the owner of the house.  Boat  A Solu on lake Toba. Traditional boat of Toba Batak people is called solu, it is a dugout canoe, with boards added on the side bound with iron tacks.

Views of Toba people in Indonesian culture The Batak Toba are known throughout Indonesia as capable musicians, and are perceived as confident, outspoken and willing to question authority, expressing differences in order to resolve them through discussion. This outlook on life is contrasted to Javanese people, Indonesia's largest ethnic group, who are more culturally conciliatory and less willing to air differences publicly.http://ebooks.iaccp.org/ongoing_themes/chapters/chandra/chandra.php?file=chandra&output;=screen ReferencesExternal links *\\"A Brief Description of The Applying of Dalihan Na Tolu in Batak Toba Society,\\" available on the website of the Repositori Institusi Universitas Sumatera Utara http://repository.usu.ac.id/handle/123456789/16945  Further reading  * * Giglioli, Henry Hillyer (1893).

The game was first published by Superior Software and Acornsoft as part of the Play it Again Sam 9 compilation in 1989 and was subsequently re-published as a standalone title in 1990 by Superior Software and Blue Ribbon. Description In-game screenshot (BBC Micro) The game is very similar to Oakden's previous game Quest which itself has some elements in common with an earlier BBC/Electron title, Citadel. Camelot is also a platform adventure game set in a large flip-screen castle and the player also has a set amount of energy which runs down when in contact with enemy sprites or hazards. The backstory given in the cassette inlay indicates that the player (as the King) has been deposed from the throne for mismanaging the kingdom. To convince the people that the king deserves another chance to return to throne again, the player must fight their way through the castle and surrounding terrain, facing various enemies such as witches, warlocks and soldiers. To complete the quest, 3000 points are needed, which can be obtained by finding six bags of gold, scattered around the game. Each bag is worth 450 points, although the player can gain extra points by killing the enemy sprites. The player has four-way directional controls, left, right, up and down (for climbing ladders) and there are also separate keys for jump, firing a fireball, picking up objects and using a spell book. Energy can be replenished by finding hearts hidden in caskets, although some caskets contain daemons instead, which drain the player's energy. The game does have a time limit, but extra time is gained by opening doors and solving puzzles, so the player must work out a logical sequence of puzzle-solving such that the clock does not run down to zero. The game is considered quite challenging, although a small program has been written by C.J.

The series is the first installment in a series of four television series about the early Qing dynasty. It was followed by Huang Taizi Mishi (2004), Taizu Mishi (2005) and Secret History of Kangxi (2006), all of which were also produced by You Xiaogang. Plot Dayu'er is a Khorchin Mongol princess who is deeply in love with Dorgon- one of the several sons of Nurhaci, a Jurchen chieftain. Yet, she soon becomes the concubine of Dorgon's older brother Hong Taiji. Hong Taiji is already married to Dayu'er's aunt Jerjer to secure the alliance between the Khorchin Mongols and Later Jin. Hong Taiji initially has feelings for Dayu'er, but realizes that she only loves Dorgon, so he directs his affections to her sister, Harjol. Hong Taiji later becomes the founder of the Qing Dynasty, with the help of Dorgon and other brother Dodo. Dorgon and Hong Taiji have a strained relationship because of Dayu'er and the forced suicide of Dorgon's mother, Lady Abahai. After Hong Taiji's death, Dayu'er son Fulin becomes Emperor and is assisted by Dorgon. Fulin suspects that his mother and Dorgon have a love affair and strips Dorgon of his power.

The group was formed in Connecticut in 1956 by Claire Lane (born Claire Litke) and her brother Rich Litke. Claire played drums, sang, and arranged the songs; Rich played saxophone. They added Vinny Lee on lead guitar, and Gene Moore on second guitar. At the end of 1960, they recorded their instrumental arrangement of \\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\\", a song written by Stan Jones which had been a big hit in 1949 for Vaughn Monroe. The Ramrods' version contained eerie and evocative overdubbed shouts, whistles and cattle calls, and was placed with Amy Records, a subsidiary of Bell Records in New York City. The Ramrods at Black Cat Rockabilly The record was made a \\"Pick of the Week\\" by Cash Box magazine, and rose to # 30 on the Billboard pop chart in early 1961. Released on the London label, it also reached # 8 on the UK pop chart. The follow-up, \\"Loch Lomond Rock\\", a rocked-up version of a traditional Scottish tune, with bagpipes solo, was not successful, and nor were two later singles on the Amy label. Gene Moore left the group in the early 1960s and was replaced by Russ Cook (born Russ Mumma) on bass. Vinny Lee later died and was replaced by Bernie Moore (no relation to Gene Moore), who was in turn later replaced by George Sheck, with Cook taking over on lead guitar. Claire Lane left the group in the late 1960s to pursue a solo career, and the remaining Ramrods became the Russ Cook Combo before disbanding in the early 1970s. A later (early- to mid-60s) \\"garage-rock\\" band from the Boston area, originally called The Rockin' Ramrods, later shortened their name to just The Ramrods, and had a series of 45s out on various local labels --- but this was a completely different band (formed by two brothers from Revere, Massachusetts) with no affiliation to the Connecticut Ramrods. Besides the similarity and eventual uniformity of names, confusion between the two different outfits is exacerbated by the Boston Rockin' Ramrods' first 45 being two instrumentals.

Founded in 1998 by students of Laval University (Quebec, Canada), it has become a reference for models on both sides of the Atlantic. Since its first edition, the SPECQUE has developed the double ambition of promoting the major issues of European current affairs and of giving its participants an inside look into the functioning of the European Parliament. Beyond these academic goals, the SPECQUE allows students from all over Europe and Canada to broaden their horizons by exchanging ideas and opinions.  The model  In its 15 year history, the SPECQUE has established itself as a reference model for both Canadian and European institutions. In 2011, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Quebec‚Äôs Ministry of International Relations endorsed the initiative. On top of this, support was gathered amongst many politicians, such as Jean-Claude JUNCKER, Luxembourg Prime Minister and President of the Eurogroup, Marc JAEGER, President of the General Court of the ECJ, His Excellency Matthias BRINKMANN, Ambassador, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Canada. With its particular atmosphere, bringing together work and pleasure, the SPECQUE allows the emergence of an international, dynamic, enthusiastic and motivated student network, intending to play a major role in society. As a model parliament, the SPECQUE also helps its participants to develop their public speaking skills, cultivate a sense of initiative and learn the art of persuasion. They also gain the ability to thoroughly analyze sensitive issues and approach them under a legislative angle. The model also allows participants to meet young people from different environments and cultures, thus acquiring an open- mindedness that is invaluable in a context of globalization. The simulation is organized by the Association SPECQUE, a non-profit organization based in Quebec, but also represented in Europe. This association is governed by a Board of thirteen members, all of whom have participated at least once in the model. The Board consists of executive members who take charge of the organization of the event, and of non-executive members who handle the broad guidelines of the association, while ensuring its financial health and sustainability.  Functioning  During the week of the model, participants wear the shoes of those involved in European political life. While most are Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), some will be European Commissioners or members of the Council of the EU, President or Secretary-General of Parliament, Rapporteurs, heads of a political group, chairman or secretary of commission... But the model would not be the same without its journalists (newspaper, TV news, blog) and its lobbyists. All are brought to take part in discussions on four topics relating to the current affairs of Europe. Some of the recurring areas of interest include safety, economy, foreign trade, company law, social affairs, health or European defense. The discussion of the four topics is submitted to a legislative process, divided up between, plenary sessions and in-depth committee work. After much political plotting, on the last day, participants finally vote on the four texts and their amendments. It is also when that the motions presented by the MEPs are put to a vote. As this model stays true to the actual European Parliament procedure, the participants are able to assimilate the decision-making processes of European democracy. Also, the model‚Äôs rules are based on the real Rules of order of the European Parliament. Such a parallelism allows an even stronger immersion in the authentic parliamentary customs and habits.  Impact of the Model  The SPECQUE contributes to the promotion of the European Union and its institutions to a targeted audience: students in colleges and universities, as well as the academic community and other institutional or private partners. In this way, the SPECQUE strengthens the interest for European institutions. The debates allow a direct exchange of knowledge, which reinforces the understanding of the political system of each of the participants‚Äô respective country. This ultimately brings each to see their own system with a more critical outlook. Partaking in the SPECQUE represents a long term engagement and requires particular knowledge of EU institutions and legislative processes. Preparation is necessary in order to actively participate in the model. The impact of the participants‚Äô work and its sustainability are particularly consolidated by the transmission of all of the MEPs‚Äô amended reports to the SPECQUE‚Äôs private and institutional partners.

It is the central business district of the town of Hervey Bay, which is located in the Hinkler federal division. It is the location of one of the transmitters for ABC Wide Bay.  History  The area was originally known as Point Vernon, until a town was surveyed and named Polson. On 19 March 1931 the town name was changed to Pialba, reflecting the long existing use of that name. The Hervey Bay railway line from Maryborough to Pialba opened on 18 December 1896. It was used to transport harvested sugarcane to the Maryborough Sugar Mill in addition to daily passenger trains. An extension to Urangan and the Urangan Pier opened in 19 December 1913. As the Pialba railway station was built so close to the beach, it was not possible to extend the line directly from the Pialba station. A junction was added before the Pialba station and the trains had to reverse out of the station in order to take the junction to Urangan. From 10 June 1929 a railmotor was used to operate the passenger services. Pialba State School opened on 30 July 1884. Urangan Road State School opened in 1915. In 1956 it was renamed Bingham Road State School (Bingham was the former name of River Heads). It closed in 1960. Hervey Bay State High School opened on 28 January 1964.

The club currently participates in the Basketball League of Serbia. The team play domestic home matches in the Veliki Park Sports Hall. History The story began in November 1949 when a group of high school students become interested in basketball. Soon they played two friendly matches, and in January 1950 the first basketball tournament was held in Titovo U≈æice. Same year two basketball sections were formed, one at the City Gymnastic Society, and the other at the Sports Association \\"Prvi partizan\\".

Stirchley was formerly a separate village but is now part of the new town of Telford. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The churchyard is designated as a Scheduled ancient monument. History The church was built in the 12th century. In about 1740 the masonry of the nave and tower was encased in brick, and the tower was heightened. A north aisle was added in 1838 for the use of the workers in the local Old Park Ironworks, owned by Thomas Botfield. The church was declared redundant on 1 November 1975, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 30 March 2006. Architecture=Exterior The plan of the church is simple, consisting of a nave with a north aisle, a chancel, and a west tower. The chancel is in Norman style, and constructed in squared yellow sandstone blocks. The nave and tower are in Georgian style, and constructed in red brick with sandstone dressings. The chancel has round- headed lancet windows, and one south window with Y-tracery. In the nave there are two round-headed windows, and there a more round-headed windows in the north aisle. The tower is in three stages. In the bottom stage is a round- headed west doorway, and above it in the middle stage is a large round-headed window. The top stage has round-headed bell openings on each side. On the summit of the tower is a pyramidal roof with a finial and a weathervane. Interior The most impressive internal structure is the Norman chancel arch. It consists of two orders of shafts and three orders of voussoirs, and is decorated with carvings of chain links, rosettes in lozenges, and two types of chevrons. The capitals are carved with scallops and foliage. The architectural historians John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner describe the arch as being \\"quite incongruously ornate\\". Also in the church is a west gallery with a balustraded front, and a north gallery with tiered seating. The pulpit, reading desk, and box pews all date from about 1740, and were rearranged in 1838. There is brass plaque to men of Stirchley who died serving World War I, as well as a row of four shields bearing each a name, three to men who died in the latter war, and one in World War II. The church also preserves a huge wooden roll of honour of men who served in World War I which was moved from St Luke's Church, Doseley (closed 1975). There is a ring of three bells. These were cast in 1410 by John de Colsale, in 1594 by Henry II Oldfield, and in 1664 by Thomas II Clibury.

It appears on Neil's 1968 album Velvet Gloves and Spit, and was released as an A-side with a B-side of \\"Broad Old Woman (6 a.m. Insanity)\\". It is a \\"strong and interesting\\" song according to Robert Jamieson. \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\" also appears on the Neil Diamond compilation albums Glory Road 1968-1972, Play Me: The Complete Uni Studio Recordings Plus, Gold, and Reflections. The site Allmusic recommends \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\" as one of the top four songs on the album Velvet Gloves and Spit, calling it, \\"a fascinating adaptation of his Brill Building-era sound to a personal/introspective lyric and approach (picture the Monkees' sound melded to a singer/songwriter persona).\\" It has also been described as \\"brilliant and very Bang-ish\\" and a \\"jewel\\". The opening riff is also reminiscent of Day Tripper by The Beatles. Debut Neil Diamond performed \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\" on July 2, 1968, on Showcase 68. Officially released as a 45 single in July, 1968 with the B-Side \\"Broad Old Woman (6 a.m. Insanity)\\" as UNI 55075. It eventually reached #66 on the charts. At least two versions of the 45 sleeve were released. One featured a picture of Neil Diamond. The other featured a swirly, psychedelic graphic. It was arranged by Renzetti, Altman, Cerone, Richards and Sandler. International release In the United Kingdom, \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\" was also released with Broad Old Woman (6 a.m. Insanity) as the B-Side. It was released by MCA records in August 1968, and licensed by MCA INC. USA as UK MCA MU 1033. It did not chart in the U.K. Subsequent history The copyright has been registered twice, first as EP0000284487 on December 12, 1970, and again as RE0000772415 on January 2, 1998. The poor chart performance of \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\" forebode the poor chart performance of Velvet Gloves and Spit. \\"Two- Bit Manchild\\" is now considered one of the \\"obscurities\\" of Neil Diamond's catalog. \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\" was covered by Australian pop singer Johnny Farnham on his second studio album Everybody Oughta Sing a Song released on EMI Records in November 1968. The song is now covered by the Neil Diamond coverers Nine Inch Neils, and Mike Tyler. Non-performance on American Idol On April 29, 2008, contestants on American Idol sang Neil Diamond penned songs. One song they did not perform was \\"Two-Bit Manchild\\". Perhaps, as New York suggested, it was too \\"on-the-nose.\\" Some were \\"desperate\\" that David Cook perform it.

Smith, they create the GaWC's bi-annual categorization of world cities into \\"Alpha\\", \\"Beta\\" and \\"Gamma\\" tiers, based upon their international connectedness.  GaWC city classification  The GaWC examines cities worldwide to narrow them down to a roster of world cities, then ranks these based on their connectivity through four \\"advanced producer services\\": accountancy, advertising, banking/finance, and law. The GaWC inventory ranks city economics more heavily than political or cultural factors . Beyond the categories of \\"Alpha\\" world cities (with four sub-categories), \\"Beta\\" world cities (three sub-categories), and \\"Gamma\\" world cities (three sub-categories), the GaWC cities include additional cities at \\"High sufficiency\\" and \\"Sufficiency\\" level. The 2004 rankings added several new indicators while continuing to rank city economics more heavily than political or cultural factors. The 2008 roster, similar to the 1998 version, is sorted into categories of Alpha world cities (with four sub-categories), Beta world cities (three sub-categories), Gamma world cities (three sub-categories), and additional cities with High sufficiency or Sufficiency presence.  2020 city classification  The cities in the 2020 classification are as follows.

The film deals with underworld criminal nexus, and hijacking. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu for that year. The film was remade in Tamil as Naam (2003) and in Malayalam as Wanted (2004). The film was dubbed and released in Hindi as 50 Lakh in 2007. Plot Irfan Khan (Pavan Malhotra) is a key mafia affiliate in Mumbai. Khan is on the wanted list of criminals in Hyderabad, India with a bounty of 50 lakhs. Aiming to migrate to Dubai so that he can remotely control the operations in Mumbai, Khan devises a plan of getting four of his own men to hijack a domestic flight from Hyderabad to Kathmandu (destined for Mumbai) in which he is a passenger. The Home Minister of Maharashtra (Narsing Yadav) is also in the flight, and the four men are to release all the passengers and concentrate on the Home Minister. From Kathmandu, he plans to go to Dubai. For the hijack, he organises a group of four intelligent men who are in dire need for money and who do not have a criminal record. The audience is made to believe in the beginning that the four central characters are these four men, but in fact they kidnap Khan before the flight takes off, aiming to get the prize money. They hide Khan in a forest and call the Assistant Commissioner of Police, who is a double agent for the mafia. When the ACP does not yield (as he wants them to release Khan), one of the four, Kumar (Shashank), makes a deal with the Mafia and obtains a bag with 2 crores. However, the bag in which the money is kept in has a bomb in it. When Kumar tells the others that he has done this, they back out, and he joins with them, just in time. Meanwhile, Khan's assistant, Musharraf (Veerendra Chowhan), comes and takes Khan from the forest, but is stopped by IB agent Zaheer Khan (Sivaji Raja), who has been following the four men and Musharraf throughout the movie. Finally, the four friends come back to their house. They find a bag, which they had lost previously. With that they find a note from Zaheer explaining everything. The bag also has, to their joy, their prize money.

The episode was the first Halloween special of the series. Plot Cleveland Jr. dresses up as a pancake for Halloween and wants to go out trick-or-treating. But Cleveland says that he is too old for trick-or-treating. So he leaves him home to pass out candy. Meanwhile, Cleveland goes trick-or-treating with Donna, Rallo, and Roberta. After giving candy to a trick-or-treater dressed as Harry Potter, Junior decides to go trick-or-treating anyway. He puts on his pancake suit and goes out, only for a gang of popular bullies from his school led by football team captain, Oliver Wilkerson, to egg him and vandalize the outside of the Browns' house and Halloween decorations. The Browns get back from trick-or- treating, they see that their house vandalized. A battered pumpkin told them that Cleveland Jr. left. Later on, Cleveland talks to Junior about what happened. Cleveland and Donna go into Junior's room and sees that he is giving away all of his childhood toys. Donna suggests that he should stop him from getting rid of what defines him. Later on, Cleveland changes Junior's personality and appearance to make him like a rapper. He acts differently, which makes Donna believe that he is not happy. In bed, Junior looks at his old pictures of him and his stuffed animals, and says that he misses his old self. When Roberta announces she is attending Oliver Wilkerson's party, Junior goes too in an effort to launch his new personality as a cool kid. However, when Cleveland drives to the party to check on him, he sees Oliver and his friends still bullying him. Donna says that Cleveland has created a monster out of Junior. and Cleveland decides to change him back. He brings Junior's stuffed leopard and pancake costume back so he can help him figure out who he really is. They then go trick-or-treating with Cleveland's friends. They throw toilet paper at Oliver's house and start throwing eggs at him and his gang in retaliation for their cruelty towards Junior. Meanwhile, Rallo decides on eating too much candy, without listening to what his mother said about not overdoing it. He grows to have a big stomach full of candy. Then, he decided to eat one last piece of candy, which causes his tooth to break off. Rallo figures that Donna was right about his teeth rotting out. Rallo is trying to figure out where to hide his broken tooth so Donna would not find out about it. He hides it under his pillow and finds a quarter under it the next day. He ends up telling Donna about what happened and she explains what happened when Rallo's tooth was taken, inspiring Rallo to try to gain further visits after newly discovering the Tooth Fairy. Production The episode was written by series regular Aseem Batra and directed by series regular Ron Rubio before the conclusion of the second production season. The episode was the first Halloween special of the series.

Reception \\"It's the Great Pancake, Cleveland Brown\\" was broadcast on November 7, 2010, as a part Animation Domination line-up of animated television on FOX following The Simpsons \\"Treehouse of Horror XXI\\". It was watched by 6.70 million viewers in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. Despite being up against 60 Minutes and the opening kickoff of Sunday Night Football, the episode received a season's high mark of 3.1 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, placing it 3rd in its time slot and 3rd in the FOX animation sequence with slightly higher viewership than the American Dad! episode that followed. In total viewership, the episode was up 19.0% from the previous episode, \\"How Cleveland Got His Groove Back\\", which aired on October 10, 2010 and had a viewership of 5.63 million. TV Squad's Jason Hughs imagined young Seth McFarland \\"...wanting to dress up for Halloween but being told by his parents that he's too old and he'll get made fun of\\" and \\"...getting bullied by the bigger kids and being robbed of his candy.\\" so the episode has Cleveland Jr. getting picked on for being \\"...too young and too old for trick-or-treating\\" while later joining his father and cohorts in bullying smaller kids and throwing eggs at Oliver. Jason Hughes loved the punchline to the egg throwing when Cleveland tells Jr that \\"...he was on his own for the repercussions of their actions.\\". In a combined review of the FOX animation block, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club liked how consistent Cleveland Jr. is during the life of the series but gave the episode a 'C', saying: \\"...focusing the show's Halloween episode on the idea that Cleveland, Jr., was at that awkward age between being young enough to go trick or treating and old enough to dress up for Halloween parties was a good choice. [...] the rest of the episode was [...] a King of the Hill-esque story about how Cleveland doesn't really understand his son.\\" and \\"...too much of the episode was only worth a bored shrug [...] though I did like Roberta as a slutty ghost\\".

The film was sensitive to the visible light spectrum (with decreased green sensitivity), infrared radiation up to 900nm in wavelength, and some ultraviolet radiation as well. The prominent blooming or \\"glow\\" often seen in the highlights of infrared photographs is an artifact of HIE and not of infrared light itself (nor even of all IR-sensitive films). This is because conventional photographic films have an anti-halation layer that absorbs scattered light, while HIE lacks this backing. As a result, Kodak HIE (which also had a completely transparent base, whereas most films have slightly gray bases) had to be loaded and unloaded in total darkness. Light can enter the film through the tail protruding from a 35mm canister and without a gray base it will be piped into the film and expose it; without an anti-halation layer any light entering the substrate through the emulsion will be reflected back and forth inside the film, becoming diffuse as it travels and causing halation. Nonetheless, HIE was produced without a gray base and anti-halation layers so that sensitivity would be increased by allowing light to reflect back and forth, and because it was difficult to find any way of treating the film that would be effective at infrared wavelengths. HIE featured a polyester film base that was very stable but susceptible to scratches, and therefore required extra care during development, processing and scanning. Discontinuation As of November 2, 2007, \\"Kodak is preannouncing the discontinuance\\" of HIE Infrared 35 mm film stating the reasons that, \\"Demand for these products has been declining significantly in recent years, and it is no longer practical to continue to manufacture given the low volume, the age of the product formulations and the complexity of the processes involved.\\"Kodak, Discontinuance notice\\"Due to declining demand, Kodak High-Speed Infrared Film / HIE has been discontinued, effective YE 2007.\\"; Kodak, At the time of this notice, HIE Infrared 135-36 was available at a street price of around $12 a roll at US mail order outlets. Despite the discontinuance of HIE, other newer infrared sensitive emulsions from Rollei and Ilford are still available, but have differing sensitivity and specifications from the long-established HIE.

Franco shot the film in 1971, but it was only released in 1973 after some additional erotic footage was added to the film without Franco's involvement. It was later re-cut with some extra zombie footage and redistributed to theaters again in 1981 as a zombie film. It has since been restored on DVD to Franco's original director's cut. Plot A beautiful young woman named Christina arrives in Europe to visit her estranged relatives in a small castle for the reading of her dead father's will. She eventually discovers that they are all undead, and they fear that when she inherits her father's mansion, she will ask them all to leave. But Christina is lonely and tells her Uncle Howard that she wants them all to remain there and live with her. She learns that a spirit called the Queen of the Night has claimed her father's eternal soul because he committed suicide by hanging himself. Christina winds up becoming one of the living dead herself, and at the end of the film, she and the rest of the family all solemnly march off into a swamp on the grounds of the estate, accompanied by the Queen of the Night. CastProduction Franco shot the film in 1971 in Portugal, where he said he had the full cooperation of the local authorities, and total license to film the outdoor nude scenes. Franco stated in interviews that this was one of his favorite films because he felt the plot was \\"so imaginative and interesting\\", the actors were so enthusiastic to work with him and it was made at a very happy time in his life. Franco himself played a co-starring role in this film as a mindless cretin named Basilio who walks the corridors talking in gibberish to a severed chicken's head. Franco's then-wife Nicole Guettard had a small role in the film's framing sequence as a nurse According to Franco, the original shooting title of his film was The Night of the Shooting Stars (La nuit des √©toiles filantes), the title he always preferred. It was released in France, however, in 1973 as Christina, Princess of Eroticism, and in Italy in 1978 as The Erotic Dreams of Christine; both versions contained new porn inserts directed by Pierre Querut at the behest of Comptoir Francais, featuring Alice Arno wearing a mask and leading three couples to have sex in an outdoor setting, added to the film without Franco's consent. Franco was not involved in filming the padded sex scenes. This x-rated version ran 90 minutes due to the added Alice Arno footage. In 1981, producer Marius Lesoeur hired French horror film director Jean Rollin to direct some newly filmed zombie footage that was added to Franco's film for its 1981 re-release, under the new title A Virgin Among the Living Dead. At this time, the English dubbing was also recorded, the Alice Arno porn footage was cut out, and the film was released on VHS. The film was released years later on DVD with the 1981 Jean Rollin zombie footage removed and the film finally restored to the way Franco originally shot it, but the film's title on the DVD remained A Virgin Among the Living Dead, a title which Franco abhorred. Home media releases The film was first released on VHS in the United States as A Virgin Among the Living Dead by Wizard Video (the 1981 re-release with the added Rollin zombie footage included.) The film was released the same way on DVD in the United States by Image Entertainment in 2003 as part of their EuroShock horror line. On August 20, 2013, a Blu-ray edition, containing Franco's original director's cut, was made available by Redemption. Rollin's zombie footage is on the disc as well as an extra feature separate from the film. Alternative titles include: A comme apocalypse; Among the Living Dead; Christina chez les morts vivants; Christina, princesse de l'erotisme; Christina, Sex Princess; La nuit des etoiles filantes; Los suenos eroticos de Christine; and Zombie 4 Reception Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle called it \\"one of the most infamously mutilated underground favorites\\", and said the original Franco version is the best cut of the film. Chris Alexander of Fangoria called the original Franco cut \\"a loose, atmospheric masterpiece of pure cinema\\". Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote that the Kino-Redemption release is \\"a triumph for Franco fans, though unlikely to appeal outside that demographic\\". Bill Gibron of DVD Talk rated it 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"a truly unnerving experience representing Franco at his most visually arresting\\". Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called it \\"an atrophied psychological horror, which is over-stylish and impressionistic to the point of incoherence\\".

After becoming a widow, she returned to her homeland and was the regent of Asturias from 1153 to 1165. Urraca was involved in a rebellion against her half-brother, King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n and with her second husband, √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez de Castro attempted to secure the independence of Asturias. Early life and family An illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VII and his mistress Gontrodo P√©rez, Urraca was born in 1133 in Pel√∫gano, one year after her parents had a relationship while the king was still married to Berengaria of Barcelona and coinciding with the rebellion of Count Gonzalo Pel√°ez, and one year before the birth of the legitimate heir, Sancho, born in 1134. Her maternal grandparents were members of the highest ranks of the Asturian nobility, her maternal grandfather, Pedro D√≠az de Valle, being a descendant of several counts and his wife, Mar√≠a Ord√≥√±ez, a direct descendant of the Infantes Ordo√±o Ram√≠rez and his wife Cristina Berm√∫dez. Her mother Gontrodo separated from Alfonso and joined a convent a year after Urraca's birth, and Urraca was raised in the court by her paternal aunt, Infanta Sancha Raim√∫ndez. Queen consort of Navarre Urraca was first married in Le√≥n on 24 June 1144 to Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre. This was a second marriage for Garcia as his first troubled marriage to Marguerite de l'Aigle had ended with her death just a month before Garcia's second marriage to Urraca that was arranged to strengthen Garcia's relationship with his overlord, Urraca's father. The couple were married for only six years before Garcia's death on 21 November 1150. Garcia was succeeded by his son with Marguerite de l'Aigle, Sancho VI of Navarre. Urraca's half-sister Sancha married Sancho and succeeded her as queen consort of Navarre. Regent of Asturias and second marriage The queen dowager Urraca returned to her homeland after her husband Garcia's death in 1150, being sent by her father to govern Asturias. In Oviedo, Urraca took up residence in the Palace of Alfonso II of Asturias, which was next to the Cathedral of Oviedo. Her father gave her properties, including the lordship of Aller. Queen Urraca ruled Asturias from 1153 until 1165; she even retained power after the death of her father in 1157. Sometime before 1163, Urraca remarried to √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez de Castro, son of Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Castro and Elo √Ålvarez. √Ålvaro was seigneur of Chantada and governor of Asturias between 1150 and 1171, of Sarria, and of the towers of Le√≥n, as well as the alf√©rez of King Fernando II and later his mayordomo mayor. A charter from the Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo in 1163 is dated: Alvaro Roderici cum uxore sua regina Urraca Asturias imperante (\\"Alvaro Rodr√≠guez with his wife Urraca governing Asturias\\") and another charter from 1165 from the Monastery of San Salvador in Celorio also mentions that Queen Urraca was governing Asturias with her husband √Ålvaro. Urraca and √Ålvaro were involved in an uprising to secure the independence of Asturias as attested in a charter from the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Otero de las Due√±as which mentions \\"...when Queen do√±a Urraca and don √Ålvaro Roderici wanted King Fernando II to lose Asturias\\". In the early months of 1164, King Fernando II thanked the Bishop of Oviedo for the aid provided to quash the uprising in Asturias. This period was highlighted by their generosity with the Church in Asturias, to which they made numerous donations, notably those at the Cathedral of Oviedo, as well as those made to the monastery of San Pelayo de Oviedo. Urraca collaborated with her mother in founding the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de la Vega in the outskirts of Oviedo where Gontrodo was eventually buried in a tomb the marker of which is currently preserved in the Archaeological Museum of the Asturias. Death Urraca died at Palencia sometime after 1164 but the exact date of her death is unknown. Some chroniclers placed her death on October 26, 1164, but this is impossible, since she appeared with her second husband in 1165 in a charter in the Monastery of San Salvador de Celorio, and then again on 25 February 1178 at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Sandoval when she made a donation and asked to be buried there. Although other sources place her death in 1189, according to the Anales toledanos she died in 1179.

The route to Lake Chad was mainly through Sudanian Savanna, grasslands with scattered trees to the south of the drier Sahel. Parfait-Louis Monteil (1855 ‚Äì 29 September 1925) was a French colonial military officer and explorer who made an epic journey in West Africa between 1890 and 1892, travelling east from Senegal to Lake Chad, and then north across the Sahara to Tripoli. Early career French Fort of Bamako 1883 Monteil was the older brother of Charles Monteil (1871‚Äì1949), who became a distinguished ethologist. Monteil was a graduate of the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He served in Senegal, where his duties included cartographical surveys. In 1884 he was made a member of the Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie de Paris and in 1886 became an officer of the society. He was influenced by the former governor of Senegal, Louis Faidherbe, whom he regularly visited in his apartment (where Faidherbe was confined by paralysis) in the middle 1880s. Monteil served in the French protectorate of Annam, now part of Vietnam, from 1886 to 1888. He then spent time investigating a railway project to link Bafoulab√© and Bamako in Senegal, before launching on his great journey across West Africa in 1890. Political background The conference of Berlin (1884‚Äì1885) France, Britain, Germany, Portugal and Italy came to a broad agreement on the way in which they would divide up the continent of Africa at the 1884‚Äì1885 Berlin Conference. France gained primacy in the bulk of West Africa from Algeria and Tunisia south across the Sahara and the Sahel into the Sudanian Savanna. The other powers could extend their coastal colonies north from the Gulf of Guinea into the interior. In the case of Britain, these colonies included the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Lagos colony and the territory claimed by the Royal Niger Company. On 5 August 1890 the British and French concluded an agreement to clarify the boundary between French West Africa and what would become Nigeria. Britain would acquire all territories up to and including the Sokoto Caliphate, while the French would take the lands further to the north. However, they did not know the extent of the Sokoto Caliphate. Monteil was given charge of an expedition to discover its northern limits. From Senegal to Tripoli via Chad Colonial Saint Louis c. 1900. Europeans and Africans on the Rue Lebon. Colonel Monteil and a small party of Frenchmen arrived in Dakar in September 1890. He traveled by railway up the coast to St. Louis where he hired bearers and tirailleurs. He continued his journey up the S√©n√©gal River by steamer, arriving on 18 October 1890 at Kayes, where he bought equipment and horses. Monteil reached S√©gou on the upper Niger River on 14 December, the last outpost of the French in the Sudan. The countries to the east were known to be Moslem, were rumored to be rich in gold, slaves and ivory, but were uncharted territory to Europeans. Landscape between Dori and Yalgo Monteil set out eastwards, generally obtaining a friendly reception and signing treaties of friendship, although suffering from heat, mosquitos and lack of drinking water. The Almami of San signed a peace treaty placing the town under French protection. Monteil praised the caravan center at San, saying that transactions could be made in total security, with no duties levied on imports, exports or sales. Entering what is now Burkina Faso, Monteil wanted Wobogo, the Mogho Naba of Mossy and ruler of Ouagadougou, to agree to a French protectorate. Wobogo refused to receive him, and he was forced to make a hurried departure. He reached Dori, the capital of Liptako, on 22 May 1891, at a time when the Amiirou, Amadou Iisa, was dying, and became involved in a dispute over succession. Monteil started to negotiate a treaty with the followers of Issa, son of the Amiirou and next in line, but the Amiirous's nephew Sori managed to gain the support needed to become the next ruler. 1850 steel engraving of Kano In June Monteil went on to Sebba, capital of Yagha, where after a considerable payment to the \\"greedy\\" ruler another treaty was agreed. From there he travelled via Torodi to Say, a large commercial town on the Niger River, and then onward to Sokoto via the Argungu triangle. He observed that the Kebbi Argungu Emirate was independent of the Sokoto Caliphate. This later became a point of dispute between the French and British authorities. Further, he found little evidence that the Royal Niger Company was present in the region as claimed, apart from some trading posts in the Gwandu Emirate to the south of Argundu. Monteil was welcomed by the Caliph of Sokoto, Abd ar-Rahman dan Abi Bakar, who at the time was engaged in a war with the Emir of Argungu. He signed a treaty with the Caliph on 28 October 1891, and presented him with silks, brocades, embroidered caftans and money. He said the state of the Caliphate was precarious when he visited, but may have overestimated the combined effects of the war and the recent accession of an unpopular ruler. Shortly after Monteil left, Sokoto defeated Argungu. Kanembu warriors of Bornu and their mounted chief in an illustration from H. Barth's Travels and Discoveries Vol III, 1857. Monteil journeyed from Sokoto to the important trading center of Kano, a city full of shrewd merchants and skilled artisans, then via Hadejia to Lake Chad. On 9 April 1892 he reached Kuka on the shore of the lake, where he was met by a group of 150 cavalrymen arrayed in colorful costumes, with their horses dressed in padded caparisons. The horsemen charged him with spears leveled, stopping at the last minute, a sign of respect and also a test of courage. He exchanged courtesies with the Sultan of Bornu, and was his guest for several months while he explored the country around the lake ‚Äì and while the Sultan tried to extract gifts in exchange for a safe conduct. When finally allowed to depart, he traveled northward across the Sahara to Tripoli, reaching the Mediterranean on 10 December 1892. His journey had done much to clarify for Europeans, and for France in particular, the geography and politics of the region. Within 15 years, almost all the territory Monteil had visited was firmly under colonial control. Later career After Monteil's return to France, in 1893 the Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie awarded him the Grand Gold Medal for his book recording the journey. The successful expedition across West Africa impressed the statesman Th√©ophile Delcass√©, who took Monteil to meet the President of France, Sadi Carnot on 4 May 1893. Carnot wanted Monteil to undertake an expedition to Fashoda on the upper Nile, but on 30 May Delcass√© sent him to the French Congo to reinforce Haut-Oubangui (now the Central African Republic) against Belgian intrusions. He arrived at the port of Luango on 24 August 1894, planning to travel first to Ubangi and then onwards to the Nile. Before starting for the interior, however, he was urgently reassigned to the Ivory Coast to help deal with the threat from the imam-warrior Samori Ture. In September 1894 he directed an expedition into Baoul√© country in the Ivory Coast, reaching Tiassal√© in December before being turned back by fierce opposition north of the city. The Governor of French Sudan, Albert Grodet, took some of the blame for the fiasco. Later, Monteil tried without success to enter politics, and was involved in colonization of the south of Tunisia. He died at Herblay, Seine- et-Oise in 1925.

Its widest part is 125 to 175 km (75 to 105 miles) east of Flamborough Head in England. It is between the Dogger Bank and the ridge dividing the northern from the southern North Sea basins, which runs between Norfolk and Friesland. When the sea level was lower (such as in the Ice Age) it was a lake in Doggerland, and sea-bed-penetrating sonar bathymetry has found its shorelines and courses and estuaries of rivers that ran into it from the high land of the Dogger Bank; it overflowed into a river at its west end.Mapping Doggerland, ed. Vincent Gaffney and others, publ. Archaeopress 2007, Wherever the rivers may have run in the southern North Sea, the Outer Silver Pit will not have been initiated by the rivers. One of the other theories must be looked to for that. Bed of the Rhine? In the Cromerian Stage, before more recent glaciation had influenced the area, a ridge of high ground, the Weald-Artois Anticline, joined the Upper Cretaceous chalk in Kent, England to that of the Boulonnais at Cap Blanc-Nez in the Pas de Calais, France. It is possible that in the Cromerian Stage, the Outer Silver Pit was the bed of the combined Maas, Rhine, Scheldt and Thames. Since at that stage, the Weald-Artois Anticline had probably not been breached by the glacial lake outburst floods that scoured the Strait of Dover, the southern North Sea basin held a freshwater lake impounded by the ridge of the Weald-Artois Anticline and by the Norfolk- Friesland ridge. Whether the lake spilled north through the Outer Silver Pit would depend on how much the modern sea bed to the north has been raised by later marine and glacial sediment, and how much the various parts of the area were raised by forebulge effect caused by the weight of the Scandinavian ice cap. The east end of the Outer Silver Pit is in line with the lowest part of the Norfolk-Friesland ridge. The outlet at the western end of the pit appears to be blocked by somewhat higher ground. Bed of the Urstrom? There is an older theory that the Outer Silver Pit was part of the valley of the great ice-age river Urstrom, during some of the Ice Ages when the Scandinavian ice did not meet the British ice, leaving the North Sea bed with open drainage northwards. Maps by some geologists show rivers from the German part of the Urstrom's catchment area flowing northwards east of the Dogger Bank highland area; but Scandinavian ice reaching the Dogger Bank would have forced the Urstrom into another route. When the Scandinavian and Scottish ice caps first met, the Urstrom (unless it found a way northwards under the ice) would have backed up into a huge lake in the southern North Sea, which finally found an outlet southwards over the Weald-Artois Anticline and helped to cut the valley of the Strait of Dover: see Strait of Dover#Geological formation.

HMS Bacchante. On boats, particularly wooden boats, brightwork is exposed metal and varnished woodworking, though amongst the yachting set it more often refers to the woodwork. The metal is usually brass or bronze that is kept polished, or stainless steel, which requires less maintenance.http://www.yourdictionary.com/brightwork In the past, due to the environmental exposure experienced by boats, corrosion and UV damage made maintaining brightwork both Sisyphean and extremely labor-intensive. However, with the development of improved UV-absorbers and filters in the chemical composition of the various marine varnishes (spar varnish, polyurethane, or linear polyurethane), this work is not as intensive as it once was. Varnished finishes are maintained by sanding and re-finishing, and metalwork is maintained by polishing. Novice boat owners who wish to do their own varnishing may be intimidated by horror stories recounted by ill-informed or malicious advisors, but with the use of quality products and modern techniques, there is no reason why the upkeep of marine varnish on a well-used vessel even in the tropic latitudes should be overly daunting. As in all artisanal practices, prep work is key. One can hardly expect aesthetically pleasing or long-lived results if proper attention is not paid to the preparation of the wood surface before the application of whichever finish is chosen. Every professional varnisher seems to have his or her own dogma concerning the actual application of the varnish, and tends to be just as dogmatic in his preferred choice of what type of varnish, and which particular brand, to use as well. If the intrepid would-be varnisher resorts to the forums of well-known yachting websites on the internet for information, he will find a bewildering variety of often conflicting advice. No two commentators seem to share exactly the same opinions, regardless of whether they are professionals or amateurs. To further confound the seeker of authoritative information, he will see the same confusing diversity of instructions at the different online how-to sites. Unfortunately, there is no real consensus to be found, online or off, about the best products or the best techniques to use in varnishing brightwork. A good rule of thumb is to consult professionals and ask where one can see examples of their work, in person. Though one professional's advice may differ from the next, if his or her work is top-notch in appearance and he has a good reputation, one may be reasonably sure of getting good advice (it is common courtesy to offer compensation for their time in consultation). Once a product choice is made, it is advisable to follow the manufacturer's instructions, usually to be found printed on the cans containing the products. It is always prudent to read accompanying pamphlets. As in any do-it-yourself project, when surveying the field of products available, \\"let the buyer beware\\". Advertising claims found in supplier catalogues or even the information within boating magazine articles should be regarded skeptically if the tone seems too enthusiastic. It is fair to say that comparative price is usually a good indicator of product quality in a reputable store. Some naifs may think it wise to buy a cheaper, in-house brand to save on cost, but this is a mistake‚Äîany such savings are negligible compared to the cost of one's time. It is not advisable to risk a chance of possibly inferior results when by far the greater cost is in the labor rather than the materials. The demanding labor of brightwork maintenance has been a storied part of maritime life for some 250 years, since before the days of William Mountaine and The Seaman's Vade-Mecum (first published 1744). As a result, it is occasionally referred to in the broader culture. For example, in the song \\"When I was a Lad\\" from the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, in which Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty, recounts that he climbed the political ladder in large part by his ability to \\"polish up the handle of the big front door\\". Lord Nelson might have cast a jaundiced eye on such an attitude, but surely those brave boat owners who persevere in completing their own brightwork varnishing project will feel that they have \\"gained the most splendid and decisive victory\\", albeit one that was perhaps \\"dearly purchased\\".

The oldest public medical school in Tennessee, the UT College of Medicine is a LCME-accredited member of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and awards graduates of the four-year program Doctor of Medicine (MD) degrees. The college's primary focus is to provide practicing health professionals for the state of Tennessee. History The University of Tennessee College of Medicine originated in 1850, but involves several institutional mergers. The first was when the Nashville Medical College, founded in 1876, was acquired by the University of Tennessee in 1879. The modern era of the college began when the Nashville Medical College was moved to Memphis in 1911 and merged with the College of Physicians and Surgeons to become the University of Tennessee College of Medicine. Following a number of mergers with the other medical science colleges, nursing, and dental departments, the then-named University of Tennessee Medical Units was renamed the University of Tennessee Health Science Center during the tenure of Dr. Edmund Pellegrino. Today, the Humphrey's General Education Building (GEB) stands on the corner of Madison Avenue and Dunlap street, where Lindsley Hall formerly housed the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The oldest surviving building (built in 1926) of the current UTHSC campus is the Wittenborg Anatomy Building, named after Dr. August H. Wittenborg. In 2012, Steve Schwab announced UTHSC aims to develop more clinical experiences for students in internal medicine, surgery, surgical sub-specialties (e.g., Anesthesiology and Radiology), family medicine, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology at UTHSC affiliate hospitals in 2013. A partnership with Saint Thomas Health subsequently expanded from one Internal Medicine Residency Program, established in 1982, to include affiliate programs in Emergency Medicine and Family Medicine. Facilities The University of Tennessee Medical Center Heart Lung Vascular Institute in Knoxville, TN The College of Medicine is affiliated with a number of teaching hospitals in Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Nashville. The University of Tennessee Health Science Center forms the backbone of the Memphis Medical District and is closely affiliated with several medical units: *Campbell Clinic in Orthopedics *Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center *Hamilton Eye Institute *Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center *Methodist University Hospital *Regional Medical Center of Memphis (The MED) *Semmes-Murphey Neurologic and Spine Institute *St. Jude Children's Research Hospital *University of Tennessee Medical Group (UTMG) The Chattanooga campus of the College of Medicine is closely affiliated with Erlanger Health System. In Knoxville, the University of Tennessee Medical Center is home to the UT Graduate School of Medicine, the largest of the nine (AAMC) Graduate Regional Medical Centers in the Southeast United States. Nashville UTHSC affiliates include Saint Thomas West, Saint Thomas Midtown and Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospitals. Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital is the home of the Internal Medicine Residency Program. An Emergency Medicine Residency Program and a Family Medicine Residency Program are both based at Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital. UT medical students spend their first two years in Memphis completing basic science coursework prior to taking the USMLE Step 1. Students then perform clinical rotations at these facilities on the Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville campuses for third and fourth year clerkships. Research The UTHSC Cancer Research Building, located on the corner of Madison Ave and S Mannassas St in Memphis, TN *The College of Medicine boasts three centers of excellence for connective tissue diseases, genomics and bioinformatics, and vascular biology. These departments collaborate significantly with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, and other research centers. *The UTHSC Level III Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL-3) is one of 13 nationally funded RBL-3 complexes that investigate infectious diseases and pathogens. Funded in 2003 by a $18 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory anchors the UT-Baptist Research Park in downtown Memphis. *The Cancer Research Building (CRB) houses research laboratories which investigate molecular bases of disease, cancer therapeutics, metastasis mechanisms, cancer genetics, viral gene therapy and other fields. Constructed in 2007, the $25.2 million CRB represents the interdisciplinary nature of cancer research conducted by College of Medicine and other UTHSC faculty. *The College of Medicine affords many medical students research opportunities through the NIH-sponsored Medical Student Research Fellowship (MSRF). This allows medical students to pursue research in the basic and clinical sciences under preceptors during the summer after their first year. *The Emergency Medicine Residency Program, Family Medicine Residency Program and Internal Medicine Residency Program at UTHSC affiliate hospitals incorporate clinical research education and training into each curriculum. The Saint Thomas Health Research Institute (STRI) supports research in the Nashville area. Research projects in individual locations place an emphasis on community collaboration that benefits local patient populations.

It runs south-west to north-east for almost , is about wide for the most part and has an area of roughly 3 km2 (761 acres). It has a general depth of around 5.2 metres (17 feet) to a maximum of around 11 metres (36 feet). The loch is fed mainly by the Maich Water, which rises in the Kilbirnie Hills near Misty Law (507m or 1663 feet), and is drained by the Dubbs Water that runs past the Barr Loch into Castle Semple Loch, followed by the Black Cart, the White Cart at Renfrew and finally the River Clyde. The boundary between East Renfrewshire and North Ayrshire, in the vicinity of the loch, runs down the course of the Maich Water along the northern loch shore to then run up beside the Dubbs Water. History=Origins and placenames Arms of Lord Sempill A view at the south end of the loch Glengarnock Castle looking over the loch from the north Hector Boece (1465‚Äì1536) is the first to publish a reference to the loch, using the name 'Garnoth', in his book of 1527 the 'Historia Gentis Scotorum' (History of the Scottish People), saying that nocht unlike the Loch Doune full of fische.Dobie, p. 314 There is a long history of drainage schemes and farming operations in the area, with co-ordinated attempts dating from about 1691 by Lord Sempill, followed by Colonel McDowal of Castle Sempil in 1774, James Adams of Burnfoot, and by others.Dobie, p. 315 Until these drainage works the two lochs nearly met and often did during flooding, to the extent that early writers such as Boece, Hollings and Petruccio Ubaldini regarded the lochs as one, using the name 'Garnoth' or 'Garnott'. The Castle Semple and Barr Lochs lie in an area previously covered until more recently by one large loch known as 'Loch Winnoch', however by the end of the 18th century silt from the River Calder had divided the loch into two. In 1814 Barr Loch and the Aird Meadow was bunded and drained, however after WW2 the area was gradually abandoned for agriculture.Scottish Natural Heritage Retrieved : 2010-10-24 'Loc Tancu' is seemingly the earliest recorded name from circa 1210 and the name 'Loch Tankard', 'Thankard' or 'Thankart' was used locally.Douglas, p. 107 A farm named 'Unthank' or 'Onthank' existed until the 19th century near to the old Nether Mill opposite the lost 'Cairn' island and together with 'Thankard' may be derived from 'Tancu'. The term 'Garnoth' has also been used and may derive from 'Garnock'. In early feudal times many Flemings were granted land in the valley of the Clyde, including an individual named 'Thankard', who gave his name to Tankerton, Wice in Wiston, Lambin in Lamington and William, the ancestor of the family of Douglas.AWAS (1880), p. 24Farewell to Feudalism Retrieved : 2010-10-13 A Lochend Farm existed in the area that is now occupied by Glengarnock. Early maps, circa 1600, show the two lochs with separate names, but effectively a continuous body of water.Blaeu Map Retrieved : 2010-12-07 The place name 'Kerse' used for the farms and the bridge at the northern end of the loch refers in Scots to 'Low and fertile land adjacent to a river or loch'.Scots Dictionary Retrieved : 2010-10-21 The old Barony of Kersland was held by the Ker (latterly Kerr) family; by chance or by association with this site the surname Kerr may derive from the nature of the location. The term 'Loch of Kilbirnie' is sometimes found in books, on older maps, etc. Ownership The Maich Water ford near East Lochridge The loch and the site of the flax rhetting pond on the western side The monks of Paisley Abbey once held the lands between the Maich and Calder and it is likely that the old toll route, using the toll point of Maich, came through this area.Old Roads of Scotland Retrieved : 2011-02-06 The loch is situated in the Parish of Kilbirnie and the ancient Barony of Glengarnock once held by the Cuninghams, a cadet branch of the Earls of Glencairn from Kilmaurs; it later formed part of the estate of the Crawfurds of Kilbirnie as a result of the Honourable Patrick Lindsay acquiring, in 1677, the Glengarnock estates and marrying Margaret, heiress of Sir John Crawfurd of Kilbirnie. Their son became the first Viscount Garnock and in 1707 he had the baronies of Kilrbirnie and Glengarnock combined under into the 'Barony of Kilbirnie'. As stated, the loch once belonged to the Cunninghames of Glengarnock, but the Craufurds of Kilbirnie disputed their rights over rowing and fishing; these families broke one another's boats, etc. until inter-marriage solved the problem. Both clans had the loch included in their charters.Loch Owners Retrieved : 2010-10-10 The boundary shown in 1654 between the baronies of Kilbirnie and Renfrew did not follow the Maich Water and Dubbs Water, it even ran into the loch itself, reflecting the aforementioned disputes.Blaeu's Map Retrieved : 2010-10-20 In 1775 Armstrong's map records 'Loch Tankard' as the property of the Earl of Crawford, but holds of the Prince of Wales.West section Armstrong's map Retrieved : 2010-10-30 In the 1860s the loch was owned by James, Earl of Glasgow.Dobie, p. 316 The solum of the loch is now owned by Scottish Enterprise, however 'riparian owners' possess the loch shoreline and have certain duties and obligations as well as rights. North Ayrshire Council own the land at the southern end of the loch, Network Rail own the land on the eastern shore of the loch along the side of the main railway line to Glasgow and private owners hold land to the west and north. The salmon fishing rights are held by the Crown. the Chivas Regal (Pernod Ricard Ltd) own the strip of land running from the railway to the loch shore opposite their whisky bond site. The Cairn Island Remains of Nether Mill that lies close to the site of the old Onthank Farm This was the only island on the loch and was thought as late as the 1860s to have been built by one of the lairds as a retreat for swans, geese, or other water fowl during the breeding season. It had a fordable causeway leading out to it and rose about 2.5 feet above the water level, clothed in trees and grasses. The southern end of the loch was the site of infill with slag and other wastes from 1841 onwards. By the 1860s 'The Cairn' had become distorted and shifted by the movement of the sediment on the loch caused by the weight of the infill, revealing the presence of a crannog lake dwelling (see 'Archaeology'). Infill operations completely destroyed then island in due course.Dobie, p. 315Kinninburgh, p. 114 An artificial island was created at the south-east end of the loch for nesting birds in the 1980s. Flax and steel The Lion Ewer found in the dugout canoe Lochside Farm was present on the north-west side of the loch in the 19th century, lying below and to the south-west of Lochrig, later Lochridge, as shown on the 19th century OS map; a 'Flax Pond' for rhetting flax, as part of the process of linen manufacture, is also shown nearby on the loch bank; it is now visible as a wet area dominated by rushes. The firm of William & James Knox, linen thread manufacturers, established as early as 1788, are still based in Kilbirnie. Scotland was amongst the first producers of flax.Strawhorn, p. 392 The road running down to the loch here from Baxter Head became known locally as the 'Shanks-McEwan Road' after the company that was contracted to remove the old steelwork's slag heaps. The Glengarnock Ironworks and the later steelworks produced slag and other wastes which were disposed of into the loch, significantly reducing its size and depth.Campbell, p. 198 The south-west section of the loch is still hazardous due to slag lying close to the surface. The Dubbs Water was originally dug as a canal in the late 18th century for transporting coal and iron ore to the steelworks and to take finished products to their markets. Roads were unsuitable for transport of heavy goods at the time and the railways were in their infancy. Loch Riggs This was a collier's hamlet near the Maich Water. The Loch Riggs Colliery was abandoned in 1808 when the works were flooded. The rich coal seams ran under the loch and were never further exploited. In 1900 the old colliery waste was encountered by the navvies during the construction of the railway between Lochwinnoch and Kilbirnie. A nearby road was locally known as the 'Back-Stair-Heid' and it has been suggested that this refers to the location of a pit ladderway used to carry coal out of the mines before winding engines were in use.Reid (2001), pp. 13‚Äì15 Geology The solid geology in the lower catchment area is carboniferous limestone. Higher ground to the North and South is mainly basalt. The drift geology includes a layer of peat to the North and boulder clay and lake alluvium over the lower catchment zone. Soils are alluvium to the North and Southeast, whilst to the East and West poorly drained non-calcareous gley soils predominate. Archaeology A reconstructed crannog on Loch Tay A Scottish dugout canoe In 1868 a crannog, its causeway and up to four logboats were revealed at the south-west corner of the loch as a result of dumping of furnace-slag from the now closed ironworks, causing the lake-bed sediments to be pushed upwards so that the crannog and logboat remains were exposed above the surface of the water. A site known as 'The Cairn' was already recognised, being exposed during exceptionally low water conditions.AWAS (1880), p. 25 The crannog and causeway are marked on the 1st edition of the OS 6-inch map (Ayrshire, sheet viii) at NS 3238 5356. Two of the boats were recorded in some detail. The most complete of the logboats was 18' (5.5m) in length, 3' (0.9m) in breadth and circa 2' (0.6m) in 'depth'; about 2' (0.6m) had been lost from the bow. The stern was 'square'. A tripod pit and a bronze ewer were found in one of the boats, now preserved at the Royal Museum of Scotland. These items were not contemporary with the logboat.Kinniburgh, p. 113 The boat itself disintegrated rapidly on exposure to air. Part of a second logboat was subsequently found 'close by the island'; its fate is not recorded. This boat was worked from 'oak'.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2010-10-10] In May 1952 part of a logboat was found on the west side of the loch and on the property of the Glengarnock Steelworks; slag-dumping operations were responsible for revealing it. Analysis of pollen from the mud found in the timber suggested that the logboat was from between about 3000 and 700bc. The surviving portion of the boat was donated to Paisley Museum.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2010-10-10] The southern end of the loch was the site of infill with slag and other wastes from 1841 onwards, the greatest loss of open water being between 1859 and 1909. By 1930 the southern end infill had largely ceased, however infill from the west bank continued for some time. Access The site of the old Beith North \\"Low\\" railway station close to the northern end of Kilbirnie Loch An 1811 map showing Kilbirny Loch (Sic) and the course of the proposed canal to Glasgow At the Kilbirnie end the loch can be accessed by following the B777 to the Lochshore Industrial Estate. This provides ample parking and the road leads to the boat launching area in the south-west corner of the loch. At the Beith end the unclassified 'Kerse' road runs between Beith and the A760 enables access to the northern shore of the loch. Parking along the roadside is difficult. At the railway bridge (NS 338 552) close to the old station is a rough track which leads down to the lochside and parking in this area is hazardous. The track and the area at the bottom are used by the local Kayak Club. Access to the land along the north shore is dependent upon the good will of the landowner at Kerse Bridge Kennels. Part of the Sustrans National Route 7 runs close to the loch, starting at Paisley Canal railway station and following the same route as National Route 75 until Johnstone, passing Elderslie and continuing south-west to Kilbarchan, Lochwinnoch and Kilbirnie, passing by Castle Semple, Barr as well as Kilbirnie Loch. Cycle paths runs on down via Glengarnock, Dalgarven and Kilwinning to Ardrossan, Irvine and beyond.Routes to Ride Retrieved : 2010-1‚Äî24Routes to Ride Retrieved : 2010-1‚Äî24 Transport The loch was used for pleasure cruises in the 18th century and coal was once carried from the Kilbirnie side across the loch to Beith. Hugh Stevenson used to have the \\"sole right to howk coal in Brodie's Glen\\" up the Maich Water. Hugh Stevenson transported the coal down to the loch, and ferried it across to a jetty which was near the mouth of the Mains Burn, then locally known as the Back Burn, and from there it was taken up to Beith by cart.Paul, Site 69 A passenger ferry also ran across the loch at one time, most likely from near the old Lochside Farm, which is reached by a lane from Stonyholm, across to the Bark Mills delta where the silt from the mains burn has encroached into the loch and a small jetty existed. The old Beith Mid Road then led up into the town itself. Natural history Bogbean in full flower The pestle puffball mushroom from Lochshore. Plantations are recorded as having existed at Willowyard near Beith from the 19th century and some woodland policies still survive; the southern end had the Lady Mary's planting, but the northern end was devoid of trees.Dobie, pp. 314‚Äì315 The old industrial sites on the western shore, for the first 0.75 km or so have substantial Willow plantations and there are some groups of older deciduous trees. Beyond the plantations, and continuing round the loch into the very north-east corner, farmland borders the loch. The Bark Mill near Mains House may be responsible for the loss of the oak trees from around the loch. The virtual absence of emergent vegetation is a characteristic of the loch and may be linked to the consolidated substrate. Castle Semple and Barr Lochs are SSSIs and Kilbirnie Loch is a Scottish Wildlife Trust designated LSNC (Local Site for Nature Conservation) in terms of the Ayrshire Local Biodiversity Action Plan (ALBAP) and in partnership with North Ayrshire Council. High levels of invasive alien waterweed species, Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis) and Nuttall‚Äôs waterweed (Elodea nuttalli) if left unchecked, will continue to spread and overwhelm other native aquatic plants. The loch's southern end is dominated by large areas of mown grass with mature grown bushes and wood copses. The western shore for the first 0.75 km or so is composed of planted willow with some older deciduous trees; round the loch into the very north-east corner, pastures surround the loch. Along the western part, the ground slopes quite steeply down to the loch. The northern shore itself is level and there are areas of marshy ground. The eastern side of the loch is a narrow strip of reedbed and bogbean grows in sheltered area. The Mains and Willowyard burns feed the loch from the eastern side and the Black Burn enters from the north-west; both have brought in silt that has created the areas of reedbeds. In addition to the Dubbs Water, a small burn, now piped, drains into the loch at the southern end. The dominant plant of the waters edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. Creeping bent, reed sweet grass and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, Canadian waterweed, slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and spiked water milfoil are the other main species present. The diatoms genera Capucina and Asterionella have been recorded, together with blue-green algae, copepods, and some rotifers. Oligochaete worms, snails, freshwater louse, leeches, mayflies, caddisfly larvae, beetles, chironomid larvae, six-spot burnet, green-veined white, common blue, common blue damselfly, are all present. Rare species Surveys have identified the following rare species: reed grass (Glyceria maxima); Carex aquatilis; viper's bugloss (Echium vulgare); mare's tail (Hippuris vulgaris); field scabious (Knautia arvensis); spiked water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum); shoreweed (Littorella uniflora); butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha); ivy-leaved crowfoot (Ranunculus hederaceus); weld (Reseda luteola); marsh yellow-cress (Rorippa islandica); bay willow (Salix pentandra); creeping yellow-cress (Rorippa sylvestris); and the relatively rare plant, bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), that grows in sheltered areas on the west bank of the loch. Activities on the loch A number of groups use the loch and its surrounds, such as the Kilbirnie Angling Club, Garnock Canoe and Boating Club, Kyle Waterski and Wakeboard Club, the Model Boat Club, Garnock Rugby Club, and the Garnock Valley Model Aircraft Club. Curling A contemporary scene from the 19th century of curling in Ayrshire Before the advent of the ironworks the loch was used for curling and in the 19th century the Paisley Saint Mirren Curling Club records show that they played in matches for Royal Caledonian Curling Club medals at Kilbirnie Loch.Paisley St. Mirren Curling Club. Retrieved : 2010-10-10 The John Bull Magazine records that on 10 January 1850 a match took place on the loch between the Eglinton Kilwinning and Beith Fullwoodhead Clubs with six rinks each and a medal given by the Royal Caledonian Club. The Eglinton team were the victors and the Earl accepted the medal from the umpire, Mr Brown of Broadstone. A large number of spectators were present.Bellman, p. 2 A Bonspiel took place at the nearby Barr Loch on 11 January 1850 and attracted huge crowds.

Birds The Dubbs Water at the Kerse Bridge Late autumn through winter are the times of greatest interest. Mallard, tufted duck, Eurasian coot and mute swan are present throughout the year, but it is towards the end of September before numbers and species begin to increase. Tufted duck, common goldeneye, Eurasian wigeon, Eurasian teal and possibly goosander with sometimes smew and greater scaup. Cormorant are frequent, with grey heron feeding along the banks, and several gull species. It has been noted that waterfowl prefer the northern reaches of the loch. The reedbed habitats are confined and not large enough for marsh specialists, although sedge warbler and reed bunting are probably present.Birding Sites Retrieved : 2010-10-10 The willow plantations, other deciduous species and scrub on the western slopes provide cover for great spotted woodpecker, tits, thrushes, finches, and warblers and other passerines. The north-eastern corner and the north shore provide shallower, marshier habitats where waders such as common snipe, common redshank, and curlew. The hawthorn and other tree cover in this area create cover and feeding for finches, tits, and thrushes, which are prey for sparrowhawks. A great grey shrike was seen here in December 2001. Historical records include storm and Leach's petrel, ruff, Atlantic puffin and black-legged kittiwake in the period 1889 to 1915.

The club is an amateur rugby union club and currently plays in the Scottish National League Division 1. The club was formed in 1972 as the result of a merger of the Old Spierians and Dalry High School FP clubs.Garnock Rugby Club ‚Äì Club History This was a response to the amalgamation of feeder schools Spier's and Dalry High (along with Kilbirnie Central and Beith Academy) to form Garnock Academy, which happened around the same time. The Old Spierians club had been founded in the early years of the 20th century and joined the Scottish Rugby Union in 1911. ;Handkea exipuliformis The Pestle puffball fungus (Handkea exipuliformis) grows at the edge of the mainly birch scrub area. This large puffball fungus releases its spores by the decay of the head portion, leaving a pestle-like stem that persists through to the following summer. Water quality The loch has had spoil, effluent and other pollutants discharged into it when the Glengarnock Iron and then Steel Works were operational; the remaining slag in the loch is relatively rich in phosphates which exacerbates the pollution problems. In the 1990s the loch become eutrophic as a result of high levels of nutrient input which has sometimes resulted in algal blooms in the summer, counteracted by bales of barley straw. These algal blooms can be dangerous to both humans and dogs. The source of this input has not been clearly tracked down, however a reedbed may be established to act as a filtration system. The loch is rather poor in terms of invertebrate faunal diversity under its present conditions, not helped by the invasive pondweeds, such as Canadian pondweed.Ayrshire Birding Retrieved : 2010-10-24 Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park Authority Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park Authority are not directly involved in the management of Kilbirnie Loch, it does however lie within the regional parks extended boundary. The park authority has in the past initiated discussions with a number of partners including Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), RSPB, etc. with 'A Shared Vision' for the 'Three Lochs'. These partners continue to develop options for the potential future management of this important wetland system. The Willowyard estate Mains Burn near the old Mains House On the east side of the loch lie the ancient lands of Willowyard, locally pronounced 'Williyard', and the various Mains dwellings associated with it. These lands were passed to Helen, daughter of Robert Lord Boyd, in her pure, spotless, and inviolate virginity and were held by her for life, the feu for the property passing to the abbot and convent of Kilwinning.AWAS (1882), p. 184 Blaeu's map of Timothy Pont's survey marks the property as 'Williezeards'. In 1559 Hugh Montgomery of Hessilhead held the lands of old extent of Williyard, in the parish of Beith and regality of Kilwinning. The lands became the property of the Hon. Francis Montgomerie of Giffin and then passed to his nephew, Alexander, 9th Earl of Eglinton. in 1723 Mr William Simson or Simpson obtained the property from the Earl.Dobie (1896), p. 173 Mr Simpson was said to be a man of expensive tastes and his son William was forced in 1772 to sell the estate to Mr John Ker of London. By 1777 Mr Ker had sold the property to Mr John Neale of Edinburgh. In 1804 John Neale sold the property to Mr Robert Steel of Port Glasgow and John and Robert Duncan are recorded as tenants.Dobie (1896), p. 172 By 1833 William Wilson (son of Janet Simson) had purchased Willowyard and his nephew, Alexander Shedden of Morishill later inherited. The surviving Willowyard House dates from 1727 in the form of 7271Dobie (1896), p. 174 is for some unrecorded reason carved on the exterior of the house. Circa 1750 a William Simson is recorded as the owner. By the end of the 18th century Willowyards was a well established farmstead and the Edinburgh Advertiser describes it as: consisting of about 175 English acres of arable land, well enclosed and subdivided into fifteen fields, and let by one lease to three substantial tenants for 19 years at ¬£130 per annum. Upon this property there is a good house, and garden stocked with fruit trees, a malt mill and an elegant court of offices newly erected. A valuable flag and stone quarry has been opened in the ground and it is believed there are both coal and limestone in it. There are about ten acres of wood and a good deal of timber on this farm; and thriving belts of planting surround the greatest part of it.British Listed Buildings Retrieved : 2011-01-16 In 1820 Willowyard is recorded as being an estate of 120 acres, well planted up by the owner with belts of plantings and the fine house situated in full view of the loch. The estate sits on whinstone and a small quarry nearby became an ornamental lake. In 1820 John Neil Esq of Edinburgh was the owner,Robertson, p. 275 however by 1822 the owner of Willowyard is recorded as being Robert Steele, a Port Glasgow ironmaster and the lands were assessed as the 14th most valuable in the parish at ¬£114 per year valued rent. The 1827 map by Aitken marks the estate as being the property of Robert Steel Esq.Aitken In the New Statistical Account, William Wilson, a maternal descendant of previous owners purchased the estate in 1832The New Statistical Account and in 1839 Alexander Shedden is noted as the owner. Willowyard House Old ornamental pond formed from an old Whinstone quarry The Willowyard Industrial Estate is situated between Kilbirnie loch and the town of Beith. A large whisky bond is located in the area with a number of large storage buildings and Willowyard House still stands, converted into offices serving a chemicals company.Love (2003), p. 84 The rubble walls of the building were harled and the window and angle margins left as exposed dressed stone; the roof was thatched originally. The main railway line from Ayr to Glasgow runs below the industrial estate and forms the eastern margin of the loch in places. Mains The properties named 'Mains' became divided up into 'Mains-Neil', 'Mains-Houston', and 'Mains-Marshal'. Robertson records that Mains-Hamilton was recently (1820) converted into a good looking house by Mr. Dun, however it passed to a Mr. Houston. A farmhouse is shown marked as Mains Hamilton on the OS map of 1856 together with an L-plan outbuilding, which may now form part of the former coachhouse at 'The Meadows' on Arran Crescent. The farmhouse was demolished and the villa built on the site, perhaps utilising the existing whinstone.British Listed Buildings Blaeu's map of Timothy Pont's survey of circa 1600 marks the properties of Mains Mure, Mainshill, and Mains neil, with Mains Mure as a castleated tower house. The 1911 OS map refers to Mains Lodge as 'Muir Lodge' after William Muir who built Mains House. The Muir family owned the Bath Lane Tannery, near the Beith Health centre of today (2011) and built the Bark Mill. William Muir of Mains joined John Muir and Sons, Tanners, Curriers, and Fancy Leather Manufacturers as a partner in 1846.Reid, p. 12 Laigh Mains, also demolished, was the home farm of Mains House. Dr McCusker, a GP based in Glasgow, owned Mains House at the time of WW2, followed by Mr Dewar, prior to its purchase and demolition which resulted from the establishment of Whisky Bonds here by Ballantyne Whisky Company in 1968, following the disaster of the Cheapside Street Whisky Bond Fire. There were engraved stones with the initials of Mr and Mrs Muir on the Mains House and these were saved when the house was demolished circa 1975 and now form part of a garden within the grounds of the bonded area. Davis records that the original single storey house of 1764 with its attic were used as a service wing to the crow stepped house had the appearance of a double version of the lodge house.Davis, p. 322 Mid Road used to cross the Bath Burn by a ford near Mains House and then ran up to the town; the road has now been abandoned and is only used by intrepid walkers. Bark Mill Ruins of the old Bark Mill William Muir of Mains House A Bark Mill, most likely built by the Muirs of Mains House, is marked on OS maps, powered by the combined Mains and Bath Burns with mill ponds indicated. The mill produced ground bark for use in the Beith tanneries using bark from the old oak trees that forested the loch side. Later the mill became a furniture factory run by Matthew Pollock who applied the use of machinery to help with the manufacture of furniture in 1858. This site was one mile from the Beith town centre. The Glasgow & South Western Railway Company constructed a siding, known as 'Muir's siding' for the convenience of transporting the finished products, etc. However the site was isolated and inconvenient for the workers and was eventually sold to Robert Balfour, who later built a new factory near Beith Town Station, the West of Scotland Cabinet Works.S1 Beith Retrieved : 2011-01-15History of the Furniture Making Industry in Beith Retrieved : 2011-01-15 The Muirs had been tanners for many generations and around 1791 John Muir and Sons, Tanners, Curriers, and Fancy Leather Manufacturers had become established at the Bath Lane works.

Mrs Kirk managed the Railway Inn at the turn of the 20th century Alexander Kirk spent his boyhood years there, attended Spier's school and served in France from 1917, graduated in medicine at Glasgow university and spent his professional life in England. A small pier existed at the north end of the loch in recent times. Much of the successful drainage works, especially of the Barr Loch, were carried out by Dutch immigrants who introduced the technology from their homeland; Dutch surnames present in the area to this day reflect this immigration. In around 1691 the Rev Patrick Warner likewise purchased and drained much of the Irving Loch or Trindlemoss, later called Scott's Loch, after returning from exile in Holland.Strawhorn, p. 60 The Ardrossan & Saltcoats Herald recorded that in 1904‚Äì05 a model yacht race under the auspices of Townhead Model Yacht Club on Kilbirnie Loch the result was: 1, John Martin, jun (Thistle); 2, James Martin (Swift); 3, John Martin (Helena); 4, William McCosh (Reliance)); 5, William Taylor (Genesta); 6, John Taylor (Bona); 7, Robert Taylor (Rover); 8, Robert Martin (Fairlie).Ardrossan & Saltcoats Herald Retrieved : 2010-10-10 A possible relic of the smuggling days of Beith is the Ley tunnel that is said to run from the site of the Grace Church on Eglinton Street to Kilbirnie Loch.Beith Online Retrieved : 2010-10-10 A geocache is located on the lochside.

The hamlet is centred on the junction of Hastingwood Road, which runs southwest to the A414 road and the Hastingwood Junction 7 of the M11 motorway, and Mill Street, which runs north to Harlow Common and Potter Street. Nearby settlements include the town of Harlow, North Weald and the hamlet of Foster Street.  History  The earliest records of Hastingwood originate from 1086 when the Paris Hall estate was founded. The remains of the estate lie on Hastingwood Road, with the mansion house dating from the 1500s still standing and given Grade II protection in 1952. It is surrounded by various ancient farms such as Canes Farm and Newhouse Farm. It was part of the Harlow Hundred and made up of this area. In 1520, Hastingwood was formerly listed as 'Hazelwood' due to its proximity to a local copse of hazel trees in the Paris Hall estate. It was renamed Hastingwood in around the 1700s. Shonks Farm: One of the old farms in Hastingwood St Clare's Hospice The village served as Oliver Cromwell's armoury during the English Civil War in 1645. Hastingwood has large flint deposits which were utilised in the production of weaponry and armour. During this period the main estate of Paris Hall was rebuilt (1600). Since 1777 the village has undergone expansion. The majority of the growth in Hastingwood centred around the common on Hastingwood Road. In this period Hastingwood Farm (currently the Rainbow and Dove) was erected as a timber framed farmhouse. There was further building development in the 19th century. Hastingwood House was erected in 1840 as a large gault brick house with farming rights. The inclosure of the common in 1861 resulted in further building development. Hastingwood established its first church in 1864 as a chapel of ease. This was part of a process of decentralising the parish, distributing the population towards the areas of Thornwood and Hastingwood. Hastingwood Farm was renamed 'The Rainbow Inn' (after the name of the owner) and became used as a stop for travellers with their horses between Cambridge and London. The further renaming of the inn to 'The Rainbow and Dove' came after travellers noticed a topiary bird, they believed was a dove, on the grounds of the inn. In the 20th century, the population expanded slightly up until the 1920s and plateaued until 1945, after-which, in the post-Second World War period, it rose. The proximity of Hastingwood to North Weald Airfield also served as a reason why housing development was required. In 1949, Hastingwood was incorporated into the North Weald Bassett parish and removed from the Harlow Hundred. Between the 1940s and 50s the 'Rainbow and Dove' was used as a dance hall but eventually this ended. The old, disused farm buildings used by 'The Rainbow and Dove' were demolished in 1954 leaving only the main farm house which is now a public house and restaurant. The M11 motorway, which runs near the west of the village, was completed in 1980. Hastingwood has seen various businesses established, St Clare's Hospice was established at the south of the village and opened by Baroness Jay of Paddington in 1990. The chapel of ease has since been converted to a dwelling.  Governance  Hastingwood is represented at Westminster by Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow. This is considered a marginal constituency but since 2010 has become increasingly Conservative. Locally it is a strongly Conservative area with the Conservatives winning 60% of the vote in 2015's local elections. Hastingwood is represented at the Essex County Council by the Conservative county councillor for North Weald and Nazeing, having won the 2017 election with 78.5% of the vote, followed by Labour with 12.7%. On the district council, Hastingwood is represented by one currently Independent councillor. Re-election for the position is in 2019. Hastingwood is one of the seats on the Epping Forest District Council to have only one councillor. The village is governed by a parish council. The parish council covers the North Weald Bassett parish and represents the settlements of North Weald, Thornwood, Hastingwood, Tyler's Green and Foster Street. Fifteen unelected councillors are part of the council. The council manages such things as local cemeteries, green space, recreational grounds, and allotments.  Geography  The highest parts of the parish are in the south and west, rising to .

Xu Youchun (main ed.), p. 939, his birth year was 1897. ‚Äì November 27, 1952) was a politician in the Republic of China. He was an important figure during the Reorganized National Government of China. His courtesy name was Zhihou ('). Biography Zhou was born in Anxin, Zhili (Now Hebei). He graduated from Peking University and Guangdong University. In 1925, he became an instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy. Zhou Xuechang successively held the positions of Political Chief of the 2nd Division in the East Route Army of the Northern Expedition, Chairman of the Kuomintang's Central Committee and Leading Member of the Beiping (Peking) Branch of the Kuomintang, etc. In 1931, he was appointed to the Chief of the Bureau for Education of the Beiping City Government. In next October, he was appointed to the Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Government. In 1938, he became Member of the Preparatory committee for Xikang Province. From August 1939, Zhou Xuechang joined Wang Jingwei in creating the collaborationist Reorganized National Government of China, and was appointed Member of the Kuomintang's Central Committee (Wang clique). In next September, he was appointed Superintendent of Education of the Training Team for Central Political Affairs. In December 1941,Xu, op.cit. According to Liu Shoulin (etc.ed.), p.1134, Zhou was appointed to this position in January 1942. he was promoted to Mayor of the Nanjing Special City, and stayed on this position until the Wang Jingwei regime collapsed. After the Reorganized National Government of China collapsed, on August 17, 1945, the former Director of the Taxation Police Bureau () Zhou Gao () who was a subordinate of Zhou Fohai suddenly started arresting important members of the former government. However, the Vice-Chief of Staff of the China Expeditionary Army , Takeo Imai () urged that Zhou Gao to release his captives, so Zhou Xuechang was also set free.Liu Jie, pp.156-157. It was widely believed that Zhou Fohai wanted to make an appeal his loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek, so he ordered Zhou Gao to arrest important people of the Wang Jinwei Regime. But Zhou Fohai denied his responsibility. On September 26 the same year, Zhou Xuechang was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's National Government. On October 19, 1945 he was convicted of treason and surrender to the enemy and was sentenced to death. In May 1947, his sentence was confirmed by the higher court. However, the Chinese Civil War occurred before his sentence could be carried out, and in January 1949, he was transferred to the Tilanqiao Prison in Shanghai. After the People's Republic of China had been established, his treatment did not change, and he remained imprisoned to his death of illness on November 27, 1952.According to Yu Zidao (etc.), p.1615.

It consists of a vertically-arranged cylindrical column filled with liquid, at the bottom of which gas is inserted.  Principle  The introduction of gas takes place at the bottom of the column and causes a turbulent stream to enable an optimum gas exchange. Numerous forms of construction exist. The mixing is done by the gas sparging and it requires less energy than mechanical stirring. The liquid can be in parallel flow or counter-current. Bubble column reactors are characterized by a high liquid content and a moderate phase boundary surface. The bubble column is particularly useful in reactions where the gas-liquid reaction is slow in relation to the absorption rate. This is the case for gas-liquid reactions with a Hatta number Ha <0.3. Bubble column reactors are used in various types of chemical reactions like wet oxidation, or as algae bioreactor. Since the computerized design of bubble columns is restricted to a few partial processes, experience in the choice of a particular type column still plays an important role.  Literature  Bubble column reactors belong to the general class of multiphase reactors which consist of three main categories namely, the trickle bed reactor (fixed or packed bed), fluidized bed reactor, and the bubble column reactor. Bubble columns are the devices in which gas, in the form of bubbles, come in contact with the liquid. The purpose may be simply to mix the two phases or substances are transferred from one phase to another i.e. when the gaseous reactants are dissolved in liquid or when liquid reactant products are stripped. The bubble column in which the gas is fed into the column at the bottom and rises in the liquid escaping from it at the upper surface; the gas is consumed to a greater or lesser extent depending on the intensity of mass transfer and chemical reaction. BCRs are becoming more competitive due to their inherent advantages and are used in numerous industrial applications. The advantages are; better temperature control; lower pressure drop; and excellent heat transfer rates per unit volume of the reactor. Additional advantages include; higher values of effective interfacial areas; little maintenance required due to simple construction; and relatively cheap to construct and operate and require less floor space. The hydrodynamics of any SBCR have a significant effect on its scale up analysis. In SBCRs, gas phase that is moving upward transfers momentum to the slurry phase that is either stagnant or moving slower than the gas. Therefore, the hydrodynamics of SBCRs are controlled mainly by the gas flow. It has been reported that the operating conditions and design as well as the geometry of the column strongly affect the hydrodynamics of the SBCRs.

He also won a gold medal at the 1959 Pan American Games for Team USA after the squad finished with a 6‚Äì0 record. It was the first Pan American Games to be played in the United States as well. Early life Byrd was born and raised in Huntington, West Virginia and was the son of a Methodist minister. At age 12, he was stricken with infantile paralysis (polio), but he eventually recovered to a full, normal life. Byrd attended Huntington High School and became a prolific scorer. During his senior year of 1954‚Äì55, he averaged a state-record 34.2 points per game (ppg) for a season total of 889 points. He led the school to a 22‚Äì4 record en route to the Class A state championship game and shattered the three-game tournament's previous scoring record of 93 points ‚Äì Byrd scored 128 points with games of 48, 49 and 31 points, respectively. Over that season he scored 40 or more points six times, including a career-high 56 against Bluefield, one of the larger schools. Despite his scoring ability, his high school coach lauded his \\"team\\" concept of basketball. College Byrd enrolled at Marshall College (now called Marshall University) in 1955. Due to NCAA rules that freshmen were not allowed to play on varsity sports, he was forced to participate on the school's freshmen men's basketball team for the 1955‚Äì56 season. A guard, Byrd had to wait until the following season to play for the varsity team. As a sophomore in 1956‚Äì57, he played in all 24 games and averaged 16.4 ppg. The next season, Byrd once again played in 24 games but this time his scoring jumped up to 24.9 ppg. He led the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in scoring for the first time and compiled 599 points on the year. Playing in the era before the three-point shot, Byrd made 214 field goals and 171 free throws. He also holds the distinction as being the first player from Marshall to lead the MAC in scoring. In 1958‚Äì59, Byrd's senior season, he led the MAC in scoring for a second consecutive time; his 29.3 ppg average en route to 704 total points were tops in the league. Once again, Byrd played in 24 games for a third straight season, bringing his career totals to 72 games played and 1,705 points scored. At the end of the season, Byrd was named a consensus Second Team All-American. Post-college career Leo Byrd was selected as the 25th overall pick in the 1959 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals. He never ended up playing professionally, however. Instead, Byrd was named as one of 14 players to represent the United States at the 1959 Pan American Games. This team also contained future Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. The 1959 Pan American Games‚Äîonly the third PanAm Games ever‚Äîwere played in Chicago. The United States had won the gold medal at both previous Games, and Byrd was on the squad that won its third gold after finishing the tournament 6‚Äì0. Byrd played in four of the six contests and scored 10 points (2.5 ppg). He shot 4-for-9 from the field and 2-for-4 from the free throw line.

His notable sculptures include busts of Victor Cousin, Odilon Barrot, Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger, Alphonse de Lamartine, Gioachino Rossini, and Marie Antoinette.Berlioz, p139; Waters, p4. Photography After becoming established as a sculptor, Adam-Salomon studied photography under the portraitist Franz Hanfstaengl in Munich in 1858. He became a leading portrait photographer. Adam-Salomon returned to Paris where he opened a portrait studio in 1859; in 1865 he opened a second Paris studio.Union List of Artists' Names In 1870 Adam-Salomon was made a member of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie and received the L√©gion d'honneur the same year.Turner, Grove Dictionary of Art. Adam-Salomon's portrait photographs were considered to be among the best existing works during his lifetime, and were renowned for their chiaroscuro produced by special lighting techniques.Hannavy, p. 6. Acceptance of photography as art The photography of Adam-Salomon played a pivotal role in the mainstream acceptance of photography as an art form. For example, in 1858 the poet Alphonse de Lamartine described photography as \\"this chance invention which will never be art, but only a plagiarism of nature through a lens.\\" A short time later, after seeing the photographs by Adam-Solomon, Lamartine changed his opinion.Jay, p. 138. Critical praise Coverage of Salomon's work in the French press outnumbered that of F√©lix Nadar by a ratio of ten to one. After the Paris Exposition of 1867, the reviewer for The Times (UK) described Salomon's pictures \\"matchless\\", \\"beyond praise,\\" \\"the finest photographic portraits in the world.\\"Buerger, p. 56.

It is one of the main events of the Greek revolts that erupted in Thessaly and Epirus during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. Background The creation of the independent Greek state spread irredentism to other, Ottoman areas with Greek inhabitants such as Thessaly, Epirus and Macedonia.Douglas Dakin \\"The unification of Greece, 1770-1923\\", pg.129 In Western Thessaly, agitations had started without the official involvement of the Hellenic Army, but a committee of Greek Officers had been secretly sent so as to coordinate with local guerrilla bands the harassment of Ottoman troops.William Kinnaird Rose: \\"With the Greeks in Thessaly\\" Elibron Classics. 2005 - Adamant Media Corporation, pg.50 The headquarters was installed in Loutro Karditsas, under the overall command of Artillery Colonel Konstantinos Ischonomachos, aided by Captains Georgios Filaretos and Ioannis Igglesis. Events Guerrilla warfare was already endemic in the area against Turks and Albanians. By the beginning of March 1878, the local chieftain Thanassis Ziakas and his band of Agraphiote brigands had revolted in the villages of Vounista, Granista and Mesenikola. Stylianos Tzavaras, a senior sergeant in the Greek Army, also formed a compact force with Sarakatsan and Vlach klephts, many of them members of the infamous Arvanitakis gang.Romilly Jenkins ‚ÄúThe Dilessi Murders ‚Äì Greek Brigands and English Hostages\\", Prion Books 1981, pp. 34-36 Both groups gathered together and directed an attack on the village of Mouzaki, which was a strategic point in the region, key to obtaining food and water. In addition, it was the opportunity to draw Ottoman troops from the large cities into the countryside. Battle The news about these events, and the fact that there was a considerable population of Turkish landlords and Muslim Albanians in danger soon reached Trikala, where the authorities sent a detachment of troops under Moussa Gkeka so as to recover the village and suppress the rebellion. For the Greeks, it was a vital opportunity to defeat a major enemy, therefore troops from the regular Greek Army were deployed in order to support the irregulars. The Ottoman troops seemed not to expect to face any other forces than a gang of klephts as they have been used to do for years, so their strength was reduced to light cavalry and infantry troops. As a result, the Ottomans were taken by surprise and completely defeated by much stronger and better-equipped Greek troops under Lieutenants Georgios Alexandris and Takis Stournaris on 4 May 1878. The Turks suffered heavy losses, and Gkeka himself was taken prisoner. Aftermath The minor victory at Mouzaki was a morale boost for the rebels, but it did not change reality on the ground: the Ottomans soon stamped out the rebellion, while Greece was pressured by the Great Powers to remove support of the rebels. In the end however, Thessaly would be incorporated into the Greek kingdom in 1881.Ellis Ashmead Bartlett: \\"The Battlefields of Thessaly: with Personal Experiences in Turkey and Greece\\" Elibron Classics. 2005 - Adamant Media Corporation References Category:1878 in Greece Mouzaki Mouzaki Category:Ottoman Thessaly Mouzaki Category:1878 in the Ottoman Empire Category:May 1878 events ","title":"Battle of Mouzaki"},{"id":"29142896","text":"Piegan Glacier is in Glacier National Park in the U.S. state of Montana.

Retrieved 13 October 2010. History Leah's Yard was constructed in the early part of the 19th century as a works for the manufacture of shears and other hand tools. As was typical with small works of this type. Leah's Yard had many different trade occupants and as such the building underwent many alterations and additions which are evident today. Throughout the 19th century the yard was used by a horn dealer (who supplied the cutlery handle making trade), Sheffield platers, knife manufacturers and silver stampers. In the 1880s the building was known as the Cambridge Street Horn Works. In 1892 Henry Leah took over the building as a producer of die stamps for silverware, giving the building the name that it is known by today. Sharing the building at that time was Walter Walker & Co Ltd, who were piercers and stampers; the building was alternatively known as the Cambridge Stamping Works.\\"One Great Workshop: The Buildings of the Sheffield Metal Trade\\", English Heritage, , Page 38. At the end of the 19th century steam power was introduced to run a grinding hull and drop hammers in a silver die stamping shop. The key to the success of buildings such as Leah's Yard was that they could be adapted to provide accommodation for a number of different metal industry trades on the same site. They provided adaptable, cheap work space by crowding buildings into a confined area. By 1905, the workshops around the courtyard of Leah's Yard were occupied by eighteen little mesters whose trades included dram flask manufacturer, hollow ware and silver buffers, palette knife makers, steel fork manufacturer, silver ferrule maker, brass and nickel silver turners, electroplate producer and a cutler.\\"Pevsner Architectural Guides - Sheffield\\", Ruth Harman & John Minnis, , Pages 99 & 100.

There are external wooden staircases to give access to the upper floors and large casement windows to give plenty of natural light for the workmen. Present day Today Leah's Yard stands in a derelict state, it has not been used for over 20 years when the lower floor was used as a shop. The building is located between two public houses on Cambridge Street, The Benjamin Huntsman and The Tap and Tankard.

Aldo Conterno (1931 ‚Äì May 30, 2012) was an Italian winemaker of eponymous wine producer Poderi Aldo Conterno from the Piemonte region in the district of Langhe, chiefly producing Barolo wines. The winery is located in Monforte d'Alba, and Conterno was widely ranked among Piemonte's foremost producers. History Aldo Conterno was born in 1931, the second son of Giacomo Conterno. In 1954, Aldo left Italy and joined two uncles who lived in San Francisco with a view to start a winery in Napa Valley. However, soon after his arrival to the United States he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served for two years in Korea, leaving with an honorable discharge and the rank of Specialist. Conterno returned to Italy after having spent near five years away. Conterno and his older brother Giovanni assumed responsibility of the Giacomo Conterno estate in 1961, but the brothers eventually parted ways over conflicting philosophies on the production of Barolo wine, and in 1969 Aldo Conterno established Poderi Aldo Conterno.Asimov, Eric, The New York Times (April 5, 2010 ). A Rare Tasting of Conterno Barolos While Aldo Conterno had been inspired by the modernist innovations of Angelo Gaja of Barbaresco, and differs in style and method from the strict traditional methods of his brother Giovanni, Aldo Conterno wines are still considered largely traditional, but for a few exceptions.Kissack, Chris, thewinedoctor.com Aldo ConternoJ.

Italian Wine Legend Aldo Conterno Passes Away Winemaking practices and style Among Barolo aficionados the wines of Aldo Conterno have earned a reputation for being \\"modernist\\" but with a blend of traditional Barolo winemaking practices. Like many traditional Barolo makers, Conterno favored long aging of his wines prior to their release to the public. For his Riserva Gran Bussia, the wine would typically be aged 3 years in large Slavonian oak casks followed by two years in stainless steel and another year in bottle prior to release. Unlike many modernist Barolo winemakers, Conterno did not use many small oak barriques however he did adapt to the modernist method of shortening the maceration time during fermentation and pressing the skins earlier than many traditional Barolo producers. These mixture of practices tended to create wines that are often described in wine literature as \\"powerfully structured\\" like many traditional producers but with a \\"depth of fruit\\" that is often described of modernist Barolo wines. Explaining why he insisted on the use of large, used botti and never apply French new barriques for oak influence, Conterno stated, \\"Vanilla, toast, spice and sweet tannins don‚Äôt belong in Barolo\\". Though committed to the focus on production of Barolo, Conterno remained among the Piemonte producers who were devoted to produce quality Barbera.Kramer, Matt, Wine Spectator (May 18, 2010). Belief in Barbera Production Poderi Aldo Conterno owns around of vineyard land in Bussia Soprana, about 400 meters above sea level.

History From unclear descriptions of its origin, the Cantine Giacomo Conterno production of Barolo may have begun in 1908 with the founding of Giovanni Conterno's tavern in San Giuseppe near Monforte d'Alba, or after his son Giacomo Conterno returned from service in World War I, with the first Barolo riserva either bottled in 1912 or 1920.polanerselections.com Giacomo Conterno Notwithstanding, Conterno coming from a family with viticultural roots in the region going back to the 18th century, is considered one of the first small Barolo producers to bottle an own wine, beginning in the 1920s during a time when Barolo was normally sold in cask or demijohn and intended for early drinking. Giovanni Conterno died in 1934 and Giacomo Conterno created a Barolo with vast aging potential, named Monfortino for the home village Monforte d‚ÄôAlba. For 54 years two Barolos, a normale and riserva, were produced from purchased grapes, made by the motto that a Barolo at the time of bottling should be \\"undrinkable\\", though be a great bottle after twenty, thirty, forty years. Giacomo Conterno's sons, Giovanni and Aldo Conterno, formally took over the estate in 1961. With the older Giovanni Conterno already responsible for winemaking since the 1959 vintage, Aldo Conterno eventually parted over conflicting winemaking philosophies with his brother, and founded his own estate Poderi Aldo Conterno in 1969. While Giacomo Conterno wines represent the strictly traditional Barolo winemaking philosophy, Aldo Conterno too shares the view that the \\"modernist\\" approach of using small barriques in combination with shorter maceration times undermines the character of Barolo and add a vanillin sweetness to the wine that overrides the inherent fruit of the nebbiolo.Maresca, Tom, The Wine News (October/November 2002). Spotlight on Barolo In 1974 Giovanni Conterno purchased the Cascina Francia vineyard in Serralunga, bringing an end to the era of purchasing fruit from local farmers. The first vintage of wine made from own vineyard was 1978, though the name Cascina Francia did not appear on the label of the normale until the 1980 vintage. Giovanni Conterno's youngest son Roberto began to work by his father's side in 1988, and after Giovanni Conterno died at 75 in February 2004,McCathy, Ed, Wine Review Online (February 21, 2006). Five Stars in Piedmont Roberto Conterno continued the family industry in the strict traditionalist fashion. In 2008 Roberto Conterno purchased a vineyard in Serralunga‚Äôs Cerretta, from which wine was produced beginning with the 2008 vintage. In 2015 Roberto bought from Cantina Gigi Rosso the prized nine-hectare Arione vineyard, next to Cascina Francia. The new vineyard includes just over 3.5 ha Nebbiolo da Barolo, just over 1ha Nebbiolo d‚ÄôAlba and just over 1ha Barbera d‚ÄôAlba. Production While the Barolo riserva Monfortino is only produced in exceptional years, the Barolo Cascina Francia is not made every year either, exemplified by the difficult 2002 vintage of rain and hail, which allowed only for a small amount of grapes acceptable to make Monfortino, but not Cascina Francia, the first time that a riserva was produced but no normale.Asimov, Eric, The New York Times: The Pour (April 6, 2010). Comparing Conterno Barolos: Cascina Francias and Monfortinos The Nebbiolo and Barbera grapes come from the vineyard Cascina Francia in Serralunga d'Alba, entirely owned by the Giacomo Conterno estate. From the 2009 vintage wines are forthcoming from the newly acquired Cerretta vineyard holding with 2 ha of Nebbiolo and 1 ha of Barbera, with the Nebbiolo classified as Langhe Nebbiolo.

Born in Glasgow, he began his career with local youth sides before appearing as a guest player for Plymouth Argyle and Celtic during the Second World War while serving in the Royal Navy. After the war, he joined Celtic permanently where he remained for two seasons. He joined Belfast Celtic in 1948. He played in the club's final season before it resigned from the Irish League following an incident when its players were attacked by supporters of a rival team. After touring the United States in Belfast Celtic's last matches, he moved to Football League side Bury where he made over 100 appearances for the club in a three-year spell. He spent one season with Cardiff City prior to joining Millwall in 1953. He made more than 130 league appearances for Millwall before moving into non-league football. Early life Hazlett was born in Pollokshaws in the south of Glasgow. He was raised in the city with his four siblings. His father worked as a miner. Career=Scotland and Ireland Hazlett played for St. Mary's Boys Club and Blantyre Celtic as a teenager. Hazlett's career was postponed during the Second World War when he joined the Royal Navy, serving as a shipwright petty officer. During his service, he guested for Plymouth Argyle while stationed in the south of England. The club were competing in the wartime Football League South and he made his debut in September 1945. In November 1945, Celtic made a request to the Royal Navy for Hazlett to be excused from duty in order to play for the club in a Wartime fixture against Motherwell in place of Jimmy Delaney who was away on international duty. Flying in from Scapa Flow, he made his debut for the club in a 3‚Äì0 victory. After the end of the war, Plymouth had hoped for Hazlett to remain but released him in order for the player to return to Scotland and join Celtic in February 1946. He made his professional debut in an Old Firm Derby match against local rivals Rangers, scoring his side's goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw. However, he struggled with a persistent knee injury that restricted his appearances for the club. Belfast Celtic captain Harry Walker met Hazlett during a scouting trip to Scotland and recommended he visit Joe Devlin, Belfast Celtic's physiotherapist. Devlin helped Hazlett overcome the injury and the close relationship persuaded Hazlett to join Belfast Celtic in 1948. He described the transfer as \\"the best move I ever made\\", adding \\"I got good wages, a job and settled down quickly. Belfast was so like Glasgow.\\" As well as being provided a day job by the club, he received wages of between ¬£10‚Äì12 a week. In his first season with Belfast Celtic, Hazlett played in a derby match against Linfield that ended in violence after Celtic scored a late equaliser in a match that saw two men sent off and two Linfield players taken off injured. At the end of the match, Celtic forward Jimmy Jones was attacked by opposition supporters, being pushed over a pitch side wall before being kicked so badly he suffered a broken leg. His teammates rushed to help him, with Hazlett receiving a punch to the face during the melee. The club folded at the end of the season with Hazlett featuring in its last ever league match, a 4‚Äì3 victory over Cliftonville on 21 April 1949. He was also part of the side that toured the United States in 1949, scoring in a 4‚Äì2 victory over Detroit Select at the University of Detroit Stadium, although he missed the side's 2‚Äì0 victory over the touring Scotland national team through injury. However, Hazlett's experience of Scottish football proved invaluable in assisting manager Elisha Scott to plan for the fixture. The tour was the last set of matches the club played before folding having resigned from the Irish League. Football League Hazlett joined Football League side Bury in June 1949 for a fee of ¬£2,500. He made more than 100 appearances during a year spell with the club. In 1952, he played in a trial match for First Division side Cardiff City and impressed manager Cyril Spiers enough for him to complete a ¬£5,000 transfer soon after. He made his debut for Cardiff in the second match of the 1952‚Äì53 season against Middlesbrough and scored in his home debut during his next appearance in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday. Despite playing in 6 of the club's first 8 matches, he was dropped in favour of Mike Tiddy and made only one further league appearance. At the end of the season, he was released by the club having made seven league appearances. He subsequently signed for Millwall where he played for five seasons, making over 100 appearances, before moving into non-league football with Guildford City. Later life Hazlett met his wife Shirley while playing for Bury. The couple had two children, Lynne and John. After retiring from football, Hazlett lived in New Cross Road near his former club Millwall where he worked as a PE teacher and later as an education welfare officer for the Inner London Education Authority. He also became a qualified football coach after gaining his coaching badges from the Football Association and worked with local youth and senior teams into his 70s. In his later years, Hazlett discovered that he had been living with one of his kidneys functioning at only 15 per cent. He and his wife retired to Farnborough in Kent. He died on 22 December 2012 at the age of 89.

The film is a melodramatic murder mystery set in the Victorian era and was adapted from a stage play by William Dinner and William Morum. It was made at Isleworth Studios. The sets were designed by the art director George Provis while the costumes were by Elizabeth Haffenden. Plot The domineering Edwina Black has just died, and the general feeling appears to be of relief. The local community whispers that her death is a blessing for all concerned, particularly her henpecked widower Gregory (Farrar) and downtrodden personal companion Elizabeth (Fitzgerald). Unknown to anybody, Gregory and Elizabeth have been lovers for some time, and matters take a serious turn when the local doctor, feeling uneasy about Edwina's sudden and unexpected death, orders a post-mortem. It reveals that Edwina's body is full of arsenic. Inspector Martin (Culver) has been instructed to get to the bottom of the case and his suspicions naturally fall on Gregory and Elizabeth, who have motive and opportunity. In the absence of proof, he sets out to trap them, hoping that they will inadvertently implicate themselves. A guidebook to Italy is found in Elizabeth's possession. How does she explain that? A complicating factor arises when it is discovered that the housekeeper Ellen (Jean Cadell) has been keeping secrets of her own, and also had good reason for wishing Edwina ill. Martin proceeds to drop seemingly innocuous but loaded observations into the ears of the three suspects, hoping to provoke doubts and foster mutual suspicion. This works so well that they are soon apparently falling over themselves to incriminate each other. Martin has to try to untangle the stories to come up with a coherent picture of what actually happened, all the while being aware that he is perhaps being misdirected.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian, patron saints of physicians and surgeons. History The church originates from the 12th century, it was extended in the 13th century, and partly rebuilt during the following century. The roof was constructed in about 1540. The church underwent a Victorian restoration in 1875 and further restoration in 1922. The church was declared redundant on 1 December 1972, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 25 January 1974. Architecture=Exterior The church is almost as wide as it is long. It is constructed in coursed rubble stone with ashlar dressings, and it has a machine-tile roof. Its plan consists of two naves and two chancels in parallel under a single roof, and a south porch. At the west end is a shingled bellcote with a small broach spire. In the north wall are a large lancet window, a small window with a semicircular head, and a blocked door with a semicircular head. The west window of the north nave has a two-light window with another circular window above it. The east window also has two lights. On the south side of the church are two lancet windows and a timber porch. At the entrance to the porch is an arch-braced tie-beam.

They were signed with Decca Records and released a self-titled album in 1968 with songs by Jerry Keller and David Blume. Their musical style consisted of pop harmonies influenced by the soft rock and folk rock styles that were popular during the late 1960s. Jay Hopkins died on September 6, 2001. The duo's songs have featured on multiple sunshine pop compilations. A digitally remastered and expanded edition of the 1968 Twinn Connexion album was reissued by the Now Sounds record label on May 18, 2010.  Biography = Early years  Born on January 15, 1941, identical twin brothers Jerry and Jay Hopkins grew up in Helena, Montana. They began singing together in grade school and performed in several plays at the Old Brewery Theatre, a summer stock playhouse in Helena. They reprised their roles from the play The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker in a national television commercial as the Imperial Margarine twins. While in high school, the brothers starred in a local half- hour weekly television show, \\"Teen Time Varieties\\". In January 1963, after attending the University of Montana, the twins moved to New York City. They appeared in Off-Broadway theatre productions, worked in costume and set design, and maintained day jobs. They secured regular singing gigs at coffeehouses and clubs in Greenwich Village, where they were discovered by Decca Records executive Bill Downer.  Recording history  After signing with Decca Records, Twinn Connexion began work on an album with producer Jerry Keller, his frequent collaborator Dave Blume, and session musicians from the Carolyn Hester Coalition. The duo's first single with Decca, \\"Sixth Avenue Stroll\\", was released in July 1968. Record World called it a \\"bright song\\" and remarked that the brothers \\"should make a connexion with kids\\". Twinn Connexion's self-titled debut album was released in October. The cover features the brothers standing next to each other wearing identical yellow and white Nehru suits with green ascots and pins with \\"2x\\" written on them. In the July 20, 1968 issue of Billboard magazine, \\"Oh What Lovely Day\\" was recognized in the \\"Special Merit Spotlight\\" column, where the publication reports designated singles \\"deserving [of] special attention\\". The critic wrote that the song's happy beat and duo's sound \\"could easily hit with much play and sales impact.\\" Twinn Connexion's final Decca single was \\"I Think I Know Him\\", released late in 1968. A Cash Box review complimented the song's instrumentation and vocal delivery. The B-side is a cover version of The Cyrkle's \\"Turn-Down Day\\", a 1966 single that was also written by Keller and Blume.  Later careers  Decca was acquired by Westinghouse Electric and promotion for Twinn Connexion dwindled, so Jerry Hopkins went back to school, earned an art degree and lives in Woodstock, New York. Jay Hopkins became a metals trader on Wall Street, where he worked until he died of heart failure in September 2001. Twinn Connexion songs have appeared on compilation albums such as Morning Glory Daze: Universal Soft Rock Collection, Vol. 2 (1997) and Get Easy! Sunshine Pop Collection (2003). The duo's self-titled debut album was reissued in 2010 by Now Sounds, an imprint of Cherry Red Records. Later in 2010, an album titled Songs from the Heart, featuring remastered versions of previously unreleased Twinn Connexion songs, was released in Korea and Japan by Big Pink Music. Twinn Connexion (1968) The album was released by Decca Records on October 4, 1968, with songs by Jerry Keller and David Blume. The musical style consisted of pop harmonies influenced by the soft rock and folk rock styles that were popular during the late 1960s. Interest in the duo's music was revived when their musical style was recognized as belonging to the subgenre of 1960s pop music now called sunshine pop. Their songs were featured on several popular sunshine pop compilations. There was soon a demand for the 1968 Twinn Connexion album, with the rare copies fetching high prices on the collectors' market. A digitally remastered and expanded edition of the 1968 Twinn Connexion album was reissued by the Now Sounds record label on May 18, 2010. The remastered album includes eight bonus tracks. The CD comes with a 24-page booklet that features with photos and exclusive commentary from the surviving member of the duo, Jerry Hopkins.

She is now owned by Oceania Cruises as part of its Regatta Class of ships, but recently sailed for Hapag-Lloyd as the Columbus 2. She was built in 1998 by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire, France for Renaissance Cruises as MS R One. On 11 December 2014, 3 crew members died in a fire that broke out in the engine room when the ship was docked in St. Lucia. Concept and construction Renaissance Cruises had begun operations in 1989, with a series of eight small luxury cruise ships constructed during the course of the next three years. In the mid-90s the company placed an order for eight identical vessels with Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in France. The first ship in the series, , was delivered in June 1998, followed by R Two in November of the same year. MS Insignia is scheduled to undergo a significant renovation as a part of the company's $100 million OceaniaNEXT program. The refurbished cruise ship will debut in December 2018. Lease to Hapag-Lloyd MS Columbus 2 in Pula, Croatia, May 2012. Beginning in April 2012, MS Insignia began what was initially announced as a two-year lease to Hapag-Lloyd, which renamed the ship Columbus 2. Hapag- Lloyd decided that after 2014 they would not renew the charter of the Columbus 2, in favor of focusing their luxury product. Insignia rejoined the Oceania fleet in 31 May 2014. Engine Fire On 11 December 2014 whilst alongside in Castries, St. Lucia, MS Insignia experienced a major fire in her engine room. Two contract workers and one crew member, working in the engine room at the time, lost their lives. The resulting damages made it necessary to end the voyage started just 4 days prior in Miami. All passengers were disembarked and flown to their home towns. After minor repairs to restore power, MS Insignia was towed to San Juan, Puerto Rico where she was fully repaired. The ship was back in service by 22 March 2015 to start a world cruise from Singapore. The delayed departure date for the cruise resulted in a heavily modified itinerary, although many of the principal cruise destinations were still visited.

After reaching the highest military ranks, a palace conspiracy forced him to seek refuge in the Abbasid court in 829. He returned to Byzantine service the next year, receiving the position of Domestic of the Schools from Emperor Theophilos, who had married his niece Theodora. Manuel remained in the post throughout Theophilos's reign, and reportedly saved the emperor's life in the Battle of Anzen in 838. According to one report, he died on 27 July 838 of wounds received during the battle, but other sources record his survival past this date, ascribing him a major role in the regency that governed the empire after Theophilos's death, and report that he died some time around 860. Biography Manuel was of Armenian origin, and the brother of Marinos, the father of the future Byzantine empress Theodora. Manuel first appears in the reign of Michael I Rangabe (ruled 811‚Äì813), when he held the post of protostrator (head of the imperial stables). At the time, he must still have been young, probably in his twenties. Although he urged Michael to confront Leo the Armenian, following Michael's deposition by Leo (r. 813‚Äì820), Manuel was promoted to the rank of patrikios and entrusted with the post of strategos of the Armeniac or the Anatolic Theme. The latter post was the most senior of the Byzantine Empire's thematic governors, and Leo himself had held the office prior to his accession. According to historians John B. Bury and Warren Treadgold, in early 819 and for about a year, Leo seems to have appointed Manuel to the exceptional post of monostrategos (\\"single-general\\") of the five land themes of Asia Minor, but this unusual concentration of command authority was apparently directed towards the more effective suppression of iconophile resistance against Leo's reinstatement of Iconoclasm rather than for military purposes. This appointment is, however, most likely a misreading of the primary source, according to the editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit. According to the history of Michael the Syrian, at about the same time Manuel was responsible for the negotiations with the Khurramite refugees and their leader, Nasr, who became baptized as Theophobos in Byzantine service; however, Michael's chronology of this episode is confused and of doubtful accuracy. Manuel's career under Leo's successor, Michael II the Amorian (r. 820‚Äì829), is unclear, as he is not mentioned in the sources during this period. Certainly at the time of the outbreak of the great rebellion of Thomas the Slav, the strategos of the Armeniacs was Olbianos, while the Anatolics joined the rebellion. Manuel himself, however, evidently remained loyal to Michael, and it was probably the latter who raised him to the rank of magistros. The editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit suggest that Manuel may have been recalled by Michael to Constantinople, especially if the marriage of Michael's son and heir Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842) and Manuel's niece Theodora took place around 821, as suggested by E.W. Brooks, and not around 830, as suggested by Treadgold. Escape to the Caliphate John the Grammarian in 829 to Ma'mun (depicted left) from Theophilos (depicted right), as depicted in the Madrid Skylitzes. In 829, either some time before (according to Theophanes Continuatus, followed by E.W. Brooks and the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit and others) or shortly after (according to Symeon Logothetes, accepted by Treadgold, the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and others) the death of Michael and the accession of Theophilos, Manuel defected to the Abbasids as a result of machinations at court: the logothetes tou dromou (foreign minister) Myron had accused him to the new emperor of plotting to seize the throne.. Using the carriages of the imperial post, he crossed Asia Minor in haste and offered his services to Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833), on condition that he would not be forced to convert to Islam. According to the 13th-century historian Vardan Areveltsi, so great was Ma'mun's joy at this defection that he gave Manuel a daily salary of 1,306 silver dirhams, and continually presented him with gifts. Theophilos, in turn, was hesitant to believe the accusations, and was eventually convinced by the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence. He therefore resolved to get Manuel to return, and sent John the Grammarian to Baghdad on a diplomatic mission in the winter of 829/830, ostensibly in order to announce his accession. John was indeed able to see Manuel in private and offered him the Emperor's pardon, which Manuel seemed to accept, although for the time being, Manuel remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance. In the summer of 830, Manuel participated in an Abbasid expedition against the Khurramite rebels of Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan, alongside a contingent of Byzantine captives. The campaign was nominally led by Ma'mun's own son, al-'Abbas, but it is likely, according to Treadgold, that the more experienced Manuel was the actual commander, as Arabic and Syriac sources record that he commanded an \\"army of Arabs and Persians\\". After winning a few modest successes, the army turned back south. Manuel, who by then had apparently won the confidence of his Arab minders, suggested that he and 'Abbas take a part of the army and raid over the Pass of Hadath into Byzantine Cappadocia. Once across the mountains, he and the other Byzantine captives neutralized 'Abbas and his escort, took their arms and escaped. 'Abbas and his companions were left behind unmolested, and allowed to return to Abbasid territory. Domestic of the Schools Theophilos welcomed Manuel with open arms, and named him Domestic of the Schools, commander of the elite tagma of the Scholae and de facto commander-in-chief of the entire army. Manuel would remain Theophilos's leading general for the remainder of his reign. Furthermore, as the uncle of Theophilos's wife, the Empress Theodora, his position at court was now unassailable, as shown by the fact that the Emperor later served as godfather for Manuel's children. The Syriac sources even report that Theophilos made Manuel governor of the \\"inner regions\\" of the Empire. The Byzantine army and Theophilos retreat towards a mountain after the Battle of Anzen, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. In 831, Manuel accompanied Theophilos in an expedition against a raid by the Cilician Arabs. The Byzantines caught up with the Arabs near the fort of Charsianon, and inflicted a heavy defeat upon them, killing 1,600 and taking some seven thousand prisoner. Manuel is also recorded as accompanying Theophilos on his great expedition in 837 against the Arab cities of northern Mesopotamia, which led to the sack of Zapetra and Arsamosata. This campaign, however, and the atrocities committed by the Byzantines' former Khurramite troops after the fall of Zapetra, provoked a large-scale retaliatory campaign by Caliph al- Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842). Manuel again accompanied the Emperor as his senior general, along with Nasr/Theophobos as commander of a large corps composed of former Khurramite refugees. Manuel participated in the disastrous Battle of Anzen on 22 July 838, where Theophilos confronted the army of general al- Afshin. During that battle, the imperial army broke and fled, and Theophilos with his retinue were surrounded by the Arabs on a hill with some 2,000 Khurramites. When some of the latter reportedly began planning to surrender the Emperor to the Arabs, Manuel seized the Emperor's horse by the bridle and forcibly led him away. With a few other officers, he managed to break through the Arab lines, and brought Theophilos to safety in the nearby village of Chiliokomon. During the battle, he received heavy wounds, and according to the chronicle of Symeon Logothetes, he died of them five days later, on 27 July 838. He was buried in his palace in Constantinople, which lay near the Cistern of Aspar and which became a monastery named after him, now traditionally identified with the Kefeli Mosque. Possible life after 838 The chronicles of Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus (and following them Skylitzes and Zonaras), however, report that he survived his wounds, allegedly being miraculously cured after renouncing iconoclasm at the behest of some monks. The same sources report that after Theophilos's death, he assumed the overall command of the Byzantine army and was appointed a member of the regency council for the infant new emperor Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867) along with Theoktistos and Bardas. His standing was so high that the populace is said to have acclaimed him as emperor at the Hippodrome, but he refused to accept the post. The same writers report that he played an important role in the restoration of the icons, and that he became a protomagistros before falling out with Theoktistos, being accused of l√®se-majest√©, and retiring from public life to his estates. According to the same sources, in the late 850s, he saved the Emperor's life in another battle at Anzen and died shortly after. Traditional scholarship has largely accepted this account, but some modern historians have expressed doubts as to its veracity. The Belgian Byzantinist Henri Gr√©goire was the first to highlight its incompatibility with the narrative of Symeon Logothetes, speculating that it was a later invention, possibly carried out by the monks of the Monastery of Manuel, who venerated him as a saint and tried to mitigate his iconoclast past. Warren Treadgold, who considers Symeon Logothetes more reliable, also dismissed the reports of Manuel's post-838 survival as invented. Other modern scholars continue to support the possibility of his continued life after 838, especially given the existence of a seal, dated to the mid-9th century, which names \\"Manuel patrikios, imperial protospatharios, magistros, and bagoulos of the Emperor\\", which seems to confirm both his survival into at least the early years of Michael III's reign, and his reported role as a member of the regency. Even so, the stories about his activities, and in particular his role in the restoration of the icons and the alleged second battle at Anzen (which is clearly inspired by the events of 838), are regarded as almost certainly fictitious. However, it may be that the story of his death after Theoktistos's downfall is reliable, which would probably place it sometime between 855 and 863.

It is a psychological thriller starring Michael Esposito, Beth Tegarden, and John Hurt as Dr. Turner. It was written and directed by David Wheeler and produced by Rob Landeros, who also designed the interactive features. The game was originally produced with the intention of releasing the game under the Trilobyte label, but Landeros was fired from the company before it was released. Tender Loving Care was later released under Landeros's new company, Aftermath Media, on CD-ROM, with the option for users to watch the movie as a feature-length film as opposed to interacting with the game. In October 2012 the game was re-released under the Trilobyte Games label on the Apple iOS platform. The game is based on the 1984 novel of the same name by Andrew Neiderman. Plot Michael Overton (Michael Esposito) and his wife Allison (Marie Caldare) are a couple who have been traumatized by the death of their daughter in a car accident. Allison has been especially affected, as she has been unable to even acknowledge that her daughter has died. She lives in a trance-like state and is unable to perform normal adult functions. Dr. Turner (John Hurt) recommends the Overtons hire a live-in nurse to assist with Allison's psychological healing. They hire a nurse recommended by Dr. Turner, Katherine Randolph (Beth Tegarden), whose unorthodox methods cause tensions to arise in the Overton home. Interactivity Producer/designer Rob Landeros described Tender Loving Care as not a game, but a film that the audience can have \\"a game-like experience while watching it.\\" The film is divided into a number of story episodes, between which the user interacts with the story in various ways. After viewing a story episode, users are asked a series of questions by Dr. Turner to test their perception of what they have seen. Users are then allowed to navigate through a graphic reconstruction of the Overton house, where they may gather additional details of the story. Before returning to the film or Apple device, users must take a short Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which profiles the user's psyche. The film includes alternate scenes and multiple endings which can be influenced by the user's involvement.review of Tender Loving Care, at Allgame. Development and release Director David Wheeler, who co-wrote Trilobyte's The 11th Hour, initially envisioned Tender Loving Care as a non-interactive film but after production efforts fell through, he re-teamed with Trilobyte to develop the title as a game. Due to Trilobyte's difficulties, Wheeler and Rob Landeros founded their own company, Aftermath Media to complete the project. The game saw limited success in North America, where it was primarily released as a DVD-Video title, but was more successful in Europe, particularly in Germany where it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign. However, Wheeler stated that royalties for the German release were to be paid to Trilobyte, which by the time of release was defunct. Landeros has stated that they never recouped the production budget. The 2012 iOS release was censored to comply with Apple's App Store guidelines.

The story follows a girl called \\"Alice\\" who has been kidnapped by a pedophile named Ray. Synopsis This book takes place five years after \\"Alice's\\" abduction. She is now 15, and is still living with Ray, her abductor. They pose as father and daughter, though they have no connections to anyone in the outside world. During this time, he has deprived her of food in order to keep her frozen in her childlike body, dresses her in childlike clothing, and has raped her every day. Ray also makes her sit in a chair as punishment when she is \\"bad\\". Alice refers to herself as the \\"Living Dead Girl\\": She is numb on the inside and is looking forward to the day when Ray will finally kill her, like he did the girl that he had abducted before her, the \\"First Alice\\". Ray had kept the First Alice until she was fifteen and her body had begun to mature. He then killed her and dumped her body, which was later found, but he had never been suspected. Alice now hopes for death, rather than for escape. Since the day he had taken her, he had threatened that if she ever ran from him or tried to contact police, he would kill her parents. By now, he has completely brainwashed her: she says, \\"I could run, but he would find me. He would take me back to 623 Daisy Lane and make everyone who lives there pay. He would make everyone there pay even if he didn't find me. I belong to him. I'm his little girl. All I have to do is be good.\\" So she \\"stays in line\\" even though she is left at their apartment alone all day while he is at work, and even goes to get bikini waxes done by herself. One day, Ray tells Alice he wants her to find him a \\"New Alice\\" for him. At first, Alice hopes that if she does, he will free her, or at least finally put her out of her misery. Instead, Ray tells her that she will train the new Alice to his liking. Alice takes trips down to the park where Ray had taken her once before and watches the young girls who play there. She writes down in a little notebook the different girls, what they do, and what they look like. She returns to Ray and he asks her to tell him all about these little girls. On one of her trips there, she meets Lucy, a young girl who likes to swing. After Lucy tells Alice that she doesn't like her, Alice decides that Lucy will be the one to replace her. Alice then meets Lucy's older brother, Jake, a troubled teenager who abuses prescription drugs. Alice returns to his car and has sex with him to try to get some information from him about Lucy. She finds out a little information about the girl's hobbies and schedule. Before she leaves, she also meets a police officer who has a feeling that Alice is in trouble. However, Alice knows that talking to the police will only get her in trouble with Ray, so she refuses to call for help. When Ray accuses Alice of lying to him about Lucy's whereabouts, Alice becomes confused, as Jake told her that Lucy would be at a local swimming pool. Alice returns later and finds Lucy standing in the park. She tries to tell her to run, but Ray appears and grasps Lucy by the arm. Alice collects her remaining life in her hollow body and shouts for Lucy to run. Ray gets so angry that he tries to strangle Alice. Jake shoots Ray dead, and inadvertently wounds Alice. As she lies dying, Alice tells Lucy that her name is Kyla Davis, and that she lives on 623 Daisy Lane. She then asks Lucy to take her home. Alice's final thought before she dies is \\"I am free.\\" Major Characters *Alice ‚Äî She was kidnapped by Ray, who sexually and physically abused her, and is now in her teens.

Reception In the assessment of Publishers Weekly, \\"Scott's prose is spare and damning, relying on suggestive details and their impact on Alice to convey the unimaginable violence she repeatedly experiences.

The team is led by Silver Sable. Publication history The Wild Pack first appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #265 and was created by Gregory Wright, Steve Butler, and Jim Sanders. Fictional team history The Wild Pack is first formed by Silver Sable's father, Ernst Sablinovia, for the apprehension of international criminals, and the recovery of stolen property for a wide spectrum of clients, from major insurance companies to small nations.The Amazing Spider-Man #265 (June 1985) As a young girl, Silver Sable witnesses her mother‚Äôs death at the hands of terrorists and it is then that she becomes determined to take over leadership of the group.Silver Sable & the Wild Pack #1 (June 1992) She joins her father's team at the age of 17 and is soon promoted to second-in-command. Later, her father embarks alone to track down his wife's killer. Silver and the Wild Pack catch up with him, in time to see the villain kill her father and escape with the body. Believing her father dead, Sable assumes command of the Wild Pack.Silver Sable & the Wild Pack #9 (February 1993) When the number of war criminals declines, Sable turns her Wild Pack toward other activities and begins selling her services around the world. The group eventually gains the approval of the Symkarian government and in fact becomes the major source of outside income for Symkaria.The Amazing Spider-Man #279 (August 1986) While typically composed of elite mercenary soldiers, Sable would occasionally hire superhuman freelance operatives to serve on the Pack such as Paladin,Marc Spector: Moon Knight #15 (June 1990) Prowler,The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #10 (August 1990) Rocket Racer, and Sandman.Solo Avengers #4 (March 1988) Alternatively, Sable has twice formed elite versions of the Wild Pack, composed of superhuman agents ‚Äî first with the Outlaws,Web of Spider-Man #50 (May 1989) and later, the Intruders.Silver Sable & the Wild Pack #16 (September 1993) Sable has also been known to parcel smaller-scale contracts to reduced versions of the Wild Pack such as the Delta Team.Silver Sable & the Wild Pack #10 (March 1993) Once, Silver Sable steps down from leadership of the Wild Pack. This was during a period of soul-searching after Silver Sable is believed to be pregnant, although this is actually due to a computer error. During this time, the Wild Pack is led by Sable's father who had not died, but was rescued from his captors by Sable and the Wild Pack. As Sable monitors the team's progress however, she feels compelled to step in and take an active hand in leadership once more, stating that the team is like a family to her and is where she belongs.Silver Sable & the Wild Pack #35 (April 1995) More recently, the Wild Pack has become more and more unstable. The elite agents who have worked with Silver Sable for a long time have gone their separate ways. Sable is left to lead a team that is becoming increasingly lazy and incompetent. After four unsuccessful missions and the betrayal of several agents, Silver Sable decides that the group has become too broken and fractured to maintain. Bringing her agents together one last time, Silver Sable informs them that she is going into retirement and that the Pack themselves will be dissolved.Sable and Fortune #1 (January 2006) The Outlaws Sable and the Wild Pack cross paths with many heroes over the years, such as Hawkeye,Solo Avengers #6 (May 1988) Le Peregine and Spider-Man. After a number of encounters with superhuman agents, vigilantes and enemies, Sable begins to use them in future assignments. Later, Sable decides to create an elite version of the Wild Pack, the Outlaws. The Outlaws feature Sable associates Prowler, Puma, Rocket Racer, Sandman and Will o' the Wisp. They encounter Excalibur in the course of their adventuresExcalibur #36 (April 1991) but are soon disbanded in favor of the traditional Wild Pack.Web of Spider-Man Annual #7 (September 1991) The Intruders Silver Sable continues to lead her Wild Pack in mercenary endeavors. She also hires the hero Battlestar to serve on the team. When the team begins attracting superhuman associates such as the Fin and Man-Eater, Sable forms another elite offshoot of the Wild Pack called the Intruders. Sandman leads the Intruders, which includes Fin, Lightbright, Man-Eater and Paladin. They often engage in assignments independently of the Wild Pack. Although the team never officially disbands, the Intruders are presumably dissolved by Silver Sable several months later.

Historical Atlas of China. Vol. 1. Taipei: Chinese Culture University Press, 1980. p. 49) was a 6th-century Indianized kingdom on the north coast of Central Java, Indonesia. It was the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in Central Java, and together with Kutai and Tarumanagara are the oldest kingdoms in Indonesian history. Historiography The archaeological findings and historical records from this period are scarce, and the exact location of kingdom's capital is unknown. It is thought to be somewhere between present-day Pekalongan or Jepara. A place named Keling subdistrict is found in northern coast of Jepara Regency, however some archaeological findings near Pekalongan and Batang regency shows that Pekalongan was an ancient port, suggests that Pekalongan might be an altered name of Pe-Kaling-an. Kalingga existed between the 6th and 7th centuries, and it was one of the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms established in Java. The historical record of this kingdom is scarce and vague, and comes mostly from Chinese sources and local traditions. History The Chinese sources come from China and date back to the Tang Dynasty. According to the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing, in 664 a Chinese Buddhist monk named Huining (ÊúÉÂØß Hu√¨n√≠ng) had arrived in Heling and stayed there for about three years. During his stay, and with the assistance of Jnanabhadra, a Heling monk, he translated numerous Buddhist Hinayana scriptures. In 674 the kingdom was ruled by Queen Shima, notorious for her fierce law against thievery, which encouraged her people to be honest and uphold absolute truth. According to tradition, one day a foreign king placed a bag filled with gold on the intersection in Kalingga to test the famed truthful and honesty of Kalingga people. Nobody dared to touch the bag that did not belong to them, until three years later when Shima's son, the crown prince, accidentally touched the bag with his foot. The queen issued a death sentence to her own son, but was over-ruled by a minister that appealed the queen to spare the prince's life. Since it was the prince's foot that touched the bag of gold, so it was the foot that must be punished through mutilation. According to Carita Parahyangan, a book composed in later period, Shima's great-grandson is Sanjaya, who is the king of Sunda Kingdom and Galuh Kingdom, and also the founder of Medang Kingdom. Between 742 and 755, the kingdom had moved further east from the Dieng Plateau, perhaps in response to the Buddhist Sailendras. Inscriptions The Tukmas inscription was estimated to be originated from Kalingga period. It was discovered on the western slope of Mount Merapi, at Dusun Dakawu, Lebak village, Kecamatan Grabag, Magelang Regency, Central Java, and is written in Pallava script in Sanskrit tells about a clear spring water that is so sacred that adored as the analogue of holy Ganges's source in India. The inscription also bears Hindu signs and imageries, such as trisula, kamandalu (water jar), parashu (axe), kalacengkha (shell), chakra and padma (red lotus), those are symbols of Hindu gods.IPS Terpadu Kelas VII SMP/MTs, Penerbit Galaxy Puspa Mega:Tim IPS SMP/MTs. Another inscription dated from around the same period is Sojomerto inscription, discovered in Sojomerto village, Kecamatan Reban, Batang Regency, Central Java. It is written in Kavi script in Old Malay language, estimated dated from 7th century. The inscription tell about a ruler named Dapunta Selendra, son of Santanu and Bhadrawati, and husband of Sampula. Indonesian historian Prof. Drs. Boechari suggested that Dapunta Selendra was the ancestor of Sailendras that later rule in Mataram Kingdom. Both inscriptions suggest that c. 7th century on the northern coast of Central Java, once flourish a Hindu Shivaist kingdom, today identified as Kalingga kingdom. Some oldest Javanese candis are also can be found in mountainous surrounding areas on northern Central Java, such as the Hindu temples of Dieng Plateau, and Gedong Songo temples, but they are probably built in later period, during the early Medang Kingdom. Historian suggested that there was a link between this old kingdom with later kingdom flourish in Southern Central Java Kedu Plain, the Sailendra of Medang i Bhumi Mataram.

After being dismissed from her position at the newspaper in September 2012 by its new, government-friendly owner, Jansz emigrated to the US, where she now lives.

Media and journalism Jansz \\"began her career as a war reporter for Visnews, the television arm of Reuters, during the Sri Lankan Civil War.\\" She conducted interviews with government soldiers and guerilla forces, and also served as an investigative journalist covering the Sri Lankan parliament. \\"As one of the only female journalists in Sri Lanka, she established herself as a respected political reporter and became the anchor of a morning news TV show.\\" The Sunday Leader She joined The Sunday Leader, which has been described as a ‚Äúpolitically fueled investigative newspaper‚Äù and as Sri Lanka‚Äôs ‚Äúlone independent voice,‚Äù in 1994, and was asked by Lal Wickrematunge to become its editor in January 2009 following the assassination of editor-in-chief Lasantha Wickrematunge, under whom she had trained. Wickrematunge \\"was ambushed by men on motorbikes who shot him through the head.\\" Like Wickrematunge, Jansz received threats due to her work, including death threats. She has stated that she began receiving these threats shortly after becoming editor. \\"I received one letter in red ink, saying 'B****, I will chop you up if you don't stop writing this,'\\" she told the Telegraph. The handwriting was the same as in a threatening letter that had been sent to Lasantha three weeks before his murder. On 22 October 2009 Jansz and News Editor Munza Mushtaq were sent hand written death threats through the post. \\"We will slice you up if you do not stop your writing,\\" the letters threatened. Jansz told Reporters Without Borders that Wickrematunge had received the same letter which his secretary had filed away. Jansz said the letters were compared by a graphologist, who confirmed that all three were written by the same person. Jansz said the letters were compared by a graphologist who confirmed all three letters were authored by the same palm In October 2010 the Sri Lanka Guardian magazine reported that Sri Lankan military intelligence was plotting to assassinate Jansz. Jansz was threatened and insulted by Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in a phone call on 6 July 2012. According to Jansz the Defence Secretary said \\"Yes I threatened you. Your type of journalists are f****** pigs who eat shit!...I will put you in jail!... People will kill you!!! People hate you!!!\\". At the end of the Sri Lankan civil war, in 2009, Jansz wrote an article suggesting that Sri Lanka's defence secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, \\"shared a similar psychological profile to that of the leader of the Tigers (a sworn enemy).\\" In the winter of 2010, ‚ÄúJansz interviewed the opposition candidate‚Äù in the presidential elections, ‚Äúa former army commander in the Sri Lankan army,‚Äù who confirmed rumours ‚Äúthat the army had shot a group of Tamil Tiger rebel leaders as they attempted to surrender at the end of the war.‚Äù When Jansz ran the story, it led to the opposition‚Äôs election loss, thus making the newspaper ‚Äúan enemy out of both the government and the opposition.‚Äù In 2012, Jansz learned that Rajapaksa had arranged for Sri Lankan Airlines to bump a flightload of passengers to transport a puppy from Switzerland to Sri Lanka for his wife.

She was replaced by Sakuntala Perera. \\"The new management appointed a new editor even as I was sitting in the office,\\" Jansz said in July 2013.

Its location is now covered by the area around Braunstone Gate, Leicester, and for much of the medieval period was a liberty within the parish of St Mary de Castro, Leicester, and hence, part of the Borough of Leicester. Bromkinsthorpe was bisected by the Roman road later known as Fosse Way, which led from Lincoln via Leicester to Cirencester and Exeter. It is presumed this road formed an early north western frontier to the Roman province of Britannia following the original invasion. Whilst there was a Roman villa in what later became Bromkinsthorpe, the first mention of the manor was in the Domesday Book of 1086. At that time it was held by Hugh de Grandmesnil along with 64 other manors in Leicestershire. He held six carucates in Bromkinsthorpe outright, with another two that formed part of the Soke of Ratby in west Leicestershire. In the Domesday Book the manor was recorded as belonging to Leicester, although it is not clear what this statement signified. There was also a link with the manor of Smeeton in south Leicestershire as four sokemen from there were 'attached' to Hugh de Grandmesnil's land in Bromkinsthorpe. Later, Bromkinsthorpe became part of the Earls of Leicester holdings. Two manors were recorded at Bromkinsthorpe in the 13th century. One was Walsh or Danet's Hall. The second was Westcotes. Both of these manors and their tenants are clearly documented thenceforward. Inhabitants farmed the open field strips surrounding the two manors. Some records suggest these strips formed one of the great open fields of Leicester. Others indicate that Bromkinsthorpe itself had three great open fields. The abbey of St Mary de Pratis, Leicester held considerable land in Bromkinsthorpe. The inhabitants also had rights in Leicester Forest, for which they were compensated when it was deforested in 1628. The manors were largely enclosed by the end of the 17th century. During the 18th century, urban Leicester encroached the manors, with some large houses, complete with extensive grounds and orchards built. These were demolished in the 19th century when new high-density housing was built that totally obliterated the rural aspect of Bromkinsthorpe. The manors were thus subsumed into the rapidly expanding Borough of Leicester.

This technique works on the relationship between the mind and the body and at developing an actor‚Äôs conscious awareness. In other words, recognizing the resulting sensory and mental states in reaction to physical stimuli. The pioneer of this technique is Konstantin Stanislavski who sought to overcome the divisions between ‚Äúmind from body, knowledge from feeling, analysis from action‚Äù through psychophysical training or the method of physical action, but it was Michael Chekhov who further developed an original and dependable method of what we now know to be psycho-physical awareness.  History  Based on the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavski, Michael Chekhov developed the technique in order to achieve the highest creative potential by developing extreme sensitivity of the body to the psychological creative impulses. He felt this was imperative in becoming an ‚Äòideal‚Äô actor. Chekhov developed a series of exercises influenced in part by Rudolf Steiner, which explore a psychophysical approach to training and performing. ‚ÄúIf the actor is engaged in the process of imagining through the body, then their sense of ‚Äòself‚Äô is forgotten, and the embodied imagination alters the psycho physicality to be or become that of the character.‚Äù Other pioneers and practitioners in this field that need mentioning include Phillip B. Zarrilli and Jerzy Grotowski. Zarilli‚Äôs most recent book, Psychophysical Acting: An Intercultural Approach after Stanislavski (2008) has been selected for the 2010 Outstanding Book award for the Association for Theatre in Higher Education (ATHE). Zarilli developed a system of training though yoga and Asian martial arts that heightens sensory awareness, dynamic energy, and in which body and mind become one. Jerzy Grotowski is known for using yoga as well as plastiques (a series of strenuous postures, gesture and tumbles) and the use of the whole body as a vocal resonator. He later found that adding human interaction (working with partners) loosened creativity and challenged the body more psychologically. Solo yoga postures he found to be limiting and isolating. An example of plastiques involves the vertebra extracted from Grotowski‚Äôs Towards a Poor Theatre, clarifies the connection between emotional and physical states of the actor. The energy must first start physically within for it to find its way out through expression, thereby engaging the need for psycho-physical awareness. The vertebral column is the center of expression. The driving impulse, however stems from the loins. Every live impulse begins in this region, even if it is invisible from the outside. Other physical acting training techniques relative to personal awareness, but not limited to, can be found in the exercises of Moshe Feldenkrais, Kristin Linklater, Cicely Berry and Frederick Matthias Alexander.

Education and service in Saxony Pezel was born in Plauen and educated at the universities of Jena and Wittenberg, his studies at the latter institution being interrupted by his teaching for several years. In 1557 he was appointed professor in the philosophical faculty and in 1569 was ordained preacher at the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg. In the same year he entered the theological faculty, where he soon became involved in the disputes between the followers of Melanchthon and Luther, writing the Apologia verae doctrinae de definitione Evangelii (Wittenberg, 1571) and being the chief author of the Wittenberg catechism of 1571. He soon took a leading position as a zealous Philippist, but in 1574 he and his colleagues were summoned to Torgau and required to give up the Calvinistic theory of the Lord's Supper. As they refused to subscribe to the articles presented to them, they were placed under surveillance in their own houses and forbidden to discuss or to print anything on the questions in dispute. They were afterward deposed from their professorships, and in 1576 were banished. Pezel, who had hitherto been at Zeitz, now went to Eger; but in 1577, like his fellow exiles, received a position from Count John of Nassau, first at the school in Siegen and later at Dillingen. Ministry in Nassau and Bremen Pezel then definitely accepted Calvinism, and the Church in Dillenburg was united to the Calvinistic body. In 1578 he became pastor at Herborn, and in 1580 was permitted by Count John to go for a few weeks to Bremen to try to reconcile the Church difficulties between the Calvinists and Lutherans. His task was difficult, however, since the Lutheran Jodocus Glanaeus refused to meet him in open debate. The civil authorities, construing this as contumacy, deposed Glanaeus, and Pezel preached in his place. He soon returned to Nassau, but in 1581 was permanently appointed the successor of Glanaeus at Bremen, where, four years later, he was made superintendent of the churches and schools. At the same time he became pastor of the Liebfrauenkirche, though he also retained his pastorate at the Ansgariikirche till 1598. He took an active part in improving and extending the work at the Bremen gymnasium, where he was professor of theology, moral philosophy, and history, being also the leader in all the theological controversies in which the Bremen church became involved. Pezel did away with Luther's Catechism, substituting for it his own Bremen catechism, which remained in force until the eighteenth century, removed images and pictures from the churches, formed a ministerium which united the clergy, and, by his Consensus ministerii Bremensis ecclesi√¶ of 1595, prepared the way for the complete acceptance of Calvinistic doctrine. Pezel died in Bremen, aged 64. Works Pezel was the editor Of many theological writings, of which the most important were the Loci theologici of his teacher, Victorinus Strigel (4 parts, Neustadt, 1581‚Äì84); Philip Melanchthon's Consilia (1600); and Caspar Peucer's Historia carcerum et liberationis divinae (Zurich, 1605); while among his independent works special mention may be made of the following: Argumenta et objectiones de praecipuis articulis doctrinae Christianae (Neustadt, 1580‚Äì89); Libellus precationum (1585); and Mellificium historicum, complectens historiam trium monarchiarum, Chaldaicae, Persicae, Graecae (1592). He is particularly interesting as showing the evolution from Melanchthon's attitude toward predestination to the complete determinism of the Calvinistic concept of the dogma.

Background After returning from World War I, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. lived in various places around the United States from New York to California and back again - along the way trying his hand at founding a newspaper and failing.Doherty (2013) pp.59-66 In early 1933, he departed for Paris and began traveling around European capitals, along with two French cameramen, ultimately ending up in Vienna to cover mass meetings and political demonstrations.\\"Van Newsreels Vienna\\", Variety, May 30, 1933; 19., cited in Doherty Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939 (2013), p. 60 Although Vanderbilt had his sights set on an interview with Adolf Hitler, he asked the former Crown Prince of Germany, whom he had previously interviewed, why \\"you Hohenzollerns are so much easier to see than Hitler?\\"Doherty,(2013), p.61 Finally on March 5, 1933, the day that the Nazis obtained a parliamentary plurality, Vanderbilt was able to secure what would be the closest he would get to an interview with Hitler. Amid the chaos, Vanderbilt yelled, \\"And what about the Jews, Your Excellency?\\", referring to the so-called \\"Jewish problem\\". Hitler shrugged off the question and instructed Vanderbilt to set up a meeting with Dr. Ernst Hanfstaengl, one of Hitler's intimates at the time. This meeting never took place.The circumstances surrounding the encounter with Hitler are related in Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr., \\"Under the Sign of the Three H's\\", Redbook, June 1933, 30-31, 98-101, and, with slightly different wording, in Vanderbilt Jr.'s memoir, Farewell to Fifth Avenue, 191, 175-81, 193-94., cited in Doherty (2013), p.61 Story The picture opens with a re-enacted phone call between reporter Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. in Germany and narrator Edwin C. Hill in New York. Then a parade of people carrying torchlights in Berlin, where Jewish works and other political books are burned. Vanderbilt meets with Hill, and then flies out of the country. Hill talks with Vanderbilt about the problems in his country, then a re-enacted interview between Adolf Hitler and Vanderbilt. During a viewing of World War I battle footage, Hitler's home town, Leonidad, Austria, and his parents' graves are shown. Vanderbilt goes to Vienna, to see Chancellor Dollfuss, and he films several Austrian Nazi riots during a parade. In a re-enactment, Vanderbilt's passport is stolen, and there are several shots of Nazis abusing Jews. In yet another re-enactment, Vanderbilt interviews Crown Prince Wilhelm, and more books are burned. Helen Keller talks to an interviewer about her books, which were burned by the Nazis. Then a conversation between Vanderbilt, Kaiser Wilhelm II in Doorn, Holland, and Prince Louis Ferdinand is re-enacted. Actual anti-Nazi speeches given by prominent Jews and some Gentiles are shown, and the Nazis are shown trying to alter the Bible. In the final scene, Congressman Samuel Dickstein of New York and Hill give speeches directly to the audience, explaining the dangers of Nazism. Production The 65 minutes of Hitler's Reign of Terror combines footage that Vanderbilt shot, after his \\"interview\\" with Hitler, of Jewish refugees in Germany; previously compiled American newsreel footage; and reenactments of the various conversations and interactions that Vanderbilt had with officials while traveling throughout Europe. Initially, Vanderbilt found it difficult to find a major production company to produce the film. However, he worked out a partnership with two different producers, Joseph Seiden and Samuel Cummins. Vanderbilt edited the film with Edwin Hill and hired Mike Mindlin, known for his adult film This Nude World (1933), as the director.Doherty, Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939 (2013), p. 62 Reception Hitler's Reign of Terror made its debut in theaters at the Mayfair Theatre on New York's Broadway on April 30, 1934. The movie brought the theater's biggest opening day on record to that point.\\"Hitler Film Packs New York Mayfair\\", Hollywood Reporter, May 1, 1934: 1., cited in Doherty (2013), p.63 The Production Code Administration (PCA) was not yet operational; however, the film was still subject to scrutiny from the more familiar Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). Rory Norr was sent by the MPPDA to view the film at its opening, and report back on whether he felt the content was appropriate for the big screen. His conclusions were that the film \\"included only a few original 'reproductions' of alleged interviews had by Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. with the Kaiser, Mr. Hitler, and others. A general statement on the screen covered the fact that such interviews were 'reproductions' and it was obvious that the actors took the parts of the Kaiser, Hitler, and others in certain scenes.\\" As such, he concluded on the question of whether or not the movie should be considered a propaganda film and banned from theaters, \\"The fact that it is a propaganda picture does not make it necessarily unsuitable for the screen... There is no more reason why a theater owner may not take a given side on a public question than why a newspaper publisher should not adopt definite policy one way or another re Hitlerism.\\"Mr. Norr to Maurice McKenzie, \\"Re Film: Hitler's Reign of Terror\\" (Hitler's Reign of Terror file, PCA files)., cited in Doherty (2013), p.65 The German reaction to the film, however, was not as favorable. Upon request from the German ambassador in Washington D.C., a review conducted by George R. Canty on behalf of the Department of Commerce yielded the result that, \\"the film serves no good purpose.\\"George R. Canty to J.C. White, June 16, 1934. Record Group 151, Records of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce., cited in Doherty (2013), p.65 After the Department of Commerce review, many further American censors followed suit in their fear to offend the Nazis. The New York State Censor Board, for one, eventually banned the film throughout the state.\\"Denied License by Censor, Call 'Hitler' News Film\\", Film Daily, May 1, 1934: 1, 3., cited in Doherty (2013), p.65 After having passed the review of the Chicago Board of Censors, Hitler's Reign of Terror became the subject of concern for Chicago's Nazi consul, who eventually convinced the city government to halt the release of the film until certain changes were made.Doherty, (2013), p.65 Loss and rediscovery In 2013, Thomas Doherty published Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939, which explored the relationship between the American film industry and Nazi Germany. In his early research, Doherty was not able to locate a single copy of Hitler's Reign of Terror. Late into his research, however, Doherty received news that the Royal Belgian Film Archive in Brussels had located a copy of the film in their possession. Doherty's theory is that a Belgian film distributor must have ordered a copy of the film from outside the country before the Nazis invaded Belgium. Being a foreign film, the copy had to clear customs. After the Nazis invaded the country, though, the distributor likely did not want to be caught with the film, and never picked it up from customs. As a result, the film lay on a back shelf in cold storage in Belgium for almost eighty years.

The streak was threatened when they faced fellow unbeaten team, the PCU Dolphins, at the end of the first round. Both sporting 6-0 records, the game went into overtime, and Boyet Bautista and John Paul Alcaraz saved the day for the Knights beat the Dolphins resulting a first round sweep. The streak ended when the Mapua Cardinals, led by the former All-Canadian Kelvin dela Pe√±a beat the Knights as Letran failed to stop dela Pe√±a and collapsed at the end game.(If Letran won that 2nd round game against Mapua, the Knights could have already scored a 14-0 sweep of the eliminations) The Knights recovered as they blew out the Stags, and swept the regular season series vs. PCU in the season finale. =PCU Dolphins= The defending champions PCU Dolphins also had their own 6-0 streak, beating Mapua and CSB. But it was ended by Letran (see above) in a tight contest. Then came the shock loss against the San Beda Red Lions under San Beda's debuting coach Koy Banal. The Dolphins bounced back, beating last year's runner-up UPHSD Altas. However, PCU was defeated by the San Sebastian Stags in their second round rematch. On the next game, they clinched the twice to beat advantage when they beat Mapua. However, they failed to beat Letran in the regular season. =Mapua Cardinals= The Mapua Cardinals had their best start in fourteen years as they boasted a 4-0 card. But losses against defending champions PCU Dolphins and Intramuros arch rivals Letran dropped their record to 4-2. A buzzer-beater by Neil Pascual off a Kelvin dela Pe√±a pass against the CSB Blazers kept their Final Four hopes alive. But successive loses against underachievering teams Perpetual Altas and JRU Heavy Bombers put the Final Four aspirations in doubt. After successive wins against the San Beda Red Lions and CSB Blazers, the Cardinals found confidence in their game, and they beat the then undefeated Letran Knights under the heroics of Kelvin dela Pe√±a and Joferson Gonzales. PCU defeated them again in the eliminations, depriving the Cardinals for a twice to beat advantage in the semis. Mapua bounced back and scored a victory against the Stags. (It can be said that if the Cardinals have beaten the Bombers and the Altas, then they would have been seeded as second, armed with a twice-to-beat advantage in the Semifinals and could've been in the Finals.) =San Sebastian Stags= After failing to enter the Final Four for the first time since its inception in 1998, the Stags are itching to bring back the glory to their school. With 2003 NCAA MVP Leomar Najorda and Redentor Vicente, the Stags look poised to barge back into the Final Four. But with a disappointing 0-3 start, the Stags needed to win against the then undefeated CSB Blazers (3-0). Under the exploits of Najorda and Vicente, the Stags won the game. The rest of season was a roller-coaster ride, with San Sebastian winning games against weaker teams. But a win against the PCU Dolphins finally sealed their Final Four appearance. BracketSemifinalsLetran‚ÄìSan Sebastian series= The Knights, which had previously routed the Stags in their two elimination round games, dealt their opponents a 32‚Äì6 fourth quarter run that blew the game wide open and eliminated San Sebastian from championship contention. The Knights qualified for their second Finals stint in three years. =PCU‚ÄìMapua series= With the game tied 49‚Äìall at the start of the fourth quarter, the Dolphins staged a 21‚Äì2 with last year's Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Rob Sanz scoring key three-pointers to erect a 72‚Äì51 advantage at the final two minutes. The defending champions qualified for their second consecutive Finals stint, against Letran, whom they eliminated the previous year in the semifinals in two games. Finals Letran and PCU started their two-year rivalry in the 2004 tournament, when the Dolphins eliminated the Knights in the do-or-die semifinal game that went into overtime via former Knight Ronjay Enrile's flubbed freethrows. The Dolphins then beat 2004's first seed UPHDS Altas in two games, taking their first NCAA seniors basketball title. =Game 1= Trailing 65‚Äì70 when Gabby Espinas fouled out, Jayson Castro and Sanz each had a three-pointer in the deciding 11‚Äì0 PCU run to put the Dolphins ahead, 76‚Äì70 with less than five minutes left. After Jonathan Alvade made a field-goal to cut the lead to three at 74‚Äì77, the Dolphins defense prevented another Letran scoring opportunity the rest of the way as they held on to stun the Knights, which had only one loss in the season prior to the game. =Game 2= In an elimination game for Letran, they scored 25 points in the second quarter to erect a 44‚Äì33 lead at halftime. They increased their lead to a commanding 54‚Äì33 lead after preventing the Dolphins from scoring in the first five minutes of the third quarter. The Dolphins will cut the lead to fourteen, but that was the nearest they were able to get as the Knights tied the series to force a deciding Game 3. =Game 3= *Finals Most Valuable Player: Letran and PCU were locked in a tight contest at the first quarter, although the Dolphins never led; Letran's Boyet Bautista hit a running three-pointer at the end of the first quarter to prevent the Dolphins from getting close. In the second quarter, Letran twice led by as many as ten points, but the Dolphins limited the Knights to 5 points and a single field-goal to cut Letran's lead. PCU would eventually stare at a 43‚Äì41 deficit at the start of the fourth quarter, but Bautista scored on a lay-up that prevent further PCU incursions as the Knights cruised to the victory, and their second championship in three years. Bautista would be named as Finals MVP as he led Letran to their 16th men's basketball title.

It provided service between the two cities listed in its corporate name. Chartered on March 7, 1867, it was built between 1867 and 1871 and first provided passenger service between these two cities on July 8, 1871. The railroad is best known for being the right-of-way for the Rock Island Trail State Park, a rail trail conversion. History The Peoria and Rock Island (P & RI) was built during the post-American Civil War 1860s, a period of substantial railroad development, especially in the victorious Northern states. Although both Peoria, Illinois and Rock Island, Illinois are located on navigable waterways and enjoyed substantial freight traffic by steamboat, there would be no direct water connection between the Upper Mississippi River and the Illinois River until the construction of the Hennepin Canal in 1907. The Peoria and Rock Island, for legal purposes, changed its name to the Rock Island and Peoria Railway in October 1877. Rock Island as Peoria terminus The largest railroad serving Rock Island was the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, a multi-state railroad that soon acquired the smaller Rock Island and Peoria. On June 11, 1903, the former P & RI became a branch line of the larger transportation company. As a branch line, the P & RI specialized in the transportation of freight from the \\"Rock Island's\\" Great Plains service area to Peoria. During the early years of the 20th century, distilleries in Peoria manufactured a significant share of U.S. produced blended whiskey. Carloads of small grains such as rye and barley rumbled southeastward on the former Peoria and Rock Island to the fermentation vats. The enactment of American Prohibition in 1919, together with the invention of the mass-produced automobile, dealt the former Peoria and Rock Island a blow from which it could not recover. The Rock Island railroad began to shut down its Peoria branch line in 1963. While that section of the P & RI that stretches from Peoria north to Toulon, Illinois became a public trail in 1989, the northern section of the same right-of-way, between Toulon and Rock Island, was liquidated into the hands of adjacent landowners in the private sector.

Suiyo consists of a basaltic to dacitic submarine caldera and lava dome, and rises about from its base on the sea floor to within of the surface. Suiyo has a prominent summit caldera, wide and deep.

Suiyo is covered by a thick sediment cap, a feature that collects over a long span of inactivity, and fault patterns and valleys have been observed on its flanks. Suiyo Seamount is associated with a magnetic anomaly: ocean-floor surveys of it and the surrounding area found that a large negative rock body existed to the east of the seamount, while positive bodies existed to the northwest and south. The reasons for this complex anomaly, which also exists in several other nearby seamounts, is unknown, but is suggested to be the result of interactions between different magnetic fields of different ages. A burst of hydrothermal activity was observed in July 1991, raising water temperatures at the vent to ; following the event, the volcano, until then thought extinct, was reclassified as active by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

Early life Aylward was born at Brede Rectory in Brede, East Sussex, England in 1862, the daughter of the Rector of Brede, Augustus Aylward and his wife Mary, who was the eldest daughter of Thomas Frewen of Brickwall in Sussex. Aylward studied at the Guildhall School. Aylward began composing at an early age, and her songs began to be performed at local concerts when she was 12. Career Aylward's early composition efforts caught the attention of William Boosey, of the publisher Boosey & Hawkes. Aylward's first song was published in 1888, entitled \\"Day Dawn\\". The words were based on a translation of a Victor Hugo poem by Alice K. Sawyer, with music composed by Aylward. The Graphic described it as a \\"simple and graceful ballad\\". In 1890, a collection of six of her compositions was published for soprano under the title \\"Album of Six Songs\\", which included \\"The Boat of My Lover\\", \\"An Egyptian Lament\\" and \\"The Milkmaid's Song\\". Family life Aylward married Harold Kinder, an architect, in 1881 in Rye, Sussex. They had one son, Harold, born in 1886. Aylward's husband died in 1940.

A former d√©butante from an illustrious family, she was jailed for passing a fraudulent cheque in 1951 and her best-known works were based on her experiences in prison. She wrote the semi- autobiographical Who Lie in Gaol, filmed as The Weak and the Wicked, and the novel Yield to the Night, the basis for the film starring Diana Dors. Early years Henry was born on 8 April 1914 in Belgravia, London. She was descended from Prime Ministers John Russell (her great-great-grandfather) and Robert Peel, and was the cousin once removed of Bertrand Russell. She was raised by grandparents in Ireland after her parents separated. After returning to England and finishing her education, she made her society d√©but in 1932. She had a twin sister, Diana G. Peel, who died at the age of 21. In 1938 she married army officer Donald Standage; the couple had one daughter. The marriage broke down in the late 1940s and they were divorced by 1950. After getting into debt through gambling, Henry accepted a forged cheque from a friend as a loan. She was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1951 and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. She served eight months, the majority at Holloway prison, and also at Askham Grange open prison. At the latter, she came under the care of Anglo-Irish prison reformer Mary Size, who she later described in her 1952 book Who lie in gaol as \\"a mixture of discipline and humanity.\\" Career Before her imprisonment, Henry earned a living writing romance novels. She came to prominence in 1952 with the publication of Who Lie in Gaol (the title was taken from a line in Oscar Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol), based on her experiences in prison, which became a best-seller. Henry was critical of Holloway prison, giving accounts of brutal treatment and neglect she had witnessed. The book was the basis for the film The Weak and the Wicked (1953), directed by J. Lee Thompson with Glynis Johns playing a character based on Henry. Yield to the Night (the title was taken from Book VII of the Iliad), a novel following a woman awaiting execution, was published in 1954. A film version was released in 1956 with Diana Dors in the lead role. Henry co- wrote the script, which was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best British Screenplay. The film was again directed by Lee Thompson, who Henry married in 1958. In 1960 Henry's play Look on Tempests was staged at the Comedy Theatre in London's West End. It continued Henry's focus on the justice system, depicting the effect on the upper middle class family of a man accused of gross indecency, and became the first play dealing with homosexuality to be approved for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, who had lifted a ban on the subject the previous year. Henry also wrote two television plays, Rough Justice in 1962 and Person to Person in 1967. She and Lee Thompson divorced in the late 1960s.

Having spent the earlier part of career based in his native Manchester, he later settled near Conwy in North Wales. He was an early member of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts, and a leading figure in the formation of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art. Life Arthur in the Gruesome Glen The Awakening of Christian Mountain mist, sun rise Whaite was born in Manchester in 1828. His father, Henry, owned an art gallery and picture framing business, which also supplied painted banners for rallies and meetings.Lord 1998, p.12 Whaite was educated at Manchester Grammar School before matriculating to the Manchester School of Design. He later moved to London to complete his education, studying at Leigh's School in Newman Street and at the Royal Academy in Somerset House. He visited Switzerland in 1850, and inspired by the mountain scenery planned to return the following year, but this proved impracticable. Unable to return to Switzerland, he looked for mountain scenery nearer home, and in 1851 made his first visit to Betws-y-Coed, a village in the Conwy Valley in North Wales which had already become a favourite destination for artists.Lord 1998, p.64 The landscape of the area was to become the main subject of his work for the rest of his life. For the next twenty years, however, he remained based in Manchester, living in Stretford and becoming a member of the newly established Manchester Academy of Fine Arts in 1859. Then, in 1870, he took a house called Tyddyn Cynal on the river about 3 miles from Conwy, which became his permanent residence.Lord 1998, p.106 In 1876 he married a local woman, Jane Alice Griffiths. They had one daughter, Lily Florence Whaite, who also became a notable artist. In 1881 Whaite led a group of English and Welsh artists in forming the Cambrian Academy of Art, later the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art, the first art Academy in Wales. He later became the President of the Cambrian Academy and in 1892 became president of the Manchester Academy, a post he held until his death. A bronze of Whaite by Irish artist John Cassidy was commissioned and completed in 1898. He died in 1912 and was buried at Llangelynnin New Church. Work Whaite displayed a vibrant style in his watercolours, and was noted for his ability to capture changing weather conditions in his landscapes, which often evoked a religious wonder. His religious beliefs were a strong influence on his work, and although his faith emerged in his work through an attached moral significance to the landscape, he also painted explicitly Christian themes as in The Awakening of Christian (c. 1885) and Arthur in the Gruesome Glen. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1851. In 1859 his paintings were reviewed by John Ruskin in his Academy Notes. Although generally positive, Ruskin warned of the dangers of Whaite's excessively minute technique. Discussing his Barley Harvest, the critic wrote: > Very exquisite in nearly every respect; perhaps, take it all in all the most > covetable bit of landscape this year, and showing good promise, it seems to > me, if the painter does not overwork himself needlessly. The execution of > the whole by minute and similar touches is a mistake.John Ruskin (1859), > Academy Notes, quoted in Lord 1998, p.84. When all of Whaite's submissions to the Academy's exhibition of 1865 were rejected, he took them to Ruskin, who provided detailed criticism, illustrating his remarks on their shortcomings with reference to sketches and drawings by Turner.Lord 1998, p.104 His oil paintings often used spots of pure colour, a consequence of his interest in colour theory, which may have pre- empted the pointillism strand of Impressionism that developed elsewhere in Europe.

Originally constituted the 325th Fighter Control Squadron in March 1943, the 325th served in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations during WWII. During the past decades, radar operations and maintenance has been taught to tens of thousands of personnel of all ranks. Following the transfer of the 325th Fighter Wing to Air Combat Command, on 12 October 2012 the 325th Air Control Squadron was replaced by the 337th Air Control Squadron under the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base. Mission The 325th was primarily responsible for the initial training of all Active duty, Air National Guard, and Reserve Air Force Air Battle Manager officers in command and control mission execution. The squadron provided training international officers in command and control operations, as well as command and control support for F-22A Raptor initial and transition training at Tyndall AFB. History=World War II The \\"Screamin' Eagles\\" began as the 325th Fighter Control Squadron in April 1943. In December 1943, the unit moved to North Africa to support the operations of the American and other Allied flying units. Moving its radar with the front lines, the squadron saw action throughout the Mediterranean and Southern Europe and earned battle streamers for Rome, 1944; Southern France, 1944; and the Rhineland, 1945. The squadron was disbanded in early 1945, when German air activity had effectively ceased. Controller training The 325th Tactical Training Squadron was activated in October 1983 and overtime absorbed the controller training mission conducted at Tyndall Air Force Base. After being renamed the 325th Training Squadron in November 1991 the two squadrons were consolidated in June 1999. In 2001 the squadron was redesignated as the 325th Air Control Squadron. In addition to the F-22, the squadron also assisted with the training of McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle pilots until their departure from tyndall in 2010. The squadron instructed five comprehensive courses. The primary course was the nine-month Undergraduate Air Battle Manager Training course, where officers learned everything from radar theory to large force employment. Graduates of this course receive follow-on assignments to the combat Air Forces to perform air battle management on the Boeing E-3 Sentry or the Boeing E-8 Joint STARS aircraft. Additional courses include the Battle Manager Instructor Training Course, which teaches air battle managers from different backgrounds the skills necessary to instruct undergraduate students, and the Air Weapons Officer/Weapons Director Initial Qualification Training Course, which teaches previously qualified air battle managers and weapons directors the art and science of controlling live aircraft. The 325th ACS also conducts the International Air Weapons Controller Course and the Theater Air Operations Course, where officers from around the world are introduced to weapons control and theater air operations.

Publication history The New York Times made the following announcement on July 14, 1900, > \\"A young romantic novelist, Miss Bertha Runkle, of New York City, will make > her debut in the August Issue of The Century Magazine with the first > chapters of a novel which will run through eight numbers of the periodical. > The work is described as a dramatic romance of love and adventure, and is > entitled \\"The Helmet of Navarre\\".

Miss Runkle is the daughter of Mrs. L.G. Runkle, a woman > well known in New York literary circles.\\" Runkle was only twenty-one when the book appeared in the Century Magazine. She had the story in her mind for two years or so, and the actual writing took about four months. The title was taken from a passage in Thomas Babbington Macaulay's poem Ivry, which its author adopted as a motto: > \\"Press where ye see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war, > \\"And be your oriflamme today, the helmet of Navarre.\\"Thomas Babington > Macaulay (1847) Lays of ancient Rome, Longman, London (a later digitized > German edition by Google Books can be read at ) The book went on to become No. 3 on the list of bestselling novels in the United States for the entire year of 1901 as determined by The New York Times. The year of its release, she teamed up with playwright Lawrence Marston to adapt her story to the Broadway stage in a production by Charles Frohman. Critical response The home where Runkle wrote The Helmet of Navarre in New York A 1901 review of the book had the following to say about it, > \\"The book came out with a great shouting, a banging of drums, blaring of > trumpets, and tons of advertising, and it was not a book that one could > easily ignore, for great black letters heralding its power, its beauty, and > its great worth stared at one from the pages of every newspaper and > magazine.

They are considered to be the first physical flags created by Manuel Belgrano, who in November 1813 hid the standards to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. They were discovered in 1885. Bolivia kept one of those flags at Sucre; the other was given to Argentina in 1896 and is currently kept at the National Historical Museum.

The flag preserved in Argentina is a triband of blue, white and blue bands, like the modern flag of Argentina, but the one kept in Bolivia is a triband of white, blue and white. History The Flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano during the Argentine War of Independence. After concluding the Paraguay campaign, he moved to Rosario to build artilleries. While being in the village he noticed that both the royalist and patriotic forces were using the same colors, Spain's yellow and red. He requested to the First Triumvirate a new cockade, which was approved by a decree on February 18, 1812. The colours of this cockade were white and light blue.Torres, p. 20 Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colours nine days later. The flag was first flown, for the soldiers to swear allegiance to it, on 27 February 1812, on the Bater√≠a Libertad (Liberty Battery), by the Paran√° River. Although it is known that this first flag had white and light blue colours, the design is unknown by historians, and could be either a blue-white-blue triband, or white-blue-white.Torres, p. 21 Belgrano wrote a letter to the Triumvirate to inform it of the new flag, saying that \\"...being in need to raise a flag, and not having one, I made it to be done white and light blue according to the colours of the national cockade...\\";\\"Siendo preciso enarbolar bandera, y no teni√©ndola, la mand√© hacer blanca y celeste conforme a los colores de la escarapela nacional\\" (Belgrano) - Torres, p. 22 which did not detail the actual design. Still uninformed of this, the Triumvirate dispatched Belgrano to Salta, to reinforce the Army of the North. This gave room to another unclear detail: whenever Belgrano left the physical flag in Rosario, or took it with him to the North.Torres, pp. 23-24 Belgrano dispatched a letter addressed to the First Triumvirate, informing them of the newly created flag. However, unlike with the cockade, the Triumvirate did not accept the use of the flag: the international policy at the time was to state that the government was ruling on behalf of Ferdinand VII king of Spain captive of Napoleon, whereas the creation of a flag was a clear independentist act. Thus, the triumvirate sent a warning to Belgrano not to fight under the flag, but by the time the reply had arrived, Belgrano had moved to the north, following the previous orders that requested him to strengthen the patriotic position in the Upper Peru after the defeat of Juan Jos√© Castelli at the Battle of Huaqui. Still unaware about the Triumvirate's refusal, Belgrano raised the flag at San Salvador de Jujuy and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. Belgrano accepted the orders from the Triumvirate by time they arrived to Salta and ended using the flag. As soldiers had already made oaths to the new flag, Belgrano said that he was saving it for the circumstance of a great victory. The priest Juan Ignacio Gorriti blessing the flag. The First Triumvirate was later replaced by the Second Triumvirate, with a more liberal ideology, who called the Asamblea del A√±o XIII. This assembly authorized to use the flag as a War flag, but not as a national one. The first oath to the newly approved flag was on February 13, 1813, next to the Salado River, which is also known since then as \\"R√≠o Juramento\\" (\\"Oath River\\"). The first battle fought with the approved flag was the Battle of Salta, a decisive patriotic victory that achieved the complete defeat of royalist P√≠o Trist√°n. The army moved to the north, but was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma. After those defeats, the army retreated to the South. Fearing that the enemy armies got the flags, he left them to the care of the parish priest of Macha, which hid them behind a Saint Teresa of Avila's portrait in a chapel near the small hamlet of Titiri (). Belgrano was summoned back to Buenos Aires, and sent to Europe in diplomatic mission, and the flags was considered to be lost. The flags were discovered many decades later, in 1885. The new priest was cleaning and restoring the chapel, and found them. The flags were moved to the \\"Museum of the Independence\\" in Sucre, which kept one of the flags. The other was delivered to Argentina in 1896, after a request from Argentine ambassador to Bolivia Adolfo Carranza. This last one is kept at the National Historical Museum, which works in restoring it. Preservation The National Historical Museum started to restore the Flag in 2007, making a study of it.El Museo Hist√≥rico Nacional restaura la bandera m√°s antigua del pa√≠s Mar√≠a P√≠a Tamborini and Patricia Lissa were in charge of the restoration. The flag is made of silk, and only 70% of it remains.La bandera de Belgrano vuelve a vivir gracias a la restauraci√≥n It was kept under bad conditions over the years, and the silk used was not of high quality. For this reason, the original colours could not be restored, which were indigo blue and ivory white. The flag is kept inside a closed cabinet, at a room with low lights. It was made available to the view of the public in 2010, year of the Argentina Bicentennial. See also * Flag of Argentina * Manuel Belgrano Bibliography * *Goman, Adolfo Mario (2007).

Bucquet and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. This was the fourth of a total of ten Dr. Kildare pictures, Lew Ayres starred in the last nine. Plot summary Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore), racing against time in his battle with melanoma, is about to start an important research project at Blair General Hospital to improve the use a Sulfa drug, Sulfapyridine, as a cure for pneumonia with the help of his assistant, Dr. James Kildare (Lew Ayres). Paul Messenger (Lionel Atwill), a Wall Street tycoon, asks for Gillespie's help in diagnosing the drastic, sudden personality changes that occur in his daughter Nancy (Helen Gilbert). Gillespie assigns Kildare to pose as an old friend of the family in order to observe Nancy. At the same time, Gillespie borrows an airplane to fly Kildare around the country collecting blood samples for Gillespie to examine around the clock. When Gillespie collapses from exhaustion, Kildare forces the cranky old doctor to take a rest as a patient and persuades Blair head of hospital Dr. Carew (Walter Kingsford) to assign him to work full-time on the Messenger case. Kildare's move forces Gillespie to put the project on hold, and while the old doctor goes fishing on a much needed vacation, Kildare, still hiding his identity as a doctor, begins to investigate the causes of Nancy's symptoms. He learns that Nancy's symptoms began to appear when she feared she had lost the love of her fiance. While talking with Nora (Sara Haden), the family housekeeper, Kildare learns that Nancy suffers blinding headaches. Nora, who disdains all doctors because of their inability to help Nancy's mother, has convinced Nancy that she is suffering from the same type of brain tumor that killed her mother. Nora takes Nancy to see a nature healer named John Xerxes Archley (Grant Mitchell), which prompts Kildare to admit that he is a doctor and dispute Archley's diagnosis of a \\"brain tumor\\" but alienates him from the family. With the help of ambulance driver Joe Wayman (Nat Pendleton) and his trusty monkey wrench, Kildare gets access to Nancy, who now has hysterical blindness. Kildare tries to consult with the vacationing Gillespie over the girl's symptoms but is rebuffed. Gillespie returns to Blair ostensibly to give a lecture to the interns on treating psychosomatic symptoms. Following Gillespie's advice, Kildare pretends to operate on Nancy's eyes and arranges for the first person she sees afterwards to be her fiance, thus curing her hysterical blindness. Meanwhile, Gillespie returns from his vacation revived, and realizing that Kildare quit the experiment only out of concern for his health, reconciles with his assistant. Together they embark again on their research into curing pneumonia.

As of 2002, both brands are operated by Windsor Quality Food Company, LTD, which is ultimately owned by the Hojel and Meinig families through their holding company HM International based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.HM Website description Retrieved October 12, 2010 Fred Luker Fred W. Luker was an entrepreneur and inventor. In 1947, he established Fred's Frozen Foods to provide frozen meat patties and frozen bread vegetables to the wholesale food service industry. Fred's Frozen Foods grew as the food service customers were experience increased growth as consumers began to dine away from home. In the late 1950s, Fred Luker perfected a method of applying a coating of crumbs of breading to a slice of raw meat and subsequently compressing the slice of meat under pressure to embed the crumbs deeply and evenly into the meat. The result was the processed meat patty would be 150% larger. Fred Luker applied for a patent in January 1962. The Marten Family Purchases Fred's Frozen Foods In 1960, John S. Marten was managing the Sexton Foods Indianapolis manufacturing plan. At an Indianapolis institutional food service trade show that year, John Marten met Fred Luker. Fred Luker was a 62-year-old frozen food entrepreneur who had developed a small frozen food manufacturing company in Noblesville, Indiana with $500,000 a year in sales. While building his company, Fred developed a process of breading and freezing meat. John S. Marten realized the process could be patented. Fred Luker was looking to retire and sell his business. In early 1961, the Marten Family entered into an agreement to purchase Fred's Frozen Foods from Fred Luker with the stipulation that Fred file a patent (granted in 1965) on his breading process. In November 1961, John S. Marten and his brother Harry Marten left Sexton Foods. The Marten brothers had advocated an expansion of the Sexton Foods product line to include a frozen food line. However, other family members did not believe that the traditional Sexton customer would be interested in frozen foods since the capital required for restaurants to install freezers and refrigerators was large. In addition, Sexton Foods was reluctant to make the large investment to install freezers in the Sexton warehouses and convert the Sexton delivery fleet to freezer trucks. The value the Marten brothers saw was that a restaurant, hotel or cafeteria could save on food preparation labor by buying prepared frozen foods that were heat and serve. Frozen foods were priced higher than canned goods and also require the customers have freezer storage. However, the value to the customers was reduced costs in delivering quality finished meals in their restaurants, hotels, cafeterias etc. As luck would have it, the US government had mandated stricter nutritional standards for school lunches in 1962. This policy shift created a huge demand from the national school lunch program for portion control meat items. In addition, institutional customers were ordering more heat and server frozen food products. To meet the rapid growth, the Martens expanded Fred's Frozen Foods product line to 40 items including breaded frozen vegetables, frozen ethnic entrees, frozen pre-portioned meats and frozen breaded meats. In addition, the Marten added a second manufacturing facility in Carthage, Missouri, increased the distribution network to cover 29 states and increased sales to $6 million in 1970. The Martens sold Fred's Frozen Foods to Central Soya in 1970 for an undisclosed amount. Central Soya Purchases Fred's Frozen Foods Central Soya, based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a leading soybean miller and food processor purchased Fred's Frozen Foods from the Marten Family in August 1970. Central Soya exchanged 150,000 shares of stock for all Fred's Frozen Foods assets, brands, operating equipment, personnel and $7 million outstanding debt. The transaction was accounted for as pooling of interest, which valued Fred's Frozen Foods at about $10 million.

The negative-acknowledgement (NAK or NACK) signal is sent to reject a previously received message or to indicate some kind of error. Acknowledgements and negative acknowledgements inform a sender of the receiver's state so that it can adjust its own state accordingly. Oftentimes, data messages in telecommunications contain checksums to verify the integrity of the payload and header. Checksums work in such a way that if a single bit of the data is corrupted, the checksum would have a different value, so they can provide an inexpensive way to check for (probable) signal integrity. If a message is received with an invalid checksum (that is, the data received would have a different checksum than the message had), the receiver can know that some information was corrupted. Most often, when checksums are employed, a corrupted message received will either not be served an ACK signal, or will be served a NAK signal. Acknowledgement characters ASCII code includes an ACK character (00001102 or 616) which can be transmitted to indicate successful receipt and a NAK character (00101012 or 1516) which can be transmitted to indicate an inability or failure to receive. Unicode provides visible symbols for these characters, U+2406 (‚êÜ) and U+2415 (‚êï). Protocol usage Many protocols are acknowledgement-based, meaning that they positively acknowledge receipt of messages. The internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an example of an acknowledgement-based protocol. When computers communicate via TCP, received packets are acknowledged by sending back a packet with an ACK bit set. The TCP protocol allows these acknowledgements to be included with data that is sent in the opposite direction. Some protocols send a single acknowledgement per packet of information. Other protocols such as TCP and ZMODEM allow many packets to be transmitted before receiving acknowledgement for any of them, a procedure necessary to fill high bandwidth-delay product links with a large number of bytes in flight. Other protocols are NAK-based, meaning that they only respond to messages if there is a problem. Examples include most reliable multicast protocols which send a NAK when the receiver detects missing packets. Still other protocols make use of both NAKs and ACKs. Binary Synchronous Communications (Bisync) and Adaptive Link Rate (for Energy- Efficient Ethernet) are examples. Still other protocols such as the RC-5, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and X10 protocols perform blind transmission with no acknowledgement, often transmitting the same message multiple times in hopes that at least one copy of the message gets through. The acknowledgement function is used in the automatic repeat request (ARQ) function. Acknowledgement frames are numbered in coordination with the frames that have been received and then sent to the transmitter. This allows the transmitter to avoid overflow or underrun at the receiver, and to become aware of any missed frames. In Binary Synchronous Communications, the NAK is used to indicate that a transmission error was detected in the previously received block and that the receiver is ready to accept retransmission of that block. Bisync does not use a single ACK character but has two control sequences for alternate even/odd block acknowledgement.  Hardware acknowledgement  Some computer buses have a dedicated acknowledge wire in the control bus used to acknowledge bus operations: DACK used for ISA DMA; DATACK used in the STEbus, the data transfer acknowledge pin of the Motorola 68000 that inspired the title of DTACK Grounded, etc. Some computer buses do not always acknowledge every write; some or all of the writes use a posted write. The I¬≤C serial bus has a time slot for an acknowledgment bit after each byte.

Journal of Computational Chemistry Jobs can be run online on the NUPACK webserver or NUPACK source code can be downloaded and compiled locally for non-commercial academic use.downloads NUPACK algorithms are formulated in terms of nucleic acid secondary structure. In most cases, pseudoknots are excluded from the structural ensemble.  Secondary structure model  An example secondary structure drawing (left) and the corresponding polymer graph (right). Backbones are represented by thick colored lines and bases and base pairs are represented by thin black lines. The secondary structure of multiple interacting strands is defined by a list of base pairs.Dirks, R.M., J.S. Bois, J.M. Schaeffer, E. Winfree, and N.A. Pierce, Thermodynamic analysis of interacting nucleic acid strands SIAM Review, 2007. 49(1): p. 65-88. A polymer graph for a secondary structure can be constructed by ordering the strands around a circle, drawing the backbones in succession from 5‚Äô to 3‚Äô around the circumference with a nick between each strand, and drawing straight lines connecting paired bases. A secondary structure is pseudoknotted if every strand ordering corresponds to a polymer graph with crossing lines. A secondary structure is connected if no subset of the strands is free of the others. Algorithms are formulated in terms of ordered complexes, each corresponding to the structural ensemble of all connected polymer graphs with no crossing lines for a particular ordering of a set of strands. The free energy of an unpseudoknotted secondary structure is calculated using nearest- neighbor empirical parameters for RNA in 1M Na+Serra, M.J. and D.H.

Pierce, An algorithm for computing nucleic acid base-pairing probabilities including pseudoknots. Journal of Computational Chemistry, 2004. 25: p. 1295-1304.  Web server = Analysis  The Analysis page allows users to analyze the thermodynamic properties of a dilute solution of interacting nucleic acid strands in the absence of pseudoknots (e.g., a test tube of DNA or RNA strand species). For a dilute solution containing multiple strand species interacting to form multiple species of ordered complexes, NUPACK calculates for each ordered complex: * the partition function, * the minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure, * the equilibrium base-pairing probabilities, * its equilibrium concentration, including rigorous treatment of distinguishability issues that arise in the multi-stranded setting.  Design  The Design page allows users to design sequences for one or more strands intended to adopt an unpseudoknotted target secondary structure at equilibrium. Sequence design is formulated as an optimization problem with the goal of reducing the ensemble defect below a user-specified stop condition.Zadeh, J.N., B.R. Wolfe, and N.A. Pierce, Nucleic acid sequence design via efficient ensemble defect optimization. Journal of Computational Chemistry. For a candidate sequence and a given target secondary structure, the ensemble defect is the average number of incorrectly paired over the structural ensemble of the ordered complex.Dirks, R.M., M. Lin, E. Winfree, and N.A. Pierce, Paradigms for computational nucleic acid design. Nucleic Acids Research, 2004. 32(4): p. 1392-1403. For a target secondary structure with N nucleotides, the algorithm seeks to achieve an ensemble defect below N/100. Empirically, the design algorithm exhibits asymptotic optimality as N increases: for sufficiently large N, the cost of sequence design is typically only 4/3 the cost of a single evaluation of the ensemble defect.  Utilities  The Utilities page allows users to evaluate, display, and annotate the equilibrium properties of a complex of interacting nucleic acid strands. The page accepts as input either sequence information, structure information, or both, performing diverse functions based on the information provided, including automatic layout and rendering of secondary structures with or without ideal helical geometry. In either case, the structure layout can be edited dynamically within the web application. The Utilities page enables depicting secondary structures with ideal helical geometry for stacked base pairs, as for this complex of three RNA strands with A-form helices (left) or three DNA strands with B-form helices (right).  Implementation  The NUPACK web application is programmed within the Ruby on Rails framework, employing Ajax and the Dojo Toolkit to implement dynamic features and interactive graphics. Plots and graphics are generated using NumPy and matplotlib. The site is supported on current versions of the web browsers Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. The NUPACK library of analysis and design algorithms is written in the programming language C. Dynamic programs are parallelized using Message Passing Interface (MPI).

Architecture  Storwize V7000 provides a very similar architecture to SVC, using the RAID code from the DS8000 to provide internal managed disks and SSD code from the DS8000 for tiered storage.  Features and software  All Storwize systems offer the following features: * Command line interface * Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use (CLI commands can be displayed as details), with (nearly) all functions available * Thin Provisioning known as Space Efficient Volumes * Volumes can be resized, i.e. expanded or reduced (only advisable, if supported by the operating system) * RAID levels 0,1,5,6,10 * Distributed RAID (DRAID), i.e. DRAID-5 and DRAID-6 * FlashCopy provides Snapshots with several combinations of these attributes: multiple, incremental, independent, space-efficient, immediately writable, or cascaded * Data Migration: data can be moved between all virtualized storage (both internal and external) with no disruption * Performance Management using throttling of bandwidth and transactions either by host or by volume * supports interactive and non-interactive ssh-login * supports several ways of call home and notifications (e-mail, syslog, SNMP, VPN-to-IBM, gui-based) * security functions, e.g. audit log, encrypted access In addition, other Storwize systems offer the following features (some of them may require licenses): * Automated tiered storage known as EasyTier, which supports hot spot removal within a tier (intra-tier) and between tiers (inter-tier) * Encryption for data at rest (all available original drives are self encrypting) * Peer to Peer Remote Copy * Metro Mirror (synchronous copy) * Global Mirror (asynchronous copy) * Global Mirror with Change Volumes (checkpointed asynchronous copy using flashcopies, e.g. for low bandwidth) * External Storage Virtualization * Virtual Disk Mirroring * Real-time Compression * Data Reduction Pools with Deduplication and Real-time Compression * Clustering, i.e. single user interface for several (up to 8) controllers, while supporting volume moves between them without disruption * Stretched cluster configuration (SVC only), optional \\"enhanced\\" version with site awareness (hardware redundancy only across sites) * Hyperswap (automated storage failover using the standard multipathing drivers; hardware redundancy on either site is given) In addition, the Storwize V7000 Unified offered the following features:. * File level storage (NAS) * Policy based file placement Active Cloud Engine * Global Namespace * Async replication on File level  Limitations  Most Storwize systems are intended for certain environments and provide several features, that are not licensed by default. There are several types of licenses that depend on the chosen model and the subject of the license: * licenses per net capacity (mainly with the SVC, where tiers can be treated differently) * licenses per enclosures (the controller and each expansion need one) * licenses per controller (just one license for all attached enclosures) There are some limitations for each model and each licensed internal code. These can be read on IBMs web pages. Here are examples for V7000, the V5000 series, and IBM SAN Volume Controller. In addition, there are more contributors to a working environment. IBM provides this in an interactive interoperabitlity matrix called IBM System Storage Interoperation Center (SSIC).  Timeline  According to the official availability dates and the days the systems are removed from marketing you can determine the following availability to purchase shown in light green. The graphics only contains the IBM storage systems starting with 'V', .i.e. V3700, V5000, V5010(E), V5020, V5030(E), V5100 and V7000.

It was a convent until it became the subject of a Vatican investigation in the 19th century, when it was disbanded and repurposed as a missionary college and later an abbey church. It is said to have been associated with Saint Ambrose.Rome, ancient and modern: and its environs, Volume 2 by Jeremiah Donovan 2010 pages 179-180 Etymology The name of the church derives from the tradition that the church was built on the site of the house in which Saint Ambrose lived in Rome, before he moved to become the bishop of Milan. The name \\"Massima\\" may derive from the Cloaca Maxima, a branch of which flows nearby, or from another church property, or from a claimed foundress of the church. History Sant'Ambrogio della Massima arose from the merger of two previous churches on the site in about 1500: one dedicated to Saint Mary, and a second to Saint Stephen. According to legend, the convent of Saint Mary was founded by Saint Marcellina, the older sister of Saint Ambrose, in 353. It was rebuilt in the 8th century and again in the 12th century; the church of Saint Stephen was also rebuilt in the early 12th century. The new building that united the two was dedicated to Saint Ambrose under the Benedictines and was gradually extended over time. Giacomo della Porta added a new wing in 1578. In 1606, Carlo Maderno redesigned the church under the orders of a nun, Beatrice Torres, and her brother Ludovico Torres. The church was abandoned during the Napoleonic Wars, but was restored under Pope Pius VII beginning in 1814. During this period the convent was inhabited by the Franciscans as an enclosed, women-only convent.Wolf, Hubert: Die Nonnen von Sant'Ambrogio (2013), pp. 105-113 The founding abbess of the restored convent, Maria Agnese Firrao, was convicted in 1816 of \\"false sanctity\\", or pretending to be a saint, and was removed from her post and imprisoned. Despite this, she continued to direct activities at the convent via smuggled correspondence with followers there.Wolf, Hubert: Die Nonnen von Sant'Ambrogio (2013), pp. 120-123; pp. 140-142 In 1859, Princess Katharina of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg- Schillingsf√ºrst, who had recently joined the convent as a novice, denounced its activities to an inquisition, accusing mistress of novices Maria Luisa, among others, of \\"sexual transgressions, heretical practices and homicidal schemes\\".Wolf, Hubert: Die Nonnen von Sant'Ambrogio (2013), pp. 38-56 Katharina noted the veneration of Firrao as well as Maria Luisa herself; the latter claimed to receive messages from St. Mary, was performing rituals usually allowed only for priests, and slept with several of the novices. Other transgressions included incorporating kissing and other sexual actions into the ritual of laying on of hands, and alleged affairs between the women and priests. According to Katharina, when she challenged convent practices, she became the victim of an attempted poisoning. As the investigation proceeded the Vatican removed the sisters from the convent and sent Maria Luisa into \\"forced isolation\\", but details of events at the convent were kept private by church authorities. It had emerged that the jesuit priest who as the \\"spiritual father\\" of the nuns had been entitled to hear confession in the convent and administer the sacrament of Penance had entered into sexual relations with Maria Luisa. Styling himself Giuseppe Peters, his real name was Joseph Kleutgen, an influential German theologian. The degree to which he had instigated the attempted poisoning of Katharina could not be ascertained. He was convicted as an heretic for his fostering of the cult of Agnese Firrao and sentenced to three years of emprisonment. However Pope Pius IX reduced the sentence to two years, which Kleutgen spent in a jesuit house of recreation, allowing him to finish his theological magnum opus. Later Kleutgen was instrumental in the drafting of the dogma of papal infallibility. Several high-ranking ecclesiastics as e.g. Cardinal Karl-August von Reisach and Peter Jan Beckx, Superior-General of the Society of Jesus, had been involved in the cult of Agnese Firrao and had put faith in Maria Luisa's supposed letters from the virgin Mary, so they took an interest in keeping the scandal from public view. The full details of the affair only became known after the opening of the archives of the Roman Inquisition in 1998, where the process files were discovered by Hubert Wolf. In 1861 Pope Pius IX gave the building to a group of Benedictine monks; they adopted it for a missionary college and replaced its fa√ßade when it collapsed the following year. The college was disbanded in 1883. The church is currently an abbey and the curial house of the Subiaco Cassinese Congregation. Architecture The current building, parts of which date to the 17th century, is a domed basilica. It is cross-shaped, with a chapel to either side of the nave. The church includes \\"rich gold stucco decorations and frescos depicting the life of Mary\\".  Relics  In the church deposited are the relics of St Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna.

Graduating from Cambridge University, Posford planned a law career but the successful interpolation in an early 1930s touring version of Lavender of a song he had written with Rodney Hobson prompted him towards a new career. After studying at the Royal College of Music, Posford composed many songs, often with librettist-lyricist Eric Maschwitz. For radio, they wrote Goodnight Vienna, which then became a 1932 film, starring Anna Neagle and Jack Buchanan (US title: Magic Night), and a stage show. Posford and Maschwitz then wrote The Great Hussar (1933), which, revised and with additional music by Bernard Grun, opened at London‚Äôs Adelphi Theatre as Balalaika (1936) where it ran for 570 performances. The hit song, hastily written by Posford and Maschwitz, was \\"At The Balalaika\\". The 1939 film version starred Nelson Eddy and Ilona Massey. Maschwitz, Posford and Grun also composed Paprika (1938), which flopped, but a revised version, Magyar Melody, ran at His Majesty‚Äôs Theatre for 105 performances. To the original score was added \\"Mine Alone\\", composed by Manning Sherwin, which outlived the show. Posford and Harry Parr-Davies composed Full Swing (1940), starring Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert, which had 468 performances during the London blitz. After the war, Posford co-composed Evangeline (1946) with Harry Jacobson. Starring Frances Day, this was a reworking by Maschwitz of James Laver‚Äôs Nymph Errant. In 1951, Posford was again in collaboration with Maschwitz, writing Zip Goes a Million. Starring George Formby, the show ran for 544 performances at the Palace Theatre and the songs included the title song, \\"Ridin‚Äô Into Town\\", \\"The Thing About You\\", \\"It Takes No Time To Fall In Love\\", \\"Nothing Breaks But The Heart\\", \\"I Owe You\\", \\"Big Business\\", \\"Trouble With My Heart\\", \\"Thou Art For Me\\", \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"I‚Äôm Saving Up For Sally\\". Posford and Maschwitz also collaborated on Happy Holiday (1954), a musical version of Arnold Ridley‚Äôs The Ghost Train. Among the songs from this show was \\"Sew A Silver Button On the Moon\\". Staged over Christmas, the show was another failure. Some of Posford‚Äôs melodies and themes appeared in the films The Good Companions and Britannia of Billingsgate (both 1933), and Invitation to the Waltz (1935).

The station is still in use, although few trains stop here nowadays. It has two platforms, the one by rail number one being long and wide and the one by rail number two being long and wide.  Etymology  Until 1947, the train station was called ƒåerven√Ω most (Red bridge in English). From 1947 to 1951 it was called Bratislava - ƒåerven√Ω most. In 1951 it received it current name Bratislava - ≈Ωelezn√° studienka. It is named after the area it is situated in - ≈Ωelezn√° studienka (Little iron well in English). The name comes from the fact, that in the past people thought the water source here was rich in iron and minerals, but 19th century analysis showed the water here is not mineral.http://bratislava.sme.sk/c/2355709/zeleznu-studienku-pomenovali-podla- pramena.html  History  Unique historical photograph, date unknown The original Red bridge was built in 1848 next to the place where the train station will once be, carrying only one rail track on the Wien ‚Äì G√§nserndorf ‚Äì Bratislava line, which was launched on August 20, 1848. The bridge crossed the valley over river Vydrica. In 1891, the line between Bratislava main railway station and Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves was converted to 2 parallel rail tracks and the Red bridge was rebuilt.

Soon after the coronation of his father, he was crowned co-emperor and renamed Constantine (ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ, K≈çnstant√Ænos). He reigned nominally along with his father until the latter's deposition in 820, after which he was exiled to Prote, one of the Princes Islands, as a monk. Biography Symbatios was the eldest son of the emperor Leo V the Armenian () and his wife, Theodosia. His father was an Armenian commander in Byzantine service, possibly descended from the Gnuni family. He had risen to high command as a prot√©g√© of Bardanes Tourkos, but deserted him when the latter rebelled against Nikephoros I (). His mother was also of Armenian origin, the daughter of the patrikios Arsaber who attempted an unsuccessful usurpation against Nikephoros I in 808. As he was a child at the time of his father's accession to the throne, Symbatios was born sometime between 800 and 810. Michael I Rhangabes (), the son-in-law and successor of Nikephoros I, was likely the boy's godfather.. At the head of a military revolt following the disastrous Battle of Versinikia against the Bulgars, Leo deposed Michael I on 11 July 813 and was crowned emperor on the next day. Some time after he had Symbatios crowned co-emperor and renamed Constantine. The latter name was not chosen randomly: aside from it being a traditional Byzantine imperial name dating back to Constantine the Great, the assembled troops now publicly acclaimed the emperors \\"Leo and Constantine\\", evoking openly the iconoclast emperor Leo III the Isaurian () and his son Constantine V (). Although prior to his accession Leo had given written guarantees to the iconophile patriarch Nikephoros I that he would not attempt to overthrow iconophile church doctrine, the naming of the new co-emperor was a clear statement of intent to the contrary. Leo's motivations can only be guessed at, but at a time when the environs of Constantinople itself were being raided by the Bulgar ruler Krum, the military successes achieved by the iconoclast emperors contrasted starkly with the defeats suffered by the recent iconophile regimes. Leo was also a military man, and the memory of the iconoclast emperors was particularly cherished by the army, where many still adhered to iconoclasm. On 14 March 814, Leo forced the resignation of Patriarch Nikephoros I, and appointed the pro-iconoclast Theodotos Melissenos, the son of one of Constantine V's brothers-in-law, in his place. The new patriarch convened a Church council in Constantinople, which overturned the Second Council of Nicaea and reinstated the ban on the veneration of icons. The council was presided over by Theodotos, while Constantine attended it as his father's representative. In 819/820, he issued, jointly with his father, a novel on marriage law. Leo the Armenian was assassinated on 25 December 820 by the supporters of Michael the Amorian, who had been imprisoned for conspiring against Leo. Michael was released from prison and proclaimed emperor on the same night. The new emperor banished Constantine, along with his mother and three brothers, Basil, Gregory, and Theodosios, to the island of Prote, one of the Princes Islands in the Sea of Marmara. There, the four brothers were castrated to make them incapable of claiming the throne in the future, and tonsured. They spent the rest of their days there as monks, although Michael the Amorian allowed them to keep part of the proceeds from their confiscated estates for their and their servants' upkeep. Basil and Gregory are still mentioned as iconophiles in 847, but nothing further is known of Constantine.

Mangkunegara II was the king in Mangkunegaran who succeeded to the throne of his grandfather, Mangkunegara I. His reign lasted from 1796 to 1835. Mangkunegara II was the son of Prince Hario Prabuwijaya, who was the son of Mangkunegara I.  Family  Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Adipati Aria came from a Prabuwijaya family, born to Queen Alit and Prince Sambernyawa. He was a grandson of both Pakubowono III and Mangkunegara I, maternally and paternally, respectively. This dynasty had a tradition of being strongly militaristic. He became king in Mangkunegaran, replacing his grandfather who had died in 1795. As king, he was called Mangkunegara II. As a youth in the care of his grandfather, Mangkunegara I had been prepared for the succession to the royal throne which had been diverted from his father Prince Hario Prabuwijaya. Boundary disputes with neighboring areas increased tensions which led to open warfare. With the experiences of his youth in the direct care of his grandfather, Mangkunegara II subsequently grew to become a leader in the legendary style of his grandfather.  Government  While Mangkunegara II was ruler in the Duchy of Mangkunegaran, his administration was preoccupied with war and territorial expansion. Mangkunegara's administration tended to be active and expansive. It played a role in dealing with the colonial power and relations with the other powers in Java.  Expanding the empire  During the reign of Mangkunegara II, Mangkunegaran expanded from 4,000 to 5,500 households. In the year 1808, the Legion Mangkunegaran was formed with 1,150 armed personnel to strengthen the position of Mangkunegaran. The use of the word \\"Legion\\" for the army reflects the Mangkunegaran absorption of new ideas from Europe through Daendels, who served as Governor-General in Dutch East Indies. Regions The Mangkunegaran administration consisted of regions which include Malangjiwan, Wonogiri and Karanganyar.  Mediate Conflict In Yogyakarta = Power situation beginning Java, 1800  Government Mangkunegara II experience success in reducing conflict in Yogyakarta as well as forming a new government in Yogyakarta that is with the Duchy Paku Alaman Kasultanan.

Yogyakarta was less ready in read-century changes involving foreign powers / Europe on the island of Java, which is different from VOC-performance Java Belanda. Terhadap Dutch ruling authorities could play a role as the conquests of the ruling power. Netherlands serving ruler of Java as a strategy to obtain the desired destination.

Mangkunegaran skilled and quickly read the changing times and respond immediately to partnering with the establishment of the Kingdom of the Armed Forces. Yogyakarta little late in reading the changes so accept the risk of deterioration of the Kingdom.  European powers in Java  In contrast to the Netherlands, European powers who came in 1800 the military as it has the coercive power of the same pembangkangan. Sama from Europe, the European powers who came was the Revolutionary forces, always ready to fight-fighter. In the Sultan's Palace fragmented situation in the group broke down the strength of each one with a lainnya.

One more is the group that because of his position Patih Danurejo a compromise between the Sultan and the Governor Netherlands then requires a governor to serve two interests of rulers; Sultanate and the Governor of the Netherlands. The conflict between groups that invite the government in Batavia fell into the area with his army.  European Intervention in Java  In the two periods of the Governor-General (Daendels and Raffles), Yogyakarta suppressed with military force to compel Hamengkubuwono II down the throne. Di December 1810 Daendels with troops 4200 soldiers stormed Yogyakarta. Daendels reduce Hamengkubuwono II and then raised the son of the Crown of Yogyakarta as Hamengkubuwono III and returned to Batavia with the Prince Natakusuma as Tawana.

At the same time- Sepehi Gurkha Soldiers who came to Java with the British plan involved a rebellion against British rule because of circulating rumors that they will be sold to the Netherlands and the abandoned England so as to enlarge the number of troops hit Yogyakarta then Raffles contacting their Prince Prangwadana of Mangkunegaran to exert Legion Mangkunegaran back up troops Natakusuma. The strength of Europe who came to Java is the force that can compel because it comes with a very memadai.

Compromise is the perfect solution because there is no accuracy to get rid of Hamengkubuwono III and replace it with Prince Natakusuma and also there is no accuracy to maintain Hamengkubuwono III to get rid of Prince Natakusuma. Examples from the past who managed to defuse conflicts that go on are the division of power. March 17, 1813, Yogyakarta, split into two powers. Along with the division (still, time Raffles Mangkunegaran get an extra entry in his control area.

From this, a culture of literary criticism emerged among Arab women, and under the Umayyad dynasty, Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn established the first literary salon in her home.Khaldi, 2008, p. 58 The tradition was revived during the late nineteenth century, as a result of sweeping social, political and economic change within the Ottoman Empire and Europe's increasing political and cultural influence in the region. The initial pioneers of the Arab salon were women from wealthy families in Greater Syria and Egypt, who returned influenced by interaction with European women during their time spent studying abroad and frequenting Parisian salons, or studying in schools run by European or American missionaries. The salon evenings, run by women but attended by both men and women, provided a unique opportunity to have discussions about social, political and literary trends of the day. Though the tradition died out somewhat after the Second World War, it has left a lasting legacy on literary culture and women's issues throughout the Arab world. Indeed, more than one hundred years later, the UN Arab Human Development Report echoes what many people in Arab societies were coming to realise at that time: \\"An Arab Renaissance cannot be accomplished without the rise of women in Arab countries.\\" Background to the nineteenth-century literary societies=Women and education The educational reforms of the nineteenth century, a period of sweeping social, economic and political transition, resulted from various undercurrents occurring at different levels within the realms of the Ottoman Empire from the Mashreq (Greater Syria) to the Maghreb (North Africa). These trends were largely attributable to the increased European presence in the region and their secular ideas of modernity. At a societal level, the arrival of Christian missionaries supported by the European and American governments led to the creation of a formal system of education for girls, who had until this period received little or no education. Initially, this took the form of private institutions attracting wealthy and mostly Christian families. However, as these schools became more socially acceptable and affordable, the idea trickled down to the middle classes before finally reaching out to the poor. Thus, a new norm was becoming increasingly prevalent; the idea that girls should receive an education so as to afford them better marriage prospects, and more importantly, to provide them with adequate means in which to educate their children.Lattouf, 2004, pp. 62-63 At this point in time, the range of subjects offered to women was limited. However women seized these opportunities to learn, and showed admirable drive and determination. By the middle of the century, a sense of \\"...awareness and obligation for intellectual and social consciousness, especially the appreciation of women's plight, and the struggle for a voice in society became visible and public.\\"Lattouf, 2004, p. 67 A notable example of the contribution of Western missionaries to increasing educational opportunities for women was the work of Daniel and Abby Maria Bliss, an American couple who moved to Beirut in 1866 and subsequently set up the Syrian Protestant College (which later became the American University of Beirut). In 1905, a nursing programme that accepted applications from women was established, and in 1924, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences opened its doors to female students.Lattouf, 2004, p. 70 The rumblings of reform taking place within Ottoman society reached the Sultanate, and were eventually echoed at an institutional level. The Ottoman regime, in order to counteract the threat of political and religious influence from the Christian missionary schools and due to the realisation that the empire could not hope to survive without learning the modern natural sciences, began to implement its own reforms (tanzimat). According to the Arab historian, Eugene Rogan, the reforms introduced by the Sultanate had little effect on the subjects of the empire. However, by the 1850s and 1860s, the fruits of reform were visible in the daily life.Rogan, 2009, p. 90 The third (and arguably the most important) current that led to the existence and improvement of women's education in the nineteenth and early twentieth century was due to European colonialism and its legacy. Napoleon's short-lived occupation of Egypt (1798‚Äì1801) was relatively unsuccessful by French standards. However, their revolutionary ideas and imports in the field of technology and education were to prove more durable in Egypt and the rest of North Africa.Rogan, 2009, pp. 61-64 Under the leadership of Muhammad 'Ali, an admirer of French innovation and technology, interactions and exchanges between Egypt and France in the cultural, academic and scientific fields increased during his reignRogan, 2009, \\"The Egyptian Empire of Muhammad 'Ali\\", pp. 61-83 Indeed, it was not just male students who spent time abroad. Notable Arab hostesses or salonni√®res such as Mayy Ziyadah spent time in France, and the Egyptian feminist and occasional hostess of salon evenings, Huda Sha\`arawi, used to grant scholarships to writers enabling them to study in Europe at her own expense.Zeidan, 1995, pp. 50-53 Ideas of educational reform and feminism were also occurring elsewhere in the Arab world, with the Syrian writer and scholar, Butrus al-Bustani (1819‚Äì1883) in Lebanon among the first to advocate women‚Äôs right to education in 1847.AUC Critical Reference Guide. American University in Cairo Press, 2008 p. 6 Two decades later in Tunisia, the reformist, Ahmed Kheireddine, stressed the importance of women's education in the running of households and raising children. This was a small, but crucial step in the emancipation of women in society. Later in Egypt, after the British took over from the French in their 'civilising mission'Cromer, 1908, p. 124 of Egypt they also contributed to the reform of women's education. In his work entitled, Modern Egypt, Lord Cromer, who had served for almost thirty years as High Commissioner of Egypt, \\"...by confining the sphere of women's interest to a very limited horizon, cramps the intellect and withers the mental development of one-half of the population in Moslem countries.\\"Cromer, 1908, pp. 155-156. The European powers at that time aimed to establish an Arab elite class that supports their colonization policies in the Arab World. Therefore, education was made more accessible for those who were ready to detach from their cultural roots and embrace that of the colonial powers. This strategy was common in almost all the places that colonialism existed. Arab people still hold the perception that their leaders, whose families gained power from that time, are puppets to the western powers and that feeling may have stemmed from that period of time. Therefore, many Arabs believe that colonialism had a very bad effect on the political, cultural, social, and economic life of the vast majority of the Arab people. By 1924, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the American University of Beirut began accepting applications from women, the norm that \\"Knowledge rather than ignorance preserves women's dignity and morality\\" had been firmly established. In the face of confinement and exclusion from the formal education system, middle-class women overcame their exclusion and marginalisation from society, holding informal literary or study circles in their family homes.Lattouf, 2004, p. 51 Moreover, women such as Mayy Ziyadah and Mary 'Ajami went on to pursue higher education in Europe, returning to set up well-known salons and contributing immeasurably to literary circles, print and production in the Arab world. Women and the public sphere At the turn of the nineteenth century, the idea of the harem continued to linger in many Arab societies. Women of the urban middle and upper classes were confined to the domestic sphere, and the vast majority remained unseen and unheard in public life. Necessity afforded female members of the lower and rural classes slightly more 'freedom', as they were needed to work the land in order to support their families. Women's issues began to emerge from the background - albeit slowly - in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with the likes of QƒÅsim Amin (1863‚Äì1908)'Imarah, Muhammad \\"QƒÅsim Amin wa-tahrir al- mar'ah\\". al-Mu'assasah alArabiyyah lil-Dirasat wa-al-Nashr, 1980 calling the seclusion of women an 'injustice' and advocating partial empowerment of women. However, the majority of prominent feminist writers were men, and the presence of women activists in the public sphere was virtually non-existent. The salon and its male participants, many of whom were well-known intellectuals, provided them with a means in which to express their ideas and opinions in private, whilst accessing the male-dominant public sphere through their lively discussions and debates.Zeidan, 1995, p. 44 In her thesis entitled 'Arab Women Going Public: Mayy Ziyadah and her Literary Salon in a Comparative Context', Boutheina Khaldi remarks that women of the salons overcame the obstacle of gender inequality \\"by bringing public men into their private salons and hence creating a public sphere from the very heart of the private one.\\"Khaldi, 2008, p. 62 The essays and letters produced by hostesses and participants of the salons on the topics discussed also had a considerable impact on society at the time, and in particular, the nurturing of the Arab Renaissance and women's emancipation. The publication of letters by is interpreted by J√ºrgen Habermas in his writing on the public sphere as bridging the gap between the private sphere in which women gathered, and the public sphere that they sought to shape and conquer. Women and the Arab cultural renaissance The Arab Renaissance (al-Nahda or ) was an endeavour to reach a compromise between contemporary practices similar to those in Europe and a shared Arab heritage, in the hope of shaping a new vision for an Arab society in transition. The relationship between women's literary salons and the Arab Awakening, as it was also referred to, is of paramount importance. Not only were meetings of literary figures an integral part of the Renaissance, but from the beginning of the Arab Renaissance in the nineteenth century, women came to realise the strong bonds between the literary-cultural, social and political, and that the literary movement was key to liberating the 'collective consciousness' from the traditional norms that had stunted their progress. Men also began to acknowledge the importance of women's emancipation to national liberation and development at this time,Ashour et al., 2008, p. 14 and there is no doubt that increased interactions between male and female intellectuals within literary circles made an invaluable contribution. One of the first men to write about the liberation of women was QƒÅsim Amin, an influential literary figure at the turn of the twentieth century, argued for the emancipation of women for the sake of the Arab Renaissance, as did al-Tahtawi. Both of these men frequented Mayy Ziyadah's salon in Cairo. Thus women's desire for emancipation and men's nationalist dreams became the keystone in the advancement of society. In 1847, two great literary figures of the Arab cultural renaissance, Butrus Al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji, founded the first literary society, Jam'iyyat al-Adab wal-'Ulum (The Literary and Scientific Society). Its members were exclusively Syrian Christians and Europeans living and working in diplomatic and missionary circles. However, ten years later, al-Jam'iyya al-'Ilmiyya al- Suriyya (The Syrian Scientific Society) was established, and attracted Western-educated Muslims and Druze as well as Christians. In 1917, the Tunisian literary figure, Hassan Hosni Abdel-Wahab wrote about the urgent need for educated Muslim young women to take charge of the future and to 'awaken the nationalist spirit', as without this, 'life would turn to nihilism and its consequences'. Only a few years later in the 1920s, Manwia Al-Wartani and Habiba al-Minshari, became the leaders of a dynamic women's movement in Tunisia. Like these Tunisian pioneers, women of the upper and middle classes across the increasingly imagined Arab world began to reap the benefits of education, and many of them began to focus on writing and joined their male counterparts in contributing to the Arab Renaissance.. & Cooke, Miriam. Eds. \\"\\",, p. One woman of particular significance to the awareness of the Arab Renaissance amongst women was Princess NƒÅzƒ´l Fadƒ´l (c.1884-1914). Her salon seems to have had an effect on its male guests, who were usually prominent members of the nationalist cause.Khaldi, 2008, p. 47 The tradition of women's printing and press, an integral part of middle-class circlesBadran, 1996, p. 61 and the Renaissance, was also intertwined with the literary salon. Many hostesses produced letters and essays on issues discussed in salons, such as equality, women's rights and nationalism. In Palestine, for example, the press became a partisan for the women, who used it as a transmitter and a publicist for their activities. The Lebanese journalist, Hind Nawfal published the first monthly journal, al-Fatah in 1892 in Egypt, encouraging women to think of journalism as a respectable occupation.Zeidan, 1995, pp. 46, 49 Other journals, many published by Lebanese women in Egypt, followed suit: Anis al- Jalis, al-'A'ilah, al-Mar'ah, al-Zahrah, Fatat al-Sharq, al-A'mal al- Yadawiyyah and al-'Arous (The Bride) which was published by Mary 'Ajami. It is worth noting that this publication did not focus solely on women's issues, but also those related to the Renaissance and nationalism. Whilst the environment in which these female literary figures were operating in was becoming more and more conducive to women's issues, the road to equality and liberation was by no means free from obstacles, and many women published articles under pseudonyms. The salon=Terminology The French word, salon, which was first uttered in seventeenth century France comes from the Italian word sala; and was used to define a large reception hall or reception room in a private residence. Later, it was used when referring to social gatherings in nineteenth century France. The word found its way to Egypt with the Napoleonic expedition, and was one of many traces of the French-Egyptian encounter (1798-1801) and its legacy.Khaldi, 2008, p. 56 Whilst the word salon itself was a European import, there were various words in Arabic that were used to describe various kinds of social gatherings in the Arab world. According to the academic and expert, Boutheina Khaldi, the terms nadwah or nadi or muntada \\"...were used traditionally to indicate the call on people to gather for a purpose.\\" The word majlis, however, such as the majlis of the first hostess of an Arab salon - Sukaynah bint al-Husayn - has the specific meaning of assembly, a gathering that might have a more regular or permanent nature in terms of time and place.\\"Khaldi, 2008, p. 57 Khaldi goes on to say that the frequenters of the more modern Arab salons were obviously aware of these, and often used both the French and the Arab words to refer to the gatherings, implying the synthesis of both Arab and European influences in the salon culture.Khaldi, 2008, p. 59 The first salon The history of the literary salon in the Arab world, of which little is known, dates back far longer than one would expect. Sukayna bint Husayn (735 / 743), began running her salon centuries during the Umayyad dynasty, well before the idea was first introduced to seventeenth century Europe. She was a highly regarded woman of great intelligence, and an expert in fashion and literature. She was the first woman to open her house to male and female guests, and organised evenings of music, literary criticism and poetry.Khaldi, 2008, p. 92 European influences Many of the Arab women who founded literary salons received at least part of their education in Europe or in European missionary schools, and were thus exposed to certain aspects of European culture, including the salon tradition. In this regard, the great impact of the colonial powers and the imposition of their culture and values on the region cannot be underestimated. However, that is by no means to say that the Arab women's literary salon was a passive imitation or export of European ideas. Rather, those men and women who travelled to Europe or who were well-read in European literature selected elements of the European tradition and fused them with the traditional Arab salons of old, which was typical of the Arab Renaissance. Moreover, in 1890, one of the French salonni√®res, Eug√©nie Le Brun, chose to hold a salon evening in Cairo in an effort to learn more about women's circles in Egypt, and to encourage the revival of the tradition.Khaldi, 2008, p. 45 One of the salons said to have had an influence is Madame de Rambouillet's salon, which opened in 1618 and was held at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet in Paris. It was the first and most famous salon in French history. Rambouillet made sure to distinguish her salon from an Academy, and emphasised entertainment as well as enlightenment. Like the later literary salons in the Arab world, the gatherings bore witness to the mingling of the literary elite, with male intellectuals and middle-class women. In a similar fashion to the salons in Cairo, topics such as religion, philosophy and history would be discussed, but it is noted that Rambouillet \\"...made sure the treatment of the subject was not heavy-handed.\\" Mayy Ziyadah admired the French \\"salonni√®res\\", and made sure to write copious materials on the well-known French hostess, habitu√©e and prominent woman of aristocratic Parisian society, Madame de S√©vign√©, who was herself influenced by her time spent at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet. The great Egyptian nationalist and writer, TƒÅhƒÅ Husayn, who began attending Ziyadah's salon after she requested Ahmad Lutfi al-Sayyid bring him along on a Tuesday evening, comments on the fusion of Arab and European influences that created the salons of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: \\"Mayy revives by this salon a long-established Arab practice, just as she transfers to Egypt a long-established European practice, ancient and modern.\\"Quoted in Khaldi, 2008, p. 59 An evening spent in the salon Unlike salon sessions in England, which sometimes took place during the day or over several days the salons in cities such as Cairo, Jerusalem and Aleppo were usually held in the evening or at night in the family homes of salonni√®res.Khaldi, 2008 One of the less well-known salons in Beirut, for example, was convened on three consecutive full-moon nights each month, where male and female guests stayed awake until dawn, enjoying the entertainment and lively literary discussions. It was the norm for salonni√®res to invite participants, and with notable exceptions such as Mayy Ziyadah who invited guests from different social standings in order to give young writers the opportunity to show off their talents to a discerning audience,Zeidan, 1995, p. 54 the majority of salons were a space for male and female members of the educated middle class elite. Within the confines of the salon, the free-flow of conversation and reciprocity was encouraged, and a sense of equality was fostered.Khaldi, 2008, p. 74 The salon evenings were also regarded as arbiters of music and literature, as well as places were social and political ideas were aired and discussed, and where guests could embrace new trends and fashions exported from Europe. There was something unique about these salon sessions, according to the historian Keith Watenpaugh, who lends a description of a salon evening: \\"...soir√©es were unrelated men and women circulated with one another freely, and where Christians and Muslims, who shared a similar educational background, drank and smoked cigarettes‚Äîrather than sharing a nargileh (hookah pipe)‚Äîtogether while they sat in straight back chairs around high tables...\\" The tone and topics of discussion were usually at the discretion of the salonni√®res or hostesses, who administered the conversation. Of course, every salon was slightly different, but most evenings offered a mix of serious and lighthearted conversation, with musical entertainment in some cases. As the conversation flowed, it was not uncommon for guests to colour their conversations with personal anecdotes or local gossip. Indeed, it was thought to be a necessary talent of a successful hostess to encourage such digressions.Khaldi, 2008, p. 95 As these salons were conducted during the Arab Awakening, which advocated a synthesis of tradition and modernity, the use of fushƒÅ (classical Arabic) was emphasised.Khaldi, 2008, p. 85 Unfortunately, specific topics of conversation in the literary salons have remained somewhat of a mystery over the years. However, in Yatanaqashun (They Discuss), a fictional portrayal of a salon session held in her house in which the subject of 'equality' was discussed at length,Khaldi, 2008, p. 123 Mayy Ziyadah gives a good indication of the content, atmosphere and interactions between male and female participants in her salon. Antun Sha\`arawi also encapsulates the opulent evenings spent in a Syrian salon with his vivid description: \\"Wearing either all black or all white dresses ordered from Paris, Marrash hosted the mixed evening get-togethers in which literary topics as varied as the Mu'allaqat, a cycle of seven pre-Islamic poems or the work of Rabelais were discussed. Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and 'araq flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph.\\" Men who visited the salon A number of notable men, famous for their ideas and writing frequented the literary salons and contributed to the discussions. Some of them developed friendships with the female hostesses and asked them for their advice and opinions on their work. Among those who visited the salons was the advocate of women's rights and writer, QƒÅsim Amin; the Islamic reformists, al- ImƒÅm Muhammad 'Abduh and RifƒÅ'ah RƒÅfi' al-TahtƒÅwƒ´; leader of the Egyptian Wafd party, Sa'd Zaghlul; Lutfƒ´ al-Sayyid; the literary critic and journalist, 'Abbas Mahm≈©d al-'AqqƒÅd; the Syrian poet, Khalil MutrƒÅn; the journalist Muhammad Husayn Haykal; the poet Ahmad Shawqƒ´; the Egyptian Prime Minister Boutros GhƒÅlƒ´ and the Egyptian nationalist and writer, TƒÅhƒÅ Husayn. Several of these men published articles and books on women's rights; including RifƒÅ'ah RƒÅfi' al-TahtƒÅwiZeidan, 1995, p. 15 and QƒÅsim Amin, who is said to have found the inspiration for his seminal works, Tahrir al-Mar'ah (The Liberation of Women) and al-Mar'ah al-Jadidah (The New Woman) in Princess NƒÅzlƒ´ al-FƒÅdil's salon. Notable literary salons and societies=Marrash's Salon (Aleppo) Maryana Marrash's salon, the first salon in the nineteenth-century revival movement, was run from the house she shared with her husband in Aleppo. The habitual gathering offered a private realm in which male and female guests could mingle, network, and discuss the fashionable topics of the time. Marrash would often entertain her guests by singing and playing the piano. Regulars at the salon included prominent literary figures and politicians, such as Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi, Qustaki al-Himsi, Rizqallah Hassun, Kamil al-Ghazzi and Victor Khayyat. Princess NƒÅzlƒ´ FƒÅdil's Salon (Cairo) NƒÅzlƒ´ FƒÅdil was one of the first women to revive the tradition of the literary salon and contributed immeasurably to the cause of women's emancipation in the Arab world. She began to invite guests to her Cairo salon towards the end of the nineteenth century, although the absence of female participants in her salon evenings should be noted. Like Maryana Marrash, FƒÅdil added to the ambience in her salon by playing the piano, while one of her male guests sang and her Tunisian maid danced. The men who frequented her salon were prominent in Egyptian and Arab society; including statesmen, diplomats, journalists and literary figures.Ashour et al., 2008, p. 12 Among the regular visitors to her salon was the renowned Islamic Reformist thinker, Sheikh Mohammed 'Abduh, as well as QƒÅsim Amin, Boutros Ghali and Saad Zaghloul, to name but a few. The Dawn of Syria (Beirut) In 1880, the Lebanese writer Maryam Nimr Makariyus established the Dawn of Syria literary society in Beirut. The Association of the Arab Women Awakening (Beirut) This literary society was founded by Muslim women in Beirut in 1914. Katy Antonius' Salon (Jerusalem) Katy Antonius ran what has been described as 'the focal point of Jerusalem social life'Obituary for Katy Antonius, The Times, 8 December 1984. from the home she shared with her husband - the celebrated Arab nationalist, George Antonius - during the Mandate period. The salon provided local journalists, officials, officers, politicians and European diplomats with an opportunity to network and discuss the latest literary, social and political issues. Her parties have been described as 'elaborate affairs' with 'evening dress, Syrian food and drink, and dancing on the marble floor.' From time to time Antonius invited the boys from her orphanage to her salon evenings, as well as her array of famous guests. Mayy Ziyadah's Salon (Cairo) Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Mayy Ziyadah began to host well-known men and women from intellectual, literary and political circles across the Arab world. Meetings were held at her family home, the first salon in Cairo in which men and women met together in the same room.Badran, 1996, p. 56 In terms of etiquette, Ziyadah maintained a 'tactful correspondence' with guests of her salon, who were expected to inform her of their attendance through letters as a matter of courtesy. She and her guests also published letters they wrote from conversations in the salon.Khaldi, 2008, p. 3 A Syrian Christian journalist, Salim Sarkis, a typical representative of the educated middle class clientele who used to frequent the gatherings, attended Ziyadah's salon, which was held on Tuesday evenings for twenty-three years, 1913‚Äì1936. The influence of Ziyadah's time spent in the salons of France is obvious, with Sarkis comparing her to notable French \\"salonni√®res\\". The journalist gives the reader a rare insight into the atmosphere of the salon in the following description: The salon evenings ended after her mother's death in 1932, as social pressure would not permit an unmarried woman to enjoy the company of men without members of her family present.Khaldi, 2008 p. 103 A eulogy by Syrian poet Khalil Mutran mourned Ziyadah's death and the passing of her salon: Huda Sha'arawi's Salon (Cairo / Beirut) Sha\`arawi's salon only met sporadically, but was well-attended by many famous political figures and intellectuals; including Ahmad Shawqi, Gabriel TaqlƒÅ and Muhammad Husayn Haykal. She loved music, and would often play the piano long into the night whilst in her salon. Sha\`arawi used to award a literary prize every year, and would also encourage young writers from her salon by sending them to study in Europe at her own expense.Sha\`arawi, 1986, p. 63 The Women's Literary Club (Damascus) The Damascus Women's Literary Club was founded by Mary Ajami around 1920, and was aimed at strengthening the bonds between women. It held public meetings, giving its members a platform on which to air their views on literary and political issues.Zeidan, 1995, p. 45 Occasionally they discussed politics, but they were mainly interested in reviving classical Arabic literature and familiarising themselves with modern Western thought. According to Joseph T. Zeidan, those who frequented the salon were treated to the melodic tones of Mary‚Äôs sister‚Äôs piano playing, as well as the insightful and witty comments of Mary herself, who was \\".. highly praised for her ability to run the intellectual discourse and was acknowledged as a ‚Äòskilled talker‚Äô\\". Sukaynah's Salon (Damascus) Thurayya Al-Hafez, a school teacher and popular feminist,http://www.syrianhistory.com/thuraya-al-hafez launched a salon evening in her house in Damascus in 1953.Zeidan, 1995, p. 55 The salon was named after Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn, the first Arab woman to host a salon.Zeidan, 1995, p. 82 It was open to both men and women, though only the latter were in charge of running the proceedings. Its objectives included \\"...raising literary and artistic standards, creating strong bonds and cooperation among its members, publishing their works, translating Western literary works into Arabic, and translating Arabic literature into foreign languages. It continued to run until 1963, when its founder moved to Egypt. Pioneering women behind the salons * Maryana Marrash (1849-1919) was the first Arab woman in the nineteenth century to revive the tradition of the literary salon in the Arab world, with the salon she ran in her family home in Aleppo. * Zaynab FawwƒÅz (?1860-1914), who founded a salon in Damascus. * Princess Nazli Fadil (c.1884‚àí1914) * Huda Sha'arawi (1879‚Äì1947) became one of the most famous feminists in the Arab world. In 1914, she formed al-IttihƒÅd al-NisƒÅ'i al-Tahdhƒ©bƒ© (Women's Refinement Union), where Egyptian and European came together to discuss new ideas. This led to the establishment of the Jami'yyat al-Ruqiyy a;-Adabiyyah li al-SayyyidƒÅt al-MisriyyƒÅt (Egyptian Ladies Literary Improvement Society). In the 1920s, Sha\`arawi began to hold regular meetings for women at her home, and from this, the Egyptian Feminist Union was born. She launched a fortnightly journal, L'√âgyptienne in 1925, in order to publicise the cause.Khaldi, 2008, p. 40Zeidan, 1995, p. 34 * Mayy Ziyadah (1886‚àí1941) is the best known of the women associated with the literary salons, and was a leading figure in literary circles throughout the Arab world. * Mary 'Ajami (1888‚àí1965) founded the Damascus Women's Literary Club in 1920. * Katy Antonius (n√©e Nimr, d. 1984), born to Egyptian-Lebanese parents, experienced a privileged upbringing and education in Alexandria as the daughter of a prominent Egyptian publisher and landowner. In 1927, she married the intellectual and Arab nationalist, George Antonius. She was a fashionable socialite known for her wit, humour, kindness, and charm; as well as her infamous parties and salon evenings. As well as her salon, Antonius established a boys' orphanage in Old Jerusalem called Dar al-Awlad. * Thuraya Al-Hafez (1911-2000) 'launched her own literary and political salon in Damascus, which was open to both genders. The salon was convened in her own house and was named after Sukayna bint al-Hussein, the great-granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad, who presided over the first literary salon in Muslim history'.Ghada Talhami, Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa (Plymouth: Scarecrow, 2013). The salon was launched in 1953.Sami M. Moubayed, Steel and Silk: Men and Women who Shaped Syria 1900-2000 (Seattle: Cune Press, 2006), p. 435. Modern-day salons In the 1960s, women and their ideas started to become part of the mainstream culture, and thus the important role of women-run salons declined in its importance. That said, The Women's Literary Club, which was founded by Mary 'Ajami in 1922, continues to run in Damascus, and was attended regularly by the novelist Ulfat Idilbi until her death in 2007.Droubi, Hala. \\"Obituary for UlfƒÅt Idlibi\\" Forward Magazine, April 2007. Accessed on 11/24/2010. In 2010, a new weekly salon evening for young male and female writers and literary enthusiasts was launched in the basement of a hotel in Damascus. The popular event held on Monday evenings, named Bayt al-Qasid (House of Poetry), is an opportunity for new voices rather than established poets or writers, and attracts both Syrians and foreigners.Fahim, Kareem & Mahfoud, Nawara. \\"Evenings of Poetry Provide a Space for New Voices\\" New York Times, Damascus Journal, September 19, 2010.

Following the departure of original BigBang drummer Christer Engen in the summer of 1997, it was long uncertain who would become the band's drummer. Singer and guitarist √òystein Greni would often take place behind the drums, and both Martin Horntveth (of Jaga Jazzist) and Christian Syvertsen (January-April 1999) did not stay long.

During this time, Danish rock musician Tim Christensen was just looking for a drummer to replace a replacement for Laust Sonne, who had accepted the position of drummer in the hard rock band D-A-D. They had just finished recording Christensen's first solo album Secrets on Parade and were getting ready to go on tour, so that a drummer was desperately needed at short notice. Since Christensen could not immediately find a suitable drummer, his record company EMI-Medley placed an anonymous ad in the June 2000 issue of GAFFA requesting applications for \\"a drummer for an established Danish rock artist\\". It asked for an experienced, energetic and technically good drummer between 20 and 30 years old that enjoys both hard and melancholic rock, and is available for a year ahead starting July 2000 for a domestic and international tour and related promotional activities. Christensen explains, \\"I subsequently spent endless difficult nights listening through the applications but before choosing between them, but before I had to decide, one of my friends told me about a drummer who had just left his Norwegian band BigBang, which seemed a fantastic opportunity to me. And it went well during a tryout, so we went with him.\\" Olsen moved to CopenhagenTuxen, H. (2001). √Örets GAFFA-prisvindere (This year's GAFFA prize winners).

During the song Surfing the Surface, Olsen would often play on a miniature short-neck Fender Stratocaster, which strongly contrasted with his appearance. The Abbey Road performance was Olsen's final performance in Christensen's band; he left in 2005 to focus on drumming for BigBang and was replaced by Jesper Lind in Christensen's band. In 2008, he did play drums on half of the tracks on Superior (2008).

When phase 1 was completed in May 2004 it was the largest wind farm in Scotland. As a result of 3 extensions it is currently the 2nd largest wind farm in the UK, in terms of nameplate capacity and one of the top five largest in number of turbines. The wind farm was developed and is owned by Fred. Olsen Renewables Ltd. part of the Fred. Olsen Group and is managed by Natural Power, another member of the Fred Olsen group. Turbine maintenance and service is carried out by technicians from Nordex SE and Siemens. Since the completion of Crystal Rig 2 in 2010, Siemens have based their main service centre for all wind farms in the South East with Siemens turbines in use at the turbine control centre at Crystal Rig whose offices are shared with Natural Power. This enables Siemens technicians with easy access to all 60 turbines on site and to the nearby wind farms of Aikengall 2, Carcant, Toddleburn and Black Hill wind farms. Nordex base their service centre in Loanhead which is based half way between Crystal Rig 1/1A and Bowbeat Wind Farm where 24 Nordex N60 Turbines fall on the Moorfoot Hills. The farm was built in four stages:- Crystal Rig: Completed in May 2004 it consists of 20 Nordex N80 turbines producing a maximum of 50 MW. Crystal Rig 1a: An extension completed in May 2007 adding a further 5 N80 turbines to increase the maximum to 62.5 MW. Crystal Rig 2 & 2a: Both completed in September 2010 they consist of 60 Siemens SWT-2.3 turbines in total capable of producing 138 MW. The whole site therefore has 85 turbines and a nameplate capacity of 200.5 MW. Crystal Rig 1 and 1a are connected to the Scottish Power Transmission network at the Dunbar substation 10 km to the north.http://www.fredolsen-renewables.com/?aid=9074435 A dedicated substation has been built on site for the connection of Crystal Rig 2 and 2a. A third phase has also been assessed for potential development.Fred. Olsen Crystal Rig 3 EIA scoping report This would extend the farm to the north of Crystal Rig 2a.

Description and significance With a weight of approximately five pounds, around a foot tall and resembling a lemur, Ekgmowechashala is the only known North American primate of its time; it lived during the late Oligocene and early Miocene. Classification The classification of this form has long been problematic. It was variously classified as a member of the extinct family Omomyidae (related to tarsiers) and the equally extinct Plagiomenidae (related to colugos), but has been recently reassigned to Adapiformes, the extinct relatives of lemurs and other strepsirrhines. A cladistic analysis by Ni et al. (2016) reaffirmed the adapiform placement of Ekgmowechashala by recovering it as sister to Bugtilemur, Gatanthropus, and Muangthanhinius in Ekgmowechashalidae. Paleobiology The shape of its teeth, and their likeness to those of raccoons, indicate that it ate soft fruit provided by the warm forests of the Rocky Mountains during the early Miocene. Fossils Fossil evidence of Ekgmowechashala was discovered on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, an Oglala Sioux Native American reservation in South Dakota. Molars were found in 1981 in the basin of John Day River, and these are in the collection of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture;PLSS data for the site, A5930 (Rudio Creek 4), are missing. in the summer of 1997 John Zancanella of the Bureau of Land Management found a lower molar in the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Ekgmowechashala philotau, known from material in Nebraska and South Dakota, was thought to be the only species of this genus, but material from Oregon has been recently described as a new species, E. zancanellai. A tooth from the Toledo Bend Ranch Local Fauna of far eastern Texas has been assigned to this genus.

Part of the Black and Tan faction, by 1892 he was elected to the Republican Party of Texas's state executive committee, as temporary chairman in 1896, and as permanent state chairman in 1898. During this period, McDonald was also elected as top leader of two black fraternal organizations, serving as Grand Secretary of the state's black Masons for 50 years. In 1906 he founded Fort Worth's first African-American-owned bank as an enterprise of the state Masons; under his management, the bank survived the Great Depression. The black chapters of Masons banked with him, McDonald made loans to black businessmen, and he became probably the first black millionaire in Texas. Early life and education Named after William Shakespeare and James Madison, William Madison McDonald was born on June 22, 1866 in College Mound, Texas, little more than a year after the end of the American Civil War. His father George McDonald was a former slave from Tennessee. He was once held by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, according to a 2008 report by the Dallas Morning News. His mother was Flora (n√©e Scott) McDonald of Alabama, described by one source as a \\"free woman of color\\" before the war, and by another as a \\"former slave.\\" George McDonald was a farmer and blacksmith. After Flora died when William was a child, his father married Belle Crouch. As a teenager, McDonald went to work for rancher and lawyer Captain Z. T. Adams, who took an interest in him. He began teaching the youth about business and law. After graduating from high school in 1884, with the help of Adams and others, McDonald attended Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee. It had been established by the Baptist Church of the North in 1866 as a historically black college, and was important for educating generations of African-American leaders in the South. Career After returning to Texas, McDonald served as principal of an African-American high school in Forney, Texas, for several years, in a rural area outside Dallas. The Reconstruction-era legislature had established the state's first public school system. In order to gain approval, legislators agreed to let local boards determine whether schools would be racially segregated. Education was a high priority for freedmen and their children. McDonald married Alice Gibson, who was a teacher at his school. McDonald helped organized a black state fair in North Texas. McDonald became active in the Republican Party and encouraged blacks to vote; he helped organize the party in Kaufman County and the region. In 1892, McDonald was elected to the Republican Party of Texas's state executive committee. He was a power in state politics for more than thirty years, and became a leader of the \\"Black and Tan\\" faction, African Americans within the Republican Party. He teamed up politically with white businessman Ned Green of Fort Worth, the son of the wealthiest woman in America. Green supported the \\"Black and Tan\\" faction in Republican internal struggles. At the 1896 Republican National Convention, McDonald was given the nickname \\"Gooseneck Bill\\" by a Dallas Morning News reporter. In 1898 he was defeated for state chairman of the Republican Party by Henry Clay Ferguson; the continuing rivalry of their factions resulted in a decrease in black influence in the party.Douglas Hales, \\"Henry Clay Ferguson\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed December 14, 2013. Published by the Texas State Historical Association Through these years, McDonald had also been active in black fraternal organizations, which developed rapidly throughout Texas and the South after the war as blacks established independent networks. He was elected as the Supreme Grand Chief of the Seven Stars of Consolidation of America. In 1890, he also joined the Prince Hall Freemasonry. In 1899 he was elected as Right Worshipful Grand Secretary of the African-American Texas Masons, a position that provided operating direction to the group. Under his leadership, the Masons developed several business enterprises: started \\"a cotton mill, published a magazine, offered insurance to members, and established a bank in Fort Worth.\\" He remained the Grand Secretary of the Texas Masons for 50 years. White Democrats regained power in the state legislature and passed laws making voter registration more difficult, requiring payment of poll taxes and, later, restricting minority participation by the use of white primaries. These actions resulted in effective disenfranchisement of blacks, Mexican Americans, and many poor whites in the state. More than 100,000 blacks voted statewide in elections of the 1890s, but by 1906, their number had dropped to 5,000. \\"Lily White\\" Republicans essentially drove the \\"Black and Tan\\" faction out of power in the party in 1900. McDonald and the Black and Tans temporarily regained power in 1912, before losing it again. McDonald continued to be a notable figure in the national Republican Party, however, attending many national conventions. McDonald turned his energies to business, though he retained an interest in politics. He moved to Fort Worth in 1906, where he became manager of the Fraternal Bank and Trust Company, founded by the Masons as the city's first African-American-owned bank. For a time, it was the bank used by most of the black Mason chapters in the state. With their deposits, McDonald had capital for providing loans to African-American entrepreneurs and could encourage development of their businesses. In that segregated era, blacks had great difficulty gaining financing from white-owned banks. Under McDonald's management, the bank survived the Great Depression, when many other banks went under. According to a 2008 report by the Dallas Morning News, McDonald was \\"probably Texas' first black millionaire.\\" Disappointed with Texas Republicans, McDonald increasingly exercised independence in supporting presidential candidates: favoring Progressive Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and Democrats Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He returned to the Republican Party to support Thomas E. Dewey in his presidential bid against Harry Truman. McDonald died on July 5, 1950, in Fort Worth, where he was buried in Trinity Cemetery. He was survived by his fifth wife. His only child, a son, had predeceased him by thirty years. Legacy and honors In 2002, Forney, Texas, erected a historical marker to acknowledge native son McDonald and his achievements; its text includes the following: \\"Throughout his life, McDonald was a leader in the struggle for social justice, advocating persistence and civic and moral responsibility as the steps to equality.\\" Further reading *Barr, Alwyn.

His tribal name was Goobalathaldin, meaning ‚Äúthe ocean, dancing‚Äù, describing a ‚Äúrough sea‚Äù.Telgen, Diane and Linda R. Andres. eds. ‚ÄúDick Roughsey 1921?‚Äì1985 Percy Trezise 1923‚Äì‚Äù Children‚Äôs Literature Review Vol 41. Toronto: Gale, 1997. 132‚Äì144. Gale Virtual Reference Library, web, 26 September 2010. He was an active and prominent figure involved in reviving and preserving the cultural life of the Lardil people. His best known works are a series of children's picture books that retell traditional Aboriginal stories including ‚ÄúThe Rainbow Serpent‚Äù.  Early life  Dick was born about 1920 on Langu-narnji Island, joined to Mornington Island by a sandbank at low tide, and part of the North Wellesley Islands group in the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was given the tribal name Goobalathaldin. His mother, Kuthakin, gave birth to him under a clump of Pandanus palms.Roughsey, Dick. Moon and Rainbow The Autobiography of an Aboriginal. Sydney: A.H. & A.W. Reed, 1971. Print. His father's name was Kiwarbija. Dick's early memories were of his mother carrying him while she hunted for food. His young life was carefree as he played naked with his brothers. He spent the earliest part of his childhood in the bush living a traditional Indigenous lifestyle learning the ceremonies and dreaming stories of his ancestors. He learnt the rich oral history of the Lardil tribe from his father. His ancestral relatives were three people, Marnbil the leader, his wife Gin-Gin, and her uncle Dewallewul. The activities the ancestors engaged in produced the topography, flora and fauna that exist today. The white missionaries convinced Dick‚Äôs parents to bring him to the Presbyterian mission school on Mornington Island when he was 7 or 8 years old. He was initially scared of his new surroundings but he soon settled in and had a happy but tough Christian education. He was given the name ‚ÄúDick‚Äù at the mission. His father died while he was at the mission school. Dick enjoyed going back to his family home on holidays. On one of these holidays he caught the eye disease trachoma, which affected his vision and caused problems for him in later life. On these holidays he did his fair share of hunting and fishing. He saw his first small aeroplane ‚Äì of the Flying Doctor service ‚Äì while living at the mission school. He left school at about 13 years of age and continued his education with the tribal elders, learning Lardil laws and the ways of hunting. He learnt when to feast and when to dance. He did not undergo ceremonial initiation ‚Äì normally undertaken around this age ‚Äì because the missionaries had asked the elders to stop the ceremonies. Dick spoke Lardil language but not Damin language, as he is not initiated.  Family life  Roughsey and his wife, Elsie, had six children together over a period of almost twenty years. His children Mervyn, Raymond, Kevin, Eleanor, Basil and Duncan were raised primarily by their mother on Mornington Island as their father frequently travelled for work. While he was away Elsie sent him lists of things she wished him to purchase and send back to her on Mornington Island. In his absence, Raymond assumed the father figure role and helped his mother to raise the younger children. The Roughsey children attended school on Thursday Island as Dick believed that an education there would lead to greater employment opportunities on mainland Australia. His brother, Lindsay, also lived on Mornington Island with his family; he too was an artist, regularly sending pieces to Percy Trezise for him to sell. Dick and Lindsay apparently had a troubled relationship.  Career  In about 1940 Roughsey moved to mainland Australia to start paid employment. He worked for a few years in manual jobs such as stockman, deckhand, fisherman, sailor and yardman before serving in the Second World War. When returning from service, Roughsey returned to Mornington Island where he began family life with wife, Elsie. Roughsey began to show interest in painting and, after meeting Percy Trezise, began to develop a personal style that was saleable to a new art market. Roughsey began to work with oil paints and established a body of work that exists today as a record of an emerging contemporary Aboriginal art movement. Roughsey established himself as a well-respected artist and supporter of cultural heritage projects that protect Indigenous culture. His work with Trezise to record the position of ancient Aboriginal sites and important rock paintings was one of the first of its kind and focused on knowledge within the wider community about respect and preservation. In 1968, with Percy Trezise, he rediscovered the important archaeological site of Hann River, in the central Cape York Peninsula. Roughsey was involved with the international exhibition program of the Aboriginal Arts Board (AAB). The AAB was responsible for numerous travelling exhibitions to approximately 40 countries along with publications and gifts of Aboriginal works to overseas museums. This stimulated an interest in Aboriginal art. In 1973, Roughsey was appointed inaugural chair of the AAB by then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and continued in this position until 1975, however, his involvement with the AAB is documented before and after this period.Berrell, Nina. ‚ÄúInroads offshore.

Relationship with Percy Trezise  Roughsey met Percy Trezise in 1962 at Karumba Lodge at the mouth of the Norman River. Trezise was a pilot for Ansett Airlines who painted casually and quickly became Roughsey's mentor. Trezise encouraged Roughsey to paint the stories that were part of his country and not to mimic the styles and narratives of the then famous Albert Namatjira. Trezise encouraged Roughsey to develop his personal painting style on bark paintings initially, then move to oil on canvas. Throughout their relationship Trezise regularly supplied Roughsey with art materials often cutting bark himself from around his home in Cairns.Roughsey, Elsie. ‚ÄúAn Aboriginal Mother Tells of the Old and the New‚Äù. Victoria: McPhee Gribble Publishers, 1984. Print. Trezise was an active supporter and promoter of Roughsey's work, staging many exhibitions and showcases of Mornington Island Art throughout Australia. Trezise became an active participant in preserving Lardil customs and stories and he was given the name 'Warrenby' by Roughsey in 1963. Trezise and Roughsey travelled together for many years throughout Australia exploring cave paintings and documenting them for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.Roughsey, Dick. Papers of Dick Roughsey and Percy Trezise, 1956‚Äì[1994] UQFL386, Box 1, Fryer Library University of Queensland Library. Manuscript. Trezise and Roughsey collaborated on a series of picture books which retold traditional Aboriginal stories, some of which were among the first books to introduce Aboriginal culture to Australian children.  Achievements and awards  Roughsey's passion for the preservation of Indigenous culture and traditions presented him with the opportunity to be appointed to the Aboriginal Advisory Committee for the Australia Council in 1970. In 1971 he wrote the first autobiography by an Aboriginal author. In 1973 Roughsey became the Chair of the Aboriginal Arts Board, continuing this role until 1975. He was also a member of the Institute of Aboriginal studies. * Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Award, Picture Book of the Year, 1974: commended for The Giant Devil-Dingo * Fellowship of Australian Writers Patricia Weickhardt Award to an Aboriginal Writer, 1976 for The Rainbow Serpent * Fellowship of Australian Writers Patricia Weickhardt Award to an Aboriginal Writer, 1976. * Children's Book Council Book of the Year Award, Picture Book of the Year, 1976: winner for The Rainbow Serpent * Children's Book Council Book of the Year Award, Picture Book of the Year, 1979: winner for The Quinkins * IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People) Honour Diploma, Illustration, 1980 for The Quinkins * Children's Book Council Book of the Year Award, Picture Book of the Year, 1983: commended for Turramulli the Giant Quinkin * The Order of the British Empire, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for Service to Aboriginal Art and Culture, 1978 These notable awards for his publications were significant in contributing to cross-cultural communication between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

Plot Based upon a summary in a film publication, Charlie (Fairbanks) has a girlfriend Estrell (De La Motte) who has a theory that if rich people would take a number of poor children into their homes each day, the environment would cause the children to grow up properly. Since Estrell does not know any of these rich people, Charlie offers to arrange a meeting. However, Charlie thinks impostors will do as well as the real rich people, so first he hires some men who turn out to be burglars and gamblers. Then he tries using dummies, but Estell is not fooled and becomes indignant. A wealthy man working as a reporter goes to investigate a report of a man dragging a body which turns out to be Charlie moving a dummy, allowing Charlie to finally meet someone rich.

They are used to describe the impact of health risks and benefits in a population, to inform health policy. Frequently used measures of risk and benefit identified by Jerkel, Katz and Elmore, Jekel JF, Katz DL, Elmore JG Epidemiology, biostatistics, and preventive medicine: Chapter 6 Assessment of risk and benefit in epidemiologic studies Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001 describe measures of risk difference (attributable risk), rate difference (often expressed as the odds ratio or relative risk), population attributable risk (PAR), and the relative risk reduction, which can be recalculated into a measure of absolute benefit, called the number needed to treat. Population Impact Measures are an extension of these statistics, as they are measures of absolute risk at the population level, which are calculations of number of people in the population who are at risk to be harmed, or who will benefit from Public Health interventions. They are measures of absolute risk and benefit, producing numbers of people who will benefit from an intervention or be at risk from a risk factor within a particular local or national population.Syed AM, Talbot-Smith A, Gemmell I. The use of epidemiological measures to estimate the impact of primary prevention interventions on CHD, stroke and cancer outcomes: experiences from Herefordshire, UK. J Epidemiol Glob Health. 2012 Sep;2(3):111-24. They provide local context to previous measures, allowing policy-makers to identify and prioritise the potential benefits of interventions on their own population. They are simple to compute, and contain the elements to which policy-makers would have to pay attention in the commissioning or improvement of services. They may have special relevance for local policy-making. They depend on the ability to obtain and use local data, and by being explicit about the data required may have the added benefit of encouraging the collection of such data. The measures To describe the impact of preventive and treatment interventions, the number of events prevented in a population (NEPP) is defined as \\"the number of events prevented by the intervention in your population over a defined time period\\". NEPP extends the well-known measure number needed to treat (NNT) beyond the individual patient to the population. To describe the impact of a risk factor on causing ill health and disease the Population Impact Number of Eliminating a Risk factor (PIN ‚àí ER ‚àí t) is defined as \\"the potential number of disease events prevented in a population over the next t years by eliminating a risk factor\\". The PIN ‚àí ER ‚àí t extends the well-known population attributable risk (PAR) to a particular population and relates it to disease incidence, converting the PAR from a measure of relative to absolute risk. The components for the calculations are as follows: population denominator (size of the population); proportion of the population with the disease; proportion of the population exposed to the risk factor or the incremental proportion of the diseased population eligible for the proposed intervention (the latter requires the actual or estimated proportion who are currently receiving the interventions ‚Äòsubtracted‚Äô from best practice goal from guidelines or targets, adjusted for likely compliance with the intervention); baseline risk ‚Äì the probability of the outcome of interest in this or similar populations; and relative risk of outcome given exposure to a risk factor or relative risk reduction associated with the intervention. Number of events prevented in your population; NEPP The formula is : \\\\text{NEPP} = N \\\\times P_d \\\\times P_e \\\\times r_u \\\\times \\\\text{RRR} where * N = population size, * Pd = prevalence of the disease, * Pe = proportion eligible for treatment, * ru = risk of the event of interest in the untreated group or baseline risk over appropriate time period (this can be multiplied by life expectancy to produce life-years), * RRR = relative risk reduction associated with treatment. In order to reflect the incremental effect of changing from current to ‚Äòbest‚Äô practice, and to adjust for levels of compliance, the proportion eligible for treatment, Pe, is (P_b - P_t)P_c , where Pt is the proportion currently treated, Pb is the proportion that would be treated if best practice were adopted, and Pc is the proportion of the population who are compliant with the intervention. You can calculate the NEPP and its confidence intervals at this page on the population health decision support & simulation site. [Note: number needed to treat (NNT): 1/(baseline risk x relative risk reduction)] Population impact number of eliminating a risk factor; PIN ‚àí ER ‚àí t The formula is : \\\\text{PIN} - \\\\text{ER} - t = N I_p \\\\cdot \\\\text{PAR} where * N is the number of people in the population; * Ip is the baseline risk of the outcome of interest in the population as a whole; * t is the amount of time over which the outcome is measured. The PAR/F, population attributable risk (or fraction), is calculated for two or multiple strata. The basic formula to compute the PAR for dichotomous variables is : \\\\text{PAR} = P_e \\\\frac{\\\\text{RR}-1}{1 + P_e(\\\\text{RR} - 1)} where * Pe is the prevalence of the population within each income stratum as the exposure, and * RR is the prevalence of risk factors in each stratum relative to the highest income fifth.

It has been designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. History There is evidence of a community at Stydd from the 12th century and there has been a place of worship on the site since no later than the 13th century, possibly since 1190. The church is the only one surviving of a group of buildings acquired by the Knights Hospitallers in the late 13th century. During the First World War, archaeological excavations were undertaken of the area by staff and pupils of nearby Stonyhurst College. Although evidence of buildings surrounding the church was found, identification of their use and date were inconclusive. Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone rubble and has a stone slate roof with simple tie beam trusses. It has a simple rectangular plan consisting of a nave and sanctuary under one roof, with a porch to the south- west. It has no tower. There are square angled buttresses to each corner. There is a doorway on the north side that has a single-chamfered arch. The south doorway is protected by the porch. The west wall has a blocked up doorway. It has a two-centred arch of two moulded orders. There are two Norman windows in the north wall; they are narrow chamfered lights with semi-circular heads. The east window has three lights and the west has two lights; both have intersecting Y-tracery. The south wall has two three-light windows in the Perpendicular style; one has round heads, the other has cusped ogee heads. Interior and fittings The interior of the church measures by . It has a flagged floor and plastered and whitewashed walls. There is a piscina at the east end of the south wall, with a trefoil head, but no bowl. There is no architectural division between the nave and the sanctuary, although the floor latter is slightly raised. There is an oak panelled screen between the two that dates from the 17th or 18th century. The oak pulpit stands against the south wall; it is octagonal with square panels and sits on a stone base. It has a set of stone steps. The octagonal sandstone font is Late Perpendicular in style and has well-preserved carvings of shields. There are stone monuments to Sir Adam and Lady Alicia Clitheroe, and to Bishop Francis Petre.

They differ from Bromeae, another tribe with closed leaf sheaths, in their glabrous ovaries as well as their lemma venation and short short lodicules. They also differ from other members of the Pooideae in having chromosome base numbers of 9, 10, and 8. Geography and ecology The Meliceae are most abundant in temperate regions of Eurasia but are also well represented in temperate regions of North and South America but there are great differences between the genera. Glyceria and Pleuropogon grow in wet areas, often in standing water; Melica and Schizachne tend to grow in dry, well-drained sites. Economic importance Members of the Meliceae have little economic importance. A few species of both Melica and Glyceria are grown as ornamentals; more merit consideration but caution should be used.

Three episodes are released at a time (roughly every week) on three VCD or one DVD, priced in Iran at 25000 rials (currently approximately $2.50). The first set of episodes were released on 23 Shahrivar 1389 (13 September 2010). Background and controversy Production of the series began in June 2009. Bitter Coffee was meant to be produced for television, to be broadcast by the IRIB, but due to various disagreements between IRIB and the series' producers, it didn't air. An alleged reason for disagreement between the producers and IRIB was that the producers required all of the advertisement for the series to be used as their payment, but IRIB refused to agree. Another rumoured reason was disagreement about the planned content of the series. IRIB officials eventually refused to show Bitter Coffee, and the series was eventually distributed in VCD format, at various outlets throughout Iran.

He is about to leave Tehran for good to go back to his hometown by the name of Darab, when he comes across young university student Roya Atabaki (Sahar Jafari-Jozani) who is researching for her final year dissertation, which is regarding the period 1198‚Äì1203, that is said to be a period of turmoil for Iran's ruling elite. Such turmoil that, very few books are available on that period for Roya's research. It is then that Nima receives an anonymous telephone call, which leads him to Niavaran Palace (currently a museum), where he is told to have a coffee and wait. The coffee (which is bitter) is ready and he duly drinks it, his sight becomes hazy, and when he manages to refocus he is in the year 1201 (1822 AD), and the story develops therein. Reception This was a very much anticipated series, as are all of Mehran Modiri's works, partly because it had been 4 years since his last major series work Baghe Mozaffar, discounting the two short series he did for the new years 1387 and 88, and partly because it had been rumoured to be ready for release the previous winter, and then the new year period for 89, before eventually being released at the end of the summer of 1389, and not on television but as a DVD release. As a result, according to the series' website, half a million copies of the first installment were sold on the first day of release alone. At first Ghahve-ye Talkh was planned to be a 90-episode comedy series. Story of Bitter Coffee, like recent Modiri works, is focused on critiquing aspects of Iranian social behaviour.

They caused massive destruction and human death for the Durdzuks, but also greatly shaped the people they became afterward. The ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush bear the distinction of being one of the few peoples who have managed to fight the Mongols and win, not once, but twice. However, this came at great cost to them, and the states they had set up were utterly destroyed as was their previous organized systems. These invasions are among the most significant occurrences in Chechen and Ingush history, and have had long-ranging effects on Chechnya, Ingushetia and their peoples. Prelude During what was the late Middle Ages of Western Europe, the Caucasus was invaded by Mongols and their Turkic vassals. The first appearance of Mongol troops in the Caucasus was an arrival of scouts in 1220-1222.Anchalabze, George. The Vainakhs. Page 24 Kypchak Turkic peoples - some of which becoming future affiliates of Genghis Khan - had been invading and settling areas further and further South and West (a process that had was continuing since the fall of the Khazars), including the fertile river valleys of the Terek and the Kuban. In the 1230s, the Mongols gained rule over the Kypchaks, and turned them into vassals. The Mongol invasion of Georgia had commenced a year earlier to the invasion of the Vainakh kingdom of Dzurdzuketia. The Kingdom of Georgia was traditionally strong ally of Dzurdzuketia, but it was unable to help the Durdzuks when it was under invasion itself. First Mongol Invasion In 1237, the assault on the North Caucasus began. Mongols launched the first attacks: against the Circassians and the Alans (note that at this time, the Alan kingdom was actually highly multiethnic and was partially DzurdzukJaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Page 28). Alanian villages in what is now northern Ingushetia, a part of northwestern Chechnya and North Ossetia were completely destroyed.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Pages 34-5 Having consolidated their rule over the western parts of the Terek, the Mongols then moved East along the river to attack the Durdzuk states of Durdzuketia and Simsir (which was less than modern Chechen and Ingush republican control of the Terek, due to the previously superior position of the Alans). Durdzuketia and Simsir were also attacked from the south and east, by the Mongol troops which had recently conquered Derbent, capital of the Lezghins, in modern Dagestan. The attack on Durdzuketia, already having been commenced, intensified, and the Mongols went as far as the highlands in their attacks. Here, too, the Dzurdzuk proved no match for the arrows and flames of the Mongols, and their villages were totally destroyed. Jaimoukha states that a majority of the Dzurdzuk people were probably killed or enslaved by the Mongols. Within a few years of the invasion, Dzurdzuketia was history, but its resistant people survived up in the mountains. Adding to the misfortune of the Durdzuks, the Mongols successfully established control over much of the Sunzha river, which was an existential threat to the Chechen people due to their need for the Sunzha's (as well as the Terek's) agriculture to support their population. Those remaining joined their mountainous brethren in the highlands (lowland Circassians fled to the Circassian highlands, Alans, to southern parts of Alania, and Dzurdzuks to southern Dzurdzuk territory), fleeing out of lack of an alternative. They regrouped in the mountains and reorganized themselves, planning a counterattack on the Turkic and Mongol invaders. Their goal was to survive both biologically and culturally. The Dzurdzuks had both the forests and the mountains on their side, and waged a successful guerrilla war. Jaimoukha cites a writing of Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, a Papal Ambassador to the Mongols, in 1245-1247. He apparently asserted that the Khan's armies had failed to take the mountainous parts of the eastern part of Alania, to which they had been laying siege for 12 years already, because of the persistence of the defenders (who were, according to Jaimoukha, almost certainly Dzurdzuks given their geographical location). William of Rubruck, the emissary of the Kingdom of France to Sartaq Khan (son of Batu) travelled to the Caucasus in 1253. He wrote that the Circassians (used here to refer not to Adyghe specifically, but rather to all North Caucasians from Anapa to Avaria) had never \\"bowed to Mongol rule\\", despite the fact that whole fifth of the Mongol armies were at that time devoted to the task of crushing North Caucasian resistance.G Rubruquis. 1753. Cited in Jaimoukha's The Chechens, page 35 In 1239-1240, the Mongols deployed Chinese weapons such as catapults with gunpowder were used, as they had earlier done under Genghis Khan in Transoxania in 1219 and 1220. Second Mongol Invasion 256x256px In order to avoid future conflicts with the Mongols and give the Dzurdzuks time to recover, the ruler of the Princedom of Simsir (also known by the shorter name of \\"Simsim\\"; it was a small Dzurdzuk-run feudal principality separate from Alania and Dzurdzuketia, located between the two riversJaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Page 34, section Simsim.), known to the Mongols as Gayur Khan (though this probably was not what his own subjects called him), allied itself with the Golden Horde.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Page 35, Timurlane section To underline Simsim's loyalty to the Horde, Gayur even adopted Sunni Islam as a state religion, although this move was purely symbolic (as the bulk of the Chechens were still pagan and those that were Muslim or Christian were highly syncretic in their practice). However, ultimately this proved to be a mistake. In the second half of the 14th century, the Golden Horde began to weaken. Timurlane (Tamerlan/Timur) dealt a major defeat to the Golden Horde, from which it would never recover.Anchabadze, George. The Vainakhs. Page 25. But Timurlane did not intend on stopping with the Horde, and the Caucasus was one of the many conquests he planned. He then used Simsir's alliance with the Horde as pretext for war against Simsir. He did not stop with Simsir, and continued on, attacking all Dzurdzuk lands. This meant that the Dzurdzuks, still recovering from the damage done by the first Mongol invasion, would have to deal with a second. Timurlane first sent his Turkic imperial warriors to attack the Caucasus in 1390, and greatly stepped up the invasion in 1395-1396. The second Mongol invasion was just as brutal as the first, and many Dzurdzuks were completely annihilated, as were various churches and pagan sanctuaries. However, although initially successful in the lowlands, they were confronted with, and defeated by, the same set of problems the first Mongol invaders faced. Unlike the previous Mongol invaders, Timurlane eventually made peace with the Chechens rather than waste huge amounts of his strength on trying to conquer them. Traditional folk history remembers that in order to give peace, he gave the Chechens his sabre as a gift. > When the battle of the day was over, Timur asked his commanders: \\"Have you > taken away their Phondar‚Äô\\" (musical string instrument). The answer was > negative. And then he said: \\"If you haven‚Äôt taken away the ‚Äòpondar‚Äô, you > only destroyed their army, but you didn‚Äôt subjugate them. So we must make > them our allies. I welcome them, and I wish as a sign of my respect to their > steadfastness and for their edification, to grant them my sabre, which I > haven‚Äôt given to anyone yet.\\" His men didn‚Äôt find the fighting men; they > were all killed.

The Vainakh. Pages 24-25 One particular tale recounts how the former inhabitants of Argun, during the first invasion and the surrounding area held a successful defense (waged by men, women and children) of the slopes of Mount Tebulosmta, before returning after that to reconquer their home region. Jaimoukha notes that many of the tales are, in fact, coincident with historical accounts by Western travelers. End of Dzurdzuk statehood and of the feudal system However, fierce resistance did not prevent the utter destruction of the state apparatus of Dzurdzuketia. Historical and state documents (mainly written in Georgian script) were also destroyed in mass amounts. As Jaimoukha puts it \\"the historical link of times and cultures was broken\\".Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Page 35 The feudal system of vassals and lords also fell into shambles. The contribution of men, women and children of all classes paired with the destruction of the feudal system during the war, rich and poor also helped the Vainakh to develop a strong sense of egalitarianism, which was one of the major causes for the revolt against their new lords after the end of the Mongol invasions. Religious implications Pagan sanctuaries as well as the Orthodox Christian churches in the south were utterly destroyed. Under the conditions of the invasion, Christianity was unable to sustain itself in Chechnya, and as its sanctuaries and priests fell, those who had converted reverted to paganism for spiritual needs. As a result, \\"neo-paganism\\" gained in ascendance, as many new pagan temples were built, while Orthodox Christian churches were converted. Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Pages 122-123 The Malkhi, Lam-Aekkhii, and Kist clans, which reside in southern areas, however, remained Orthodox Christian Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 123. Cultural effects alt= The utter destruction of the Durdzuks' statehood, their lifestyle (and in the south, their religion), and much of their knowledge of history caused them to rebuild their culture in many ways. The population developed various methods of resistance and much of their later lifestyle during the resistance to the Mongols and in between the two wars. The clan system mapped onto battlefield organization. Guerrilla tactics using mountains and forests were perfected. It was during the Mongol invasions that the military defense towers that one associates today with the Vainakh population (see Nakh Architecture) came into being. Many served simultaneously as homes, as sentry posts, and as fortresses from which one could launch spears, arrows, etc. The overcrowding and lack of arable land caused the Chechens to devise new agricultural methods for the highlands including terracing plots and introducing soil. During the period after the invasions, due to contacts between the Durdzuks and Mongol and Turkic populations, there was a low degree of Mongolian cultural influences dating back to the period. The period where the Durdzuk state of Simsir was a tribute to the Golden Horde (during the fourteenth century and ending in 1390 when Simsir was destroyed by Timurlane because of this alliance Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Pages 34-36) is thought by Amjad Jaimoukha to be the origin of the custom of \`amanat, whereby the children of nobles were given as pledged hostages. Such children were sent to the Khanate's court, where they learned the Mongol language, and they could be put to death or enslaved if the Golden Horde desired. This custom later became associated with the giving of hostages to cement pledges across the North Caucasus. Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 137 The concept of mythical beast known as the \\"almaz\\" or \\"hun- sag\\", an evil forest creature with enchanted hair, also dates to Mongol influence (the same is true for the Circassian almesti)Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 246 with the word almaz being a loan from Mongolian where it originally meant \\"forest-man\\"; Jaimoukha also proposes that the Mongol name may have become used in the place of a native name during the sojourn of the Golden Horde over SimsirJaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 157, 281Colarusso, John. ‚ÄòEthnographic Information on a Wild Man of the Caucasus‚Äô, in M.Halpin and M.Ames (eds), Manlike Monsters on Trial, Vancouver and London: University of British Columbia Press, 1980. . Land conflicts with the Nogai over the rivers After defending the highlands, the Chechens attacked Mongol control of the lowlands (after both Mongol invasions this occurred). Much of this area still had nominal Chechen owners (as per the clan system which acknowledges the ownership of a piece of land by a certain teip), even after generations upon generations of not living there. Much was retaken, only to be lost again due to the second invasion. After that, the Chechen managed to take most (but not all) of their former holdings on the Sunzha, but most of the Terek remained in Kypchak hands. The conflicts did not stop however, as there were clans that had ownership of lands now inhabited by Turkic peoples, meaning that if they did not retake the lands, they would lack their own territory and be forever reliant on the laws of hospitality of other clans (doing great damage to their honor). Conflicts between Nakhs and Turkic peoples originating from the Mongol invasion when Dzurdzuks were driven out of the Terek and Sunzha rivers by Turco-Mongolian invaders (the Nogais) continued as late as the 1750s and 1770s. After that, the conflict was with newer arrivals in Northern Chechnya: the Cossacks. End of the Chechen-Georgian alliance and later replacement As the Georgian-allied state of Dzurdzuketia was destroyed, so was the alliance the Dzurdzuks had with the Georgians - the 13th century saw the end of it.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens. Page 270 This meant that when invaded from the north, they found help from other sources. The Chechen feudal state of Simsir, after the First Mongol Invasion (which its monarchy somehow miraculously survived), allied itself not to Georgia, but to the Golden Horde, and even nominally converted to Islam, when faced with the threat of invasion. This underlines the causes for the later conversion of the Chechens to Islam in the 16th to 19th centuries, in order to secure the sympathy of the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the Muslim world in their conflict with the Christian state of Russia.Anciennes Croyances des Ingouches et des Tch√©tch√®nes.

The arrest took place in the build-up to the World Cup Finals where England were to defend the cup they had won in 1966. It provoked widespread reaction in the United Kingdom, including a diplomatic intervention at the behest of the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and across the world in general. On 28 May 1970, Moore was conditionally released and flew to join his teammates in Mexico where he played in all of England's World Cup matches. The Colombian authorities came to the conclusion that Moore was innocent of any wrongdoing, but the case was not formally closed until 1972. Background As part of their preparations for the 1970 FIFA World Cup being held in Mexico that summer, the England football team planned to play two friendly matches in South America to help them prepare for the high altitudes they would face once the tournament began. They were scheduled to play first in Colombia, on 20 May 1970, and then in Ecuador on 24 May. England left their forward base in Mexico City on 18 May and arrived in the Colombian capital Bogot√°, checking into the Hotel Tequendama.Dawson p.72-74 Incident=Alleged theft Although the various accounts of the incident differ somewhat in exact details, the basic outline of what happened is all the same. Located near the foyer of the hotel was a gift shop selling jewellery known as the Fuego Verde (Green Fire). A number of the English players visited the store at one point or another, browsing for gifts to take home. At 6:25pm, Moore went in with Bobby Charlton to look for a present for Charlton's wife. Team doctor Neil Phillips was also in the shop as at one point was Peter Thompson. After looking at some of the items in the display cases, Moore and Charlton found nothing that interested them and left again. They were standing in the foyer when the assistant in the shop, Clara Padilla, came out and accused them of stealing a valuable bracelet from a display case. Moore and Charlton protested their innocence and offered to allow themselves to be searched. Despite their denials, Padilla repeatedly identified them as the culprits of the alleged theft. Soon tourist police and hotel staff were on hand, as were most of the English players. Doctor Phillips went to fetch Alf Ramsey. When he arrived, Ramsey took charge of the situation and spoke to the authorities. Moore and Charlton were briefly questioned, and made an official statement. This appeared to have cleared the matter up, and they even received apologies for the inconvenience. The match against Colombia went ahead, and England won the game 4‚Äì0, with Moore and Charlton both playing. By a gentlemen's agreement, the travelling British sports journalists agreed not to mention the incident. Arrest After their win in Bogot√°, England then proceeded on to their match against Ecuador in Quito and won 2‚Äì0 there. England were scheduled to fly back to Mexico City via Bogot√°, where there would be a four and a half hour stopover. Neil Phillips suggested that to avoid any further problems they should take an alternative route via Panama City. Both Ramsey and Moore rejected this idea, as they felt it would indicate wrongdoing and England took their arranged flight back to Bogot√°. They checked into the same hotel where the bracelet incident had taken place. To fill the time up while they waited for their flight the team sat down to watch the film Shenandoah. As they were sitting there two plainclothes Colombian police officers quietly took Moore out and formally arrested him for theft.McKinstry p.409 The Colombian police acted after a new witness Alvaro Suarez came forward, claiming to have seen Moore take the bracelet. Only lobbying by the British ambassador had stopped Moore from being arrested at the airport in front of cameras. Suarez said he saw what happened through the shop window and supported the version of Clara Padilla.Dawson p. 96-97 As it became clear that Moore might be detained for some time, Ramsey decided that, with the World Cup just a few days away from beginning he had to go on to Mexico without his captain. Two FA officials remained in Bogot√° to assist Moore, and further help was provided by British Embassy officials. Neither Bobby Charlton nor Peter Thompson were arrested, despite their presence in the shop at the time of the incident, and they left the hotel along with the rest of the squad and boarded the plane. Many of the other players hadn't noticed or realised the significance of Moore's absence, as he was often called away to do interviews or meet people. Once they had taken off, Ramsey explained what had happened to the players, staff and press.Dawson p.91-92 The public relations problems of the English were further complicated when Jeff Astle, who hated flying, had several drinks to calm his nerves. Astle was clearly intoxicated once they reached Mexico City, and had to be helped along by his teammates. This led one Mexican newspaper to brand the English as \\"a team of drunks and thieves\\".Dawson p.98 Detention Moore was held in a room in the Bogot√° police headquarters while his fate was decided. He was ultimately charged, and faced with prosecution for theft. In light of the special circumstances, it was arranged that, rather than be sent to one of the city's prisons, Moore was kept under house arrest at the home belonging to the Director of the Colombian Football Federation Alfonso Senior. He was allowed to train, so he could keep up his fitness, although he was constantly followed by armed police guards. In press reports there was initially some confusion about the fact that the alleged theft and Moore's arrest had taken place several days apart.Dawson p.93 The arrest sparked international media attention. Interest in the incident was stoked by the fact that Moore was a particularly well-known footballer generally respected throughout the game. In Britain there was massive press interest in Moore's wife Tina, who was shortly due to go out and watch England play in Mexico, and she was followed by a crowd of journalists wherever she went.Powell p.135-138 Moore was generally perceived to be innocent. Ramsey expressed his own belief in his captain. \\"I should have thought that the integrity of this man would be enough to answer these charges. It is too ridiculous for words\\".McKinstry p.413 The former Brazil coach Joao Saldanha observed that when he had stayed at the hotel with his team Botafogo they had experienced a similar incident ‚Äì in which jewellery had been hidden on them and money demanded in order to avoid a scandal. Saldanha described the allegations against Moore as \\"disgraceful\\" and \\"slander\\".McKinstry p.411 In the England camp many of the players considered the charge ridiculous and treated it as a joke. Ramsey was more concerned as the matter disrupted his carefully planned preparations for the World Cup, and made a contingency plan to play Norman Hunter in Moore's central defensive role and make Alan Mullery the team's captain. He was facing up to the possibility that he might lose Moore for the entire World Cup. In Bogot√°, Moore was taken before a judge, Justice Peter Dorado, and questioned for four hours. Moore denied he knew anything about the theft or had even ever seen the bracelet in question. Confused by the conflicting claims, Justice Dorado arranged for the authorities to stage a re-enactment of the incident with Moore and Padilla. Her version was undermined as she claimed that Moore had slipped the bracelet into the left-hand pocket of his blazer, and it was demonstrated that the blazer had no pocket on the left side. She then changed various parts of her story and eventually left in tears. It was also questioned why the fresh witness, Alvaro Suarez waited four days to come forward.Dawson p. 95-97 There were also conflicting suggestions about the value of the bracelet. Initially it was said to be valued around ¬£500, but later it is claimed to be worth ¬£5,000, while the owner of the shop requested ¬£6,000 in compensation. As Moore was driven back from the re-enactment, cries of \\"Viva Bobby\\" could be heard from the streets.Dawson p.97 Harold Wilson hoped that a strong performance by England at the World Cup would boost the chances of his governing Labour Party being re-elected in the 1970 General Election. Wilson was so concerned by Moore's arrest that he requested repeated lobbying of the Colombian government by the British embassy in Bogot√°. The Colombians were wary of creating what was fast becoming a diplomatic incident. Release On 28 May 1970, Moore was taken before Justice Dorado and told there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution and he was to be set free. Moore released a statement \\"I am happy to be set free and the allegations against me turned out to be groundless\\". He promised to further co-operate with the Colombian authorities and thanked the Colombian people \\"for the many expressions of sympathy and support which I have received from them in the last few days\\".Dawson p.101-102 Moore was given a conditional release that required him to report to the Colombian consulate in Mexico, although this was abandoned soon afterwards with an official stating \\"It was an accusation that needed proof. \\"It was never proved. Moore has no obligation with the embassy. There was never much case\\".Dawson p.179 Moore arrived in Mexico City and then flew on to Guadalajara where the English were preparing to play their opening match against Romania on 2 June. He was greeted warmly at the airport by Ramsey. Moore was taken back to the England team hotel where he was greeted by the other players lined up in a guard of honour to applaud him.Dawson p.102-103 On 2 June he captained England to a 1‚Äì0 victory against Romania. Aftermath England went out of the World Cup in the Quarter Final stage after losing 3‚Äì2 to West Germany. Bobby Moore was widely praised for his performances in the tournament, especially in England's group stage match against Brazil. Ramsey later told a journalist that the incident had been the worst thing that ever happened to him in all his years of football.McKinstry p.411 In October 1970, the Colombian authorities re-opened the case but could find nothing to prove there had ever been a theft. Moore and Charlton had to attend a hearing at Bow Street Magistrates Court after which the case was formally closed in 1972. Despite being cleared the incident continued to dog Moore, and it has been suggested as a major reason why he was never awarded a knighthood. The Fuego Verde shop closed soon afterwards and Clara Padilla ended up fleeing to the United States.Dawson p.104 A general consensus exists that the incident was an attempted frame-up, either to try to secure money from the England camp or possibly to have Moore ruled out of the World Cup, weakening England's chances of winning it. Another theory has occasionally been proposed, that a bracelet was taken by one of the other England players, possibly as part of a prank, and that Moore took the blame to protect them. This was given credence by a comment that Moore made shortly before his death, that seemed to hint at this, when he told biographer Jeff Powell \\"Perhaps one of the lads did something foolish, a prank with unfortunate consequences\\". However, this theory has been dismissed by Tina Moore, his wife at the time, and by Doctor Phillips.McKinstry p.412-413 ReferencesBibliography *Bowler, Dave.

It served historically as an Independent Order of Odd Fellows meeting hall and as a specialty store. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History The Liberty Odd Fellows lodge had been using the building at 20 East Franklin for its meetings since 1889. In need of more space, they constructed a second building next door at 16-18 East Franklin, and like its first building, leased the first floor to commercial businesses and used the second floor as a meeting hall. The original building was then used as a banquet hall. The store at 16 East Franklin storefront has housed the Whiteside Jewelry since the 1920s. The other store front in the building has also held long term tenants, including a variety store and a florist. Architecture The Liberty Lodge building is a two-story brick rectangular structure with a parapet top and a flat roof. It is clad in light-colored glazed brick. The center of the parapet has the Odd Fellows interlocking ring symbol carved into the stone. The second floor has been altered into several individual offices. The building's design is Moderne architecture, early 20th-century commercial. It was designed by architect Charles A. Smith. Smith, a well known local architect, designed over fifty schools in the Kansan city area, as well as some buildings at William Jewell College in Liberty. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an example of combination of building uses typical to small towns, and for its association with architect Charles A. Smith.

Early success for the Cowboys seen them take home the Shamrock Bowl Crown in 1986, 1990 and 1992. The Club folded in the mid 90s but reformed again in 2005, winning the DV8 League in 2009 - the DV8 league was set up for young clubs giving them the base to slowly grow their team and to give the rookie players some valuable game time. After winning the DV8 championship the Cowboys jumped up to the top division in Ireland. 2010 Season In the 2010 season, the Cowboys finished 4‚Äì4 and were close to clinching a play-off berth going down to the last game of the season. 2011 Season Season 2011 saw a marked improvement, with the team going 4‚Äì4 again but going through via the Wildcard Game, in which they beat Belfast Trojans, 17‚Äì14. That meant a visit to Limerick to take on the Vikings in their own patch, and although it was a close-fought game, Cowboys lost 21‚Äì8. 2012 Season Season 2012 was one which started out with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm but a poor start put that to bed and Cowboys ended with a record of 2‚Äì6, their poorest since re-forming and joining IAFL in 2010. 2013 Season Season 2013 was another season of disappointment that promised so much, a tough opener against defending champions Belfast Trojans saw the Cowboys struggle to a 46‚Äì13 loss. The 'Boys got their one and only win in a 23‚Äì0 romp at home to West Dublin Rhinosin their third game and narrowly lost 0‚Äì7 away to the same side. Cowboys where close to ending the season on a high at home to Carrick Knights but a last-minute missed field goal saw the game end in an 18‚Äì18 draw. A disappointing season ended with a 1‚Äì6‚Äì1 record. 2014 Season A slightly improved 2014 season seen the Cowboys move to Chambers Park, Portadown and while the end results where disappointing with a 2-6 record, the 'Boys where within a score from defeating the visiting Dublin Rebels and Trinity College Dublin. 2015 Season Season 2015 saw the Cowboys finally make a return SBC Playoffs with a 3-5 record, etching wins against South Dublin Panthers, West Dublin Rhinos and Carrickfergus Knights. The Knights game will be remembered for one of the most dramatic comebacks in IAFL history, the Knights where leading 22-0 with 5.21 left on the clock before the Cowboys mounted a stirring comeback, scored a Touchdown with the final play to tie the game 22-22 and Luis Alberto slotting over the XP to take the game 22-23. The playoff venture ended in the Wildcard round, going down 62-19 to the Dublin Rebels.

Hoxie was born in Waterloo, Iowa and earned his undergraduate degree in 1940 from Iowa State Teachers College, which is now known as the University of Northern Iowa. During World War II, Hoxie served as a captain in the United States Army Air Forces and attained the rank of brigadier general as a reserve officer. After completing his military service, he earned graduate degrees from the University of Virginia and Columbia University, and served as an administrator at the University of Denver and C. W.

Long Island University chose Hoxie as the dean of its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences of Long Island University in 1954 and after a series of promotions was named the school's chancellor in 1964. By 1967, a conflict had arisen between Hoxie and William Birenbaum the vice president and provost of LIU's Brooklyn Center. Hoxie, described by The New York Times as an \\"educational traditionalist\\", had sought to raise tuition as a means of dealing with the college's mounting debt burden, while Birenbaum supported keeping lower tuition and approved changes that eliminated a dress code and allowed students to have a beard.Fox, Margalit. \\"William M. Birenbaum, College Leader, Dies at 87\\", The New York Times, October 8, 2010. Accessed October 10, 2010. In March 1967, Hoxie demanded Birenbaum's resignation, despite the fact that the faculty had voted by a nearly 4-1 margin to keep him as provost. 1,500 students gathered to mount what turned out to be an unsuccessful protest demanding that Birenbaum be reinstated, chanting \\"We want Bill\\" and physically confronting Hoxie, who was rescued by campus police after protesters had ripped his coat. Hoxie told students that \\"This is a day of infamy in the life of the student body\\". Hoxie was asked to resign in September 1968 by the board of trustees. After leaving LIU, Hoxie founded the Library of Presidential Papers, an organization that was later named the Center for the Study of the Presidency and which studies the American presidency, publishing the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly for historians.

The former Perpetual Help cager was chosen by Presto coach Jimmy Mariano when the Tivolis traded Manny Victorino to Pepsi. Hawkins twisted his knee during practice and was forced to sit out in the entire first conference. He finally debut in Tivoli Milk uniform in the All-Filipino Conference and asserted his might. In 1993, he was absorbed by newcomer Sta. Lucia Realtors, which took over the disbanded Presto franchise.

Plot Onboard a ship traveling to Liverpool, England from the West Indies, Anglican missionary's widow Olivia Harwood (Ann Todd) is prevailed on to help nurse malarial patients on the lower decks. There she meets the suavely handsome Mark Bellis (Ray Milland), who has been taken ill. Despite Mark's vagueness about his life and past, the couple strike up a friendship. Fully recovered by the time the ship docks, Mark persuades Olivia to allow him to take up residence in the lodging house she has inherited from her late husband. He proceeds to work a smooth line of seduction on her, while still finding time to also use his charms on the more worldly and vulgar Kitty (Moira Lister). Mark's past as an art thief and forger is revealed as he reunites with former partner-in-crime Edgar Bellamy (Raymond Lovell) and the two plan a daring art heist. Things go awry, and they are forced into a rooftop flight, narrowly avoiding police bullets. Returning to Olivia, he tells her he intends to leave London to try to make good elsewhere. However, she has now fallen under his romantic spell and is prepared to do anything to keep him with her. The couple are in dire need of money, and Olivia is persuaded to insinuate herself into the home of her wealthy former schoolfriend Susan Courtney (Fitzgerald) and her older husband Henry (Raymond Huntley). She finds Susan in a state of neurosis and barely suppressed hysteria, worn down by the criticisms of the cold and sneering Henry, who agrees to employ her as Susan's live-in companion. Under Mark's urging, she immediately begins to pilfer stocks and bonds and small valuables from the Courtney household, passing them on to Mark to turn into cash. Mark meanwhile has discovered an old bundle of letters from Susan to Olivia, containing youthfully indiscreet descriptions of romantic dalliances and questionable moral conduct. Realising that making public the contents of the letters would ruin the Courtneys' social reputation, he believes that he has hit the financial jackpot. As low as she has already sunk under his influence however, Olivia finds the notion of blackmail repugnant and a step too far down the road of criminality. She flees from the Courtneys and looks into the possibility of a return to overseas missionary work, only to find that a lone woman is not wanted. She finds herself sheltering in a gloomy church, where Mark somehow manages to track her down. In despair, she falls for his blandishments and submits herself again to his control and instructions, blackmail and all. Olivia returns to the Courtney household and sets in motion the blackmail plan, while Mark continues to dally with Kitty and gifts her a locket which was given to him by Olivia. Unknown to Olivia or Susan, Henry has become exasperated by Susan's apparent inability to produce the heir he craves, and is plotting to have her committed to a distant mental asylum. He has also employed a private detective (Leo G. Carroll), who has managed to trace the missing stocks and bonds back to Mark and has built up a dossier of his criminal past. Henry locks the horrified Susan in her room to await the arrival of the sanatorium doctors and orders Olivia out of the house. At Mark's behest, she returns to step up the blackmail threat, but is countered by Henry confronting her with the information he has on Mark, which would be more than enough to hang him. A struggle ensues, and Henry collapses with a life-threatening heart attack. Olivia releases Susan and tricks her into giving her husband a dose of medicine laced with poison. Henry succumbs, the police are summoned and the hopelessly confused and incoherent Susan makes what sounds like a confession to murder. She is taken away to prison to face the prospect of the gallows. Mark announces his intention to take Olivia away with him to a new life in America, beyond the reach of British prosecution. Olivia however is conscience-stricken about Susan, and matters take a fatal turn when she runs into Kitty, wearing the incriminating locket. All her illusions about Mark's love for her suddenly shattered, she finally realises that she has all along been no more than a willing pawn in his game. Keeping her own counsel, she waits until the opportunity arises in a hansom cab to take her ultimate revenge by fatally stabbing Mark. The film ends with Olivia entering a police station to turn herself in. Cast * Ray Milland as Mark Bellis * Ann Todd as Olivia Harwood * Geraldine Fitzgerald as Susan Courtney * Leo G.

So, by the time the poison is passing and the big retribution scenes set in, the audience is likely to be meandering down the street several blocks ahead of them.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Movie review: 'So Evil My Love,' starring Ann Todd and Ray Milland, new feature at Rivoli.\\" The New York Times, 22 July 1948.

Most optical mesh networks use fiber-optic communication and are operated by internet service providers in metropolitan and regional but also national and international scenarios. They are faster and less error prone than other network architectures and support backup and recovery plans for established networks in case of any disaster, damage or failure. Currently planned satellite constellations aim to establish optical mesh networks in space by using wireless laser communication. Example of mesh network: NSFNET 14nodes History of transport networks Transport networks, the underlying optical fiber-based layer of telecommunications networks, have evolved from Digital cross connect system (DCS)-based mesh architectures in the 1980s, to SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Networking/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) ring architectures in the 1990s. In DCS-based mesh architectures, telecommunications carriers deployed restoration systems for DS3 circuits such as AT&T; FASTAR (FAST Automatic Restoration)FAST Automatic Restoration - FASTAR.FAST Automatic Restoration - FASTAR.FAST Automatic Restoration - FASTAR. and MCI Real Time Restoration (RTR),Real Time Restoration (RTR). restoring circuits in minutes after a network failure. In SONET/SDH rings, carriers implemented ring protection such as SONET Unidirectional Path Switched Ring (UPSR)Unidirectional Path Switched Ring (UPSR). (also called Sub-Network Connection Protection (SCNP) in SDH networks) or SONET Bidirectional Line Switched Ring (BLSR)Bidirectional Line Switched Ring (BLSR).

There have been attempts at improving and/or evolving traditional ring architectures to overcome some of its limitations, with trans-oceanic ring architecture (defined in ITU-T Rec. G.841ITU-T Rec.

(related presentation). next- generation SONET/SDH equipment that can handle multiple rings, or have the ability to not close the working or protection ring side, or to share protection capacity among rings (e.g., with Virtual Line Switched Ring (VLSR)Virtual Line Switched Ring (VLSR).). Technological advancements in optical transport switches Also referred to as optical cross-connects or optical switches. The term optical does not imply that the equipment handles signals completely in the optical domain, and most of the times, it does not and instead it grooms, multiplexes, and switches signals in the electrical domain, although some equipment (referred to as photonic cross-connect) do switching (only) fully in the optical domain without any O-E-O conversion. in the first decade of the 21st century, along with continuous deployment of dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) systems, have led telecommunications service providers to replace their SONET ring architectures by mesh-based architectures for new traffic. The new optical mesh networks support the same fast recovery previously available in ring networks while achieving better capacity efficiency and resulting in lower capital cost. Such fast recovery (in the tens to hundreds of milliseconds) in case of failures (e.g., network link or node failure) is achieved through the intelligence embedded in these new optical transport equipment, which allows recovery to be automatic and handled within the network itself as part of the network control plane, without relying on an external network management system. Optical mesh networks Switching, multiplexing, and grooming of traffic in an OEO device Optical mesh networks refer to transport networks that are built directly off the mesh-like fiber infrastructure deployed in metropolitan, regional, national, or international (e.g., trans-oceanic) areas by deploying optical transport equipment that are capable of switching traffic (at the wavelength or sub-wavelength level) from an incoming fiber to an outgoing fiber. In addition to switching wavelengths, the equipment is typically also able to multiplex lower speed traffic into wavelengths for transport, and to groom traffic (as long as the equipment is so-called opaque - see subsection on transparency). Finally, these equipment also provide for the recovery of traffic in case of a network failure. As most of the transport networks evolve toward mesh topologies utilizing intelligent network elements (optical cross- connects or optical switches ) for provisioning and recovery of services, new approaches have been developed for the design, deployment, operations and management of mesh optical networks. Optical switches build by companies such as Sycamore and Ciena (with STS-1 granularity of switching) and Tellium (with STS-48 granularity of switching) have been deployed in operational mesh networks. Calient has built all-optical switches based on 3D MEMS technology. Optical mesh networks today not only provide trunking capacity to higher-layer networks, such as inter-router or inter-switch connectivity in an IP, MPLS, or Ethernet-centric packet infrastructure, but also support efficient routing and fast failure recovery of high-bandwidth point-to-point Ethernet and SONET/SDH services. Several planned satellite constellations such as SpaceX Starlink intended for global internet provisioning aim to establish optical mesh networks in space. The constellations consisting of several hundred to thousand satellites will use laser communication for high-throughput optical inter-satellite links. The interconnected network architecture allows for direct routing of user data from satellite to satellite and enables seamless network management and continuity of service. Recovery in optical mesh networks Shared backup path protection - before failure Shared backup path protection - after failure and recovery Optical mesh networks support the establishment of circuit-mode connection-oriented services. Multiple recovery mechanisms that provide different levels of protection Protection refers to a pre-planned system where a recovery path is pre-computed for each potential failure (before the failure occurs) and the path uses pre-assigned resources for failure recovery (dedicated for specific failure scenarios or shared among different failure scenarios) or restoration With restoration, the recovery path is computed in real time (after the failure occurs) and spare capacity available in the network is used to reroute traffic around the failure. against different failure modes are available in mesh networks. Channel-, link-, segment- and path- protection are the most common protection schemes. P-cycles is another type of protection that leverages and extends ring-based protection. Restorationis another recovery method that can work on its own or complement faster protection schemes in case of multiple failures. In path- protected mesh networks, some connections can be unprotected; others can be protected against single or multiple failures in various ways. A connection can be protected against a single failure by defining a backup path, diverse from the primary path taken by the connection over the mesh network. The backup path and associated resources can be dedicated to the connection (Dedicated Backup Path Protection, aka dedicated (1+1) path protection, Subnetwork Connection Protection (SNCP) in SDH networks, or UPSR in SONET ring networks), or shared among multiple connections (Shared Backup Path Protection), typically ones whose primary paths are not likely to fail at the same time, thereby avoiding contention for the shared resources in case of a single link or node failure. A number of other protection schemes such as the use of pre-emptible paths, or only partially diverse backup paths, can be implemented. Finally, multiple diverse routes can be designed so that a connection has multiple recovery routes and can recover even after multiple failures (examples of mesh networks across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans Optical mesh network proves its worth for Verizon during Japanese earthquake). Transparency Opaque switching of traffic between fiber links Transparent switching of traffic between fiber links Traditional transport networks are made of optical fiber-based links between telecommunications offices, where multiple wavelengths are multiplexed to increase the capacity of the fiber. The wavelengths are terminated on electronic devices called transponders, undergoing an optical-to-electrical conversion for signal Reamplification, Reshaping, and Retiming (3R). Inside a telecommunications office, the signals are then handled to and switched by a transport switch (aka optical cross- connect or optical switch) and either are dropped at that office, or directed to an outgoing fiber link where they are again carried as wavelengths multiplexed into that fiber link towards the next telecommunications office. The act of going through Optical-Electrical-Optical (O-E-O) conversion through a telecommunications office causes the network to be considered opaque. When the incoming wavelengths do not undergo an optical-to-electrical conversion and are switched through a telecommunications office in the optical domain using all-optical switches (also called photonic cross-connect, optical add- drop multiplexer, or Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) systems), the network is considered to be transparent. Hybrid schemes that leverage optical bypasses and provide limited O-E-O conversions at key locations across the network, are referred to as translucent networks. ROADM- based transparent optical mesh networks have been deployed in metropolitan and regional networks since the mid-2000s.ROADMs and the Future of Metro Optical Networks, Heavy Reading report In the early 2010s, operational long-distance networks still tend to remain opaque, as there are transmission limitations and impairments that prevent the extension of transparency beyond a certain point.J. Strand, A. Chiu, and R. Tkach. Issues for routing in the optical layer. IEEE Communications Mag., February 2001. Routing in optical mesh networks Routing is a key control and operational aspect of optical mesh networks. In transparent or all-optical networks, routing of connections is tightly linked to the wavelength selection and assignment process (so-called Routing and Wavelength Assignment, or \\"RWA\\"). This is due to the fact that the connection remains on the same wavelength from end-to-end throughout the network (sometimes referred to as wavelength continuity constraint, in the absence of devices that can translate between wavelengths in the optical domain). In an opaque network, the routing problem is one of finding a primary path for a connection and if protection is needed, a backup path diverse from the primary path. Wavelengths are used on each link independently of each other's. Several algorithms can be used and combined to determine a primary path and a diverse backup path (with or without sharing of resource along the backup path) for a connection or service, such as: shortest path, including Dijkstra's algorithm; k-shortest path,K-th Shortest Path Problem. such as Yen's algorithm; edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing, including Suurballe's algorithm;J. W. Suurballe, R. E. Tarjan, \\"A quick method for finding shortest pairs of disjoint paths\\". and numerous heuristics. In general, however, the problems of optimal routing for Dedicated Backup Path Protection with arbitrary Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs), and for Shared Backup Path Protection are NP-complete. Applications The deployment of optical mesh networks is enabling new services and applications for service providers to offer their customers, such as * Quality of Service (QoS) protection, allowing services with different levels of protection: pre- emptable, unprotected, protected with guaranteed recovery against single link or single node failure, protected against multiple failures (through a combination of protection and restoration) * Dynamic services such as Bandwidth-on-Demand (BoD),Verizon's Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) Just-In-Time (JIT) bandwidth, bandwidth scheduling, and bandwidth brokering * Optical virtual private networksPHOTONIC NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS, special issue on \\"Optical Virtual Private Networks (oVPNs)\\" * Multicast lightpaths It also supports new network paradigms such as * IP-over-optical network architecturesRFC 3717 - IP over Optical Networks: A Framework Related network architectures Mesh networking in general and wireless mesh networking in particular.

While still at school she played the guitar with the Jamaican Folk Singers.Fuller, Sophie. 'Alberga, Eleanor' in Grove Music Online (2001) She studied music at Jamaica School of Music and in 1970 she won the biennial West Indian Associated Board Scholarship which allowed her to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where one of her teachers was Richard Stoker. After completing her studies, she performed as a concert pianist. In 2001 she ended her career as a performer to concentrate full-time on composition and was awarded a NESTA Fellowship. Alberga works as a guest lecturer at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She has been pianist and Music Director for the London Contemporary Dance Theatre and played with Nanquindo (four players on two pianos). Her music has been performed by the Royal Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic, Bournemouth Sinfonietta, London Mozart Players and The Women's Philharmonic of San Francisco, and in countries including Australia, South America, Canada, Europe and China. As a composer Alberga uses tonal harmony and emphasises repeated rhythmic patterns.

He was also the public address announcer for the NFL's Carolina Panthers from the team's inception in 1995 until midway through the 2009 season. He also called the first seven editions of the Meineke Car Care Bowl (known as the Continental Tire Bowl from 2002 to 2004). A native of nearby Gastonia, Robinson graduated from the University of Maryland in 1983 and worked at several Charlotte radio stations before landing the morning drive-time slot at WBT in 1992. In 1997, he moved to then-sister television station WBTV as an anchor and reporter. After being passed over for a promotion, he moved to WCBD-TV in Charleston, South Carolina as the main evening anchor. He commuted to Charlotte for the next two years for Panthers games. In 2006, he moved back to Charlotte as morning host at WDYT, a station in nearby Kings Mountain that had recently boosted its daytime power to cover Charlotte. Almost two years into this job, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in his throat. Doctors managed to catch it before it spread, however. Having been laid off from WDYT, he then moved to WKQC as morning host in December 2008. This slot, and his tenure as Panthers PA announcer, ended abruptly in October 2009 when he was arrested for telephoning and texting his estranged wife in violation of a restraining order. In December 2009, Robinson told The Charlotte Observer that he'd been abusing drugs almost continuously since he was 12, primarily heroin and cocaine. He said that his habit got so severe that while he worked in Charleston, he was often high on the air. His estranged second wife believes his spiral into drug abuse was due to being molested for five years by a man who coached him in basketball.

He was educated at an elementary school, and began work in a hairdresser's shop at the age of 9. He later became President of the National Federation of Hairdressers. During the First World War, he served overseas with the Royal Field Artillery. He was elected to Manchester City Council in 1923, and became an alderman in 1939. Thorneycroft unsuccessfully contested the borough of Blackpool at the 1935 general election, and was elected to Parliament seven years later at a Manchester Clayton by-election in October 1942 after the death of the Labour MP John Jagger.Craig, page 186 During the Second World War, the parties in the coalition government did not contest by-elections when vacancies occurred in seats held by their coalition partners, but in the Clayton by-election Thorneycroft was opposed by an independent candidate, Major Hammond Foot. Thorneycroft received a letter of support signed by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the leaders of the other coalition parties. He was the first Labour candidate to receive such a letter, and won the seat with 93.3% of the votes. He held the seat until the constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, when he retired from Parliament. From 1945 to 1947, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Lord Pethick- Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India and Burma. He was then PPS to Arthur Henderson, the Secretary of State for Air, from 1947 until the Labour Government left office in 1951. He died in hospital in London on 7 March 1956, aged 64.

The name \\"Dranse\\" comes from the former Drantia, based on the hydronym dur-, dora and the suffix -antia. Geography The Dranse is formed from the combination of three mountain rivers originating from the peaks of the upper Chablais Alps, which converge upstream from the delta: * To the east, the Dranse d'Abondance irrigates the Val d'Abondance and passes through the communes of Abondance and Ch√¢tel; * To the south, the Dranse de Morzine passes through Morzine, Saint-Jean-d'Aulps and the Gorges du Pont-du-Diable; * To the west, the Brevon, also called the Dranse de Bellevaux, originates from Roc d'Enfer and passes through Lac de Vallon and the villages of Bellevaux, Vailly and Reyvroz. The Dranse d'Abondance is considered the higher-ordered stream of the Dranse. The Dranse de Morzine is consequently considered its tributary, according to Sandre, the French National Service for Water Data and Common Repositories Management. The Dranse empties into Lake Geneva and forms a delta, which is integrated into the Delta de la Dranse National Nature Reserve, situated to the east of the commune of Thonon-les-Bains, which although small at an area of , offers an incomparable botanic diversity. The river is long. Whitewater kayakers and commercial rafting companies frequently run this river.Dranse de Thonon, Garth Ehrhardt Hydrology The Dranse is a high-volume river, as are all the rivers which originate in the Alpine mountain ranges. Its discharge was observed for a period of 97 years (1906‚Äì2003) in Reyvroz, a locality in the department of Haute-Savoie situated on the southern bank of Lake Geneva at the same elevation as its outlet. The drainage basin for the river is in its totality , which is not quite three times the surface area of the city of Paris. The annual average discharge of the river at Reyvroz is per second. The Dranse is a typical seasonal river regime, with depends slightly on a small rain component. It exhibits sharply delineated seasonal fluctuations in discharge, which is characteristic of Alpine waterbodies. High flows occur in the springtime and are attributed to snowmelt. These accompany average monthly discharges of around per second from April to June (the maximum being reached in May). At the end of June, discharge rates sharply drop while the volume moves downstream. From the end of July to the end of February discharge is continuous, fluctuating between per second, with a low of in August, and a small \\"peak\\" cut in November, linked to the autumnal rain. However, these fluctuations are much more pronounced over short periods and depend on the year. During times of low water, the low water discharge can fall as low as per second, in the case of a dry quinquennial period, and although low, it is considered normal in the regions of the Alps and Prealps. In terms of floods which, although uncommon, can be very important, measures with certain \\"eau du midi\\". The maximum instantaneous discharge for a two-year (P2) and five-year (P5) flood events are respectively. The ten-year flood event (P10) is per second, the twenty- year flood event (P20) , and the fifty-year flood (P50) . The highest instantaneous flow recorded by the Reyvroz station was per second on the , while the maximum daily value was per second on . For comparison, the June 1963 value is comparable to a vicennial flood event, and is thus considered not that exceptional. The discharge volume of Dranse is augmented by the abundant precipitation in the northern Alps. The runoff curve number for its drainage basin is annually, which elevated, is three times greater than the average for all of France. The specific discharge (Qsp) of the river reaches per second and square kilometer of the basin.

She was equipped with a dual propulsion system, both hand and steam-driven, although the hand-driven portion was removed early in the ship's career due to complaints from the crew. The ship was put into reserve in 1890 and used as a gunnery target in 1907. Design and description In 1865 the Navy Minister, Baltzar J. van Platen, persuaded the Riksdag of the Estates to establish the Royal Skerry Artillery as part of the Swedish Army to defend the inner Swedish waters and protect the flanks of Swedish fortresses. This force was to be equipped with ten small monitors to operate in shallow waters that could navigate the G√∂ta Canal system that linked Gothenburg () on the west coast to S√∂derk√∂ping on the Baltic Sea. HSwMS Sk√∂ld was the second of these monitors. She was designed by the inventor John Ericsson and Lieutenant John Christian d'Ailly. Sk√∂ld measured long overall and had a beam of . She had a draft of and displaced . Her crew initially numbered 40 officers and men, but it was reduced to 29 when the rowing mechanism was removed early in the ship's career.Harris 1994, pp. 29‚Äì30 Sk√∂lds most unusual feature was that John Ericsson designed, and had built in New York City, a combined hand and steam propulsion system. Seats for 24 rowers were placed in front of the steam engine and boiler and the rowers used levers and a crank connected to the propeller shaft to turn it fast enough to move the ship at a speed of . The ship also had a single horizontal 2-cylinder steam engine that was powered by a single semi-circular fire-tube boiler. The monitor had a maximum speed under steam of . The ship was briefly armed with a single M/66 smoothbore gun, mounted in a long, fixed, oval-shaped turret, before being rearmed in 1870 with a M/69 rifled breech loader.Harris 1994, p. 29 The M/69 gun weighed and fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . At its maximum elevation of 7.5¬∞ the gun had a range of . During the late 1870s Sk√∂ld received a 10-barreled M/75 machine gun designed by Helge Palmcrantz. The machine gun weighed and had a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute. Its projectiles had a muzzle velocity of and a maximum range of .Bojerud, pp. 177‚Äì78 Sk√∂ld had a complete waterline armor belt of wrought iron that was thick. The deck was thick.

She is considered one of the greatest exemplars of Peruvian painting, having won the prestigious Bienal of Teknoquimica Prize for painting. Her teacher, Ricardo Grau, had also been presented the Bienal award in a previous year. Tsuchiya graduated from the Escuela Nacional Superior Aut√≥noma de Bellas Artes of Peru in 1959. Tsuchiya‚Äôs work addressed the contemporary issues of gender and identity and has been linked to earlier Surrealists.  Biography =Infancy Tilsa Tsuchiya was born in Supe, Peru, a city north of Lima, in 1928. She was the seventh of eight children orphaned at a young age. Her childhood nickname was \\"la chola.\\" At eight years old she learned how to draw. Her father, Yoshigoro Tsuchiya (1878‚Äì1947), was born in Chiba, Japan, and arrived in Peru after studying medicine in the United States. He married Maria Luisa Castillo, who was born at Chavin, Peru and a descendant of Chinese immigrants. Education Tsuchiya started her studies in the Escuela Nacional Superior Aut√≥noma de Bellas Artes of Peru in Lima in 1947. In that same year, she dealt with death of her father and, two years later, the death of her mother. The loss of her mother prompted her to stop her studies in order to start a window-making and framing shop with her brother Wilfredo. After her return to the Escuela Nacional Superior Aut√≥noma de Bellas Artes of Peru, she enrolled in the workshops of artists Carlos Quizpez Asin and Ricardo Grau, aside from being a student of the particular painter Manuel Zapata Orihuela. From the start, she was set apart by her unique personality and style. She graduated with the class of 1959 with honors and obtained the Gran Medalla de Oro (Great Gold Medal) in painting. In 1957, while still a student, she won the award Segundo Premio del Sal√≥n Municipal. She was also a member of the Peruvian envoy to the \\"Primera Bienal de la Juventud\\" which convened in Paris in 1958. In 1960, she traveled to France to study printmaking and engraving at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and Art History at the Sorbonne, where she lived until the mid 1970s. Her work corresponding to this period is marked by a dark tone and minimalist aesthetic.  Artistic career  Imaginary, sexually-charged compositions in a small format gained notoriety with her exposition in the Institution of Contemporary Art in 1968. In 1970, she received the Teknoquimica Award, a recognition that solidified her ascending artistic career. A painting in 1974 transformed the vertical, biomorphically carved ‚Äúhitching-post‚Äù sun stone at Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Incas, into a figure rising like a Maya Chac Mool. In 1975 she returned to Peru and installed public sculpture in Portugal Street, in the district of Bre√±a. Soon after her work took on elements of fantasy and narrative, incorporating aspects of the imagery and of the mythology of the Peruvian indigenous with European influences. Tsuchiya represented Peru at the XV Bienal de S√£o Paulo in 1979, and her work was included in the Art of the Fantastic: Latin America 1927‚Äì1987 exhibition in Indianapolis.Marissa Del Toro. \\"Contesting Categories of the 'Fantastic' and 'Surreal': A Visual Reading of Tilsa Tsuchiya's and Francisco Toledo's Multidimensional and Complex Artistic Vision.\\" M.A. thesis, University of Texas, San Antonio, 2016. Personal life In 1948 in Hu√°nuco, Peru, she gave birth to her first child, Orlando Cornejo Tsuchiya. In 1963 she married her husband, Charles Mercier, a Frenchman. Tsuchiya obtained French citizenship and gave birth to her second child, Gilles Mercier Tsuchiya, the same year.

Later in life, he was convicted of gun running in France when he tried to send arms from the United States to the Irish National Liberation Army in Northern Ireland. After being released from prison, he moved to Nicaragua, where he shot and killed an intruder in his Managua home. He later spent a year living in Cuba but became disillusioned with Communism and was reportedly smuggled from Mexico into the U.S. by his ex-wife. Early life Norton was born to Andrena \\"Rena\\" (n√©e Callahan; March 20, 1902 ‚Äì October 16, 1989California Death Index. - California Department of Health Services Office of Health Information. - SS#: 571-20-8989. ) and William Wallace Norton (February 14, 1900 ‚Äì July 18, 1973NOTE: The California Death Index (CDI) lists the date of birth for W.

His family moved to Berkeley, California, and then later to El Monte. He attended El Monte High School, where he was class president. World War II During World War II, Norton enlisted in the United States Army and served in Europe as an infantry officer with 5th Infantry, 71st Infantry Division with Patton's Third Army.http://jeffcramer.blogspot.com.au/2010/01/very-candid-conversation-with- william.html. He started writing, using his life experience of growing up poor and serving in the military, and some of his plays were produced by local theater companies. He joined the Communist Party in his youth and in 1958 was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, though he did not name anyone. Hollywood He wrote for the television series The Big Valley, which was broadcast from 1965 to 1968. His big screen breakthrough came with his script for the 1968 film The Scalphunters, set in the antebellum West, with the movie starring Burt Lancaster, Ossie Davis and Shelley Winters. Other screenplays that Norton wrote included the Angie Dickinson vehicle Big Bad Mama, produced by Roger Corman, and the John Wayne detective film Brannigan (1975). He wrote the Burt Reynolds vehicles Sam Whiskey, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing, White Lightning and Gator. When asked by a nurse the day before he died if she would know any of Norton's films, he replied \\"I don't think your I.Q. is low enough\\". Ireland After moving to Ireland in the mid-1980s, Norton was angered by attacks staged against Roman Catholic residents of Northern Ireland. He flew back to the U.S. and purchased a number of guns to bring back to supply the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). Norton also purchased a camping van and had a hidden compartment made. The van was shipped aboard a Panamanian ship inside a container, from Los Angeles to the port at Rotterdam. The van, still inside the container, was then put on a truck and hauled from Rotterdam, through Belgium, to the port of Le Havre, France. Authorities were watching the van, which had two submachine guns, 12 rifles, 23 revolvers and 2,200 rounds of ammunition in the hidden compartment. Norton and his wife, Eleanor, were arrested on June 11, 1986, trying to retrieve the vehicle and were both convicted. Also arrested with them were two INLA members, James MacLaughin and Sean Hughes, and also Hughes' girlfriend Susan May. Susan May's two children, who were with her, were taken to a children's home. Prison In August 1987, William Norton, Hughes and MacLaughin were each sentenced to four years in prison, while Eleanor Norton was sentenced to three years with two of those suspended. Additionally, the group was forbidden to return to France for five years, and they were fined a total of US$81,700. Susan May was not convicted. Norton was released after 19 months while his wife served five months before her release on medical grounds. The couple were subject to a U.S. warrant on the gun smuggling charges and were granted asylum in Nicaragua. Central America and Cuba After bandits broke into his house in Managua, he was able to find a gun and shot and killed one of the robbers. He relocated to Cuba in the 1990s, but rapidly became disenchanted with life under Communism. He moved, this time to Mexico, and sought the help of his daughter and his first wife to bring him back into the United States. He met his family members in Tijuana, and they smuggled him back across the U.S. border. He settled in Santa Barbara, California, where he reportedly spent years worrying that the FBI would arrest him until a lawyer convinced him that he had nothing to worry about. He wrote a script, Exiled in America, based on his experiences, which was produced by Paul Leder. Death Norton died in Santa Barbara of a heart attack, aged 85, on October 1, 2010. He was survived by his second wife, Eleanor, as well as by two daughters and a son, writer-director Bill L. Norton. His first marriage, to the former Betty Conklin, had ended in divorce.

Early life Baroness () Elisabeth and her twin sister Doroth√©e were born on 16 January 1912 in T√ºbingen, W√ºrttemberg to Baron Othmar von Wangenheim-Winterstein and his wife, Baroness Maud von Falkenstein. Her family lived in Th√ºringia at Behringen Castle. Her mother died in childbirth in 1913, leaving a son, Jobst. As a young girl Elisabeth began training as a pianist in Hanover but was forced to end her studies, as the death of their mother left her widowed father in need of help on the family estate. Her education left her with a lifetime love of music, particularly Mozart, as well as a fondness for literature, which helped sustain her through difficult times. Marriage and issue On 5 October 1944 at Wartburg Castle, Elisabeth was married to Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach, the eldest son and heir of Wilhelm Ernst, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach, and his wife, Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen, Grand Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. They had three children: *Princess Elisabeth of Saxe- Weimar-Eisenach, Duchess of Saxony (born Burgellern bei Bamberg, 22 July 1945), married in Munich on 10 July 1981 to Mindert Diderik de Kant (born Leeuwarden, 6 August 1934). They divorced in 1983, without issue. *Prince Michael of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Duke of Saxony (born Bamberg, 15 November 1946) *Princess Beatrice-Maria of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Duchess of Saxony (born Bamberg, 11 March 1948), married in London on 9 December 1977 to Martin Charles Davidson (born London, 23 September 1940), and has a daughter, Bettina Davison. Because all titles have been banned in Germany since the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, Charles never succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach; from the death of Charles's father in 1923, he and Elisabeth were known as the Hereditary Grand Duke and Hereditary Grand Duchess. Charles served as the head of the House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach until his death in 1988. Just before giving birth to their first child, the couple were forced to flee eastern Germany in the face of the approaching Soviet Red Army. They stayed with Ernst II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, at Weikersheim Castle, but lost most of their extensive property and possessions; all that remained of their former fortune was a small car and a small number of personal possessions. A small part of their fortune (several million euros) was eventually recovered, as they were allowed to reclaim the property they lost from the Soviet occupancy through family lawyers and the German government; none of the family ever returned to Th√ºringia, however. Later life Elisabeth and Charles eventually separated, but were never officially divorced. By this point, their children were all married and living away from home; consequently, Elisabeth was alone much of the time later in her life. She lived quietly in Munich for the last fourteen years of her life to be near her daughter Princess Elisabeth. Unlike her \\"more glamorous\\" children, Elisabeth largely stayed out of headlines during her lifetime. Though her son remarked that Elisabeth was \\"a fighter\\" after she recovered from an accident, the doctors gave her very little chance of survival; she died on 15 March 2010 at the age of 98 in Munich. Her remains were interred at Wartburg Castle, where, according to her son, she had always had a very emotional bond and wanted it to be her final resting place.

The Swarm was the world's second Wing Coaster model designed by Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard and the only one located in the United Kingdom. Construction commenced in May 2011, and the coaster opened on 15 March 2012. From 2013 to 2015, the last two rows of each train faced backwards, while the first five rows faced forward. This was removed in 2016, with all riders facing forward once again. The ride stands tall and features five inversions and a heavily-banked left turn. Riders experience speeds of up to and 4.5 times the force of gravity. A marketing campaign for the ride began eleven months before The Swarm opened to the public. It has generally been well-received, ranking highly amongst other roller coasters of its type. History=Planning and announcement In 2010, planning for The Swarm began behind closed doors. The ride was codenamed Project LC12 in the early process of its planning and construction. On 31 January 2011, Thorpe Park submitted a planning application for their 2012 ride to the Runnymede Borough Council. The website gave further information about the new ride's theme, that of an apocalyptic battle. Construction and opening At the time of the ride's announcement construction was already underway. The track for The Swarm was complete by 18 November 2011. Clearance testing started almost immediately; the first operational test run was completed on 17 January 2012. On 15 March 2012, The Swarm officially opened to the public. In January 2013, Thorpe Park announced that the last two rows on The Swarm would be rotated to face backwards for 2013, a first for a Wing Coaster. The park's tag line for this experience is 'THE SWARM- Brave It Backwards'. The park additionally announced that they were adding a damaged, mangled billboard, which the train travels through. In 2016 the seats were returned to all facing forwards. Characteristics=Location The Swarm is located on a reclaimed island adjacent to the Stealth roller coaster, with parts of the ride being built over water. A bridge links the core of Thorpe Park to an island which hosts the roller coaster station, merchandise outlet, a games zone and toilet buildings. Trains The Swarm features two 28-seat Bolliger & Mabillard Wing Coaster trains. Each train is made up of seven rows of four seats each. One pair of seats in each row is located on either side of the ride's track and slightly lower than the track, as with all Wing Coasters. The trains are themed to resemble alien-like drones (the ride's eponymous \\"Swarm\\"), with a number of red LED lights placed across the train. Theme The area is designed to appear as if it has been partially destroyed by explosions associated with a major disaster. The ride recreates the experience of flying through a crash scene and features a partially destroyed church, crashed aeroplane, upturned ambulance, half-submerged fire engine and a damaged helicopter. This is due to a swarm of semi-organic machines, mechanical creatures which you are invited to ride the wings of. File:Part of the swarms destroyed church.jpgPart of The Swarm's destroyed church File:View of firestruck theming.jpgA partially submerged fire engine in the area surrounding the ride File:The swarm, crashed plane, thorpe park, england.jpgThe crashed plane featured in the ride File:The swarm station with overturned police van.jpgThe overturned police van (also the ride's control centre). Ride experience Track layout The roller coaster begins in the station, which is built to look like a partially destroyed church, and climbs up a chain lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the track twists 180 degrees anticlockwise, so that riders are upside down, before plunging down the world's first dive drop element. The train then proceeds to dive under the wing of a wrecked plane and into a zero-g roll above the ground before passing through a billboard, immediately following which the on-ride photo is taken. It then enters an inclined loop in height. It then enters a turnaround with a wrecked helicopter with slow-spinning rotor blades in the centre. This is followed by a corkscrew, which passes through the inclined loop. Upon leaving the corkscrew, the train curves past a crashed fire engine with water and fire effects and proceeds through a keyhole: a partly destroyed church tower. The ride then flies over the station and enters into a last inline twist before a mid-course brake run. Following this, the train makes a banked left-hand turn into the final brakes. The train then goes back into the station. The ride previously featured an on-ride video camera, filming riders and allowing the purchase of a DVD afterwards; this was removed sometime in 2016.The inclined loop and corkscrew featured in the ride Marketing In late April 2011, Thorpe Park began an advertising campaign for LC12 consisting of \\"The end is coming\\" posters in the park and a teaser website, LC12.net. The LC12.net website featured a brief description hinting at the possible theme of the ride alongside a countdown until 1 August 2011. As the date of the ride's announcement approached, Thorpe Park released a video via Facebook stating that \\"WAR is coming\\". On 25 January 2012, it was reported that an incident occurred when testing The Swarm. Limbs of test dummies were broken off when the ride passed an object that was located too close to the track. The Daily Mail suggested that the incident might have been a publicity stunt. In March 2012, Thorpe Park announced it had contracted the band You Me at Six to create the world's first roller coaster single for the launch of The Swarm. The song, \\"The Swarm\\", was released on iTunes on 18 March 2012, a few days after the opening of the roller coaster. The song entered the UK Singles Charts at number 23. Reception The Swarm received mixed responses in its opening season. The park declared the attraction a commercial disappointment in its following years, after disappointing guest attendance to the park; this partially led to the brief \\"Brave it backwards\\" feature in 2013. Blogger Nick Sim of \\"Theme Park Tourist\\" praised the attraction, saying that it packs \\"a number of incredible elements into its compact circuit\\". Sim stated the ride had \\"fallen just short of our sky-high expectations\\" mainly because of \\"its short ride time\\". He rated the ride 4 out of 5. Joanna Churchill of the Daily Mirror gave a review of the backwards ride, stating that it is \\"a whole new adrenaline-pumped experience that is simply not for the faint-hearted\\". Churchill stated that her \\"blood pressure and heart rate went through the roof\\", but \\"there was barely time to process what was happening before we were back on terra firma\\". In Mitch Hawker's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll, The Swarm debuted at position 68 out of the 365 roller coasters in the poll. When compared with other Wing Coasters debuting in the 2012 poll, The Swarm performed fairly well; X-Flight at Six Flags Great America ranked 58, Wild Eagle at Dollywood ranked 87, and Raptor at Gardaland ranked 113. It did not place in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but made its first appearance in 2015 ranked at 30. Despite the positive reviews, however, The Swarm failed to increase attendance. Park gate figures fell by 200,000 following the addition of the coaster. The park itself, as well as many others, have blamed the park's branding from 2009 to 2012 as the issue.

This was first seen on the Suzuki GT750, GT550, and GT380 motorcycles. In an effort to reduce CO, HC, and NOx emissions, the EPIC (Exhaust Port Ignition Cleaner) system was also installed.Ozeki, Suzuki Story, pp. 58‚Äì59 Applications: * 1971.05-1973.07 Suzuki Fronte LC10 W * 1971.09-1976 Suzuki Fronte Coup√© * 1973-1976.05 Suzuki Fronte LC20 LC50 A bored-out version of the air-cooled LC10, called the LC50 in reference to its near half-litre displacement (actually ) appeared in January 1969.Ozeki, Suzuki Story, p. 57 In street applications, this engine was only for export, and was only ever made with air cooling. Like its smaller brethren, the LC50 breathed through triple carburettors. Water-cooled triples were built for racing purposes, producing at 9,000 rpm. These took part in the JAF Grand Prix Formula Junior class as well as \\"MR\\" (Minicar Racing) meets.

The watercooled engine's bore was , while retaining the stroke. Sometime between 1973 and 1976 Suzuki had changed their system of naming engines, so this engine became the T4A. This meant that it was the first (\\"A\\") engine with a 0.4-litre displacement. The T4A was fairly short-lived (only used in the Fronte 7-S for a little over two years), and was soon replaced by an unrelated \\"full size\\" (550 cc) engine called the T5A/T5B. The emissions strangled T4A put out at 4,500 rpm in its final \\"TC53\\" form: specific power was 54% of what a 1972 Fronte GT had managed. * 1976.05-1977.10 Suzuki Fronte 7-S SS10/SS12 See also *List of Suzuki engines References LC10 Category:Two-stroke gasoline engines Category:Inline-three engines Category:Gasoline engines by model ","title":"Suzuki LC10 engine"},{"id":"29148728","text":"LC9, LC-9, or LC/9 may refer to: * LC9, a rocket launch pad at the And√∏ya Rocket Range, Norway * Buick V6 LC9, an engine made by General Motors from 1978 to 1979 * Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 9, a rocket launch pad in Florida * LC9 (band), a South Korean boy group * Ruger LC9, a semi-automatic pistol * LC9 Vortec 5300, a small-block engine made by General Motors ","title":"LC9"},{"id":"29148729","text":"Introducing the 3 Sounds is the debut album by jazz group The Three Sounds featuring performances recorded in 1958 and released on the Blue Note label.Blue Note discography accessed October 11, 2010 The CD reissue includes five bonus tracks and one alternate take originally issued in Japan as Introducing the 3 Sounds Volume 2.

He served with distinction early in the war at the battles of Fort Donelson and Shiloh.Daniel p.178 He is commonly referred to as \\"C. Carrol Marsh\\" in official reports.Official Records Early life Charles Carroll Marsh was born in Oswego, New York in 1829. In 1853 he moved to Chicago, Illinois to study law. The legal profession was too crowded for Marsh and his studies lasted only a year before pursuing other business ventures. He joined the Chicago Light Guard becoming captain in that organization. Civil War=Early Battles Due to the reputation of the Chicago Light Guard, Captain Marsh was called to Springfield, Illinois at the outset of the Civil War. Eager to offer his services, he responded quickly and was given command of the 20th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment.Wilson p. 45 Colonel Marsh and his command were transported to Cape Girardeau, Missouri and attached to Colonel Joseph B. Plummer's command at the Battle of Fredericktown. Fort Donelson Position of Marsh (WHL Wallace's Brigade) on the morning of February 15Colonel Marsh and the 20th were stationed at Bird's Point, Missouri until joining Ulysses S. Grant's expedition to Fort Henry as a part of W. H. L. Wallace's 2nd Brigade in John A. McClernand's 1st Division. At the battle of Fort Donelson Marsh was positioned on the right of the Union lines. McClernand's entire division was hit hard during the Confederate breakout attempt on February 15. Despite being hard pressed Marsh managed a counterattack which momentarily checked Simon B. Buckner's division and saved an Illinois artillery battery from capture.Gott p.202 Shiloh Shiloh Church on both days of the battle Following the victory at Fort Donelson, General Ulysses S. Grant was thrust into the public eye and at the same came under attack from department commander Henry W. Halleck. During this time Colonel Marsh and others presented Grant with an ivory-handled sword. Marsh took the occasion to publicly profess his confidence in General Grant and denounced the \\"jealousy caused by his recent success\\".Daniel p.55 He assumed command of the 2nd Brigade when recently promoted Brig. Gen. W.H.L. Wallace took command of the 2nd Division. On the morning of April 6, 1862 messengers managed to alert Colonel Abraham M. Hare of the 1st Brigade that a battle was underway but news of the fighting had not reached Colonel Marsh until a cannonball soared through his brigade's camp.Daniel p.177 Early in the fighting Marsh's brigade was forced into a disorderly retreat until he and General McClernand managed to rally units of the 1st Division behind Shiloh Church. Marsh then led a counterattack which managed to overrun a Confederate battery but proved costly. Once again Marsh was forced to withdraw his dwindling command. Around 5:00pm he made a final stand supported by remnants of three other brigades.Daniel p.242 On April 7 he led his brigade in recapturing lost ground in the vicinity of Shiloh Church where he had seen action the day before. Post Shiloh and Resignation Following the battle of Shiloh Colonel Marsh was transferred to command the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division stationed at Jackson, Mississippi. He was appointed Brigadier General of U.S. Volunteers dated November 29, 1862, though his appointment was later withdrawn. He was transferred to command the 1st Brigade in John A. Logan's 3rd Division of the XVII Corps in the opening stages of Grant's First Vicksburg Campaign. Colonel Marsh resigned on April 22, 1863. Later lifeSources * Daniel, Larry J.

Her best-known piece, the full-colour map of the Flanaess that accompanied the 1980 folio edition of the World of Greyhawk by Gary Gygax, was used as the basis of all subsequent Greyhawk publications and maps until Greyhawk publications were discontinued by Wizards of the Coast in 2008. Early life DARLENE, the third of seven children, grew up on a farm near Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Her mother was an artist, and DARLENE followed in her footsteps, becoming a member of the Geneva Lake Arts Association at a young age. She made her first professional gallery sale before the age of 16. After graduating from Elkhorn High School in 1972, she enrolled at Beloit College and majored in art. In 1975, as part of her studies, she spent a term in London, England, where she also studied calligraphy. She graduated cum laude in 1976 with a B.A. in Studio Art, and moved to Lake Geneva, where she eked out a living as a graphic artist by holding down three part-time jobs simultaneously. In 1979, she helped co-found The Wisconsin Calligrapher‚Äôs Guild and served as the first editor of its newsletter. Freelance fantasy artist In 1977, Mike Carr, one of the first employees of TSR, met DARLENE, when he went to a local graphics shop to order brochures for Gen Con. He and DARLENE started dating, and Carr used his influence at TSR to get her some freelance art assignments. One of her first assignments was to design and produce an outdoor sign for TSR's building in Lake Geneva. She made the sign in the shape of a medieval shield and painted a dragon on one side and the TSR logo on the reverse.DARLENE: ‚ÄúAmong the first jobs I was given to do was to design and produce an outdoor sign for TSR's Williams Street building. I made the sign in the shape of a shield and painted The Dragon on one side and TSR on the other.‚Äù In 1979 and 1980, she received many freelance art and calligraphy assignments, including artwork for: * Dungeon Master's Guide *Deities & Demigods *an accessory book called The Rogues Gallery. * cover art for the adventure In Search of the Unknown Map of the Flanaess In 1980, she was given the opportunity to create the piece of art for which she is best known, the full-colour map of the Flanaess that accompanied Gary Gygax‚Äôs folio edition of the World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting. Gygax was busy transforming his home D&D; campaign called ‚ÄùGreyhawk‚Äù into a publishable form. His long-range plan‚Äìleft incomplete when he was ousted from TSR in 1985‚Äìwas to create an entire fantasy world; however when he asked TSR's printing house about the maximum size of paper they could handle, the answer was just 34\\" x 22\\" (86 cm x 56 cm). He found that, using the scale he desired, he could only fit the northeast corner of one continent on two of those sheets.Gygax: \\"When I was asked to create a campaign setting for TSR to market, I did a new and compact \\"world\\"--that only in part, of course, as that was all I could fit onto the two maps allowed. So that became the World of Greyhawk.\\" Gygax: \\"I found out the maximum map size TSR could produce, got the go-ahead for two maps of that size, then sat down for a couple of weeks and hand-drew the whole thing. After the maps were done and the features shown were named, I wrote up brief information of the features and states. Much of the information was drawn from my own personal world, but altered to fit the new one depicted on the maps.\\" He placed the city and castle of Greyhawk roughly in the centre of the map, in an area that would have about the same temperate climate as his home in Lake Geneva, and made a rough sketch of the rest of the map, an area he called ‚Äúthe Flanaess‚Äù. DARLENE was given the assignment of developing a full color map on a hex grid from Gygax's prototype map. Jasmine Shortly before World of Greyhawk was published, DARLENE created the cover art for Dragon magazine issue 37. This issue also carried the first episode of ‚ÄúJasmine‚Äù, her color comic strip about a princess whose realm was coveted by an evil prince. The strip ran for 12 issues before being cancelled for not appealing to the magazine's mostly male readers. DARLENE tried to a promote a petition at Origins '81 to have the comic strip brought back, but it gathered few signatures. Shortly after this, she designed and produced the card game Jasmine: The Battle for the Mid-Realm. Although reviews in Gameplay and The Dragon were good‚ÄîMerle Rasmussen wrote ‚ÄúJasmine incorporates a few old ideas with many new ones to create a fresh approach in card gaming‚Äù‚Äîan expected expansion deck never materialized. Further freelance assignments She continued to take assignments from TSR, and between 1981 and 1984, her work appeared in White Plume Mountain, Investigation of Hydell, Monster Cards Set 3, the boxed set of the updated and expanded World of Greyhawk Fantasy Setting, and Legends & Lore. Darlene drew the cover art for the KABAL role-playing game (1982). Post-fantasy career In 1984, she legally changed her name to just DARLENE, dropping her surname Pekul as well as legally changing the typography of her name to a capital and small capitals. That same year, she left the world of fantasy artwork to enroll in Graphic Design at Indiana University, and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in 1987. After graduation, she and her first husband, Michael Price, moved to Plainville, Connecticut, where she was a freelance graphic artist and taught calligraphy and art classes. She developed an interest in Native American spirituality and art, and later an interest in Egyptian art. She briefly returned to the fantasy art world in 2003, when she was approached by Gary Gygax to again create maps for a project of his. When Gygax had been ousted from TSR in 1985, he had lost creative rights to all of his published Greyhawk material. However, he still had all of his own notes from his Greyhawk home campaign, and decided to publish details of the original castle and city in six volumes.Gygax: \\"I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope.\\" Since Wizards of the Coast (WotC) still owned the rights to the name Greyhawk, Gygax changed the name of the castle to Castle Zagyg‚Äîthe reverse homophone of his own name. Gygax also changed the name of the nearby city to \\"Yggsburgh\\", a play on his initials E.G.G. In 2005, Troll Lord Games published Volume I, Castle Zagyg: Yggsburgh. This 256-page hardcover book contained details of Gygax's original city, its personalities and politics, as well as a two-part fold out map of the area rendered by DARLENE. Personal life After the end of her first marriage, DARLENE began a relationship with occult author Vincent Bridges, and for many years they lived in Mount Gilead, North Carolina. Together they founded Aethyrea Books and published several books about the occult. After over twenty years in Mount Gilead, Bridges moved to Prague so that he could produce a play, \\"The Donkey and the Cradle\\", in a historic residence of occultist Edward Kelley, but he died on July 25, 2014, the very day the play was to premiere. Legacy The map DARLENE had created for the original World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting in 1980 continued to be the basis of all future Greyhawk maps, adventures and campaigns created by both TSR and WotC for the next 38 years‚Äîincluding the massively shared Living Greyhawk campaign (2000‚Äì2008). However, when Wizards of the Coast introduced the fourth edition of D&D; in 2008, publication of new Greyhawk material was discontinued.
