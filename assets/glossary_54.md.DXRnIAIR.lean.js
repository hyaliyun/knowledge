He fought in several conflicts, including World War One, Polish- Czechoslovak War, Polish-Ukrainian War, Polish-Soviet War and the Invasion of Poland. Furthermore, Skwarczynski was a freemason, member of a Masonic Lodge in Wilno. Stanis≈Çaw Skwarczy≈Ñski Skwarczynski was born on 17 November 1888 in the village of Wierzchnia, Kalusz County, Austrian Galicia. He studied architecture at Lwow Polytechnic, and was an active member of Polish paramilitary organizations, such as the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Association. In 1914, he joined Polish Legions in World War I. Appointed to the post of battalion commandant of 1st Legions Infantry Regiment, he was on 15 June 1915 promoted to the rank of Poruchik. After the Oath crisis, Skwarczynski was forced to join Austro-Hungarian Army, from which he deserted. In 1918 ‚Äì 1917, he was conspirational commandant of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Area of Polish Military Organisation. In November 1918, Skwarczynski joined Polish Army, and soon afterwards, he became commandant of 3rd Battalion of 28th Kaniow Rifles Regiment. Together with his unit, he briefly fought against Czechoslovak forces in Cieszyn Silesia, to be transferred to Eastern Galicia, where Polish-Ukrainian conflict took place in late 1918 and 1919. On 15 April 1920 Skwarczynski was named commandant of 2nd Battalion of 5th Legions Infantry Regiment. During the war with Soviet Union, he commanded 5th Legions Infantry Regiment, remaining in this post until 1926. On 14 February 1929 he was appointed commandant of 3rd Legions Infantry Division, stationed in Zamosc. On 25 October 1930 Skwarczynski was appointed to the prestigious post of commandant of elite 1st Legions Infantry Division, stationed in Wilno. On 1 January 1931 Skwarczynski was promoted to General brygady. In the late 1930s, he was actively involved in politics, as a supporter of the Sanacja movement. In 1938‚Äì39, he was the leader of Camp of National Unity, and in 1938 he officially opened the Sejm (Parliament]) of Poland. In late August 1939, Skwarczynski returned to active military service, and was appointed commandant of the so-called Intervention Corps (Korpus Interwencyjny), which was sent to the Polish Corridor, with the task to counter a possible German action in the Free City of Danzig. After a short time he was appointed commandant of Operational Group Wyszkow, but did not take this post. Instead, he became commandant of rear units of southern group of Prusy Army. Skwarczynski‚Äôs leadership in the Invasion of Poland was a complete failure. His forces were routed by the Wehrmacht in the Battle of Radom, after which he ordered 12th Infantry Division to disperse and abandon its heavy equipment, including 50 cannons. Together with a number of soldiers, he managed to cross the Vistula, and join the units which moved southwards, to the Romanian Bridgehead. Captured by the Germans during the Battle of Tomaszow Lubelski, he was sent to Oflag Dorsten, where he remained until liberation. In April 1945, he went to London, and remained in exile until his death. After the war, Skwarczynski decided to stay away from the political and social life of the Polish community of Great Britain. He died in London on 8 August 1981 and was buried at Elmers End Cemetery.

Personal life  Pierce Brown grew up in seven different states. His mother, Colleen Brown, was the President and CEO of Fisher Communications and the Chairman of American Apparel's Board of Directors. His father, Guy Brown, is a former local banker. Brown graduated from Pepperdine University, where he majored in political science and economics. After graduation, he worked a variety of jobs in politics and startup tech companies. Brown was working for the NBC Page Program in Burbank, California and living in his former political science professor's garage when he sold Red Rising in 2012.  Career  Brown wrote six novels and faced rejection from over 120 agents before selling Red Rising. He wrote the novel in two months above his parents' garage in Seattle, Washington. Red Rising, published in 2014, received widespread positive reviews, and hit #20 on The New York Times Best Seller list. The 2015 sequel, Golden Son, hit #6 on the same list and was equally praised by critics. In 2016, Morning Star reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list in Adult Hardcover, Digital Book and cumulative. It also reached #1 on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list. In February 2014, shortly after the release of Red Rising, Universal Pictures acquired the rights for a film adaptation in a 7-figure auction. Marc Forster is set to direct, with Brown writing the screenplay. Brown told Entertainment Weekly that after completing the original trilogy, \\"I took a meager little break, mostly to stretch my screenwriting muscles.\\" As of February 2016, the film was still in development, with Brown having written the first two drafts. He said in March 2016, \\"I have written the first two drafts of the film and now we're on the third. Hopefully it will be greenlit this year. The vision from the film makers is Lawrence of Arabia in space', which is terribly exciting for me as it's my favorite film.\\" The rights eventually reverted back to Brown, and in January 2018 he said he was developing Red Rising as a television series. Brown confirmed in October 2018 that the project had a director and a showrunner, and added that the film rights had also been resold to an unspecified studio. Brown announced a sequel trilogy in February 2016, to begin with the novel Iron Gold in August 2017. A prequel comic book series, Red Rising: Sons of Ares, debuted in May 2017. Brown said of his writing: The author has said that his writing has been \\"hugely\\" influenced by his readers' feedback, explaining: Brown also noted the popularity of his novels among the LGBT community, saying \\"It's amazing that they have found a home in these books ...

The sister series to Channel 4's Cucumber and E4's Banana, Tofu is a documentary series that focuses on a range of sex attitudes in the twenty-first century from the viewpoint of everyday people. Like Cucumber and Banana, the name of the series refers to the same urological scale of hardness of the male erection which starts at tofu, goes through peeled banana and ends at cucumber from a European study that inspired Davies. Development Tofu was commissioned in 2013 as a sister show to Davies' dramas Cucumber and Banana. In development since 2006, Cucumber was announced along with companion series Banana, and web series Tofu in November 2013. The titles of all three shows come from a scientific study into the male erection which divided the hardness of the men's erections into a hardness scale consisting of tofu, peeled banana, banana, and cucumber; upon reading the study, Davies remarked that \\"right there and then, I knew I had my drama\\". Tofu is a food made by coagulating soy milk and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks in gradations of soft, firm, or extra firm. Described by the channel as an \\"anarchic and entertaining look at sex\\", Tofu explores issues that arise in Cucumber and Banana through interviews with actors for both shows and the public, such as one-night stands organised through apps like Grindr and sexual taboos. Requests for participants were issued in July 2014 and were open to anyone over eighteen, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or sexual history; interested parties were asked to send a 90-second video to producers Red Production Company describing their \\"best sexcapade\\". Episodes Journalist and YouTuber Benjamin Cook hosts everyday people discussing a variety of attitudes towards sex. I'm With Geek points out that although not tied to the narrative of Cucumber and Banana, the interviewees include the show's cast and the program discusses sex \\"with as much frankness as the show depicts it\\". Tofu offers an \\"honest, non-judgmental and entertaining view of sex and sexuality in the same way that Cook‚Äôs 'Becoming Youtube' did for the Youtube community.\\" Reception As a documentary series, Tofu is seen as the odd-one-out of the triptych. Reviewing the first episode, Oli Dowdeswell of SoSoGay described the show as \\"an interesting concept, but one that doesn't work 100% of the time\\". Dowdeswell praised the interview segments of the episode, but was less positive about the dramatised \\"mini-Black Mirror\\" vignette, which he felt was out of place in a documentary series. Sam Wollaston in The Guardian felt that even though the shows were \\"Gloriously, explicitly, triumphantly, cucumberly. Gay to the core.\\" he didn't feel left out or see the subjects irrelevant; he also found Tofu \\"cum-in-your-face frank\\".

As a very highly regarded American artist of the early 20th century by his peers (including Maurice Sterne, Waldo Pierce, Edward Bruce, Marcel Sauvage and Michel Georges-Michel of Paris, among others), his style can be identified with the American expressionist movement.Hellman, George S., \\"To The Editor of Art Digest‚Äù, Art Digest, Oct. 1930 Clivette is also known to be one of several artists who most defined the Ashcan realism period in New York at that time. Clivette was demonstrated artistic talent painting in a free flowing manner rarely painting over a line twice. During the 1920s his style evolved as he moved from realism toward expressionism eventually moving on to figurative and the abstract. Early life Clivette was born in 1868 in Portage, Wisconsin but grew up in the Wyoming Territory. In this teens he left to participate in a Wild West show which toured the Northwest US and during his time in it he was able to display his skills as an acrobat, juggler and amateur magician. He honed these skills into what would later be a Vaudeville touring show. Clivette moved to Seattle then San Francisco in the late 1880s. He drew quick sketches in San Francisco then toured the United States with the Orpheum Circuit from 1891-1900 . Clivette headed across the pond to Europe and while there soaked in the traditional European art styles. Clivette was a student of Auguste Rodin from 1889-1890 and even painted a portrait of Auguste Rodin said to be the greatest of all portraits of the sculptor.Hellman, George S.; Sterne, Maurice; New Gallery (New York, N.Y.), \\"Clivette : exhibition of paintings January 11 to 29, 1927\\", the New Gallery 600 Madison Ave., New York, 1927. He came back from the trips much wiser and secured a place in the New York City art community. Clivette modeled himself with Ashcan School artists (including Robert Henri) utilizing realist subjects. Clivette used the Chiaroscuro style in both light and dark juxtapositions and loose but forceful brushwork. These were similar to Robert Henri and other realist painters. Clivette was well known for his Vamp series which portray Show Business ladies in the garish Burlesque attire. This technique links him and the Ashcan school. Contrasting these Vamp paintings Clivette painted numerous American Indian portraits. Clivette inevitably moved away from this realistic look to a more distorted fashion in the vein of Chaim Soutine. Over time he drifted away from realism toward expressionism. His later work turned toward figurativism, and eventually becoming abstract. Career Clivette created his expressionist works painting with confidence with many strokes in succession; he utilized his skills he learned as an acrobat to move the brushes with precision. In his grander works, the marks looked like they were created using his whole body. This style was one of his greatest strengths. Over time other New York artists such as Franz Kline, picked up on this new type of performance painting to make their mark. During the 1920s New York art locale, Clivette was respected and his art was well received. George S. Hellman writes that Clivette was the greatest American Painter ever after seeing Clivette's \\"Outriding the Blizzard\\" painting.Vassar Miscellany News, \\"Clivette Exhibition Visits Vassar: Works of Latest Find in Art World are Shown in Taylor Hall\\", Volume XI, Number 27, 12 February 1927 Hellman was so convinced of Clivette's genius that he purchased a number of paintings from him and encouraged other accomplished New York painters -- Maurice Sterne, Paul Manship, Edward Bruce -- to purchase paintings from Clivette as well. Sterne himself was amazed at this unknown artist who he thought painted self-portraits similarly to Paul Cezanne but with less controlHellman, George S.; Sterne, Maurice; New Gallery (New York, N.Y.), \\"Clivette : exhibition of paintings January 11 to 29, 1927\\", the New Gallery 600 Madison Ave., New York, 1927 Clivette's work was frequently exhibited during the 1920s from Los Angeles‚ÄúClivette the Eternalist‚Äù, Los Angeles Times, Aug. 30, 1931 to Paris,Harris, Ruth Green, ‚ÄúNow on Exhibition in Paris‚Äù, New York Times, July 24, 1927‚ÄúClivette in Paris‚Äù, Art Digest, Aug. 1927 and New York in-between ‚ÄúTwo New Canvases by Clivette at Palace‚Äù, San Francisco Examiner, Feb. 19, 1928‚ÄúClivette Paintings Now on Exhibition‚Äù, New York Enquirer, April 23, 1933 To this point is a reference from Henry Rankin Poore's book \\"Modern Art, Why, What and How\\" which talks about Clivette's impact including this Paris show. He begins, \\"Although France may claim the credit of introducing modern art to the world it is not generally known that before Paul C√©zanne had sponsored cubism and Henri Matisse freedom, an American citizen was working out kindred theories. Merton Clivette, although of distant French extraction, has been Americanized through generations since 1630.\\" Poore, Henry Rankin, ‚ÄúModern Art, Why, What and How‚Äù, G.P. Putnam's Sons The Knickerbocker Press, 1931 Additionally it notes, \\"Only recently an invitation came for a large exhibition of his works in Paris, and had those pictures been seen there when first produced, Henri Matisse would have had to acknowledge that his idea had already been preempted. The French Government, through its Director of Fine Arts, selected an example from this exhibition which is destined for Luxembourg. The critical press of Paris extolled the newcomer from across the sea. It is quite proper then that the makers of Modern Art should move up and accord Clivette a place beside them.\\" Clivette joins six other painters as the only American given a special article in the book, \\"Selections from the Collection of George S. Hellman\\", along with Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Derain, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Selected paintings include Rushing Waters, Flowers in a Pot, Still Life, Walt Whitman, Indian in a Canoe, Toucan, Seascape, Small Seascape, and Sunset among others.Hellman, George S., \\"Selections from the Collection of George S.

SRG Partnership designed it in 1987, and since then, the carpet has received much media attention. In 2013, the Port of Portland announced the carpet's replacement with a new pattern conceptualized by the Portland-based firm Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. The announcement generated a social media \\"phenomenon\\" and gained attention from local and national news outlets. Removal of the original carpet began in January 2015, with the airport recycling worn portions and making remaining pieces available for sale by local retail vendors. In 2015 Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard released his first PDX carpet colorway on the Adidas D Lillard 1 sneaker. In 2016, Lillard released the colorway on the D Lillard 2, also inspired by the carpet. Background The original carpet, pictured at Concourse D in 2007, was designed by SRG Architects in 1987. To reduce the amount of noise created by people walking across hard terminal floors, the Port of Portland contracted SRG Partnership to design new carpet for PDX in 1987. The SRG principal and co-designer of the carpet, John Schleuning, visited several airports before deciding what to create for the carpet at Portland International Airport. SRG steered away from the earth tones traditionally used by airports in the 1980s, incorporating blue and green into their design early on and hoping to evoke \\"northwest to the core.\\" Its pattern featured geometric shapes on a teal background, an abstract depiction of the intersecting north and south runways seen by air traffic controllers from the airport's tower at night. Several acres of the carpet were installed by the early 1990s. Over time, the carpet gained a cult following. Multiple social media accounts were dedicated to it and more than 20,000 pictures were posted to its official Instagram hashtag, #pdxcarpet. Airport visitors often took pictures of their feet on the carpet. The original carpet design received a positive reception by Portland residents and airport visitors, eventually reaching \\"local icon\\" status. Its pattern was used on a variety of products, including bicycle helmets, socks and T-shirts. In 2013, Portland Monthly published \\"Ode on a Carpet\\", a poem inspired by T. S. Eliot's \\"The Hollow Men\\" (1925). In September 2014, PDX installed an collage made of the carpet.  Replacement  Old (left) and new (right) carpet designs A $13 million replacement of the airport's carpet was announced in 2013, sparking social media attention that was picked up by local and national media outlets. The Port of Portland received a large number of comments from local residents who were concerned about the original carpet's future. Annie Linstrom, a spokesperson for the port district, confirmed they were investigating recycling options and considering giving away portions to locals as keepsakes. She also said that the Port of Portland \\"understand[s] that people have an emotional connection to the carpet.\\" In December 2013, Portland Monthly published a preview of the redesign, which was conceptualized by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects of Portland.

In 1884 built in Moorish style, the oldest Synagogue of Z√ºrich also houses the prayer and school house of Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Z√ºrich (ICZ) which was founded in 1862. ICZ is a unified Jewish community having about 2,500 members, and thus the largest Jewish community in Switzerland, which since 2007 in the Canton of Z√ºrich is recognized as a denomination, i.e. ICZ has the same legal state as the Christian denomiations. In the synagogue, the community celebrates the daily Minyan and Shabbat and holiday services. The synagogue is a cultural heritage of national importance in Switzerland.  Location  The synagoge is located at L√∂wenstrasse 10, between Bahnhofstrasse and Schanzengrabens in the City district of Z√ºrich, between L√∂wenplatz (Z√ºrich Trams 3 and 14) and Sihlporte (Trams 2 and 9). The Synagogue was built outside of the Baroque town wall those very last remains were broken in the 1900s, previously the Celtic-Roman Turicum, at the area being then called Aussersihl, meaning that it was outside of the medieval city at the former Sihl river delta.  History  = Medieval synagogue in Z√ºrich = Synagogengasse, Neumarkt, Z√ºrich In 2002 the building Froschaugasse 4 in the historical Neumarkt quarter was the location of archeological excavations. The former building Zur Judenschule (\\"Jewish school\\") was named so to the 18th century becaused it housed the European High Middle Ages synagogue of Z√ºrich. In 1363 it was called \\"Judenschuol\\" (a medieval term in Z√ºrich for a Synagogue), and some remains of the interior structure date before 1423 respectively 1349, when the Jewish citizens had to leave Z√ºrich, and the synagogue was repealed. Obscured by later layers of plaster, a small remnant of the adornment was found on occasion of the surveys, including fragments of a wall painting from the 14th century. Jewish residents having \\"Husroeichi\\" (an old Swiss-German term meaning a house with a separate chimney) were allowed on 25 February 1352 to live in Z√ºrich, and they were secured by the town law, but there were some restrictions and additions, namely related to testimony, and loans and pawnbroking. On 2 November 1383 the Jewish citizens of Z√ºrich were allowed by Heinrich, Bishop of Konstanz, on request of the city council of Z√ºrich to renew the Synagogue and the cemetery, under the reserve that exclusively Jews may be buried who resided (namely Burgrecht) in Z√ºrich. At the location of the former synagogue, a plaque was mounted towards Synagogengasse and Grimmenturm; the former Synagogue served as a storeroom, now a bookstore, and was never re-used as a synagogue. The medieval synagogue room was located on the ground floor of the rear component of the building Froschaugasse 4. By numerous alterations in the following centuries, however, much of the medieval building stock disappeared. The east facade was rebuilt, the ground was laid at a deeper level, and doors and windows got their present shape in the 20th century. Only a small remnant of the late medieval room ornaments are preserved, namely the wall painting fragments from the 14th century in the form of leaf tendrils in red and black color. The medieval building Froschaugasse 4 probably housed the synagogue in the 13th century, and as documented before the persecution of the Jewish community in the years of the plague around 1349 AD. = Expulsion from the city's republic of Z√ºrich (1423) = After the pogrom of 1349, the building Froschaugassee has not been used for some time (at least 1357‚Äì1368), and from 1370 to 1377 Christians lived in the house. Shortly before 1380, Jewish families lived again in the building, and the building was used for worship. The surviving Jewish citizens of the 1349 pogrom, were expelled indefinitely from the city in 1423. Thereafter, the property probably was used from 1455 as an accommodation building, and the Jewish citizens were forbidden to live in the city and in the canton Z√ºrich to 1850, even in the whole area of the today's Switzerland; excluded the two communities in Endingen and Lengnau in the Surb Valley. = Establishment of a new community in Z√ºrich (1850) = as seen from Uraniastrasse upright upright upright Among others, Jewish citizens from Endingen and Lengnau, 80 Jewish women, children and men in all, were allowed by the authorities to settle in the whole territory of the Canton of Zurich in 1850, and in 1862 only 175 people, including 100 in the Z√ºrich district. After the repeal of the majority of the legal restrictions on Jewish citizens on 3 March 1862, on 29 March 1862 the Israelitischer Kultusverein (Jewish society) was founded by 12 members in Z√ºrich, and in 1880 its name was changed in the present Israelitische Cultusgemeinde. The first Jewish community in the city of Z√ºrich within the past 438 years, exceptionally appreciated the support by the city authorities: As still lacked a suitable location for a Synagogue, \\"the most liberal city council provided the community an excellent nice place for a synagogue...\\" As the congregation did not have so much money to set up a temple and to get it into good condition, \\"...these noble fathers of the city even granted a loan of CHF 3,000 which is to be repaid in installments over five years. To a restoration of the Lord, kosher dining in a foreign land is allowed. Unpleasantly the fact that was often agitated here by a certain party against the commercial treaty with France, because in the same by the French [government] refusal's to otherwise not to sign the contract [comment: related to a trade relationship with the Swiss Federal authorities], when the emancipation of the Jews in Switzerland not was pronounced, the more the generous method of the Z√ºrich city council is to recognize.\\" In 1870 the Jewish community was increased to 37 families, and had increased again to 500 in 1912. In 1895 a religious turmoil occurred in the Z√ºrich community, and thus the Orthodox members wished to establish a separate temple. As early as in August 1877, the community tried to be accepted as a religious community in the canton of Z√ºrich ‚Äì the request was denied as \\"otherwise, other sects might apply for a state contribution.\\" Not as before 2007, the ICZ community got the cantonal acceptance by introducing the accordingly cantonal law on 1 January 2008.  Predecessor buildings of the present synagogue  A first prayer hall was established in autumn 1864 at an \\"excellent and beautiful place\\" in the medieval Jewish residential area Brunngasse at Neumarkt, Z√ºrich; 320 Swiss Francs (CHF) had to be paid annually to rent the room. For the equipment of the Betsaal (prayer room), the community received from the city a loan of CHF 3,000, repayable within five years. Due to the rapidly increasing number of members of the congregation, in 1867 a new prayer hall had to be established in the old Z√ºrich granary at the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke Limmat crossing at M√ºnsterhof, opposite of Limmatquai situated at the Fraum√ºnster cathedral in the medieval core of Z√ºrich. A rent of CHF 1,000 a year had to be paid, and in the prayer room for 8 women and 24 men a women's gallery also was established. On 26 February 1879 the community decided to build a synagogue, as the lease contract for the prayer hall in the old granary was terminated. In August 1880 the community set up the now third prayer hall in the old theater foyer, the present Obergericht building, and they moved again temporarily the community's prayer room in the building Brunngasse 15.  Inauguration of the synagogue on 16 September 1884  In his sermon Rabbi Dr. Hermann Engelbert mentioned at the end of his speech that \\"it would one day come a time when all people united by faith and love for a covenant of humanity itself, where the kingdom of truth, of light and peace will be carried out. The Israelite worship is determined to contribute to this end goals his part.\\" In the evening a banquet was held of approximately 270 people invited to the event, followed by a ball, under participation of officials of the government and Christian clergy of Z√ºrich.  Architecture  The construction of the current synagogue was realized in 1883/84 on a plot at L√∂wenstrasse. The foundation stone was laid on 6 July 1883, and the inauguration took place on 16 September 1884. The construction was carried out on the plans of the architects Chiodera and Tschudy, who designed a synagogue in the Moorish Revival style. The construction including land cost over then 200,000 Swiss Francs. The building of the synagogue was highly praised because of its acoustically good properties. The Moorish style imaginative inner decorations were not appreciated by all members of the 1880s community, but \\"thanks to the subdued lighting, the wealth colored jewelry was less exciting and distracting as expected.\\" The synagogue was originally set up for 200 men and 170 women seating capacity. Six years after the inauguration of the synagogue, the construction had to be converted for reasons of space, and so in 1890 additional seats were set up on the women's gallery. At the day of the inauguration, a harmonium was battled by the Orthodox members of the community, but it was removed. \\"The Board plans, without seeking approval from the community, to install s Harmonium in the synagogue, and indeed by the introduction of the same, the law-abiding fellow believers would not be ablel to perform their devotions in a synagogue provided with a harmonium.\\" In the following years, there has been repeatedly tensions between the secular and orthodox members, leading to cleavage of the Z√ºrich community. In 1897 a separate prayer room for the Orthodox members was created, next to the synagogue school building of the Jewish community. Since 1899 the construction of a larger synagogue was discussed, indeed the plans never were realized, but a community meeting discussed again in 1907: A new synagogue for the whole community having space for 800 to 1,000 seat places that replaced the synagogue, or a second synagogue ‚Äì the construction of the Orthodox synagogue at Freigutstrasse was executed in 1898, and so the Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft was established. On 15 September 1905 occurred the donation of a Torah scroll by Solomon Guggenheimer-Wyler, namely a Sefer Torah. Since it was the second donation of a Sefer Torah, it was noted that the \\"old Jewish sense is not yet died out.\\" The synagogue L√∂wenstrasse was renovated in 1936, 1952, and most recently in 1993, executed by the architects Bernard San, Michael Berlowitz and Ron Epstein, to grant restoration and renovation maintenance works.  Synagogenchor Z√ºrich  The Synagogenchor Z√ºrich today is composed of two dozen singers. Once a month, in the worship on the Sabbath morning and on occasion of the High Holi Days celebrations, as well as on interfaith events and concerts in Switzerland and abroad, the choir is active for over 100 years. Its members still practice and have a wide variety of religious orientations, in the cultural and religious context of the unified community ICZ, which maintains an open attitude and connecting to the internal Jewish discussion. The repertoire of the choir comprises about 60 mostly synagogue songs and accompaniments of Chasan-German, French, Polish and Russian composers of the 19th century and contemporary Swiss, American and Israeli musicians.  Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Z√ºrich (ICZ)  After the repeal of the majority legal restrictions on Jewish citizens, on 29 March 1862 Israelitische Kultusverein being the Jewish society was founded by 12 members, and in 1880 its name was changed in the present Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Z√ºrich. As of today, the unified Jewish community of Z√ºrich comprises about 2,500 members, being the largest Jewish community in Switzerland. Sigi Feigel and Daniel Jositsch are among the most prominent contemporary members of the community. It also provides a community center, a school, the Jewish cemetery, and a library of national importance. In 2009, the library that was founded in 1939, was awarded because of their special content as a Swiss heritage of national importance. Nevertheless, there were discussions in early 2014 about the future of this cultural heritage for financial reasons. The library of the largest Jewish community in Switzerland owns 50,000 volumes in Yiddish, Hebrew and German language. Among these are in addition to fiction valuable scientific work. The religious school was attended by 80 children in 1884, in 1894 there were 130 students, and 18 years later 230. Since 1898, the municipality has its own schoolhouse. The poor relief is governed since 1901.  Cemeteries  On 5 July 1865 the Jewish community, which at that time numbered nearly 30 members, mentioned the acquisition of a field for applying a cemetery. The cemeteries Unter Friesenberg and Oberer Friesenberg were established in 1865 and 1952.  Cultural heritage  The building of the Synagogue is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class B object of regional importance, the library of the Israelitische Cultusmeinde Z√ºrich (ICZ) in Enge at the Arboretum Z√ºrich even as a Class A object of national importance.

The game was distributed via Nintendo eShop, and took advantage of the Nintendo Network. A public beta test was being held in Japan from 3 September until 13 September, followed by the title's commercial release on 2 December 2015. The game also released internationally on 28 April 2016. As of 30 May 2019, the game‚Äôs servers have been shut down. Gameplay In-game screenshot At any given session, four players assume the roles of four characters - Sayuri, Dwayne, Victoria, and ShadowStalker - working cooperatively in missions to raid multi-roomed maps and recover treasure known as Relics. Players face against waves of various undead monsters, including giant bosses, in order to clear rooms, solve various puzzles, and move Relics to a certain point. Whilst recovering a Relic, one player taking the responsibility will be vulnerable, and has to depend on the team for protection. There is a play style system in defeating and defending from monsters called a \\"Multi-View Action System\\", including melee attacks, third- person shooting (trailing and over-the-shoulder), and first-person shooting. In the case one or more player falls, they can depend on their teammates for recovery, otherwise if all four players fall, then it is a mission failure. To clear any mission, the Relic must reach a certain point on the map. Or the players must defeat a boss. The game also features events like most free-to- play games, such as getting higher EXP for finishing missions for the first 2 weeks. Development The game was announced on 14 January 2015, under its tentative title Project Treasure, via that month's Nintendo Direct presentation in all major regions. Producer Harada was featured in a segment opening up about a game they were working on exclusively for Wii U. The game is a free-to-play online, four-player co-operative action title which any Wii U owner with a Nintendo Network ID could download and join in, provided their console is always online. According to Harada, \\"four players could work together to complete varied stages\\" and \\"[the] basic aim is to clear traps, rout enemies, and seize treasure.\\" Harada then concluded he was unable to disclose the game's official title or release date at that time, but he gave away the tentative title being \\"Project Treasure\\" and confirmed \\"[they are] working very hard on it.\\" The segment closed hinting the game was coming soon. Throughout the announcement segment, an array image featuring four different characters was teased, and no actual footage of the game was shown. On 31 May 2015, during the Japanese Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo released a gameplay trailer, featuring four unique characters fighting zombies in fast- paced melee combat within a labyrinth to find the treasure. The trailer concluded teasing that more information on the game would be revealed in the vague summer window of 2015. A day later, Nintendo of America released the English version of the same teaser trailer following their Nintendo Direct Micro. On 28 August 2015, Bandai Namco Entertainment officially launched the game's Japanese website and released a new trailer, revealing the game's final title as Lost Reavers, as well as many other details. The game is powered by Unreal Engine. Japanese Wii U owners were able to participate in a public beta run between 3 and 13 September, after which the title was released commercially on 2 December 2015. An open beta of the English version of the game was released on 14 April 2016, and ran until 26 April 2016. The game officially released world-wide on 28 April 2016.

One of several enterprises established by Law at the turn of the 20th century, the farm was known for its milk, butter, and cream and also produced other dairy products, American Beauty roses, bottled water, and print media. At its height, the farm was one of the largest dairy operations in the Northeastern United States, operating about with over 1,000 Jersey cattle. In 1907, the farm moved to Pine Plains in New York's Dutchess County, and it was purchased by New York banker Oakleigh Thorne in 1918, who developed it into an Angus cattle farm. After Thorne's death in 1948, the farm changed hands several times; in 1968 it became Stockbriar Farm, a beef feeding operation. Stockbriar sold the farmland to its current owners in 1979. The farm combined a practical American business model with the concept of a European country seat or manor, with cows being milked constantly, and with milk promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes, and shipped to stores in New York City each night. The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style. Briarcliff Farms was the original location for the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, established by the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture in conjunction with Walter Law. The school's purpose was to teach students in farming, gardening, poultry-keeping, and other agriculture-related skills. The school moved to a farm near Poughkeepsie in 1903, and the school building was run as a hotel for two years until it became Miss Knox's School. After the building burned down in 1912, Miss Knox's School was relocated several times; since 1954, the Knox School has been located in St. James, New York. History Illustration of James Stillman's Briarcliff Farm around 1886 James Stillman owned a small farm on Pleasantville Road since at least 1886. It was known as Briarcliff Farm after John David Ogilby's estate, Brier Cliff (itself named after Ogilby's family home in Ireland). In 1887 Stillman had a display at the Great Dairy and Cattle Show in New York City's Madison Square Garden, where he demonstrated setting milk, churning cream and making butter. In 1890, Walter Law began purchasing property in the present-day village of Briarcliff Manor as part of his desire for rest and recreation. That year, Law paid James Stillman $35,000 ($ in ) for his farm and renamed it Briarcliff Farms. In 1893, The New York Times reported that the 14th Duke of Veragua (a livestock farmer) and a large party visited the farm on the afternoon of June 16; at that time, the farm had about 330 cattle and 100 sheep. The party went from New York to Scarborough, proceeding by carriage to Briarcliff, and visited the farm's poultry yard, hennery and stables. After observing the farm's heifers and stallions, they went to the creamery to taste Briarcliff butter. The guests went to Law's Yonkers home, Hillcrest, for dinner before returning to New York. After the visit, the duke had said \\"Well, this is a perfect place. I am delighted with what I have seen.\\" Walter Law, founder of Briarcliff Farms and Manor In 1898 Law retired from the vice-presidency of W. & J. Sloane, moved with his family to the area and began devoting his time to agriculture. He rapidly added to his holdings, buying about forty parcels in less than ten years; by 1900, Law owned more than of Westchester County and was its largest individual landholder. Some previous owners became tenant farmers; Law received half of the hay and straw from a farm formerly owned by Jesse Bishop, and one-third of everything else. Law and Briarcliff Farms initially deepened the Pocantico River for , taking out rifts so the stream would flow and adjacent swamps would drain. Workers also cut rock and took out trees lining the swamps to reclaim land for farming. Law found the soil poor, since it had been farmed for a half-century. The fields were bare, and cows gave poor-quality milk: \\"I had to begin at the bottom and repair the waste of fifty years.\\" He improved the soil's fertility by arranging for manure from New York City streets and stables to be regularly brought to his farm; for four years, twenty carloads of manure a week were spread on the land. As a result, the farm's hay yield increased from two to five tons. Law also decided to improve the area's roads, giving them a base layer of large, closely packed stones and layers of top gravel. He developed his herd; at first the farm had weak cattle (many afflicted with tuberculosis) and \\"ordinary milk\\", but after Law's development the farm had strong cattle, healthy calves and an abundance of rich milk. Law hired Leonard Pearson (a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Pennsylvania) to check each cow every six months for tuberculosis and other diseases, exceeding New York City Board of Health standards. Although Law had little knowledge or experience of farming at first, he had enough money to reach his goal of maximizing his dairy farm's quality and output. Law's farm had 500 workers tending cattle, pigs, chickens, Thoroughbred horses, pheasants, peacocks and sheep at its peak. In 1900, when the US government asked Briarcliff Farms to exhibit its milk, butter and cream at Paris' Exposition Universelle, the farm submitted raw, pasteurized, and sterilized milk; however, according to the French, \\"There is no use sending these, for your fresh milk keeps fresh\\". The farm contributed to the USDA Bureau of Animal Industry and the New York State Commission to the Paris Exhibition's joint exhibit, winning gold medals for its milk, cream, and butter and a silver medal for social benefit or economy. Concerned that the farm's milk had preservatives, French authorities requested an affidavit that no chemicals were added. Photographs by the US government of Briarcliff Farms' barns, farmland, Law's mottoes and employees were displayed in the exposition's Palace of Social Economy and Congress. On September 2, 1901, the farm's dairy buildings were destroyed by fire. The cause of the fire (which was discovered in the dairy building's tower) was unknown, and the damage was covered by insurance. Law quickly arranged for a temporary dairy in a room of the electric plant which had a boiler for sterilization; by the afternoon, milk was processed as usual. A larger dairy building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping. When Briarcliff Manor was incorporated on November 21, 1902, Law owned all but two small parcels of the square-mile village and employed nearly all of its residents (around 100). He developed the village, establishing schools, churches, parks and the Briarcliff Lodge. The population grew, encouraging Law to incorporate the area as a village. A proposition was presented to the supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8, 1902 that a area with a population of 331 be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor, and it was incorporated on November 21. That year Law's son, Walter Jr., joined his father and brother Henry in managing the farm and realty company; he was the second village president, in office from 1905 to 1918. In April 1906, Governor General of Canada Albert Grey and US Representative and farm architect Edward Burnett drove up from New York City and toured the farm as guests of Walter Law. According to Briarcliff Outlook, they \\"expressed hearty approval of Briarcliff ways\\". =Relocation to Pine Plains= Barn A in Pine Plains around 1910 Law developed his Briarcliff Manor property primarily as a corporation until 1907 when, due to rising property values and falling agricultural development in Westchester County, he purchased twelve farms‚Äîtotaling ‚Äîfor Briarcliff Farms on both sides of the Pine Plains-Stanford Road (present-day New York State Route 82) in Pine Plains and began developing his Briarcliff Manor properties for houses, churches and schools. Law's general manager, George W. Tuttle (who had worked at Briarcliff Farms since 1901), arranged the Pine Plains purchases and the construction of new barns, a creamery, a power station and other buildings. The barns used Franklin Hiram King's King ventilation system, and the concrete dairy building cost about $25,000 ($ in ). The farm's well, from the barn, was deep and in diameter. In 1907 and 1908, the farm and many of its workers moved to Pine Plains. Although preliminary steps in the relocation were primarily small, the final October 1908 transfer used two trains to move 300 cattle. The rest of the cattle were transferred a day later, to the farm's main station (between Pine Plains and Attlebury on the Central New England Railway) at Barn A. During Briarcliff Manor's first automobile race in 1908, the barns were used for mechanic crews and each driver had his own crew weeks before the race. In 1909 Law formed the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Manor property. He sold the Pine Plains property in 1918 and died in 1924. Barn B in Pine Plains around 1910 On October 9, 1918, New York banker Oakleigh Thorne and several partners purchased the Briarcliff Farms property, cattle and dairy buildings for $500,000 ($ in ). Thorne began breeding Aberdeen Angus cattle under the Briarcliff Farms name, and the farm remained well known for its beef. Thorne and W. Alan McGregor began the herd by importing cattle from Scotland in 1925, and enlarged it through breeding. The Aberdeen Angus industry became prominent in the United States due to Briarcliff Farms; in 1955, about 95 percent of US Angus cattle were from Briarcliff stock. Thorne hired William Harper Pew for Pew's knowledge of livestock bloodlines. At the time, the farm had over and 1,000 purebred Aberdeen Angus cattle (the largest Aberdeen Angus herd in the country). Pew began eighteen Angus herds in Dutchess County, and was a director of the American Angus Association. At the International Livestock Show in 1927, the farm had the International Grand Champion Female, and in 1930 it had the 1930 International Grand Champion Bull. Because of the 1931 and 1933 expositions, Thorne became first to win a grand champion twice, with two of his livestock awarded International Grand Champion Steers. At the 1934 Dutchess County Fair's beef-cattle show, 100 cattle and steers were exhibited. Briarcliff Aristocrat, a summer yearling weighing , was named the grand champion steer. The grand champion bull was the farm's Briarcliff Barbarian 8th, the first- prize senior yearling of the 1933 International Livestock Show. The grand champion female was Briarcliff Mighonne 10th, the first-prize senior yearling heifer of the 1933 international show. The farm affected a number of herds, and the Briarcliff prefix is still seen in many pedigrees. In 1935 the portion of the farm east of the road was sold to Henry Jackson, who named it Bethel Farms. After Thorne's death in 1948, Briarcliff Farms changed hands a number of times. In 1968 it became Stockbriar Farm, a beef-feeding operation. Stockbriar tried to sell the farm several times, and it nearly became a county zoo. In 1979, Stockbriar sold the farmland to the Conservation and Preservation Association (CAPA) for $2.1 million ($ in ). In 1982 CAPA hired a Millbrook realtor, who advertised the farm for $2.75 million ($ in ) in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and newspapers published by Taconic Press. Around that time Stockbriar Farms filed four lawsuits against CAPA and its lessee (Mashomack Fish and Game Preserve) over the Pine Plains farm, claiming that the preserve operated a private club without a liquor permit and CAPA missed a March 23, 1982 payment which was the bulk of its total payment for the farm. Stockbriar Farms requested that Mashomack be evicted, and its property returned. One lawsuit was filed in county court, and the other three were filed in New York Supreme Court. Although Mashomack and CAPA won the first two, in 1984 a state supreme court justice ordered Mashomack and CAPA to vacate the property and Stockbriar Farms remained for sale. Locations =Briarcliff Manor= The farm, overlooking the Hudson River, was established between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers in the hamlet of Whitson's Corners (present-day Briarcliff Manor), from Manhattan. Its location was described in 1901 as \\"the most healthy, hilly portion of Westchester ...where there are neither swamps nor contaminated streams of water\\". The original land plot, long and wide, was developed within twelve years. In 1901, Briarcliff Farms (including its school farm) encompassed between Pleasantville and Old Briarcliff Roads north of Scarborough Road. At its peak, its original location covered . In Briarcliff Manor, the farm had six main barns: Barn A, near its office building on Pleasantville Road, housed the horses for the farm and the Briarcliff Lodge. The farm's blacksmith, wheelwright, harness shops and other buildings were located around that barn, and a smokehouse and butcher's shop were on-site. Barns B (housing 78 cattle) and C (housing 118 cattle) were at the south end of Dalmeny Road; Barn D (housing 116 cattle), between Beech Hill Road and New York State Route 117, was later used as a boarding stable for horses. Barn E (housing 118 cattle) was on Pleasantville Road just east of the present Taconic State Parkway, and Barn F (housing 118 cattle) was in Millwood near the intersection of the Taconic and New York State Route 100. The farm also had a large barn near New York State Route 9A for supplies, including feed for the farm. Each barn had an ice shed to cool milk; ice was harvested primarily from Echo Lake (source of the Pocantico River), with Kinderogen Lake (now part of the Edith Macy Conference Center) as a supplemental source. The farm had a large supply store, with feed and other items, southeast of the service station at North State and Pleasantville Roads. The Briarcliff Farms office, Walter Law's personal office, was also the first dairy building; it burned down in 1901, and was rebuilt the following year. From Briarcliff Manor's 1902 incorporation to the construction of its first municipal building in 1913, the office housed the village government. During the 1960s the building was redesigned, rebuilt and became a local union headquarters for the International Union of Operating Engineers. The farm was enclosed, and its pastures were divided by stone walls from within the farm; the stones were also used for roadbeds, and for walls of the farm buildings, office, and Law's house. Cottages on Dalmeny Road Walter Law encouraged his Briarcliff Farms employees to move into the village, selling or plots of land to workers for a nominal price. He asked workers to choose the type of house they wanted; he would have it built and hold the mortgage, or allow them to rent a cottage. Law built several wood-framed cottages near the farms, with steep front-gable roofs and open porches using some of the first-floor space. Of the cottages still standing, six are on Dalmeny Road and three are on Old Briarcliff Road. The farm also owned and operated a farm in Peekskill previously owned by John Paulding, a militiaman who helped capture British major John Andr√©, running the Peekskill farm as a nursery for maples, oaks, lindens, hemlocks, spruces and other trees. During the early 1900s Law purchased farms in Lewisboro and Pound Ridge, using those farms to replenish the main farm's cattle herd. He also purchased a house in Pound Ridge, which his Briarcliff Realty Company sold to Westchester County after his death; it became the headquarters of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, the county's largest park. Dalmeny Walter Law provided Dalmeny, a boarding house on Dalmeny Road, for the farm's single men. The building, modeled after the Mills Houses in New York City, was long and four stories tall. Its first floor had a social hall for meetings and entertainment, a parlor and reading room equipped with books, newspapers, magazines, and games, a large dining room, a private dining room, a kitchen and a bathroom with marble basins and clean towels. The upper floors had seventy individual bedrooms for the men, with bathrooms with showers and tubs on every floor. Dalmeny also had a resident barber. Farm workers were not required to live in the boarding house, although the number of people wanting to live there exceeded the space available. Rent was $15‚Äì18 per month, including room, board and laundry. Law frequently joined the men at meals, lecturers visited the boarding house and the farm workers had a performing orchestra, brass band and glee club. Dalmeny opened on Christmas 1899 and closed in July 1908, in conjunction with the farm's relocation to Upstate New York. Over a period of several months in 1909 the building was moved to the Briarcliff Lodge property, where it was adjacent to the Lodge's laundry building. When the Lodge was the campus of King's College from 1955 to 1994, the school called the former boarding house Harmony Hall and used it for classrooms and staff housing. In autumn 1979, King's College demolished the building shortly after dedicating a new classroom building. =Pine Plains= Briarcliff Farms' second location, in the town of Pine Plains, initially covered . The farm, from the hamlet of Pine Plains, was adjacent to the Central New England Railway in the shallow Stissing Basin and from the Hudson River. The Pine Plains farm had three barns, each built at a cost of about $20,000 ($ in ) and housing 200 Jersey cattle bedded in sawdust or shavings. Barn B was in the Pine Plains hamlet of Bethel and Barn C was farther south, in the town of Stanford. Operations Briarcliff Outlook cover, April 1906 The farm utilized the concept of a European country seat, through tenant farming, established blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, in addition to a butcher shop and smokehouse. Buildings were centrally located around Walter Law's manor house, many of which were constructed in the Tudor Revival style. The farm's office building, Dysart House, the Briarcliff Lodge, and the railroad station shared that architectural style. The farm, one of the first producers of certified milk in the US, operated under the supervision of the Milk Commission of the Medical Society of the County of New York. With the farm producing about of milk daily (an average of per cow per day), Briarcliff Farms was one of the largest dairy operations in the northeast. According to Nebraska's department of agriculture in 1903, the three largest owners of dairy cows in the eastern US were Fairfield Farm Dairy in New Jersey, Briarcliff Farms and the Walker-Gordon Laboratory Company (which had \\"branches in all of the principal cities\\"). In 1897 the farm had Jersey, Normande and Simmental cattle, selling the breeds' milk for 10, 12 and 15 cents per quart respectively. Briarcliff Farms also sold cream (with 50 percent butterfat) for 60 cents per quart, Jersey butter for 50 cents per pound and Normande or Simmental butter for 60 cents per pound. In 1909, half the farm's herd consisted of registered Jerseys and the other half high-grade Jerseys. In Pine Plains, many of Barn B's milkers were from the Netherlands because of that country's reputation for good milkers. In 1905, Briarcliff Farms was milking nearly 500 cows at any given time. The farm raised its own stock, feeding the cattle eight pounds of dry feed twice a day with pasture and green corn in summer. The feed mixture was 50 percent bran, 25 percent crushed oats and 25 percent cornmeal, all of which were claimed to be the best available. The farm required that each cow produce 6,000 pounds of milk with 5 percent butterfat or 5,000 pounds of milk with 6 percent butterfat, or she would be butchered or sold. Each cow ate an average of seven pounds of grain per day (varying from two pounds on pasture to 12 in winter), 1.5 to 2 pounds of oil meal each day and free-choice timothy and clover hay‚Äî daily, depending on size. Each worker milked, cleaned and groomed 16 to 18 cattle daily. The New York Milk Commission analyzed the farm's milk weekly; although the board of health regulations in New York allowed three million bacteria per cubic centimeter in milk, the milk commission limited bacteria to 30,000. The farm chilled its milk within two minutes of milking to , often limiting its bacteria counts to 200‚Äì400 per cc. A chemical analysis of the milk was performed every month; although regulations required a minimum of three percent butterfat, Briarcliff required its milk to have over five percent butterfat to be sold. A March 1905 New York Milk Commission analysis indicated that the farm's milk had 8.2 percent butterfat, the \\"richest Briarcliff product ever reported on\\". In 1901 the farm had 1,045 Jersey cattle, 4,000 chickens and ducks, 1,500 pigs, and 400 sheep. It grew, with 500 workers tending those animals in addition to Thoroughbred horses, pheasants and peacocks. The pigs (which included Chester Whites and Berkshires) lived outdoors, because the farm superintendent believed they should be penned only for breeding; in summer, they were allowed to run in the orchards or the woods. About 2,000 were butchered each year. The farm's 31 poultry houses had a head poulterer and 40 assistants; each building was , and they were spread around the property. The farm, which used 300-egg insulators, fed the hens a mix of grains (including oats, wheat and corn) five times a day. The farm butchered 7,000 broilers each season. Eggs sold for 35 to 50 cents per dozen, with demand exceeding supply. Broilers sold for $1.50 ($ in ) to $3.00 ($ in ) per pair. Briarcliff Farms raised about 300 lambs each spring, primarily Dorset Horns. The lambs, which were dressed (their internal organs removed) on the farm, sold for $12 ($ in ) or more apiece; demand also exceeded supply. The farm gardens grew a variety of crops, adapting to the market; in 1900 this included oats, rye, corn, wheat, buckwheat, carrots, mangolds, turnips, rutabagas, radishes, sugar beets, potatoes, apples, cabbages, rye, oat, and wheat straw, hay, corn stalks and silage. The farm rotated its grain production to grow better vegetables. At one time the farm had of asparagus, which sold for 35 to 50 cents per bunch. Briarcliff Farms operated a printing press and office north of the farm office on Pleasantville Road. The print shop produced Briarcliff Farms, the Briarcliff Bulletin in 1900, the monthly Briarcliff Outlook in 1903 and The Briarcliff Once-a-Week in 1908 (all edited by Arthur W. Emerson) and bottle caps for Briarcliff dairy products. The Briarcliff Table Water Company sold its products in New York City, Lakewood, New Jersey and the Westchester municipalities of Yonkers, Tarrytown, White Plains, and Ossining. The company owned wells. Around 1901, the Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1 (later the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department) housed its equipment and horses at Briarcliff Farms' Barn A. The American Plasmon Syndicate, a producer of the dried milk product plasmon, had its factory in Briarcliff for milk from Briarcliff Farms; the farm built the factory and its power plant. In a 1900 publication the farm's motto was reported to be \\"The production of pure food of the highest standard of excellence\\", although a 1902 publication reported that its motto was \\"Do unto a cow as you would that a cow would do unto you\\" (also saying that the motto appeared in large letters in every barn on the farm). Notices printed by the farm began with the verse, \\"If a Cobbler by trade, I'll make it my pride, the best of all Cobblers to be; and if only a Tinker, no Tinker on earth shall mend an old Kettle like me\\"; this verse and several other mottoes decorated friezes on the interior walls of the Dalmeny boarding house. =Processing and delivery= Bottling at Briarcliff Farms, 1906 At its peak, the farm delivered milk to areas from Albany to New York City. After it was cooled, the milk was brought daily to the dairy-processing building, where it was poured into a large, sterilized tank and forced‚Äîwith compressed air at per minute‚Äîthrough sterilized pipes to the building's second floor. There the milk was cooled, strained five times and bottled. The bottles were sealed with parchment circles with the supervising commission's certification and the date, and then put in boxes with ice. The entire process, from entering the building to bottling, took five minutes. Every utensil contacting the milk (or workers) would be regularly sterilized with live steam. The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it; its rooms had white-tiled walls and floors, with coving (concave tiling) between the walls and floors for better cleaning. Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating wire brushes and two hours of heat sterilization. Part of a Hotel McAlpin menu from 1917, with Briarcliff Farms milk offered by the bottle The farm's products were packaged as milk, cream, butter or kumyss, and sent every night on the New York and Putnam Railroad to New York City for delivery the next day; they were also sold in the farm's stores or from wagons. Briarcliff Farms had three stores in New York City and stores in Greenwich, Connecticut, Yonkers, Dobbs Ferry and Tarrytown. The farm's first New York City store was in Manhattan's Windsor Arcade, at Fifth Avenue and 46th Street, and it had an office in the Seymour Building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. The office produced advertisements for the New-York Tribune, The New York Times, New York Evening Post and the Mail and Express (papers which, according to Printers' Ink, advertised to wealthy residents). The farm's stores sold Briarcliff dairy products and table water. Milk was sent to the Hotel Lorraine, the St. Regis, the Waldorf Astoria, Mendel's Lunch Room at Grand Central Station and Milhau's Drug Store on Broadway, and kumyss was sent to seventeen New York City drugstores. Milk was sold to stores in New York free on board for $0.084 ($ in ) per quart. The farm also supplied the Briarcliff Lodge with cream, milk, butter, eggs and vegetables. It shipped its products in zinc-lined cases on ocean-going steamers and shipped nationwide every day except Sunday (shipping a double order on Saturday). The farm's milk was processed into milk, cheese, butter or buttermilk at its Barn A creamery in Pine Plains, and packaged for its rail shipment to New York City. =Ethos and advances= In 1906, Andrew Carnegie wrote about Briarcliff Farms: \\"Every known appliance or mode of treatment is at hand, and the herd is pronounced free from all and every ailment. In cases of doubt animals are sacrificed\\". The farm used the best obtainable stock, with extensive experimenting, for its products. The operation immediately removed every cow that appeared ill, and many cattle were butchered during the farm's first few years to improve the herd's overall health. According to Walter Law, \\"It is not the cows that have been put in, but those which have been taken out, that have made the Briarcliff herd what it is\\". The farm's large, light barns had concrete floors, which were cleaned daily, and up-to-date appliances for separating, churning, handling and packing its products. Law made annual five-dollar cash awards ($ in ) to workers in September (giving them out at Dalmeny on December 24), which included \\"most gentle with cows\\", \\"most careful teamster in feeding his horses and keeping his stables clean\\", \\"cleanest delivery wagon\\", \\"neatest house yard\\", \\"best garden truck\\" and \\"best-kept room in Dalmeny\\"; the farm emphasized the commercial value of such virtues. On Christmas Eve, after the Briarcliff Orchestra played George Frideric Handel's \\"Largo\\", Law spoke about the farm's improvements that year and awarded the prizes. The orchestra was made up of the farm's workers, and among its members was Law's son Walter Jr. Briarcliff Farms intended to prove that optimal farming practices could be profitable. Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse: \\"Cruelty to a cow is the same as cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm.\\" He knew everyone who lived at the farms, and the farm workers knew the name of each cow (which was on a brass plate at the front of the cow's stall). The cows were sponged several times a day, and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers. Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, rinsed and dried. Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a \\"perceptible effect upon their milk\\". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this. The farm had a veterinary chemist and a laboratory for regular milk analysis. Its dairy plant had a visitor-observation area, permitting the viewing of each step of the farm's dairy processing. In one room (separated from the viewing area by glass doors), cream was skimmed; in a second milk was bottled, and in a third butter was churned. The building's sterilizing, pasteurizing, and shipping departments were in the basement. Briarcliff Farms shipped of milk, of cream and of butter each day. Students from the Ethical Culture School and nurses from New York City hospitals visited the farm to learn about its practices in relation to their work, and Briarcliff Farms was reportedly chosen as the most typical New York industry available for inspection. =Greenhouses= The Briarcliff Rose on a village sign Although Briarcliff Farms' primary operation was dairy, a secondary agricultural product was its American Beauty rose. The farm had two groups of greenhouses; one, behind Walter Law's house and west of the Briarcliff Lodge, produced decorations for Briarcliff Farms, the Briarcliff Lodge and Law's and his workers' houses. The other group, the Pierson commercial greenhouses, grew the American Beauty rose and rare carnations; it produced 22 varieties and about 2,500 blooms a day. The greenhouses, advanced for their time, had light steel frames and glass panes unique in their \\"almost unshadowed exposure to the light\\". The newer greenhouses, , held up to 40,000 plants apiece. The Pierson roses, which earned up to $100,000 ($ in ) a year, were sold in winter for eight to 12 cents each with most shipped to New York City. The Briarcliff Lodge sponsored an annual American Beauty carnival with a golf tournament, water sports, moonlight bathing and night diving, a dinner dance, a cinema program and a concert. Greenhouse foreman George Romaine propagated an American Beauty rose with longer, more-pointed buds and a brighter color, and Paul M. Pierson registered it with the American Rose Society as the Briarcliff Rose. It is Briarcliff Manor's village symbol, and since 2006 has been used on village street signs. Although the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club also uses the Briarcliff Rose as its symbol, the variety is now lost. School of Practical Agriculture The school's first building During the winter of 1895-96, the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor researched the causes of youth moving from the country to cities to develop the most efficient method of attracting them back to the country. That, and an examination of agricultural needs for a year, resulted in meetings at the homes of Abram S. Hewitt and R. Fulton Cutting and the formation of the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture. The committee, chaired by Hewitt, included Cutting, Jacob H. Schiff, John G. Carlisle, Mrs. Seth Low, Josephine Shaw Lowell, Walter Law and William E. Dodge. Its board of trustees had five officers (with Theodore L. Van Norden president) and seventeen other trustees, including Law, V. Everit Macy and James Speyer. George T. Powell, a \\"recognized authority on scientific agriculture\\" according to The New York Times, was consulted; he later organized the school and became its director. When Walter Law was included the school took shape, since he provided its land and building. In September 1900, Law and the committee established the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture as part of Briarcliff Farms, on an elevated site about midway between the Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville train stations on Pleasantville Road. Law leased the 66 acres (which were worth $1,000 ($ in ) an acre) for 20 years at the rate of a dollar per year, gave the trustees $30,000 ($ in ) to build a dormitory and promised them $3,000 ($ in ) a year for expenses until the school earned a profit. With that and $30,000 from the trustees, the school opened; the committee focused the curriculum on horticulture, floriculture, gardening and aviculture. The school's progress was followed by members of the public interested in agricultural education. The school's landscape gardens When it was founded, the school was considered an experiment. Its goal was \\"to open an independent means of livelihood for young men and women, especially of our cities; to demonstrate that higher values may be obtained from land under intelligent management, and to develop a taste for rural life.\\" Most students were trained in garden and farm operations in a two-year course, with short summer courses in nature study also offered. The academic year had three terms, with twelve weeks of vacation. Although the school allowed new students to begin at any term, a September start was considered the most desirable. Instruction was offered in agriculture, horticulture, cold storage, botany, chemistry, geology, physics, agricultural zoology, entomology, beekeeping, meteorology, land surveying and leveling, soils, drainage, irrigation, tillage, fertilizers, plant diseases, stock, fruit growing, landscape gardening and bookkeeping. It was a practical school, with no attempt to provide a general education. Work included caring for orchard trees and bush fruit, greenhouse culture of fruits and vegetables, jelly- and jam-making, market gardening, tillage, fertilizer use, hybridizing and propagating flowers, harvesting and marketing crops. The school used Briarcliff Farms, where students worked the land, tested milk and cared for a variety of animals. Students also raised flowers, vegetables and fruit, and accompanied their products to cities for marketing. The New York Botanical Garden arranged with the school for student access to its lectures, museums and conservatories. Tuition was $100 a year ($ in ), and board $280 a year ($ in ). Instruction was primarily weekday-morning lectures with laboratory work; during the afternoon, students worked on the school farm (which had a foreman, gardener and several workmen to ensure continuous operation) under instructor supervision. In 1901 35 students attended, followed by 34 in 1902 (almost all from cities), ranging in age from 16 to 35. Most had a high-school education before enrolling, and some had been to college. The school had a capacity of 35 students, and planned to expand. For one year it met in the basement of Pleasantville's public school (until the Briarcliff Farms building was completed), and did not provide housing. The farm building was completed in spring 1901 and dedicated on May 15. The large Colonial Revival building, with a plain exterior and wide halls, had lecture halls, a library, a laboratory, an office, a dining hall and dormitory space for 40 staff members and students. Its grounds had an orchard, a working garden, experimental greenhouses, poultry houses, a farmhouse and barns. The school's faculty included a director, a horticulturalist, an agriculturalist and instructors in nature study and cold storage. It was coeducational, with identical courses for men and women. Students were required to be proficient in English, provide good references, be at least 16 years of age, and be in good health. On January 1, 1902 Henry Francis du Pont, then in his third year at Harvard University, wrote to Powell requesting admission to the school; Powell replied that DuPont was listed first in the school's 1903 class. However, DuPont was unable to attend and left Harvard (perhaps due to his mother's sudden death in autumn 1902). =Relocation and closure= The school outgrew its Briarcliff location, and in autumn 1902 R. Fulton Cutting purchased a farm near Poughkeepsie as a permanent upstate location. Prior to the move, the school was popularly known as the Briarcliff School, and after moving it became formally known as the School of Practical Agriculture at Poughkeepsie. When the school was established there, Theodore Van Norden said that it needed funds for equipment and an endowment. The land had no buildings, and thus the school rented two houses in Poughkeepsie until funds were obtained to build. It initially hoped to raise one million dollars; in 1903, after raising $50,000 ($ in ) of a hoped-for $150,000 ($ in ) to operate the school, director George Powell announced that it would close and the property would be sold. Cutting presented a plan to the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts to carry out the plan devised for the school in Poughkeepsie. In 1908, school funds were donated to Cornell University as the Agricultural Student Loan Fund for students in Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. From 1903 to 1905 the original school building was known as Pocantico Lodge, a small year-round hotel. In 1905 Alice Knox, an employee at Mrs. Dow's School, opened Miss Knox's School in the building. Destroyed by fire in 1912, the school moved to nearby Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. The Knox School moved to St. James, on Long Island, in 1954. The only remaining feature of the Pocantico Lodge building is a stone retaining wall in front of the current building on the site, built in 1925 by Oscar Vatet for Rufus P. Johnston (pastor of John D. Rockefeller's Fifth Avenue Baptist Church). The building, later occupied by Arthur O'Connor, Cognitronics, and Frank B. Hall, is currently an unused part of Briarcliff Corporate Campus. Farm status The original farmhouse, now the rectory of St. Theresa's Catholic Church Most of the Pine Plains farmland is occupied by Berkshire Stud, a Thoroughbred breeding farm which purchased beginning in 1983, and the Mashomack Polo Club (which owns the farmhouse on Halcyon Lake). The farm's creamery and several barns (some built during the 19th century) still stand at the polo club, and have been used since the 1980s for stables, farm-equipment storage and the raising of sporting birds. The barns also housed the Triangle Arts Association (part of the Triangle Arts Trust) from 1982 to 1993. In Briarcliff Manor, part of the original Stillman farmhouse survives as the rectory of St. Theresa's Catholic Church and several employee wood-framed cottages still stand on Dalmeny and Old Briarcliff Roads. Similar houses are on South State, Pleasantville, and Poplar Roads. The farm's dairy building is owned by Consolidated Edison; the company also owns a nearby building which formerly housed the Briarcliff Manor Light and Power Company. The Plasmon Company of America's Woodside Avenue factory is now an automotive restoration facility.

It was claimed that in her letter she extolled her own skills which she deemed not to be inferior to those of the members of the Guild whom she called 'dozijnwerkers' (workers by the dozen). Eight sculptor-members of the Guild reacted to her letter and her statements, which they deemed damaging to their reputation, by letter of 12 January 1633.

HMS Acheron The Admiralty named their purchase HMS Acheron and had her fitted out as a bomb vessel between 28 October and 2 March 1804, at Woolwich Dockyard. Commander Arthur Farquhar commissioned her in December 1803 for the Mediterranean. In July Acheron was part of the British squadron blockading the port, bottling up the French fleet. Between 2 and 5 August, bad weather drove the British off station. Admiral de Latouche Tr√©ville took the opportunity to sortie from Toulon to give his crews an opportunity to train. However, he did not try to sail to Boulogne, as Napoleon desired.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.239‚Äì40. In fairness, de Latouche Tr√©ville was ill and died on 10 August. On 23 November Achiron [sic] captured the Adamo. Acheron also shared in the proceeds of the capture by Nelson's fleet of Maria Magdalena, St. Judas Tadeo, Victoria, Agatha, and Corvo on 15, 17, and 21 November, and 8 December. Captain Richard Budd Vincent, of Arrow, arrived in Malta on 20 December from Naples. At Malta, he received instructions to take the merchant vessels gathered there to England, once some merchantmen arrived from Smyrna to join the convoy. The orders further specified that he was to take Acheron with him to assist him in protecting the trade. Arrow was returning to England as she was badly in need of repairs that could only be performed there. The vessels from Smyrna arrived on 2 January 1805, and the convoy left for England on 4 January.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 17, pp.278‚Äì306. The vessels from Smyrna arrived on 2 January 1805, and the convoy left for England on 4 January. The brig had escorted the convoy from Smyrna and she continued on as an escort as far as western Sicily. The convoy numbered some 25‚Äì30 vessels.Lloyd's List, no.4197, ‚Äì accessed 16 October 2014. A later account gives the vessels as the transport Dutchess of Rutland and 29 British merchant vessels. Between 19 and 22 January, bad weather off the coast of Spain caused the convoy to separate into two parts, one with Arrow and the other with Acheron. During the night of 29 January the brig Union apparently foundered with all hands during a squall. On 2 February, the convoy fell in with the Spanish ship Gravina, which had captured on 27 January. Gravina was on her way to Malta but Captain Hyde Parker of Amazon had instructed the commander of the prize crew to sail to England should he encounter a convoy sailing there. Gravina therefore joined the convoy. Fate The and the were cruising off the coast of Algeria when on 1 February 1805, they engaged a convoy, destroying seven ships. Two days later, they encountered another convoy. End of the action between HMS Arrow and Acheron and the French frigates Hortense and Incorruptible, Francis Sartorious, Jr., National Maritime Museum, Greenwich This second convoy was the convoy that Arrow and Acheron were escorting. Early on the morning of 3 February the British were off Cape Caxine when they sighted the two French vessels, which the British initially thought they might be members of the convoy rejoining. When it became clear that the strange vessels were French frigates, Arrow threw off the tow to the brig Adventure, which had been leaking and which the British destroyed to prevent her falling into enemy hands. Arrow and Acheron then placed themselves between the convoy and the pursuing French. Vincent signaled the vessels of the convoy to make for a per- designated rendezvous point. The French frigates did not catch up to the Royal Navy vessels until the morning of 4 February. Initially, Hortense engaged Acheron, and Arrow fired a broadside into Hortense as well. About two hours later, Incorruptible joined the action. Vincent signaled to Duchess of Rutland, the most capable, though minimally so, of the merchant vessels, to join the action, a signal Duchess of Rutland ignored. Throughout the action the Royal Navy vessels were at a disadvantage. Not only did the French frigates have more cannons and men, but the French cannons were guns, whereas the British cannons were almost all carronades. The French could therefore stand off and fire their guns while out of the effective range of the carronades. Also, the French were carrying a large number of troops who harassed the British with small arms fire whenever the vessels closed.Marshall (1825), Supplement 2, Part 2, pp.912‚Äì929. After about an hour Vincent had to strike. Arrows hold was filling with water and four of her cannons were dismounted. She also had heavy casualties. All of Arrows boats had been destroyed, but boats from Incorruptible took off the survivors, and rescue those men from Arrow that jumped into the water as Arrow turned on her beam ends and sank. In the battle, of the 132 men on board, Arrow lost 13 men killed and 27 wounded, at least two of whom died later. The number included passengers, some 17 of whom were being invalided home. A lady, her infant, and her ladies' maid were also taking passage on board. Acheron fought on for another quarter of an hour before she too struck. She had lost three or four men killed and eight wounded. She had a complement of 67 men, and at least two passengers, a lieutenant of marines and his servant, both of whom were killed. She was so damaged that the French burnt her. Hortense had 10 men killed out of her crew of 300 men and the 350 artillerymen she was carrying.L' Abeille du nord, Vol. 10, p.22. The French frigates also captured three ships of the convoy; the rest of the convoy escaped.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.391‚Äì397. One of the vessels the French captured was Dutchess of Rutland, whose master failed to destroy her convoy signals and instructions; fortunately the French had to return to port to effect repairs and did not take advantage of the opportunity this represented. The French scuttled the three merchant vessels they had captured. After the loss of their escorts, some of the surviving vessels of the convoy fell prey to privateers. Fuerte, of Cadiz, captured Alert, Langley, master, Castle, Anderson, master, a ship, and a brig, and sent them into Malaga. Reportedly, Fuerte had captured a fifth vessel that she sent into Algeciras. One of the vessels Fuerte sent into Malaga was later identified as , which was one of several ships of the convoy that had turned to sail back to Malta.Lloyd's List, no.4205,. It later turned out that British frigate Fisgard and the sloop had been at Cape Pallas (), a few leagues from the action.Nicholas & Nelson (1846), Vol. 6, pp.213. However, they were unaware of it and so did not come to the convoy's assistance. Hortense took Farquhar and his men into Malaga, from where they were exchanged relatively quickly. The court martial of Farquhar, his officers, and men, for the loss of their vessel took place on in Palma Bay, Sardinia.This appears to be Porto Palma, Caprera, in the Maddalena archipelago. Nelson and his fleet were anchored there. (Some accounts mistake Palma Bay for Palma, Mallorca.) Farquhar, his officers, and men, were honourably acquitted. Farquahar then received a promotion to post captain for his bravery. The French held Vincent and his crew as prisoners in Cartagena, Spain, for almost three months from 8 February until early May. Vincent had managed to keep his Turkish sabre when he left Arrow, but a French officer confiscated it and the French refused to return it. Eventually, Admiral Lord Nelson was able to arrange a cartel brig to return the British prisoners to Gibraltar. From there they left for England on 28 May on the storeship Camel, arriving at Saint Helen's on 4 June. The court martial of Vincent and his crew for the loss of Arrow convened on 17 June aboard at Portsmouth. The court martial honourably acquitted all; Vincent received promotion to post captain immediately thereafter. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded both Vincent and Farquahar honour swords, each worth ¬£100. In addition, the Fund awarded Vincent a piece of plate of the same value. Furthermore, the Fund paid out ¬£545 to the wounded and the families of those who had died. At the request of Lloyd's, the Chairman of the association of Merchants Trading to South of Europe provided Vincent with the sum of ¬£477 10s, and a proportionate amount to Farquhar, for them to procure clothing and necessities for their officers and crew, who had lost everything when they were captured and their vessels were destroyed. Vincent received ¬£50, and each seaman received ¬£2 10s. On 19 September 1808, the merchants of Malta awarded Farquhar with a piece of plate and a complementary letter.Dictionary of National Biography (1889), Vol. 18, p.221. The merchants also presented Vincent with a piece of plate.Dictionary of National Biography (1909), Vol. 20, p. 362. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Arrow 3 Feby. 1805\\" to the eight surviving claimants from Arrow, and the clasp \\"Acheron 3 Feby. 1805\\" to the one surviving claimant from Acheron.

She is known as a leading figure of Turkish Cypriot poetry and a vocal advocate of women's rights.Turan, Metin. √áaƒüda≈ü Kƒ±brƒ±s T√ºrk ≈ûiirinde Eƒüilimler/ Y√∂nelimler (√áukurova University) Retrieved on 26 January 2015.  Biography  Neriman Cahit was born in Krini (known as Kƒ±rnƒ± in Turkish at the time) in 1937. The eldest of three sisters, she went to her village's primary school for three years. Her parents, concerned for the education of their daughter, transferred her to the Atat√ºrk Primary School in Nicosia, where she resided for the rest of her life. She started penning her thoughts at the 5th year of primary school. She went to the Victoria Girls' High School, where she studied classics with the help of her philosophy teacher and became increasingly vocal with her writing. She then went on to study at the Teachers' College, and was forced to transfer to the newly formed Teachers' College of Turkish Cypriots in 1957 due to the nascent intercommunal strife. Her early poetry in this period was more focused on natural and romantic themes; it shifted towards social issues with time. She started writing with a free style, not incorporating rhyme schemes into her poetry. After her graduation, she was sent to the village of Klavdia for her first duty. She continued teaching for 33 years and often in remote villages, claiming that it was \\"as if she was exiled because of her opposition\\". During her career, she was a vocal figure in the Turkish Cypriot Teachers' Union (KT√ñS) and defended women's rights, free press and labor unions. She published her first works in the 1960s under a male pseudonym due to restrictions imposed on her by her family. Some trials were filed against this pseudonym at the time. Observing the state of Turkish Cypriot women in the villages that she worked in, she reflected the conditions they suffered from. Throughout her career as a teacher, her articles, poems, researches and interviews were published in Turkish Cypriot newspapers. She is considered one of the leading advocates of women's rights. Her first book, K.T.√ñ.S. M√ºcadele Tarihi (\\"History of KT√ñS Struggle\\") was published in 1987, followed by her first poetry book, Sƒ±kƒ±ntƒ±ya Vurulan D√ºƒü√ºm in 1988. Her first book entirely focused on women, Konu: Kadƒ±n (\\"Subject: Woman\\") was published in 1989. Since then, she has released a number of books consisting of her poetry, interviews, research and articles. Some of the topics explored in her work are womanhood in Cyprus, the city of Nicosia and the perception of sexuality in the Turkish Cypriot society. She has expressed her passion for Nicosia, the deep entrenchment of the city in her soul and the pain that the city's division gives to her. She has been the recipient of at least 15 awards in literature, including awards from the Turkish magazine Nokta, from Humanist International and from the International Organization of Turkic Culture. She is the founder of the Women's Research Center and currently writes periodicals in the Turkish Cypriot daily newspaper Yeni D√ºzen.

The society believes that the written and spoken word are of equal importance, and therefore the society promotes both the debating and literary sides of the society equally. The society aims to promote freedom of expression, specifically by holding weekly literary and debating events. Its objectives are to initiate, spark, and facilitate debate within the student body. It operates under the Maynooth Students' Union as one of Maynooth University's Clubs & Societies.  Literary  = Literary circles = The society hosts Literary Circles on a weekly basis. These meetings are forums in which both writers and readers can share their own writing, as well as pieces of writing that they wish to share with the group. Group discussion is encouraged and constructive criticism is offered between members. = Poetry slam = The society hosts a poetry slam each semester. Competitors perform up to two poems of up to three minutes in length. It is judged by a panel of three judges, including the society's Literary Convener if they are not a competitor themselves. Notable past judges include Maynooth University's lecturers Dr. Conrad Brunstrom, Dr. Moynagh Sullivan, plus the slam poets Ois√≠n McKenna and Lewis Kenny.  Debating  = House Debates = Maynooth Literary & Debating Society hosts house debates on a regular basis in the college. The purpose of these debates is to facilitate discussion among members about current issues and affairs, as well as motions about morality. Notable debates in recent years include This House Supports Same-Sex Marriage, This House Supports the Death Penalty, and This House Would Legalise Prostitution. = Maynooth Open = The Maynooth Open is a debating inter-varsity competition open to all university debating societies. The competition was founded in 2010. It uses the British Parliamentary Debate format, the style used in the World Universities Debating Championships. It consists of 4 rounds of 7-minute speeches, with the top 8 teams breaking to open motion semi-finals, and the final 4 competing in the open final & black tie gala. = Maidens Competition = The society hosts an annual debating competition for novice speakers. The competition is open to all society members who have not competitively debated at university level before. The competition is run by the society's internal competitions convener. There are two preliminary rounds, followed by the semi- finals and the final. = Aoife Begley Memorial Schools Competition = The Aoife Begley competition is an annual secondary schools debating competition hosted and run by the Literary & Debating Society in Maynooth. The competition is aimed at Senior Cycle Students. The majority of entries to date come from schools in the Greater Dublin and Kildare area, although it is not unknown to see schools from further away, such as Laois or Wexford. The competition is named after Ms. Aoife Begley, a past auditor of the society. Aoife Begley died while convenor of the then Secondary Schools Competition, and so the society renamed the competition in her memory.  Guest Speakers  The society hosts events with guest speakers on a variety of topics. Notable guest speakers to date include the Irish broadcaster George Hook, who spoke at a debate on the topic of renewable energy. In 2014 the society welcomed the author Louise O'Neill who spoke about her debut novel 'Only Ever Yours', feminism, and writing.

Common causes of PCL injuries are direct blows to the flexed knee, such as the knee hitting the dashboard in a car accident or falling hard on the knee, both instances displacing the tibia posterior to the femur. Surgery to repair the posterior cruciate ligament is controversial due to its placement and technical difficulty. The posterior drawer test is one of the tests used by doctors and physiotherapists to detect injury to the PCL. An additional test of posterior cruciate ligament injury is the posterior sag test, where, in contrast to the drawer test, no active force is applied. Rather, the person lies supine with the leg held by another person so that the hip is flexed to 90 degrees and the knee 90 degrees.Posterior Sag Test From The University of West Alabama, Athletic Training & Sports Medicine Center. Retrieved Feb 2011 The main parameter in this test is step-off, which is the shortest distance from the femur to a hypothetical line that tangents the surface of the tibia from the tibial tuberosity and upwards. Normally, the step-off is approximately 1 cm, but is decreased (Grade I) or even absent (Grade II) or inverse (Grade III) in injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament. Patients who are suspected to have a posterior cruciate ligament injury should always be evaluated for other knee injuries that often occur in combination with an PCL injuries. These include cartilage/meniscus injuries, bone bruises, ACL tears, fractures, posterolateral injuries and collateral ligament injuries. Cause In this medial view of the flexed knee, the lateral femoral condyle has been removed to reveal the structure of the PCL. Because the anterolateral bundle is stretched and the posteromedial bundle relaxed during flexion, excessive flexion in the form of hyperflexion causes tensile stress, shown in red, on the anterolateral bundle of the PCL that leads to PCL injury. =Related anatomy= To understand how posterior cruciate ligament injury can occur, one must consider the anatomical and physiological properties of the PCL. The PCL is located within the knee joint where it stabilizes the articulating bones, particularly the femur and the tibia, during movement. It originates from the lateral edge of the medial femoral condyle and the roof of the intercondyle notch then stretches, at a posterior and lateral angle, toward the posterior of the tibia just below its articular surface. In this medial view of the extended knee, the lateral femoral condyle has been removed to reveal the structure of the PCL. Because the posteromedial bundle is stretched and the anterolateral bundle relaxed during extension, excessive extension in the form of hyperextension causes tensile stress, shown in red, on the posteromedial bundle of the PCL that leads to PCL injury. =Related physiological features= Although each PCL is a unified unit, they are described as separate anterolateral and posteromedial sections based on each section's attachment site and function. During knee joint movement, the PCL rotates such that the anterolateral section stretches in knee flexion but not in knee extension and the posteromedial bundle stretches in extension rather than flexion. =The types of mechanisms that lead to PCL injury= In this position, the PCL functions to prevent movement of the tibia in the posterior direction and to prevent the tilting or shifting of the patella. However, the respective laxity of the two sections makes the PCL susceptible to injury during hyperflexion, hyperextension, and in a mechanism known as a dashboard injury. Because ligaments are viscoelastic (p. 50 ) they can handle higher amounts of stress only when the load is increased slowly (p. 30 ). When hyperflexion and hyperextension occur suddenly in combination with this viscoelastic behavior, the PCL deforms or tears. In the third and most common mechanism, the dashboard injury mechanism, the knee experiences impact in a posterior direction during knee flexion toward the space above the tibia. These mechanisms occur in excessive external tibial rotation and during falls that induce a combination of extension and adduction of the tibia, which is referred to as varus-extension stress, or that occur while the knee is flexed. Diagnosis Prevention =Knee injury= Knee injuries are very common among athletes as well as regular active people and can always be prevented. Ligament tears account for more than forty percent of knee injuries and the posterior cruciate ligament is considered one of the less common injuries. Although it is less common, there are still important measures that can be taken in order to prevent this type of knee injury. Maintaining proper exercise and sport technique is crucial for injury prevention, which include not exceeding the body or not going over the proper range of motion of the knee, properly warming up and cooling down =Quadriceps and hamstring ratio= Another important aspect of maintaining an injury free knee is having strong quadriceps and hamstring muscles because they help stabilize the knee. A low hamstring to quadriceps ratio is associated with knee injury and should be about eighty percent. Some exercises to strengthen the quadriceps and hamstring muscles include leg curls, leg lifts, prone knee flexion with resistance band and knee extensions. Some stretches to help prevent injury to the posterior cruciate ligament include stretching of the hamstring muscles by extending the legs, toes pointing up, leaning forward until the stretch is felt and holding for a few seconds. Exercises that strengthen the knee joints and the hamstrings include prone knee flexion. Where the knee flexes all the way back to the rear end, hold for about 10 seconds, then slowly lower to original position and repeat. =Exercises and stretches= In addition, balancing exercises have also been adopted because it has been proven that people with poor balance have more knee injuries than those with good balance. Wobble boards and Bosu balls are very common pieces of equipment used to balance and help prevent knee injuries as long as they are being used with trained personnel. Another possible preventive measure is wearing knee straps to help stabilize the knee and protect it from injury, especially during demanding sports such as football. Treatment It is possible for the PCL to heal on its own. Surgery is usually required in complete tears of the ligament. Surgery usually takes place after a few weeks, in order to allow swelling to decrease and regular motion to return to the knee. A procedure called ligament reconstruction is used to replace the torn PCL with a new ligament, which is usually a graft taken from the hamstring or Achilles tendon from a host cadaver. An arthroscope allows a complete evaluation of the entire knee joint, including the knee cap (patella), the cartilage surfaces, the meniscus, the ligaments (ACL & PCL), and the joint lining. Then, the new ligament is attached to the bone of the thigh and lower leg with screws to hold it in place.http://www.orthspec.com/pdfs/PCL-injuries.pdf PCL repair can also be undertaken. This differs from PCL reconstruction because a graft is not needed and the native PCL is reattached. Rehabilitation =Grades of injury= The posterior cruciate ligament is located within the knee. Ligaments are sturdy bands of tissues that connect bones. Similar to the anterior cruciate ligament, the PCL connects the femur to the tibia. There are four different grades of classification in which medical doctor's classify a PCL injury: Grade I, the PCL has a slight tear. Grade II, the PCL ligament is minimally torn and becomes loose. Grade III, the PCL is torn completely and the knee can now be categorized as unstable. Grade IV, the ligament is damaged along with another ligament housed in the knee e.g. ACL or posteromedial corner. With these grades of PCL injuries, there are different treatments available for such injuries. =Rehabilitation options= It is possible for the PCL to heal on its own without surgery when it is in Grades I and II. PCL injuries that are diagnosed in these categories can have their recovery times reduced by performing certain rehabilitative exercises. Fernandez and Pugh(2012) found that following a PCL grade II diagnosis, a multimodal treatment that spanned over the course of 8 weeks consisting of chiropractic lumbopelvic manipulation, physiotherapy, and implementing an exercise program that emphasized in eccentric muscle contraction (lunges, 1-leg squats, and trunk stabilization) which proved to be an effective way to recover from the PCL injury. For Grades III and IV, operative surgery is recommended or is usually needed. Grafts is the method when addressing PCL injuries that are in need of operative surgery. With grafts, there are different methods such as the tibial inlay or tunnel method. This picture shows the rehabilitative exercise called a ‚Äúlunge‚Äù used to treat and strengthen PCL injuries. Epidemiology =Percentage of PCL to other knee injuries= According toMajewski et al. the posterior cruciate ligament injuries only account for 1.5 percent of all knee injuries (figure 2). If it is a single injury to the posterior cruciate ligament that requires surgery only accounted for 1.1 percent compared to all other cruciate surgeries but when there was multiple injuries to the knee the posterior cruciate ligament accounted for 1.2 percent of injuries. =National statistics= In 2010 national statistics was done by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for posterior cruciate ligaments injuries. They found that 463 patients were discharge for having some type of PCL injury. The 18- to 44-year-old age group was found to have the highest injuries reported (figure 1). One reason why this age group consists of the majority of injuries to the PCL is because people are still very active in sports at this age. Men were also reported having more injuries to the PCL (figure 3). =Recommendation for surgery= A grade III PCL injury with more than 10mm posterior translation when the posterior drawer examination is performed may be treated surgically. Patients that do not improve stability during physical therapy or develop an increase in pain will be recommended for surgery.(Mariani teal., 2002) References External links * () * Dealing with Torn Ligament in the Knee * http://www.orthspec.com/pdfs/PCL-injuries.pdf Category:Ligaments of the lower limb Category:Knee injuries ","title":"Posterior cruciate ligament injury"},{"id":"45211431","text":"Suzanne Farrington (n√©e Holman; 12 October 1933 ‚Äì 1 March 2015) was a British actress. She was the only child of Vivien Leigh and her first husband, Herbert Leigh Holman. Upon her mother's death, Farrington was bequeathed her mother's papers, including her letters, photographs, contracts and diaries. Early years On 12 October 1933, Suzanne Holman was born at a nursing home at 8 Bulstrode Street, London. Her mother was 19 years old, and had been married to the barrister Herbert Leigh Holman for less than a year. Her diary entry on this day simply read: \\"Had a baby- a girl.\\" The birth was difficult. Suzanne was born a month prematurely and the delivery was not an easy one. It was several weeks before mother and daughter came home, but once there it did not take Vivien long to become bored, as the household was being run quite adequately by the staff, and the baby was well tended by the nurse nanny. The Holman household consisted of a maid, cook and Nanny Oake who had been hired to care for the new baby.Edwards 1978, p. 24. Although Vivien concentrated on her acting career, soon receiving good notices in the play, The Mask of Virtue, she did occasionally appear in the role of the new mother, being photographed holding her baby.Taylor 1984, p. 38. With the professional name of Vivien Leigh, her mother became more involved and more successful with her acting career, while her husband and raising her daughter became less important.Dent 1969, p. 144. Although Leigh initially had great concern for her daughter's well-being, her career was paramount and Suzanne's care became the responsibility of her father and maternal grandmother, Gertrude Hartley. During the Second World War, Suzanne travelled to Canada with her grandmother, to stay with her aunt, Florence Thompson.Capua 2003, p. 58. She continued her education during the war years, first at a convent school in Vancouver.Edwards 1978, p. 126. Only once in November 1940, did Leigh visit her daughter in Canada.Vickers 1988, p. 133. The visit turned out to be traumatic for all involved as the media soon discovered that \\"Scarlett\\" was in Vancouver, and that her daughter was enrolled in a convent school, spurring not only unwanted publicity for Suzanne but spurious claims that she would be the subject of a kidnapping. The Reverend Mother also feared for the safety of other children in her care, resulting in Suzanne being transferred by her grandmother to a day school. Gertrude Hartley altered her plans and remained with her granddaughter throughout the war years.Walker 1987, p. 154. In 1940 Leigh and Holman divorced, with her father gaining custody over Suzanne. After her marriage to Laurence Olivier, Leigh had little contact with her daughter until 1950, although Suzanne became close with Simon Tarquin Olivier, her stepfather's son from his marriage to Jill Esmond.Capus 2003, p. 114. Her \\"coming out\\" party was held at the Oliviers' flat in Lowndes Square, London.Coleman 2005, p. 309. Later years After completing her education at Sherborne School for Girls and a Swiss finishing school, beginning in 1951, Suzanne studied for two years at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although hoping to become an actress, after her appearance at the faculty's annual performance in March 1953, she did not continue in that career.Holman, Suzanne. \\"Vivien Leigh faces her biggest fight\\", vivandlarry.com (originally published in the Sunday Chronicle, 22 March 1953); retrieved 25 January 2015.

Stony Man Mountain, also known as Stony Man, is a mountain in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia and is the most northerly 4,000 foot peak in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Its maximum elevation is 4,011 feet or 1,223 meters above sea level with a clean prominence of 651 feet. The mountain is co-located in Madison and Page counties and is easily accessed from Skyline Drive by hiking trails. Along with Hawksbill Mountain (4,051 feet), it is only one of two peaks in the park higher than 4,000 feet. The shortest route to the summit is from the Skyland Resort and gains less than 400 vertical feet in about 1 kilometer. A longer, more challenging, route is from the Skyline Drive trail head at about milepost 39 of the Skyline Drive and gains almost 800 feet. The peak sits just southeast of the Appalachian Trail (AT) but the summit is accessible from the AT by previously mentioned spur trails. On the upper slopes of Stony Man one can see a few red spruce and balsam fir trees which typically grow in more northerly latitudes. The mountain is composed of ancient basalt which was metamorphosed into Greenstone through heat and pressure.

Missionary career Edwin Sebastian Butz was born in 1864 in the United States. In 1895 he came to the South Pacific with his wife Florence and daughter Alma on the third voyage of the SDA schooner Pitcairn. They served first on Pitcairn Island, then in the early days of the Adventist mission in Tonga. They arrived in Tonga on 29 September 1896 with Sarah and Maria Young, two nursing trainees from Pitcairn Island. There they joined the first SDA missionaries, Edward Hilliard and his wife Ida, who had arrived the previous year. The Butz's initially had difficulty being accepted, as they were Americans and most Europeans in Tonga were British. This was eased by Florence Butz's provision of medical services. The Butz's tried to establish a permanent mission, but were mainly limited to working with the small papalagi (European) colony. They made sporadic missionary efforts in the islands of Ha ªapai and Tongatapu. In June 1899 the Pitcairn again visited, bringing a small prefabricated building that was used at first as a mission home and as a chapel. After 18 months it was taken apart and rebuilt as the small Nuku ªalofa church, . The Butz's were taken to Vava ªu on the Pitcairn, since it was thought that there were too many missionaries at Nuku'alofa, but they returned after the Hilliards left later in 1899. In 1901 Butz attended the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists in Battle Creek College, where he was ordained to the ministry. In Tonga Butz recognized but failed to address the language problem. He noted that the Tongans were very interested in learning English. Until 1905 at least half of the pupils at the Adventist schools were European, or partly European, and the lessons were given in English. The Butz family left Tonga on 27 December 1905. In ten years Butz had baptized two Tongans and twelve Europeans. Australia Butz accepted an invitation to move to Australia in 1906. He was president of the South Australia conference and the Tasmania conference, then in 1914 was appointed president of the Queensland Conference in succession to Charles H. Watson. Around the end of 1915 Butz publicly criticized some of the ministers in Queensland. He was rebuked for this by the Conference Executive Committee, but refused to apologize. Faced with the threatened resignations of several members of the committee, Butz resigned. Butz was later president of the Western Australian and North New Zealand conferences. For several years in the early 1920s he was preceptor and teacher of Bible and Physiology at Avondale College. The Butz‚Äôs retired to Melbourne. On 14 February 1929 Pastor and Mrs. Edwin S. Butz touched at Pitcairn on the passenger liner Remuera I, bound from Wellington to Southampton, after a 34-year absence. Edwin Butz died in July 1956 and Florence Butz in March 1957.

The city lay in a \\"wedge\\" of Ukrainian-held territory bordered by the DPR on one side, and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) on the other, and is a vital road and railway junction. Separatists began a concerted effort to force Ukrainian troops out of the city on 16‚Äì17 January, sparking the Battle of Debaltseve. Heavy fighting went on until 18 February 2015, when Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw. Background Debaltseve came under pro-Russian separatist control in April 2014, amidst widespread unrest across eastern and southern Ukraine in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Ukrainian forces managed to recapture the city on 28 July 2014, and continued to hold on to it firmly until January 2015. After the Minsk Protocol ceasefire agreement was signed on 5 September 2014, intermittent violations occurred around Debaltseve. Events Thousands of Ukrainian troops dug in at Debaltseve in January 2015. The city is a vital railway and road junction, and was sandwiched between DPR and LPR territories as a \\"pocket\\" or \\"wedge\\" of Ukrainian territory. Most residents had left by this time, with shops closed, schools abandoned, and houses damaged. Intermittent shelling of the city was common in the months preceding the January 2015 escalation. Heavy shelling, however, began on 17 January, and continued through 20 January. DPR forces attacked Ukrainian positions in the area around Debaltseve on 22 January. Heavy shelling continued into the next day, whilst Ukrainian forces continued to hold their positions in the city. An empty school building was hit by a shell during the fighting. In retaliation, Ukrainian forces began an artillery barrage on separatists positions outside the city. On the following day, the DPR vowed to retake Debaltseve, which was surrounded by DPR and LPR-controlled territory on three sides. According to a report on 24 January, a Ukrainian checkpoint near the city came under direct attack by DPR rebels. DPR forces attacked another Ukrainian checkpoint near Debaltseve on 25 January, but the attack was repelled. On the next day, such attacks continued, with heavy fighting taking place all around Debaltseve. A resident of the city told Reuters that Debaltseve had been almost completely surrounded by separatist insurgents, and that Ukrainian forces had managed to hold on despite constant attacks. =Separatist advance= Debaltseve to Artemivsk highway, surrounded by open steppe. Separatists attempted to enter Debaltseve on 27 January, this time from the direction of Horlivka, but were repelled. On the following day, a DPR commander said that his forces had captured the highway that leads into the city, and that the city had been nearly completely surrounded. However, Ukrainian member of parliament Dmytro Tymchuk said on 29 January that separatist forces had been forced to \\"scale back\\" their offensive in the Debaltseve area. According to him, an artillery counterattack by government forces had caused heavy losses amongst separatists that had been trying to cut off Ukrainian troops from Ukrainian-controlled territory. BBC News released a video that showed pro-Russian forces being caught in this shelling. Despite this, separatists captured Vuhlehirsk, a town west of Debaltseve on the highway to DPR-controlled Horlivka. The separatists broke through Ukrainian lines, overran a government checkpoint, entered the town, and then proceeded into its centre. Reinforcements were sent to aid government soldiers in Vuhlehirsk. According to an Associated Press report, the loss of this town made it much more difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold onto Debaltseve. Meanwhile, three civilians in Debaltseve proper were killed by what government forces described as \\"continuous\\" shelling by the rebels. During the day on 30 January, shells hit a bus, and also a cultural centre in Kyibishevskiy district that was being used to distribute humanitarian aid. According to the BBC, many civilians became trapped along with Ukrainian troops in the city. Some escaped to Artemivsk, in Ukrainian-controlled territory at the entrance to Debaltseve pocket. A report by Russian television channel Vesti said that around 8,000 Ukrainian troops remained in Debaltseve, and that separatist forces were close to closing the pocket's entrance. Ukrainian territorial defence battalion commander Semen Semenchenko said that some Ukrainian soldiers continued to hold out in Vuhlehirsk, despite the fact that it was largely under DPR control. Spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC) Andriy Lysenko said that reinforcements had arrived to relieve Ukrainian troops at Vuhlehirsk, and that the front line was holding. Over the course of the day, Ukrainian supply lines were nearly cut off, as Grad rocket fire made it difficult for armoured personnel carriers and lorries to travel on the north‚Äìsouth highway between Artemivsk and Debaltseve. At least seven civilians were killed when a Grad rocket struck a block of flats in the city. The remaining residents of Debaltseve began to attempt to evacuate from the city amidst increasing fighting. Three buses per day were arranged to take people out of conflict zone to Artemivsk. =Closing the \\"kettle\\"= Ukrainian T-64BV tank in the Debaltseve area Twelve more civilians were killed by DPR shelling of Debaltseve on 31 January. Concurrently, government forces continued to use artillery fire to cut-off DPR reinforcements from entering Vuhlehirsk. A ground offensive to dislodge separatists from that town failed, resulting in the deaths of three members of the Donbas Battalion, and injuring battalion commander Semenchenko. Evacuation of civilians from Debaltseve continued amid harsh winter conditions. As of that day, the city had been without water, gas, or electricity for at least ten days. According to Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at least 1,000 people had been evacuated from Debaltseve by 31 January. Ukrainian defence minister Stepan Poltorak confirmed that part of Debaltseve was under DPR control. On the first day of February, the situation in Debaltseve rapidly deteriorated. According to Kyiv Post, some units of the National Guard of Ukraine had been forced to flee as DPR forces pushed into the outskirts of the city. The situation in Debaltseve continued to worsen into 2 February. The New York Times reported that it appeared that the separatists could seize the Artemivsk highway \\"at any moment\\". The road had become nearly impassable, with multiple refugee-laden buses having been hit by artillery fire. Referring to the pocket of Ukrainian-held territory around Debaltseve as a \\"kettle\\", as became common, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that anyone that attempted to leave \\"the kettle\\" would be in the \\"interlocking field of fire of our artillery\\". A report by aid workers in the combat zone said that 8,000 residents had escaped from the Debaltseve area by 2 February. One aid worker said that pro-Russian forces were deliberately targeting the buses being used to transport residents out of the city. An observer with Amnesty International said that the humanitarian situation in Debaltseve had become \\"catastrophic\\". In order to assist the remaining Ukrainian troops in Debaltseve, the Armed Force sent a large column of reinforcements, including armoured vehicles and troop transports, from their base of operations at Kramatorsk to besieged Debaltseve. Map showing the Debaltseve operation A ceasefire between separatist and Ukrainian forces was agreed to for the day of 3 February. The stated intent was to allow remaining civilians to escape from the Debaltseve area. Shelling lessened until 13:00 EET, when salvos of Grad rockets began raining down on Debaltseve, in what appeared to be an attempt by separatists to raze it entirely. Fighting continued into the next day. One resident of Debaltseve who had fled to Artemivsk said that there was \\"nothing left\\" in the city. DPR forces gained control of Vuhlehirsk on 4 February, allowing the separatists to increase shelling of the Artemivsk highway and Debaltseve. DPR and Ukrainian forces agreed to establish a humanitarian corridor on 6 February, in another attempt to allow the remaining civilians to escape from Debaltseve. Hundreds of civilians were able to flee. Fighting resumed on 7 February. DPR forces said that they had fully encircled the town by capturing the village of Lohvynove on 9 February, thus \\"closing the kettle\\". Only four Ukrainian soldiers had been stationed in the village at the time, allowing the separatists to capture it easily. Government forces said that fighting was still ongoing on the Artemivsk highway, and that the kettle had not been completely closed. By the morning of 10 February, it became clear that separatist forces had gained control of the Artemivsk highway, thereby cutting off government forces. Videos showed DPR militants and tanks moving along the highway. During the day, the Lviv police chief was wounded in an explosion on a road near the town. Ukrainian forces took heavy casualties from artillery fire into 11 February. Nineteen soldiers were killed and seventy-eight injured in twenty-four hours. Those that died had been fighting near Hostra Mohyla hill, close to Debaltseve. In addition, DPR forces assaulted the Debaltseve police headquarters, killing the city's chief of police. =After Minsk II= Despite the signing of a new ceasefire agreement on 12 February 2015, fighting intensified around Debaltseve. Separatist forces attempted an offensive on Debaltseve proper in an effort to push out government troops before the start of the ceasefire, which was to come into effect at 0:00 EET on 15 February 2015. Heavy artillery barrages were reported to have struck the city, and the strategic Artemivsk highway was under intense shelling. Government troops made an attempt to recapture Lohvynove, but were ambushed by separatist militants. One Ukrainian soldier described the situation in the village as a \\"meat grinder\\" that was \\"worse than even those in Donetsk and Luhansk airports\\". At least 96 Ukrainian soldiers were wounded, whilst the number of dead was unknown because Ukrainian forces were forced to escape before they could remove the bodies of their comrades. Fighting continued along the Artemivsk highway into 14 February, as DPR insurgents continued their attempt to eliminate Ukrainian resistance. Donetsk regional chief of police Vyacheslav Abroskin said that intense shelling was \\"destroying Debaltseve\\". United States Department of State spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the Russian Armed Forces had deployed \\"a large amount of artillery and multiple rocket launcher systems around Debaltseve\\", and that Russia was responsible for shelling of the city. A report by The New York Times said that the Artemivsk highway had become completely impassable by 12 February, and that no one had travelled on it since that day. It also said that the road had been laced with land mines. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko ordered his forces to observe the ceasefire as it came into effect at 0:00 EET on 15 February, and insurgent commanders did the same. Though fighting ceased across most of the combat zone, it continued at Debaltseve. DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that Minsk II did not apply to Debaltseve, as it was not mentioned in the agreement. One Ukrainian soldier who was stationed at a checkpoint in the village of Luhanske, to the north of Debaltseve, said that there was \\"no ceasefire\\". During the course of 15 February, shelling struck Ukrainian positions, and separatist forces made multiple attacks upon the city from the west and east, storming government positions in the nearby village of Chornukhyne. Nevertheless, shelling in the area was less severe than it had been in the days prior to the start of the ceasefire. OSCE monitors, meant to observe the implementation of Minsk II, were denied access to Debaltseve by the separatist authorities. Fighting further intensified into 16 February, with \\"non-stop explosions\\" striking the city. Early in the day, the Debaltseve police station was destroyed by separatist shelling. Kryvbas Battalion deputy commander Yuriy Sinkovskiy said that Ukrainian soldiers in Debaltseve were either completely or partially surrounded, and that there was no available communication link to the Ukrainian General Staff. Soldiers subsisted in freezing conditions and had little food or ammunition. Sinkovskiy said that he risked being court-martialed for disclosing this information, and that he simply wanted to save the men that were trapped in Debaltseve. He said that the troops should withdraw or even surrender if it would save their lives. DPR commander Eduard Basurin said that he would provide a corridor to allow Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons and leave Debaltseve. Armed Forces spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said that this was unacceptable, and that Debaltseve was Ukrainian territory according to the Minsk agreements. Reuters described the ceasefire as \\"stillborn\\" in Debaltseve. One member of the Donbas Battalion said that the situation for Ukrainian soldiers in the city was dire, and resembled the \\"Ilovaisk kettle\\", but on a much larger scale. Separatist forces pushed into Debaltseve proper on 17 February. For the first time, fighting took place in the streets of the city. Separatist authorities said that they had captured the city's railway station, and also its eastern outskirts. The NSDC spokesman denied this, and said that fighting was ongoing throughout Debaltseve. Following this, the separatists said that they had captured most of the city, and were conducting a \\"mopping-up operation\\". They said they had taken at least 300 Ukrainian soldiers prisoner. A statement issued by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry confirmed that part of the city had fallen to \\"bandits\\", and that some soldiers had been taken prisoner. Ukrainian soldiers in the village of Komuna, just west of Debaltseve, told reporters that they could maintain their positions only for twelve more hours or they would be overrun and killed by the separatists. Concurrently, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military operation in Donbass said that Lohvynove and the Artemivsk highway had been returned to Ukrainian control. =Ukrainian retreat= Ukrainian forces began to withdraw from Debaltseve in the early morning on 18 February. Prior to the withdrawal, about 6,000 soldiers had been holed up in the city. Preparations for the retreat had been going on in secret for days prior. According to The New York Times, the leadership of the Ukrainian military operation had spent much time attempting to find a road to escape on, as the Artemivsk highway had become impassable. The situation in Debaltseve had become untenable for Ukrainian troops positioned there. One soldier said that if Ukrainian forces had stayed in the city, \\"it would definitely be either captivity or death\\". In order to find a usable route out of Debaltseve, ambulances were sent through \\"farmers' fields and down back roads\\", ensuring that such movements would not attract the notice of the separatists. Having selected a route north to the Ukrainian-controlled village of Luhanske, the withdrawal plan was put into action. Troop transports queued on the edge of Debaltseve at 01:00 EET. Soldiers were told to prepare to leave in ten minutes with no prior notice, and then to load into the prepared lorries. They abandoned their heavy weaponry, and destroyed their ammunition so as to prevent it from falling into separatist hands. After loading, the column of about 2,000 men, including tanks and other armoured vehicles, began to proceed away from the city. Headlamps were kept off to avoid attracting the separatist attention. In spite of these preparations, the convoy was swiftly attacked by the separatist forces. Vehicles broke down and crashed, with fire raining down on the convoy from all sides. One soldier said that the separatists were \\"shooting with tanks, rocket-propelled grenades and sniper rifles\\", and that the column had been \\"disintegrated\\". Many soldiers were forced to abandon their vehicles and proceed on foot. Dead and wounded soldiers were left behind, as it was impossible to evacuate them. The withdrawal was complicated by the fact that government forces had not gained control of Lohvynove, as had been claimed a day earlier. Donbas Battalion commander Semen Semenchenko said \\"All the fairytales about Lohvynove turned out to be fairytales\\". Streams of ragged Ukrainian soldiers who had left Debaltseve arrived in Luhanske as the day went on. The New York Times said that Ukrainian forces had suffered \\"major losses, both in equipment and human life\\". Debaltseve fell silent by 15:00 EET. The flag of Novorossiya was raised over a former Ukrainian base of operations. Separatist authorities said that they had taken hundreds of Ukrainian troops captive. Ukrainian officials told AFP that during the evacuation \\"Full-scale street fighting continues and there was also a small tank battle.\\" Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that the withdrawal had been \\"planned and organised\\", and that this orderly withdrawal proved that Debaltseve had been under Ukrainian control, and that \\"there was no encirclement\\". Soldiers on the ground, however, disputed President Poroshenko's account. Some soldiers said that \\"they had actually been told to stay put\\", and that they had been \\"left to die in a trap\\". They said that the Ukrainian government and media repeated \\"lies\\" about the status of Debaltseve, and that Ukrainian forces had been surrounded for more than a week. First Lt. Yuriy Prekharia, who had previously survived the encirclement of Ukrainian forces at Ilovaisk, said that Chief of the General Staff Viktor Muzhenko had repeated the same mistake, allowing Ukrainian forces to be trapped without support. He said that \\"The commanders should have given the order to break through and retreat as soon as the threat of encirclement became obvious\\". Commander Semenchenko likewise said: \\"The problem was with the leadership and coordination of actions ‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs going on now is the result of incompetent management of our troops, even though they‚Äôre trying to cover this up with a propaganda storm\\". President Poroshenko said that about 2,500 men had withdrawn from Debaltseve by the end of the day on 18 February, and this number represented 80% of the Ukrainian troops that had been in the city. Official reports said that thirteen soldiers had died during the retreat, and that 157 had been wounded. As above, soldiers on the ground disputed these numbers as grossly inaccurate, and said that the number of dead was \\"clearly in the hundreds\\". Two weeks later, the official casualty toll during the retreat was put at 19 dead, 12 missing, 9 captured and 135 wounded. Ukrainian government sources, on the other hand, reported that 185 soldiers had died during the battle, 112 had been taken prisoner, and 81 were missing. The Ukrainian death toll was later updated to 267 dead, after the bodies of many of the missing were found. Separatist leaders also said that their forces had captured a significant amount of Ukrainian heavy weaponry that had been left behind during the retreat. Some soldiers remained trapped in Debaltseve on 19 February, but soldiers that previously escaped said that they were forbidden from rescuing their trapped comrades. Separatist forces removed the last pockets of Ukrainian resistance in the Debaltseve area on 20 February, when they captured the villages of Chornukhyne, Ridkodub, Nikishyne and Mius.

History Nylonkong, from NY (New York City), Lon (London), and Kong (Hong Kong) first appeared in Time article A Tale of Three Cities in 2008. According to Time, these cities share similarities in cultural and economic establishments. They are influential in cultural industries, including art auctions, movies, and pop songs. In addition, the cities are top international financial centres located in different time zones. Time further described the cites as the three most remarkable international cities in the 21st century, and one could better understand the world through understanding Nylonkong.

It depicts two teams of oxen ploughing the land, and expresses deep commitment to the land; it may have been inspired by the opening scene of George Sand's 1846 novel La Mare au Diable. Commissioned by the government and winner of a First Medal at the Salon in 1849, today it is held in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris.  Depiction Charolais bull The Nivernais, the area around Nevers, was known for its Charolais cattle, which were to play an important role in the agricultural revolution that took place in the area in the nineteenth century.Shaffer 129-44. Rosa Bonheur gained a reputation painting animals, and Ploughing in the Nivernais features twelve Charolais oxen, in two groups of six. On a sunny autumn day they plough the land; this is the sombrage, the first stage of soil preparation in the fall, which opens up the soil to aeration during the winter. Humans play a minor role in the paintingHarris 198.‚Äîthe farmer is almost completely hidden behind his animals. The freshly-ploughed land is prominent in the foreground, while the landscape behind is basking in sunlight. The painting's clarity and light resembles that of the Dutch paintings (esp. by Paulus Potter) which Bonheur had studied as part of her education. According to Albert Boime, the painting should be seen as a glorification of peasant life and its ancient traditions; he places it in the context of the revolutionary year 1848, when cities were the scene of chaos and strife.Boime 622.  History Rosa Bonheur made the painting by commission of the French governmentCachin 331. for 3000 francs; it was shown in the Salon in 1849,Hird 67. where it won her a First Medal.Vizetelly 237. N. D'Anvers repeats an apparently well-known story, that it was inspired by the opening scene of George Sand's novel La Mare au Diable (1846), which features oxen ploughing a landscape with the author's commentary, \\"a noble subject for a painter\\". The comparison with Sand is amplified in an article in the July 1899 edition of The Literary Digest, which referred to the painting as a \\"pictorial translation of the novel\\". Initially intended for the museum in Lyon, it was instead exhibited in the Mus√©e du Luxembourg in Paris and was a featured exhibit at the 1889 World Fair. The painting was moved to the Louvre and afterward to the Mus√©e d'Orsay. She made a number of copies, one of which is in the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. Reception and legacy Constant Troyon, Boeufs allant au labour, effet de matin (\\"Oxen going to work, effect of morning\\"), 1855, Mus√©e d'Orsay. Rosa Bonheur was claimed by New York Times critic Mary Blume as \\"the most famous woman painter of her time, perhaps of all time\\". Besides The Horse Fair, Ploughing in the Nivernais is one of Bonheur's best-known paintings, and somewhat resembles Oxen going to work by Constant Troyon. An early admirer was Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, who copied the work in the Luxembourg before beginning a long acquaintance with the artist.Waters 197; George du Maurier's 1894 novel Trilby mentions such a scene, of people copying Ploughing in the Nivernais and other works in the Luxembourg.Du Maurier 308. It is one of the paintings singled out by Margaret Addison on her European tour in 1900,Addison 23. though philosopher Fr√©d√©ric Paulhan in L'Esth√©tique du paysage (1913) was less impressed; Paulhan argued that good art simplifies, and that Ploughing in the Nivernais does not do so, spoiling it with the execution of the clods of earth. Those clods and the greenery were done, according to Bonheur, in a \\"heartwarming\\" way, according to Paulhan; she did not create, but merely reproduced, since on the one hand she was too complete by providing too much insignificant detail, and on the other hand she weakened nature by reproducing it.\\"On peut voir au Luxembourg un grand et c√©l√®bre tableau de Rosa Bonheur, le Labourage nivernais, o√π les mottes de terre d√©tach√©es par la charrue, avec les herbes qui poussaient sur elles, sont rendues avec un soin attendrissant...Rosa Bonheur na pas vraiment cr√©√©.

Trop minutieusement, car elle nous donne beaucoup de d√©tails sans signification: trop incompl√®tement, car elle n'a fait qu'affaiblir la nature en la reproduisant\\": Paulhan 67. Paul C√©zanne was also unimpressed, commenting that \\"it is horribly like the real thing\\". In 1978 a critic described the work as \\"entirely forgotten and rarely dragged out from oblivion\\"; that year it was part of a series of paintings sent to China by the French government for an exhibition titled \\"The French Landscape and Peasant, 1820‚Äì1905\\". Mary Blume, in 1997, said \\"the work [Horse Fair as well as Ploughing] is more careful than inspired, affectionate but not sentimental, a doughty celebration of working animals\\".

Her major influences were the artists of the surrealism movement and Mexican muralism. She stated that one of her biggest influences was the work of Jes√∫s Guerrero Galv√°n. She was a founding member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, which was one of the first exhibitors of her work. Her work can be found in collections such as those of MacKinley Helm, Ali Chumacero, Licio Lagos, Bernard Lewin, and the Cant√∫ family. Biography Calero was born in 1906 during the Porfirio D√≠az regime, into a liberal and well-connected family. She was the granddaughter of Justo Sierra and cousin of Javier Barros Sierra . Her parents were Manuel Calero and Luz Sierra de Calero, who supported her artistic inclinations. Her family's wealth and social status made it relatively easy to develop her talent early. She was educated in the fine arts and culture, and learned to speak English fluently. During her childhood, she lost her hearing due to an illness . She married a distant cousin, Chano Urueta, who was a film actor and director. With Cordelia Urueta, she frequented cafes and other places popular with artists and writers, such as Renato Leduc, Xavier Villaurrutia, and Lu√≠s Cardoza y Arag√≥n. After her friend In√©s Amor opened a gallery in 1936, Calero met many artists of the Mexican muralism movement, and others such as the poets Antonin Artaud and Jos√© Moreno Villa . In the early 1930s, Calero and Urueta decided to move to the Colonia del Valle neighborhood, to a small house on San Francisco Street. Her landlady and neighbor, Luisa Garza, introduced her to painters and to other friends of her son, Federico Cant√∫ Garza. Cant√∫ and Calero began an affair that ended her marriage after various confrontations. The two married on June 12, 1937, a second marriage for both. From 1938 to 1941, Calero and Cant√∫ lived in New York City and later moved to San Miguel de Allende, dividing their time between Mexico and the United States. They were considered inseparable, and her image appeared in Cant√∫'s work, such as the Los Altares sculpture at the Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes .

They look more like fortresses with walls surrounding them and have restrained decoration and embellishment compared to both earlier and later Indian Islamic tombs. Their architecture lacks the influence from Hindu temple architecture and craftsmanship which was later found in Lodi and Mughal architecture. But Hindu influence on Tughlaq buildings was not totally absent. Features of Hindu influences on Tughlaq architecture include the flat lintel instead of pointed arch, pillars, windows with balconies and eaves and railings.Sir John Marshall, Cambridge History of India (Cambridge, 1928), III, 573 Tughlaqs built three main types of tombs: square, octagonal and pavilion.

After his death, his successor Muhammad bin Tughlaq, moved back to Delhi and left Tughluqabad to gradually crumble and decay, although the tomb of Ghiyas remains there in a very well preserved condition. = Architecture = The tomb was constructed in 1325 and is built of red sandstone and white marble, materials commonly used in Islamic structures at that time. It has a dome of white marble. It is considered to be one of the earliest masterpieces built of red sandstone and white marble. The square tomb is in the center of a pentagonal enclosure with high walls. There are entrances on the north, east and south sides. There are no Minarets surrounding the tomb. The architectural style of the tomb is inspired by the Khalji portal- Alai Darwaza- in the Qutb Minar complex. This is hardly surprising as Ghiyas was originally a Khalji slave who later became one of the governors. Tomb of Ghiyas ud-Din Khan A notable feature of the tomb are the sloping walls, at a 75 degree angle with the ground instead of vertical walls. This architectural style is similar to the sloping walls of the Hindola Mahal (Swing palace) in Mandu, Madhya Pradesh. It is so called because of the distinctive sloping walls which give an impression that the palace is swaying from side to side. Perhaps the wall design was intended to buttress the heavy stone arches that support the ceiling. The inside walls are vertical and plain. = Hindu Influences = The Ghiyas tomb exhibits peculiar Hindu influences in the form of a kalassa (pinnacle) on top of the white marble dome and a redundant stone lintel installed just below the arch. The kalassa adorns tops of most shikharas of ancient and modern Hindu temples in India. The pinnacle was planted at the apex of the Tughluq dome. The stone lintel was installed either to ensure stability, to fit a rectangular timber door in the arched opening, or purely for aesthetic reasons, to continue the white marble band along the facade. Whatever the reason for it, this 'architectural compromise' became an elegant and effective device in the building style of the Tughluqs as well as their successors.Contribution of the Firuzian Era to the Creation of Indo-Islamic Building Typologies by Prof. Aruna Ramani GroverAccording to Asaru‚Äôs-Sanadid by Sayyid Ahmad Khan: ‚Äúcorridors inside this tomb have been constructed in the style of Hindu architecture, and the pillars as well as the beams in the corridors are fully of Hindu fashion\\". Sayyid Ahmad Khan, Asaru‚Äôs-Sanadid, edited by Khaleeq Anjum, New Delhi, 1990. Vol I:p.97 = Graves = The Ghiyas tomb has three graves. The central grave is known to be that of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, other two belong to his son, Muhammad bin Tughluq and his wife, Makhdum-i-Jahan. The grave of Makhdum-i-Jahan must have been added later. There are no epigraphs of any sort. Graves inside the tomb = Tomb in Multan, Pakistan (Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam) = Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam, Multan, Pakistan The present day tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam is said to have been built by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq for himself during the days of his governorship under Ala-ud-din Khalji. It was later given by his son Muhammad, to the followers of Shah Rukn-e-Alam, a renowned Sufi saint of Multan, Pakistan. The mausoleum, built entirely of red brick, has the thick, sloping walls that characterise Tughluq architecture. The lower walls form a high octagon whose corners are marked by round and tapering buttresses. The second layer has smaller octagonal structure with a narrow, uncovered walkway on the second level. Surmounting this structure is a massive, hemispherical dome, that can be seen from miles away. In the 1970s the mausoleum was renovated.http://www.goplaces.in/blog/tughlaq-architecture  Firoz Shah Tughluq  Firuz Shah Tughluq has contributed to architecture in a similar manner as Shah Jahan did years later. However, Firoz's buildings were of simpler designs than those built earlier by the Khaljis. The coffers of the Treasury were almost empty when Firoz Shah took over. This meant he had to use simple design and cheap materials such as rubble and whitewashed plaster instead of the stone and marble combination. A few tombs built by Firoz shah are rarely ever mentioned as his name is more associated with townlike Yet the remains of the three tombs built by him in Delhi are still visible. These are: Fateh Khan's tomb, Firoz Shah's tomb, and the tomb of Khan-i-Jahan Tilangani = Tomb of Khan-i-Jahan Tilangani = Khan-i-Jahan Tilangani was the Prime minister of Firoz Shah. His tomb is the first octagonal tomb to be built in Delhi. Thus, it is of much historical and architectural significance, even though it is not a royal tomb. It is similar(but not identical) to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and Qubbat-i-Sulaibiya in Samarra. But the Tilangani tomb is built of different materials, grey granite and red sandstone, white marble and plaster instead of the enamelled tiles of the tomb in Samarra. It also suffers from design defects such as very low central and subsidiary domes, very low verandah arches and a lack of symmetry. These defects were gradually removed and this tomb became an inspiration for the later Sayyid and Lodi tombs.Sharma, Y.D. 2001. Delhi and its Neighbourhood. New Delhi: Directory General Archaeological Survey of India, 27, 118. = Firoz Shah's Tomb = Sultan Feroze Shah Tughlaq's tomb with adjoining Madrassa, in Hauz Khas Complex, Delhi  Location  Firoz Shah's tomb is located in Hauz Khas (New Delhi), close to the tank built by Alauddin Khalji. Attached to the tomb is a madrasa built by Firoz Shah in 1352-53. The entrance to the tomb is through a courtyard. The archway of the entrance gate has a date engraved on it- 1507-08, the reign of Sikandar Lodi, which suggests that he may have had the tomb repaired.  Architecture  The tomb is square in plan, heavy and massive in appearance with plain cemented walls unlike the marble on the facade of the Ghiyas tomb, and a slightly pointed dome supported by an octagonal drum. The lower curves of the dome arches are decorated with intersecting coloured bands. The arched pendentives contain Koranic inscriptions and the walls are decorated with floral designs. Firoz Shah's tomb differs from that of Ghiyas in the use of construction materials. Unlike the latter, it is not built of stone; instead a thick layer of durable stucco is used which was probably painted. It has a paved verandah, enclosed by Buddhist stone railings of the type found in Sanchi. It is not clear why these stone railings were used. One view is that Firoz Shah used these pre-Muslim Indian forms as a means of associating himself with earlier greatness.  Graves  There are no inscriptions on the four graves inside the tomb. It is believed that the central grave is that of Firoz Shah, and the two similar ones are probably those of his son, Nasir ud din Mahmud, and grandson, Ala-ud- din Sikandar Shah.

Late 19th century more of these journals also focussed the impact of engineering on technology and industry. The Engineering Magazine (1891) explained that \\"the magazine is founded upon the idea of treating only the principles involved in engineering problems ‚Äî which are always simple ‚Äî to the end that our circle of readers may embrace, in addition to professional men, the thousands of intelligent business men who are interested or actively engaged in the industrial enterprises of our times, but who are without technical training.\\"Engineering Magazine, Vol. 2 (1891), p. 280 Alexander (2008) recalled that the \\"Engineering Magazine was a witness to the workings of technical efficiency. Directed toward readers who were technically and mathematically trained it encouraged them to base their social contributions on professionalized status, primarily as mechanical engineers but also as physicists, civil engineers, and, increasingly after 1900, as industrial managers and governmental officials. Engineering Magazine came out monthly, each issue compact and dense, sitting heavy in the hand. It was composed of close-copy text, mathematical formulas and statistical charts and tables, alongside drawings and photographs of instruments, machines, and construction sites. Its reach was international and grounded in advanced formal training, its contributors' names often prefaced by the title \\"Professor.\\" Between 1907 and 1911 several leaders in the Progressive efficiency movement published the first versions of their seminal works in the Engineering Magazine: Harrington Emerson's Twelve Principles of Efficiency appeared in serial form from 1909 to 1911, and the magazine was among the first to publish Gantt's influential efficiency charts.\\"Jennifer Karns Alexander (2008) The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control. p. 82 = Organization as a system, early 1900 = In the first decade the Engineering Magazine made an important contribution to the codification and crystallization of the study of organizations.Yehouda Shenhav. \\"From Chaos to Systems: The Engineering Foundations of Organization Theory, 1879-1932,\\" in: Administrative Science Quarterly, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 1995), pp. 557 In 1906 the editors of the Engineering Magazine acknowledge this development: > It is almost exactly ten years since The Engineering Magazine laid down the > first clear definitions of that system of manufacturing which has come to be > known as distinctively American.

In 1877, he moved to Denver, Colorado, where he finished his education in construction and architectural drawing. He left thereafter for California, locating in San Francisco for two months before arriving in Los Angeles in the fall of 1878. He immediately opened up his office as an architect and general contractor. Los Angeles at that time was a thriving city of about 10,000 and there were only two other architects here. Within a short time, demands for plans and architectural drawings were coming in far faster than he could handle them, and he was obliged to give up his work in contracting entirely and confine his attention to architectural work. During this period of building \\"boom\\", he had 87 buildings under construction at one time. He was the resident architect of the new Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. and built many Catholic churches and schools in the diocese of Los Angeles and Monterey.

Originally it was an hour-long show (approx. 50 minutes excluding ads) but later was a half-hour show (approx. 25 minutes excluding ads, as can be seen on available episodes). It was hosted by Patti Page, who sang songs and introduced the guest performers. Most of the music was of the pop genre, although other styles of music were also featured, including jazz, rock and roll, and (very occasionally) country. Professional dancers also sometimes appeared as guests. In one episode (March 12 1958), the guests included Pearl Bailey, Hilo Hattie, The Four Voices and Florence Henderson. There were 26 hour-long episodes and 12 half-hour episodes. The series aired live, and kinescoped for west coast broadcast. It was one of the few CBS programs of the 1950s broadcast in color (during an era when arch- rival NBC was regarded as the leader in color telecasts). In the May 21 1958 episode, guest singer Jo Stafford mentioned the series being broadcast from New York City, and made a topical joke (regarding the baseball Giants and Dodgers relocating to California): \\"look at it this way, you haven't lost a ball team, you've gained a parking lot.\\" The Oldsmobile division of General Motors was the main sponsor, and some of the commercials featured Patti Page singing the Oldsmobile jingle. Florence Henderson appeared in some of the filmed ads for the cars. Due to the kinescope technology used to record the shows, a number of episodes with commercials intact still exist. Following the end of the series, Page did an additional series for Oldsmobile during the 1958‚Äì1959 television season (The Patti Page Oldsmobile Show). Reception Reviewing an episode, Billboard felt the series needed a more precise format, but also complimented Page's hosting and singing.

Among the conspirators were Counts Hendrik van den Bergh and Ren√© de Renesse, 1st Count of Warfus√©e, the only two of the conspirators to act. The plan came to nothing, but the existence of the conspiracy had a major impact on subsequent political developments, and the defection of Hendrik van den Bergh was a serious blow to the military leadership of the Army of Flanders and the prestige of the Habsburg dynasty. Only in 1634 did the Spanish government begin to gain a picture of the extent of the plot, through revelations made by Balthazar Gerbier, Charles I of England's resident agent in Brussels. On the basis of Gerbier's denunciations, Albert de Ligne, Prince of Barban√ßon, spent eight years in prison (1634‚Äì1642) without being brought to trial. The Duke of Aarschot, who had known of the plot but had dissuaded the conspirators, spent his final years under house arrest in Madrid for having failed to denounce it.

He served as Chaplain-General to the Forces from 1966 to 1974. Early life Youens was born on 29 September 1914 to Canon Fernley Algernon Youens. He was educated at Buxton College, a boys' grammar school in Derbyshire. Youens chose to follow his father in the Church. He trained for the priesthood at Kelham Theological College, a theological college that, unusually for the time, took non-graduates. He was ordained a deacon in the Church of England in 1939 at Southwark Cathedral. He was ordained a priest the following year. Military career Youens volunteered to join the military near the start of World War II. He was commissioned in the Royal Army Chaplains' Department, British Army, on 2 July 1940 as a Chaplain to the Forces 4th class (equivalent in rank to captain). During the war he served as a military chaplain in European theatre and the Middle East theatre. His experiences of working alongside wounded and dying men in the heat of battle allowed him to realise how ill-prepared chaplains were through their theological training for this line of work. He suggested the formation of battle-school to teach chaplains additional skills; this was acted upon and chaplains received additional, specialised training in the latter parts of the war. On 13 February 1943, he transferred from an emergency commission to a temporary commission. At the end of the war, he was an acting Chaplain to the Forces 3rd class (equivalent in rank to major). He remained in the forces after the end of the war. On 24 December 1945, he transferred from a temporary commission to a permanent commission and revered to the rank of Chaplain to the Forces 4th class. His first posting was as senior chaplain of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. There, he developed a regular session of religious and moral instruction for the officer cadets known as the 'Padre's Hours'. On 8 November 1948, he was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 3rd class. He was appointed senior chaplain to the Third Infantry Division. Under the command of Major General Lashmer Whistler, they were posted to Egypt as part of the Middle East Land Forces. Whistler himself was a devout Christian and instigated a trip to Mount Sinai for Youens and the other chaplains of the unit. There, Youens read out the Ten Commandments and then discussed with the other chaplains how best to minister to the soldiers under their care. When his unit relocated to Palestine, he arranged for trips to visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem and other biblical sites; over 7,000 soldiers benefited from this scheme. He was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 2nd class (equivalent in rank to lieutenant colonel) on 20 May 1953. In 1960, he was posted to Germany upon taking up the appointment of Assistant Chaplain General to the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). During that posting, he arranged a visit to the BAOR by the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Reverend Michael Ramsey. The Archbishop addressed a gathering of chaplains during his visit and thanked them for ministering to the soldiers and their families in a foreign country. He also noted the military's role at that point in the Cold War was as a forces in defence of peace. On 8 February 1966, he was appointed Chaplain-General to the Forces and promoted to major general. He succeeded Ivan Neill who later became Provost of Sheffield Cathedral. As Chaplain General, he was head of the Royal Army Chaplains' Department. Youens, as an act of ecumenism, appointed the Rev Dr David Whiteford, a minister of the Church of Scotland, as Deputy Chaplain-General. On 14 November 1973, he attended the Wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips held at Westminster Abbey; unusually, he was part of the visiting clergy because Phillips was a serving British Army officer. During his time as Chaplain-General, the first book of services and prayer was drawn up specifically for military chaplains and distributed across the forces. On 1 July 1974, he retired from the British Army. He was succeeded as Chaplain-General by Peter Mallett. Later life In 1978, Youens appeared before a Magistrate having been charged with 'insulting behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace'. Two police officers stated that they had seen him lift up a girl's skirt, behind whom he was standing, a number of times while watching a tennis match at Wimbledon. The girl was identified as 14 years old. Youens argued that he was in fact unconsciously exercising his left hand; he had undergone surgery on it two years before to cure Dupuytren's contracture and he needed to regularly exercise the hand to keep the circulation going. Having heard a character witness from General Sir John Mogg, the judge found him not guilty. Speaking to the press following the court hearing he stated: 'I'm absolutely delighted my name has been cleared and all I want to do is forget'. From 1982 to 1984, he served as Senior Treasurer of the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. He died on 24 August 1993, aged 78. He was cremated at a private service and no memorial service was held at his request. Personal life Youens was married to Pamela. Together they had three children; two daughters and a son. Youens officiated at the wedding of his son Richard in March 1972. His daughter Georgina was a London-based model. She was killed aged 22, when Turkish Airlines Flight 981 crashed near Paris on 3 March 1974. It is the fourth-deadliest plane crash in aviation history. She had been married to Piers Weld-Forester, a professional motorcyclist and royal courtier, who died in a motorcycle crash in 1977. Honours and decorations In January 1946, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) 'in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North West Europe'. In the 1959 New Year Honours, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). On 1 October 1963, he was appointed Honorary Chaplain to the Queen (QHC). In the 1970 New Year Honours, he was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).

Clark (born 26 July 1942) is a British-born American linguist. She earned her PhD in Linguistics in 1969, studying with John Lyons at the University of Edinburgh. She worked on the Language Universals Project at Stanford with Joseph Greenberg, and two years later, joined the Linguistics Department at Stanford University. She is currently the Richard Lyman Professor in the Humanities at Stanford. Clark's research focuses on first language acquisition, especially the acquisition of meaning. She has done extensive observational and experimental research. She has also worked on the acquisition and use of word-formation, including comparative studies of English and Hebrew in children and adults. Some of her current studies examine what children can learn about conventional ways to say things based on adult responses to child errors during acquisition. She has studied the pragmatics of coining words.  Awards  Eve V. Clark was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1979. She was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1983. She was elected as a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences/Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (KNAW) in 1991. She was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003. She was elected as a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science (APS) in 2007. In January 2017, Clark was one of the speakers in the Linguistic Society of America's inaugural Public Lectures on Language series.LSA Public Lectures on Language Series: http://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/lsa-public-lectures-language- series She is a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society.  Research  Eve V. Clark's work was focused heavily on first language acquisition, the acquisition of meaning, word-formation across children and language, and the varying issues in lexicon and language use. Some of her most remarkable studies come from the interaction of children with adults, where she demonstrates how vital these interactions are for further development of language for young children. =Young children's uptake of new words in conversation= Clark aimed to understand how children register words they haven't heard before by extracting the words and transcripts from five corpora (collection of written/spoken texts) (2007). She hypothesized that, because the repetition of a new word is how children place that word into their language, there will be a difference in repeat-rates for new information and given information. To test the prediction, she compared children's repetition's of the new words to the repetition in the new-to given conversation shifts. The study consisted of 701 new words that were used and exposed to the five children. An example of the way the words were said to the children are as followed: ‚ÄúDeictic term (this/that/here) + new word (This) is an + owl (Here) is a + whisk‚Äù (Clark & Wong, 2002) The five corpora, or collection of written/spoken speech, were analyzed by three researchers who each observed specific children: Stanley Kuczaj (child: Abe), Jacqueline Sachs (child: Naomi) and Roger Brown (children: Adam, Eve and Sarah). Each child was recorded at different intervals, ranging from twice a week to every other week. To analyze if the children are registering the new words, it was coded every time a child repeated the new word, acknowledged or moved on. Although the children all differed on who initiate the conversation first, her results found that 54% of the time, children repeated the word in their next turn, 38% of the time the child had utterances (move-ons) which were relevant to the new word and topic, and 9% of the time the children said ‚Äòyeah‚Äô (acknowledgement). Even though the children's acknowledgments were very small in terms of measurement, it displays that the children are capable of understanding and acceptance of the new words, a step forward in grounding the new terms that the adults offered. Children who moved on from the new word continued the conversation in the same semantic field, meaning that although the grasping of the new word may not be verbally recognized, the meaning behind the continued conversation displays a possible grasp on integrating the context into their understanding. From this study, Clark's results displayed that children repeated the new words about twice as much as they repeated utterance information from ordinary conversations. Her hypothesis was supported in that there is a difference in the function of repetition differs between new words and new information. Children are aware of new words, and rely on the introduction of them using the deictic frame. Clark wanted to continue this phenomenon of children and how they integrate these new words into their vocabulary, so she began to use words that young children surround themselves with everyday, but do not quite get exposed to in language, and that is color. =Color, reference, and expertise in language acquisition= Eve Clark furthered her research on children's understanding of new words, while focusing specifically on the knowledge and identification of colors. She discovered that children find difficulty in learning and understanding the label for each color, so her research led her to study tips to help children. Clark emphasized joint attention as a key piece of acquiring the terms for colors. When the child and the adult share the attention together, the child is able to learn colors, and furthermore, the complex shades and hues of that color. Along with joint attention, Clark found that in order for a child to learn the terms for colors, the child and adult must interact with conversation. Without direct attention, the child will struggle to grasp concepts on their own because there is nobody to tell them what is right or wrong. Furthering her explanation, Clark tells that a child must first learn the hue. Only after the child has grasped that concept can they start to learn the tints and shades. This concept specifically grows from the interaction with an adult. The child's understanding of the tints or shade of a hue increases when presented by older individuals around them. Eve Clark's research continues on as she explores how children acquire not only the understanding and meaning of words, but how they can use those words in context. =Conventionality and contrast in language acquisition= Eve Clark looks at how conventionality and contrast both add to language. Convention is defined as a norm, a standard everyone must follow to ensure proper communication. This rule is followed in terms of language as well as general knowledge. Everyone uses the same word to relay the same meaning, and mostly in the same way. When hearing a language for the first time, a child must figure out the meaning of the word in relation to the words around it. The contrasting words give hints to what the unknown word represents. With more context and exposure, children are able to make the connection and learn their first language. If a child and parent are at a zoo learning animals, learning the difference between two striped animals is where conventionality and contrast come in (tiger vs. zebra). While this rule can differentiate between nouns, this also applies when children figure out which tense of a verb to use (told vs. told). Conventionality and contrast are essential factors that help build on ones language acquisition, however, Clark also expands on how language acquisition actually can build on cognitive development as well. = How language acquisition builds on cognitive development = Clark's accomplishments and reputation in linguistics is shown in her ability relate language acquisition to cognition. She details that cognition and language are co-extensive and children first build on what they know before language, and then use language as well in constructing additional categories. Clark's concepts on cognition in relation to language acquisition reinforce that cognition and language interact in a cyclical fashion as children learn more. Clark expresses that words might be regarded as invitations to form categories and to individuate object kinds. Also, Clark believes that language might enable analogies that allow for greater complexity of thought. When discovering language, Clark says that children learn most from their adult figures in their life and how infants pick up on the most frequent nouns, verbs, and adjectives first before extending their range. This suggests that we as children, and as people in general, use representations based not only on representations linked to specific languages, but also on their cognitive development, for categorization, identification, sorting and remembering.

Increasing or decreasing one results in changes to one or both of the other two.

Criticisms of the Iron Triangle  Critics of the Iron Triangle state that the model is not actually as rigid as its name indicates, but is more dynamic because costs of care are constantly changing. Health care costs change faster than the other two dimensions of the triangle, affecting access to care, which in turn influences quality.Godfrey, T. (March 3, 2012). What is the Iron Triangle of Health Care? Retrieved January 18, 2015.

In line with Clayton Christensen‚Äôs theory on disruptive innovation, critics of the Iron Triangle believe that health care, particularly in the United States, has not yet been disrupted like fields such as computer production. The belief is that with time and innovation, the current Iron Triangle will be disrupted, and just as the cost of computer production has fallen as quality and access to computers has increased, health care access and quality will rise, and cost will decrease. Critics argue that the Iron Triangle is not a one-size-fits-all model that can be applied to an entire population.Department of Justice. (n.d.). Executive Summary: Current Health Care Challenges.

They all mean the same thing in German, ‚ÄúLittle Moor‚Äù, in honor of St. Maurice the Moor. The coat-of-arms of Joachim M√∂rlin shows a Moor‚Äôs head. ( ca 1490, Feldkirch, Archduchy of Austria, Holy Roman Empire ‚Äî 15 September 1550, Westhausen bei Hildburghausen, Electorate of Saxony ), was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wittenberg, the Lutheran pastor of Westhausen bei Hildburghausen, and a Reformer. He is famed as one of the first witnesses, allies and participants of the Reformation and as the father of two Lutheran theologians, Joachim M√∂rlin and Maximilian M√∂rlin.  Life  =Before the Reformation= Jodok M√∂rlin was born in or around 1490 in Feldkirch in the Vorarlberg,Although he was with the Reformation from the beginning, M√∂rlin was not the first Reformer to have come out of Feldkirch. When he came to Wittenberg in 1510, there was already a group of Feldkirchers studying and teaching there. They were led by Bartholom√§us Bernhardi ( 1487 ‚Äì 1551 ). He had made the trip to Wittenberg in 1504 with fellow Feldkirchers, Johannes D√∂lsch and Christoph Metzler, the future Bishop of Constance. Their biographies can be read online at ‚Äú Feldkircher Reformatoren [ Feldkirch Reformers ]‚Äù in Vorarlberg Reader. the westernmost part of the Archduchy of Austria. He was the son of Hugo M√∂rlin ( 1446 ‚Äì 1518 ) and his wife, Lucia Ebenko ( d. 1513 ), the grandson of Johann M√∂rlin, and the great-grandson of another Hugo M√∂rlin.Gruner, ‚ÄúMeine M√∂rlin- Vorfahren.Krau√ü, ‚ÄúDie M√∂rlin‚Äù, page 158. The name, Jodok, was not Germanic; it was Breton. Jodok might have gotten his rare name if he was baptized on 13 December, the feast day of St. Judoc, a 7th Century noble from Brittany.See G√ºnther Drosdowski, Duden Lexikon der Vornamen [ Duden Dictionary of Forenames ] ( Mannheim, Vienna and Z√ºrich : Dudenverlag, 1974 ), page 123, for more details. The Saint had been venerated in Germany since the 19th Century. According to Duden Lexikon der Vornamen, his name is a Celtic word for ‚Äúwarrior‚Äù. Nothing is known about his early years. But in 1508 he was studying at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, with Johann Eck as one of his teachers, and then, on a scholarship, at the University of Leipzig in 1509 and the University of Wittenberg in 1510. Here in Wittenberg his career was made. He graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree after only a few months in 1510 and a Magister‚Äôs degree in 1512 and became the Professor of Metaphysics in 1514 and then the Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1516, all at the University of Wittenberg.Clemen, ‚ÄúBriefe M√∂rlin‚Äù, pages 220 ‚Äì 221.‚ÄúFeldkircher Reformatoren‚Äù In 1517 and 1518, he taught an introductionary course about ‚Äúthe three principal languages, Latin, Hebrew and Greek, and the ‚ÄòLuther College‚Äô grammar [ der dreier vornehmsten sprach, der lateinischen, j√ºdischen und kriechischen, und der Kollege Luther grammatica ].‚ÄùFox, Drei Vorarlberger, pages 26 - 32. =During the Reformation= Three years after the beginning of the Reformation, in the spring of 1521, M√∂rlin was appointed as the pastor of Westhausen. His post had been left vacant in 1520 with the death of the last Catholic priest, Henningus Gode.Also known as Henningus of Havelberg, Father Gode, a native of Werben (Elbe) in the Electorate of Brandenburg, joined the University of Wittenberg in 1511 as a Professor of Law. He had been the Rector and a Professor at the University of Erfurt, from which he graduated in 1489 with a Doctorate in jurisprudence. See Richard Thiele, editor, Erphurdianus Antiquitatum Variloquus, Incerti Auctoris, [ Latin, Etymological Antiquities of Erfurt, Author Unknown ] ( Halle an der Saale, Saxony : Otto Hendel, 1906 ), page 149, footnote 5 for more details. By then, M√∂rlin was a presbyter at the Diocese of Magdeburg and already the Conventor [ parish administrator ] of Westhausen. He was recommended to replace Father Gode by Martin Luther and presented by two brothers, Frederick the Wise, the Elector of Saxony, and John the Steadfast, the Duke of Saxony, to the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Konrad von Th√ºngen. M√∂rlin was accepted and installed on 9 April 1521. By then, M√∂rlin already had a wife and at least five sons, including Joachim and Maximilian, so he was, as Luther had noted in March 1521, ‚Äúimpotent and very poor [ unverm√∂gend und sehr arm ]‚Äù, in need of a better income.In early 1521, Luther wrote three letters, all in Latin, to Georg Spalatin in an attempt to improve M√∂rlin‚Äôs career and financial prospects. They were dated 29 January, 17 February and 19 March. See Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette, Dr. Martin Luthers Briefe, Sendschreiben und Bedenken, Erster Theil [ Letters of Luther, First Part ] ) ( Berlin : Georg Reimer, 1825 ), pages 553, 559, 574 ff.; Ernst Ludwig Enders, Dr. Martin Luthers Briefwechsel, Band 3 : Briefe vim Dezember 1520 bis August 1522 [ Dr. Martin Luther‚Äôs Handwritten Letters, Volume 3 : From December 1520 to August 1522 ] ( Leipzig : Heinsius, 1889 ), pages 78 and 81; Karl Eduard F√∂rstemann, editor,Neues Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte der evangelischen Kirchen-Reformation [ New Book of Documents of the History of the Evangelical Reformation of the Church ] ( Hamburg : Friedrich Andreas Perthes, 1842 ), page 12, Item 20. The appointment did improve his financial prospects because Westhausen was one of the several parishes assigned to the University of Wittenberg so that the professors would have steady income from them. But, as both the pastor and a resident, M√∂rlin still had to deliver his parish‚Äôs annual fees to the University. He himself was not able to obtain his own exemption until 1528. So his financial problems continued, forcing his sons to learn their trades. Joachim was apprenticed as a potter, and Maximilian, as a tailor. Nevertheless, their father proved to be popular as a preacher. Residents came from all over the Heldburger Land to Westhausen to hear his sermons for years before they even got their own Lutheran pastors. This was precisely what the Elector and the Duke wanted, to limit the Catholic influence of the Prince-Bishops of W√ºrzburg over the Heldburger Land.Albert, ‚ÄúMagister M√∂rlin‚Äù, pages 68 - 70. In 1528, the Electorate of Saxony had its first Visitation of the East Country [ Ostland ] of Franconia. When the Visitors came to Westhausen, the parishioners told them that ‚Äúhe was doing all the hard work in the preaching of the Divine Word, and they had no lack of it, but they complained that he would be overcome with drink and pick fights [ er In predigung gotlichs worts allen vleis thue und hetten an Ime kein Mangel, allein wes er sich den trunk √ºberwindten und betryegen Iye√ü ]‚Äù.Georg Berbig, ‚ÄúDie erste kurs√§chsische Visitation im Osterland - Franken [ The First Visitation of the Electoral Saxony in the East Country of Franconia ]‚Äù, Archiv f√ºr Reformation-Geschlichte [ Archives of the History of the Reformation ], Vol. III, pages 377 ff. M√∂rlin, threatened with dismissal, promised to improve. In the following Visitations, he kept his word, and he was allowed to keep his offices. But he still had to keep a chaplain and pay him an annual salary of 40 guilders. =After the Reformation= M√∂rlin died in Westhausen on 15 September 1550 after 29 years as the town‚Äôs pastor. Family Jodocus was married twice. His first wife was Margarete, the daughter of the administrator of the Elector of Saxony‚Äôs vineyards, and she died in either 1514 or 1515. M√∂rlin then married Anna Hausknecht, perhaps a native of Wittenberg, in 1515 and they had 12 children, including two of their eight sons, Joachim and Maximilian.

It is an epithet for Varuna the god of water and its principle and as such are related to ‚Äòshatabhoisag‚Äô asterism. According to the puranas Prachetasa was one of the 10 Prajapatis who were ancient sages and law gives. But there is also a reference to 10 Prachetas who were sons of Prachinabarthis and great grandsons of Prithu. It is said that they lived for 10,000 years in a great ocean, very deeply engaged in meditation upon Vishnu and obtained from Him the boon of becoming the progenitors of mankind. They married a girl named Manisha, a daughter of Kanclu . Daksha was their son. But according to another version it is said that Prajapathi Daksha an ancient sage and contemporary of Lord Shiva, gave his 27 daughters in marriage to Soma ( Chandra). Soma was the son of father Atri and mother Anus≈´yƒÅ. But it is also said that Daksha was also the son of a woman called Marichi. Marichi is again referred to as the mother of Daksha. Thus it appears that Prachetasas were Daksha's fathers as well as Daksha's great-grandsons. This confusion arises in Hindu families essentially because children are often named after their grandfather or great grandfather. The above name of Prachetasa may not be confused with another sage named Prachetas who belonged to Treta Yuga (the period during which Lord Sri Rama appeared). This sage lived in a hermitage in a forest on the banks of river Ganga. It is said that he had a son named Agnisharma. He was converted into a devotee of Lord Sri Rama by the sage Narada.

On 23 June 2014, he was abducted by Ethiopian security forces while in transit in Yemen's Sana'a International Airport and was held in an unknown location in Ethiopia. The president of the Law Society and the chair of the Bar Council had urged the UK's Foreign Secretary to work to secure Tsege's release. On 29 May 2018, Andargachew was freed by the Ethiopian government. Early life During his high school years in Teferi Mekonnen School and later as an Mechanical Engineering student at Addis Ababa University, Tsege became very active in the student movement. Following the Ethiopian revolution of 1974 when a military dictatorship, Derg, seized power he joined the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and went underground, like most of the Ethiopian youth, in their struggle against the Marxist regime. During the Derg‚Äôs Red Terror campaign of 1974, his younger brother Amha Tsege was murdered by the security forces and Andargachew fled Ethiopia. Later, due to an ideological difference in the EPRP party, Tsege crossed into Sudan. In 1979 he was granted asylum in the United Kingdom (UK), where he later gained citizenship. In the UK he studied philosophy at University of Greenwich in the early 1980s and wrote his dissertation on the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Return to Ethiopia When Derg was overthrown in 1991, Tsege went back to Ethiopia to help the newly formed Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government led by his former university friend Meles Zenawi. Within two years, he was disillusioned with the ethnicity-oriented politics advocated by EPRDF and left the government. He moved back to London and started writing articles that were critical of the regime and its divisive politics.\\"Profile\\", Free Andargachew Tsege. 6 July 2014. The 2005 general election In 2005, Tsige returned to Ethiopia and published a book in Amharic which loosely translates to \\"Freedom fighter who does not know freedom\\", an analysis of the state of Ethiopian politics at the time. Soon, with an invitation from then deputy leader of Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) party Berhanu Nega, he joined the party and helped the party in the ill-fated election of May 2005. In June 2005, Tsige was imprisoned during the crackdown by the Ethiopian government after the election. After his release, he returned to London, where he was able to campaign against the regime by testifying at different government or international organisations including the US congress and European Union Human Rights committee as well as think tanks such as Chatham House. He became the principal spokesperson for the CUD party in exile and was instrumental in mobilizing the global Ethiopian diaspora for a worldwide campaign to secure the release of the CUD leaders and all prisoners of conscience. Post 2005 general election In May 2008, he founded Ginbot 7 Movement for Justice, Freedom and Democracy with Berhanu Nega, one of the exiled leaders of CUD. He was elected as Secretary General of Ginbot 7. On 22 December 2009, an Ethiopian court sentenced Tsige to death, in absentia, while 33 others were sentenced to life in prison along with four others who were also sentenced in absentia. On 7 November 2013, Ginbot 7 claimed it foiled an assassination plot that targeted Tsige, secretary of Ginbot 7, as well as commanders and high-ranking officers of Ginbot 7 Popular Force. On 23 June 2014, he was once again imprisoned by the Ethiopian regime. He was arrested by Yemeni security forces, in collaboration with Ethiopian intelligence service members, at Yemen's Sana'a International Airport while in transit from the United Arab Emirates to Eritrea. He was detained in an unknown location and no official statement was forthcoming from either the Yemeni or Ethiopian governments. In February 2015, an early day motion was tabled within the UK parliament, recognising Tsige's 60th birthday, and calling for pressure to be applied to the Ethiopian government, in order to secure his release. In October 2016 Tsige's family wrote to ex British Prime Minister Tony Blair to use his \\"advisory role with the Ethiopian government\\" to call for Tsige's release. Blair's Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative had an embedded team of advisors in Ethiopia. In October 2017, it was reported that both the president of the Law Society and the chair of the Bar Council had urged the UK's Foreign Secretary to work to secure Tsege's release. On 19 May 2018, Andargachew was pardoned by the Ethiopian government along with 575 other prisoners. On 29 May 2018, he was reported to have been released from prison, resulting in celebrations in the city of Addis Ababa.

Though its definition has varied with time and context, it is generally accepted among historians that North Chennai is used for the part of Chennai city situated north of the Coovum River. Encompassing the Fort St George and Georgetown areas from which the city originated, North Chennai is generally considered an area of stagnant growth that has already reached saturation as a real estate choice. The area is generally notorious for its thick population, narrow roads, poor infrastructure, and high incidence of crime. This characterization is, however, limited to older neighbourhoods close to the sea coast as new areas to the west, like Kilpauk, Anna Nagar and Ambattur have good standards of living and acquired desirability as residential areas. Northwards of Georgetown, extends the Anglo-Indian settlement of Royapuram and the historical town of Thiruvottiyur beyond which it degenerates into a series of fishing hamlets or kuppams . The puzhal Lake located Red Hills and famous central prison. The port of Ennore located 16 kilometres supplements Chennai Port as a major entrepot for trading vessels. Northwards lie Minjur, Ennore and Thiruvottiyur. Westwards lie the industrial suburbs of Padi, Ambattur Avadi and Thiruninravur . The head office will be at Tondiarpet, was comprise Tiruvottiyur, Tondiarpet, Madhavaram, Perambur and Purasawalkam taluks.  History  North Chennai originated with the founding of an East India Company factory in the village of Madrasapatnam. The grant was confirmed on 22 August 1639 which is generally considered the date of the city's founding and celebrated as Madras Day and the signatories were Francis Day for the East India Company and Damera Venkata Nayaka a Padmanyaka Velama ruler for the Vijayanagar Empire. The construction of a small fort was started in 1640 and completed by 1652. This would, by the end of the 18th century, with significant alterations and expansions, become the Fort St George that we know today. Prior to the city's founding, fishing hamlets existed in the area. Georgetown remained a fashionable residential area till the early 1900s when congestion and lack of cleanliness compelled people to look for areas further south. It was also Chennai's Central business district till the 1950s when it was supplanted by T. Nagar.

In theory, she accepts a life being his partner in crime, even if doing so results in her own death. The term may have originally come from biker culture where \\"ride\\" was defined more literally and a biker chick would stand by her man. The meaning changed so that \\"ride\\" would be defined more broadly and a woman would be willing to \\"ride\\" out any problems or else die trying. Use in hip-hop music The \\"ride or die chick\\" trope is invoked by both men and women in hip hop with men stating their desire or love of ride or die chicks and women identifying themselves as willing to ride or die. Many of these songs are duets between male and female artists and contain both of these perspectives within the same song. The song to popularize the \\"Ride or Die\\" outlook on life was \\"Ride or Die\\" by Baby Gangsta featuring Lil Wayne and Juvenile. The song, released in 1997, was on Baby Gangsta's third studio album It's All on U, Vol. 2. It was produced by Mannie Fresh. Jay-Z and the Ruff Ryders advanced the term into the mainstream, in 1998 and 1999 respectively, with the songs \\"Ride or Die\\" on Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life and \\"Ryde or Die\\" on Ryde or Die Vol. 1. However, the first mainstream rap song to advance the notion of a woman being \\"down\\" to \\"ride or die\\" with the lifestyle, was \\"The Bonnie and Clyde Theme\\" by Yo Yo in a duet featuring Ice Cube, on her third studio album You Better Ask Somebody, released in June 1993. The popularization of the term \\"Ride or Die Chick\\" did not enter mainstream hip-hop until The Lox released a duet with Eve, \\"Ryde or Die, Bitch,\\" on the 2000 album We Are the Streets. The song was produced by Timbaland. Other examples of the term in hip-hop include: *\\"'03 Bonnie and Clyde\\" by Jay-Z ft. Beyonce *\\"Hail Mary,\\" Tupac Shakur (as Makaveli) *\\"Dog Match\\" by Eve ft. DMX *\\"Down Ass Bitch\\" by Ja Rule ft. Charli Baltimore *\\"You're All I Need\\" by Method Man ft. Mary J Blige *\\"Boss Bitch\\" by Mac ft. Mia X *\\"Ryda\\" by The Game ft. Dej Loaf *\\"Bottom Bitch\\" by Rafael Casal *\\"Rider\\" by Future (feat. Tasha Catour) *\\"#HoodLove\\" by Jazmine Sullivan *\\"R.O.D.\\" G-Dragon (feat. Lydia Paek) * \\"Him & I\\" by G-Eazy and Halsey * \\"Rider Chick\\" by Lil Durk ft Dej Loaf *\\"Ride or Die\\" by Nova (feat.Nia Kay) *\\"We Ride\\" by Gucci Mane (feat.Monica) *\\"Ride or Die\\" by Fetty Wap (feat.Jhonni Blaze) *\\"I Do\\" by Young Jeezy feat. Jay-Z and Andr√© 3000 Use in hip hop discourse =Within celebrity culture= This term is sometimes used to describe the lives and decisions of women in the hip hop community. In their interview with Tashera Simmons following the announcement she was divorcing DMX, Essence magazine referred to her as \\"having a reputation for being the ultimate ride or die chick,\\" citing her support of DMX despite his jail time, drug use, and infidelity. Lil' Kim was also called a ride or die chick after she went to jail for perjury for lying to a jury about her manager regarding a shootout involving several rappers. While the term usually implies drama and danger, this is not always the case. For example, Gabrielle Union was described as a ride or die chick for her public and vehement defense of her husband Dwyane Wade after his talent was criticized by basketball player/analyst Charles Barkley. The term is even sometimes used a shorthand for any heterosexual commitment in the hip hop community, as was the case in the Philadelphia Tribune's statement that Beyonce and Jay-Z were ride and die after they renewed their wedding vows. =Outside of celebrity culture= The term is frequently used negatively outside of celebrity culture. Blogs targeting young Black members of the \\"hip hop generation\\" as their demographic, such as Hello Beautiful, Hall of the Black Dragon, and Urbanbellemag.com, have all published articles that advise women to be wary of attempting to be a ride or die chick at the expense of their own happiness and health. These articles argue women need specific boundaries in their romantic relationships and dismiss the idea of limitless loyalty as either unrealistic myth or facilitating abuse and disrespect. However, this negative perspective is not universal. The website singleblackmale.com, which claims to represent the \\"urban male perspective\\", tells women specific ways they can achieve ride or die status that vary from \\"being down for the cause\\" to \\"either watch sports...or get out and leave (your man) alone.\\" Academic response =Defense of term= Black feminist scholar Treva Lindsey claims the ride or die chick is a challenge to a dominant narrative in hip hop that privileges homosocial male relationships and undermines heterosexual romantic bonds between men and women. Drawing on scholars Patricia Hill Collins and bell hooks she argues this love is not only personal, it is also an act of political rebellion because \\"In a culture that claims black women are unlovable and undesirable, and black men are violent and irredeemable, it is considered \\"rebellious\\" when black men and women love each other.\\" Others have also argued that the \\"ride or die\\" narrative is a recognition of the disenfranchisement these couples face because of race and class and it is because of this systematic oppression that they feel it is them against the world. In this understanding by claiming to be a ride or die chick, a woman is not diminishing her own self-worth or inviting mistreatment, but symbolically invoking a politically-aware alliance. Her recognition that committing to this relationship will require her to ride or die is a statement about the difficulty her partner will likely face as a Black man living an illicit lifestyle. Another favorable understanding of the trope argues its meaning is flexible and can positively evolve. For example, one definition of this term claimed \\"for a 30+ year old man, who has his ish together, a down ass chick is someone who is down for you in other ways...Both versions are loyal and have your back but... the 30+ DAC is not willing (nor required) to sacrifice herself or her goals for her man. They are building together.\\" =Critique of term= Despite these positive readings and the fact that ride or die chicks are often the subject of male praise or female self-identification in hip hop, they have also been critiqued as a negative and damaging ideal imposed on Black women. Critics have argued that ride or die chicks are a heterosexual male fantasy that privileges male pleasure and ignores the costs women must pay to fulfill this fantasy. Hip hop feminist author Gwendolyn D. Pough claims the rising number of Black women in prison, currently the fastest-growing prison population, is evidence of the high cost ride or die chicks must pay. The ride or die chick can also be understood as a hip hop reiteration of the Madonna‚Äìwhore paradigm. In this understanding the ride or die chick is the Madonna and her opposite is the trick/hoe. Unlike the \\"Madonna\\", the ride or die chick is sexualized (casting doubt on this very comparison), but unlike the trick/ho, her sexuality is praised and valued. The ride or die chick is not seen as sexually deviant because her partner is the only man with access to her body. Like the Madonna/Whore, in this schema women's sexuality is only for male pleasure and is limited to fulfilling one of two restrictive opposing roles. Also like the Madonna/Whore, in this understanding the ride or die chick is a sexual script although, unlike Madonna/Whore it is specific to Black women. In an interview, hip hop activist Toni Blackman noted that it is not the sexuality of these scripts she is troubled by, but that \\"woman's choices are only limited to A, B and C. When a guy gets to choose between ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP.\\" In this critique the problem with the ride or die chick is not its specific meaning but its place as one of several stereotypes, or scripts, that supposedly represent the entirety of Black female behavior.

It was located on rue Tenant de la Tour in the Shanghai French Concession. The synagogue was closed in 1965 after the departure of most Jews from Shanghai following the Communist victory in China, and was repurposed as the auditorium of the Shanghai Institute of Education. It was demolished in the 1990s. History The New Synagogue was built by the Russian Jewish community of Shanghai. During the 1930s, the number of Russian Jews in the city increased to more than 4,000, exceeding the capacity of the existing Ohel Moshe Synagogue in Hongkew. After years of fundraising and construction under the leadership of Rabbi Ashkenazi, the synagogue was opened just in time for Passover in 1941. Ashkenazi served as its rabbi, and the Shanghai Ashkenazi Jewish Communal Association (SAJCA) also moved to the New Synagogue. It was located at 102 rue Tenant de la Tour (Ladu Lu in Chinese, now South Xiangyang Road) in the Shanghai French Concession, and was commonly called the Tenant de la Tour or Ladu Synagogue. With a capacity for 1,000 people, the New Synagogue was described as a \\"grand\\" and \\"splendid\\" building. The Japanese, who had occupied the Chinese sections of the city since the 1937 Battle of Shanghai, provided tons of cement, a precious commodity during the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War, for the foundation of the New Synagogue. Soon after the synagogue was opened, however, the Pacific War broke out on 8 December 1941. The Japanese army occupied the Shanghai French Concession and the Shanghai International Settlement, and took over the synagogue for their own use. It was returned to the Russian Jewish community after the end of World War II. With the eruption of the Chinese Civil War and the subsequent establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Jewish population in Shanghai plummeted. In the 1960s, the New Synagogue became the \\"united\\" synagogue for all Jews, both Ashkenazim and Sephardim, still remaining in the city. It finally closed in 1965. The synagogue was later used as the auditorium of the Shanghai Institute of Education. It was demolished in the 1990s.

He had become known for his work on the Barack Obama presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012, as a member of the paid media team. Shepardson's marketing communications firm, SS+K was tasked with registering and winning the support of millennials (18- to 34-year-olds). In 2008, 66% of those under 30 voted for Barack Obama. In 2012, 1.25 million more millennials voted for Obama than in 2008, tipping swing states such as Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio in his favor. Shepardson is a co- founder and partner of SS+K, a New York-based advertising agency. In addition to political work, the firm also has non-profit clients that include the LIVESTRONG Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Bono's ONE Campaign, as well as numerous corporate clients that include HBO, Starbucks, Wells Fargo and The New Yorker. Strategy for reaching millennials Shepardson maintains that young voters have little trust in Washington, D.C., regardless of the political party in power. ‚ÄúMillennials will align with somebody regardless of political labels, based on values. Communicate through issues, not through the candidate,‚Äù he advises. ‚ÄúNegative ads and politics-as- usual can turn millennials off. They are quite shrewd when it comes to marketing.‚Äù The best strategy to reach them, he suggests, is to ‚Äúsell a politician by not being political.‚Äù Political communications Examples of Shepardson's political communications work with SS+K include: *Your First Time (2012) ‚Äì Targeting first-time voters, this tongue-in-cheek campaign for the Obama presidential campaign featured a video of author and director Lena Dunham, who slyly compared voting to losing one's virginity. \\"Your first time shouldn‚Äôt be with just anybody,\\" Dunham says. \\"You want to do it with a great guy.\\" TIME Magazine called the Dunham spot the \\"most memorable ad of the 2012 campaign.\\" The video won a Digiday Sammy Award for \\"Best Branded Viral Video.\\" The sexual innuendo was both applauded and condemned along party lines, with liberal commentators cheering the humor and conservatives calling it ‚Äútasteless.\\" *For All (2012) ‚Äì SS+K developed a second campaign in 2012 called \\"For All\\" that included video, social media and print ads. It invited young voters to write an issue they cared about on their hand, photograph it and share it on Instagram. This campaign won a Digiday Sammy Award for ‚ÄúBest Social Engagement Campaign.‚Äù *Democratic National Committee Rebranding (2010) ‚Äì The agency redesigned the Democratic National Committee logo, moving away from a kicking red, white and blue donkey to a bold blue \\"D\\" inside a thick blue circle with the slogan \\"Change That Matters.\\" *Obama for America Youth Campaign (2008) ‚Äì SS+K developed the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Get Mad, Vote‚Äù campaign in 2008. It drove young voters to VoteForChange.org, the Obama campaign's voter registration site. On Election Day 2008, Barack Obama won the highest percentage of the youth vote (66 percent) since exit polling began in 1972. The Obama campaign, including the paid media team of which SS+K was a member, won the Cannes Titanium and Integrated Gold Lion advertising awards.  Advocacy campaigns  Shepardson has led SS+K's work for issue campaigns and nonprofits, including: * LIVESTRONG Foundation (formerly the Lance Armstrong Foundation) ‚Äì To empower cancer survivors through advocacy and support programs. * FWD.us ‚Äì Founded by Mark Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley executives, supporting comprehensive immigration reform. * Share Our Strength - To eliminate childhood hunger in the United States through the No Kid Hungry campaign. * Sandy Hook Promise ‚Äì Founded by parents of the victims of the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, to protect children from gun violence. * Let's Move! ‚Äì Founded by First Lady Michelle Obama, a first- of-its-kind campaign to reduce childhood obesity in a generation. * Enough! ‚Äì Housed at the Center for American Progress, an advocacy campaign to fight genocide. * Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ‚Äì To improve the quality of lives for individuals around the world through issues including global health and education. * ONE Campaign ‚Äì Co-founded by Bono, the advocacy campaign to reduce extreme poverty and preventable disease, especially in Africa. In addition, Shepardson has led SS+K's work for many commercial clients, including the recent, award-winning campaign for HBO called \\"Awkward Family Viewing,\\" promoting the HBO Go service to college students. The campaign won multiple media accolades, and some of the advertising industry's top awards, including five Cannes Lions and 11 One Show Pencils.  Public service appointments  In 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Shepardson to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition (PCFSN), along with NBA players Jason Collins and Alonzo Mourning, celebrity chef and talk show host Rachael Ray, and ballet dancer Misty Copeland. Shepardson is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and several business and charitable boards, including the New York advisory board of Enterprise Community Partners (ECP) and the advisory board of the Center for Health Communication at Harvard University's School of Public Health. He developed and taught a graduate-level course on health issue advocacy at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in 2003 and 2004.  Career  With fellow political consultants Lenny Stern and Mark Kaminsky, Rob Shepardson founded the New York City-based advertising and communication agency SS+K in 1993. In November 2014, SS+K sold a 33% stake to international advertising agency M&C; Saatchi. From 1987 to 1993, Shepardson was a managing director at the Sawyer/Miller Group, an international political consulting firm. Prior to joining Sawyer/Miller, Shepardson worked as a special assistant to future Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell when Rendell was District Attorney in Philadelphia.  Personal  Shepardson received a B.A. from Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa. and an M.P.P. from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Shepardson was inducted into the Franklin & Marshall Sports Hall of Fame, having set a number of records as a four-year starting quarterback. Shepardson finished the 2014 Boston Marathon in 3:36.

Plant Signaling & Behavior. 9(1). e27700 but also contribute to secondary metabolism.Schluttenhofer and Yuan (2014) Regulation of Specialized Metabolism by WRKY Transcription Factors. Plant Physiology. Like many transcription factors, WRKY transcription factors are defined by the presence of a DNA- binding domain; in this case, it is the WRKY domain. The WRKY domain was named in 1996 after the almost invariant WRKY amino acid sequence at the N-terminus and is about 60 residues in length. In addition to containing the ‚ÄòWRKY signature‚Äô, WRKY domains also possess an atypical zinc-finger structure at the C-terminus (either Cx4-5Cx22-23HxH or Cx7Cx23HxC). Most WRKY transcription factors bind to the W-box promoter element that has a consensus sequence of TTGACC/T. Individual WRKY proteins do appear in the human protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia and slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum.Wu, Guo, Wang and Li (2005) The WRKY Family of Transcription Factors in Rice and Arabidopsis and Their Origins. DNA Research. 12(1). 9-26 Structural diversity WRKY transcription factors are denoted by a 60-70 amino acid WRKY protein domain composed of a conserved WRKYGQK motif and a zinc-finger region.Eulgem, Rushton, Robatzek and Somssich (2000) The WRKY superfamily of plant transcription factors. Trends in Plant Science. 5(5). 199-206 Based on the amino acid sequence WRKY transcription factors are classified into three major categories, group I, group II, and group III. Group I WRKY proteins are primarily denoted by the presence of two WRKY protein domains, whereas both groups II and III each possess only one domain. Group III WRKY proteins have a C2HC zinc finger instead of the C2H2 motif of group I and II factors. The structure of several plant WRKY domains has been elucidated using crystallography Duan, Nan, Liang, Mao, Lu, et al. (2007) DNA binding mechanism revealed by high resolution crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY1 protein.

(2012) Structural Basis for Sequence-specific DNA Recognition by an Arabidopsis WRKY Transcription Factor. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 287(10). 7683-7691 The different groups of WRKY Domains in flowering plants As soon as the WRKY domain was characterized, it was suggested that it contained a novel zinc finger structure and the first evidence to support this came from studies with 2-phenanthroline that chelates zinc ions. Addition of 2-phenenthroline to gel retardation assays that contained E. coli expressed WRKY proteins resulted in a loss of binding to the W-box target sequence. The other suggestion was that the WRKY signature amino acid sequence at the N-terminus of the WRKY domain directly binds to the W-box sequence in the DNA of target promoters. These suggestions were shown to be correct by publication of the solution structure of the C-terminal WRKY domain of the Arabidopsis WRKY4 protein. The WRKY domain was found to form a four-stranded Œ≤-sheet.Yamasaki K, Kigawa T, Watanabe S, Inoue M, Yamasaki T, Seki M, Shinozaki K and Yokoyama S (2012) Structural basis for sequence-specific DNA recognition by an Arabidopsis WRKY transcription factor. J Biol Chem 287: 7683‚Äì7691 Soon afterwards, a crystal structure of the C-terminal WRKY domain of the Arabidopsis WRKY1 protein was reported. This showed a similar result to the solution structure except that it may contain an additional Œ≤-strand at the N-terminus of the domain.Duan MR, Nan J, Liang YH, Mao P, Lu L, Li L, Wei C, Lai L, Li Y and Su XD (2007) DNA binding mechanism revealed by high resolution crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY1 protein. Nucleic Acids Res. 35:1145-1154 From these two studies it appears that the conserved WRKYGQK signature amino acid sequence enters the major groove of the DNA to bind to the W-Box. Recently, the first structural determination of the WRKY domain complexed with a W-Box was reported. The NMR solution structure of the WRKY DNA-binding domain of Arabidopsis WRKY4 in complex with W Box DNA revealed that part of a four-stranded Œ≤-sheet enters the major groove of DNA in an atypical mode that the authors named the Œ≤-wedge, where this sheet is almost perpendicular to the DNA helical axis. As initially predicted, amino acids in the conserved WRKYGQK signature motif contact the W Box DNA bases mainly through extensive apolar contacts with thymine methyl groups. These structural data explain the conservation of both the WRKY signature sequence at the N-terminus of the WRKY domain and the conserved cysteine and histidine residues. It also provides the molecular basis for the previously noted remarkable conservation of both the WRKY amino acid signature sequence and the W Box DNA sequence.Eulgem T, Rushton PJ, Robatzek S and Somssich IE (2000) The WRKY superfamily of plant transcription factors. Trends Plant Sci 5:199-206 History The first WRKY transcription factor, (SPF1), was identified in 1994 for its involvement in sucrose regulation of gene expression in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas).Ishiguro and Nakamura (1994) Characterization of a cDNA encoding a novel DNA-binding protein, SPF1, that recognizes SP8 sequences in the 5‚Ä≤ upstream regions of genes coding for sporamin and Œ≤-amylase from sweet potato. Molecular and General Genetics MGG. 244(6). 563-571 A year later, two WRKY transcription factors, ABF1 and ABF2, established the role of WRKY proteins as a novel family of transcriptional regulators.Rushton, Macdonald, Huttly, Lazarus and Hooley (1995) Members of a new family of DNA- binding proteins bind to a conserved cis-element in the promoters of Œ±-Amy2 genes. Plant Molecular Biology. 29(4). 691-702 In 1996 three parsley (Petroselinum crispum) WRKY transcription factors (WRKY1, WRKY2, and WRKY3) were identified for their role in regulation of the PATHOGENESIS RELATED1 gene.Rushton, Torres, Parniske, Wernert, Hahlbrock, et al. (1996) Interaction of elicitor-induced DNA-binding proteins with elicitor response elements in the promoters of parsley PR1 genes. The EMBO Journal. 15(20). 5690 This was the first of many studies identifying WRKY transcription factors in regulating gene expression for plant defense. By 2000 a review paper published identifying the WRKY transcription factor family in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (commonly called mouse-ear cress or thale cress) lead to a widespread investigation of WRKY family members.Eulgem, Rushton, Robatzek and Somssich (2000) The WRKY superfamily of plant transcription factors. Trends in Plant Science. 5(5). 199-206 Since then WRKY transcription factors have been extensively investigated for stress tolerance in many agronomic and horticulture crops. In 1994 and 1995, the first two reports of WRKY transcription factors appeared. They described newly discovered but as yet ill-defined DNA binding proteins that played potential roles in the regulation of gene expression by sucrose (SPF1) Ishiguro, S. and Nakamura, K.

Biol. 29, 691‚Äì702 A third report appeared in 1996 that identified WRKY1, WRKY2 and WRKY3 from parsley. The authors named the new transcription factor family the WRKY family (pronounced ‚Äòworky‚Äô) after a conserved amino acid sequence at the N-terminus of the DNA- binding domain.Rushton, P.J., Torres, J.T., Parniske, M., Wernert, P., Hahlbrock, K. and Somssich, I.E. (1996) Interaction of elicitor-induced DNA- binding proteins with elicitor response elements in the promoters of parsley PR1 genes. EMBO J. 15, 5690‚Äì5700 The parsley WRKY proteins also provided the first evidence that WRKY transcription factors play roles in regulating plant responses to pathogens. Numerous papers have now shown this to be a major function of WRKY transcription factors. Since these initial publications, it has become clear that the WRKY family is among the ten largest families of transcription factors in higher plants and that these transcription factors play key roles in regulating a number of plant processes including the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, germination, senescence, and some developmental processes.Eulgem, T. and Somssich, I.E. (2007) Networks of WRKY transcription factors in defense signaling. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 10, 366‚Äì371, Ulker, B. and Somssich, I.E. (2004) WRKY transcription factors: from DNA binding towards biological function. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 7, 491‚Äì498 Evolution The WRKY transcription factor family is ubiquitously present in the green plant lineage. Most algae contain one or a few WRKY proteins, whereas even the earliest land plant, moss (Physcomitrella patens), possesses at least 30 WRKY factors. Most vascular plants contain in excess of 50 WRKY transcription factors. Outside of plant WRKY proteins have been identified in Giardia lamblia and Dictyostelium discoideum. However, little is known about the function of these proteins. Of these two WRKY proteins, WRKY1 of Giardia has been demonstrated to be involved in cell wall formation,Pan, Cho, Kao and Sun (2009) A Novel WRKY-like Protein Involved in Transcriptional Activation of Cyst Wall Protein Genes in Giardia lamblia. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 284(27). 17975-17988 a process also likely important to algae and early land plants. WRKYs have recently been found in the white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus.Kamal, Singh, Upadhyay, Sharma, Gupta, et al. (2014) Identification of the WRKY Transcription Factors in Agaricus bisporus (White Button Mushroom). Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Mushroom Biology and Mushroom Products. It remains unclear how and why the WRKY proteins dramatically expanded and diversified in the plant lineage but not algae. Several early reports proposed that a group I WRKY transcription factor was the progenitor of the family.Wu, Guo, Wang and Li (2005) The WRKY Family of Transcription Factors in Rice and Arabidopsis and Their Origins. DNA Research. 12(1). 9-26, Zhang and Wang (2005) The WRKY transcription factor superfamily: its origin in eukaryotes and expansion in plants. BMC Evolutionary Biology. 5(1). 1 It was thought that a single group I WRKY domain occurred first and then duplicated to form the original ancestral WRKY transcription factor. However, more recent evidence suggests that WRKY transcription factors evolved from a single group IIc-like gene, which then diversified into group I, group IIc, and group IIa+b domains.Brand, Fischer, Harter, Kohlbacher and Wanke (2013) Elucidating the evolutionary conserved DNA-binding specificities of WRKY transcription factors by molecular dynamics and in vitro binding assays. Nucleic Acids Research. 41(21). 9764-9778 The original WRKY protein domain has been proposed to have arisen from the GCM1 and FLYWCH zinc finger factors.Babu, Iyer, Balaji and Aravind (2006) The natural history of the WRKY‚ÄìGCM1 zinc fingers and the relationship between transcription factors and transposons.

Nucleic Acids Research. 34(22). 6505-6520 Both GCM1 and FLYWCH belong to families of DNA-binding factors found in metazoan. The plant specific NAC transcription factor family also shares a common structural shape and origin with WRKY transcription factors.Welner, Lindemose, Grossmann, M√∏llegaard, Olsen, et al.

Biochemical Journal. 444(3). 395-404 During plant evolution the WRKY family has dramatically expanded, which is proposed to be a result of through duplication.Wu, Guo, Wang and Li (2005) The WRKY Family of Transcription Factors in Rice and Arabidopsis and Their Origins. DNA Research. 12(1). 9-26 Some species including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) have WRKY groups which dramatically expanded and diversified in recent evolutionary history.Wu, Guo, Wang and Li (2005) The WRKY Family of Transcription Factors in Rice and Arabidopsis and Their Origins.

Nucleic Acids Research. 34(22). 6505-6520 Such a model is plausible as WRKY family members are part of numerous phytohormone, developmental, and defense signaling transcriptional networks.

Phylogenetic tree of WRKY transcription factors from the plant kingdom and beyond. WRKY transcription factor genes are found throughout the plant lineage and also outside of the plant lineage in some diplomonads, social amoebae, fungi incertae sedis, and amoebozoa.Charles I. Rinerson, Roel C. Rabara, Prateek Tripathi Qingxi J Shen, and Paul J. Rushton (2015) Structure and evolution of WRKY transcription factors. In Plant Transcription Factors: Evolutionary, Structural and Functional Aspects Edited by: Daniel H. Gonzalez. Elsevier This patchy distribution suggests that lateral gene transfer is responsible. These lateral gene transfer events appear to pre-date the formation of the WRKY groups in flowering plants, where there are seven well-defined groups, Groups I + IIc, Groups IIa + IIb, Groups IId + IIe, and Group III. Flowering plants also contain proteins with domains typical for both resistance (R) proteins and WRKY transcription factors. R protein-WRKY genes have evolved numerous times in flowering plants, each type being restricted to specific flowering plant lineages. These chimeric proteins contain not only novel combinations of protein domains but also novel combinations and numbers of WRKY domains. Function Over the last two decades great effort has been invested in characterizing WRKY transcription factors. The results show that WRKY transcription factors function in a diverse array of plant response, both to internal and external cues. =Plant Development= Studies have demonstrated the function of WRKY transcription factors in plant development. Successful male gametogenesis and tolerance to interploidy crosses both require WRKY transcription factors.Guan, Meng, Khanna, Lamontagne, Liu, et al.

Phytochemistry. 102(0). 89-96 Mode of action A long-standing question of in the field of transcriptional regulation is how large families of regulators binding a consensus DNA sequences dictate expression of different target genes. The WRKY transcription factor family has long exemplified this problem. Plant species contain numerous WRKY transcription factors which predominantly recognize a conserved cis-element. Only recently has it begun to be revealed how different WRKY transcription factors regulate unique sets of target genes. =Variation in Cis-element Recognition= Early work indicated that the WRKY family could bind W-box (T/A)TGAC(T/A).Ishiguro and Nakamura (1994) Characterization of a cDNA encoding a novel DNA-binding protein, SPF1, that recognizes SP8 sequences in the 5‚Ä≤ upstream regions of genes coding for sporamin and Œ≤-amylase from sweet potato.

Plant Molecular Biology. 29(4). 691-702 Later, a barley (Hordeum vulgare) WRKY transcription factor, SUSIBA2, was found to bind the Sugar Response Element (TAAAGATTACTAATAGGAA), illustrating some diversity exists in DNA sequence which WRKYs could recognize.Sun, Palmqvist, Olsson, Bor√©n, Ahlandsberg, et al. (2003) A Novel WRKY Transcription Factor, SUSIBA2, Participates in Sugar Signaling in Barley by Binding to the Sugar-Responsive Elements of the iso1 Promoter. The Plant Cell Online. 15(9). 2076-2092 Since then, WRKYs have been found to bind a more generic GAC core cis-element with flanking sequences dictating DNA-protein interactions.Brand, Fischer, Harter, Kohlbacher and Wanke (2013) Elucidating the evolutionary conserved DNA-binding specificities of WRKY transcription factors by molecular dynamics and in vitro binding assays.

Nucleic Acids Research. 41(21). 9764-9778 Additionally, contrary to early reports, both WRKY domains of group I family members can bind DNA.Brand, Fischer, Harter, Kohlbacher and Wanke (2013) Elucidating the evolutionary conserved DNA-binding specificities of WRKY transcription factors by molecular dynamics and in vitro binding assays. Nucleic Acids Research. 41(21). 9764-9778 Implications of these results are still being resolved. =Protein-Protein Interactions= One mechanism for determining WRKY binding activity is by protein-protein interactions. WRKY transcription factors have been found to interact with a variety of proteins, some of which occur by a group specific manner. Recent evidence suggests that VQ protein family is an important regulator of group I and group IIc WRKY transcription factors.Cheng, Zhou, Yang, Chi, Zhou, et al. (2012) Structural and Functional Analysis of VQ Motif-Containing Proteins in Arabidopsis as Interacting Proteins of WRKY Transcription Factors. Plant Physiology. 159(2). 810-825 VQ proteins appear to bind the WRKY domain, thus inhibiting protein-DNA interactions. At least one WRKY transcription factor, Arabidopsis WRKY57, interacts with jasmonate ZIM- domain (JAZ) and auxin/indole acetic acid (AUX/IAA) repressor of the jasmonate and auxin signaling cascade, respectively, indicating a point of crosstalk between these phytohormones.Jiang, Liang, Yang and Yu (2014) Arabidopsis WRKY57 Functions as a Node of Convergence for Jasmonic Acid‚Äì and Auxin- Mediated Signaling in Jasmonic Acid‚ÄìInduced Leaf Senescence.

FEBS Letters. 579(6). 1545-1550 =Phosphorylation= Protein phosphorylation is a common method to regulate protein activity and WRKY transcription factors are no exception.

The Plant Cell. 23(4). 1639-1653 are regulated by phosphorylation via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Additionally, a MAPK can phosphorylate a VQ protein, freeing the WRKY transcription factor for target gene activation.Qiu, Fiil, Petersen, Nielsen, Botanga, et al. (2008) Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 regulates gene expression through transcription factor release in the nucleus. EMBO J. 27(16). 2214-2221 While kinases phosphorylating WRKY transcription factors are known, phosphatases removing phosphate groups have yet to be identified. =Proteasomeal Degradation= Protein degradation via the proteasome is a common feature in plant regulatory networks to limit the duration of activation or repression by transcription factors. WRKY transcription factors have also been found to be regulated by proteasomal degradation mechanisms. In Chinese grapevine (Vitis pseudoreticulata) ERYSIPHE NECATOR-INDUCED RING FINGER PROTEIN1 targets WRKY11 for degradation leading to enhanced powdery mildew resistance.Yu, Xu, Wang, Wang, Yao, et al.

It was formed in Australia in late 1944 as No. 300 Wing with the role of providing air transport for the British Pacific Fleet (BPF), and was redesignated as a group in 1945. It transported BPF supplies and personnel around Australia and to the fleet's forward bases in the Philippines and Manus Island. The group was disbanded in April 1946. History No. 300 Wing RAF was established at Mascot Airport in Sydney in late 1944 to provide the British Pacific Fleet with a means of rapidly transporting personnel, essential supplies and mail. The wing (and later group) came under the control of the commander of the BPF, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, and was the only RAF unit to be directly assigned to a Royal Navy fleet commander during World War II. In February 1945 No. 300 Wing comprised two flying units: No. 243 Squadron equipped with 30 Douglas Dakotas and No. 1315 Flight with 6 Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Two of the Liberators were fitted as VIP transports, and were used by Fraser and other senior officers. Many of No. 243 Squadron's personnel were Australians. While the wing's main base was at Camden Airport to the west of Sydney, its headquarters was located in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra to liaise with the headquarters of the Royal Australian Air Force. During early 1945 the wing established a regular service from Sydney to the BPF's forward base at Manus Island off the north coast of New Guinea; by March these flights operated daily. Regular services to the BPF's logistical hub at Leyte Gulf in the Philippines began in April 1945, and a route to Enewetak Atoll (a key base for BPF tankers) was added in July that year. Thrice-weekly services were also flown to San Diego in the United States, and a regular route was established to Colombo in Ceylon. Parties of servicing personnel were established at each of these destinations and several staging points in Australia and New Guinea. During 1945, as additional personnel and aircraft arrived in Australia, No. 300 Wing was redesignated No. 300 Group. In June that year it was joined by No. 238 Squadron, which took the number of Dakotas in the group to 70. This squadron was based at Parafield Airport in Adelaide. Two of No. 300 Group's Dakotas crashed into the ocean during the war, resulting in the deaths of both crews. Following the end of the war, No. 300 Group extended its regular route from Sydney to the Philippines to Hong Kong, and was reinforced by a third flying squadron. The group subsequently opened routes to Singapore as well as Balikpapan and Labuan in Borneo, and Saigon in French Indochina. No. 238 and No. 243 Squadrons were disbanded in Australia on 27 December 1945 and 15 April 1946 respectively. Between its arrival in Australia and disbandment, No. 238 Squadron's aircraft were reported to have flown a total of 2.3 million miles and transported thousands of service personnel monthly without suffering any serious accidents. No. 300 Group was disbanded in April 1946; some of its aircraft were subsequently transferred to Hong Kong and Singapore.

Early life and education Rosamond Davenport Hill was born on 4 August 1825 in Chelsea in London. Her parents were Matthew Davenport Hill and Margaret Bucknall. In 1826, the family moved to Chancery Lane then in 1831, they moved to Hampstead Heath. The children were Alfred Hill born in 1821, Florence Davenport Hill who was also born in Chelsea in 1828, Matthew Berkeley Hill and Joanna Margaret Hill who was born in Hampstead in 1836/7.Deborah Sara Gorham, 'Hill, Rosamond Davenport (1825‚Äì1902)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 accessed 27 Jan 2015 Rosamond's immediate family were all reforming individuals but her extended family on her father's side included the stamp inventor Rowland Hill, the prison inspector Frederic Hill and Francis Hill. As a young girl, Davenport Hill was fond of botany, which she studied at a day school. She received a lot of her education at home, which was taught by her mother, who suffered from health problems and relied on Davenport Hill to help maintain the home. Davenport Hill was a very proactive child regarding her own education. As part of her schooling, she and her sister Florence interviewed the Irish writer Maria Edgeworth on 1 March 1840. That year, the family moved to Haverstock Hill. Upon their move, they became friendly with William Makepeace Thackeray. Teaching career and prison reform interests In 1841, the family moved to France, followed by Belgium in 1844, and eventually Switzerland and Italy. The family moved back to England, settling in Bristol, in 1851 due to Matthew Davenport Hill becoming a bankruptcy commissioner. Davenport Hill began working for Mary Carpenter. She worked at Carpenter's St. James ragged school and taught the children arithmetic and home economics. She also worked for her father, who had become active in educational and criminal law reform. She visited Ireland in 1856, where she visited prisons with her father. She wrote a book about her experience titled \\"A Lady's Visit to the Irish Convict Prisons\\". In 1858, the two went to Spain, France, and Germany to visit prisons. Davenport Hill focused exclusively about prison reform until the mid-1870s. She co-authored a book with her father, in 1860, titled \\"Our Exemplars, Rich and Poor.\\" In 1855, Davenport Hill visited Mettray Penal Colony with her father. They became close friends with Mettray's founder, Fr√©d√©ric-Auguste Demetz. Mettray suffered considerable damage during the Franco-Prussian War. Davenport Hill raised ¬£2,500 to fund renovations for Mettray. Inspired by the work there, Davenport Hill, and her sister, opened an industrial school for girls based on Mettray, in Bristol. Her father died in 1872. Upon her father's death, Davenport Hill travelled to Adelaide in South Australia, to visit family including her reforming cousin Emily Clark. She travelled with her sister Florence and the two of them were to stay together for life. While in Australia, the sisters did inspections of schools, prisons and reformatories. Henry Parkes served as one of their guides. Davenport Hill spoke before a commission in Sydney about the reformatory movement. She wrote a paper, titled \\"A Summary of the Principles of Reformatory Treatment, with a Special Reference to Girls' (printed in the Memoir)\\" that argued that reform treatment should emphasise independence and self-efficacy. The two sisters travelled from Australia to Egypt and Italy, returning home in 1875. During their travels, they wrote and published \\"What we saw in Australia\\". In 1878, they published a biography about their father. The two sisters lived in Hampstead. Davenport Hill left the Church of England and became a Unitarian Universalist. Education career On 5 December 1879, Davenport Hill was elected a Progressive Party member of the school board for the City of London. She served until 1897. She sat on the industrial school committee and the school management committee. She chaired the management of Greystoke Place. She became chairman of the cooking committee and published multiple papers on the subject in education. She was an early opposer of the school board's pension program for teachers, which was eventually abolished in 1895. She visited the United States and Canada, travelling to schools across the countries in 1888. This inspired her to introduce pianos to schools for the sake of marching and drill. She also became interested in sloyd education. She opposed the board's interest in providing meals to children and also protested the religious stances of the board, despite supporting daily religious teachings. Davenport HIll was a member of the National Froebel Foundation. She served on the board of the University College London. Retirement and later life She retired from the board in 1897. She moved in with her sister in a home called Hillstow in Oxford. Upon her retirement, the Brentwood Industrial School was renamed the Davenport-Hill Home for Boys. Davenport Hill died at Hillstow on 6 August 1902.

It derives its name from the fact that the flowers rattle if gently shaken. Description Lyperanthus serratus is a tuberous, perennial herb, high with 3 to 10 green, yellow and brown flowers, wide, from September to October. The flowers have white (non-secreting) glandular hairs on the labellum. There is a single leaf which is arched, ribbed, leathery and linear, about long and wide. A powdery bloom covers the entire plant, except for the innermost parts of the flower. The single leaf is lance-shaped, long and wide, dark green with a paler lower surface. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described by John Lindley in 1840 in his The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. The type specimen was collected by Drummond near the Swan River. Lindley noted \\"This has, when dried, so much the appearance of L. suaveolens, that I mistook it for that species. It is however a much stouter plant; and, as will be seen by the above character, the labellum is altogether different.\\" The specific epithet (serratus) alludes to \\"The prominent white calli found on the labellum [which] are also distinctive and lead to the scientific name 'serratus' meaning prominent teeth.\\" Distribution and habitat The species occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographical regions of Western Australia on sand, loam or sandy clay. It grows in a variety of habitats including forest, woodland and heath and often grows through reasonably low, dense vegetation. Uses =Horticulture= As with other Australian terrestrial orchids, Lyperanthus serratus is not well known in cultivation but success has been achieved with the closely related Lyperanthus suaveolens.

Its role at various times has included the publication of hotel directories, market research, support of standardization efforts, public or political advocacy for the interests of hotel owners and the establishment or promotion of training programs and facilities for hotel personnel.  History  The American Hotel Protective Association, founded in 1910 as a regional trade association in Chicago, became the American Hotel Association in 1917. The AHA's first president, Frank Dudley, identified rapid expansion of the US hotel industry as vulnerable to a shortage of trained personnel which could not be filled by the then-common practice of recruiting European hotel workers. With the backing of Ellsworth Milton Statler and of the Federal Board of Vocational Training, the group promoted college-level training in hotel management and the creation of the Cornell Hotel School at Cornell University under dean Howard Meek. H√¥teliers thrived during the Roaring Twenties; in 1928, the AHA Red Book listed 25,900 hotels with 1,525,000 rooms distributed widely across the US, with fewer hotels in the ex-Confederate South because racial segregation excluded many travellers, including African Americans. (These segregated travellers used the Negro Motorist Green Book to find accommodations.) Properties were forced to adapt to the newfound popularity of the motorcar, adding parking and establishing locations on main highways; the number of rooms in each newly constructed hotel was increasing. Prohibition hurt the hotel trade by cutting into revenue from food and beverage operations, but the Great Depression would prove disastrous for business. Overexpansion during the 1920s left excess inventory in the Depression era. The 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, which sought to employ nationwide trade organisations to regulate wages and prices to halt a deflationary spiral, drew strong opposition from hotel owners (who saw it as a prelude to unionisation) and from the association. Fewer people were travelling overall and hotels were losing market share to less expensive \\"tourist courts\\", a new pattern of small clusters of hastily constructed cabins which were the predecessors of the early roadside motels. Two out of three US hotels went into receivership. Initial attempts to include \\"tourist courts\\" in AHA's scope were doomed as the interests of the motel owners were in direct conflict with the existing hotels whose rates were being undercut by the new entrants. Various motel-specific groups, such as the American Motor Hotel Association, filled this gap. The motels were ultimately included in 1962 with AHA becoming AHMA, the American Hotel and Motel Association. The American Hotel and Lodging Association now is significantly involved in lobbying on behalf of the hotel industry's goals. Agenda In 1952, the AHA approached Mississippi State University to operate an extension training curriculum, the American Hotel Institute. The association also proposed that members standardise various tasks within each hotel operation, from accounting to training and customer service, as a means to improve operational efficiency. As early as 1928, it worked with supplier groups to advocate standardisation for tableware and porcelain china throughout the hotel. The group's stance on tipping in hotels has varied from careful neutrality in the pre-WW1 era (when unions were protesting that owners should pay their staff a fair wage instead of shifting the burden to the client) to advocating clients provide generous gratuities to a long list of personnel in its 2013 Gratuity Guide. In response to complaints of overcharging for calls from in-room telephones, the association has supported the FCC's protection of a travellers' right to select which carrier provides operator services. The group does not make any recommendation for standard procedure to deal with bed bugs. AHA has supported market research to gauge user demand for specific amenities, such as fitness centres, in tourist hotels. The organisation hosts various committees, conventions and workshops. The American Hotel Association Directory Corporation, a subsidiary, published Lodging magazine and the Directory of Hotel and Motel Companies. The American Hotel and Lodging Association has been one of the leading advocates of resort fees. Resort fees are extra mandatory fees that are not included in the advertised hotel price. A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report from January 2017 said that resort fees are likely to harm consumers. In addition to advocating for resort fees, the AHLA has entered the advocacy work against short term home sharing. The AHLA has been doubled their political action committee (PAC) budget over two years (from 2014 to 2016). Many of the politicians who have received significant contributions from the American Hotel and Lodging Association PAC advocate for resort fees and against home sharing.

As an adult, she continued to perform in many of the major London theatres and on tour. For a time, she managed the City of London Theatre. Her adult career lasted only a decade, as she died at the age of 26. Life and career Honey was born out of wedlock to a singer and actress, Anne Bell (died 1861). Her mother married John Young in 1823. The two produced John William Young (born 1831) and Fanny Young, an actress (1834‚Äì1860). Honey's mother performed at Sadler's Wells in the 1820s, where Honey helped with wardrobe and played in juvenile roles under the name Laura Bell. Her mother began working at the Olympic Theatre in 1826, and Honey joined her mother there. Honey performed in Bayle Bernard's play \\"Casco Bay\\" in 1827. Honey then moved to the Surrey Theatre and took music lessons. She returned to Sadler's Wells in 1929. In 1831, she married William Honey. The two had a daughter (Laura Dalton Honey, 1834‚Äì1884), but he took advantage of her finances, and they divorced. William drowned in 1836 in a boating accident on the Thames River. She later married Ernest Gaston, who wrote songs, and the two had another child (Ada, born c. 1839), but she continued to perform as Laura Honey. Honey performed at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1832 in Loves of the Angels by Leman Rede. The following year, she performed at the Queen's Theatre and Prince of Wales Theatre. Next, she performed at the Adelphi Theatre. She performed as Psyche in a burlesque called \\"Cupid\\" opposite John Reeve. After a season at the Haymarket Theatre she toured in Britain. Other West End theatres where she played included the St James's and the Olympic, before she took over the management of the City of London Theatre. She played Tom Tug in The Waterman, Myrtilla in Planch√©'s adaptation of \\"Riquet with the Tuft\\" and also performed in Spirit of the Rhine by Morris Barnett, in which she popularised \\"My Beautiful Rhine\\".

It was published in the United Kingdom as The Answers. It is based on the denazification questionnaire which all Germans with some form of responsibility were forced to take by the military government after World War II. Salomon's detailed answers about his political background, membership of various organisations and so on become a portrayal of Germany during the interwar period, World War II and the immediate post-war period. The book became a phenomenon in Germany and sold in large numbers. It was a reference point in the public discourse for years and has continued to be in print. Plot Salomon answers questions and recounts his time as a cadet in the Weimar Republic and in the Freikorps. He writes about battles in the Baltic states and about his involvement in the assassination of foreign minister Walther Rathenau. Salomon shares his experiences from France in the 1930s, from the German film industry during the NS era, the end of the war which he spent in Bavaria with his Jewish girlfriend, and how he after the surrender was tortured in an American prison camp. Publication The book was published by Rowohlt Verlag in 1951. It quickly became popular in Germany and reached six-digit sales numbers within a few years. It has continuously been reprinted in new editions. An English translation by Constantine Fitzgibbon, The Answers, was published in 1954. The American edition is known as The Questionnaire and the British as The Answers. Reception Frederic Morton of The Saturday Review wrote about the English-language publication: \\"The publishers' praise on the dust jacket consists mostly of apology; the 'quotes' used attack rather than support the book; the translation, though technically competent and idiomatically accomplished, somehow smothers the brutal elegance of the German original, making it seem like a war documentary done in rainbow technicolor and set to fairytale music.\\" Morton continued: \\"Yet the book retains its pathogenic significance. ... What distinguishes these retorts is a candor not only unflinching but, one surmises occasionally, not unembellished. Herr von Salomon brandishes his honesty-about-the-past with a braggadoccio piousness.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"A big, sprawling book for the close follower of contemporary history, particularly German, rather than the average reader, this has many flashes of impudence, a sharp wit and a quick sleight of hand to enliven its serious accounting.\\" References External links * The Questionnaire at the publisher's website Category:1951 German novels Category:German autobiographical novels Category:20th-century German novels Category:German-language novels Category:Novels about Nazi Germany Category:Novels by Ernst von Salomon Category:Novels set in France Category:Novels set in the 1920s Category:Novels set in the 1930s Category:Novels set in the 1940s ","title":"The Questionnaire (von Salomon novel)"},{"id":"45216047","text":"The Questionnaire may refer to: * The Questionnaire (novel by Salomon), a 1951 novel by the German writer Ernst von Salomon * The Questionnaire (novel by Gru≈°a), a 1978 novel by the Czech writer Ji≈ô√≠ Gru≈°a See also * Questionnaire * Questionnaire (horse) ","title":"The Questionnaire"},{"id":"45216156","text":"Patrol Squadron 30 (VP-30) is a maritime patrol squadron of the United States Navy, established on 30 June 1960.

The squadron was organized to be a replacement Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) squadron, providing a continuous flow of operationally qualified pilots, aircrew and maintenance personnel to fleet patrol squadrons. Detachment Alpha was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, to train personnel on the P5M Marlin seaplane, while the NAS Jacksonville unit provided training in the land-based P2V Neptune. The squadron had an initial complement of 40 officers, 271 enlisted personnel, five P5M-2S seaplanes and thirteen P2V aircraft (seven P2V-5FS and six P2V-7S). On 15 July 1961, the Alpha detachment was merged with the parent organization at NAS Jacksonville when plans were made to begin retiring the P5M Marlin from the Navy‚Äôs active inventory. On June 1, 1962, Detachment Alpha was reestablished at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, to begin replacement training in the new P-3A Orion aircraft. The unit expanded until the end of the year, by which time it was staffed with 10 officers and 53 enlisted personnel. On 21 October 1962, VP-30 transitioned from replacement training to an operational status for participation in the naval quarantine of Cuba, providing ASW cover for Task Force 44. The squadron reverted to its primary training mission in March 1963. On 10 January 1966, the NAS Patuxent River detachment became the parent command, with the squadron headquarters relocating from NAS Jacksonville to NAS Patuxent River. Detachment Alpha was relocated to NAS Jacksonville for replacement training in the SP-2E Neptune aircraft. From 27 May to June 4, 1968, VP-30 was called upon to assist in the search for the missing nuclear-powered attack submarine , overdue since 22 May 1968. The squadron searched the last known location of the vessel, east of Norfolk, until 4 June 1968, without result. On 10 December 1968, VP-30‚Äôs Alpha detachment at NAS Jacksonville was phased out with the retirement of the SP-2E airframe from the Navy‚Äôs inventory while the later SP-2H variant remained in the active duty Navy until 1970 and the Naval Reserve until 1978. The assets and personnel of the detachment were merged with VP-31‚Äôs Detachment A, home based at NAS North Island, San Diego, California and personnel staffing of the former VP-30 Detachment A was reduced from 400 to 300 with the merger. The expanded VP-31 Det A continued training on the P-3 Orion airframe. In June 1969, VP-30 received the first computerized models of the P-3C, later known as \\"Baseline\\" or \\"Non-Update\\" models. In 1970, with the advent of the Fleet Readiness Aviation Maintenance Training Program (FRAMP), VP-30 began training maintenance personnel as well as flight crew personnel, conducting ten classes a year. On 22 March 1972 Lieutenant, junior grade Judith Neuffer, the second female Naval Aviator, reported aboard VP-30. She became the first female aviator to receive training in the P-3. Upon graduation, she reported to Airborne Early Warning Squadron FOUR (VW-4), the \\"Navy Hurricane Hunters\\" at NAS Jacksonville, flying the WP-3A. On June 21, 1972, VP-30 became the first squadron operating the P-3 to reach the safety milestone of 100,000 consecutive accident-free flight hours. On September 6, 1972, AXAN Colleen A. Ocha became the first woman to undergo maintenance training at VP-30 in the Fleet Replacement Aviation Maintenance Program (FRAMP). On 30 July 1975, VP-30 was relocated from NAS Patuxent River to its former home base at NAS Jacksonville. The Navy was prompted to initiate the move in the mid-1970s due to the increasing suburban construction around the Patuxent River airfield, electronic interference from Naval Air Test Center operations and the danger of an air crash in a residential area. By 1983, VP-30 had grown to a staff of 700 personnel of all ranks, with 24 aircraft for the training of aircrew and maintenance people for service with Atlantic Fleet operational patrol squadrons in the P-3C, P-3C Update II and P-3C Update II.5 aircraft. In 1988, the squadron also commenced training on the P-3C Update III. In October 1993, VP-30 became the sole Navy P-3 fleet readiness squadron upon the disestablishment of VP-31 following the BRAC-directed closure of NAS Moffett Field, California. In July 1995, VP-30 surpassed 31 years and 300,000 flight hours of accident-free flying, a Naval Aviation record. In 1998, VP-30 formed the P-3 Weapons Tactics Unit (P-3 WTU) to provide fleet-wide training on topics including advanced tactics, weapon system employment, and in an effort to improve survivability during overland missions, established counter threat training. As a result, full operational integration of this platform was achieved during operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, where Aircraft Improvement Program (AIP)-equipped P-3Cs fired AGM-88 Harpoon and AGM-88 SLAM- ER missiles, the first time the P-3 had fired missiles in combat since the Vietnam War. In 2002, VP-30 graduated the first Fleet Air Reconnaissance squadron (VQ) Naval Flight Officers after assuming the duties as EP-3E Sensor System Improvement Program model manager. In 2003, the squadron instituted the Fleet Instructor Training Course and the squadron's Naval Air Training and Operational Procedure Standardization (NATOPS) Department integrated the Naval Portable Flight Planning System into the P-3C and EP-3E fleet for training and evaluation. With the consolidation of VP-30 and VP-31 into a single-site FRS in 1993, VP-30 is now the largest aviation squadron in the U.S. Navy and is considered an \\"aviation major command,\\" with a commanding officer in the rank of Captain who has held previous command of an operational fleet P-3 or P-8 squadron. There are currently twelve active duty VP fleet squadrons flying the P-3C and P-8A, an active duty unmanned patrol fleet squadron (VUP) flying the MQ-4C and two Naval Air Force Reserve VP fleet squadrons flying the P-3C homeported at NAS Jacksonville under Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing ELEVEN (CPRW-11) and NAS Whidbey Island, Washington under Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing TEN (CPRW-10). In addition, one active duty special project squadron (VPU) flying modified P-3C aircraft is homeported at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and one Fleet Air Reconnaissance squadron (VQ) flying the EP-3E Aries II is homeported at NAS Whidbey Island, both units under the control of CPRW-10. In addition, a Navy Reserve Squadron Augment Unit (SAU), similar to U.S. Air Force's \\"Associate\\" wing construct in the Air Force Reserve, was established at VP-30 to aid in the responsibilities of supporting both Active Component and Reserve Component units as part of Active Reserve Integration (ARI). All of these operational squadrons are by VP-30. Awards VP-30‚Äôs awards include six Navy Meritorious Unit Commendations, including three for the training and introduction of P-3s for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, for P-3C Update II training of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force and the Royal Netherlands Navy, and for the consolidation of all P-3 training into a single-site FRS. VP-30 also received the United States Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device for participation in the 1985‚Äì1986 Winter Law Enforcement Operation; the 1971, 1983, 1991, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2007 and 2008 CNO Safety Award, and the 1995, 1999, 2000, and 2001 CINCLANTFLT Golden Anchor Award for retention. VP-30 was honored to receive the 2008 Golden Wrench Award as well as the 2010 DEFY Fulcrum Shield award and 2010 Retention Excellence award. In December 2010, VP-30 surpassed 46 years and over 450,000 flight hours without a Class A mishap. Additionally, the 2010 Naval Safety Center Aviation Maintenance Survey assessed VP-30 as having the best overall score of more than 300 units evaluated over the previous year. VP-30 has twice received the Commander T.G. Ellyson Award for aviator production excellence, which is presented to the Navy's most effective fleet replacement squadron.

The Renault Kadjar was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, with sales starting in April 2015 in Europe, and in 2016 in China. Overview Renault Kadjar Dynamique The Kadjar shares the same Renault‚ÄìNissan Common Module Family platform as the Nissan Qashqai, which will allow for front and four wheel drive. It is offered with the latest version of Renault's R Link 2 infotainment system (voice control, navigation, Bluetooth and radio), engine stop start, emergency brake assist, lane departure warning and traffic sign recognition with speed limit alerts, 360 degree sensors, reversing camera, and a hands free parking system. The 108 bhp 1.5 litre diesel is the most economical model offered, with CO2 emissions of 99g/km and fuel economy of 74.3mpg. Final performance figures are not yet confirmed, but offers much the same levels as the Qashqai, with 0‚Äì62 mph (100 km/h) coming in 11.9 seconds. The 128 bhp 1.6 litre diesel makes it from 0‚Äì62 mph (100 km/h) in 9.9 seconds, emit 115g/km and average 64mpg. Performance and economy figures are said to be largely similar for both automatic and manual versions. The 4WD version has slightly higher emissions. A 128 bhp 1.2 TCe petrol model is also offered. Renault claims the Kadjar name is based on two words: Kad is inspired by quad to represent a go anywhere four wheeled vehicle, and Jar recalls the French words agile and jaillir respectively representing agility and suddenly emerging from somewhere. Renault published a more elaborate explanation of the name Kadjar in the blog section of their corporate web site. However, its relation to Qashqai points to its relation to the Qajars or in French Kadjars. Since Nasser ed-Din Shah the Qajar shahs of Persia wrote their name in western script in the French way: Kadjar. This relation has been noted in several professional and social media in prevalently neutral, but in few cases, a bit enthusiastic manner. There were also rare bursts of politically based outrage. According to two Iranian sources, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar King of Iran (1853‚Äì1907), acquired two Renault cars in Belgium in 1900 while on his trip in Europe, and had them delivered to Iran. These were to be the first automobiles in Iran. The car received a facelift in 2018, with production of the remodeled car starting some time the following year. With four new engines to replace the old, a change to the exterior design and an updated interior with more space for items, updated infotainment system and some small changes to the climate control.

Valabhi was the capital of the Maitraka empire during the period 480-775 CE. It was an important port for international trade located in Saurashtra, present day it is called Vallabhipur located in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat in western India, identical with the old state of Vala. For some time, the university was considered to be a rival to Nalanda, in Bihar, in the field of education. In September 2017, the Indian central government started to consider a proposal to revive the ancient university.Prashant Ruperal: Ancient Vallabhi University to be revived, The Times of India, September 24, 2017, accessed on September 25, 2017.  Curriculum  Though Valabhi is known to have championed the cause of Hinayana Buddhism, it was neither exclusive nor insular. Brahmanical sciences were also taught here along with the doctrines of Buddhism. References have been found to Brahmanic students who came to learn at this university from the Gangetic plains. Apart from religious sciences, courses offered include: # Nƒ´ti (Political Science, Statesmanship) # VƒÅrtƒÅ (Business, Agriculture) # Administration # Theology # Law # Economics and Accountancy Students graduating from Valabhi were usually employed by kings to assist in the government of their kingdoms.  Fame and influence  The prominence of Valabhi was known over the whole of Northern India. Kathasaritsagara narrates the story of a Brahmana, who was determined that he would rather send his son to Valabhi, than to Nalanda or Banaras. Gunamati and Sthiramati were two of its Panditas; very little is known about the other famous teachers and scholars who lived here. It is quite certain that a stamp of approval of doctrines preached by various scholars by the Panditas of Valabhi, who were of authority, was valued highly in learned assemblies of many kingdoms. Valabhi was visited by Xuanzang, a Chinese pilgrim, in the 7th century and by Yijing towards the end of the century. Yijing described the university as at par with the Buddhist monastic center Nalanda.  Administration and finance  When Xuanzang visited the university in the middle of the 7th century, there were more than 6000 monks studying in the place. Some 100 monasteries were provided for their accommodation. The citizens of Valabhi, many of whom were rich and generous, made available the funds necessary for running the institution. The Maitraka kings, who ruled over the country, acted as patrons to the university. They provided enormous grants for the working of the institution and equipping its libraries.  Decline and end  In 775 CE, the patron kings succumbed to an attack by the Arabs. This gave the university a temporary set- back. Even afterwards, the work of the university continued incessantly, as the successors of the Maitraka dynasty continued to patronize it with bountiful donations. Not much information has been retrieved regarding the university during and after this period. The defeat of its patron kings had definitely led way to the slow death of all its educational activities in the 12th century. References * Apte, D.

Alpha Sigma Rho Sorority is a non-profit, Greek-lettered sorority committed to service projects with a primary focus geared towards helping those in the Asian-American community. The sorority was founded on April 2, 1998, at the University of Georgia at Athens (UGA) by twelve founding mothers. Alpha Sigma Rho was the first Asian-interest sorority established in the state of Georgia. Alpha Sigma Rho is based on the principles of academic excellence, interpersonal growth, moral development, and strength in unity.  History  The twelve founding mothers were Irene Chien, Sandra Chu, Young Jeon, Debbie Kwon, Angela Lu, Lynn Nguyen, Anne See, Anna Suh, Juliette Taylor, Jessica Yoo, Suzanne Yoo, and Jasmine Yu. These women came together in the fall semester of 1997 upon realizing the need for Asian unity and a stronger voice within the campus and surrounding community. The Alpha Sigma Rho founders felt that their unique goals and ideals were not well-represented within the existing sororities on UGA's campus. These ladies believed that a sorority should exist primarily to breach the barriers between separate cultural backgrounds, thereby promoting a sisterhood based on mutual respect and appreciation.  Philanthropy  Since its founding in 1998, Alpha Sigma Rho's National Philanthropy has been fighting against cancer and raising awareness. In 2011, Alpha Sigma Rho decided to solely focus their contributions on Ovarian Cancer Research by supporting the National Ovarian Cancer Center (NOCC). September is National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, and in honor of this month, all Alpha Sigma Rho chapters and colonies host Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, in which sisters come together for fundraising, and to promote and educate the community about ovarian cancer. Every Alpha Sigma Rho Chapter or Colony also has a local philanthropy in which they contribute funds and raise awareness for their chosen organization year round. Some of the local philanthropies include 'China Care, Austin Children's Services formerly known as Austin Children's Shelter, and Circle of Sisterhood.  Membership  Alpha Sigma Rho is an Asian-interest organization composed of college-educated women. Although Alpha Sigma Rho is an Asian-interest sorority, diversity is welcomed and shown among our members. Women may seek membership during undergraduate years of study through established chapters or colonies. Membership is open to anyone who meets Alpha Sigma Rho requirements, regardless of race, nationality, or religion. Since its founding, Alpha Sigma Rho has expanded across States and has presence in Texas, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, and South Carolina. Today, as it continues to grow, Alpha Sigma Rho still remembers the beliefs that the organization was founded upon and continues to promote sisterhood, cultural diversity and Asian-interest. Above all else, sisters are taught the importance of strength in unity.

As per Bangla Trek,Bangla Trek it is the second highest peak of the country; though it is not officially recognized by the government. Many local adventurers describe this as one of the wildest peaks of Bangladesh. The peak was first summitted in 2005 by Bangladeshi adventurers Subrata Das Nitish and Bijoy Shankar Kar. The same team repeated the feat in 2007. The altitude could not be measured in these two expeditions as the team was not carrying a GPS device. On January 12, 2012, the peak was summitted for the third time by Bangla Trek team members Tashdid Rezwan Mugdho, Tarikul Alom Sujon, Salehin Arshady and S.M. Mainul. They precisely measured altitude and location. Two of the team members, Mugdho and Sujon died in a bus crash on their return to Bandarban. The other two members, Salehin and Mainul suffered serious injuries. On October 13, 2013, a team led by Shahzaman Chowdhury Hira became the third team to summit the peak.

Especially since the 1990s, CHAT has attracted a growing interest among academics worldwide. Introduction Elsewhere CHAT has been defined as \\"a cross-disciplinary framework for studying how humans purposefully transform natural and social reality, including themselves, as an ongoing culturally and historically situated, materially and socially mediated process\\".CHAT explicitly incorporates the mediation of activities by society, which means that it can be used to link concerns normally independently examined by sociologists of education and (social) psychologists. and Core ideas are: 1) humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions; 2) humans make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate; and 3) community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning ‚Äì and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting.Activity Theory in a Nutshell.

Historical overview =Origins: revolutionary Russia= CHAT traces its lineage to dialectical materialism, classical German philosophy,In particular Goethe's romantic science ideas which were later taken up by Hegel. The meaning of \\"activity\\" in the conceptual sense is rooted in the German word T√§tigkeit. Hegel is considered the first philosopher to point out that the development of humans' knowledge is not spiritually given, but developed in history from living and working in natural environments.Blunden, A. 2012, \\"The Origins of Cultural Historical Activity Theory\\" ; Blunden, A. Genealogy of CHAT (graph). and the work of Lev Vygotsky, Aleksei N. Leontiev and Aleksandr Luria, known as \\"the founding troika\\" of the cultural-historical approach to Social Psychology. In a radical departure from the behaviorism and reflexology that dominated much of psychology in the early 1920s, they formulated, in the spirit of Karl Marx's Theses on Feuerbach, the concept of activity, i.e., \\"artifact-mediated and object-oriented action\\".\\"A human individual never reacts directly (or merely with inborn reflexes) to the environment. Consciousness and conscious action must be the central object of study for psychological science, since it is this that distinguishes humanity. The relationship between human agent and objects of environment is mediated by cultural means, tools and signs. Human action has a tripartite structure.\\"() By bringing together the notion of history and culture in the understanding of human activity, they were able to transcend the Cartesian dualism between subject and object, internal and external, between people and society, between individual inner consciousness and the outer world of society.At the beginning of and into the mid-20th century, Psychology was dominated by schools of thought that ignored real life processes in psychological functioning (e.g. Gestalt psychology, Behaviorism and Cognitivism (psychology)). Lev Vygotsky, who created the foundation of cultural-historical psychology, based on the concept of mediation, published six books on psychology topics during a working life which spanned only ten years. He died of TB in 1934 at the age of 37. A.N. Leont'ev worked with Lev Vygotsky and Alexandr Luria from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of a Marxist psychology. Leontiev left Vygotsky's group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in Kharkov. There he was joined by local psychologists, including Pyotr Galperin and Pyotr Zinchenko.For a history of what came to be known as the Kharkov School of Psychology re: Yasnitsky & Ferrari, 2008 in: History of Psychology Vol. 11, No. 2, 101‚Äì121. He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters.Veer and Valsiner, 1991 Leontiev returned to Moscow in 1934. Contrary to popular belief, Vygotsky's work per se was never banned in StalinistWhen Stalin succeeded Lenin in 1924, the Soviet Union gradually turned into a dictatorship. This led to 30 years of stagnation during which intellectuals and academics who deviated from the Stalinist ideology were politically attacked for their work and eventually eliminated. Vygotsky's colleagues had to flee to Ukraine for safety. Sannino & Sutter, 2011 p. 563. Stalin died in 1953 and restrictions were subsequently gradually relaxed. Soviet Russia. In 1950 A.N.Leontiev became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Philosophy of the Lomonosov Moscow State University (MGU). This department became an independent Faculty in 1966 due mainly to his hard work. He remained there until his death in 1979. Leontiev's formulation of activity theory, post 1962, had become the new \\"official\\" basis for Soviet psychology. In the two decades between a thaw in the suppression of scientific enquiry in Russia and the death of the Vygotsky's continuers,In the late 1970s, an entire generation of Soviet psychologists died: Luria and Meshcheryakov died in 1977, Leontiev and Ilienkov in 1979. (Ilienkov by his own hand. ‚Äì see: Blunden, 2009 \\"Soviet Cultural Psychology\\" ). contact was made with the West. =Developments in the West= Michael Cole, then a young Indiana University psychology post-graduate exchange student, arrived in Moscow in 1962 for a one-year stint of research under Alexandr Luria. Keenly aware of the gulf between Soviet and American psychology, he was one for the first Westerners to present Luria's and Vygotsky's idea to an Anglo-Saxon public.e.g.: Luria's \\"The Making of Mind\\" translated by Cole.Blunden, 2009 . This, and a steady flow of books translated from the RussianThe earliest books translated into English are Lev Vygotsky's \\"Thought and Language\\"(1962), Luria's \\"Cognitive Development\\" (1976), Leontiev's Activity, Consciousness, and Personality (1978) and Wertsch's \\"The Concept of Activity in Soviet Psychology\\" (1981). ensured the gradual establishment of a solid Cultural Psychology base in the west.\\"Historians may come to identify in Michael Cole the single most influential person for acquainting Western scholars to this tradition, both through his writings and through the mediating role of his Laboratory for Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California, San Diego\\" (). Another American scholar, James V. Wertsch, after completing his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1975, spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in Moscow to study linguistics and neuropsychology. Wertsch subsequently became one of the leading Western experts on Soviet Psychology.Other notable CHAT specialists: Jaan Valsiner (Estonian ‚Äì Clark University), Ren√© van der Veer (Dutch ‚Äì Leiden University) and Dorothy (Dot) Robbins (German‚Äì University of Central Missouri) Principal among the groups promoting CHAT-related research is Yjr√∂ Engestr√∂m's Helsinki-based CRADLE.Other CHAT-based centers of research and learning: Oxford Center for Sociocultural and Activity Theory Research (OSAT), International Society o Cultural and Activity Research(ISCAR), LCSD: Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC), Kansai University (Japan) CHAT: Center for Activity Theory .

In 1982 an Activity Conference, claimed to have been the first of its kind in Europe, organized by Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m to concentrate on teaching and learning issues, took place in Espoo (Fl), with the participation of experts from both Eastern and Western European countries. This was followed by the Aarhus (Dk) Conference in 1983 and the Utrecht (Nl) conference in 1984. In October 1986, West Berlin's College of Arts hosted the first ISCARHistory of ISCRAT (International Standing Conference for Research, on Activity Theory) International Congress on Activity Theory. This was also the first effort to bring together under one roof researchers, theorists and philosophers working in the tradition of the Soviet psychologists Leontiev and Vygotsky.Carl Shames, 1989 \\"On a significant meeting in West Berlin\\" The second ISCRAT congress took place in Lahti, (Fl) in 1990. ISCRAT became a formal legal organization with its own by-laws in Amsterdam, 1992. Other ISCRAT conferences: Rome (1993), Moscow (1995), Aarhus (1998) and Amsterdam (2002), when ISCRAT and the Conference for Socio Cultural Research merged into ISCAR.

In more recent years the implications of activity theory in organizational development have been promoted by the work Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m's team at the Centre for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research (CATDWR)now known as CRADLE, after the merger with the Centre for Research on Networked Learning and Knowledge Building at Helsinki at the University of Helsinki, and Mike Cole at the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California San Diego campus.(Selective) list of other CHAT-related research groups and centers: ATUL (Activity Theory Usability Laboratory at the University of Wollongong Australia ‚Äì \\"Organisations and communities of the Knowledge Age\\"). ; CHAT (Center for Human Activity Theory, Kansai University, Japan ‚Äì \\"Links with Helsinki, Bath and California\\"). ; OSAT (Oxford Centre for Sociocultural and Activity Theory Research at Oxford University UK. ‚Äì \\"Learning across the age range\\".) ; LIW (Learning in and for Interagency Working at the University of Bath, UK ‚Äì \\"Effective multiagency working\\".For other scholars/practitioners involved with CHAT see: \\"People in Cultural-Historical Activity Theory\\". =The three generations of activity theory= In his 1987 \\"Learning by expanding\\", Engestr√∂m offers a very detailed account of the diverse sources, philosophical and psychological, that inform activity theory. In subsequent years, however, a simplified picture has emerged from his and other researchers' work, namely the idea that (to date) there are three principal 'stages' or 'generations''Generations' does not imply a 'better-worse' value judgment. Each illustrates a different aspect and exists in its own right. of activity theory, or \\"cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). Whilst the first generation built on Vygotsky's notion of mediated action, from the individual's perspective, and the second generation built on Leont'ev's notion of activity system, with emphasis on the collective,An activity system is a collective in which one or more human actors labor to cyclically transform an object (a raw material or problem) in order to repeatedly achieve an outcome (a desired result). the third generation, which appeared in the mid-nineties, builds on the idea of multiple interacting activity systems focused on a partially shared object, and boundary-crossings between them.; Engestr√∂m, 2008, \\"The Future of Activity Theory\\" p. 6. First generation ‚Äì Vygotsky The first generation emerges from Vygotsky's theory of cultural mediation, which was a response to behaviorism's explanation of consciousness, or the development of the human mind, by reducing \\"mind\\" to a series of atomic components or structures associated primarily with the brain as \\"stimulus ‚Äì response\\" (S-R) processes. Vygotsky argued that the relationship between a human subject and an object is never direct but must be sought in society and culture as they evolve historically, rather than in the human brain or individual mind unto itself.Vygotsky saw the past and present as fused within the individual, that the \\"present is seen in the light of history\\" (). His cultural-historical psychology attempted to account for the social origins of language and thinking. To Vygotsky, consciousness emerges from human activity mediated by artifacts (tools) and signs.These artifacts, which can be physical tools, such as hammers, ovens, or computers; cultural artifacts, including language; or theoretical artifacts, like algebra or feminist standpoint theory, are created and/or transformed in the course of an activity, which, in the first generation framework, happens at the individual level. First Generation CHAT This idea of semiotic mediation is embodied in Vygotsky's famous triangular model: this original diagram ‚Äì (in which \\"X\\" stands for 'mediation') ‚Äì has subsequently been reformulated by, among others, the original triangle being inverted. which features the Subject (S), Object (O), and Mediating Artifact triad:. Vygotsky's triangular representation of mediated action attempts to explain human consciousness development in a manner that did not rely on dualistic stimulus‚Äìresponse (S-R) associations. in mediated action the Subject, Object, and Artifact stand in a dialectical relationship whereby each affects the other and the activity as a whole.\\"the dialectic relationship between subject and object as a fundamental unit of analysis for all human endeavour\\" For Vygotsky's idea of a \\"complex, mediated act\\" commonly expressed as a triad of subject, object and mediating artifact, see Vygotsky argues that the use of signs leads to a specific structure of human behavior, which breaks away from mere biological development allowing the creation of new forms of culturally-based psychological processes ‚Äì hence the importance of (cultural-historical) context: individuals could no longer be understood without their cultural environment, nor society without the agency of the individuals who use and produced these artifacts. The objects became cultural entities, and action oriented towards the objects became the key to understanding the human psyche.Vygotsky makes the point that \\"man himself determines his behavior with the help of an artificially created stimulus means.\\" (as cited by Norris Minick in Vol I of \\"The Collected Works of L.S. Vygotsky\\", 1987, PLENUM ‚Äì New York/London, p.21); In the Vygotskyan framework the unit of analysis, however, remains principally the individual. First-generation activity theory has been used to understand individual behavior by examining the ways in which a person's objectivized actions are culturally mediated.Mediation is perhaps the key theoretical idea behind activity: we don't just use tools and symbol systems; instead, our everyday lived experience is significantly mediated and intermediated by our use of tools and symbols systems. Activity theory helps frame, therefore, our understanding of such mediation. Besides a strong focus on material and symbolic mediation, internalizationIn Vygotskyan psychology internalization is a theoretical concept that explains how individuals process what they learned through mediated action in the development of individual consciousness. of external (social, societal, and cultural) forms of mediation, another important, aspect of first generation CHAT is the concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD), meaning, as advanced in Mind in Society (1978), \\"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers\\". ‚Äì Restated, ZPD is the theoretical range of what a performer can do with competent peers and assistance, as compared with what can be accomplished on one's own(; DeVane & Squire in ). ZDP is one of the major legacies of Vygotsky's work in the social sciences.see for example Collaborative learning. Second generation ‚Äì Leontiev While Vygotsky formulated practical human activity as the general explanatory category in human psychology, he did not fully clarify its precise nature. The second generation moves, beyond Vygotsky's individually-focused to A.N. Leontiev'sLeontiev, (variously spelled Leont'ev/Leontyev) was, with Alexander Luria, one of Vygotsky's pupils in the late 1920s and 1930s. After Vygotsky's death, Leontyev became the principal theoretical contributor within the Vygotskian social-historical school. collective model. In Engestr√∂m's now famous graphic depiction of second-generation activity, the unit of analysis has been expanded to include collective motivated activity toward an object, making room for understanding how collective action by social groups mediates activity.Leontiev's breakthrough was twofold: first he theorized activity as resulting from the confluence of a human subject, the object of his/her activity (predmet/–ü—Ä–µ–¥–º–µ—Ç(Russian) \\"the target or content of a thought or action\\" (Kaptelinin, 2005, p. 6), and the tools (including symbol systems) that mediate the object(ive); second, he saw activity as essentially tripartite in structure, being composed of unconscious operations on/with tools, conscious but finite actions which are goal-directed, and higher level activities which are object-oriented and driven by motives (Leontiev, at times, seems to conflate object and motive, which is potentially problematic). Hence the inclusion of community, rules, division of labor and the importance of analyzing their interactions with each other. Rules may be explicit or implicit. Division of labor refers to the explicit and implicit organization of the community involved in the activity. Engestr√∂m articulated the clearest distinction between classic Vygotskian psychology, which emphasizes the way semiotic and cultural systems mediate human action, and Leontiev's second- generation CHAT, which is focused on the mediational effects of the systemic organization of human activity. Second Generation CHAT In insisting that activity only exists in relation to rules, community and division of labor, Engestr√∂m expands the unit of analysis for studying human behavior from that of individual activity to a collective activity system. first popularized the triangular representation of the activity system in chapter 2.While the unit of analysis, for Vygotsky, is \\"individual activity\\" and, for Leontiev, the \\"collective activity system\\", for Jean Lave and others working around situated cognition the unit of analysis is \\"practice\\", \\"community of practice\\", and \\"participation\\". Other scholars analyze \\"the relationships between the individual's psychological development and the development of social systems\\". re: Minick in ; The collective activity system includes the social, psychological, cultural and institutional perspectives in the analysis. In this conceptualization context or activity systems are inherently related to what Engestr√∂m argues are the deep-seated material practices and socioeconomic structures of a given culture. These societal dimensions had not been taken sufficiently into account by Vygotsky's, earlier, more 'simple' triadic model:; in Leontiev's understanding, thought and cognition should be understood as a part of social life ‚Äì as a part of the means of production and systems of social relations on one hand, and the intentions of individuals in certain social conditions on the other.In the second generation diagram, activity is positioned in the middle, mediation at the top, adding rules, community and division of labor at the bottom. The minimum components of an activity system are: the subject; the object; outcome; mediating instruments/tools/artifacts; rules and signs; community and division of labor. In his famous example of the 'primeval collective hunt', Leontiev clarifies the crucial difference between an individual action (\\"the beater frightening game\\") and a collective activity (\\"the hunt\\"). While individuals' actions (frightening game) are different from the overall goal of the activity (hunt), they all share in the same motive (obtaining food). Operations, on the other hand, are driven by the conditions and tools at hand, i.e. the objective circumstances under which the hunt is taking place. To understand the separate actions of the individuals, one needs to understand the broader motive behind the activity as a whole: this accounts for the three hierarchical levels of human functioning:Kuutti, K. in ; ; ; object-related motives drive the collective activity (top); goals drive individual/group action(s) (middle); conditions and tools drive automated operations (lower level). ; ; ; DeVane & Squire in Third generation ‚Äì Engestr√∂m et al. After Vygotsky's foundational work on the individual's higher psychological functions and Leontiev's extension of these insights to collective activity systems,Engestr√∂m in questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, when, especially in the post-1990s, activity theory 'went international'. The work of Michael Cole and Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m in the 1970s and 1980s ‚Äì mostly in parallel, but occasionally in collaboration ‚Äì brought activity theory to a much wider audience of scholars in Scandinavia and North America.\\"[Activity Theory] is not only used in Russia, where it originated, but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the United States and other countries.\\". () Once the lives and biographies of all the participants and the history of the wider community are taken into account, multiple activity systems need to be considered, positing, according to Engestr√∂m, the need for a \\"third generation\\" to \\"develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives, and networks of interacting activity Systems\\".\\"Activities do not exist in isolation, they are part of a broader system of relations in which they have meaning.\\" () This larger canvas of active individuals (and researchers) embedded in organizational, political, and discursive practices constitutes a tangible advantage of second- and third-generation CHAT over its earlier Vygotskian ancestor, which focused on mediated action in relative isolation Third-generation activity theory is the application of Activity Systems Analysis (ASA)See \\"Activity Systems Analysis\\" (ASA) section below. in developmental research where investigators take a participatory and interventionist role in the participants' activities and change their experiences. Third-generation CHAT Engestr√∂m's now famous diagram, or basic activity triangle, ‚Äì (which adds rules/norms, intersubjective community relations, and division of labor, as well as multiple activity systems sharing an object) ‚Äì has become the principal third- generation model among the research community for analysing individuals and groups. Engestr√∂m summarizes the current state of CHAT with five principles: # The activity system as primary unit of analysis: the basic third-generation model includes minimally two interacting activity systems. # Multi-voicedness: an activity system is always a community of multiple points of views, traditions and interests. # Historicity: activity systems take shape and get transformed over long stretches of time. Potentials and problems can only be understood against the background of their own histories. # The central role of contradictions as sources of change and development. # Activity Systems' possibility for expansive transformation (cycles of qualitative transformation): when object and motive are reconceptualized a radically wider horizon opens up. Most often, learning technologists have used third- generation CHAT as a guiding theoretical framework to understand how technologies are adopted, adapted, and configured through use in complex social situations. Introduction: \\"A flurry of recent publications indicates that Activity Theory is proving a useful tool for studying work setting\\" She mentions, among others, Product design, Collaborative activity, Studies in creativity, Educational interventions. Although not as widely known in the US, Kirsten Foot mentions use of CHAT in Educational curricula development, Mental health care, Organizational processes and Public policy.More recently, Engestr√∂m has acknowledged that the third-generation model limited to analysing 'reasonably well-bounded' systems and that, in view of new, often web-based participatory practices a rethink is needed. (See \\"Fourth Generation\\" below.) Informing research and practice =Leontiev and social development= From the 1960s onwards, starting in the global South, and independently from the mainstream European developmental line,Erik Axel Leontiev's core Objective Activity conceptFrom the original –ü—Ä–µ–¥–º–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å(Russian) (predmetnaja-dejatelnost) and Gegenst√§ndliche T√§tigkeit(German), commonly translated as \\"Actividad Objetivada\\"(Spanish) ‚Äì see: , and as Objective Activity in English: e.g. Chapter 3 of , and Abstract:'Leontiev's concept of practice or Objective Activity'. (For \\"Objectivis/zed\\", see e.g.: : \\"Activity's secondary objectivised existence\\" and : \\"the mental image objectivised in its product\\"). \\"Objectivized Activity\\" is perceived to be closer to both the letter and the spirit of dynamic, interactive, dialectical weighting of Leontiev's original predmetnaya dyaetel'nost. has been used in a Social Development context. In the Organization Workshop's Large Group Capacitation-method,\\"Laboratories on Objectivized Activity\\" in: ; : \\"Actividad Objetivada\\"(Spanish) p. 53; \\"de Morais' antecedent thought on Objectivised Activity\\" in ; & note No. 2. objective/ized activity acts as the core causal principle which postulates that, in order to change the mind-set of (large groups of) individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity ‚Äì and/or to the object that \\"suggests\\" their activity. (Pre booklaunch chapter from \\"Unbounded Organization: Embracing the Societal Enterprise\\"). In Leontievian vein, the Organization Workshop is all about semiotically-mediated activities through which (large groups of) participantsMany of whom, historically, unemployed or underemployed persons with 'Lower Levels of Literacy' (LLLs) learn how to manage themselves and the organizations they create to perform tasks that require a complex division of labor. =CHAT-inspired research and practice since the 1980s= Especially over the last two decades, CHAT has offered a theoretical lens informing research and practice, in that it posits that learning takes place through collective activities that are purposefully conducted around a common object. Starting from the premise that learning is a social and cultural process that draws on historical achievements, its systems thinking-based perspectives allow insights into the real world.Mutizwa Mukute, M.& Lotz-Sisitka, H. 2012 \\"Working With Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and Critical Realism to Investigate and Expand Farmer Learning in Southern Africa\\". Rhodes University. SA. Change Laboratory (CL) Change Laboratory (CL) is a CHAT-based method for formative intervention in activity systems and for research on their developmental potential as well as processes of expansive learning, collaborative concept-formation, and transformation of practices, elaborated in the mid-ninetiesIn 1997, according to Santally et al., 2014, p. 3Sannino, 2008 \\"From Talk to Action: Experiencing Interlocution in Developmental Interventions\\" Sannino sees in Yves Clot's Vygotsky-inspired Clinic of Activity (Clinique de l'Activit√©) a potentially complementary ‚Äì (to CL, that is) ‚Äì intervention method. (See also Clot, Yves, 2009 Clinic of Activity: The Dialogue as Instrument in ). by the Finnish Developmental Work Research (DWR) group.Which became CRADLE in 2008. The CL method relies on collaboration between the practitioners of the activity being analyzed and transformed, and academic researchers or interventionists supporting and facilitating collective developmental processes. On the basis of Engestr√∂m's theory of expansive learning,Expansive learning is described by as a process which \\"begins with individual subjects questioning accepted practices, and it gradually expands into a collective movement or institution. ‚Äì The theory enables a \\"longitudinal and rich analysis of inter-organizational learning [] by using observational as well as interventionist designs in studies of work and organization\\". (Engestr√∂m & Kerosuo, 2007) the foundation of an interventionist research approach at DWR was elaborated in the 1980s, and developed further in the 1990s as an intervention method now known as Change Laboratory. CL interventions are used both to study the conditions of change and to help those working in organizations to develop their work, drawing on participant observation, interviews, and the recording and videotaping of meetings and work practices. Initially, with the help of an external interventionist, the first stimulus that is beyond the actors' present capabilities, is produced in the Change Laboratory by collecting first-hand empirical data on problematic aspects of the activity. This data may comprise difficult client cases, descriptions of recurrent disturbances and ruptures in the process of producing the outcome. Steps in the CL process: Step 1 Questioning; Step 2 Analysis; Step 3 Modeling; Step 4 Examining; Step 5 Implementing; Step 6 Reflecting; Step 7 Consolidating. These seven action steps for increased understanding are described by Engestr√∂m as expansive learning, or phases of an outwardly expanding spiral,Virkkunen, Makinen & Lintula in while multiple kinds of actions can take place at any time. The phases of the model simply allow for the identification and analysis of the dominant action type during a particular period of time. These learning actions are provoked by contradictions.Engestr√∂m.

It is based on Vygotsky's concept of mediated action and captures human activity in a triangle model that includes the subject, tool, object, rule, community, and division of labor. Subjects are participants in an activity, motivated toward a purpose or attainment of the object. The object can be the goal of an activity, the subject's motives for participating in an activity, and the material products that subjects gain through an activity. Tools are socially shared cognitive and/or material resources that subjects can use to attain the object. Informal or formal rules regulate the subject's participation while engaging in an activity. The community is the group or organization to which subjects belong. The division of labor is the shared participation responsibilities in the activity determined by the community. Finally, the outcome is the consequences that the subject faces because of his/her actions driven by the object. These outcomes can encourage or hinder the subject's participation in future activities.Yamagata \\"Activity Systems Analysis Methods In Part 2 of her video \\"Using Activity Theory to understand human behaviour\\", shows how activity theory is applied to the problem of behavior change and HIV and AIDs (in South Africa). The video focuses on sexual activity as the activity of the system, and illustrates how an Activity System Analysis, through a historical and current account of the activity, provides a way of understanding lack of behavior change in response to HIV and AIDS. In her eponymous book \\"Activity Systems Analysis Methods.\\", describes seven ASA case studies which fall \\"into four distinct work clusters. These clusters include works that help (a) understand developmental work research (DWR), (b) describe real-world learning situations, (c) design human computer interaction systems, and (d) plan solutions to complicated work-based problems\\". Other uses of ASA: Summarizing organizational change; Identifying guidelines for designing Constructivist Learning Environments; Identifying contradictions and tensions that shape developments in educational settings; Demonstrating historical developments in organizational learning., and Evaluating K‚Äì12 school and university partnership relations. ‚Äì For ASA and (computer-based) mathematics education see e.g. Human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI) When HCIHuman- Computer Interaction ‚Äì the study, planning, design and uses of the interfaces between people (users) and computers. first appeared on the scene as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, HCI adopted the information processing paradigm of computer science as the model for human cognition, predicated on prevalent cognitive psychology criteria, which, it was soon realized, failed to account for individuals' interests, needs and frustrations involved, nor of the fact that the technology critically depends on complex, meaningful, social, and dynamic contexts in which it takes place.Kuutti in Adopting a CHAT theoretical perspective had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies: the realization, for example, that a computer is typically an object of activity rather than a mediating artefact means that people interact with the world through computers, rather than with computer 'objects'.Kaptelinin, Victor \\"Activity Theory\\" in B√∏dker, S. \\"A Human Activity approach to User Interfaces\\" in: Human-Computer Interaction, 1989, Volume 4, pp.171‚Äì195 A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human‚Äìcomputer interaction design have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. Bonnie Nardi produced the ‚Äì hitherto ‚Äì most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature. Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT) SSAT builds on the general theory of activity to provide an effective basis for both experimental and analytic methods of studying human performance, using carefully developed units of analysis SSAT approaches cognition both as a process and as a structured system of actions or other functional information-processing units, developing a taxonomy of human activity through the use of structurally organized units of analysis. The systemic-structural approach to activity design and analysis involves identifying the available means of work, tools and objects; their relationship with possible strategies of work activity; existing constraints on activity performance; social norms and rules; possible stages of object transformation; and changes in the structure of activity during skills acquisition.This method is demonstrated by applying it to the study of a human‚Äìcomputer interaction task.; ; ; Future =Evolving field of study= The strengths of CHAT are grounded both in its long historical roots and extensive contemporary use: it offers a philosophical and cross-disciplinary perspective for analyzing diverse human practices as development processes in which both individual and social levels are interlinked, as well as interactions and boundary-crossings.Crossing boundaries involves \\"encountering difference, entering into [] unfamiliar territory, requiring cognitive retooling\\". Tuomi-Gr≈çhn & Engestr√∂m, 2003, \\"New Perspectives on Transfer and Boundary Crossing\\" p.4. between activity systemsKuutti, N. Ch 2 in More recently, the focus of studies of organizational learning has increasingly shifted away from learning within single organizations or organizational units, towards learning in multi‚Äêorganizational or inter‚Äêorganizational networks, as well as to the exploration and better understanding of interactions in their social context, multiple contexts and cultures, and the dynamics and development of particular activities. This shift has generated, among others, such concepts as \\"networks of learning\\"Miettinen in \\"Transcending traditional school learning: Teachers' work and networks of learning.\\" and \\"networked learning\\",Wikipedia, launched in 2001, is one of the most successful instances of networked learning to date. coworking, and knotworking.; Industry of late has seen strong growth in nonemployer firms (NEFs), thanks to changes in long-term employment trends and developments in mobile technologysee e.g. which have led to more work from remote locations, more distance collaboration, and more work organized around temporary projects. Developments such as these and new forms of social production or commons-based peer production, such as e.g. open sourceSoftware, the source code of which is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. development and cultural production in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, have become a key focus in Engestr√∂m's more recent work.Social production processes are simultaneous, multi-directional and often reciprocal. The density and complexity of these processes blur distinctions between process and structure. The object of the activity is unstable, resists control and standardization, and requires rapid integration of expertise from various locations and traditions. (Engestr√∂m in )see e.g. Engestr√∂m in: Hughes, Jewson & Unwin, 2007 Ch. 4. =\\"Fourth generation\\"= The rapid rise of new forms of activities characterised by web-based social and participatory practices,see e.g. Spinuzzi, 2010: shift from bureaucracies (1970s), to adhocracies (1990s), to all-edge adhocracies (2010s), in: \\"All Edge: Understanding the New Workplace Networks\\". ,By 2008, Engestr√∂m's examples become 'less bounded': runaway objects ‚Äì or 'partially shared large-scale objects in complex, distributed multi-activity fields'-, wildfire, and mycorrhizae-like activities, are examples of this shift. (; Engestr√∂m in ; ). phenomena such as distributed workforce and the dominance of knowledge work, prompts a rethink of the third-generation model, bringing with it the need, as suggested by Engestr≈çm, for a new, fourth generation activity system model.aka \\"4GAT\\" e.g. Ch. 19 \\"The Future of Activity Theory: A rough draft.\\" which activity theorists indeed have been working on in recent years.Fourth-Generation (4GAT) analysis should allow better examination of how activity networks interact and interpenetrate, and, at times, contradict each other. People \\"working alone together\\" may illuminate other examples of distributed, interorganizational, collaborative knowledge work. In fourth generation CHAT, the object(ive) will typically comprise multiple perspectives and contexts and be inherently transient; collaborations between actors, too, are likely to be temporary, with multiple boundary crossings between interrelated activities. Fourth- generation activity theorists have specifically developed activity theory to better accommodate Castells's (and others') insights into how work organization has shifted in the network society: they hence will focus less on the workings of individual activity systems (often represented by triangles) and more on the interactions across activity systems functioning in networks.For an example of a fourth generation analytical diagram see The 2017 ISCAR congress (August, Quebec City) has the following theme: 'Taking a 360¬∞ view of the landscape of cultural-historical activity research:The state of our scholarship in practice.

In 1958 he became one of the 111 members of the Party Central Committee in the German Democratic Republic. He had previously served as an ambassador and as government minister. Life =Early years= Handke was born into a working-class family in Hanau, a substantial town a short distance upstream of Frankfurt am Main. His father was a pipefitter. On leaving school he obtained a clerical traineeship with a bank. Following a further period at a commercially focused school he worked between 1913 and 1915 as a book- keeper. Between 1915 and 1918 he undertook war-time military service. He served on the front-line in France, Italy and Romania. =Politics= Weimar years Between 1911 and 1918 Handke was a member of Socialist Young Workers (SAJ / Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend) organisation. He joined the newly formed Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1917. The Independent Social Democrats had broken with the more mainstream SPD primarily on account of the existing party's continuing support for the war. Like many of the Independent Social Democrat's founder, Handke went on to join the Spartacus League at the end of 1918 and, in 1919, remained with it when it became the Communist Party of Germany. He took part in the founding meeting of the party's Hanau branch under the pseudonym \\"Ernst Spinger\\". From 1919 he was also the editor in chief of the locally produced workers' newspaper and sat on the Hanau local council as a Communist party councilor. Beyond his party activism he was also a member of the Soldiers' Council that emerged in Hanau as part of the wider revolutionary turmoil that spread across Germany directly after the war. During the early 1920s there was a further fragmentation of left wing parties in Germany, and following disagreements, apparently regarding tactics, in the wake of the March Action protests of 1921 Handke was among the Communist party members who broke away, following Paul Levi, to form the Communist Workers' Organisation. Handke rejoined the Communist party of Germany two years later (unlike Levi). In 1923 he joined the management team of the consumers' co-operative in Hanau, later also undertaking similar functions with the Co-op in Frankfurt. He was in addition, between 1923 and 1930, editor in chief of the Frankfurt \\"Arbeiter-Zeitung\\" (\\"Workers' Newspaper\\"). From 1930 till 1933 he was the leader of the Co-operatives department on the Communist Party Central Committee. Nazi years In January 1933 the (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in establishing one-party government. Opposition parties were not actually outlawed till two months later at the end of March, but by that time measures had already been enacted which rendered illegal a final meeting of the German Communist Party Central Committee that took place in Berlins's \\"Goat's Neck Sports Tavern\\" (\\"Sporthaus Ziegenhals\\") on 7 February 1933, and at which Handke was one of the 37 participants. Despite the party having been outlawed Handke continued to work for it during 1933/34. Less than a month after the Ziegelhaus meeting the Party leader, Ernst Th√§lmann, was arrested: he would later be shot after 11 years in solitary confinement. Two prominent figures from Germany's subsequent post-war history now managed to escape to Paris. Before the Nazi years were over both Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht would move on again, to Moscow, where they spent the war years, planning for a brighter future. Handke remained in Germany, however, and was arrested in Berlin on 21 September 1934, for taking part the previous evening in an illegal meeting in the Breitenbach Square (with Nikolaus Thielen and two other members of the outlawed Communist Party). On 2 July 1935 he appeared before the Berlin Special \\"People's\\" Court, faced with the usual (under these circumstances) charge of \\"Conspiring to commit High Treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). The court sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment: seven were to be spent in solitary confinement. Imprisonment and liberation Handke was incarcerated initially at Schwalmstadt. He was moved to Rockenberg in 1936, Butzbach in 1939, to Kassel- Wehlheiden in 1940 and finally to Zwickau in 1944. Unlike many Communist comrades imprisoned under the Nazis, in May 1945 when the war ended Handke was still alive. He was released from the jail in Zwickau by the US 3rd Army which arrived in town on 17 April 1945, and in May Handke was installed by the military administrators as mayor of Zwickau. Zones of occupation in what would remain of Germany had already been agreed between the wartime allies, and the arrival of the Americans in this part of the country ahead of the Soviet army was not something the politicians' plans had anticipated: Handke's home region of Saxony was scheduled to end up in the Soviet occupation zone. At the end of June the Americans withdrew their fighting forces from West Saxony into Bavaria, and on 1 July 1945 Zwickau was occupied by the Red army. Many of the quasi-political appointments made by the Americans in the area were quickly reversed by the Soviet Military Administration, but the Soviets were content to leave the new mayor of Zwickau in his post and in due course to expand his administrative responsibilities in the region, where he became head of the administration in Zwickau-Plauen For the entire Soviet occupation he was also appointed vice-president, and then president, of the German Trade and Supplies Administration between July 1945 and 1948. In Saxony, he also sat as a member of the regional legislature in 1949/50. At the same time the entire region was being developed into a separate stand-alone Soviet sponsored German state, the German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October 1949. Already in April 1946, the merging of the old Communist Party and more moderately left wing Social Democratic Party into the new Socialist Unity Party had created the basis for a return to one-party government. Handke, a long-standing member of the Communist Party, now no longer illegal in Germany, like thousands of others, had lost little time in signing over his membership to the new Socialist Unity Party. German Democratic Republic In 1947 Handke married Emmy Thoma, like him a former party activist who had been arrested in 1934 and spent the Nazi years in a succession of jails. Emmi's first husband, a fellow Communist called Karl Thoma, had been arrested back in 1933 shortly after the Reichstag fire, but he had been released later in the decade and gone to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Emmi had not seen him since her own arrest in 1934. Handke's political career assumed an increasingly national character within the East German state. Following on from his presidency of the Trade and Supplies commission, from 1948 till 1949 he was deputy president of the German Economic Commission. From October 1949 till November 1950 he served as a junior minister for inter-German trade, Foreign Trade and Supplies. His ministerial trade responsibilities continued till September 1952. Due to the policy setting role of the party, ministerial office was essentially a question of carrying out policies determined elsewhere, and Handke's work involved extensive travel and a relatively high public profile outside the German Democratic Republic. Recalling his work with the co-operative movement back in the 1920s in the Frankfurt region, he served between 1949 and 1952 as president of the Co-Op chain. He headed a trade delegation to Moscow in 1951/52, and further overseas experience came with his appointment, in October 1952, as his country's ambassador in Bucharest: a year later he was back working in Berlin where he became first deputy to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and at the same time a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Party Central Committee. Handke served on the Central Audit committee (Zentrale Revisionskommission) of the Party Central Committee between 1954 and 1958 and during this time was himself a candidate for Central Committee membership. In 1958 he became one of the Central Committee's 111 members. He also served as president of the Society for German‚ÄìSoviet Friendship from 1958 till 1962, in succession to (the younger) Friedrich Ebert. =Death and burial= Handke died in Berlin on 7 September 1962.

History  The club was founded in 2011 by a group of football fans. The club was named after the Belarusian word for ravens. After competing in the Belarusian amateur leagues for a few seasons, they joined the Belarusian Second League, the third division of Belarusian football, in 2014. With the help of some experienced players, the team was able to finish 2nd in their debut season in the third tier and was promoted to the Belarusian First League for the 2015 season. At the end of the 2015 season, Krumkachy successfully completed back- to-back promotions and were promoted to the Belarusian Premier League for the first time in their history after a 2‚Äì0 win against Dnepr Mogilev. Their first ever season in the Belarusian top flight was successful as they finished in 11th place. They followed this up with a good second season, again finishing in mid-table in 13th place. In early 2018, however, Krumkachy were excluded from the Premier League and demoted to the Second League due to persistent financial issues and payment delays as well as licensing issues. The club was restarted as a new legal entity. They finished 2nd in the 2018 Second League season and were again promoted to the First League. In early 2019, the club changed its name to NFK Minsk to avoid BFF membership clash with the old Krumkachy legal entity.

He provided a conceptual framework for the study of behavior organization and is regarded as one of the founders of ethology. Craig experimentally studied the behavioral expression of emotion, the way innate and learned behavioral tendencies are integrated, and how vocal as well as social behaviors are organized. He encouraged a view of behavior as an integrated process with evolutionary, motivational, experiential, social and ecological degrees of freedom. This integrative perspective helped shape modern behavioral science. Life, education, career and impact Wallace Craig was born on July 20, 1876, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Alexander Craig of Edinburgh, a Scottish immigrant to the United States, and Marion Brookes of London, an Englishwoman. He married Mima Davis Jenness of Sheffield on October 12, 1904. Craig graduated from Hyde Park High School, Chicago, Illinois, in 1895 and received both his Bachelor of Science degree (1898) and his Master of Science degree (1901) from the University of Illinois. From 1901 he studied with Charles O. Whitman and received his PhD from the University of Chicago, Illinois (1908), for his research on pigeon behavior. Craig worked as a high school science teacher (1900, Harlan, Iowa; 1900‚Äì01 Fort Collins, Colorado; 1904‚Äì05 Coshocton, Ohio), as a university assistant in zoology (1901‚Äì04, University of Chicago), and as a psychology and biology teacher (1905‚Äì07, State Normal School, Valley City, North Dakota). In 1903 and 1906, he was a student at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. After receiving his doctorate, Craig became a professor of philosophy at the University of Maine at Orono (1908‚Äì22). During this period Craig published most of his papers on the principles of behavior organization. These include a series of articles comparing the expression of emotions across different species of pigeons (1909‚Äì11), articles on time keeping and behavioral synchronization (1916, 1917), as well as conceptual papers on appetites and aversions (1917, 1918) and on fighting (1921). The circumstances surrounding the end of Craig's appointment at the University of Maine are not clear; determinants may include both a progressive loss of hearing and dissatisfaction with collegiality and with research conditions. After 1922, Craig's professional standing remained unstable. Thanks to support from Gordon Allport and James Woods of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology at Harvard University, Craig held various posts there until the mid-1930s (1922‚Äì23, lecturer in psychology; 1923‚Äì27, biophysics librarian; various other posts). He was unable to procure an established academic position or regular research program until 1937. During this period, Craig and his wife lived in Scotland for two years. In the mid-1930s the American ornithologist Margaret Morse Nice instigated a contact with Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian naturalist. Craig and Lorenz exchanged letters concerning key concepts of behavior such as reflex, instinct, taxis, tropism, learning, as well as search, appetitive and aversive behavior. None of these letters has been located to date. Together with Craig's published work, in particular his 1918 essay on appetites and aversions, they were regarded by Lorenz as foundational for the development of ethology. A key insight was that much behavior is expressed not in response to, but in search of sensory input ‚Äì or the lack of such input. With increasing appetite, animals engage in an undirected search for food, and only once located will the food stimuli be tracked down and consumption ensue. The role of learning in these processes is to provide ever more ‚Äòeducated guesses‚Äô during the initial search phase. In an essay from 1954, Lorenz refers to this view of a three-step organization of behavior as the Craig‚ÄìLorenz schema. Craig used a notably broad definition of appetite (p. 91, Craig 1918): ‚ÄúAn appetite (‚Ä¶) is a state of agitation which continues so long as a certain stimulus, which may be called the appeted stimulus, is absent. When the appeted stimulus is at length received it stimulates a consummatory reaction, after which the appetitive behavior ceases and is succeeded by a state of relative rest‚Äù. Likewise, he defined aversion as ‚Äúa state of agitation which continues so long as a certain stimulus, referred to as the disturbing stimulus, is present; but which ceases, being replaced by a state of relative rest, when that stimulus has ceased to act on the sense-organs.‚Äù One of the students of Lorenz, Monika Holzapfel, extended these notions to suggest that states of rest are goals of behavior (Holzapfel, 1940). Within his framework of appetites and aversions, Craig in his essay of 1921 described aggression as an aversion, in contrast to Lorenz, who regarded it as an appetite (Lorenz, 1966). From 1937, Craig worked as a temporary ornithologist at the New York State Museum, State University of New York, Albany, with the support of the director of this institution, Charles C. Adams. By the end of this appointment Craig had finished a monograph on the organization and psychology of bird song (1943). This monograph features an introduction by Adams and, despite being academic in character, an unusual preface by Craig directed at young ornithologists of the future. Adams, who had known and supported Craig since Craig's student days, mentions in his introduction that Craig had been interested in birds and bird song since boyhood and had a musical bent for the violin and flute. Funded by one-year grants from the American Philosophical Society (1944, 1945 and 1948) and by an appointment as a research fellow (1944‚Äì47, supported by E.G. Boring and Gordon Allport), Craig returned to Harvard and worked on an essay on ‚ÄúThe space system of the perceiving self‚Äù. A 127-page manuscript of four chapters of this essay, which in a letter to Boring, Craig mentions having sent to the Society, has not been located to date. Craig retired from Harvard in 1947. He moved to Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in 1953 and died there on April 25, 1954. In retrospect, Craig appears one of the most insightful students of behavior of the 20th century. The reasons why his insights did not resonate more strongly with his contemporaries, with few exceptions, and why these insights did not secure him academic success continue to be discussed.

Against Mysore in the quarter-final he scored 130 to help Bihar to a two-run first-innings lead and a place in the semi-final, which they lost to Punjab. He continued to play regularly for Bihar until 1977-78. Later he served as a selector for Bengal and as chief curator of pitches for East Zone. He was not related to Raja Mukherjee, who played as a batsman for Bengal in the late 1960s and 1970s.

As a stateless child, aged nine, he travelled alone to England to attend Fawley Court Polish school in Henley- on-Thames. He studied Physics at the University of Manchester and a subsequent job with Kodak led to a PhD in optometry and visual science at City University, London. From 2000 onward he was Professor of Psychology, first at the University of Sussex and then at the University of Bristol, where he worked until his death in 2011. Career In 1970, after leaving school, Tom worked for British Steel as a lab technician before taking a degree in Physics at The University of Manchester. A job at Kodak led to his finding an enduring interest in colour vision and to studying for a PhD in optometry and visual science at City University, London, supervised by Charles Pagham and awarded in 1978 for a thesis entitled 'Factors affecting colour saturation'. In 1979 he started a postdoctoral research position at the University of Bristol, where he worked for many years with Richard Gregory. For the year 1985‚Äì1986 Tom, his wife and young family, moved to Germany where Tom held a Research Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to work at the University of T√ºbingen Eye Hospital focusing on isoluminance (stimuli with the same luminance but differences in other visual properties) and its effects on the perception of form and motion. He became a lecturer at the University of Bristol in 1991 and spent most of the rest of his career there. He taught and coordinated undergraduate and postgraduate courses on perception, psychobiology, the ecology of vision, current vision, and the psychology of climate change, and supervised or co-supervised 17 PhD candidates. He also worked at the IBM UK Scientific Centre in Winchester and in 2000 briefly held a chair at the University of Essex. Between 2000 and 2002 he was Professor of Psychology at the University of Sussex. Returning to Bristol in 2002, he became Professor of Psychology in the Department of Experimental Psychology and founded the Cognition and Information Technology Research Centre (COGNIT), promoting an interdisciplinary approach to cognitive neuroscience. He was Principal Investigator on research grants from funders including the MRC, the BBSRC, and the EPSRC, and was a member of EPSRC Peer Review College. In 2007 he founded the Bristol Vision Institute. With Robert Snowden and Peter Thompson, he coauthored the textbook Basic Vision: An Introduction to Visual Perception; the first edition came out in 2006 and the second in 2012, soon after his death.  Personal life  In September 1977 he married psychologist Susan Blackmore. Their daughter Emily was born in 1982 and their son Jolyon in 1984. Using their children as experimental subjects, they devised a system called BabyTape which enabled babies to pull a cord to select which music they liked to listen to. The results showed that they preferred nursery rhymes to Status Quo. Tom and Susan were amicably divorced in July 2009. For some years Tom lived on his narrowboat, Lancer, in the floating harbour in Bristol, opposite the quay where the replica of The Matthew was being built. Later he moved to a house near the University in High Kingsdown, and for the last five years of his life his partner was an artist, Carol Laidler, whom he had met, typically, in Amsterdam. Research Tom's research interests were many and varied, ranging from colour vision in apes and birds to artificial vision systems for CCTV cameras to visual search in complex scenes, including for camouflage detection. He was particularly interested in the spatial and spectral properties of natural scenes in relation to the properties of biological systems, and in studying these interactions in species other than humans, in natural environments from the African rain-forest to Bristol's Leigh Woods. With Susan Blackmore, he contributed to the discovery of change blindness and worked on why misjudgments of probability lead people to believe in the paranormal. He was also involved in attempts to create a conscious robot with Iain Gilchrist and Owen Holland (funded by the EPSRC Adventure Fund). Other collaborators, from many different fields, included C. Alejandro P√°rraga and David Tolhurst on computational modelling, Katerina Mania on virtual reality, and Innes Cuthill and Julian Partridge on bird vision. In the last year or so before he died, Tom had also become very interested in the area of empirical aesthetics, specifically with reference to the feeling of 'presence' as affected by factors like screen size when watching movies. He was chief editor of the journal Perception for nearly 20 years, and the driving force behind the launch of its open-access sister journal i-Perception. He was associate editor of ACM Transactions on Applied Perception from 2004 until his death, and was long involved in the Applied Vision Association, becoming its secretary in 2003. A frequent and popular speaker at the European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP), he and Susan Blackmore organised its 11th meeting in Bristol in 1988. He was renowned for never taking the easy route to conferences but turning each trip into an adventure that might involve cars, trains, skis, his camper van, motorbike, and especially boats. A legacy he left to the Applied Vision Association was used to honour his contributions to vision science and particularly his extraordinary travels, by creating The Tom Tro≈õcianko Award to support a student to travel to ECVP in a way that Tom would have enjoyed. 280x280px Death Tom Tro≈õcianko died of heart failure on 16 November 2011 in Amsterdam, on his way to give lectures in Germany. TomFest , a celebration of his life and work, was held on 30 March 2012, involving a boat trip around Bristol harbour, and a series of short talks by colleagues, students, friends, and family, followed by dinner, wine-tasting, and music at the University of Bristol's Wills Memorial Building. On 2 September, a symposium on ‚ÄòSpace, colour, natural vision, and conscious robots‚Äô was held at ECVP 2012 in Alghero, Sardinia. The special exhibition, IllusoriaMente (meaning both illusorily and the illusory mind), was dedicated to the memory of the late Professor Richard Gregory and the late Professor Tom Tro≈õcianko.

Biography Elizabeth Rainforth was born in November 1814. She was the daughter of Sampson Rainforth, a custom-house officer, and she became a pupil of Tom Cooke, Domenico Crivelli, and George Perry, and subsequently, for dramatic action, of Mrs. Davison. She first sang in public at the vocal concerts, 29 February 1836, when she sang an aria from Der Freisch√ºtz. Her success was so pronounced as to lead to an immediate engagement for the succeeding concert in March. On 27 October in the same year Miss Rainforth made her stage d√©but as Mandane in Thomas Arne's Artaxerxes at the St James's Theatre, and for many seasons she was a popular dramatic singer at this theatre, the English Opera House, Covent Garden, and Drury Lane. At the same time her services as a concert-singer were in great demand. In 1837 she appeared in oratorio under the auspices of the Sacred Harmonic Society and in 1838 she was pictured in Bickerstaffe and Arne's Love in a Village in 1838. On 18 March 1839 she sang at the Philharmonic concerts; and in 1840 at the Concerts of Ancient Music. In 1836 and 1842 she was a principal singer at the Norwich Festival. In 1843 and 1845 her success at the Birmingham Festival and at the Worcester festival was no less emphatic; in 1844 she was performing in Dublin. On 27 November 1843 she created the r√¥le of Arline in Balfe's The Bohemian Girl. Rainforth appears to have been responsible for introducing the public to Lady Nairn's Jacobite song, The Hundred Pipers, some five or more years after that lady's death. Rainforth lived in Edinburgh from 1851 or 1852 to 1856, and contemporary publications post reviews of her performance of the song in the capital; and she published the song with her own (and the now standard) musical arrangement in 1852. She retired from public life in 1859, and until 1871 she taught singing at Windsor. In 1871 she withdrew to Chatterton Villa, Redland, Bristol, where she died 22 September 1877. Critical appraisal According to the Dictionary of National Biography, Miss Rainforth was an admirable singer, but lacked sufficient power to place her in the foremost rank of great sopranos.

History of clothing in the Indian subcontinent can be traced to the Indus Valley Civilization or earlier. Indians have mainly worn clothing made up of locally grown cotton. India was one of the first places where cotton was cultivated and used even as early as 2500 BCE during the Harappan era. The remnants of the ancient Indian clothing can be found in the figurines discovered from the sites near the Indus Valley Civilisation, the rock-cut sculptures, the cave paintings, and human art forms found in temples and monuments. These scriptures view the figures of human wearing clothes which can be wrapped around the body. Taking the instances of the sari to that of turban and the dhoti, the traditional Indian wears were mostly tied around the body in various ways. Indus Valley Civilisation period  Evidence for textiles in Indus Valley Civilisation are not available from preserved textiles but from impressions made into clay and from preserved pseudomorphs. The only evidence found for clothing is from iconography and some unearthed Harappan figurines which are usually unclothed.Keay, John, India, a History. New York: Grove Press, 2000. These little depictions show that usually men wore a long cloth wrapped over their waist and fastened it at the back (just like a close clinging dhoti). Turban was also in custom in some communities as shown by some of the male figurines. Evidence also shows that there was a tradition of wearing a long robe over the left shoulder in higher class society to show their opulence. The normal attire of the women at that time was a very scanty skirt up to knee length leaving the waist bare. Cotton made headdresses were also worn by the women. Women also wore long skirt, stitched tight tunic on their upper body and trousers as well. Inferences from mother goddess statue from Delhi national museum suggests female wearing a muslin like top which is thinner in contrast to thicker garment worn as skirt, this garment may as well be linen. There also evidences of men wearing trousers, conical gown/tunic with an upper waist band. The mother goddess statues show women also wearing heavy earrings which were also pretty common in the historic period of India and also depict with heavy necklaces with overhanging medallion with holes in them for gemstones. Female statues and terracotta arts and figurines like a dancing girl also depict long hairs probably braided and draped in cloth. Fibre for clothing generally used were cotton, flax, silk, wool, linen, leather, etc. One fragment of colored cloth is available in pieces of evidence which are dyed with red madder show that people in Harappan civilisation dyed their cotton clothes with a range of colors. One thing was common in both the sexes that both men and women were fond of jewelry. The ornaments include necklaces, bracelets, earrings, anklet, rings, bangles, pectorals, etc. which were generally made of gold, silver, copper, stones like lapis lazuli, turquoise, amazonite, quartz, etc. Many of the male figurines also reveal the fact that men at that time were interested in dressing their hair in various styles like the hair woven into a bun, hair coiled in a ring on the top of the head, beards were usually trimmed. Indus Valley Civilization men are frequently depicted wearing headbands especially to contain hair bun at the back. People have been shown wearing elaborate headdresses like turban, conical hats, pakol hats. Dressing of Indus valley civilization people show presence of multi-ethnic people of diverse backgrounds for instance people have been depicted wearing Pashtun style pakol hat with a chocker like neck ornament as well as Punjabi style pagri and Rajasthani style bangles and necklaces and many other styles prominent in neighbouring regions of the Indian subcontinent. Some scholars, such as Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, have argued that headdress from the royal cemetery of Ur is an import from Indus Valley Civilization since similar headdresses have been found to have been depicted in many of its Mother Goddess figurines and actual ones discovered from sites such as Kunal and the floral depiction in gold leaves of species native to Indian subcontinent such as Dalbergia sissoo or pipal, and since no such ornamentation has been shown in Mesopotamian art itself.

Ancient and Classical periods  = Vedic period = The Vedic period was the time duration between 1500 and 500 BCE. The garments worn in the Vedic period mainly included a single cloth wrapped around the whole body and draped over the shoulder. People used to wear the lower garment called paridhana which was pleated in front and used to tie with a belt called mekhala and an upper garment called uttariya (covered like a shawl) which they used to remove during summers. \\"Orthodox males and females usually wore the uttariya by throwing it over the left shoulder only, in the style called upavita\\". There was another garment called pravara that they used to wear in cold. This was the general garb of both the sexes but the difference existed only in size of cloth and manner of wearing. Sometimes the poor people used to wear the lower garment as a loincloth only while the wealthy would wear it extending to the feet as a sign of prestige. In the Rig Veda, mainly three terms were described like Adhivastra, Kurlra, and Andpratidhi for garments which correspondingly denotes the outer cover (veil), a head-ornament or head- dress (turban) and part of woman's dress. Many pieces of evidence are found for ornaments like Niska, Rukma were used to wear in the ear and neck; there was a great use of gold beads in necklaces which show that gold was mainly used in jewellery. Rajata-Hiranya (white gold), also known as silver was not in that much of use as no evidence of silver is figured out in the Rig Veda. In the Atharva Veda, garments began to be made of the inner cover, an outer cover, and a chest-cover. Besides Kurlra and Andpratidhi (which already mentioned in the Rig Veda), there are other parts like as Nivi, Vavri, Upavasana, Kumba, Usnlsa, and Tirlta also appeared in Atharva Veda, which correspondingly denotes underwear, upper garment, veil and the last three denoting some kinds of head-dress (head-ornament). There were also mentioned Updnaha (Footwear) and Kambala (blanket), Mani (jewel) is also mentioned for making ornaments in this Vedic text.  Pre-Mauryan era  Even though scholars have debated the archaeological evidence from the pre-Mauryan era, a lot of terracotta artifacts by various scholars have been dated to the pre- Mauryan era which shows continuity of the dressing styles leading up to the Mauryan period. The terracotta also contain naturalistic style of depicting human faces just like Mauryan periods. The pre-Mauryan periods have been marked by the continuation of Indus arts and depict elaborate headdresses, conical hats with heavy earing. Bronze rattling mirror excavated from Pazyryk dated to 4th century BC also depict Indians wearing typical Indian classical clothing such as dhoti wrap and tight-fitting half sleeved stitched shirts like kurta. Another pre-Mauryan archaeological evidence of Indian dressing comes from Saurashtra janapada coins which are one the earliest representation of Indian pre-Mauryan arts. The coins are dated between 450-300 BCE and have been repeatedly over struck just like punch-marked coins. File:Ajatshatru - ASI.jpgStatue of Magadhan king Ajatshatru wearing drapes.

During the Mauryan dynasty (322‚Äì185 BC) the earliest evidence of stitched female clothing is available from the statue of Mother Goddess(from Mathura, 3rd century BCE). Ladies in the Mauryan Empire often used to wear an embroidered fabric waistband with drum headed knots at the ends. As an upper garment, people's main garb was uttariya, a long scarf. The difference existed only in the manner of wearing. Sometimes, its one end is thrown over one shoulder and sometimes it is draped over both the shoulders. In textiles, mainly cotton, silk, linen, wool, muslin, etc. are used as fibers. Ornaments latched on to a special place in this era also. Some of the jewellery had their specific names also. Satlari, chaulari, paklari were some of the necklaces. Men wore Antariya(knee-length, worn in kachcha style with fluted end tucked in at centre front) and Tunic (one of the earliest depictions of the cut and sewn garment; it has short sleeves and a round neck, full front opening with ties at the neck and waist, and is hip length). A statue of a warrior shows Boots (fitting to the knees cap) and band (tied at the back over short hair). A broad flat sword with cross straps on the sheath is suspended from the left shoulder.

Chandragupta I was the founder of this empire. Stitched garments became very popular in this period. Stitched garments became a sign of royalty. The antariya worn by the women turned into gagri, which has many swirling effects exalted by its many folds. Hence dancers used to wear it a lot. As it is evident from many Ajanta paintings, women used to wear only the lower garment in those times, leaving the bust part bare but these depictions may be a stylistic representation of mother goddess cult since Indus Valley Civilization. Whereas women with stitched upper body garment or tunic have been shown from pre-Mauryan period as early as 400 BCE in a folk art depicted on Pazyryk rattling mirrors. Ujjain coin from 200 BCE depicts a man wearing achkan. Depictions from terracotta clay tablets from Chandraketugarh show women wearing clothes made of muslin. Various kinds of blouses (cholis) evolved. Some of them had strings attached leaving the back open while others were used to tie from the front side, exposing the midriff. Clothing in the Gupta period was mainly cut and sewn garments. A long sleeved brocaded tunic became the main costume for privileged people like the nobles and courtiers. The main costume for the king was most often a blue closely woven silk antariya, perhaps with a block printed pattern. In order to tighten the antariya, a plain belt took the position of kayabandh. Mukatavati (necklace which has a string with pearls), kayura (armband), kundala (earring), kinkini (small anklet with bells), mekhala (pendant hung at the centre, also known as katisutra), nupura (anklet made of beads) were some of the ornaments made of gold, used in that time. There was extensive use of ivory during that period for jewellery and ornaments. During the Gupta period, men used to have long hair along with beautiful curls and this style was popularly known as gurna kuntala style. In order to decorate their hair, they sometimes put headgear, a band of fabric around their hairs. On the other hand, women used to decorate their hair with luxuriant ringlets or a jewelled band or a chaplet of flowers. They often used to make a bun on the top of the head or sometimes low on the neck, surrounded by flowers or ratnajali (bejewelled net) or muktajala (net of pearls).

Ancient Indians wearing kurta and baggy pants like shalwar have been depicted in 8-10th century CE ivory sculpture of an elephant chess piece from Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris, France. From the Late medieval period, there are increased evidences of pajamas and shalwar becoming common in Indian attire while unstitched dhoti keeps its prominence as well. From Al- Biruni's Tarikh ul Hind. The kurtas, which are called Kurtakas in Sanskrit, are half sleeved shirts with slits of both sides are described along with other clothing such as Kurpasaka which is a type of jacket similar to kurta, he also mentions that some Indians preferred dhoti while others dressed more by wearing baggy trousers similar to shalwar. The Alchi painting also shows evidence of modern sari draping and Bagan temple paintings frequently depict Indians with long beards wearing big earing. Paintings from eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, including Bihar, Bengal, and Nepal depict various clothing attires of eastern Indian states including modern styles of wearing dupatta.

Early Modern period  =Mughal Empire = A woman in Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, clad in fine Bengali muslin, 18th century. The Mughal dynasty included luxury clothes that complemented interest in art and poetry. Both men and women were fond of jewellery. Clothing fibers generally included muslins of three types: Ab-e-Rawan (running water), Baft Hawa (woven air) and Shabnam (evening dew) and the other fibers were silks, velvets and brocades. Mughal royal dresses consisted of many parts as listed below. Mughal women wore a large variety of ornaments from head to toe. Their costumes generally included Pajama, Churidar, Shalwar, Garara and the Farshi , they all included head ornaments, anklets, and necklaces. This was done as a distinctive mark of their prosperity and their rank in society. During the Mughal period, there was an extensive and pervasive tradition of wearing embroidered footwear, With ornamented leather and decorated with the art of Aughi. Lucknow footwear was generally favoured by nobles and kings. =Rajputs = Maharana Pratap with Rajput-style clothing. Rajputs emerged in the 7th and 8th century as a new community of Kshatriya people. Rajputs followed a traditional lifestyle for living which shows their martial spirit, ethnicity, and chivalric grandeur.  Men  Rajput's main costumes were the aristocratic dresses (court-dress) which includes angarkhi, pagdi, chudidar pyjama and a cummerbund (belt). Angarkhi (short jacket) is long upper part of garments which they used to wear over a sleeveless close-fitting cloth. Nobles of Rajputs generally attired themselves in the Jama, Shervani as an upper garment and Salvar, Churidar-Pyjama (a pair of shaped trousers) as lower garments. The Dhoti was also in tradition in that time but styles were different to wear it. Tevata style of dhoti was prominent in the desert region and Tilangi style in the other regions.  Women  \\"To capture the sensuality of the female figures in Rajput paintings, women were depicted wearing transparent fabrics draped around their bodies\\". Rajput women's main attire was the Sari (wrapped over whole body and one of the ends thrown on the right shoulder) or Lengha related with the Rajasthani traditional dress. On the occasion (marriage) women preferred Angia. After marriage of Kanchli, Kurti, and angia were the main garb of women. The young girls used to wear the Puthia as an upper garment made of pure cotton fabric and the Sulhanki as lower garments (loose pajama). Widows and unmarried women clothed themselves with Polka (half sleeved which ends at the waist) and Ghaghra as a voluminous gored skirt made of line satin, organza or silk. Another important part of clothing is Odhna of women which are worked in silk. Jewellery preferred by women were exquisite in the style or design. One of the most jewellery called Rakhdi (head ornament), Machi-suliya (ears) and Tevata, Pattia, and the aad (all is necklace). Rakhdi, nath and chuda show the married woman's status. The footwear is the same for men and women and named Juti made of leather. = Sikhs = Sikhism was founded in the 15th century. In 1699, the last guru of Sikhism, Guru Gobind Singh mandated Khalsa Sikh men to have uncut hair for their lives, which they wear into a turban or dastar. The dastar has since then been an integral part of the Sikh culture.  British Colonial period  During the British Colonial period, Indian clothing, especially among the nobles and educated upper classes, began to reflect a clear European influence. The sherwani evolved as a fusion of the British frock coat and an achkan. Clothes went many changes during the colonial period in India. This led to transformation and also conflicts of caste among peoples. This happened when the Western-style dress came into effect in India. The hat was also worn by the people of several religions. This was not because of protection from the sun but sign of respect. Some Indians wore western dresses when they used to go out and changed at home with their traditional dresses.  Post- Independence  Western clothing has gained increasing popularity, especially in the metropolitan cities. This has also led to the development of the Indo- Western style. Bollywood has also been a major influence in fashion around the subcontinent, especially in Indian fashion.

Kearon became Director of the Irish School of Ecumenics serving from 1999 until 2005. He was Secretary General of the Anglican Consultative Council of the Anglican Communion, from 2004 to 2014. During this time he courted controversy by suggesting in an email that he believed Archbishop Rowan Williams was 'fostering schism'. =Episcopal ministry= In September 2014, it was announced that Kearon had been elected as the next Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe. On 24 January 2015, he was consecrated a bishop during a service at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. The principal consecrator was Michael Jackson, Archbishop of Dublin, and the co- consecrators were Pat Storey, Bishop of Meath and Kildare, and Patrick Rooke, Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. During the Irish referendum campaign on abortion in 2018, Kearon expressed support for the removal of the constitutional ban on abortion, arguing that modern biology supports the contention of early church fathers such as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas that life does not begin at conception. Later the same year, he also supported the removal of references to blasphemy in the constitution. Personal life In 1978, Kearon married Jennifer Poyntz. As such, his father-in-law is Samuel Poyntz. They have three daughters. Honours Kearon holds honorary degrees from General Theological Seminary (2006), and Berkeley Divinity School (2015).

The flowers are sometimes fragrant in warm weather. The single leaf is linear to lance-shaped, long and up to wide, leathery with a dark upper and pale lower surface. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described by Robert Brown in 1810 in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (suaveolens) is derived from the Latin suaveolens meaning \\"sweet-smelling\\". Distribution and habitat The species occurs in woodland areas of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Use in horticulture As with other Australian terrestrial orchids, this species is not well known in cultivation but success has been achieved by growing it in a shadehouse of 50-70% shadecloth.

Lara, also a historian. Head of Pointe-√†-Pitre's Guadeloupe Litt√©raire journal, he arrived in France in 1914 with hopes of further developing his project of a literary and political journal. He was soon engulfed in the first World War until 1919 and following traumas caused by the inhalation of gases used during the war, he was inspired to become a historian. Upon his return from war, he published a history of Guadeloupe, a text which was used to teach several generations of Guadeloupean school children. In 1919, he founded the monthly Le Monde Colonial (The Colonial World) which echoed W.E.B. Dubois' and the first Pan-African Congress' denunciations of the racism inherent to European colonialism. In 1923 he wrote the novel Question de Couleurs: Blanches et Noirs, Roman de Moeurs ( i.e. An issue of Colors: Whites and Blacks, a Novel) Career as a typographer and pressman Born in Guadeloupe, Oruno Lara worked from the age of 11 as an apprentice typographer at the press for the paper La V√©rit√©, which had been founded in 1888. He was then hired as a typographer at Courrier de la Guadeloupe and at La R√©publique in 1900. He went on to become an editor at L'Ind√©pendant de la Pointe-√†-Pitre (1901) and at the papers La D√©mocratie, La V√©rit√©, at L'√©mancipation and at Le Nouvelliste, founded by his brother Hildevert-Adolphe in 1909. Their brother Augereau founded L'Homme Encha√Æn√© (aka The Chained Man) and L'Action. Oruno Lara eventually created the journal La Guadeloupe Litt√©raire, publishing the work of local poets. Legacy as a historian Lara was the first Guadeloupean historian to break from the dominant historiography of French colonial planters and administrators by looking at the totality of influences on Guadeloupe, beyond just the French colonialist narrative. He was also the first to strive to transmit this history to Guadeloupean children, against great odds. He wrote in the preface to his 1921 book La Guadeloupe physique, √©conomique, agricole, commerciale, financi√®re, politique et sociale de la d√©couverte √† nos jours (1492-1900): \\"It is really the job of one of us to write our own history; and when born of yesterday we seem to have neither past nor official identity, it behooves one of us to erect a more beautiful past... Ignorance of yesterday is a great weakness.\\" His La Guadeloupe de la D√©couverte √† Nos Jours was the first history book about Guadeloupe written by a non-white. Writing style and racial consciousness Despite emulating the writing style of white creole writers from his native Guadeloupe, Lara is noted as being among the first non-white Guadeloupean authors to assert black or mulatto consciousness and to write on race, racial tension and colorism. Ancestors, siblings and spouse Oruno Lara's father Mo√Øse Lara had been a slave until 1843. Mo√Øse's mother Bertilde had been a slave until 1848. Mo√Øse Lara was freed from slavery at the age of 21 in 1843 while he was a cook. Mo√Øse Lara then moved to Pointe- √†-Pitre where he worked as a carpenter while collaborating to the creation of the paper Le Progr√®s in 1849. That same year he participated in demonstrations against the electoral campaign for the legislative Assembly of the candidate Bissette who was an ally of the French planters of Martinique. Mo√Øse wrote a letter to the Progr√®s registering his disapproval. Born in 1822, Mo√Øse Lara worked hard to leave his children extensive documentation of events that he witnessed, in addition to his convictions. Mo√Øse married Oruno's mother Am√©lie P√©durand in 1879. They had four children: Hildevert-Adolphe (1876), Oruno (1879), Augereau and Ferlande. Am√©lie had been born in 1848 to a mulatto woman from Grands Fonds in Sainte-Anne, Guadeloupe who died of cholera in 1865. She often told stories from the times of her husband Mo√Øse's demonstrations and political agitation against slavery and the colonial order. Oruno had another brother, Mo√Øse's first son Sully Lara who wrote novels and essays. This legacy likely motivated Oruno Lara's publication of his book on Guadeloupean history in 1921 which he published with the help of his wife‚Äîteacher and poet Agathe R√©ache‚Äîagainst great odds: unemployment, archives far away in Europe, war and disease. =Origins of the name Lara= Oruno Lara's father Mo√Øse adopted the name Lara after he was emancipated from slavery. Oruno D. Lara has written that the name was likely inspired by the fact that Mo√Øse's ancestors were from Venezuela. Heirs Oruno Lara's grandson Oruno D. Lara, a prolific historian, was born after his death. Another grandson Christian Lara, is a noted filmmaker. Oruna Lara's great-grandson is Kernan Heinz, named after a well-known Spanish historian called Hernan Cortes.

History Pearson Brothers started out in 1899 when Frederick Pearson bought a former ironmongery store called Wigglesworth based at 56 Long Row, which was rented. Frederick changed the name of the business to Pearsons and employed his two sons, Charles William and Tom, a porter and a small boy. The business not only had a shop but an office and a cellar with a water pump. By 1894, electricity was being introduced to Nottingham, and Pearsons employed an electrical engineer to do contract work for customers. The store supplemented the electrical contract work by selling electrical goods within the store, becoming an official dealer for many products, including The Hoover Company in 1925. The business was growing quickly and the first of many extensions was built in 1898 at the rear of the store to accommodate a showroom for the new firegrates that the company had designed. Over the next three decades, the business expanded the store in both size and the goods that it sold. However, the business slumped during the 1920s while the Council House was being built, as did many companies in the vicinity. But, in the 1930s, the business grew again by expanding the store and purchasing a secondhand motor vehicle for deliveries. The gramophone listening room was converted into a caf√© during this decade, and the lease was extended with the property owner, Mr Joseph Darby, in 1934. During the 1930s, Laurie Pearson, son of Tom (one of the Pearson Brothers), invented and patented the first safe and practical electric blanket, while a special lift was added to cope with the different levels of floors. After the war, the business celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 1949, and by the end of the 1950s had become an authorised dealer for His Master Voice products from EMI, Coke and Gas burning appliances from East Midlands Gas Board, Redfyre Oil Heaters from Newton, Chambers and Co Ltd, and the sale of Silver from Mappin & Webb, among others. The company was also providing street lighting to the city and fire fighting equipment. In 1966, the next major development to the store opened, with the new entrance on Upper Parliament Street in a Scandinavian style to try and modernize the firm's appearance. By 1986, the store had a coffee shop and a Planters restaurant, and opened a new ¬£100,000 fashion floor. Closure The freeholders for the property where the store was built wanted to redevelop the location as an arcade and gave notice in 1987 to the grandson of the founder Robert Pearson. A fight was put up but unfortunately, by October of that year, the business accepted the offer for the lease. In January 1988, the store closed its doors for the last time, with the loss of 115 jobs. After the development failed to materialize, it was dropped during 1990 by the owners Grosvenor Properties of London after their plans to demolish the Georgian fa√ßade was objected to. In 1993, planning permission was given to turn the site into a multi-storey car park and government offices. By 1996, no work had taken place and a fire destroyed the interiors of the building. The Upper Parliament building was eventually demolished to make way for the multi-storey development, while the Long Row buildings have since been converted into new retail space.

Alain Hubert has been going on major polar and mountaineering expeditions. His achievements include being the first Belgian to ever reach the North Pole in 1994 with Didier Goetghebuer, a world record crossing of the Antarctic continent (3924 km in 99 days) with Dixie Dansercoer in 1998 and 5 attempts at summitting Mount Everest. The Arctic Arc expedition with Dixie Dansercoer in 2007 was the First ever Siberia-Greenland crossing via the North Pole. During his expeditions, Alain Hubert witnessed the pace and magnitude of climate change first hand and dedicated himself to that cause. He collaborates with scientists and collects ground data for them during his expeditions (for example snow depth ground data for Cryosat during his Arctic Arc Expedition). He is one of the founders of the International Polar Foundation, with Andr√© Berger and Hugo Decleir. The International Polar Foundation supports polar scientific research, and promotes informed action on climate change and the development of a sustainable society. During the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 BELARE Campaigns, the International Polar Foundation built the first ever \\"Zero Emissions\\" Antarctic Research Station: Princess Elisabeth Antarctica.Mayence, J.-F., & de Lichtervelde, A., \\"Science and peace: the legal destiny of Antarctica\\", in de Lichtervelde, Demoiti√©, Du Brulle, Lepoivre, Mayence, Renard, Vancauwenberghe, Scheers, Starckx, & Verweire, eds., Belgium and Antarctica: Exploration, Science and Environment (Brussels: Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, 2008), p. 7.

It was the regal capital of the Badami Chalukyas known as 'vatapi' then, from 540 to 757 AD. It is famous for rock cut architecture and other structural temples. It is located in a ravine at the foot of a rugged, red sandstone outcrop that surrounds Agastya lake. Badami is surrounded in the north and south by forts built in later times, from the ramparts that crown their summits.Michell, George (2014). Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas. India : Niyogi Books. p. 37. .  Introduction  The north fort which is on the opposite side of the town is penetrated by deep canyon-like crevices, through which climbs a straight path. The first features to be seen along this path are two freestanding, multi-storeyed mandapas, seemingly unconnected with any temples. They are possibly vestiges of an early ceremonial complexes. Lower Shivalaya stands on a nearby rocky terrace, surveying the houses beneath. At the summit of north fort, upper Shivalaya is sited majestically overlooking the town beneath. Both these were probably erected in the early 7th century, but appear to have partly dismantled mostly by conquering pallava forces; and maybe they have been pillaged for building blocks to strengthen north fort by later occupiers. The ruinous condition of this monument contrast with the comparatively intact Malegitti Shivalaya, which crowns on an isolated boulder beneath the western flank of the North fort. This temple is also dated to the first half of the 7th century and is of historical interest for its well-preserved cravings.Michell, George (2014). Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas. India : Niyogi Books. p. 37. .  Lower Shivalaya  Only the towered sanctuary of the temple does exist today; its outer walls have been dismantled. The sanctuary was originally surrounded by a passageway on three sides, possibly with a mandapa extension to the east which can be predicted by observing the broken roof slabs set into its walls and the stumps of beans with friezes of ganas. The temple's doorway is framed by bands of lotus ornament. An unusual, elliptical pedestal is seen within which happens to be empty now. The outer walls have flat pilasters but there are no signs of projections or sculptures niche. The roof is an octagon to dome topped by a tiny amalaka finial. It is framed by corner model elements topped by kuta roofs containing miniature nidhis.Michell, George (2014). Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas. India : Niyogi Books. p. 65.  Upper Shivalaya  The outer walls of the temple create a rectangle containing a sanctuary with a passageway on three sides, opens into a columned mandapa on the east, missing all its internal columns. The walls are built on a basement with a central recessed course containing foliate ornament and narrative scenes. On the south face, Ramayana episodes are pictured, like, waking of Kumbhakarna, Rama fighting with forest enemies. Panels on the west face depict the birth and childhood of Lord Krishna, including Krishna sucking Putana‚Äôs breasts. Though there are no narratives seen on the north. The walls above have narrow projections by pilasters carried up into the parapet, four on the south and three on the west. The central pilastered projections have panels depicting Krishna lifting Mount Govardhana (south), Narasimha disemboweling his victim (north), etc. These support miniature eaves and kudus, the latter intruding in the kapota eaves. The square tower over the sanctuary has pilastered walls. It is crowned by a large kuta, without finial, the earliest and best preserved example of this type of Dravida styled roof in Early Chalukya architecture.Michell, George (2014). Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas. India : Niyogi Books. p. 66.  Malegitti Shivalaya  This temple is the earliest surviving example of the Dravida style in Early Chalukya architecture. It consists of a sanctuary, without passageway, opening into a triple aisled mandapa. Walls of sanctuary and mandapa have a curved course and a central recessed portion, divided into panels, some filled with gana musicians, dancers and warriors. The mandapa walls have three projections on the north and south, among which the middle one accommodates panels portraying Shiva (south) and Vishnu (north). Each god is accompanied by a pair of diminutive companions. The mandapa walls, beside the porch, have a corner pilastered projection and a single niche containing a swaying dvarapala. The sanctuary and mandapa walls are overhung by continuous kapota eaves on a frieze of ganas. Two recessed moldings support a parapet, with a set of corner kutas and central shalas over the mandapa walls, and a similar, kuta-shala-kuta parapet over the sanctuary walls. There is a tower rising over the sanctuary, above which rises the octagon-to-dome roof, exactly like that of upper Shivalaya, but without amalaka finial. The mandapa interior has a central east-west aisle, defined by raised floor strips linking the free-standing and engaged columns. Two additional columns define a small bay in front of the sanctuary doorway. Transverse beams carried on open-mouthed makara brackets carry the raised and horizontal roof slabs, with vishnu on flying Garuda carved onto the central bay. The sanctuary doorway is framed by jambs, including those with serpent bodies culminating in a flying Garuda over the lintel, with male and female figures beneath at either side. A linga on a pedestal, perhaps replacing a sculpted icon, is seen within the sanctuary.Michell, George (2014). Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas. India : Niyogi Books. p. 71.

Reception Following the film's Irish premi√®re, NextProjection called the film a \\"juicy jaunt of a tale,\\" and said that \\"like a Raymond Chandler 'cannibalisation', Candlestick may feed off the familiar, but it's the sport with which it spits it back out that makes it feel so fresh\\". The film won three awards at the 30 Dies Fantastic Film Festival, Andorra: best screenplay (Forg√°cs W. Andr√°s and Christopher Presswell); best original score (Jonathan Armandary); and best actor, shared by Andrew Fitch, Isla Ure, Nigel Thomas and Tom Knight.

He was the first resident Seventh-day Adventist missionary on Tonga, and founded the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Tonga. Missionary Edward Hilliard was born on 3 April 1851 in Madrid, St. Lawrence County, New York. His parents were converted to Adventism when he was a child, and he was brought up in that faith. He became an Adventist pastor. In 1895 the Mission Board sent him to Tonga, then called the Friendly Islands, as a missionary. Adventists on the schooner Pitcairn had first visited Tongatapu, the main island of the Kingdom of Tonga, in 1891. Hilliard arrived at Tongatapu on 30 August 1895 with his wife Ida Hilliard and their two-year-old daughter Alta. They lived in temporary quarters while Edward Hilliard built a four-room cottage. Around November 1895 Ida Hilliard began to teach school, first in their temporary home and then in their cottage. The number of pupils reached a peak of 28, each paying $3 per quarter. Hilliard built a small school room near his cottage. The Hilliards brought two Tongan boys into their home to try to train them as missionaries. To earn extra income Hilliard worked part-time as a carpenter. He slowly learned the Tongan language and translated some tracts into this language. Hilliard's work was mainly limited to the small papalagi (European) colony on \\"the beach\\". He was no longer young and found the local language difficult. In August 1896 Edwin Butz and his wife Florence arrived on the fifth voyage of the Pitcairn. They were accompanied by two Pitcairn Islanders, Sarah and Maria Young, descendants of Bounty mutineer, midshipman Ned Young. In 1897 Dr. Merritt Kellogg and Eleanor Kellogg joined them. In these early years the missionaries made little progress, in part handicapped by their dietary regulations. Drinking kava and eating pork are important in Tongan social life but are prohibited by the Adventists. Before Hilliard left Tonga in 1899 he reported that a Sabbath School with 31 members met regularly. Most of the attendees were the missionaries and the school children. The children's parents only attended occasionally. On 10 September 1899, shortly before leaving Tonga, Hilliard gathered the missionaries into his home and organized them into a church. The Butz and Kellogg families were the charter members. Later years After four years in Tonga the Hilliards moved to Australia for eight years, then spent thirteen years in Tasmania. Sarah Young accompanied the Hilliards to Australia where she completed her training as a nurse. A young part-Tongan called David or Horace Holland also sailed to Australia with the Hilliards, and studied at Avondale College from 1900‚Äì01. He was baptized, but later broke the school's rule and left. In 1928 Hilliard moved to Bangalore, India with his wife, daughter and son-in-law Pastor Christiansen. Hilliard suffered from heart disease. He died in Bangalore on 18 September 1936, aged 85. The Hobart Seventh-Day Adventist school near Hobart, Tasmania was renamed on 1 September 1994 to the Hilliard Christian School in honor of Edward Hilliard, who had led the Seventh-day Adventist church in Tasmania for four years.

Rivers in Southeast Asia There are many rivers that run throughout Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, there is the Batang Kerang floodplain, which is located in Balai Ringin, Sarawak and is home to many species of fish including Oxygaster anomalura. In Batang Kerang, there are streams that are shaded by canopy vegetation. They have developed steep, muddy banks that have been affected by the frequent rise and fall of water levels. Areas where swamps or peaty soils develop, the waters can be seen as heavily colored. These dark, colored streams are commonly known as black water streams or rivers. Black water rivers are typically highly acidic, with pH ranging from 3.6 - 5.9, with low dissolved organic and suspended solids. When observed with transmitted light, the river gives off a tea color. It gives off a black color when seen with reflected light.Ibrahim, Eza. ‚ÄúDISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION OF FISH FAUNA BETWEEN WET AND DRY SEASON IN BATANG KERANG, BALAI RINGIN, SARAWAK.‚Äù 2006. Besides black water rivers, there are also brown rivers in Batang Kerang. These rivers are often brown and muddy due to its high sediment contents. Some areas of the brown water are marked by extensive floating vegetation. Freshwater Fish Composition in Batang Kerang Research had been done before with there being studies of spatial and temporal patterns of diversity, distribution and species composition of freshwater fishes. These studies helped examine factors influencing the structure of the fish community (Belliard et al., 1997; Galactosa et al., 2004). However much of these studies occurred in other locations in the world, most notably, in the Amazon River. Between September 2004, and January 2005, researchers investigated the freshwater fish diversity and composition in the brown and black water rivers of Batang Kerang. To conduct this study, the researchers focused on several factors that could have affected the outcome. Among the factors were pH, temperature (¬∞C), and dissolved oxygen concentration. The results of their study showed that a total of 234 individual fish from 36 species and 13 families were collected. Both the black and brown water habitats showed different fish species compositions. In the brown water, a total of 152 fish from among 32 species were caught, with 25 being exclusive to the habitat. The fish in the brown water were primarily made up of the family Cyprinidae. Oxygaster anomalura was the most abundant fish collected. Meanwhile, in the black water river, 82 individual fish from 12 species were caught. The most abundant fish caught was the Helostoma temminckii. During this study, only seven species of families were found in both habitats.

This architecturally distinctive former carriage barn was probably built in the 1890s, and is demonstrably based on a pattern published in Shoppell's Modern Houses, an architectural pattern book. Outbuildings constructed from such patterns are extremely rare, and this one is in excellent condition. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The construction history of this particular building is not very well known. The property was acquired in 1881 by Almira T. Dix from her father in 1881, with an additional acre added in 1892. The building is assumed to have been built around this time, along with the Dixes' elaborate residence, which has not survived. Its builder is unknown, but it is clearly based on pattern 589 in Shoppell's Modern Houses, published in 1889. Although the practice of building from mail-order pattern books like this one was widespread, surviving instances of outbuildings with a documented connection to them are extremely rare. The building was moved about onto a new concrete foundation in the late 1980s. The building is a roughly square wood frame structure, two stories in height. It has an unusual roof line, with its main ridge line running from side to side, with clipped ends. The front facade has a large pent gable with a smaller projecting section at the top, and there is a rear hip-roof projection. A gable-roofed ventilator crowns the main ridge line. The building is sheathed with clapboards on the first floor, and with weathered shingles above. The main facade has a track-mounted vehicle entry door at the center, flanked on each side by twelve-pane fixed windows. At the second level, which is separated from the first by a flaring of the siding, is a double door above the vehicle entry, flanked by small six-pane windows. This is sheltered by a triangular projecting gable. The shingling on this facade is scallop-cut. The interior was originally designed to house carriages and provide stabling for one or two horses. The downstairs walls were finished with wainscoting, while the upper loft area was unfinished.

It is named after the nearby Stephansdom, which is sometimes known as \\"Steffl\\".  History  The M. Neumann Department Store, designed by Otto Wagner and built in 1895-1896, previously stood on the site of the current store. On 11-12 April 1945, the store caught fire during the Vienna Offensive and was demolished in 1949 due to war-time damage. In 1949-50, Carl Appel built a new, nine-storey (from -1 to +7) development for the Neumann company, which has been known as the Steffl Department Store since 1961. K√§rntner Strasse had not yet been pedestrianized at that time. On 1 May 1979, a fire was detected in the women's clothing department on the second floor and 900 m¬≤ of retail space went up in flames. The smell of burning was again detected during the clean-up process and police discovered an incendiary device with a time fuse. The following day, two other incendiary devices were discovered in a neighbouring department store. The \\"Erster Mai\\" (First of May) organisation described the attacks as protests against capitalism.Kurt Stimmer: 1979 ‚Äì das Jahr der gro√üen Wiener Brandkatastrophen [1979 ‚Äì The Year of the Great Fire of Vienna], in: Wien at. aktuell - Magazin f√ºr Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter [Wien.at aktuel l ‚Äì Topical News Magazine for Employees of the City of Vienna] , ed. press and information service of the City of Vienna, No. 6 / 2009 The ownership structure of the store has changed several times in recent decades. The Konsum √ñsterreich consumer cooperative indirectly became one of the temporary owners but shrank from a large company to a small business in 1995 due to a sensational collapse of their accounts. The store was completely renovated in the 1990s. In 2007, the businessman Hans Schmid acquired the property and the operating company. Since then, gradual remodeling and repositioning has begun and has already been completed on several levels. The total floor space comes to around 13,000 square meters. The department store is visited by up to 30,000 people per day. The top floor is home to the \\"Sky Bar\\" bar and restaurant. The only Global Blue tax free office in the centre of Vienna is also located in the building.

The book examines the history of the relationship as well as its current trajectory. Its introduction begins with 'The China-Pakistan axis plays a central role in Asia's geopolitics, from India's rise to the prospects for a post-American Afghanistan, from the threat of nuclear terrorism to the continent's new map of mines, ports and pipelines. China is Pakistan's great economic hope and its most trusted military partner'.

The China‚ÄìPakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics is his first book. Andrew Small was educated at Balliol College, University of Oxford. Andrew Small Introduction to the book The Beijing-Islamabad axis plays a central role in Asia's geopolitics, from India's rise to the prospects for a post- American Afghanistan, from the threat of nuclear terrorism to the continent's new map of mines, ports and pipelines. China is Pakistan's great economic hope and its most trusted military partner; Pakistan is the battleground for China's encounters with Islamic militancy and the heart of its efforts to counterbalance the emerging US-India partnership. For decades, each country has been the other's only ‚Äòall-weather‚Äô friend. Yet the relationship is still little understood. The wildest claims about it are widely believed, while many of its most dramatic developments are hidden from the public eye. This book sets out the recent history of Sino-Pakistani ties and their ramifications for the West, for India, for Afghanistan, and for Asia as a whole. It tells the stories behind some of its most sensitive aspects, including Beijing's support for Pakistan's nuclear program, China's dealings with the Taliban, and the Chinese military's planning for crises in Pakistan. And it describes a relationship increasingly shaped by Pakistan's internal strife, and the dilemmas China faces between the need for regional stability and the imperative for strategic competition with India and the USA.Douban reading:The China-Pakistan Axis Book reviews Some reviews of this book: ‚Äò‚Ä¶an excellent book.‚Äô ‚Äî Anatol Lieven, New York Review of Books ‚ÄòAn impressive account of a little-understood friendship...Six years of research have enabled Mr Small to produce a detailed account of decades of close dealings between the two countries.

Pakistan and China have been ‚Äúall weather friends‚Äù for more than fifty years in spite of their ideological differences. Andrew Small shows that their rapprochement resulted mostly from a real politik assessment of their common enemy, India, but that non material variables are back in the picture today because of the Islamist connection in the case of the Uighurs, for example. The strength of Small's work lies in its analysis of the fascinating scope and trajectory of the Beijing‚ÄìIslamabad relationship.‚Äô ‚Äî Christophe Jaffrelot, Research Director at CNRS, Sciences Po and author of The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience ‚Äòoutstanding new book‚Ä¶ Small pulls [the history] together deftly and with meticulous sourcing.

Built c. 1840, it is a rare surviving example of an Acadian log house, and the only one known to be near its original location. It was built by one of a father-son pair, each named Jean-Baptiste Daigle, and moved a short distance about 20 years after its construction. It is now covered by weatherboard siding, obscuring its log structure. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Daigle House is a rectangular structure, 1-1/2 stories in height, set at the northeast corner of Dub√© Street and East Main Street (United States Route 1) in Fort Kent. Its exterior is finished in Masonite siding, and it has a side- gable roof with a single brick chimney projecting near the center of the roofline. The front (west-facing) facade is symmetrical, with a center entry flanked by pairs of sash windows. The entry is sheltered by a gable-roofed porch. The side walls have two windows on each level, and a louver in the attic. The rear has a small projecting gable-roof ell, and the back door is an original thick batten door. The interior generally follows a central hall plan, providing access to four rooms on the first floor and stairs to the second floor. The second floor has a single bedroom on the south side, and a large unfinished open area to the north, in which the house's log construction is exposed. Interior finishes vary, but notably include original wide pine flooring and exposed log structure in the downstairs northwest room. The construction method used to build the house is a traditional Acadian piece sur piece method, in which sawn logs are place one atop the other, set in a post- and-beam frame which supports the roof. This method is distinct from other construction methods seen in the region, including those used by early English settlers and later 19th-century Swedish immigrants. The place where the Daigles owned their land was in territory disputed between Massachusetts (which Maine was part of prior to its 1820 statehood) and New Brunswick. This dispute was resolved with the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which established the Saint John River as the border in the Fort Kent area. The Daigles had owned land in this area since at least 1790, when they were given a British grant. Various records ascribe different construction dates to this house, ranging from 1839 to 1844, the latter being the year of the younger Jean- Baptiste's marriage. The house remained in the hands of Daigle's descendants until 2007, when it was transferred to the Fort Kent Historical Society. The society is preparing the house for use as a museum.

The 10 IFCA Districts cover English coastal waters out to 6 nautical miles from Territorial Baselines. Although autonomous the 10 IFCAs have a shared 'vision' to \\"lead, champion and manage a sustainable marine environment and inshore fisheries, by successfully securing the right balance between social, environmental and economic benefits to ensure healthy seas, sustainable fisheries and a viable industry\\". The IFCAs have shared powers and duties which are found in the Marine and Coastal Access Act, 2009. The 10 IFCAs are: * Southern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Devon and Severn Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Cornwall Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Isles of Scilly Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Northwestern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Northumberland Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * North Eastern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Eastern Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Kent and Essex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority * Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority The membership of IFCA committees is made up of 'general members' appointed by the Marine Management Organisation for their skills and experience relevant to the management of inshore fisheries. The general members are joined by local authority appointed members, appointed by the constituent authorities which fund the IFCAs. On each IFCA a member is also appointed from Natural England, the Marine Management Organisation and the Environment Agency. Under s.153 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (1) The authority for an IFC district must manage the exploitation of sea fisheries resources in that district. (2) In performing its duty under subsection (1), the authority for an IFC district must: (a) seek to ensure that the exploitation of sea fisheries resources is carried out in a sustainable way, (b) seek to balance the social and economic benefits of exploiting the sea fisheries resources of the district with the need to protect the marine environment from, or to promote it recovery from, the effects of such exploitation, (c) take any other steps which in the authority's opinion are necessary or expedient for the purpose of making a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development, and (d) seek to balance the different needs of persons engaged in the exploitation of sea fisheries resources in the district Under s. 154 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act, 2009 IFCA must further the conservation objectives of marine conservation zones. IFCAs are funded by Local Authorities and this funding is, in part, underpinned by DEFRA via an Area Based Grant of c. ¬£3 million annually. Since the IFCAs were created in 2011 they have been responsible for transforming the way fishing activities are undertaken in Marine Protected Areas as a consequence of the UK government's \\"revised approach to the management of commercial fishing in European Marine Sites\\" and have introduced 17 byelaws to protect the most vulnerable features within European Marine Sites. Southern IFCA has introduced measures which restrict Bottom Towed Fishing Gear from 25% of the IFCA District. IFCAs are also progressing measures to balance the needs of the commercial and recreational fisheries and examples of emerging plans are seen in Devon and Severn IFCA. The 10 IFCAs each own and operate Fisheries Patrol Vessels, which range from the 27m coastal Patrol Vessel FPV Saint Piran operated by Cornwall IFCA to smaller rigid inflatable vessels. The IFCAs also operate research vessels, deploying side scan sonar and underwater cameras to inform their management. Every four years a report on the conduct and operations if IFCAs is presented to the UK parliament. The report 2014 to 2018 found that IFCAs \\"have demonstrated the local leadership that is expected of them as statutory regulators\\" and that \\"future funding, compounded by increasing responsibilities, also emerges as a significant factor in the effective delivery of the IFCAs' statutory duties\\".report The IFCAs are represented nationally by an Association, The Association of Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities.

Sanaria‚Äôs vaccines are based on the use of the sporozoite (SPZ) stage of the malaria Plasmodium parasite as immunogen. The SPZ stage of the malaria parasite is inoculated into humans by mosquito bite. Sanaria has developed the technology to grow and harvest aseptic, purified Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) SPZ and formulate them for use in vaccines for human use. Pf is responsible for the most of the approximately 500,000 deaths caused by malaria annually. Sanaria's most advanced candidate vaccine is called Sanaria¬Æ PfSPZ Vaccine, which uses radiation attenuated (weakened) SPZ, that cannot divide or cause disease, to induce these protective immune responses. Sanaria is developing other PfSPZ vaccines, including Sanaria¬Æ PfSPZ-CVac, which uses non-attenuated, infectious PfSPZ administered along with antimalarial drugs to induce protective immunity, and Sanaria¬Æ PfSPZ-GA1, which uses genetically attenuated PfSPZ as immunogen. Sanaria is also developing a vaccine that will prevent malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, the second most important cause of malaria world-wide. Additionally Sanaria produces PfSPZ products for clinical research. Sanaria¬Æ PfSPZ Challenge consists of purified, aseptic, non- attenuated PfSPZ and is used for controlled human malaria infections to assess the efficacy of new vaccines and drugs against malaria, and resistance to malaria.. As of 2020 a collaboration with the University of T√ºbingen, Sanaria Inc. and Protein Potential are developing a vaccine against COVID-19: OraCOV with promising development.www.sanaria.com Mission statement Sanaria's primary mission is to develop and commercialize whole-parasite PfSPZ vaccines that confer high-level, long-lasting protection against Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria parasite responsible for more than 95% of malaria-associated severe illness and death world-wide and the malaria parasite for which there is the most significant drug resistance. The overall mission includes developing vaccines that prevent all human malaria and to use those vaccines to immunize entire populations in geographically defined areas to halt malaria transmission and thereby eliminate malaria. History Sanaria moved into its first facility in Rockville, MD in July 2003 supported by a phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a $4.09M grant from the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity Group to further develop its vaccine. In 2007, Sanaria received a $29.3-million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), administered through the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) which supported the construction of their manufacturing facility in Rockville, MD. In 2009, Sanaria received approval from the FDA to test the vaccine in human trials, the results of which have now been published in multiple high impact and internationally peer reviewed journals. Sanaria¬Æ PfSPZ Vaccine has shown high level protection against, both controlled human malaria infection and naturally transmitted malaria, infection by Plasmodium falciparum. Sanaria received FDA Fast Track Designation in 2016. Clinical Trials Nineteen clinical trials of PfSPZ Vaccine have been completed or are being conducted in Tanzania, Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Germany, the Netherlands, and the U.S.. Seven clinical trials of PfSPZ-CVac have been conducted in the Netherlands, the U.S., Germany, Equatorial Guinea and Mali. PfSPZ-GA1 is being assessed in its first clinical trial in the Netherlands. PfSPZ Challenge has enabled research teams worldwide to conduct controlled human malaria infection studies in the U.S., the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Tanzania, Kenya, Mali, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Gambia. i-PfSPZ-C Sanaria‚Äôs entire R&D; process is conducted with the collaboration of the International PfSPZ Consortium (i-PfSPZ-C), a group of ~200 investigators and funders from ~40 organizations in ~20 countries who are dedicated to development of whole PfSPZ malaria vaccines that can be used to prevent malaria in individuals and systematically eliminate malaria from geographically defined areas of the world. In addition to the U.S. NIAID, U.S. DoD, and the BMGF, significant funding for development of PfSPZ vaccines has come from the Government of Equatorial Guinea and the corporate social responsibility arms of three U.S. energy companies (Marathon Oil, Noble Energy and AMPCO), Top Institute Pharma (the Netherlands), universities in Nijmegen and Leiden, the Netherlands, the University of T√ºbingen, the German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute and the Swiss Government, and the Tanzanian Commission on Science and Technology.

Structure Traditionally, a trust based pension scheme is established by an employer for its employees. Representatives of that employer will then usually form the majority of the trustee board which is responsible for governing the trust. By contrast, a master trust is typically set up by a provider, often an insurance company. There is one legal trust and one trustee board, but a number of non-associated employers can participate in the scheme. Each participating employer will have one or more sections within the master arrangement. The trustee takes on governance responsibility for each section on things such as investment funds and service providers and will ensure compliance with regulatory duties. The decisions over benefit and contribution levels will normally remain with each participating employer. Running costs It is normal for the sponsoring employer to cover the running costs of its trust based scheme, with members having some exposure to investment fees. Within master trusts it is usual for members to bear the majority of scheme costs. Some master trust providers may charge participating employers a set-up or implementation fee, but ongoing employer fees are unusual. It is common for pension schemes in the UK to have fewer members than schemes in other nationsPension World article setting pout the benefits of master trust arrangements meaning that they are less able to capture economies of scale in investments and administration than larger schemes. By pooling the scale of several employers, master trusts should be able to provide access to these savings. However, following the introduction of The Pensions Act 2008, and concerns that members might be overcharged the UK Government announced Link to the UK Government web page covering the consultations on plans to apply a charge cap a cap on the fees that could be levied on automatically enrolled members of pensions schemes. Governance While master trusts are set up to be separate from their provider, many have questioned the independence of the trustee boards. In a traditional trust based scheme, the trustees are able to replace their service providers, such as administrators or investment managers. However, because of the potential closeness of the provider and their master trust board, the trustees may not have this power in a master trust. In response, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in association with The Pensions Regulator developedTPR announces release of draft assurance framework a voluntary assurance framework to provide independent assurance reports for the trustees of master trusts. The framework was designed to evidence the key quality features set out in The Pensions Regulator‚Äôs code of practice for defined contribution schemes.TPR‚Äôs code of practice for defined contribution schemes on the TPR website Growth Master trust pension schemes have existed for many years, but came to prominence after the introduction of automatic enrolment. In April 2014 Professional Pensions Article discussing the One millionth member of NEST it was estimated that master trusts had accounted for around two thirds of individuals automatically enrolled in the UK.

When speaking about the black metal scene and adoption of corsepaint for atmospheric purposes, Maier states: > As for the image: we like to think of ourselves as sophisticated and > thinking individuals that live their beliefs in everything, not just on > stage, and we would feel like a bunch of morons if we lowered ourselves to > the level of idiocy of the usual black metal clich√©s. Contrary to other > bands, we actually try to say something, even though we know some people > only get happy if you mention Satan or bathe in your own (or someone else's) > vomit. We are not schizophrenic in that sense; we don't pretend to be some > random, under-researched lord of hell with a clown face on stage and go back > to being a complaining, miserable cog in the machine who hates his life > after the show. =Alkaloid= Progressive Metal supergroup Alkaloid was formed in 2014, initially set up as a collaboration between Hannes Grossmann, Christian M√ºnzner, Danny Tunker and Linus Klausenitzer. Grossmann invited Maier to join on guitar and vocalist duties. Maier said \\"it was just impossible to say no (and not join the band)\\". The band stated that their first record, 'The Malkuth Grimoire', did not receive support from any labels because it was too diverse and hence unmarketable. Consequently, they crowdfunded the album, receiving more than $21,000 dollars in donations from fans across the world. Grossmann stated that a central reason for his departure from death metal band Obscura was to collaborate with Maier.http://www.maximummetal.com/interviews/intresults.asp?ID=hannesgrossman_alka&idBand;=1569 Concerning Maier's ability, Grossmann said \\"he is the best composer I have ever worked with\\". Speaking of Maier's abilities, guitarist Christian M√ºnzner said that \\"The guy is probably the most amazing guitar player I ever met.\\" Documentary In 2014, the Netherlands Public Broadcasting network NPO released a 50-minute documentary about Maier's life and his composition of a double-guitar concerto, featuring Izhar Elias, entitled \\"Schattenspiel\\" (\\"Shadowplay\\") for the Zaterdagmatinee, whose performance took place at the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.http://www.nocleansinging.com/2014/05/24/a-metal-dude-in-the- concert-hall-the-story-of-florian-magnus-maier/#more-75607 In this documentary, Maier speaks about his childhood, heavy metal during his formative years, familial support and transition to flamenco and classical style guitar playing and composition. Hypermobility Maier played flamenco guitar with Paco Pe√±a until 2006, at which he was diagnosed with hypermobility, and reverted to electric and acoustic guitars. He is unable to use his thumb for traditional flamenco picking, so incorporates flamenco influences in his electric guitar based music.

It holds the only Community Radio licence in the Channel Islands which was granted in 2014 to the Alderney Broadcasting Company (a non-profit organisation, limited by guarantee). The scheme under which community radio stations were established in the United Kingdom by Ofcom originally did not apply to the Channel Islands, each of which has separate legal systems. Further legislation was in order needed to enable the establishment of community radio stations in the Islands.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-22523397 After representations from the QUAY-FM volunteers who had been operating an twice- yearly RSL and from the Government of Alderney,http://alderney.gov.gg/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=74961&p;=0 this was enabled by the extension, by Order-in-Council of the relevant parts of the UK's Communications Act, 2003 to the Bailiwick of Guernsey.http://www.commedia.org.uk/news/2014/06/channel-islands-get-first- community-radio-station/ Applications were invited by Ofcom in December 2013http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/radio/community/thirdround/Invitation_Guernsey_December_2013.pdf and closed in March the following year. This application round resulted in a licence being granted to the Alderney Broadcasting Company Limited, a non- profit company incorporated in Alderney, limited by guarantee (company number 1899) which was the only applicant within the Bailiwick, no applications having been received from either Guernsey or Sark. History The station was founded in the summer of 2000 by a number of volunteers, several of whom had backgrounds in BBC Radio, independent local radio (ILR) in the UK, and university radio. The station was originally authorised to transmit on 87.7 MHz FM under a Restricted Service Licence (RSL) issued by the UK's Radio Authority. It broadcast only during the peak summer vacation period, including Alderney Week. In 2004, a regular Christmas broadcast period was added. The station equipment was kept available to be activated in times of civil emergency, which happened once during extreme weather conditions in the winter of 2010 (which was nicknamed \\"SNOW FM\\" locally, although the familiar QUAY-FM name was used on-air). Since the start of 2015, QUAY-FM has broadcast year- round under a Community Radio Licence issued by Ofcom (successor licensing body to the Radio Authority). Live, year-round transmissions were commenced at 7:00 a.m. on 12 February 2015 with the first transmission being made by Tim Butler (who was one of the original presenters on the very first RSL broadcasts in August 2000) presenting the Early Morning Show.http://www.itv.com/news/channel/2015-02-12/quay-fm-starts-broadcasting- year-round-from-today During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, QUAY-FM became a vitally important part of the Island's contingency measures, with President Tate making daily broadcasts to update islanders on the situation during the emergency powers lockdown and in the period during which restrictions were eased.
