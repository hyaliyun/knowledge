After reforming the output is approximately 80% fuel gas and 20% cokes. In staged reforming technology, gas conversion is a separate stage after pyrolysis. First stage Organic material is decomposed into gas and coal at approximately 600¬∞C. Second stage Gas produced by the first stage is reformed with water vapor and heat energy from the cokes into a dust and residue-free fuel gas.

Librettist and translator Nuitter studied law and practised in Paris from 1849. He was a keen theatre-goer, and in the 1850s he started writing librettos, mainly vaudevilles, later op√©ras comique, operas bouffes, operettas and ballets. It is estimated that he wrote or co-authored around 500 theatrical pieces, including libretti for several works by Offenbach, the scenario for L√©o Delibes's ballet Copp√©lia (Nuitter had wanted the piece to be called La poup√©e de Nuremberg) and pieces by Herv√©, Guiraud, Lalo, Lecocq and others, of which 100 or so were staged.Gressel V.

Website of enssibs (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Sciences de l'Information et des Biblioth√®ques), accessed 28 October 2008. He helped translate Wagner's operas into French (Tannh√§user, 1861, Rienzi, 1869, Lohengrin 1870 and The Flying Dutchman, 1872). Other translations include I Capuleti e i Montecchi, Oberon, Abu Hassan, Die Zauberfl√∂te, and Verdi's Macbeth, Aida, La forza del destino and Simon Boccanegra. Wagner and Verdi esteemed highly the quality of his translations, and he assisted Verdi over the revision of Don Carlos in 1882‚Äì83.Budden J.: Verdi. J M Dent & Sons, London, 1985. From a different era, Nuitter's translation of La Pri√®re du matin et du soir by Emilio de' Cavalieri (1600) was performed regularly at the Concerts du Conservatoire during the 1870s‚Äì80s and beyond.Holoman, D. Kern: The Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire 1828‚Äì1967. University of California Press, 2004. Archivist Becoming involved in the archives of the Paris Opera in 1863, he became official archivist there three years later, and ended his career in law (he had given legal advice to Offenbach in a dispute with the manager of the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens prior to the 1864 premiere of La belle H√©l√®ne).Harding J. Jacques Offenbach. John Calder, London, 1980. His archival work was extremely important in cataloguing the existing library, rescuing documents from destruction, and acquiring autograph documents and journals (sometimes at his own expense) for the collection. Acquisitions by Nuitter included an important collection of theatre books by Joseph de Filippi and around 900 opera librettos from a former director of the th√©√¢tre, Nestor Roqueplan. His influence on the expansion of the archive was impressive. In 1861, there were 350 volumes; by the end of 1862 there were 1,076, and in 1882 the collection had grown to 7,807. He ensured that their importance was taken into account when the Palais Garnier opened in 1875.

The district is a classified as a \\"Class C\\" school district consisting of 27 square miles which takes in portions of the city of Fenton, Fenton Township, parts of Grand Blanc, Linden and Mundy townships. History The district originally began as a collection of six one-room schoolhouses that consolidated in two waves. O'Dell Schoolhouse was designated as School District No. 1 and was located at the corner of Baldwin and Torrey roads in Fenton Township on land owned by Lafayette O'Dell and later donated by his descendant William O'Dell. The school was started in 1837, and was the first record school in the county. The first schoolhouse was built in 1845. At annexation, the school was the oldest district still in continuous operation. The first wave of consolidation was in 1922, and consisted of Severance, Long Lake and Sand Bar schools joined together. In 1953‚Äì54, the school district added the O'Dell, South Mundy and Kennedy one-room schools. Consolidation began in 1922 and, in 1956, the Lake Fenton Community School (essentially West Shore Elementary and Torrey Hill Middle School) was built to replace the one- room schools. The school itself sat on the site of one of the one-room schools, the former Long Lake School. Then, in 1959, the first Lake Fenton High School was built, being added onto the Community School. In time, West Shore and Torrey Hill moved to a new building in Lahring Road, and the high school occupied the 1956 school building. Today, Torrey Hill is an intermediate school, the original high school a middle school and a new high school that has been built on Lahring Road in Fenton Township. Karen Morris, 51, of Fenton Township, while serving as the Director of Food Services, embezzled approximately $100,000. The embezzlement occurred over the course of 2015 through 2019. In September 2019, she was allowed to plead to a misdemeanor from her felony charge of embezzlement. High school Athletics The Lake Fenton Blue Devils play in the Flint Metro League and compete in many sports including Basketball, Cheer (Competitive & Sideline), Football, Cross Country, Track, and, after adding Gymnastics and Lacrosse in 2015, Fenton offered opportunities for every Michigan High School Athletics Association (MHSAA) tournament sport.

History The first series of gloves were released in 1998 under the name \\"Academy.\\" In 2000 the company experienced rapid growth when it changed its name to Akadema, moved into the old Yoo-hoo factory in Garfield, NJ, and released the patented Reptilian Glove. Akadema signed Ozzie Smith as the company spokesman and then Anthony Telford and Clay Bellinger became the first Major League Players endorsing Akadema. Kris Totten (a former Minor League player for the Seattle Mariners joined the firm to head up sales. The company would follow up the Reptilian with the Claw, The Funnel and Spiral Lock, Tacktion Grip, The Hot Hands and the UFO Mitt to continue the companies first decade in creative sports design.

It belongs to the fungus moth family (Tineidae), and therein to the subfamily Nemapogoninae. It is widespread and common in much of western Eurasia, but seems to be absent from some more outlying regions, such as Portugal and the eastern Baltic, Ireland and Iceland. It has also not been recorded from Slovenia but given that it is found in neighboring countries, it may well occur there unnoticed. Recently, the species was recorded from British Columbia.Shared but overlooked: 30 species of Holarctic Microlepidoptera revealed by DNA barcodes and morphology Generally, it is a moth of warm temperate regions, e.g. in Great Britain it is only a rare and scarce species from the English Midlands northwards.FE (2009), Kimber [2010] The adults have a wingspan of 16‚Äì21 mm. They are generally nocturnal and can be attracted by light at night. They are on the wing in late spring to early summer, about May to July or starting somewhat earlier, depending on location. Their forewings are predominantly blackish, with irregular white mottling and speckling which results in a rough black zig-zag stripe running along the length of the wings. The forewing border is a hairy fringe colored with alternating black and white. The hindwings are uniformly pale dull grey and have a longer hairy fringe which is colored like the wings proper. The head has a tuft of orange-brown hairs. The caterpillars feed on bracket fungi, in particular Trametes and shiitake (Lentinula edodes), and also on the dead wood these fungi grow on.Grabe (1942), Kimber [2010] Synonyms Junior synonyms of T. parasitella are:Robinson [2010] * Tinea carpinetella Stainton, 1849 * Tinea griseolella Costa, 1836 * Tinea parasitella H√ºbner, 1796 * Triaxomera carpinetella (Stainton, 1849) * Triaxomera griseolella (Costa, 1836) Footnotes References * (2009): Triaxomera parasitella.

It belongs to the fungus moth family (Tineidae), and therein to the nominate subfamily Tineinae. It is widespread and common in much of western Eurasia, but seems to be absent from Portugal and the Balkans as well as the outlying islands (e.g. Iceland). The nocturnal adults are on the wing around May to September, depending on the location, and are easily attracted to light sources.FE (2009), Kimber [2010], and see references in Savela (2009) This smallish moth has a wingspan of when adult. They are more colorful than usual for the genus Tinea, though their colors usually fade considerably in dead specimens. The forewings are grey with a brownish tinge at the base, and rusty-red in the outer part. They have a black dot on the edge bordering the hindwings. The latter are a paler and purer grey. The body is dusky grey, but the head has a tuft of brick-red hair. The caterpillars feed on natural fibers, predominantly of animal origin, such as feathers, furs and wool; they have been found in bird nests and were recorded to eat rags and old clothes. But they are not notably synanthropic and generally eat only food that is outdoors; unlike the closely related case- bearing clothes moth (T. pellionella) the present species is rarely if at all recorded as a pest.Grabe (1942), Kimber [2010] Footnotes References * (1942): Eigenartige Geschmacksrichtungen bei Kleinschmetterlingsraupen [\\"Strange tastes among micromoth caterpillars\\"].

Hindley is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Hindley Prison opened in 1961 as a Borstal. In 1983 it was re-classified as a Youth Custody Centre. Hindley was then re-classified as an adult prison and in 1997 it became a joint prison and Young Offenders Institution. In 2015 Hindley was reclassified as a full adult jail for offenders over the age of 21. In 2002, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons recorded many good initiatives taking place at Hindley, particularly in suicide prevention, drugs strategy, sentence planning and joint work with the police service to monitor and act on racial incidents. However the Inspector criticised inadequate reception procedures, insufficient purposeful activity and patchy help with resettlement at the prison. In December 2004 a security alert was sparked when two inmates staged a roof-top protest at Hindley Prison. More than 100 extra staff were drafted in to deal with a riot at the prison on 5 October 2005. It took more than seven weeks to fully restore the prison wing after the riot which caused more than ¬£145,000 damage. The prison today The Youth Justice Board announced on 23 October 2014 that it will be withdrawing completely from Hindley. Hindley Prison is no longer a youth offender prison. It holds Category C male prisoners from the age of 18 upwards. Accommodation at the prison is made up of seven secure units, consisting of single and double cells. Hindley is a combined establishment with a regime that offers opportunities for inmates to gain qualifications, address offending behaviour, and reintegrate into society on their release. Regime provision includes learning and skills, as well as workshop places (which include construction skills) and physical education. Hindley also operates a listener and peer support scheme for those who may be at risk of suicide or self-harm. The prison's medical provision includes an in-patient healthcare facility and a mental health day care centre.

Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Australian Government.Tinea pellionella Linnaeus, 1758. Fauna Europaea. Version 2.4, 2011. Its scientific name is derived from \\"tinea\\", a generic term for micromoths, and the Latin term for a furrier, pellionellus. This species has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring nearly worldwide.Cheema, P. S. (1956). Studies on the bionomics of the case-bearing clothes moth, Tinea pellionella (L.) Bulletin of Entomological Research 47(1), 167-82. It is synanthropic; the adult is typically encountered during summer and early autumn, but populations that live in human dwellings may be seen at other times of the year.Kimber, I. Case-bearing Clothes Moth, Tinea pellionella. UKMoths. 2013. Tinea pellionella is silvery grey to shiny light brown in color, with dark grayish hairs on the top of its head. The adult of this species has a wingspan of 9 to 16 millimeters. Its forewings are grizzled brown with one large spot and a few smaller, indistinct black spots. The hindwings are plain pale brown-grey. The forewings, but especially the hindwings are surrounded by a hairy fringe. The larva eats mainly fibrous keratin, such as hairs and feathers. It can become a pest when it feeds on carpets, furs, upholstery, and woolen fabrics. It also consumes detritus, cobwebs, bird nests (particularly of the domestic pigeon), stored vegetable produce and wallpaper. It stays inside a snug case it constructs from debris such as fibers and hairs.Grabe, A. (1942). Eigenartige Geschmacksrichtungen bei Kleinschmetterlingsraupen (\\"Strange tastes among micromoth caterpillars\\"). Zeitschrift des Wiener Entomologen-Vereins 27: 105-09. (in German) Control measures for the case-bearing clothes moth are similar to those for the common clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella), and include physical, chemical, and biological measures. Being a widespread species and often affiliated with humans, T. pellionella was among the first moths to be scientifically described in the modern sense. At that time most moths were included in a single genus \\"Phalaena\\", but Tinea was already recognized as a distinct subgenus. Some later researchers who studied this moth erroneously believed they had discovered populations formerly unknown to science and described them as new species, but today these are all included within T. pellionella. Obsolete scientific names for this moth thus may be encountered in the literature, and include:Tinea pellionella. Global Taxonomic Database of Tineidae (Lepidoptera).

In 1913 he became a founder and the first director of the Odessa Conservatory, which gave the world a number of outstanding musicians, such as David Oistrakh, Emil Gilels and Yakov Zak. After the Russian revolution, because of the imminent threat of Bolshevik persecution, Maliszewski immigrated to Poland in 1921. In 1925‚Äì1927 he was teaching at the Chopin Music School and was the Director of the Warsaw Music Society. In 1927 he served as Chairman of the First International Frederic Chopin Piano Competition.

He served in the Tokugawa shogunate in the positions of R≈çj≈´ and Wakadoshiyori, and became a leader in the Meiji government following the Meiji Restoration as a politician. He was one of the founders of the Japanese Red Cross. He is also known as . Biography Matsudaira was born in Okudono as the eldest son and heir to Matsudaira Noritoshi. His father retired in March 1852. The following year, with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry and his fleet, the Shogunate increased military preparations against possible foreign invasion. Matsudaira was appointed Second Assistant Director to the Shogunal military, a largely ceremonial position, but one which enabled him to train the peasants of his domain into a rudimentary military force along western lines. In 1860, he was appointed master of ceremonies for the annual pilgrimage to the grave of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Nikk≈ç. In 1863, he became obangashira, and rose to the ranks of the wakadoshiyori later that year. Towards the end of the year, he shifted the seat of his domain from Okudono to Tanoguchi. (Okudono domain was unusual in that it consisted of several small territories that were widely separated geographically). As Matsudaira was a proponent of western-style modernization of the military, he had his new castle built in the style of a western-style five-pointed star fort; this became Tatsuoka Castle. The domain was also called \\"Tatsuoka-han\\", after the location of the castle. Along with the Gory≈çkaku in Hakodate, Hokkaido, it is one of only two star forts in Japan. Matsudaira disagreed with Matsudaira Yoshinaga with regards to the question of ending the sakoku national isolation policy and was expelled from the ranks of the wakadoshiyori, but was recalled for his military expertise the following year, and reinstated. He further rose to the ranks of the r≈çju in June 1866, which enabled him to participate in negotiations between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Imperial Court later that year. He also encouraged the Shogunate to hire French military advisors to help modernize its forces, and to expand on his concept of a peasant conscript army to supplement the traditional forces of the samurai warriors, along with taking steps to increase industrialization to increase Japan‚Äôs economic strength. However, before any of the steps to could take effect, the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration began. Despite his nominal rank as a general of the Tokugawa armies, Matsudaira refused to take up arms against the Imperial armies and retired to his domain in Shinano to await the outcome. Arrested as a central figure in the Tokugawa government by Satch≈ç Alliance leaders, Matsudaira was given a chance to prove his loyalty by leading a military force against the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei in northern Japan. After having accomplished this task, he was allowed to retain his position as daimy≈ç of Tanoguchi. Matsudaira changed his name officially in July 1869, dropping the Matsudaira name due to its associations with the Tokugawa clan and reverting to his family‚Äôs former name of Ogyu. In 1871, with the abolition of the han system, Ogyu was confirmed as appointed governor of Tanoguchi, until it was merged into the new Nagano Prefecture. In 1873, he entered the Meiji government, and was assigned the task of researching the medals and decorations issued by foreign governments, and developing an award system which would be suitable for Japan. In 1884, under the new kazoku peerage system, he was elevated to the rank of viscount (shishaku). The title was further raised to that of count (hakushaku) in 1907. He was also active with Sano Tsunetani in the founding of the Hakuaisha, the predecessor of the Japanese Red Cross.Nishikawa, Japan's Changing Role in Humanitarian Crises. page 50 In 1909, he was asked to become a member of the Privy Council.

The hindwings are a silvery white; they are surrounded by a long-haired fringe, as usual for fungus moths and relatives. The body is dull brown, and the head bears a tuft of reddish-brown hair.Kimber [2010] The caterpillars feed on dry animal and plant remains. Despite the species' common name, they are rarely recorded as a pest of clothing. Though they will eat discarded wool and similar fabrics, they are more commonly found in bird nests - particularly of chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), swallows (Hirundinidae) and woodpeckers (Picidae) -, where they feed on shed feathers and feces.

It is the second-outermost of the Madrid orbital highways, the M-30 being the closest to the centre of Madrid. Overview It has a total length of , looping around Madrid and its suburb Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n at a mean distance of to the Puerta del Sol. The actual distance is much closer in the southern and eastern spans, which have been engulfed by the city in some points; than in the west, where the Casa de Campo and the projection towards Pozuelo brings it further from Madrid itself. Furthermore, it is the only one of the several ring roads serving Madrid that runs as a full-fledged motorway for all its length: a span about long at the northern arc of the inner M-30 are not freeway-grade, having level crossings and traffic lights; while the outermost M-50 is not a full ring road due to the interruption caused by the Mount of El Pardo protected natural zone. With the \\"normal\\" M-40 traffic already being one of the heaviest in Spain, this provides for mighty jams in its northern span during peak hours. The Madrid regional government, which built the M-45 motorway external to the M-40 specifically to decongest the southern and eastern spans of the older beltway, has recently aired plans to address the northern jams by effectively \\"closing\\" the M-50 ring with a tunnel under the protected area. Somewhat counterintuitively to foreigners and natives alike, the M in the road name does not indicate a hypothetical ownership of the road by the autonomous regional administration. Instead, both the M-40 and the M-50 are state-owned freeways, as shown by the white text on blue background of their signals, whereas Madrid regional motorways like the M-45 use black text on an orange background that identify them as pertaining to the \\"regional first order roads\\" category of the Spanish Traffic Code. The M-30, on the other hand, is managed by the Madrid City Council as an urban freeway.

More frequent use and discussion of the term \\"VUCA\\" began from 2002 and derives from this acronym from military education. It has subsequently taken root in emerging ideas in strategic leadership that apply in a wide range of organizations, from for-profit corporations to education Alt URL Meaning The deeper meaning of each element of VUCA serves to enhance the strategic significance of VUCA foresight and insight as well as the behaviour of groups and individuals in organizations. It discusses systemic failures and behavioural failures, which are characteristic of organisational failure. * V = Volatility: the nature and dynamics of change, and the nature and speed of change forces and change catalysts. * U = Uncertainty: the lack of predictability, the prospects for surprise, and the sense of awareness and understanding of issues and events. * C = Complexity: the multiplex of forces, the confounding of issues, no cause- and-effect chain and confusion that surrounds organization. * A = Ambiguity: the haziness of reality, the potential for misreads, and the mixed meanings of conditions; cause-and-effect confusion. These elements present the context in which organizations view their current and future state. They present boundaries for planning and policy management. They come together in ways that either confound decisions or sharpen the capacity to look ahead, plan ahead and move ahead. VUCA sets the stage for managing and leading. The particular meaning and relevance of VUCA often relates to how people view the conditions under which they make decisions, plan forward, manage risks, foster change and solve problems. In general, the premises of VUCA tend to shape an organization's capacity to: #Anticipate the Issues that Shape #Understand the Consequences of Issues and Actions #Appreciate the Interdependence of Variables #Prepare for Alternative Realities and Challenges #Interpret and Address Relevant Opportunities For most contemporary organizations ‚Äì business, the military, education, government and others ‚Äì VUCA is a practical code for awareness and readiness. Beyond the simple acronym is a body of knowledge that deals with learning models for VUCA preparedness, anticipation, evolution and intervention. Themes Failure in itself may not be a catastrophe, but failure to learn from failure definitely is. It is not enough to train leaders in core competencies without identifying the key factors that inhibit their using the resilience and adaptability that are vital in order to distinguish potential leaders from mediocre managers. Anticipating change as a result of VUCA is one outcome of resilient leadership. The capacity of individuals and organizations to deal with VUCA can be measured with a number of engagement themes: #Knowledge Management and Sense-Making #Planning and Readiness Considerations #Process Management and Resource Systems #Functional Responsiveness and Impact Models #Recovery Systems and Forward Practices #Systemic failures #Behavioural failures At some level, the capacity for VUCA management and leadership hinges on enterprise value systems, assumptions and natural goals. A \\"prepared and resolved\\" enterprise is engaged with a strategic agenda that is aware of and empowered by VUCA forces. The capacity for VUCA leadership in strategic and operating terms depends on a well- developed mindset for gauging the technical, social, political, market and economic realities of the environment in which people work. Working with deeper smarts about the elements of VUCA may be a driver for survival and sustainability in an otherwise complicated world. Psychometrics which measure fluid intelligence by tracking information processing when faced with unfamiliar, dynamic and vague data can predict cognitive performance in VUCA environments = Social Categorization =  Volatility  Volatility is the \\"V\\" component of VUCA. This refers to the different situational social- categorization of people due to specific traits or reactions that stand out during that particular situation. When people react/act based on a specific situation, there is a possibility that the public categorizes them into a different group than they were in a previous situation. These people might respond differently to individual situations due to social or environmental cues. The idea that situational occurrences cause certain social categorization is known as volatility and is one of the main aspects of the self-categorization theory. Sociologists use volatility to understand better how stereotypes and social-categorization is impacted based on the situation at hand as well as any outside forces that may lead people to perceive others differently. Volatility is the changing dynamic of social-categorization in a set of environmental situations. The dynamic can change due to any shift in a situation, whether it is social, technical, biological or anything of the like. Studies have been conducted, but it has proven difficult to find the specific component that causes the change in situational social- categorization. There are two separate components that connect people to social identities. The first social cue is normative fit. This describes the degree that a person relates to the stereotypes and norms that others associate with their specific identity. For example, when a Hispanic woman is cleaning the house, most of the time, people connect gender stereotypes with this situation, while her ethnicity is not concerned, but when this same woman eats an enchilada, ethnicity stereotypes surface while her gender is not concerned. The second social cue is comparative fit. This is when a specific characteristic or trait of a person is prominent in certain situations when compared to other people. For example, as mentioned by Bodenhausen and Peery, when there is one woman in a room full of men. She sticks out because she is the only one of her gender compared to many others of the opposite gender. However, all of the men are clumped together because they do not have any specific traits that stands out among the rest of them. Comparative fit shows that people categorize others based on the comparative social context. In a certain situation, specific characteristics are made obvious due to the fact that others around that individual do not possess that characteristic. However, in other situations, this characteristic may be the norm and would not be a key characteristic in the categorization process. People can also be less criticizing of the same person during different situations. For example, when looking at an African American man on the street of a low-income neighborhood and when looking at the same man inside a school of a high-income neighborhood, people will be less judgmental when seeing him in the school. Nothing else has changed about this man, other than his location. When individuals are spotted in certain social contexts, the basic-level categories are forgotten and the more partial categories are brought to light. This really helps to describe the problems of situational social-categorization and how stereotypes can shift the perspectives of those around an individual.  Uncertainty  Uncertainty in the VUCA framework is almost just as it sounds: when the availability or predictability of information in events is unknown. Uncertainty often occurs in volatile environments that are complex in structure involving unanticipated interactions that are significant in uncertainty. Uncertainty may occur in the intention to imply causation or correlation between the events of a social perceiver and a target. Situations where there is either a lack of information to prove why a perception is in occurrence or informational availability but lack of causation are where uncertainty is salient. The uncertainty component of the framework serves as a grey area and is compensated by the use of social categorization and/or stereotypes. Social categorization can be described as a collection of people that have no interaction but tend to share similar characteristics with one another. People have a tendency to engage in social categorization, especially when there is a lack of information surrounding the event. Literature suggests that there are default categories that tend to be assumed in the absence of any clear data when referring to someone's gender or race in the essence of a discussion. Often individuals associate the use of general references (e.g. people, they, them, a group) with the male gender, meaning people = male. This instance often occurs when there is not enough information to clearly distinguish someone's gender. For example, when discussing a written piece of information most people will assume the author is a male. If an author's name is not available (lack of information) it is difficult to determine the gender of the author through the context of whatever was written. People will automatically label the author as a male without having any prior basis of gender, placing the author in a social category. This social categorization happens in this example, but people will also assume someone is a male if the gender is not known in many other situations as well. Social categorization occurs in the realm of not only gender but also race. Default assumptions can be made, like in gender, to the race of an individual or a group of people based on prior known stereotypes. For example, race-occupation combinations such as a basketball player or a golf player will receive race assumptions. Without any information of the individual's race, a basketball player will be assumed to be black and a golf player will be assumed to be white. This is based upon stereotypes because of the majority of race in each sport tend to be dominated by a single race, but in reality, there are other races within each sport.  Complexity  Complexity is the ‚ÄúC‚Äù component of VUCA, that refers to the interconnectivity and interdependence of multiple components in a system. When conducting research, complexity is a component that scholars have to keep in mind. The results of a deliberately controlled environment are unexpected because of the non-linear interaction and interdependencies within different groups and categories. In a sociological aspect, the VUCA framework is utilized in research to understand social perception in the real world and how that plays into social categorization as well as stereotypes. Galen V Bodenhausen and Destiny Peery's article Social Categorization and Stereotyping In vivo: The VUCA Challenge, focused on researching how social categories impacted the process of social cognition and perception. The strategy used to conduct the research is to manipulate or isolate a single identity of a target while keeping all other identities constant. This method creates clear results of how a specific identity in a social category can change one's perception of other identities, thus creating stereotypes. There are problems with categorizing an individual's social identity due to the complexity of an individual's background. This research fails to address the complexity of the real-world and the results from this highlighted an even great picture about social categorization and stereotyping. Complexity adds many layers of different components to an individual's identity and creates challenges for sociologists trying to examine social categories. In the real world, people are far more complex compared to a modified social environment. Individuals identify with more than one social category, which opens the door to a deeper discovery about stereotyping. Results from research conducted by Bodenhausen reveals that there are certain identities that are more dominant than others. Perceivers who recognize these specific identities latch on to it and associate their preconceived notion of such identity and make initial assumptions about the individuals and hence stereotypes are created. On the other hand, perceivers who share some of the identities with the target become more open-minded. They also take into consideration more than one social identity at the same time and this is also known as cross-categorization effects. Some social categories are embedded in a larger categorical structure, which makes that subcategory even more crucial and outstanding to perceivers. Research on cross-categorization reveals that different types of categories can be activated in the mind of the social perceiver, which causes both positive and negative effects. A positive outcome is that perceivers are more open-minded despite other social stereotypes. They have more motivation to think deeply about the target and see past the most dominant social category. Bodenhausen also acknowledges that cross-categorization effects lead to social invisibility. Some types of cross-over identities may lessen the noticeability of other identities, which may cause targets to be subjected to ‚Äúintersectional invisibility,‚Äù where neither social identities have a distinct component and are overlooked.  Ambiguity  Ambiguity is the ‚ÄúA‚Äù component of VUCA. This refers to when the general meaning of something is unclear even when an appropriate amount of information is provided. Many get confused about the meaning of ambiguity. It is similar to the idea of uncertainty but they have different factors. Uncertainty is when relevant information is unavailable and unknown, and ambiguity where relevant information is available but the overall meaning is still unknown. Both uncertainty and ambiguity exist in our culture today. Sociologists use ambiguity to determine how and why an answer has been developed. Sociologists focus on details such as if there was enough information present, and did the subject have the full amount of knowledge necessary to make a decision. and why did he/she come to their specific answer. Ambiguity leads to people assuming an answer, and many times this leads assuming ones race, gender, and can even lead to class stereotypes. If a person has some information but still doesn't have the overall answer, the person starts to assume his/her own answer based on the relevant information he/she already possesses. For example, as mentioned by Bodenhausen we may occasionally encounter people who are sufficiently androgynous to make it difficult to ascertain their gender, and at least one study suggests that with brief exposure, androgynous individuals can sometimes be miscategorized on the basis of gender-atypical features (very long hair, for a man, or very short hair, for a woman. Overall, ambiguity leads to the categorization of many. For example, it may lead to assuming ones sexual orientation. Unless a person is open about their own sexual orientation, people will automatically assume that they are heterosexual. But if a man possesses feminine qualities or a female possesses masculine qualities then they might be portrayed as either gay or lesbian. Ambiguity leads to the categorization of people without further important details that could lead to untrue conclusions. Sociologists believe that ambiguity can lead to race stereotypes and discrimination. In a study done in South Africa by three sociologists, they had white citizens of South Africa look at pictures of racially mixed faces and they had to decide whether these faces were European or African. Because these test subjects were all white they had a hard problem defining these mixed race faces as European and deemed them all to be African. The reason they did this is because of ambiguity. The information that was available was the skin tone of the people in the pictures and the facial qualities they possessed, with this information the test subjects had all of that information available but still did not know the answer for sure. They overall assumed because they did not look exactly like them, then they could not be European.

The homes were fairly easy to finance, the kits supplied all or nearly all of the supplies needed to build the home and they mimicked nearly every popular style. One significant advantage of the catalog homes was the ease with which they could be added onto. If the house was built between 1900 and 1940 and bears a resemblance to a particular style, but has differences, it still may be a catalog home.

She has received considerable criticism over these claims. Career Morgan claims to have had a psychic experience at the age of nine months, and has said she saw her first ghost when she was aged four years. As an adult she became a professional medium. Morgan has appeared on the ITV2 programme Sally Morgan: Star Psychic, Sky Bio channel programme The Psychic Life of Sally Morgan, as well as several series of the Sky Living programme Psychic Sally: On the Road. The series has also been released on DVD, along with Psychic Sally's Big Fat Operation, which was also broadcast on the Living Channel. During a show in Dublin, Ireland, in September 2011, Morgan was accused of receiving information about her audience members from an off-stage confederate, which she then repeated in her \\"psychic readings\\". Following a show at the Grand Canal Theatre, several callers to radio network RT√â reported that they had overheard a male voice relaying information to Morgan from the control room at the rear of the theatre. A caller said, \\"The first half of the show went really well but when the second half started, we could clearly hear a man's voice coming from the window behind us. Everything he said, the psychic would say 10 seconds later. It was as if she was having the information relayed to her. On her website, Morgan responded to The Guardian report by denying the involvement of all Grand Canal Theatre employees and stating that her head microphone was a one-way device. The Daily Mail was later forced to pay ¬£125,000 in damages after accepting that the earpiece claim was \\"untrue\\". At a public show on 23 February 2012 Morgan gave a reading to two members of the audience, Drew McAdam and his wife Elizabeth. The reading described a man called Toby who had died in an explosion. However, prior to the show, Drew and his wife say they fed Morgan this information by emailing her website and leaving notes in a box provided in the foyer for so- called \\"love-letters\\". McAdam's description of the death of \\"Toby\\" was taken from a fictional character who died in an explosion in the 1970s BBC drama, Doomwatch. Morgan performed a psychic reading for Big Brother winner Brian Dowling on ITV2 in 2007. Asked on camera whether she knew him, she said \\"well, I know of him\\". She had actually given a similar reading for him in 2005. She later claimed that her original response was made \\"because the director told me to\\". In March 2014, Morgan became embarrassed during a performance after contacting the spirit of a woman who was still alive in the audience. The woman had mistakenly given Morgan a photo of herself instead of a photo of a dead loved one. Morgan then proceeded to contact and communicate with the spirit of the woman, and when the truth became known, the audience erupted in laughter and Morgan was unable to recover the performance. On 16 August 2018, Morgan entered the Celebrity Big Brother House, where she finished in 5th place. In early 2020 her 10th anniversary UK tour was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.https://sallymorgan.tv/tour-dates/ Criticism Morgan has been criticised on multiple occasions for claiming she has psychic abilities, and has been accused of being a fraud. The Merseyside Skeptics Society and Simon Singh promoted a test of Morgan's psychic abilities, set for 31 October 2011. Morgan declined to attend, with an email to Singh from Morgan's lawyers stating \\"You well know that we all have far more important things to do than take part in this or any other 'test' at this point. She will not attend at Liverpool or at any other time.\\" Members of the public called a radio station claiming to have heard Morgan appearing to repeat back information that they said moments earlier they'd overheard coming from the theatre lighting box during one of Morgan's shows at The Grand Canal Theatre in Dublin. Citing \\"substantial damage to her reputation, as well as hurt, distress and embarrassment\\", Morgan sued Associated Newspapers for ¬£150,000 over magician Paul Zenon's 22 September 2011 article in the Daily Mail about these public claims. JREF President, D.J. Grothe, writing for The Huffington Post questioned why Morgan would sue for ¬£150,000 when she could prove her ability by winning JREF's \\"Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge\\". \\"It makes one wonder if even Sally Morgan believes that Sally Morgan's powers are real.\\" Legal issues In October 2014, Morgan had used legal threats, while her husband and son-in-law had used homophobic slurs and verbal intimidation, in a confrontation with sceptical activist Mark Tilbrook. Tilbrook had been in the vicinity of many stage psychic shows handing out leaflets entitled \\"Look After Yourself\\", advising audience members of clues that might distinguish between a person with genuine supernatural powers and someone who \\"just appears to have them\\".

As the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew, former enemies and Minnesotans Rain and Lacey teamed up as a tag team in 2003. English wrestler Jetta was later welcomed into the group. Lacey soon retired from professional wrestling and the International Home Wrecking Crew became a tag team, but in May 2009 Lacey reappeared in a managerial capacity for the team. Their last match was in November 2009, after which time Rain mainly wrestled in Mexico and Jetta retired. Their name is an homage to the Minnesota Wrecking Crew. History =Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew= IWA: Mid-South (2002‚Äì2004) Lacey and Rain, both of Minnesota extraction, spent most of 2002 feuding with each other in Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA: Mid-South) as well as Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), Minnesota Independent Wrestling and others. However, by the end of 2003, at IWA: Mid-South's Stylin' and Profilin' the duo found themselves teaming together, in a losing effort, to Daizee Haze and Mickie Knuckles and again the following year at You Gotta See This picking up a return victory. Women's Erotic Wrestling (2006‚Äì2007) As well as making individual appearances for the company, the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew have wrestled twice for Women's Erotic Wrestling. In July 2006 the duo defeated the team of Shantelle Taylor and Pussy Willow at Nude and Nasty. The following year, at May's Nude War Games, the two challenged Annie Social and Sumie Sakai for the WEW Tag Team Championship but failed to win gold. Shimmer Women Athletes (2006‚Äì2008) After continuing to wrestle as singles wrestlers, the two found themselves individually employed by Illinois-based start-up promotion Shimmer Women Athletes from its beginning in 2005. It was not until Volume 5 that the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew made their presence known, with Lacey confronting Mercedes Martinez for focusing too much on Sara Del Rey and goading her into a tag team match. Martinez actually picked Del Rey as her partner but Lacey's boasting was justified as the Home Wreckers picked up their maiden Shimmer win after Del Rey accidentally hit Martinez with a running boot while aiming for Lacey. During Volume 7 Rain, with Lacey in her corner, found herself wrestling MsChif who was embroiled in a feud with Cheerleader Melissa. When Melissa came to the ringside to attack MsChif she was shoved to the floor by Lacey eventually leading to Rain's loss by disqualification. In return, the two attacked Melissa in her main event match but, in a moment that saw enemies become allies, MsChif ran out to save Melissa and beat down the two, leading to Lacey challenging the two to a tag team match. Once again, on Volume 8, the Home Wreckers proved that teamwork prevails over ad hoc teaming when the two performed a Double Team Tomikaze on MsChif before pinning her to win their second match. Over the course of Volume 11 and Volume 12, Shimmer held a knock out tournament to crown the inaugural Shimmer Champion. Rain was knocked out in the first round by Nikki Roxx but Lacey found greater success, finding herself in the final against Del Rey. As the match was ending, Lacey knocked the referee over allowing Rain to enter the ring and use her Rain Drop finisher on Del Rey. A returning Roxx and Shimmer founder Allison Danger came to the ringside to carry off Rain, making sure the match stayed even leading to Del Rey picking up the title. This led to the main event of Volume 13 where the Home Wreckers faced their tournament foes Del Rey and Roxx who competently defeated the tag team; Del Rey had both in her Royal Butterfly simultaneously from where Nikki Roxx used her Barbie Crusher on Lacey while Rain received a powerslam from Del Rey and was pinned, marking their first Shimmer tag team loss. After the team became international (see below) The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew made two more appearances in their original form. Their final appearance in Shimmer was at Volume 18 in April 2008. In what was deemed an upset victory, the team lost to losing to Ashley Lane and Nevaeh, giving the team their first victory in the promotion since joining the company the volume before. This was also Lacey's last match as an active competitor, as she retired from in-ring action and disappeared entirely from wrestling until ROH's Rising Above in November before returning as manager of the International Home Wrecking Crew the following year. Ring of Honor (2007‚Äì2008) The tag team made their first appearance in Ring of Honor at The Battle of St Paul in April 2007 as event openers, with Jimmy Jacobs in their corner defeating the Dangerous Angels (Allison Danger and Sara Del Rey). Two months later they appeared at Driven further up the card. They presaged their first International Home Wreckers outing by competing with MsChif and Daizee Haze. Unlike their later Shimmer encounter, the duo managed to score a victory. As Lacey was already a member of Jacobs' The Age of the Fall stable, an invitation was extended to Rain who joined the group and the duo made several appearances, together and apart, for the faction such as at Supercard of Honor III where they held down Jay Briscoe forcing his brother, Mark, to submit. Full Impact Pro Wrestling (2007‚Äì2008) After their appearance in ROH, the Home Wreckers were challenged by the Dangerous Angels to a rematch at Hot Summer Nights in June 2007. Joined by Amazing Kong and also facing their other enemy Daizee Haze, the three were victorious. Their winning streak outside of Shimmer came to an abrupt end at Cage of Pain II in September when the combined team of Haze and Del Rey defeated them. Danger remained winless over the team, however, as they successfully wrestled their final FIP match against her and Trenesha. By this point, February 2008, the Minnesota Home Wreckers had become part of the larger FIP group Young, Rich and Ready for action (The YRR) and it was their influence the match before, helping Chasyn Rance defeat Seth Delay, that made Danger call demand a match against the pair. After this match Jacobs invited Rain to join Lacey in The Age Of The Fall, which she accepted. =International Home Wrecking Crew (2007‚Äìcurrent)= The Home Wreckers were awarded, then stripped of, the Shimmer Tag Team Championship In October at Shimmer's Volume 16, the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew were booked in a tag team match against MsChif, Daizee Haze and 'The Jezebel' Eden Black. In an interview during the evening, the Home Wreckers revealed that they had selected their partner in the form of English native Jetta who had a career long feud with Black, and had faced MsChif and Haze in England. They referred to her as the \\"cream of their Oreo\\" but initially the mix failed to work as Jetta was pinned after 25 minutes, losing the match. The team later announced themselves as the International Home Wrecking Crew and returned at Volume 17 when Rain and Jetta defeated Danyah and Jennifer Blake. Later in that evening the original Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew appeared under their original name but were defeated by Ashley Lane and Neveah. After Lacey retired, the International Home Wreckers became a twosome and they gained a return victory over Ashley Lane and Neveah through unsporting means, as Rain grabbed hold of Neveah's tights. At Volume 21, Shimmer Women Athletes extended their gold to include tag team champions and crowned the inaugural victors in a six team gauntlet match. The Home Wreckers entered fourth and eliminated the Suicide Blondes (LuFisto) and Jennifer Blake) but once again found themselves suffering defeat at the hands of Ashley Lane and Neveah, who eventually won. Owing to the long history between the two teams in both their forms, Volume 23 was promoted with a two out of three falls tag team match between the two for the gold. The match was mired in controversy as, in their typically comic fashion the team wore masks to the ring to protect themselves from swine flu before being joined by a returning Lacey who had not been seen since the previous year and was thought retired. She reversed a pinfall while the referee was distracted allowing her team to pick up the first fall and then, when the referee attempted to eject her from ringside she displayed her official manager's license. Lacey caused the second fall to go against the team as Jetta checked on her after she was knocked off the apron, leaving Rain to be double teamed and pinned. Lacey was fundamental in the third pin as she handed Jetta a chain to use, giving her the second and decisive fall for her team. However, as the team celebrated with their newly found gold, a backstage official came to the ring and demanded the match be restarted owing to the underhanded tactics of the team and Ashley Lane and Neveah instantly pulled out their double team move and won. The team bounced back with a win over Ariel and Nikki Roxx on Volume 24. The team defeated Rachel Summerlyn and Daffney on Volume 27 after the evil Daffney abandoned Rachel during the match, and their last victory in SHIMMER came against the duo of Jessie McKay and Tenille on Volume 28.

Four prison officers were injured at the premises during the disturbance. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons assessment of the prison in June 2011 was that it was fundamentally safe, but work was required to reduce levels of violence and improve discipline. It was noted that the prison had a \\"challenging population\\", but staff had worked hard to make improvements since 2007.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-15633670 The prison was inspected again in 2015.

Inslee faced Republican candidate Joe Marine, a former Mukilteo City Councilman and State Representative. Though Marine gave Inslee one of the closest races of his career, the Congressman was successful on election day and bested Marine by a fourteen point margin. District 2 thumb Freshman Democratic Congressman Rick Larsen, who represents this northwestern Washington-based district, ran for re-election. Larsen faced Republican Norma Smith, an aide to former Congressman Jack Metcalf and a former South Whidbey school board member in the general election. Though Larsen attained a majority of the vote and retained his seat, Smith was able to keep her Democratic opponent to only a five point margin, surprisingly close in this marginally liberal district. District 3 thumb Though the southwestern Washington-based district that two-term Democratic incumbent Congressman Brian Baird represents is essentially a centrist district, the Congressman was able to perform surprisingly well against Republican State Senator Joseph Zarelli. Baird was overwhelmingly re-elected over Zarelli, receiving over sixty percent of the vote on election day. District 4 thumb In this solidly conservative, central Washington congressional district, incumbent Republican Congressman Doc Hastings faced Democrat Craig Mason, a sociology professor at Columbia Basin College in the general election. Owing to Congressman Hastings‚Äôs popularity and his district‚Äôs strong proclivity towards electing Republican candidates, the Congressman was re-elected in a landslide. District 5 thumb Running for his fifth term in Congress, incumbent Republican Congressman George Nethercutt faced Democratic candidate Bart Haggin and Libertarian candidate Rob Chase as obstacles to another term. In this staunchly conservative district rooted in the socially conservative counties of eastern Washington, Congressman Nethercutt hardly faced a challenge and easily won another term. District 6 thumb Long-serving Democratic Congressman Norm Dicks, the longest-serving of Washington congressmen, has represented this liberal-leaning, Kitsap Peninsula-based district since he was first elected in United States House of Representatives elections, 1980#Washington. Congressman Dicks faced Republican nominee Bob Lawrence in the general election, who was also his opponent in the previous two elections. Lawrence hardly faced a chance in the general election, and Dicks was swept into his fourteenth term in a landslide. District 7 thumb This district, the most liberal in Washington, encompasses most of the city of Seattle and has been represented by Democratic Congressman Jim McDermott since he was first elected in 1988. Running for a seventh term this year, McDermott faced off against Republican Carol Cassady and Libertarian Stan Lippman, whom he crushed in the general election by a convincing margin. District 8 thumb Incumbent Republican Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn ran for a seventh term in this liberal-leaning district and faced Democratic nominee Heidi Behrens- Benedict and Libertarian Mark Taff in the general election. Though this district, based in the eastern suburbs of Seattle, has a tendency to vote Democratic, the potential potency of Behrens-Benedict‚Äôs candidacy was hampered by the fact that she has achieved perennial status, running for the same seat two previous times. Ultimately, Congresswoman Dunn was re-elected by a solid margin on election day. District 9 thumb In his bid for a fourth term, incumbent Democratic Congressman Adam Smith was opposed by Republican State Representative Sarah Casada and Libertarian candidate J. Mills in the general election. Congressman Smith represents a liberal-leaning district that runs from the state‚Äôs capital of Olympia to some of the southern suburbs of Seattle, and, true to the liberal tendencies of his constituency, Smith was re-elected by a substantial margin over Casada and Mills.

Regular Passendale cheese is produced in two versions, Classic and Prelude.Belgische kazen (Belgian cheeses) (Dutch/French) There is also a premium version, Passendale Bel Age. Passendale Cheese resembles a loaf of bread, with a round shape, and a hard but edible brown rind with spots of white. Inside, the flesh is golden, dotted with small holes and very creamy. It has a firm and damp consistency, slightly sweet bouquet and mild flavor. History The Donck family of Passendale started producing cheeses in 1932 with the cooperation of many of the area's milk producers. After World War II, the family began producing milk, butter and yoghurt as well, and eventually relocated their business to a former brewery. In 1978, they launched \\"de Groot Hof‚ÄìGrand‚ÄôFerme\\", a cheese inspired by local tradition. In 1980, it was renamed Passendale for export purposes.

The lead arranger assigns parts of the new issue to other underwriters for placement and usually takes the largest part itself. It is also called a managing underwriter or a syndicate manager. The arranger is paid either through an arranger fee, through skimming or through structuring fees. In Europe the term most used is the mandated lead arranger, they generally have the leading role in the financing stage of a project. The arranger often underwrites the financing, then handles syndication or builds up a group to underwrite the full amount and syndicate. As a requirement of its mandate from the project sponsor, the MLA will be committed to raise the complete debt financing, which for a major project could be many hundreds of millions of dollars. But, commercial lenders typically do not want to take more than a small part of the debt for a particular project and will want to pass some of the debt, and hence some of the risk, to other lenders. The process of selling the debt is called syndication. In large deals with multiple tranches, there may be an arranger for all, or there may be a separate arranger for each tranche. During the syndication process one of the banks may fulfil the role of book runner. This role of the book runner is simply to keep a record of how much debt each of the potential syndication banks wants to take.

The Kings of Denmark laid a claim on Estonia as their possession, which was recognised by the pope. In 1219 the Danish fleet landed in the major harbor of Estonia and defeated the Estonians in the Battle of Lindanise that brought Northern Estonia under Danish reign until the Estonian uprising in 1343, when the territories were taken over by the Teutonic Order and sold by Denmark in 1346. =Modern Estonia= Denmark recognised Estonia's independence in 1921. On 18 December 1926, both counties established a conciliation commission. On 13 May 1930, an agreement on reciprocity was signed.

Parts can be built on a ZPrinter at a rate of approximately 1 vertical inch per hour. Color printing Zprinters can print parts in full color, using inkjet technology that has been refined for decades in the 2 dimensional printing industry. The color science has been adapted for use in 3 dimensions. The color spectrum of their most capable machines is full cmyk, or up to 6 million colors. Due to this wide range of color choices, the machines are able to print gradient color patterns. This is how the machines differ from any other \\"color\\" 3d printing system. Color can be used to simulate the appearance of other materials (as in architectural models or product prototypes Building Design Experience Building OnlineCivil Engineering News), to highlight surface structures or add annotations to models (as in models used to plan surgeries The Journal of Cranialfacial Surgery), or to display the results of structural analyses (such as finite element analysis) directly on the model surface. Zprinters originally gained recognition through applications in medical and architectural industry. More recently, they have been popular for creating 3d printed models of people from color 3d-scans, avatars from video games (Space Engineers, World of Warcraft, Assassin's Creed), artistic and realistic sculptures. As of 2016, 3D Systems rebranded the Z Corp's 3D printing technology as Color Jet. Quickparts.com, the service bureau owned by 3D Systems, offers service from this printing technology.  Printer modifications  In 2018, Scott Ziv modified a Z Corp Z402 (the first commercially available machine to use binder jetting) to use selective laser sintering to create 3D objects by fusing glitter.

(Spring/Summer 2008). \\"Meta-Leadership: Expanding the scope and scale of public health\\". Leadership in Public Health, 8 (1&2) starting with the September 11 attacks in the U.S.The focus on national preparedness has subsequently been distilled for more general application, though it remains useful to crisis leaders particularly given current and persistent natural and man-made threats requiring the coordination of multiple agencies and organizations in preparation, response, and recovery. Meta-leadership re- frames the practice of leadership by providing: 1) A comprehensive organizing framework for understanding and integrating the many facets of leadership; 2) A method for catalyzing collaborative activity; 3) A focus on improving function and performance across organizational and sector boundaries.  Origins  The framework was developed by Leonard J. Marcus and Barry Dorn of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative (NPLI), a joint program of the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and Joseph M. Henderson Chief of Staff at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and first published in 2006. The need for such an expansive view of leadership was driven by the increased complexity of natural and manmade threats facing the United States. The challenge was illustrated by the inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina that ‚Äúrevealed profound system weaknesses.‚Äù Marcus, Dorn, and Henderson posited that ‚ÄúLeadership, as commonly understood, works to build the capacity within organizations. We premise here that a different brand of leadership is necessary to get beyond that silo thinking to achieve cross-agency and cross-government coordination of strategy and effort for national terrorism and emergency preparedness.‚Äù As put forward in the first published article, effective meta-leadership was dependent upon the capacity of individual leaders to ‚Äú..envision a new connectivity of strategy and effort and then find a way to communicate, inspire, and persuade broader participation.‚Äù; situational awareness, ‚Äúseeing both the problems to be resolved as well as the people and assets that can be constructively brought to bear; and achieving connectivity, ‚Äú‚Ä¶a seamless web of people, organizations, resources, and information that can best catch (detect and report), respond, (control and contain), and return to pre-event normal (recover) from a terrorist incident.‚Äù  Extensions and Evolution  As a framework premised on integrating theory and practice through ongoing research, teaching, and field observation, meta-leadership has evolved over time as reflected in published work. The original three-dimensional model meta-leadership framework and practice method was further developed and expanded to a five-dimensional model though work that included Isaac Ashkenazi: The person of the meta-leader, the situation, leading up, leading down, and leading across.Marcus, L., Dorn, B., Ashkenazi, I., Henderson, J., & McNulty, E. (2012). \\"Crisis preparedness and crisis response: The meta- leadership model and method\\". In D. Kamien (Ed), The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook. New York: McGraw-Hill.

JAI Press: Bingley, United Kingdom.RWJ The current model in use at the NPLI builds upon but does not invalidate previous versions.  The Difference Between Leadership and Meta- Leadership  As a framework and practice method, meta-leadership draws upon and integrates a wide range of extant leadership scholarship, including that on transformational leadership, shared leadership, followership,Kellerman, B. (2008) Followership: How followers are creating change and changing leaders. Boston: Harvard Business Press complex adaptive leadership, and others. Meta- leadership is distinct in that it is focused on cross-cutting leadership that generates connectivity among disparate stakeholders in both intra- and inter- organizational settings. ‚ÄúLeadership refers to the recognized or expected span of authority that a person has in his or her formal role.‚Äù Meta-leadership is leadership employing influence over authority. ‚ÄúMeta-leaders‚Ä¶seek to influence and activate change well above and beyond established lines of their decision- making and control. These leaders are driven by a purpose broader than that prescribed by their formal roles, and are therefore motivated and capable of acting in ways that transcend usual organizational confines. Meta-leaders think and perform differently. By taking a holistic view, they intentionally link and leverage the efforts of the whole community to galvanize a valuable connectivity that achieves unity of purpose and effort.  The Three Dimensions of Meta-Leadership  # The person of the Meta-Leader (self- knowledge, awareness, and regulation): Meta-leaders develop high self- awareness, self-knowledge, and self-regulation. They build the capacity to confront fear and lead themselves and others out of the ‚Äúemotional basement‚Äù to higher levels of thinking and functioning. # The situation (discerning the context for leadership): With often incomplete information, the meta-leader maps the situation to determine what is happening, who are the stakeholders, what is likely to happen next, and what are the critical choice points and options for action. # Connectivity (fostering positive, productive relationships): The meta-leader charts a course forward, making decisions, operationalizing those decisions, and communicating effectively to recruit wide engagement and support. The meta-leader navigates the distinct dynamics and complexities of leading four facets of connectivity. #* leading down the formal chain of command to subordinates (within one‚Äôs silo), creating a cohesive high-performance team with a unified mission; #* leading up to superiors, inspiring confidence and delivering on expectations; enabling and supporting good decisions and priority setting; #* leading across to peers and intra-organizational units (other silos) to foster collaboration and coordination; #* leading beyond by engaging external entities, including affected agencies, the general public and the media to create unity of purpose and effort in large-scale response to complex events.  Meta-Leadership in Practice  Meta-leadership is particularly valuable in situations requiring connectivity and collaboration among entities, within the public sector (government agency to government agency), within the private sector (organization to organization) and between the public and private sector (where government agencies and private entities become inter-dependent to respond to widespread leadership demands). Meta-leadership is also increasingly valuable as an internal leadership framework for organizations, public and private, as large entities become less hierarchical and rely more heavily on inter-dependent intra-organizational units and extra-organizational partners. In the sphere of government emergency preparedness and response, Meta-Leadership acts as a unifying framework across different organizations and organizational units, intentionally connecting purpose and work to establish a shared course of action in times of critical need for coordinated response. On a national level, there is a heightened need for effective cross- government and cross-sector collaboration with private and non-profit organizations in order to achieve large-scale preparedness. Meta-leadership principles can provide tools to break down obstacles to collaboration that are often the result of narrow leadership focus on the interests and needs of individual silos of activity. Meta-leaders are able to imaginatively and effectively leverage system assets, information, and capacities, a particularly critical function for organizations with emergency preparedness responsibilities that are constrained by ingrained bureaucratic patterns of behavior.‚ÄùKiewra, K. (2006, Winter). The eye of the storm: What lessons do Katrina and other humanitarian crisis teach us about managing calamity? Harvard Public Health Review. Retrieved from https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp- content/uploads/2015/08/HSPH_Katrina10year.pdf It is the core of the curriculum of the NPLI Executive Education Program for senior government leaders responsible for emergency preparedness and response. It has been widely adopted in public health agencies such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Homeland Security, The Transportation Security Agency, the National Security Council of the White House, and many other public and private entities, to best meet the leadership challenges of unexpected or fast-changing situations. Invited by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to look at government‚Äôs response to Hurricane Katrina, Marcus described the need for meta-leadership in any large-scale crisis, ‚ÄúGoing forward, better communication and coordination among all levels of government, or ‚Äòconnectivity,‚Äô will prove crucial. That means not just harnessing electronic technology to forge links among agencies, but also building relationships between people‚Äîtransforming a culture that champions independent decision making into one that values cooperation.‚Äù Similar observations to Hurricane Katrina emerged during analysis of the response to the Boston Marathon Bombings, a large-scale, multi-agency, time-constrained effort studied by NPLI faculty. An additional theory of study emerged from the leadership observed during the Boston Marathon Bombing Response that is now incorporated into the meta-leadership teachings of NPLI: swarm intelligence.McNulty, et al. (forthcoming, 2016). Swarm Leadership: Establishing Behavioral Norms for the Emergence of Collective Leadership in Crisis Response.

His mother was a daughter of the Duchess of the Archipelago Florence Sanudo and her second husband Nicholas II Sanudo, and half-sister of Nicholas III dalle Carceri, the last Duke of the Archipelago from the House of Sanudo. In December 1371, she received the island of Andros as a fief, but when Nicholas III was murdered in 1383 and Francesco I Crispo became the new duke, Andros was taken from her. Maria was compensated with the island of Paros in 1389, on condition that she marry the Veronese Gaspare Sommaripa, a politically insignificant parvenu. Through the intervention of Venice, Maria also succeeded her half-brother Nicholas III as lady of one third of the island of Euboea. Crusino was a cultured man and an antiquarian; he entertained the fellow antiquarian and scholar Cyriacus of Ancona, who visited Paros often due to its famed marble quarries, with presentations of ancient statues that his men had excavated. On one occasion he even gifted him with the head and leg of an ancient statue, which Cyriacus sent to a friend, Andriolo Giustiniani-Banca of Chios. In 1440, he recovered control of his mother's possession of Andros, following a Venetian court decision. He gave the nearby island of Antiparos to his son-in-law, a Loredano.

There are many types of folds; only the most popular types are listed here. Although it is difficult to put a date on when some of these folds were first used, it is evident that their popularity boomed when the first mass production printers were introduced.  Parallel fold  Different kinds of parallel folds are concertina folds, letter folds and gate folds. = Concertina fold = A concertina fold, also known as a zig-zag fold, accordion fold or z-fold, is a continuous parallel folding of brochures and similar printed material in an accordion-like fashion, that is with folds alternatively made to the front and back in zig-zag folds. Because they do not nest (as in Letter Folds) panels can be the same size. Seen from above, concertina folds resemble a Z or M or series of zigs and zags. In bookbinding a leporello binding has its pages concertina-folded, as above, but also has front and back boards so that it can be handled like a normal book. Sometimes there is a spine too, which provides a normal page-turning experience while eliminating the gutter of normal bookbinding. The origin of the word is based on the manservant in Mozart's Don Giovanni. At one point in the opera, Leporello unfolds a lengthy concertina list of his conquests. = Letter fold = Folding pattern in which the folds are parallel and in the same direction, so that a kind of spiral is produced. The letter fold is a parallel fold. Two or more panels of the same width of the folded signature are folded around one panel. When the signature is folded twice, there are three panels on each side (six pages); with a tri-fold, the result is four panels on each side (eight pages). To allow proper nesting of panels that fold in, inside panels are usually smaller than outer panels with the inside end panel being the smallest. Also known as a spiral fold, trifold, brochure fold, business letter, C fold, roll fold and barrel fold. = Gate fold = Also known as a window fold. = Double parallel fold = In double parallel folds the paper is folded in half and then folded in half again with a fold parallel to the first fold. To allow for proper nesting the two inside folded panels are smaller than the two outer panels. = Double gatefold = In double gatefolds there are three parallel folds. The left and right edges of the paper fold and meet in the middle, without overlapping, along a center fold. The outer panels (the ones that fold in to the middle) are usually smaller than the inner panels (the ones covered by the panels that fold in) to allow for proper folding and nesting.

() is a watercolor painting by Albrecht D√ºrer. The painting was created at D√ºrer's workshop in Nuremberg in 1503. It is a study of a seemingly unordered group of wild plants, including dandelion and greater plantain. The work is considered one of the masterpieces of D√ºrer's realistic nature studies. Background In 1495 D√ºrer returned from his Wanderjahre in Italy and settled in Nuremberg, where he opened a workshop. D√ºrer was only twenty-four years old at the time, but his workshop soon gained a great reputation for the high quality of his work. In 1500 he produced what is perhaps his most famous work, his Christ-like Self-Portrait.Hutchinson, p. 67. At the same time he was also creating smaller-scale works that were more focused on the study of nature, such as the Great Piece of Turf, which he painted in 1503, and the Young Hare from the year before. Description The watercolour shows a large piece of turf and little else. The various plants can be identified as cock's-foot, creeping bent, smooth meadow-grass, daisy, dandelion, germander speedwell, greater plantain, hound's-tongue and yarrow. The painting shows a great level of realism in its portrayal of natural objects.Gombrich, p. 345. Some of the roots have been stripped of earth to be displayed clearly to the spectator. The depiction of roots is something that can also be found in other of D√ºrer's works, such as Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513). The vegetation comes to an end on the right side of the panel, while on the left it seems to continue on indefinitely. The background is left blank, and on the right can even be seen a clear line where the vegetation ends. Scholarly assessment The humanist scholar Conrad Celtes compared D√ºrer's work to the literary work of the medieval philosopher and scientist Albertus Magnus. Like Magnus, D√ºrer based his work on the observation of nature.Hutchinson, pp. 67-9. Along with the Wild Hare, the Great Piece of Turf had been called one of the masterpieces of this part of D√ºrer's work.Hutchinson, p. 69. The composition shows little order and arrangement, the various roots, stems and flowers seem to be in opposition to each other. The apparent chaos, combined with the attentive detail of each individual plant, lends the painting greater realism. Though the composition of vegetation in itself is continuous and seemingly disorganised, the blank background provides a contrast to the chaos, and imposes a sense of order. Though this work has been highly valued by later art historians, a realistic representation of nature was not a goal in itself for D√ºrer, but simply a tool for better conveying the sacred messages of his greater works.Gombrich, pp. 346-7. The Great Piece of Turf was primarily a study that would help him in the development of his art. The results can be seen both in his paintings, and in his highly detailed engravings, such as Adam and Eve from 1504.Gombrich, pp. 346-9.

The village is located approximately halfway between the towns of East Kilbride and Strathaven, on the A726. It resides in the former Parish of Glassford, which takes its name from the nearby village of the same name. History In 1854, an archaeological visit to the village indicated that there seemed to have been a chapel on the banks of Chapelton, but no remains of buildings were seen at the spot indicated, except for a font which was dug up there many years previous. Nearby was the chapel well which has since been filled in. The site is known only by tradition. However, more recent excavations have failed to find any remains of this chapel, the site of which is in a cultivated field and is crossed by a cart track. Stones forming the field boundary show no signs of having been worked. Governance Chapelton is represented by the SNP MSP Linda Fabiani in the Scottish Parliament as part of the East Kilbride constituency. Within the Westminster parliament, SNP politician Lisa Cameron represents the areas in the East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow constituency. Recent events In autumn 2009, there was controversy as one of the village's few amenities, its post office, closed. The postmistress, Jean Craig, retired after 19 years of service. There was particular worry about people having to collect their pension from Strathaven as there is only an hourly bus service through the village, resulting in a two-hour journey at the least if travelling by public transport. One of the biggest developments in recent years is that of Broadlees Golf. Originally, Robert and Barbara Anderson, farmers who had land on the outskirts of Chapelton, decided to construct a 12 bay driving range on the land. In 2005, this was followed by a caf√© and on 17 May 2009 with a nine-hole golf course. However, planning permission was given by South Lanarkshire Council in 2011 for the family to develop two 4G five-a-side football pitches, an outdoor adventure area, associated gym/dance studio/hall and clubhouse. They have also been given the go-ahead to erect two 30-metre high wind turbines on their land. In addition, there will be a further par-three, nine-hole course to the north of the existing car park which will be designed specifically with junior golfers in mind and will provide an additional golf training facility in addition to the facilities already offered. Education The village hosts Chapelton primary school, a co-educational, non-denominational primary school, which has been recently modernised under the extensive modernisation programme by South Lanarkshire Council. The new school opened its doors on 12 November 2010. The school has a small school roll of only 40 due to the small population of Chapelton and surrounding area. The current Headteacher is Mairi Mitchell, who is supported by a number of staff.  Religion  The only religious body now represented in the village is the Church of Scotland, a Christian denomination. Chapelton hosts the impressive building of Chapelton Parish Church, a congregation which is linked with Strathaven: Rankin Parish Church. The current minister, since 29 August 1991, is the Rev Shaw J Paterson. The church building is constructed primarily from sandstone with a slate roof. By the 1950s the Hamilton Presbytery of the Church of Scotland intended to re- adjust Strathaven: Rankin and had restricted Chapelton's Ministry. Readjustment within Strathaven foundered and in 1957 the Reverend John Heron was elected to be Minister at Rankin Parish Church. Subsequently, when Chapelton became vacant, discussions opened concerning a linkage between Chapelton and Rankin. Both Congregations readily agreed and the Service of Linkage was held in Chapelton on Wednesday 15 June 1960, when Mr Heron was inducted as Minister of the Linked Charge. That spirit of agreement and working together has been evident ever since. Today both Churches have fine modernised Church buildings and halls and active Congregations, with a total membership roll approaching 800. = Former Faith Groups = Formally there has been a Free Church of Scotland and an Evangelical Church in the village. The former Evangelical Church building on the outskirts of Chapelton was granted an application to turn it into a house and to build an extension.

He led the coup which overthrew Catherine's husband Peter III of Russia, and installed Catherine as empress. For some years, he was virtually co-ruler with her, but his repeated infidelities and the enmity of Catherine's other advisers led to his fall from power. Overthrow of Peter Orlov was the son of Gregory Orlov, governor of Great Novgorod. He had a younger brother Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov who would equally gain military and political prominence in Russia. Grigory Orlov was educated in the corps of cadets at Saint Petersburg, began his military career in the Seven Years' War, and was wounded at Zorndorf. While serving in the capital as an artillery officer, he caught the fancy of the then Grand Duchess Catherine Alekseyevna, and was the leader of the conspiracy which resulted in the dethronement and death of her husband, Emperor Peter III (1762). After the event, Empress Catherine raised him to the rank of count and made him adjutant-general, director-general of engineers, and general-in-chief. They had an illegitimate son, Aleksey who was named after the village of Bobriki, and from whom descends the line of the Count Bobrinsky. Orlov's influence became paramount after the discovery of the Khitrovo plot to murder the whole Orlov family. At one time, the Empress thought of marrying her favorite, but the plan was frustrated by her influential advisor Nikita Panin. Years of power Orlov's charter granting him the status of Count Orlov was no statesman, but he had a quick wit, a fairly accurate appreciation of current events, and was a useful and sympathetic counselor during the earlier portion of Catherine's reign. He entered with enthusiasm, both from patriotic and from economic motives, into the question of the improvement of the condition of the serfs and their partial emancipation. As the president of the Free Economic Society, he was also their most prominent advocate in the great commission of 1767, though he aimed primarily at pleasing the empress, who affected great liberality in her earlier years. He was one of the earliest propagandists of the Slavophile idea of the emancipation of the Christians from Ottoman rule. In 1771, he was sent as first Russian plenipotentiary to the peace congress of Foc≈üani, but he failed in his mission, owing partly to the obstinacy of the Ottomans, and partly (according to Panin) to his own outrageous insolence. Fall Meanwhile, Orlov's enemies, led by Panin, were attempting to break up the relationship between Orlov and Catherine. They informed the empress that Orlov had seduced his 13-year-old relative. A handsome young officer, Alexander Vasilchikov, was installed as her new lover.June Head, Catherine: The Portrait of An Empress, Viking Press, New York, 1935, pp.312-13. To rekindle Catherine's affection, Grigory presented to her one of the greatest diamonds of the world, known ever since as the Orlov Diamond.Malecka, Anna \\" Did Orlov buy the Orlov ?\\", Gems and Jewellery, July 2014, vol. 23, no. 6, pp. 10‚Äì12. By the time he returned ‚Äì without permission ‚Äì to his Marble Palace at Saint Petersburg, Orlov found himself superseded in the empress's favor by the younger Grigory Potemkin. When Potemkin, in 1774, superseded Vasilchikov as the queen's lover, Orlov became of no account at court and went abroad for some years. He returned to Russia a few months prior to his death in Moscow in 1783. Later years and death In 1777, at the age of 43, he married his 18-year-old relative, Catherine Zinovyeva, variously described by sources as either a niece or a cousin, but left no children by that marriage. Catherine died of tuberculosis in 1781, at the age of 23, in Lausanne, Switzerland. Her tomb, from which her body was removed in 1910, still remains in Cathedrale Notre-Dame in Lausanne. For some time before his death, he suffered from a serious mental illness, probably a form of dementia, which progressed towards complete mental collapse. After his death, the Empress Catherine wrote, \\"Although I have long been prepared for this sad event, it has nevertheless shaken me to the depths of my being. People may console me, I may even repeat to myself all those things which it is customary to say on such occasions--my only answer is strangled tears. I suffer intolerably.\\"Kaus, Gina (trans June Head), Catherine: The Portrait of An Empress, Viking Press, New York, 1935, p.314.

The company, founded in 1985 by owner and president Edward Heerema, employs 4,000 people and operates worldwide. Overview Allseas is an international offshore contractor specialising in the execution of large and complex projects, covering pipeline installation, platform installation and removal, and the installation of subsea infrastructure. The company provides support to clients already in the conceptual design stage and offer services for project management, engineering, fabrication, procurement, installation and commissioning. The Allseas Group is headquartered in Ch√¢tel-Saint-Denis, Switzerland. Allseas Engineering B.V. with offices in Delft, Eindhoven and Enschede, the Netherlands, provides project management and engineering services to the group. The company also operates project and engineering offices out of Australia, Brazil and the USA. Allseas operates a versatile fleet of specialised heavy-lift, pipelay and subsea installation vessels designed and developed in-house. The company has installed over 20,000 km of subsea pipeline worldwide using S-lay technology, with diameters ranging from 2‚Äù to 48‚Äù. Allseas‚Äô launched its first vessel Lorelay, the world's first pipelay vessel to operate on full dynamic positioning, in 1986. In 1998, Allseas added the Solitaire to its fleet. The vessel has a pipe carrying capacity of 22,000 t and has achieved pipelay speeds in excess of . In 2006, while working on the Atwater Valley and Independence Trail projects in the Gulf of Mexico, Solitaire set new depth records, laying 10-inch pipeline in 2775 m (9100 ft) water depth and 24-inch pipeline in 2550 m (8370 ft) water depth. Pioneering Spirit (Aug 2016) Allseas‚Äô Pioneering Spirit is the world's largest construction vessel, designed for the single-lift installation and removal of large oil and gas platforms and the installation of record-weight pipelines. Pioneering Spirit set a new offshore lift record with the single-lift removal of Shell's 24,200 t Brent Delta topsides in April 2017. For its first commercial job, the vessel removed the 13,500 t Yme mobile offshore production unit from Norwegian waters for Repsol in August 2016. Pioneering Spirit‚Äôs started its first pipelay job, installation of the offshore section of the TurkStream pipeline in the Black Sea, in June 2017. Allseas has committed to building an even larger version of the same design, Amazing Grace, which is scheduled to be delivered in 2022.  History  Allseas was founded in January 1985 by Edward Heerema, son of the late Pieter Schelte Heerema, founder of the Dutch offshore construction and installation company Heerema Marine Contractors. Offices subsequently opened in The Hague (the Netherlands) and Ch√¢tel-Saint-Denis (Switzerland). The company spent its early days developing the concept of dynamically positioned (DP) subsea pipelay. Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier ‚ÄúNatalie Bolten‚Äù in 1985 and converted it for DP pipelay at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened Lorelay in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986. Lorelay immediately entered service and successfully executed her first pipelay contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. In 1987, the company declared its intention to build a vessel capable of lifting entire offshore platforms. The initial idea featured two rigidly connected, self-propelled supertankers, with a large slot at the bows to install platform topsides in one piece. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company established itself a major player in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In 1992, the company acquired the former bulkhead carrier ‚ÄúTrenchwood‚Äù for conversion to Solitaire, the world's largest pipelay vessel. Allseas awarded the conversion contract to Sembawang Shipyards in Singapore on a lump sum basis; however, due to ongoing problems the contract was terminated in 1995. The ship was subsequently converted at the Swan Hunter yard on Tyneside, England. Solitaire laid her first pipe on Statoil's Europipe project in 1999. Allseas and Sembcorp reached a settlement for the Solitaire arbitration in 2006. Allseas added the shallow water pipelay and construction barge Tog Mor to its fleet in 2002. Solitaire‚Äôs S-lay capacity was increased to a holding force of 1,050 t in 2005, enabling her to lay the heaviest pipelines in unprecedented water depths. The same year Allseas launched the dynamically positioned support vessel Calamity Jane. The 225 m long dynamically positioned pipelay vessel Audacia became operational two years later. Controversy In 2007 Allseas announced plans to build ‚ÄúPieter Schelte‚Äù, a twin-hulled platform installation / decommissioning and pipelay vessel, named after the offshore pioneer Pieter Schelte Heerema, father of Allseas‚Äô owner and founder Edward Heerema. At 382 m long and 124 m wide the vessel would be the largest ever built. However, the original name created a controversy due to Pieter Schelte Heerema's service in the Waffen-SS during World War II. After the war, Pieter Schelte Heerema was arrested and sentenced to jail for three years for his ties with the Nazi war effort, according to the Dutch National Institute for War Documentation. The choice to name the ship after a Nazi SS member provoked an outcry from some politicians and Jewish groups around the world. The Dutch government gave Allseas' Netherlands subsidiary a $1 million tax break for its part in designing the ship, which added to the controversy. In February 2015, Allseas stated that the name would change to \\"Pioneering Spirit\\". Victims of ¬£73 m fraud A criminal trial in the UK in 2016 revealed that Allseas were victims of a ¬£73 m fraud. In 2011, they invested ¬£73 m with investors led by Luis Nobre claiming to have links to the Vatican and Spanish nobility.

She travelled much throughout Ireland, and in her twenties visited Italy, France, Greece, and Turkey.Dictionary of Irish Biography When the University of Dublin first began to grant degrees to women, Barlow was one of the first \\"to receive the highest honorary distinction that ancient seat of learning could bestow\\", that is, a D.Litt. \\"Miss Barlow\\" had great success with the collection of stories Irish idylls (1892). Running into nine editions, it was read in France, Germany, Britain and America. She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Dublin and was a contributor to the National Literary Society in Dublin. She was friends with Katharine Tynan and Sarah Purser, who painted her portrait in 1894. After the death of her father in 1913 she and her siblings moved to Bray, County Wicklow. By this time she was suffering from poor health and low spirits, but she continued with her writing. She died in Bray, on 17 April 1917. In its glowing obituary (18 April, 1917) The Irish Times reported nothing of her health, nor a cause of death. Barlow was a member of the Society for Psychical Research for more than 25 years. Shortly before her death, she was elected to its Committee of Reference and Publication.  Works  Barlow published under her own name and under the pseudonym Felix Ryark.

History =Colonial= In 1845, Thailand and Vietnam established a joint protectorate over the ancient Khmer Empire. With French support, Cambodia gained independence under King Norodom in 1864, but he had to accept the French protectorate of Cambodia and a strong French interference in the administration of his country. On 8 February 1864, the king founded the \\"Royal Order of Cambodia\\" as an order of merit with five degrees. After 1896, the French government and the kings of Cambodia each granted themselves the Order of Cambodia. The French president was rightly Grand Cross in the Royal Order of Cambodia. The order served to distinguish civilians and soldiers, subjects of the king or strangers, who had made themselves worthy. In 1896, the order was officially taken up in the French system of colonial orders of chivalry. For French appointments, the recipient had to be at least 29 years old and enter the Order first as a knight, to be promoted to a higher grade after a certain period. Only officers of the L√©gion d'honneur could become a commander in the Order and only commanders of the L√©gion d'honneur could be Commanders or Officers of the Order. Apart from decorations for bravery or merit during foreign campaigns, the French colonial orders also required that a certain number of years had to have been spent in the tropics or overseas to be eligible - in this case, three years in Indochina, preferably in Cambodia. From 1933 the Order was also granted for the organization of exhibitions dedicated to Cambodia and sacred events important to the French colonies. None of these rules applied for grants by the King of Cambodia himself. The colonial and overseas orders were immediately contingent on the French orders and awarded on ministerial orders. Those awarded it not only had to pay for their own registration and qualifications, but also had to buy their own insignia. =Post-colonial= In 1948 France ceased granting the order. Formally it remained a French colonial policy, but it was now only granted by the King of Cambodia. The order has since then been one of the historical orders of France. On September 1, 1950 the (colonial) French order-system was reformed. The Order of the Star of Anjouan and the Order of the Black Star were formalised as French Overseas Orders. The other three were the \\"Order of States Associated to the French Union\\" (French: \\"Ordre des √âtats de l'Union Fran√ßaise Associ√©s\\"). In 1955, Cambodia became independent. The order was approved by King Norodom Sihanouk during his government and also granted during his exile in Beijing. Even after the restoration of the Khmer dynasty it remained the highest Cambodian distinction. Degrees =\\"Dignit√©s\\"= *Grand Cross Medal worn on a large ribbon at the left hip and star worn to the gem's left. *Grand Officer Large medal on a ribbon round the neck, and the star of the order. =Other= * Commander Large medal worn on a ribbon round the neck. * Officer Medal on a rosette on the left breast. * Knight Medal on a ribbon on the left breast, with no gold on the gem. Insignia Ribbon during the colonial period (1899-1948) The medal of the order comes in many different forms, as a slightly elongated silver or gold star surmounted by a Cambodian crown and with an image of the king's crown and coat of arms in gold on a violet blue background and surrounded by a red circle. The reverse of the medal is left rough. To promote the order if it was awarded by the French, the Cambodian crown was replaced with a European one surmounted by a small cross, and in the early years the order was even awarded without any crown. The central image on the star of the order is the same as the medal, though the crown is missing and the rays are usually smooth. The star is elongated, with the vertical rays longer than the horizontal rays. The regalia of Knights is in silver, whilst those of the higher grades are gold. The medal and star are equally for civilians and soldiers. The ribbon of the order was originally green with a red border, changing in 1899 to white with an orange border (in the same year the French government changed the colours of the ribbons of all five colonial orders), before reverting to the original black ribbon when it became a purely Cambodian order again.

Her promiscuous behaviour is justified by Ashok, her husband. The title bhabhi (sister-in-law) is a respectful term for North Indian housewives. The character was promoted through a comic strip medium by anonymous activists in India. It has since been converted into a subscription- based strip and is now running on SavitaBhabhi.vip website. History The character proved controversial in India as soon as it was introduced in 2008, due to conservatism present in Indian society. Some critics felt it represented the face of India's new ultra-liberal section. The Savita Bhabhi movie was released in May 2013; it deals with the subject of internet censorship in a humorous way with Savita Bhabhi as the heroine who saves the day.  Popularity  According to BuzzFeed India, Savita Bhabhi is popular due to: # It is very sexy to see an Indian woman unapologetically going after pleasure within a society which constantly shames women for the pursuit of pleasure. # She fits the stereotypes of an Indian bhabhi, but she also breaks those stereotypes by indulging in her lust. # Though she is depicted as an upper class upper caste woman, she pursues sexual relationships with multiple people irrespective of their caste, class or gender. Controversies Production of pornography is broadly illegal in India. As a result, the original website was censored by the Indian government under its anti- pornography laws. This was met with criticism from the likes of Indian libertarian blogger and journalist Amit Varma. Eventually, mainstream media columnists joined in criticizing the ban as reflecting a \\"meddlesome, patriarchal mindset\\" of a \\"Net Nanny\\" government. This resulted in an online movement to save the character from being destroyed. Initially the creators of the site chose to remain anonymous, going under the assumed collective name Indian Porn Empire. However, in 2009, the creator of the site Puneet Agarwal, a second generation Indian living in the UK revealed his identity in an attempt to fight against the ban. However a month later, due to family pressure he announced his decision to take down the comic strip. The presence of a character bearing a resemblance to Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan was also met with criticism on Indian television channels. Influences * The producers of the upcoming comedy Bollywood film titled Sheetal Bhabhi have claimed that it draws inspiration from Savita Bhabhi. * The filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma is reported to be making a cinema movie bringing Savita Bhabhi's character to celluloid. * Savita Bhabhi, a Movie is released in May 2013. *Savita Bhabhi, played by Sai Tamhankar is set to appear at Alok Rajwade‚Äôs movie Ashleel Udyog Mitra Mandal (2020).

The symposium resulted in a book of the same title and attempted to bring together for the first time a comprehensive look at recent ethnographic research on hunter-gatherers. Eriksen and Nielson argue that the symposium was one of the high points of cultural ecology.Eriksen, Nielsen (2001), p. 82 They report the symposium as concentrating on contemporary hunters and gatherers and noted that the contributors were mostly American cultural anthropologists. The main point of the conference was that given that hunting was humanity's original source of livelihood, any theory of society and the nature of Man would require a deep knowledge of how hunters live. The symposium also emphasised the rivalry between cultural and materialist understanding of culture and society. The symposium was held at the Center for Continuing Education, University of Chicago, from April 6th to the 9th, 1966 and was attended by several of the most influential figures in then contemporary anthropology. In addition to Lee and DeVore, the symposium was attended by Marshall Sahlins, Aram Yengoyan, George Peter Murdock, Colin Turnbull, Lewis Binford, and Julian Steward.

History The church was built by the twelfth century, the tower in the thirteenth century and the spire in the fourteenth century. The spire was saved from collapse following a recommendation by William Stukeley in 1741 that it should be repaired,Bodleian Library MS. Eng. e. 125. f. 28 work which was eventually carried out in 1788 by Charles Haynes, using iron strapping. The spire was strengthened again in 1913 by the addition of internal tie bars. One of the glories of St Mary's is the 14th century (part of its east wall is 2nd phase 13th century) Corpus Christi Chapel (North Chapel). It is the earliest part of the church and has connections with an educational foundation that later became Stamford School. The ceiling is one of the very few decorated medieval wagon vaults to survive in the East Midlands, although many can still be found in the West Country. The vestry was added in 1880, with the screens and a new altar, as well as new decoration to the ceilings of the chancel and sanctuary, being completed in 1890 to designs by J. D. Sedding. In 1921, a rood was added atop the chancel screen in memory of those men of the parish who had lost their lives in the First World War. A commemorative plaque recording this event and the names of the men who died is placed south of the pulpit. In 1948, a screen was fitted to the tower arch in memory of all those who had served in the Second World War. =Present day= The parish stands in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England and receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Richborough (currently Norman Banks). Stained glass The Lady Chapel east window Christopher Whall designed the Lady Chapel east window in 1891. This was Whall‚Äôs first independent commission and was given to him by Sedding. Whall described the window as \\"the foundation and beginning of everything\\". Whall designed and made the window, with the help of one assistant, in a cowshed at Stonebridge, near Dorking in Surrey which he was using as a workshop. Meticulous preparation was said to have gone into producing the window, including the making of a suit of armour for the St Michael figure from papier-m√¢ch√© - which his assistant had to wear. The window shows Adam and Eve in the outer main lights flanking Gabriel and St Michael with the Virgin & Child in the centre light. The tracery lights are based on the Mysteries of the Rosary. At the apex of the tracery is the Coronation of the Virgin. The firing and glazing were carried out by Britten & Gilson. In The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris say of this window: \\"in a style derived from the Pre-Raphaelites but more hard edged and Impressionist\\". There is a second window dating to 1893 in the North side of the Lady Chapel; this completed jointly with Louis Davis.\\"Aglow with brave resplendent colour\\" by Peter Cormack. Published by The Charles Connick Glass Foundation Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston in 1999. Pevsner, Nicholaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England. Lincolnshire, Yale University Press. Organ The church has an organ dating from 1829 by Gray. Originally in a gallery at the west end, it was moved in 1852 to the end of the south aisle, site of the former Chapel of St Nicholas. A specification for the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. A fully electro- pneumatic action was added in 1984 by Richard Bower during an overhaul with tonal alterations. In most Oxford Movement churches, the organ speaks across the chancel. This was the case at St Mary's until 1984 when the great organ division was turned through 90 degrees so that the organ now speaks into the nave as well as across the chancel. =List of organists= *Richard Sharp *Samuel Thomas Shearman ca. 1831 *Richard Layton ca. 1839 - ca. 1876 *c. 1894 - George Thomas PatmanStamford Mercury 18 May 1894 *1898‚Äì1905 - John Clare BillingThornsby, Frederick W., ed.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History The station (known in early records as \\"Whales Back\\") was first established in 1830 for $20,000. The tower was upgraded in 1855 with a new lantern and a fourth order Fresnel lens. A fog bell and tower were installed in 1863. In 1869, storms had caused cracks in the tower and foundation causing the decision to build a new tower in 1872. The new tower, still standing today, was built with dovetailed granite blocks alongside the original tower, which was removed in 1880. The light is above mean sea level, and the tower, also housed the keeper's living quarters and a storage area. At some point the fog bell was replaced with a horn and in 1991, the volume of the horn was reduced because it was damaging the integrity of the structure. The light was automated in 1963. The current lighthouse exhibits two white flashes every 10 seconds and is created by a modern VLB-44 LED light, which was installed in October 2009. In 2007, under the National Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000, Whaleback lighthouse was made available to a suitable new steward. The American Lighthouse Foundation and its chapter Friends of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouses submitted an application and in November 2008, became the new owners. Keepers  *Samuel E.

On October 7, 2009, it began drilling on the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico. On November 9, 2009. it was damaged by Hurricane Ida. It was subsequently replaced by the Deepwater Horizon, which was responsible for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill when that rig exploded on April 20, 2010. Piper Alpha incident In 1988, as Tharos, the vessel operated as a large firefighting, construction, diving support and accommodation vessel equipped with a helicopter and a hospital ship with 22 beds, that rescued survivors from the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster. The vessel carried out firefighting on the night of the disaster and supported the fire fighting and well kill operations that led to the extinguishing of the blaze. However, flaws in the design of the vessel's extensible rescue arm prevented it from rescuing crew from the platform, while errors in the operation of the water cannon delayed their use. Divers from Tharos recovered many bodies from the seabed and from the galley area of Piper Alpha. Tharos's role in the early hours of the disaster was shown in the 1990 Scottish Television series Rescue. 2011 Ghana incident On July 6, 2011, the Transocean Marianas was evacuated due to it taking on water off the coast of Ghana.

Beginning with a comprehensive report in 2007, and even earlier, several proposals were made to implement a BRTS in Bangalore. In December 2016, the Karnataka Government cancelled the project. Mahendra Jain, additional chief secretary (urban development department), stated that the government did not consider the project feasible \\"as we have already planned for the Namma Metro.\\" He further explained, \\"The decision was taken because there was no sufficient road width available for the BRTS. The balance carriage way would be very less so we decided not to take it forward. As we have planned for Metro, two public transportation systems cannot be executed on one stretch.\\" Recommendations in CTTP, 2007 A transport survey carried out in 2007, referred to as CTTP, recommended Bangalore BRTS, with 14 routes totaling 282 km. CTTP recommended following routes : BRTS lanes under the flyover at the junction of Sarjapur Road and Outer Ring Road at Agara. * Hebbal to Bannerghatta Road along eastern crescent of outer ring road (33.0 km) * Benniganahalli (ORR) to PRR along old Madras Road (7.0 km) * From ORR to Hosur Rd along Hi-tech Corridor (8.0 km) * Hosur Road to Tumkur Road along PRR (western part) (41.0 km) * Tumkur Road-PRR Junction to Hosur Road along PRR via Tirumanahalli, Old Madras Road, Whitefield (76.0 km) * Along Core Ring Road (30.0 km) * Vidyaranyapura to Nagavarapalya via Hebbal, Jayamahal Road, Queens Road, M.G.

To impose this, BTP has decided to have traffic fines for private vehicle drivers on violating Bus Priority Lanes. Separating public buses from other private vehicles in dedicated lanes, protects them from traffic congestion and delays and improves the reliability of public services. The smoother driving also saves fuel and makes buses a more appealing mode of travel during peak hours. And this will help in controlling air and noise pollution and also to attracts more private vehicle users to shared transports. A servery conducted by Citizen for Bangalore (a civic activist group) shows that also revealed that the number of people spending over two hours daily on bus commute has substantially reduced by 62 per cent since the introduction of the city's first BPL on the Silk Board-K R Puram route. Other proposals There have also been other proposals for BRTS routes, some of these talk of new routes, and some overlap with CTTP recommendations. =Radial Corridors= In 2009, on recommendation from Agenda for Bangalore Infrastructure Development (ABIDe), City of Bangalore started investments to enhance 12 radial corridors for land based public transport. A distinctly branded bus service called Big10 was started by BMTC as part of the project. There are proposals to consider some of these corridors for BRTS. =Ring Roads= CTTP and few other proposals have talked of implementing BRTS on two large ring roads in Bangalore. BRTS was considered by BDA for Outer Ring Road, but the road has instead been taken for conversion to a signal free corridor. BRTS has also been talked about for the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR). However, since PRR itself is still in design and planning stage, there has not been much progress regarding BRTS Issues and opposition Some local public transport observers and citizens feel that most road corridors are too narrow for developing dedicated lanes for BRTS. Further, enforcement of traffic is generally seen to be weak, and many doubt if the city will be able to enforce dedicate lanes. Last, many feel that city is not mature yet to accept dedicated lanes, and private vehicle users may not like the proposal. However, many feel that despite public statements of support for the concept, BRTS implementations have not made big progress due to lack of clear ownership between BMTC, BBMP, BDA and City Traffic Police. =CTTP or Ring Road recommendations= The State Government has not taken up all recommendations from CTTP. BDA has been working on parts of the proposal since 2008. More recently, in early 2010, BDA had started on a detailed project report to implement BRTS on the eastern loop Outer Ring Road. =Bus Priority System= To work over the perceptions against BRTS, Praja Bangalore, a citizen advocacy group is pushing for Bus Priority System, wherein there would be dedicated lanes, specialized signals, underpasses for the buses only at the critical choke points on critical radial corridors. Bangalore could move towards full- fledged BRTS once the benefits of Bus Priority help work over the negative perceptions.

Since becoming associated with Shochiku, the theatre has regularly seen productions ranging from modern drama and musicals to the shinpa (New School) genre developed in the Meiji period, as well as kabuki. The Kabuki-za, located several blocks away, is the chief kabuki theatre in the world. It plays somewhat the role of a storehouse of tradition, and its stage is usually dominated by the top star actors in the genre. By contrast, many more experimental forms within the kabuki genre, as well as plays starring younger actors, are performed at the Shinbashi Enbuj≈ç. These include the Super Kabuki form pioneered by Ichikawa Ennosuke III, which incorporates Western music, Chinese, Indian, and other non-Japanese stylistic influences, and over-the-top stage special effects beyond that seen in typical kabuki, and the performances featuring the younger generation of kabuki stars. The building was destroyed in the Allied bombing of Tokyo during World War II, but was reconstructed in 1948. Major renovations were undertaken in 1982, incorporating technological upgrades, extra seating, and expanding to take over the nearby Nissan Motors Building.

The Snƒõ≈æn√≠k was considered an important geodetic point for triangulation and cartographers asked the owner of the principality of Dƒõƒç√≠n, Prince Franz of Thun and Hohenstein, for permission to establish the peak as a triangulation point. Prince Franz contracted the Dresden architect, Karl Moritz Haenel, to design a stone observation tower. The construction of the Neo-gothic tower at the summit of the Snƒõ≈æn√≠k began in 1863. A nearby fault line a source of building material. The tower was finished in autumn 1864 and was originally used by geodesists, but the view attracted many visitors and in 1865 the local forest administration decided to build a small hostelry for them. The observation tower at Dƒõƒç√≠nsk√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k has remained a popular tourist attraction and lasted, with small modifications, for more than 80 years. After the Second World War the hostelry was abandoned as it had to be pulled down. Likewise the tower deteriorated and, by the 1980s, was in poor condition. Vandals contributed to the degradation of the tower, and its masonry started to collapse. The tower was assigned to the monument fund of the State Monument Preservation, but this formal step did not bring any improvement. In 1992 two million korunas were collected for the renovation of the tower, carried out by the Dƒõƒç√≠n Kamason company, and this was followed by the erection of a new inn.

It first flew in January 1929. The Speedmail was a single-seat biplane, with two large cargo compartments in place of a front cockpit. The fuselage and tail unit were constructed from welded chrome-moly steel tube faired with wooden formers and fabric covered aft of the pilot's cockpit, and detachable aluminium alloy panels covered the fuselage forward of the cockpit. The wings were constructed from spruce spars and plywood built-up ribs, all fabric covered. It differed from previous Stearman aircraft by having a tailwheel instead of a tailskid due to its size and weight. Design and development Varney Air Lines M-2 after accident exposing mail compartment Lloyd Stearman and Mac Short, (Stearman's V.P. engineering), designed the Speedmail to the requirements of Varney Air Lines, which needed a new mail carrier with greater capacity to fly the Air Mail contracts they acquired from the U.S. Postal service while still being able to land on short, unimproved airstrips. This was achieved by using a new type of airfoil section allowing high lift at low speeds without affect the cruising speed. The result was a sturdy aircraft with a large cargo capacity. To enable Interstate Air Lines to fly passengers on its Air Mail routes from Atlanta, Stearman enlarged the M-2, into the LT-1(Light Transport), adding a four-seat enclosed cabin in place of the forward cargo compartments, the payload capacity allowed for four passenger plus luggage and 500 pounds of cargo or mail. A further development was the CAB-1 \\"Coach\\" which was designed with an enclosed cabin for use as a business aircraft. Unlike the LT-1, the pilot was inside the enclosed cabin and in front of the passengers. However, only one was built which was later dismantled when sales failed to materialize. Stearman then developed a scaled down version of the M-2, the Stearman 4 which was successful. Operational history Varney Air Lines' pilots found the M-2 difficult to handle and the Wright Cyclone engine was plagued with frequent maintenance issues. The sole surviving Stearman M-2 Speedmail is on display in the collection of the Western Antique Aeroplane & Automobile Museum in Hood River, Oregon, U.S.A.https://waaamuseum.org/collections/airplanes/637-stearman-m-2-speedmail Variants Interstate Airlines Stearman LT-1 Stearman CAB-1 Coach ;M-2 Speedmail: Single-engine mail transport aircraft, powered by a 525 hp (391-kW) Wright Cyclone radial engine, able to carry up to 1,000 lb (454 kg) of mail. ;Stearman LT-1: Slightly larger 5-seat passenger and mail carrier, powered by a Pratt & Whitney Hornet radial piston engine. ;CAB-1 Coach: Similar to the M-2 with enclosed cockpit filling gap between the fuselage and wing and powered with a 300 hp Wright J-6-7.

He also was a PhD., professor, academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (1997), academician of the Academy for Humanities Research (1998) and academician of the Academy of Pedagogical and Social Sciences (2000). He co- edited the journals \\"The Psychoanalytical Bulletin\\", \\"The Bulletin of Psychoanalysis\\", etc. He was a forerunner (with V.S. Stepin) of the Minsk philosophical school \\"Humanities Encyclopedia\\". He is considered one of the founders of modern Belarusian sociology. Biography In 1969 he graduated from the historical department of the Belarusian State University (BSU). After finishing post-graduate study at the chair of philosophy of BSU he wrote his doctoral thesis \\"Critical analysis of the personality theory of Freud's psychoanalytical system\\" (1973, BSU). From 1972 to 1982 he worked as a lecturer, a senior lecturer, and an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the BSU. In 1982-1983 he was an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the Refresher Institute for Lectures of Social Sciences of the BSU. From 1983-1987 he worked as an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the Refresher Institute for Lecturers of Social Sciences of Moscow State University, named after M.V. Lomonosov. In 1987 he was an assistant professor and later a professor (1995) of the chair of philosophy at Moscow State Linguistic University. His doctoral thesis was \\"Genesis, Foundations, Forms and Tendencies of Sociological Psychologism Development as a Phenomenon of Social Thought\\" (1995, MSU). Scientific achievements The scientific achievements of V.Ocharenko connect sociological psychologism, the problems of personality and interpersonal relations, the contents and models of mind; history, the theory and methodology of psychoanalysis and post- freudism, the human dimensions of world history, alienation and humanism, the history of philosophy, sociology and psychology; metaphilosophy and methods of teaching philosophy. He proved that the creation of the Western and Eastern versions of conceptual humanism were one of the first socially significant results of systematic philosophical activity in the Ancient world. He researched paradigms and trends of classical and modern social thought. In 1990 he elaborated the foundations of the sociological psychologism‚Äî \\"concept that regards action and interaction of social, group and individual psychical factors as a premise of research and explanation of social phenomena and processes\\" .Ovcharenko V.I., Gritsanov A.A., \\"Sociological Psychologism. Critical Analysis\\", p.3. In 1993 V.Ovcharenko initiated the campaign to return original documents and materials about the history of the Russian Psychoanalytical movement to Russia. In 1994 he published the \\"Psychoanalytical Glossary\\" ‚Äî the first Russian language edition of a dictionary and reference book on psychoanalysis that presented systematized data on the history of psychoanalysis, its ideas and leaders, terminology, founding documents, classical and modern schools and theories. He has marked out three principal stages in the development of classical psychoanalysis: 1) Clinical (1896‚Äî1905), 2) Psychological (1905‚Äî1913) and 3) Metaphysical (1913‚Äî1939). In 1996 V.Ovcharenko worked out the first historical periods of the Russian psychoanalysis and psychoanalytical movement. With Russian psychoanalyst V.Leibin, he published \\"The Anthology of Russian Psychoanalysis\\" (in two volumes) describing the first century of Russian psychoanalytical ideas. V.Ovcharenko introduced the categories of \\"sociological psychologism\\", \\"conceptual problematic complex\\", \\"conceptual problematic associations\\", \\"latent and contact world history\\", \\"dispersed rational sphere\\", \\"dispersed psychoanalytical sphere\\", \\"multibasisness of a person\\", etc. He published about 1500 articles in different countries.

In education he served as dean of Columbia College, in government he served as Third Assistant Secretary of War, and in philanthropy he served as president of the Carnegie Corporation. Biography =Early life and education= Frederick Paul Keppel was born on Staten Island, New York City, New York, United States on July 2, 1875, into a family of Dutch and Irish ancestry. His father was the senior member of the international art firm Frederick Keppel and Company. Between high school and college, Keppel worked for his father's print dealing business. In 1898 he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University and later earned honorary doctorates from Columbia University, University of Pittsburgh, University of Michigan, Hamilton College, Union College, University of Toronto, and the University of Melbourne in Australia. =Early career= After his graduation in 1898 he had a brief experience in the editorial work of a publishing house, and then returned to Columbia University from 1910 to 1918, serving successively as assistant secretary, secretary, and dean of the college. During this period he wrote and published a book on Columbia University.Columbia at Internet Archive From 1908 to 1918 he also served as secretary of the American Association for International Conciliation. In 1911 he was decorated by France as Chevalier (Knight) of the Order of the L√©gion d'honneur. Also in 1911, he helped found The New York Young Republican Club.https://nyyrc.com/history/ When World War I began, he moved to Washington, D.C. to assist in the war effort. He established himself as an unofficial adviser in the office of the Secretary of War and was soon assigned to the position of Third Assistant Secretary of War ‚Äî a position created expressly for him. He served in this position from 1918 to 1919 until he was sent to France in 1920 to act first as the director of foreign operations of the American Red Cross. From 1920 to 1921 he served as commissioner for the United States to the International Chamber of Commerce. He then returned to the United States to become secretary of the Greater New York Planning Board, and in 1922 he was elected President of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. =Carnegie period= When Keppel became president of the Carnegie Corporation, it had not formulated a long-range program of action. Thus, Keppel was free, within the limits of the Corporation's charter, to develop a policy, a philosophy, and a program. He kept a small staff, and sought external help instead of employing experts within the Corporation. Keppel's annual reports at the Carnegie Corporation constitute an important contribution to the discussion of foundation policy. They have had a determining influence on the practice and philosophy of philanthropy as applied to intellectual and cultural needs and opportunities.Memoir presented to the American Council of Learned Societies at its annual meeting, 1944, and ordered to be included in the Proceedings of the meeting. His comments and observations were of particular interest to the American Council of Learned Societies. Before the Association of American Colleges and Universities, in 1930, he insisted upon the importance to the United States of knowledge of Asian culture, and upon the necessity of including Asian languages in American curricula.

It was the first label to release music from cult horror films such as The Wicker Man. On his label he has also released Dirty Fan Male, an album based on his own experiences organising various glamour models' fan clubs including that of his sister, Emma Benton-Hughes, who modelled under the name Eve Vorley. The album contained amusing recitals of the fan mail they received, and was later turned into an award-winning live show and a book, with the album getting 4/5 stars from The Guardian. Trunk has also released his own material through the label, including his album The Inside Outside. Since 2003, Trunk has been responsible for the rediscovery of Basil Kirchin, by releasing his unknown 1960s experimental jazz and soundtrack work. \\"The Ladies' Bras\\", a single by Jonny Trunk and Wisbey, made number 70 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007, and re-entered at number 27 in September 2007 after a campaign by BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills and Danny Baker. At 36 seconds long, it is the shortest track ever to chart in the top 30. =Directing, teaching= Various Jonny Trunk side projects have included directing the now- banned pop video \\"Plug Me In\\" for Add N to (X). This video was shot in Wales, and was edited as the standard pop version and a longer, more controversial Add N To XXX 45 minute version. Trunk has also held modern music and movement classes using vintage electronic recordings, issued official Tony Hart Vision On tee shirts and screenprints, ran action painting sessions to Ken Nordine's colours, and regularly finds music for advertising, film and TV. In recent years Trunk has been lecturing at art colleges throughout the UK. His talks focus on the art of creativity based on nostalgia, enthusiasm and cunning. =Broadcasting= Trunk is also a regular broadcaster on London's art radio station Resonance FM. His long-running radio show OST has concentrated on film music, TV music, library music and related recordings since 2004 and is the only show of its kind on British radio. It has championed the work of Fran√ßois de Roubaix, Roger Roger (composer), Krzysztof Komeda and many other obscure international soundtrack and library artists. Other recent broadcasting has included the BBC Radio 4 documentary Into The Music Library and presenting on BBC Two's The Culture Show. Trunk was the first dedicated film music DJ in the UK. =Writing, publishing= HarperCollins published the Jonny Trunk book Dirty Fan Male in 2004. It subsequently became a Channel 4 documentary. He also writes for Vice, Record Collector, and Mojo. Working with art publishers FUEL Design, Jonny Trunk published the world's first and only book dedicated to the graphic art of production library music on Trunk Records. This book, known as The Music Library, was the first book to bring to the public the hidden art and design of vintage library recordings. The book was expanded in 2016. The original \\"Music Library\\" book was followed up, in late 2010, with the world's first overview of the life and early publishing work of John Sutcliffe, the underground leather couturier who started AtomAge. 2011 saw the publication of Own Label, Sainsbury's Design Studio 1962 - 1977. This book brought together a vast array of own label packaging developed and designed by the supermarket's in house studio. Conceived by Jonny Trunk and based on his memory of the 1975 Own Label Cornflake packet, the book brings some 400+ rare, period and often curious designs from the Sainsbury's Archive into the modern graphic world. Trunk licensed the document and letter archive of Mary Whitehouse based at the University of Essex, and made a deal with publishers Faber and Faber. The book based on this material, Ban This Filth! Letters From the Mary Whitehouse Archive (2012), was edited by Ben Thompson. 2014 saw the publication of \\"The Art Of Smallfilms\\", a book exploring the archives of Smallfilms and the world of Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin.

Life Maria Sanudo was a daughter of the Duchess of the Archipelago Florence Sanudo and her second husband Nicholas II Sanudo, and half-sister of Nicholas III dalle Carceri (r. 1371‚Äì1383), the last Duke of the Archipelago from the House of Sanudo. =Lady of Andros= After Florence Sanudo died, she was succeeded by her son Nicholas III. As he was still a minor, the regency was exercised for a time by Nicholas Sanudo. In December 1371, Maria received from her half brother (in reality from her own father in his capacity as regent) the island of Andros, the second largest island of the duchy after Naxos, as a fief. The grant stipulated that as feudatories of the Duke, Maria and her heirs were obliged to render personal military service for a three- month period each year, as well as send twenty marines for the ducal galleys for two months every year. Maria was also obliged to not marry without her half-brother's permission, as well as to look after her younger sister Lisia, and find her a suitable husband. In reality, as Maria too was under-age, the oath of fealty and the ceremony of investiture were probably undertaken by Nicholas Sanudo, who also exercised the governance of the island until his daughter's coming of age, as he is mentioned in contemporary documents as dominus insule Andre. In 1372, Maria also received a grant of the small island of Antiparos and the domain of Lichada on Euboea. Nicholas III, probably again under the influence of his stepfather, later changed the terms of the grant from a feo to a censo, replacing the owed military service with an annual rent. Soon after coming of age himself and dispensing with his stepfather's regency, however, he tried to renege on the change. Nicholas Sanudo turned to the Republic of Venice, which in August 1373 ordered Nicholas III to redress the issue. At about the same time, the issue of Maria's marriage came to the fore following the failure of negotiations for her marriage to the son of Boniface Fadrique, lord of Salona, Lidoriki and Aigina. As had been the case for her mother, due to her possessions in Euboea, the affair was of great concern to Venice: the local Venetian bailo of Negroponte, Bartolomeo Querini, suggested a marriage to his son Zanino. Nicholas Sanudo went to meet the bailo at Negroponte and agreed, in exchange for assistance in the matter of his daughter's domains. The deal was kept a secret, and the unsuspecting Nicholas III gave his consent. Maria and her father travelled to Negroponte, but in the event the marriage fell through, for almost at the last minute, Nicholas III fell out with the bailo, perhaps suspecting his designs, and revoked his permission. In 1376, there was yet another marriage attempt, this time with George III Ghisi; the match had the approval of Venice and received a papal dispensation‚ÄîMaria and George were third cousins‚Äîbut in the event the wedding never took place. =Lady of Paros= Nicholas III was murdered in 1383 by Francesco I Crispo (r. 1383‚Äì1397), who became the new duke. The new ruler promised to \\"treat as his own child\\" Maria, but she continued to challenge his right to rule. Seeking to cement his position and gain recognition from the Venetian bailo at Negroponte, Crispo arranged a marriage between his daughter and Pietro Zeno, the son of the bailo. As his daughter's dowry, he gave the islands of Syros and Andros, which he took from Maria. As a compensation, she was given the island of Paros in 1389, on condition that she marry the Veronese Gaspare Sommaripa. Paros (and Antiparos) were a not inconsiderable fief: the islands were valuable, and each furnished thirty sailors to the ducal galleys. Nevertheless, the marriage was a calculated political ploy by Crispo: Sommaripa may have been connected to his fellow Veronese dalle Carceri, but held no feudal rank or titles, and the new duke intended to neutralize Maria by marrying her to this politically insignificant parvenu. Through the intervention of Venice, Maria also succeeded her half-brother as lady of one third of the island of Euboea. From her marriage with Gaspare Sommaripa, Maria had Crusino I Sommaripa, and Fiorenza Sommaripa, wife of Duke Giacomo I Crispo (r. 1397‚Äì1418). Throughout her life, Maria did not abandon her claims to Andros, and after half a century of legal disputes, in 1440 her son Crusino was able to regain possession of it. Giacomo I was succeeded by his brother, John II Crispo (r. 1418‚Äì1433), who, in the words of William Miller, \\"acted with a complete lack of chivalry towards his sister-in-law and her mother, Maria Sanudo, reducing them to penury and exile by depriving them of their islands\\" until 1421, conceding only after repeated remonstrations by the Venetian authorities, backed by the threat of force. Maria Sanudo died in 1426.

In the nine months of its existence, the China Air Task Force had been credited with shooting down 149 Japanese planes, plus 85 probables, with a loss of only 16 P-40s. It had flown 65 bombing missions against Japanese targets in China, Burma and Indochina, dropping 311 tons of bombs and losing only one B-25 bomber.

The square is rectangular in shape, with measurements of 142 metres by 129 metres and with two streets radiating out of every corner. In the middle there was a row of houses, with its southern wall made by the Town Hall. However, when in 1825 the tower of the Town Hall burned, all adjacent houses were demolished and a new hall, with a 65-metre tower, was built in 1835 by architects J. Markl and F. Trescher. Around the square, there are 44 tenement houses, which represent several architectural styles, from Renaissance to Modernism. In the four corners, there are fountains‚Äîwells from 1793, probably designed by Hartman Witwer. The sculptures represent four Greek mythological figures: Neptune, Diana, Amphitrite and Adonis. In front of the Town Hall, there was a pillory. In 1998 the Market Place, together with the historic city center of Lviv, was recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site.  History  The square was designed soon after Lviv‚Äôs location as a city. Originally, the buildings were Gothic; however, a great fire on 3 June 1527 destroyed most of the city. The new city, then known in Polish as Lwow, was rebuilt in Renaissance style, with a few remaining examples of Gothic architecture. There is a vault in tenement house number 24 and a portal in house number 25. Market Square was witness to several important events in the history of Poland and Ukraine. Among these, in 1387 King Wladyslaw Jagiello accepted the homage of Petru I of Moldavia here. In 1436 another Moldavian ruler, Ilias of Moldavia, paid homage to King Wladyslaw III in Lviv. Also, at the pillory, several historical figures were executed by the Polish authorities including rulers of Moldavia ≈ûtefan Tom≈üa (1564), Ukrainian national hero Ioan PotcoavƒÉ (Ivan Pidkova) (1578) and Iancu Sasul (1582). In 1848, during the Spring of Nations, a Polish National Guard was formed here. On 11 November 1920, prime minister Jozef Pilsudski hosted a military parade to commemorate awarding the Virtuti Militari cross to the city. Also, on 30 June 1941, Yaroslav Stetsko proclaimed Ukraine's independence in a house located on the square. In 2006, a major restoration of the square‚Äôs pavement was carried out.

History =Beginnings= Originally known as the Warner Bros. Theatre or Warner Hollywood Theatre,It was sometimes called The Warner Hollywood Theatre to avoid confusion with another Warner Theatre in Los Angeles, known as \\"Warner Downtown Theatre\\" at 401 W. 7th St. the Italianate beaux arts building was designed by architect G. Albert LansburghOther Los Angeles theatres designed by Lansburgh include the Orpheum Theatre, Shrine Auditorium, El Capitan Theatre and Wiltern Theatre. with approximately 2,700 seats. It opened on April 26, 1928, showcasing the studio's early Vitaphone talking film Glorious Betsy, starring Conrad Nagel and Dolores Costello. Warner Bros. owned radio station KFWB positioned its radio transmitter towers on top of the building, which remain to this day. Though covered by \\"PACIFIC\\" lettering, the original \\"WARNERS\\" lettering can still be seen inside each tower. =Renovation for widescreen= In an era when theaters were forced to compete with television by introducing widescreen, the venue was one of the few in Hollywood large enough to convert to Cinerama. After renovations, it reopened on April 29, 1953, as the Warner Cinerama showing This is Cinerama. The new screen was 28 feet by 76 feet with a 146 degree arc, and seating was reduced to approximately 1,500 to accommodate the new screen size. This is Cinerama played for 115 weeks, grossing an L.A. record of $3,845,200. It closed 132 weeks after it opened and on November 15, 1955, Cinerama Holiday opened (after two premieres on the 7th and 14th) and played for 81 weeks, grossing $2,212,600. It was followed by the third Cinerama film, Seven Wonders of the World, which played for 67 weeks, grossing $1,659,361. In 1961, the theater was equipped to run 70mm films and showed both 70 and 35mm films. The last of the three-strip Cinerama presentations was the American premiere run of How the West Was Won for 93 weeks in 1963 and 1964. In 1968, Stanley Warner sold the theater to Pacific Theatres, which renamed it the Hollywood Pacific Theatre. In the late '60s and early '70s, two Stanley Kubrick films had long runs at the theatre: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) played for 80 weeks, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) also had a long run. On January 31, 1978, the theater closed and two screens were added at a cost of $1.2 million by converting the balcony section into two 550-seat areas as well as equipping the theater with Dolby Stereo. It re-opened on May 26, 1978 with Thank God It's Friday and the re-issue of American Graffiti. =End of use for exhibiting films= The theater finally closed its doors as a full-time cinema on August 15, 1994. This was mostly due to water damage to the basement caused by the construction of the Red Line Hollywood Subway and structural damage caused by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. To date, the balcony sections remain closed off due to structure safety issues. The theater has since been designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. =Influence on Carol Burnett's star on Hollywood Walk of Fame= In the '50s, a young Carol Burnett was working as an usherette when the theater was showing Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951). Having already seen the film, she advised two patrons arriving during the last 10 minutes of a showing to wait until the beginning of the next showing to avoid spoiling the ending for them. The manager observed Burnett, let the couple in, and then callously fired her, stripping the epaulettes from her uniform. Years later, in the '70s, after achieving TV stardom, when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce offered her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they asked her where she wanted it. She replied \\"Right in front of where the old Warner Brothers Theater was, at Hollywood and Wilcox\\", which is where it was placed, at 6439 Hollywood Blvd. =Digital Cinema Lab= From 2001 to 2006, it was used by Entertainment Technology Center at USC for experiments in digital projection and dubbed the ETC Digital Cinema Lab in Hollywood, administered by Eduardo K√©ith. A new flat screen was installed along with a new JBL sound system. Screenings for Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers members included I, Robot, Collateral, and Crash.

First contested in 1968, the Vic-Maui runs in even- numbered years, starting in June or July off Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and finishing near Lahaina, Maui, United States, a distance of approximately . Vic-Maui challenges navigators to demonstrate their weather routing and navigational skills. Success depends on the navigator's skill in predicting where the high pressure zone of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and trade winds will be, nearly a week into the future.  History  The first Vic-Maui race was sailed in 1965. The race was created by Royal Vancouver Yacht Club (RVYC) member Jim Innes, at that time a pilot for Canadian Pacific Airlines. He talked about the idea of a race originating in Victoria and ending some 2308 nautical miles away in Maui, and convinced three other skippers to start with him off Brotchie Ledge in 1965. With Jim in his Lapworth 36' \\"Long Gone\\", there was Lol Killam of RVYC with the 45' sloop \\"Velaris\\", Ron Ramsay of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club with the 45' ketch \\"Norena of White\\" and Cranston 'Boo' Paschall from Seattle Yacht club with his 80' ketch \\"Tatoosh\\". The race and the weather were typical for most of the races to follow. Westerlies in the Juan de Fuca Strait, left turn down the coast to about the latitude of San Francisco followed by a right turn with the northeasterly trade winds filling spinnakers and the downhill sun run to Maui. Three boats finished the race some 15 days later at Kahalui Harbour on the north coast of Maui with the fourth \\"Tatoosh\\", having used the motor and arrived prior, greeting the three arrivals with Mai Tais. During their stay in Maui they met up with the originators of what would become the Lahaina Yacht Club. Upon returning to BC waters both Jim and Lol proceeded to convince the RVYC and the newly organized LYC to jointly sponsor such a race and thus the Vic-Maui International Yacht Race was born. The first official race was in 1968 with 14 boats entered. Bill Killam's Porpoise III swept the fleet first to finish and first on corrected time. She took 17 days, 6 hours and 50 minutes. The race, heralded as a FUN RACE has encouraged both the ardent racer and the cruiser-racer. It has been held every even year since 1968 with 2014 being the 25th Vic-Maui race. The number of entrants has ranged from 4 to 37 boats. Records have been broken many times since the first official race in 1968. \\"Grand Illusion\\" skippered by James McDowell of the LYC completed the race in 9 days, 2 hours and 8 minutes in 2000, breaking the previous record of 9 days, 19 hours and 36 minutes set by \\"Pyewacket\\" skippered by Roy Disney in 1996. In 2016, on the 50th anniversary of the race, \\"Valkyrie\\", a TP52 of the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club skippered by Jason Rhodes and Gavin Bracket set a new record of 8 days, 9 hours, and 17 minutes.

Before the band's 2009 fall tour, original drummer Steve Clemens left the band and was replaced by current drummer Mike Greenfield. The loss of Clemens triggered a gradual departure from the band's improvisational roots and a stylistic shift from organic electronica and jazz/funk fusion to electro-pop, indie rock and hip-hop. The album Lotus was released on Sept. 13, 2011. The band recorded the album between December 2009 and October 2010 with Bill Moriarty in Philadelphia, with additional recordings made in the home studios of Jesse and Luke Miller and at various locations around the country.

The pilot and first series were broadcast on digital radio station BBC Radio 7. The second series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Sketches include a spoof of children's television show Postman Pat called Postmodern Pat, a mosquito who has seen too many Hitchcock films, and her childhood hamster, Edward, who became the subject of the graphic novel, The Diary of Edward the Hamster 1990‚Äì1990. The programme was first broadcast as a pilot on 7 March 2007, as one of 10 entries for BBC Radio 7's \\"Witty and Twisted\\" competition. A Series of Psychotic Episodes won the competition and was awarded by having a full series, first broadcast on 2 November 2008. A second series was commissioned and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2010. History A Series of Psychotic Episodes first began as a pilot for BBC Radio 7's \\"Witty and Twisted\\" competition. In the competition, a series of comedians were invited to create their own radio show pilots, the best of which would be commissioned for a full series. Elia's pilot first reached a shortlist of fifty, which was later reduced to ten finalists. Each finalist then recorded a new fifteen-minute pilot. The finalists' pilots were broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 7. Out of these, A Series of Psychotic Episodes was chosen as the winner and Elia awarded a series. One of the runners up, Gus Murdoch's Sacred Cows written and performed by Stephen Carlin, was also given a full series. After A Series of Psychotic Episodes was broadcast, it was nominated for the comedy award in the Sony Radio Academy Awards. This was seen as unusual, as the show was a single pilot performed by a relatively unknown comedian. However, it lost the award to Down the Line. In 2010, the series moved to BBC Radio 4. Reception A Series of Psychotic Episodes has had positive reviews from critics. Harry Deansway from The Guardian said that Elia was a welcome change saying that: \\"Radio comedy is largely populated by plummy World Service voices doing skits that sound like unironic Mr Cholmondley-Warner sketches from Harry Enfield's TV series, so the different tone and voice of Miriam Elia's A Series Of Psychotic Episodes really stands out.\\" However, Deansway also said, \\"the show's not quite the finished product, though it probably offers a glimpse into the future of British comedy.\\" References External links Miriam Elia's official website Category:BBC Radio 4 programmes Category:2007 radio programme debuts Category:BBC Radio comedy programmes Category:BBC Radio 7 (rebranded) programmes ","title":"A Series of Psychotic Episodes"},{"id":"19988172","text":"The Bach Air Yacht was a trimotor airliner produced in the United States in the 1920s. Typical of its day, it was a high-wing braced monoplane, with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Unusual for airliners of the late 1920s, (due to legislation that forbade carrying passengers in wooden aircraft), the Air Yachts were constructed almost entirely of wood with steel fittings, undercarriage and struts. Different models were powered by varying combinations of Wright, Ryan-Siemens, Kinner, Comet, and Pratt & Whitney engines, a large engine in the nose of the aircraft and two smaller \\"helpers\\" under the wings in nacelles supported by struts. As with so many aircraft companies of the late 1920s the Bach Aircraft Company succumbed to the Great Depression, thus further development of the Air Yacht was abandoned after the 3-CT-9.

The church serves a free community breakfast, 9-10 AM, every Sunday morning. The meal is open to all, with no religious expectations or requirements. Worship services are also open to everyone, 10-11 AM, every Sunday.  History  The church was founded by Peter Greensky (1807-1866) also known as Shagasokicki, a Chippewa chief who had been converted to Christianity and became a preacher. It was founded in 1844.Walter Romig, Michigan Place Names, p. 239 Greensky was introduced to Christianity by John Sunday. He was baptized into the Methodist Church in 1833, and licensed to preach in 1844.Northern Christian Advocate Obituary of Greensky linked through Find a Grave Greensky worked with Salmon Stell in operating the Pine River Indian Mission. He was later connected with the Isabella Indian Mission. From 1869-1871 he was in charge of the Oceana Indian Mission. He decided to build a Protestant mission where he could preach and convert his Native American brothers and sisters to Christianity. According to the historical marker at the church, the first services were held in makeshift buildings of bark and boughs until the 1850s, when a church was constructed from lumber brought by canoe from Traverse City and then ported two miles to the site of the present day church. Around the church was a circle of \\"council trees\\" where the Indian chiefs could meet in peace to discuss tribal issues.  Today  The original church is still used by a congregation that celebrates both Christianity and Native American customs. In regular attendance are Peter Greensky's descendants: his great-great-great-grandson, Ray Greensky and Ray's son Brayden Greensky and daughter Isabelle Jean Greensky.

The Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) is a free online database of the Getty Research Institute using a controlled vocabulary, which by 2018 contained over 300,000 artists and over 720,000 names for them, as well as other information about artists.ULAN FAQ Names in ULAN may include given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time (e.g., married names). Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. Although it is displayed as a list, ULAN is structured as a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. The focus of each ULAN record is an artist. In the database, each artist record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. The artist's nationality is given, as are places and dates of birth and death (if known).Lerner, Heidi G. (2008).\\"Resources for Jewish Biography and Autobiography on the Internet\\". Shofar 26(2), 128‚Äì142. Linked to each artist record are names, related artists, sources for the data, and notes. The temporal coverage of the ULAN ranges from Antiquity to the present and the scope is global. Artists may be either individuals (persons) or groups of individuals working together (corporate bodies). Artists in the ULAN generally represent creators involved in the conception or production of visual arts and architecture. Some performance artists are included (but typically not actors, dancers, or other performing artists). Repositories and some donors are included as well. About ULAN History Development of the ULAN began in 1984 by the J. Paul Getty Trust. The Trust, which already managed the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), began the project in response to requests from Getty projects for controlled vocabularies of artists' names. The ULAN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program.Harpring, Patricia (2010). \\"Development of the Getty Vocabularies: AAT, TGN, ULAN, and CONA\\". Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America 29(1), 67‚Äì72. Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval. The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized \\"union list\\" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international standards for thesaurus construction. Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels. The ULAN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and later Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute).Austin, David L. (1995). Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America 14(2), 48‚Äì49. The ULAN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. The ULAN was published in 1994 in hardcopy (Union List of Artist Names. Project manager, James M. Bower; senior editor, Murtha Baca. New York: G.K. Hall, 1994) and machine-readable files. Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ULAN, by 1997 it had become evident that hard- copy publication was impractical. It is now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for ULAN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the ULAN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the ULAN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management. Design Even though the structure is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 500000001); it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body. Entities in the Person facet typically have no children. Entities in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships.

She was born in Minsk, Belarus.  Career  Pavlina started gymnastics at the age of 7. She trained 48 hours per week at club Dynamo Minsk with Irina Leparskaya and Belarusian master Galina Krylenko. Pavlina made her senior debut at the 1993 Medico Cup in Austria, where she placed 3rd in the all-around and took two more bronze medals with clubs and ribbon at the final events. She got her big break later that year, when teammate Larissa Lukyanenko broke her ankle in training. At 15 years old, Pavlina was called upon to replace Lukyanenko in the 1993 World Championships. She helped the Belarusian placed 5th in the Team Event. Pavlina was not chosen for the 1996 Belarusian Olympic Team, but she did compete in most major International events that year. After the retirement of Lukyanenko, Pavlina stepped up to become the Belarusian number two. At the 1997 Schmiden International, she scored the all-around silver as well as all four apparatus golds. At the Derjugina Cup she also earned a pair of bronze medals for the all-around and rope. At the Gymnastics Masters competition in Germany, she won a pair of medals in all four apparatus, silver with hoop, bronze with ball, and gold with clubs and ribbon. With Tatiana Ogrizko's retirement the following World Championships, Pavlina took over leadership and became Belarusian number one. she won the silver medal at the 1998 European Championships in all-around, as well as a gold in ribbon and team event. She also finished 3rd in All-around at the 1998 Goodwill Games. Although Pavlina still competed at major internationals in 1999, she had begun to be eclipsed by teammate Yulia Raskina.

The 1842 and 1843 editions were only 48 pages while, the 1855 edition was considerably expanded by Blacker with hand-painted, colored illustrations and 252 pages. Synopsis Blacker's Art Fly Making is best described by the author himself in the preface to the second edition (1855): > I know not how to apologise for submitting a Second Edition of this little > Book to the notice of the Angling few, after the appearance of so many by > clever writers, except the many calls I had for It, and a sincere desire of > improving farther upon a craft that has not hitherto been clearly > promulgated by a real practitioner; consequently my great object is to > benefit and amuse my readers, by giving them something practical, which at > the present time may be particularly wanted by those who love to make their > own flies, whose wants, without doubt, will be found sufficiently supplied > in this book; the tyro will appreciate it as valuable to him, and the senior > angler who may, perchance, be in possession of it, and who may be singularly > fond of making his flies, and amusing himself dyeing the hackles and > colours, &c.;, will, I am persuaded, consider it a treasure. > My endeavours have been unceasing for many years past, in striving to please > the great Salmon Fishers and Trout Fishers of this Country, and I must > confess that my labours have not been in vain; they have generously > conferred upon me their very kind patronage and good will, benefits for > which I hold them in very great estimation. Under these circumstances, I > have taken much pains to write the book in a befitting manner to suit their > tastes and purposes, although my inability in many instances has been an > obstacle, nevertheless with all my faults I claim the title of Fisherman, an > humble and unimportuned name which no reasonable dispensation can deprive me > of. > From my boyhood, I took great delight in ranging along the banks of the > beautiful and romantic streams of my native land, Ireland; and having also > been for many years a skilful Fly Fisher of no little commendation, in both > Great Britain and Hibernia, it is my desire to impart to the world, plainly > and easily, the knowledge I have acquired, that all those who wish to become > masters of the art, may, by patience and practice, and a close adherence to > the instructions I shall lay down, derive the fullest benefit from my > experience. > I have endeavoured in the following treatise on Fly-making, to divest the > subject, as far as possible, of all technicalities and superfluities; at the > same time, I have entered into such full details in the construction of the > Fly, that by adopting the process I have pointed out, and following the > instructions I have given, the aspirants to the art of Fly-making may > speedily become proficients. > In this little book there will be found nothing imaginary, but it is purely > written from the practice of angling, so that I may without scruple, justly > entitle it The Art of Fly-making, Angling, and Dyeing of Colours. It is also > interspersed with many useful remarks that will no doubt agreeably entertain > my readers. > No man has taken such pains to improve upon the angler's craft as I; on > every article in the whole range of fishing tackle I have made some > improvement on rods, flies, lines, reels, and tackle of every sort; and in > these pages have left a lasting memorial of my handicraft to the fly-fisher, > from whom I have hidden nothing that might retard him in his progress, and > who will appreciate it for the great deal of matter propounded in little > compass to prevent incumbrance; that the lovers of fly fishing, which has > superior claims, may have an opportunity of keeping it in their side > pocket,‚Äîto be convenient and handy when on their piscatory excursions, the > exercise and variety of which will be found advantageous to the health, and > the calming of the mind‚Äîthings not to be purchased; enjoying at the same > time the harmonious notes of the warblers of the grove, and musing upon the > diversity of the prospects around, while straying along the beautiful > streams and vallies of this delightful country. > The list of flies I have given, will be found very valuable, and the tyro > will take great delight in imitating these flies necessary for use, and > suiting the colours exactly to each, keeping to their symmetrical forms as > they appear with his light materials. This beautiful branch of fly-making, > peculiarly my own, cannot fail to perfect the angler who is scientific and > ingenious, the result of which will be never-failing success. > I have added to the art of fly-making full instructions, and the most > approved receipts for dyeing mohair, pighair, feathers, and other materials > most useful and appropriate for imitating the natural flies and stuffs the > most killing for Trout and Salmon; and which will retain their brilliancy > through all the vicissitudes to which they may be exposed. > To bring the Engravings of the flies to the greatest perfection, I have > stood at the elbow of the artist who executed this part of the work, that > they might be turned out exact to my own models, which renders them and the > descriptions more intelligible, as the shade in the fibre of each feather is > shown in the plate, in the clearest and finest manner imaginable, that it > may be properly seen how these artificial flies are constructed,‚Äîthe > resemblance of those beautiful ones, the productions of the Great Author of > Nature, that Trout and Salmon do love to feed upon. > I have also given the principal rivers of England, Ireland, Scotland, and > Wales, with the flies best adapted to each, which will enable the fisher to > have all things in readiness on his arrival at their localities, and sally > out on the finny tribe fearless of disappointment; and for the younger > branch of anglers, I have shown the various sorts of fish, with the tackle > and baits best adapted to catch them. > The catechism of fly making which I have introduced will be found very > curious and instructive to the young beginner, and will afford him every > opportunity of retaining the whole process, that when rehearsed in the mind, > and perfectly understood, he may apply, with more certain facility, the hand > to both material and hook. > Published by the Author, WILLIAM BLACKER, At 54, Dean Street Soho, 1855. Reviews * Bell's Life in London, a noted British sporting journal wrote this review in 1855: > Mr. Blacker has been a celebrated trout and salmon angler from early > boyhood, and he is known to be the best maker of trout and salmon and flies > alive. We have never seen such flies as his, for naturalness of shape, > appropriateness of colour and for beauty and solidity of finish. In making > flies he has \\"caught a grace beyond the reach of art\\" and this he exhibits > in the Sanspareil work before us. It contains no fewer than seventeen > engravings on steel and copper, of, trout and salmon flies, in every stage > of fabrication, from the whipping of hook and gut together to the finishing > of the head. These engravings every plate crowded with figures, are executed > after his own models and under his own Surveillance and carefully and > beautifully coloured, he standing, as he says, \\"by the artist's elbow\\". They > contain coloured representations of hackles, wing-feathers, fur, silk, > tinsel, in their natural state, and prepared for forming the artificial > insect. His profusely illustrated instructions for making salmon-flies are > entirely original there being nothing at all like them in any work extant, > and he must be a dull scholar indeed, who shall not, after brief study of > them, become his own salmon fly dresser. > Never, was a book more honestly and conscientiously written. It glows with > deep-felt enthusiasm for his art, and with a generous desire of revealing > everything that pertains to the perfect acquisition of it in all its > branches. It is a work of great labour and long pains-taking, unique at all > points, and no one could have written it but a practical angler of long, > passionate, and devoted experience in the capture of salmon and salmonidae, > and of ne plus ultra perfection in the art of making artificial flies, and > concomitantfishing tactle. The work is published by himself, at 54, Dean > Street, Soho, and we recommend it more earnestly than we have ever done any > other work of the sort. * In 1921, John Waller Hills in A History of Fly Fishing for Trout wrote: > It is of interest to compare the directions in Barker, Venables and Cotton > with those in Blacker, two centuries later. I am referring to Blacker's > third book, the Art of Fly-Making (1855). In it he gives the reverse winged > fly as the first and easiest pattern; all his directions are very like the > earlier writers, with the important difference that his wings were made of > two slips. He also gives directions how to wing the other way; but anyone > reading the two accounts together will not find much difference. * Alec Jackson in The American Fly Fisher (1982) wrote: > William Blacker (the Irishman who operated a tackle shop as 54 Dean Street, > Soho, London) was acknowledged as one of the best trout and salmon fly > dressers of his day. His fly dressing methods are described and illustrated > in his book the Art of Fly Making, which first appeared in 1842 and was > reissued in 1843 and again in 1855 In 2001, noted fly fishing historian Andrew Herd wrote: > Blacker's advice on fly tying was a radical departure from this predecessor. > For a start, he gave totally different methods for tying trout and salmon > flies, and much of his writing was taken up by a manual devoted to the > details of how to dress individual flies. > Where the salmon fly is concerned, Blacker was the torch that illuminated > the night and the pattern he created suddenly lifted the sights of many of > his contemporaries. His fame spread so far and wide that is wasn't long > before he could afford to charge three pounds for a month's tuition of four > hours each day at trout and salmon fly tying.

The distillery, which was formerly known as Ledaig, was founded in 1798 and has changed hands several times, having undergone a number of periods of closure. The only distillery on Mull, it is currently owned by Burn Stewart Distillers, a subsidiary of Distell Group Limited of South Africa. Its main product, Tobermory single malt, is used in the blends Scottish Leader and Black Bottle. The distillery also produces a smaller amount of peated whisky, which remains known under the former name, Ledaig. History The distillery was founded as Ledaig distillery in 1798 by John Sinclair, ten years after the founding of Tobermory by the British Fisheries Society. Sinclair had originally arrived in the village as a merchant dealing with soda ash from burning the locally available kelp. In April 1797, he applied for 57 acres to the south of the harbor in order to build houses and a distillery. Distilling had been banned in the UK since 1795 in order to save grain for the War of the First Coalition with France. Although he was originally told to build a brewery instead, he remained with the original plan and additionally built a pier known as \\"Sinclair's Quay\\". The current buildings were constructed during that first period of occupation, and were licensed in 1823. It was acquired by John Hopkins & Co in 1890, and by Distillers Company in 1916 before closing in 1930 following a drop in the demand for whisky due to ten years of prohibition in the United States. The colourful houses of Tobermory village In 1972 it was reopened under the name of Ledaig Distillery (Tobermory) Ltd. In May 1975, production had to stop for a month as storage space for the whisky had run out. The construction of a bonded warehouse had been delayed, causing fourteen workers to be laid off in the duration. This was followed by the distillery going into receivership, with it being purchased by the Kirkleavington Property Company in 1978, it opened again between 1979 and 1981. In the 1980s, the warehouses were sold off for conversion into flats, and as such maturation no longer takes place on site. It closed again until 1989, and in 1991 it was purchased by Burn Stewart Distillers for ¬£600,000 plus ¬£200,000 for stock. Burn Stewart Distillers were bought out by Trinidad-based CL Financial for ¬£49 million in 2002, including the distillery at Tobermory and Deanston. It remains the only whisky distillery on the Isle of Mull, in the main village of Tobermory at the northern tip of the island. Tobermory is known for the variety of colours that the houses of the shore front are painted in and for being the location of the children's television show Balamory. The distillery itself is located at the foot of a steep hill, at the head of the bay. In 2012, during the driest summer for thirty years, the distillery was forced to halt production temporarily, to preserve the quality and consistency of its whisky. Early the following year, following several further months of unusually dry weather, there was another temporary halt to production. On each occasion, the water level in the small, private loch used to supply water to the distillery had dipped to such an extent that proper rainfall was needed to replenish it to a satisfactory level. In 2013 Burn Stewart was bought by Distell Group Limited of South Africa. Production Stills at the Tobermory distillery The Tobermory Single Malt is distilled from unpeated malted barley and matured in oak casks for at least ten years. A heavily peated whisky is also produced, but in small quantities, named Ledaig after the original distillery name. The malts are used in a number of blends including Scottish Leader and Black Bottle. The water for the distillery comes from a private loch near to the Mishnish lochs. The branding had been confused under previous owners, with the Tobermory brand being used for both a single malt and a blended whisky. Production was upgraded in 1990, with the distillery becoming capable of producing a million litres of spirit a year. It uses a traditional copper-domed cast iron mash tun, four washbacks made of Oregon pine, and four spirit stills. The whisky is matured in both former bourbon whiskey and sherry casks. Maturation takes place at the distillery at Deanston.

Established in 1718 in what was then the British Province of New Jersey, it is a member of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and is the oldest religious congregation in Morris County. The congregation's current building, constructed in 1835, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The earliest record of the church is a deed dated September 2, 1718, from John Richard, \\"Schoolmaster,\\" for three and a half acres of land adjoining the Whippany River, \\"in consideration of ye love, good will, and affection which I have and do bear towards my Christian friends and neighbors in Whippany,\\" \\"and especially of those who shall or may mutually covenant by subscription to erect a decent and suitable meeting house for the public worship of God.\\" Due to long traveling distance and population increasing, \\"so-called\\" sister churches emerged in Morristown, Madison, and Parsippany. The Hanover Church was then rebuilt in 1755 near its current location. The church stood slightly east of the present building and parallel to the roadway. It served as a hospital during the Revolution when an epidemic of smallpox broke out among the soldiers quartered in and around Morristown. It has been said that Washington and his staff occupied the manse which is now remodeled and still stands a bit beyond and across the street from the present manse. In 1835 the current church building was constructed from timbers from an old building and oak trees from the surrounding property. A few of the timbers in the edifice bear the marks of the hooks which suspended the cots when the old building was used as a hospital during the Revolution. The belfry was constructed in accordance with a design by the architect, Sir Christopher Wren. Adjacent to the church property is a small cemetery. The cemetery contains many historic grave sites. One of the oldest graves is that of Ruth Burnet, 1750. The other grave sites are that of 52 soldiers, 38 from the Revolutionary War, 3 from the War of 1812, 8 from the Civil War, 1 from World War I and 2 from World War II.

It produces and maintains the Getty controlled vocabulary databases, Art and Architecture Thesaurus, Union List of Artist Names, and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. They are compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction. The Getty vocabularies are the premiere references for categorizing works of art, architecture, material culture, and the names of artists, architects, and geographic names. They have been the life work of many people and continue to be critical contributions to cultural heritage information management and documentation.Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC) news release about Getty Vocabularies They contain terms, names, and other information about people, places, things, and concepts relating to art, architecture, and material culture. They can be accessed online free of charge on the Getty website. Usage The Getty vocabularies can be used in three ways: at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials; as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; and as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources. The Getty vocabularies are available in MARC format for easy mapping.Journal of Digital Information, vol. 4, no. 4 (2004) The Getty Vocabulary Program has been active within the library community, offering training on thesaurus construction and training on contributing via Getty online webforms. These opportunities are held during annual conferences of organizations such as Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS), Visual Resources Association (VRA), American Library Association (ALA), International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), NFAIS, Society of American Archivists (SAA), and Museum Computer Network (MCN). History Editorial work has been managed by the Getty since 1983. In 1987 the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, now known as the Getty Vocabulary Program, which was within the Getty Information Institute. The data is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the Vocabularies are maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. They are now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. Since 1998, Getty Information Technology Services and Web Services have worked closely with the Getty Vocabulary Program to conceive, develop, deploy, and continuously enhance the technologies necessary to support the growth and usage of the vocabulary databases. Three major projects comprise the work completed to date. First, the Vocabulary Coordination System (VCS) project created a single production system that replaced three separate, outdated and disparate data collection and editorial systems that had been used to produce the three vocabularies. The new, more powerful production engine allows Getty staff to efficiently collect, analyze, edit, merge and distribute terminology from Getty departments, as well as from external collaborating institutions. Second, the Vocabularies on the Web project produced unified Web-based access to the three Getty vocabularies and made them available to hundreds of thousands of researchers, scholars, and members of the general public who are interested in the subject areas covered by the vocabularies. This project also enhanced security to protect the Getty's intellectual property, and added measurement metrics to allow the Getty to gauge the usage volume, usage patterns, and the success of these efforts. Finally, the Vocabulary Contributions project created processes and procedures for making use of and contributing to the vocabulary databases an integral part of the work in all relevant Getty and external projects.Computerworld Honors Case Study 2007 In 2000, the Getty Vocabulary Program was moved from its Santa Monica office to its current location within the Getty Research Institute at the Getty Center.

She is the founder of the blog Skepchick and former co-host of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast. She also previously co-hosted the Little Atoms podcast. Career Watson blogs about atheism and feminist politics, and has been particularly active in critiquing the modern atheist movement (sometimes called \\"New Atheism\\") from within, especially regarding the lack of attention given to the role of women in the movement. Primarily active online, she was described by BuzzFeed as \\"the first major atheist whose rise has occurred on the web\\". =Skepchick= Watson founded the blog Skepchick in 2005, describing it as \\"an organization dedicated to promoting skepticism and critical thinking among women around the world\\". The same year, Watson released The Skepchick Calendar, a pin-up calendar featuring pictures of skeptical women for every month. Proceeds provided the attendance fee for several female applicants to attend the James Randi Educational Foundation's The Amaz!ng Meeting. Originally the site consisted of a forum and a monthly online magazine, Skepchick Magazine, which was launched in January 2006. In February 2006, Watson created a blog titled Memoirs of a Skepchick, as an addition to the magazine. Eventually the blog, now simply titled Skepchick, became the main site, as Skepchick Magazine was discontinued in July 2006. In 2010, Skepchick partnered with the Women Thinking Free Foundation to host a vaccination drive with the help of the \\"Hug Me!\\" campaign at the Dragon*Con convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Public health staff allowed members of the public to receive a TDAP vaccination free of charge, as well as educational literature promoting immunization. In 2011, Skepchick, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), and the Women Thinking Free Foundation partnered to offer a similar vaccination clinic at The Amaz!ng Meeting 9 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Skepchick was the 2012 winner of The Ockham Awards for Best Skeptic Blog. The site, whose stated goal is \\"to discuss women's issues from a skeptical standpoint\\", has a focus on science and skepticism in general rather than atheism in particular. , the site hosts over 20 bloggers from around the world. =The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe= Watson's first appearance on the podcast The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe was on episode 33 (March 9, 2006), where she was interviewed about her work on Skepchick. She returned on episode 36 (March 29, 2006) as a regular member of the panel. On December 27, 2014, she announced that she had recorded her final show prior to leaving the organization. =Public Radio Talent Quest= In May 2007, Watson entered the Public Radio Talent Quest, a contest aimed to find new public radio hosts. The contest reported receiving more than 1,400 entries. Watson's entries won the popular vote in every round, and she was declared one of three winners who each would receive $10,000 to produce a public radio pilot. Watson's pilot, Curiosity, Aroused, was an hour-long program focused on science and skepticism. It featured interviews with Richard Saunders of Australian Skeptics and Mystery Investigators, and Richard Wiseman, author of Quirkology and Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. She also investigated claims of poisonous amounts of lead in lipstick, went on a ghost tour in Boston and visited a Psychic Fair. Her show was the only one among the three winners not to receive funding by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for being turned into a one-year show. =\\"\\"= NECSS 2011 The controversy that came to be known as \\"Elevatorgate\\" originated with a video Watson made following the June 2011 World Atheist Convention in Dublin, where Watson spoke on a panel, which also included biologist Richard Dawkins, about her experience of being sexualized within the atheist movement on account of her gender. According to Watson, several members of the panel and audience later gathered for drinks in the hotel bar, which Watson left at around , saying she was going to bed. In a vlog posted following her return from the trip, she described how a man from the group, whom she had not spoken to before, followed her into an elevator and, once inside, asked her to go back to his room for coffee. Watson said this proposition being made in the confined space of an elevator made her \\"incredibly uncomfortable\\" and advised, \\"guys, don't do that\\". She went on to say: A negative response by the online atheist community to Watson's account of the elevator incident, which was a brief part of a longer video about other topics, soon spread across several websites, including Reddit, and became highly polarized and heated. Writer and biologist PZ Myers wrote a post on his blog Pharyngula about the incident, and the debate steadily grew to include the overall status of women within the secular movement, with most of the movements's prominent figures offering their opinion on whether the elevator incident was sexual harassment. Scholar of religion Stephen LeDrew writes that this discussion attracted \\"a continuing vitriolic backlash\\", with commenters online labeling women who spoke up on the subject as \\"feminazis\\" and other misogynistic slurs. Watson experienced death threats, with commenters on her blog saying in graphic terms that she should be raped and murdered. The controversy attracted mainstream media attention when Dawkins joined the debate. Writing in the comments section of Pharyngula, he satirized the supposed indifference of Western feminists to the plight of oppressed Muslim women: After there were a number of comments criticizing Dawkins, he went on to explain that, in his view, Watson had not suffered any injury, comparing Watson's experience with the annoyance one might feel while riding an elevator with someone chewing gum. Several commentators argued that this showed Dawkins' insensitivity to gender-related issues such as sexual violence. LeDrew writes that \\"For the first time since the New Atheism had risen to prominence, [Dawkins] found himself under attack by many of those who had viewed him as a respected leader\\". David Allen Green criticized Dawkins for dismissing lesser wrongs because bigger wrongs exist. Steven Tomlins and Lori G. Beaman argue that the incident highlights a schism within atheism over the role of feminism, some saying it should take a prominent place in the movement and others calling it divisive. Watson said of Dawkins, \\"to have my concernsand more so the concerns of other women who have survived rape and sexual assaultdismissed thanks to a rich white man comparing them to the plight of women who have been mutilated, is insulting to all of us\\". She stated that she would no longer buy or endorse his books and lectures, writing: The result of this exchange led to an extended internet flame war that several reports dubbed \\"Elevatorgate\\". In the wake of this and an incident at a Center for Inquiry-sponsored event, where female atheists reported gender bias and inappropriate behavior, organizations including the Richard Dawkins Foundation have reviewed their policies regarding sexual harassment and non-discrimination. Dawkins later apologized, stating, \\"There should be no rivalry in victimhood, and I'm sorry I once said something similar to American women complaining of harassment, inviting them to contemplate the suffering of Muslim women by comparison\\", in response to which Watson tweeted, \\"Richard Dawkins just did the blog-equivalent of coughing into his hand while mumbling 'sorry' to me. Eh, I'll take it.\\" Personal life Watson grew up in New Jersey and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in communications from Boston University in 2002. While attending Boston University, Watson worked as a magician. Watson says she \\"had relatively little serious interest in science\\" during her high school and college years but became more interested in science after being a magician and meeting with people like James Randi. On July 11, 2009, she and Sid Rodrigues were married in a surprise ceremony during The Amaz!ng Meeting 7. On April 8, 2011, she announced that she and Rodrigues were separated and seeking a divorce.

Given a query and a collection of documents that match the query, the problem is to rank, that is, sort, the documents in according to some criterion so that the \\"best\\" results appear early in the result list displayed to the user. Ranking in terms of information retrieval is an important concept in computer science and is used in many different applications such as search engine queries and recommender systems. A majority of search engines use ranking algorithms to provide users with accurate and relevant results. History The notion of page rank dates back to the 1940s and the idea originated in the field of economics. In 1941 Wassily Leontief developed an iterative method of valuing a country‚Äôs sector based on the importance of other sectors that supplied resources to it. In 1965, Charles H Hubbell at the University of California, Santa Barbara, published a technique for determining the importance of individuals based on the importance of the people who endorse them. Gabriel Pinski and Francis Narin came up with an approach to rank journals. Their rule was that a journal is important if it is cited by other important journals. Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University, developed an almost identical approach to PageRank which was called Hypertext Induced Topic Search or HITS and it treated web pages as ‚Äúhubs‚Äù and ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù. Google‚Äôs PageRank algorithm was developed in 1998 by Google‚Äôs founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and it is a key part of Google‚Äôs method of ranking web pages in search results. All the above methods are somewhat similar as all of them exploit the structure of links and require an iterative approach. Ranking models Ranking functions are evaluated by a variety of means; one of the simplest is determining the precision of the first k top-ranked results for some fixed k; for example, the proportion of the top 10 results that are relevant, on average over many queries. IR models can be broadly divided into three types: Boolean models or BIR, Vector Space Models, and Probabilistic Models. =Boolean Models= Boolean Model or BIR is a simple baseline query model where each query follow the underlying principles of relational algebra with algebraic expressions and where documents are not fetched unless they completely match with each other. Since the query is either fetch the document (1) or doesn‚Äôt fetch the document (0), there is no methodology to rank them. =Vector Space Model= Since the Boolean Model only fetches complete matches, it doesn‚Äôt address the problem of the documents being partially matched. The Vector Space Model solves this problem by introducing vectors of index items each assigned with weights. The weights are ranged from positive (if matched completely or to some extent) to negative (if unmatched or completely oppositely matched) if documents are present. Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) is one of the most popular techniques where weights are terms (e.g. words, keywords, phrases etc.) and dimensions is number of words inside corpus. The similarity score between query and document can be found by calculating cosine value between query weight vector and document weight vector using cosine similarity. Desired documents can be fetched by ranking them according to similarity score and fetched top k documents which has the highest scores or most relevant to query vector. =Probabilistic Model= In probabilistic model, probability theory has been used as a principal means for modeling the retrieval process in mathematical terms. The probability model of information retrieval was introduced by Maron and Kuhns in 1960 and further developed by Roberston and other researchers. According to Spack Jones and Willett (1997): The rationale for introducing probabilistic concepts is obvious: IR systems deal with natural language, and this is too far imprecise to enable a system to state with certainty which document will be relevant to a particular query. The model applies the theory of probability to information retrieval (An event has a possibility from 0 percent to 100 percent of occurring). i.e, in probability model, relevance is expressed in terms of probability. Here, documents are ranked in order of decreasing probability of relevance. It takes into the consideration of uncertainty element in the IR process. i.e., uncertainty about whether documents retrieved by the system are relevant to a given query. The probability model intends to estimate and calculate the probability that a document will be relevant to a given query based on some methods. The ‚Äúevent‚Äù in this context of information retrieval refers to the probability of relevance between a query and document. Unlike other IR models, the probability model does not treat relevance as an exact miss-or-match measurement. The model adopts various methods to determine the probability of relevance between queries and documents. Relevance in the probability model is judged according to the similarity between queries and documents. The similarity judgment is further dependent on term frequency. Thus, for a query consisting of only one term (B), the probability that a particular document (Dm) will be judged relevant is the ratio of users who submit query term (B) and consider the document (Dm) to be relevant in relation to the number of users who submitted the term (B). As represented in Maron‚Äôs and Kuhn‚Äôs model, can be represented as the probability that users submitting a particular query term (B) will judge an individual document (Dm) to be relevant. According to Salton and McGill , the essence of this model is that if estimates for the probability of occurrence of various terms in relevant documents can be calculated, then the probabilities that a document will be retrieved, given that it is relevant, or that it is not, can be estimated. Several experiments have shown that the probabilistic model can yield good results. However, such results have not been sufficiently better than those obtained using the Boolean or Vector Space model. Chu, H. Information Representation and Retrieval in the Digital Age. New Delhi: Ess Ess Publication. G.G.Choudhary. Introduction to Modern Information Retrieval. Facet Publishing. Evaluation Measures The most common measures of evaluation are precision, recall, and f-score. They are computed using unordered sets of documents. These measures must be extended, or new measures must be defined, in order to evaluate the ranked retrieval results that are standard in modern search engines. In a ranked retrieval context, appropriate sets of retrieved documents are naturally given by the top k retrieved documents. For each such set, precision and recall values can be plotted to give a precision-recall curve. =Precision= Precision measures the exactness of the retrieval process. If the actual set of relevant documents is denoted by I and the retrieved set of documents is denoted by O, then the precision is given by: \\\\text{Precision}=\\\\frac{{\\\\text{I}}\\\\cap{\\\\text{O}}}{{\\\\text{O}}} =Recall= Recall is a measure of completeness of the IR process. If the actual set of relevant documents is denoted by I and the retrieved set of documents is denoted by O, then the recall is given by: \\\\text{Recall}=\\\\frac{{\\\\text{I}}\\\\cap{\\\\text{O}}}{{\\\\text{I}}} =F1 Score= F1 Score tries to combine the precision and recall measure. It is the harmonic mean of the two. If P is the precision and R is the recall then the F-Score is given by: :F_1 = 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{P} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{R}}{\\\\mathrm{P} + \\\\mathrm{R}} Page Rank Algorithm The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on the links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided among all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value. The formulae is given below: :PR(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in B_u} \\\\frac{PR(v)}{L(v)} i.e. the PageRank value for a page u is dependent on the PageRank values for each page v contained in the set Bu (the set containing all pages linking to page u), divided by the number L(v) of links from page v. HITS Algorithm Similar to PageRank, HITS uses Link Analysis for analyzing the relevance of the pages but only works on small sets of subgraph (rather than entire web graph) and it‚Äôs query dependent. The subgraphs are ranked according to weights in hubs and authorities where pages that ranks highest is fetched and displayed.

Carl Eugen Langen (9 October 1833 in Cologne ‚Äì 2 October 1895 in Elsdorf) was a German entrepreneur, engineer and inventor, involved in the development of the petrol engine and the Wuppertal Suspension Railway. In 1857 he worked in his father's sugar factory, JJ Langen & S√∂hne, and after extensive technical training at the Polytechnic institute in Karlsruhe, patented a method for producing sugar cubes. He sold this method in 1872 to Sir Henry Tate of England, founder of the Tate Gallery in London. Otto and Langen In 1864, Langen met Nicolaus August Otto who was working to improve to the gas engine invented by Belgian Etienne Lenoir. The technically‚Äìtrained Langen recognized the potential of Otto's development, and one month after the meeting, founded the first engine factory in the world, NA Otto & Cie. At the 1867 Paris World Exhibition, their improved engine received the Grand Prize. Deutz After this first factory went bankrupt, Langen founded a new company for the construction of gas engines, Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz, which later became the group Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD).Wise, David Burgess. \\"Daimler: Founder of the Four-Wheeler\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.483, subscription required. This became the current Deutz AG. Langen invented and applied new methods of production in the KHD factory. Railway equipment In the field of rail transport equipment, Langen was co-owner and engineer of the Cologne Waggonfabrik van der Zypen & Charlier. He started the suspension railway system in Wuppertal in 1894. See also * In the German Empire, Eugen Langen was a leading entrepreneur in the sugar and motor industry in Cologne and the Rhineland. Eugen Langen was born on October 9th, 1833 in Cologne. He was the fifth of six sons of the factory owner Johann Jakob Langen (1794-1869), who ran a sugar refinery in Cologne (Johann Jakob Langen & S√∂hne) and the Friedrich-Wilhelms-H√ºtte near Siegburg (since 1855 Siegrheinischer Bergwerks- und H√ºttenverein). After dropping out of his studies in chemical or chemical engineering and mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic in Karlsruhe, Eugen Langen also developed entrepreneurial talent. After temporary holdings, he joined his father's factories in 1858, which he continued after his father's death. In 1870, together with Emil Pfeifer (1806-1889), he founded the Pfeifer & Langen sugar factory in Elsdorf (Rhein-Erft district) and intensified the cultivation of beet sugar in the Rhineland through an affiliated agricultural department. The processing of beet sugar instead of the refining of imported colonial or raw sugar was a major innovation in the second half of the 19th century. With the addition of a refinery in 1880, Pfeifer & Langen was the first company in the Rhineland to benefit from the so-called campaign, the Beet harvest from October to December of each year, independently and was able to produce white household sugar all year round. In addition to other patented inventions, it was the process for producing sugar cubes that made Langen famous beyond the borders of the Rhine area. Langen's connection with engine developer Nicolaus August Otto was also of great entrepreneurial and technical importance. In 1864 Langen and Otto founded the company ‚ÄúN. A. Otto & Cie \\", which in 1872 in the\\" Gas engine factory Deutz A.G. \\" (today Deutz AG, Cologne) was renamed. In 1876, Otto brought the concept of a four-stroke engine (\\"Otto engine\\") he had been pursuing for years to patent maturity. Langen's financial opportunities stemming from the sugar industry and his father's legacy made him and his brothers major investors in the gas engine factory; For many years, Langen was a member of the Executive Board and played a key role in the management and industrial exploitation of Otto engines, and it was not least on his initiative that he collaborated with the two technicians Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900) and Wilhelm Maybach (1846-1929), who later worked for Daimler -Motoren-Gesellschaft in Stuttgart (today Daimler AG) made a career, back in the early days of the Deutz gas engine factory. In addition to the sugar lump and the Otto engine, Eugen Langen is always associated with the suspension railway, a single-track suspension railway system designed by him, which was only put into operation in Wuppertal in 1901, as the underground railways were preferred at the turn of the century: ‚ÄúThe Suspension railway is in the air / If only the project doesn't fizzle out / And doesn't run away as a sweet madness / The high- altitude suspension railway \\"caricatured the\\" Lustige Bl√§tter \\"in its 17th edition in 1895. Langen was also involved in a large number of supervisory boards in the electrical and transport industry as well as in banks and insurance companies (e.g. Badische Schrauben-Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft, Mannheim; Electrizit√§ts-Actien-Gesellschaft vorm. Schuckert & Co., Nuremberg; A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein , Cologne; Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Bodenkreditbank, Cologne; Colonia Feuerversicherungsgesellschaft, Cologne). In the electrical industry in particular, he was interested in the electrification of industrial companies and cities in connection with the gas engine. Eugen Langen was a representative of his branch of industry in the respective economic associations. As an association member of the beet sugar industry and the refining industry - partly in chairmanship - he argued for a merger of both branches of production in the face of increasing overproduction of sugar and falling prices. In 1892 the Rhenish refineries merged to form the first syndicate. In 1900, five years after Langen's death, the first all- German sugar cartel was formed from beet sugar manufacturers and refiners. Because of his commitment to a generally applicable patent law, he was called \\"Patent-Langen\\". As recently as 1850, around 90 percent of all patents in Prussia had been rejected, and patented inventions usually only had a term of protection of three years. A patent was valid for that Time for the free trade-oriented circles of Prussia as a restriction of free commercial rights of use. Eugen Langen therefore campaigned for patent protection at the beginning of the 1870s in the Cologne district of the Association of German Engineers (VDI). Werner von Siemens (1816-1892) became an important participant in Berlin. On the basis of the drafts of the VDI, the government passed a German patent law in 1877, which since then has provided for a 15-year patent period. Politically conservative, Langen also supported the colonial-political endeavors of the German East African Society, the German Colonial Society and the undertakings of his later son-in-law Hermann von Wissmann (1853-1905) to explore the East African lakes (Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika). In addition, Langen emerged as a church building sponsor in Cologne and Elsdorf. In Cologne, he promoted the construction of the Protestant Christ Church at the Stadtgarten, in which he - also in his capacity as city councilor - vigorously campaigned for the acquisition of a corresponding piece of land and accompanied the architectural competition and the construction. For the Christ Church, he donated the font made by the sculptor Heinrich Renard (1868-1928). In Elsdorf, he had the church in the Zieverich district, consecrated in 1895, built: the property, a foundation and a loan came from him, his son Gottlieb took over the construction management. The aim was to give the evangelical workers of Pfeifer & Langen a religious home. Langen was married twice. His first wife Henriette (1834-1872), daughter of the Basel paper manufacturer Andreas Thurneysen, died giving birth to their tenth child. His second marriage was to his niece Hermine Schleicher (1849-1935). He had a total of thirteen children, including Eugen Gottlieb von Langen (1896-1982), 1958-1965 President of the Cologne Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Hans Rudolf von Langen (1863-1935), who with Robert Gerling helped found his insurance company , and Arnold Langen (1876-1947), who initiated the merger of the Deutz gas engine factory and the Humboldt mechanical engineering company. Eugen Langen died shortly before his 62nd birthday on October 2nd, 1895 as a result of food poisoning at Gut Etzweiler near Elsdorf. He was buried in the family grave in the Melaten cemetery in Cologne. In the Marienburg district of Cologne, a street and in front of the Deutz train station a memorial of the first atmospheric gas engine from 1864, the forerunner of the four-stroke Otto engine, remind of Eugen Langen. He received another honor in November 1990 when he was included in the figure program of the Cologne Council Tower (sculptor: Theo Heiermann.)

The waters of the Dreisam feed the famous Freiburg B√§chle runnels. Geography The Dreisam originates in the Dreisam valley (Dreisamtal) which is located in the Southern Black Forest (S√ºdschwarzwald). The origin of the river can be found close to a bridge on the Landesstra√üe 127 which leads from Kirchzarten to Stegen. Here, two streams, the Rotbach and Wagensteinbach, meet to form the Dreisam river. This confluence is located in the western part of the Southern Black Forest Nature Park below the so-called H√∂llental, where the Rotchbach flows through, and the Wagensteigtal. From there on the Dreisam, which was canalized, flows towards the west and reaches Freiburg at the eastern end of Ebnet. Along the way the Dreisam meets the Krummbach and Brugga, two streams originating south of the Dreisam, as well as the Eschbach stream which flows north of the Dreisam. The river leaves the Black Forest at the Freiburg soccer stadium called Schwarzwald-Stadion and continues flowing westwards. In the eastern part of the city, water is withdrawn from the river at Sandfang. It is used to supply the Gewerbekanal, an industrial canal, and the famous Freiburg B√§chle with water. A division of the river into a northern and southern branch takes place in the historic city center. The majority of the southern branch flows back into the Dreisam directly west of the H√∂llentalbahnbr√ºcke bridge which is located in the St√ºhlinger district. The remaining water runs through the areas Eschholz and Bischofslinde towards the west and ultimately flows back into the Dreisam near Lehen. The northern branch of the river runs often subterraneously through the northwestern historic center of the districts Beurbarung and Br√ºhl and flows westwards of Gundelfingen into Schobbach. Schobbach then again leads into the Glotter at Nimburg-Bottingen. As a result, the Freiburger B√§chlewasser flows into the Dreisam only shortly before Riegel. In the urban area of Freiburg, the Dreisam itself runs in northwestern direction along the B31. After crossing under the A5 the river flows through March, at the eastern edge of the Kaiserstuhl as well as the western edge of Nimberg towards Riegel, where it leads into the Elz. From 1817 to 1842 the Dreisam was canalized in its whole length from Kirchzarten to Riegel under the leadership of Johann Gottfried Tulla. However it should be renaturalized in the east of Freiburg at a length of 800m. It overcomes 199m height, from Kirchzarten (337m NHN) until its mouth into the Elz (178m) at Riegel. 135m above or southwards of the river mouth the Glotter leads into the Dreisam, coming from south-southeastern. Northeastern of St. Michaelsberg (241 m NHN), the Alte Dreisam, from south-southwestern, flows into the direct mouth of Dreisam and Elz. Floods The 15 km long Leopoldskanal branches off right below the confluence of the earlier mentioned Elz. This canal is used to drain water to the Rhine if the Dreisam has high-water. The canal ends north-west of Rheinhausen, south-west of Rust and west of the Naturschutzgebiet Taubergie√üen. The Dreisam's catchment area is especially prone to flooding due to the steep typography and the climatically and orographically high precipitation. From the Feldberg to the Pegel Ebnet the average slope is at 21¬∞ or rather 43% downhill grade. Because of its round shape the area has a high aspect ratio of 0.7 and a high circularity ratio of 0.55 which leads to temporal runoff concentration and thus can quickly lead to flooding. The aquifer, which consists primarily of solid rock, absorbs little water and hence leads to quick drainage, particularly in cases of heavy rainfall. Because of melting snow and heavy rainfalls in spring, the maximum amount of draining water runs off in April. Even though the heaviest rainfalls occur in summer, the high water consumption of the local vegetation only leads to secondary drainage maximums. In March 1896 a historic flood killed two people and destroyed several bridges. Among the people that were killed was Carl Siegel, a German jurist. Nowadays floods do usually not cause major damages since the Dreisam was secured on both sides through walls and channelized from Freiburg onward. However, on December 23, 1991 there was a flood that caused damage in the eastern part of Freiburg. The riverside paths below the bridges of the Mannheim-Basel-Karlsruhe-railway, called Rheintalbahn in German, are often flooded during high water. Even though warning signs were installed along the path, two cyclists died there in 2010 and 2013 during a flood. In order to prevent accidents like this, the city is planning to install boom gates along the path. Drainage basin and tributaries The drainage basin of the Dreisam as far as Riegel covers 568 km¬≤. In Germany it is therefore characterized as a drainage basin of medium size. The drainage system of the Dreisam has many branches and can be characterized as a complex first degree river regime which is marked by two major discharges. A maximum discharges can be measured in spring as a result of melting snow. Another major discharge can also be measured in summer or fall depending on when it is raining the most. There are a couple of rivers that coalesce with the Dreisam, which are the headwater streams Rotbach and Wagensteigbach and (ordered towards downstream): Krummbach (which is also called Zastler Bach in the upper section), Brugga, Eschbach and Glotter. Usage The waters of the Dreisam used to drive mills and such yield energy for industrial establishments like gem grinderies and tanneries. Today there are still small river power stations like at the Sandfang. In the past, people even caught salmon in the Dreisam, today however, the fishery does no longer have any importance. Nowadays, the Dreisam with its bank paths and meadows serves as a recreational to take walks, refreshing swims or have barbecues. The Dreisam is also of significance in the matter of individual traffic since on the south bank there are bikeways and on both sides motorways that lead to the city center of Freiburg and the ‚ÄúZubringer Mitte‚Äù (highway 31a) to Beratzhausen. Since 2011, the Dreisam is also used at the venue of an annual duck race fund-raiser that starts in Freiburg's city center. Thousands of numbered rubber ducks are tossed into the river and flow a few hundred meters upstream before being fished out again.  References   Literature  * Lange, J√∂rg (2007).

Typically, this means coordinating directly with the people responsible for producing the news and features in the mass media. The goal of media relations is to maximize positive coverage in the mass media without paying for it directly through advertising. Many people use the terms public relations and media relations interchangeably; however, doing so is incorrect. Media relations refer to the relationship that a company or organization develops with journalists, while public relations extend that relationship beyond the media to the general public.Jane, Johnston. Media Relations: Issues and Strategies. 1st ed. Sydney, Australia: Allen & Unwin Academic, 2008. It is possible for communication between the media and the organization to be initiated by either side. However dealing with the media presents unique challenges in that the news media cannot be controlled ‚Äî they have ultimate control over whether stories pitched to them are of interest to their audiences.Ridgway, Judy. Practical Media Relations Because of this fact, ongoing relationships between an organization and the news media are vital. One way to ensure a positive working relationship with media personnel is to become deeply familiar with their \\"beats\\" and areas of interests.Cutuli, Carmelo. Media Relations. Il metodo americano Media relations and public relations practitioners should read as many magazines, journals, newspapers, and blogs as possible, as they relate to one's practice. Organizations often compile what is known as a media list, or a list of possible media outlets who may be interested in an organization's information. The media can consist of thousands of magazine publications, newspapers, and TV and radio stations. Therefore, when a \\"newsworthy\\" event occurs in an organization, a media list can assist in determining which media outlet may be the most interested in a particular story.Ridgway, Judy. Practical Media RelationsAldershot: Gower, 1996. Working with the media on behalf of an organization allows for awareness of the entity to be raised as well as the ability to create an impact with a chosen audience. It allows access to both large and small target audiences and helps in building public support and mobilizing public opinion for an organization.Jane, Johnston. Media Relations: Issues and Strategies. 1st ed. Sydney, Australia: Allen & Unwin Academic, 2008. This is all done through a wide range of media and can be used to encourage two-way communication. Possible reasons an organization may reach out to the media are:Ridgway, Judy. Practical Media Relations. Aldershot: Gower, 1996. *Launch of a new product/service *Initiation of new factories/offices *Financial results *Organization sponsored events or awards *Launch of organization promotional campaigns *Recent disasters, strikes or organizational closures *Awards/accolades for the company *Visits from company dignitaries/celebrities *Involvement in local/community activities *Community engagement  Media Relations and Information Subsidy Information Subsidy consists of information that is provided to the press as supplemental material to help present their reporting. This includes information such as press releases, advertisements and videos of related news events. An advantage of using information subsidies is that they can decrease or eliminate the need for completing additional research on the part of the media. Subsidies can be a good source of information for the media, however, it is important that the media vet the source for accuracy and bias. By presenting ready-to-publish data, information subsidies can save journalists time and money. A study completed in 1999 estimated that nearly half of the information reported in newspapers came from information subsidies. Yet another survey suggested that most of the information received by journalists is never published. Trust in the source and content of the data are the criteria journalists use when determining whether or not they will use the material provided.  Media Relations and Public Relations Practitioners (PR) Media and Public Relations Practitioners are very similar in many ways. Both parties aim to share information with the public. This information is intended to benefit the public by educating them on news and other events. Public Relations Practitioners attempt to expand their client's media coverage by staying up to date on news and current events that are relevant to their client. Because PR practitioners are usually focused on a client, some would argue that they are biased or attempt to sway public opinion. The media is constantly looking for a new story. PR practitioners are a good, reliable place for the media to go to for newsworthy events. They often provide newsworthy or public service data, which can save the media the time required to complete their own research and sourcing. The fact that PR specialists have been providing the news mass media with information for years has not really changed the trust level that the media has for the sources. Trust is a critical component between the media and PR practitioners and it must be present for their to be a successful working relationship. It has been said that part of the problem between journalists and PR Practitioners is the perception that PR Specialists have not been good at providing journalists with newsworthy material. Journalists should express their thoughts and concerns to these PR Specialists to allow for better communication and improvement of the type and quality of news data. As with any relationship, both parties must be committed to working together to achieve success.  Ethical Pitfalls The words ‚Äòfake news‚Äô bombard news outlets today. It is now more important than ever for Public Relations Practitioners to provide honest, truthful, and accurate information to the media. It is equally important that journalists themselves authenticate information that they have been given. There is much pressure for a Public Relations Practitioner to embellish the truth for their client to make news appear better than it really is. PR Practitioners could help the communication process by providing more detail about specific news. For example, if a client calls the recall of a product, the reason for the recall should be thoroughly explained. One way a PR Practitioner can avoid ethical issues is to be upfront with their clients and the media regarding any potential ethical issues. The pressure for a PR Practitioner can be great because of the need to work with multiple entities in order to produce their information. Having a basis for their personal and professional ethics will go a long way in helping a PR Practitioner. This basis should include considering the interests of themselves, the media, and the entity they are representing. Respect for those involved and social responsibility should also be an inherent part of ethics. Another approach to ethics is based on virtue. This includes learning from others, being prepared to take risks, and practicing complete honesty in their reporting.

I looked downtown. And people told me that I was crazy to open there.

The pier is long and located at the end of Manhattan Beach Boulevard. An octagonal Mediterranean-style building sits at the end of the pier and houses the Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab & Aquarium. Surfers usually can be seen below the pier. The pier includes the \\"Volleyball Walk of Fame,\\" featuring plaques dedicated to past winners of the Manhattan Beach Open beach volleyball tournament. The pier is popular with locals, tourists, photographers, and artists and for fishing. It offers sunsets and vantage points from the shore and hillside. History =Pre-history= In 1897, the Potencia Company was incorporated to develop land in the area and proposed a seaside resort with wharves and piers. The area was named Potencia, but the city of Manhattan was incorporated in 1912 with the word \\"Beach\\" being added in 1927. The name was chosen by land developer Stewart Merrill. A pier is believed to have been one of the first features built when the Manhattan Beach community was developed. Two wooden piers were built in 1901, one at Center Street (later renamed Manhattan Beach Boulevard) and one at Marine Avenue called Peck's Pier and Pavilion. The Center Street Pier was long and pylons were made by fastening three railroad rails together and driving them into the ocean floor. It supported a narrow wooden deck and wave motor to generate power for the Strand lighting system, but sources disagree about whether the system worked. Part of the wave motor may still be buried in the sands at the shore end of the present pier. This \\"old iron pier\\", as it was called, was destroyed by a major storm in 1913. =Current pier= The pier from Manhattan Beach Boulevard Lack of money, lawsuits, storms, World War I and debates about when and where to build another pier delayed Manhattan Beach from having a pier completed until 1920. Engineer A.L. Harris developed the concept of the circular end for less exposure and damage to the pilings by the waves. The pier was completed and dedicated on July 5, 1920. The next version built was a cement pier with a rounded end and it was long. Octagonal house that now holds a lunch restaurant was completed in 1922. In 1928, a wooden extension was added but it was destroyed in a storm in 1940. In 1991 the pier was restored to its 1920s appearance with a dedication ceremony in 1992. In 1928 the pier was extended out 200 feet (at no cost to the city) when a Captain Larsen of Redondo Beach offered to pay for an extension in exchange for the rights to run a shoreboat between the pier and his barge Georgina. On January 9, 1940, of the extension was ripped away during a winter storm. The extension was never repaired and the remaining section was swept away in February 1941. In 1946 the pier and adjoining beach were deeded over from the city of Manhattan Beach to the state. During the next four decades the pier would remain a focus of beachfront activity, but Mother Nature and old age took their toll and by the 1980s the pier was in sad shape and in need of renovation. Restoration took place in the early 1990s with a focus on retention of the old time appearance, much like Pier 7 in San Francisco. The original pier had to be fixed as old age and decay required extensive repair, and in fact made it unsafe by the late 1980s (when a jogger was injured by falling concrete). In 1995, the pier was declared a state historic landmark. It is the oldest standing concrete pier on the West Coast. It is managed by the County of Los Angeles, Department of Beaches and Harbors. Correction: The Pier is managed by the City of Manhattan Beach Public Works Attractions =Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab and Aquarium= The Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab and Aquarium is located at the end of the pier, and is free to the public. The Aquarium includes a shark tank, tide pool touch tank with animals common to Southern California, tanks with lobsters, and baby sharks as well as brightly colored, non-native fish and invertebrates. During the summer, the aquarium is open from 2PM to 5PM on weekdays and 10AM to sunset on weekends. During the rest of the year, it is open from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends. In January 2018, the aquarium was closed and construction began on a major renovation project. The sealife was relocated to a temporary structure near the entrance to the pier during the renovations. The aquarium reopened on November 5, 2018 with an all-new interior. The octagonal building includes a Spanish tile roof and large gooseneck reflectors to improve lighting. =Fishing= According to Pierfishing.com the sandy beach area yields the normal surf species; barred surfperch, croakers, small rays and guitarfish (shovelnose shark). The pier is especially known for its magnificent barred surfperch fishing. At times, anglers catch hundreds of them within an hour of time, using mainly small jigs and sandcrabs. The area around the pilings yields pileperch, walleye surfperch, silver surfperch, and other common pier species. Mid-pier, casting away from the pier, yields small tom cod (white croaker) and herring (queenfish), jacksmelt, yellowfin croaker and an occasional halibut. Action at the end of the pier is improved by the surrounding artificial reef which is located about from the end. Fish at the deepest water end include bonito, Pacific mackerel, jack mackerel, barracuda, an occasional white seabass or even yellowtail, and reef visitors like kelp bass, sand bass and sculpin (scorpionfish). The resident species in Santa Monica Bay may be dangerous to eat, but those that migrate in and out of the bay are considered safe to eat. A variety of baits are utilized. =Surfing= The pier played a significant role in the history of surfing. The pier was a popular spot for Southern California surfers in the 1940s, the early days of modern surfing. Dale Velzy, the first commercial surfboard shaper, started his business building and repairing boards under the pier before renting a nearby storefront in 1949, starting what is considered the first surf shop. In film It is used in *Point Break (1991) ‚Äì Keanu Reeves buys his surfboard from a shop located on the pier. *Starsky & Hutch (2004) ‚Äì Starsky (Ben Stiller), can be seen stretching under the pier. *Tequila Sunrise (1988) ‚Äì Mel Gibson's character lives on the beach near the pier. California Historical Landmark Marker California Historical Landmark Marker NO. 1018 at the site reads:californiahistoricallandmarks.com 1018, Manhattan Beach Pier *NO. 1018 MANHATTAN BEACH STATE PIER - Designed by City Engineer A.L. Harris, this pier was constructed by the City of Manhattan Beach during the years 1917-1920. The roundhouse building was added a year later. Harris' innovative design featured a rounded end to the pier, which helped it withstand the pounding of the Pacific. Although the roundhouse was reconstructed in 1989, the pier itself survives as Southern California's oldest remaining example of early reinforced concrete pier construction.

Plot summary The protagonist, Koyomi Morishita, is a short, clumsy, female high school freshman who is mercilessly teased except by her good friend Yumiko. Seeing a flyer about a school for magicians, Koyomi takes the enrollment exam and becomes a student of Misa Anehara, a powerful master magician. Modern magic is accomplished with the aid of computers by writing special programs for them. As magic is not as easy as it seems, initially Koyomi's talent seems to consist of making washbasins randomly fall out of the sky. Characters ; : :A bumbling 15-year-old first year high school student who has the body of a child. Since she is only 146 cm (4 ft 9¬Ω in) tall, she is often mistaken for an elementary school student when she is wearing her own clothes. She gets lousy grades, is not very athletic and doesn't really have anything about herself to brag about, so she decides to go to a magic school that she saw in a flyer in order to change herself. She has the unusual ability of being able to take any code (spell) and change it into a washbasin summoning code. This ability has gradually been improving. ; : :A natural-born 15-year-old mage, she has purple eyes and silver hair. She is quick-learned at magic, seeing a complex spell and repeating it perfectly, without practicing. She has a staff and a spell book left to her by her great- grandfather, and usually wears white. She was often teased at elementary school and stared at in public because of her doll-like appearance. Upon meeting Koyomi, they become good friends, but Yumiko often displays a somewhat of a tsundere-like personality towards her. ; : :She is one of the most powerful modern-magic users. She is a 25-year-old college student who is majoring in programming. She is able to make practical use of her abilities as a leading modern magic user. She has no qualms about using magic to manipulate the will of normal people and uses it to help people sell products. The flyer which Koyomi read was distributed by the magic school run by Misa's grandfather, and Misa becomes Koyomi's magic teacher because of this. She has a sweet and laid-back personality but lacks common sense. As a hobby, she likes to buy useless things such as banana hangers and curry roux meant for large establishments from the internet. Her mother died when she was young, so she raised her younger brother Soshiro. ; : :The class representative of Koyomi's class, she is quiet and a model student. She is a quick learner, compared to Koyomi, of modern magic. Although she is fairly skilled, she cannot see demons, ghostscripts, or genies because she cannot detect magic. ; : :The younger brother of Misa, he is more sensible and serious, compared to his sister. He is usually seen doing chores around the residence. He mostly scolds Misa because of her illogical actions, but he also deeply cares about her. Due to his sister constantly feeding him enchanted food at a young age, he has built an immunity to magic. As a result, he refuses to believe the existence of magic even after magic is shown to him.

When his father died of typhoid fever in 1892, his mother reverted to her maiden name and moved the family to Linn County, Oregon. When Hart was five years old his mother remarried, to Bill Barton, and the family moved to Edna's father's farm. Hart wrote later, in 1911, of his happiness during this time, when he was free to present as male, playing with boys' toys made for him by his grandfather. His parents and grandparents largely accepted and supported his gender expression, though his mother described his \\"desire to be a boy\\" as \\"foolish.\\" His grandparents' obituaries, from 1921 and 1924, both list Hart as a grandson. When Hart was 12 the family moved to Albany. There Hart was obliged to present as female to attend school, where he was treated as a girl.

He hated traditional girl tasks, preferring farm work with the menfolk instead. The self reliance that became a lifelong trait was evident early: once when he accidentally chopped off his fingertip with an axe, Hart dressed it himself, saying nothing about it to the family.\\" As a suppressed male during his school years, Hart was allowed to write essays under his chosen name \\"Robert Allen Bamford, Jr.\\" with little resistance from his classmates or teachers. It was common at the time for writers to use pseudonyms, including to assume names associated with the opposite gender. Hart published work in local newspapers and in school and college publications under this name, or as \\"submitted by an anonymous boy\\", or using the neutral \\"A.L.H.\\" or \\"A. Hart\\". He used his legal name only under pressure from peers or seniors. His early work dealt with masculine subjects, even when he was asked to write on topics about life as a woman. When asked to write about female classmates or friends he portrayed them as prize fighters or boyish basketball players. Hart (standing on right) as a part of editorial staff for college yearbook. Eva Cushman, Alan's college love. Hart attended Albany College (now Lewis & Clark College), then transferred with classmate and romantic partner Eva Cushman to Stanford University for the 1911‚Äì1912 school year before going back to Albany. Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health & Science University); during this period, Hart also returned to Northern California to attend courses in the summer of 1916 at the Stanford University School of Medicine, then located in San Francisco. Hart was deeply unhappy that the medical degree was issued in his female name, limiting his opportunities to use it in any future life under a male name. College records show that at least one of the senior staff was sympathetic; his graduation records were indexed internally as \\"Hart, Lucile (aka Robert L.), M.D.\\".Graduation details for \\"Hart, Lucille (aka Robert L.), M.D.\\" Oregon Health & Science University Historical Collections & Archives BIOGRAPHICAL FILES in Box 27 of the Licenses, Degrees, and Certificates Collection Nonetheless, Hart knew that if he presented himself as Robert, any prospective employer checking his credentials would discover the female name or find no records for him at all. After graduation he worked for a short while (presenting as a woman) at a Red Cross hospital in Philadelphia. Transition Upon reaching adulthood Hart sought psychiatric counselling and radical surgery to live as a man. Hart's was the first documented transgender male transition in the United States, though sex reassignment surgeries had been carried out earlier in Germany, including on one man, treated by German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who had won the right to serve in the German military.Sittengeschichte des Weltkrieges, in three vols. illustrated, edited by Magnus Hirschfeld, Verlag f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft Schneider & Co., Leipzig/Wien, 1930 (English edition ‚Äì abbreviated and without illustrations: The Sexual History of the World War, The Panurge Press, New York, 1934) The 1906/07 case of Karl M. Baer had set a new precedent for sex change surgery by enlisting simultaneous support from psychiatric, legal, and surgical quarters. There was now medical and legal precedent for transitioning; Hart's approach to his own transition appears to have drawn on the Baer case. In 1917, Hart approached Joshua Allen Gilbert, Ph.D., M.D., at the University of Oregon and requested surgery to eliminate menstruation and the possibility of ever becoming pregnant. He also presented Gilbert with a eugenic argument, that a person with \\"abnormal inversion\\" should be sterilized. Gilbert was initially reluctant, but accepted that Hart was \\"extremely intelligent and not mentally ill, but afflicted with a mysterious disorder for which I [Gilbert] have no explanation.\\" He accepted that Hart experienced himself only as a male, who described himself using phrases including \\"the other fellows and I\\" and asking \\"what could a fellow do?\\" Gilbert wrote, in case notes published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders in 1920, that \\"from a sociological and psychological standpoint she [Hart] is a man\\" and that living as one was Hart's only chance for a happy existence, \\"the best that can be done.\\" He added, \\"Let him who finds in himself a tendency to criticize to offer some constructive method of dealing with the problem on hand. He will not want for difficulties. The patient and I have done our best with it.\\" Early FTM surgeries involved the implanting of testicular tissue in place of the removed ovaries.Mentioned in Hirschfeld's notes in 1905 entitled Geschlechts- √úberg√§nge. Mischungen m√§nnlicher und weiblicher Geschlechtscharaktere (sexuelle Zwischenstufen) Crystalline male hormones had been extracted in usable quantities from male urine by 1903, but it represented an infection risk. Synthetic hormones were not manufactured until 1920 (by Bayer),Vgl. ebd., S.59, und Aus einem Jahrhundert Schering-Forschung: Pharma, hrsg. v. der Schering AG ‚Äì Scheringianum, Gert Wlasich u.a., Berlin 1991, S.26‚Äì31. and when given the opportunity, Hart underwent hormone therapy. Hart's surgery was completed at the University of Oregon Medical SchoolOHSU Fertility Clinic News (September 2006) in the University of Oregon Medical School Library over the 1917‚Äì1918 winter vacation. He then legally changed his name. He interned at San Francisco Hospital. A former classmate recognized him there, and he was outed as transgender in the Spokesman-Review newspaper on Feb. 6, 1918. The article's opening sentence referred to him by his birth name and with female pronouns, describing him as having graduated from Stanford \\"as a fluffy coed...[who] affected boyish mannerisms.\\" In February 1918 he married his first wife Inez Stark and moved with her to Gardiner, Oregon, to set up his own medical practice. In an interview with a local paper, Hart declared that he was \\"happier since I made this change than I ever have in my life, and I will continue this way as long as I live [...] I have never concealed anything regarding my [change] to men's clothing [...] I came home to show my friends that I am ashamed of nothing.\\" Life after transition In Oregon, Hart suffered an early blow when a former medical school classmate outed him as transgender, forcing Hart and his wife to move. Hart found the experience traumatic and again consulted Gilbert, who wrote that Hart had suffered from \\"the hounding process ... which our modern social organization can carry on to such perfection and refinement.\\" Hart set up a new practice in remote Huntley, Montana, writing later that he \\"did operations in barns and houses...('til) the crash of the autumn of 1920 wiped out most of the Montana farmers and stockmen, and me along with them\\". He then took itinerant work, until in 1921, on a written recommendation from noted doctor Harriet J. Lawrence (decorated by President Wilson for developing a flu vaccine), he secured a post as staff physician at Albuquerque Sanatorium. The relocations, financial insecurity, and secrecy placed strain on Hart's marriage, and Inez left him in September 1923. She ordered him to have no further contact with her, and divorced him in 1925. The same year Hart married his second wife, Edna Ruddick; the union lasted until the end of Hart's life. In 1925 Hart moved to the Trudeau School of Tuberculosis in New York, where he also carried out postgraduate work; he spent 1926‚Äì1928 as a clinician at the Rockford TB sanatorium in Illinois. In 1928 Hart obtained a master's degree in Radiology from the University of Pennsylvania; he was in 1929 appointed Director of Radiology at Tacoma General Hospital. During the 1930s the couple moved to Idaho, where Hart worked during the 1930s and early 1940s; his work also took him to Washington, where he held a research fellowship as a roentgenologist in Spokane. During the war Hart was also a medical adviser at the Army Recruiting and Induction headquarters in Seattle, while Edna worked for the King County Welfare Department in the same city. In 1948, after Hart obtained a master's degree in public health from Yale, the couple moved to Connecticut, where Hart had been appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. The couple lived for the rest of their lives in West Hartford, Connecticut, where Edna became a professor at the University of Hartford. After the Second World War synthetic testosterone became available in the US, and for the first time Hart was able to grow a beard and shave. He also developed a deeper voice, making him more confident and his public appearances easier. During the last six years of his life Hart gave numerous lectures, and dedicated all his free time to fundraising for medical research and to support patients with advanced TB who could not afford treatment. He was a member of the American Thoracic Society, American Public Health Association, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and American Civil Liberties Union, among many others. Socially, both he and Edna were well liked, active community leaders. Alan served for eight years as vice president for his local Unitarian Church council. Hart died of heart failure on July 1, 1962. The terms of his will directed his body be cremated and his ashes scattered over Puget Sound where he and Edna had spent many happy summers together. Hart said once, in a speech to graduating medical students, \\"Each of us must take into account the raw material which heredity dealt us at birth and the opportunities we have had along the way, and then work out for ourselves a sensible evaluation of our personalities and accomplishments\\". Tuberculosis research Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. Doctors, including Hart, were realizing that myriad illnesses‚Äîconsumption, phthisis, phthisis pulmonalis, Koch's disease, scrofula, lupus vulgaris, white plague, King's evil, Pott's disease, and Gibbus‚Äîwere all in fact cases of tuberculosis (TB). TB usually attacked victims' lungs first; Hart was among the first physicians to document how it then spread, via the circulatory system, causing lesions on the kidneys, spine, and brain, eventually resulting in death. Scientists had discovered in the nineteenth century that tuberculosis was not hereditary, but an airborne bacillus spread rapidly among persons in close proximity by coughing and sneezing. This meant it might be treated, but with no cure for the disease in its advanced stages the only hope for sufferers was early detection. X-rays, or Roentgen rays as they were more commonly known until World War Two, had been discovered only in 1895, when Hart was five years old. In the early twentieth century they were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray screening was invaluable for early detection. Even rudimentary early x-ray machines could detect the disease before it became critical. This allowed early treatment, often saving the patient's life. It also meant sufferers could be identified and isolated from the population, greatly lessening the spread of the disease. Public fund-raising drives, like the newly created Christmas Seal campaign, helped finance these efforts. By the time antibiotics were introduced in the 1940s, doctors using the techniques Hart developed had managed to cut the tuberculosis death toll down to one fiftieth. In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state's Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho's first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state's war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating the effects of the epidemic. An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word \\"tuberculosis\\" carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as \\"chest clinics\\", himself as a \\"chest doctor\\", and his patients as \\"chest patients\\". Discretion and compassion were important tools in treating the stigmatised disease. In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium, These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine (pub. Harper & Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish. In 1948 Hart was appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. As in Idaho, Dr. Hart took charge of a massive statewide x-ray screening program for TB, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment. He held this position for the rest of his life, and is credited with helping contain the spread of tuberculosis in Connecticut as he had previously in the Pacific Northwest. Similar programs based on his leadership and methodology in this field in other states also saved many thousands of lives.National Cyclopaedia of American Biography Fiction writing Alongside his medical practice and research, Hart pursued a second career as a novelist. He had in early life published in local, school, and college magazines, and later published four novels, chiefly on medical themes. His four novels incorporate semi- autobiographical themes: The Undaunted (1936) contains a doctor, Richard Cameron, who describes himself as a 'cripple' after his foot is amputated following persistent bone infection. Cameron worries that this physical defect will drive women away, but ends up marrying his sweetheart. A second character, a radiologist named Sandy Farquhar, is a gay man who has been harassed and tormented, driven from job to job, over his sexuality. Farquhar, who is short, thin, and bespectacled, resembles Hart physically, and considers himself \\"the possessor of a defective body\\" from which he wishes to escape‚Äîa typical asset of gender dysphoria. Another novel, In the Lives of Men, contains a gay male character with a missing arm. =Early short stories= These short stories were collected in The Life and Career of Alberta Lucille/Dr. Alan L. Hart, with collected early writings, by Brian Booth. 1908 Frankfort Center (Published in the Albany High School Whirlwind) For an assignment to write about female college members and sporting activities, Hart described the ambiguously-named \\"Frances\\", a prize boxer and basketball player. 1909 My Irish Colleen (Published anonymously in the Albany College Student, March 1909 issue) A love poem, presented as the work of an anonymous male student about an Irish girl. It was reprinted in his college yearbook in 1911, under his female name, outing his crush on Eva Cushman. 1909 To the Faculty (Published in the Albany College Student, March 1909 issue) A call for student rebellion and statement of the need of students to be taken seriously. The work discusses doves spreading their wings and flying, reflecting Hart's sense of confinement while forced to live as a sedate young woman. 1909 The American 'Martha' (Published in the Albany College Student, December 1909 issue) A critical take on the fate of women obliged to be housewives, and raising their daughters to the same destiny. The piece quoted the Bible and reflected a concern for women's rights. 1909 'Ma' on the Football Hero (Published in the Albany College Student, December 1909 issue) Hart questions \\"what would his mother would say if he were to be a rough and tough College football hero?\\" 1910 The Magic of Someday (Published in the Albany College Student, January 1910 issue) A lament on the destruction of Hart's childhood dreams of freedom when he was obliged to be female; ending with hope for a future in which he, \\"with a heart of a man,\\" might be happy. 1910 The National Triune (Published in the Albany College Student, February 1910 issue) Published as the work of \\"Lucille Hart\\", the story condemns contemporary politic scandals and the injustice of sexism, and sets out Hart's ideas about the character of a true and respectable man. 1910 The Unwritten Law of the Campus (Published in the Albany College Student, March 1910 issue) A discussion of the difference between moral laws, physical laws, and laws of convention, with reference to discourtesy of someone who tells tales on another student for contravening gender norms. 1911 An Idyll of a Country Childhood (Published in \\"The Takenah\\" (Albany College Yearbook) 1911) By now Hart's habits of male dress outside school were well-known, and this story frankly described his early life and its freedom to dress and live as a boy. =Novels= 1935 Doctor Mallory (Published W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.) An overnight best-seller, Hart's first novel drew on his experiences as a small town doctor in Gardiner, Oregon. It portrayed the medical profession as increasingly venal, and was the first expos√© of the medical world by a working doctor. 1936 The Undaunted (Published W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.) This novel showed gay physician \\"Sandy Farquhar\\" pursuing a career in radiology \\"because he thought it wouldn't matter so much in a laboratory what a man's personality was,\\" conflicts and themes which Hart himself had experienced in his early career. 1937 In the Lives of Men (Published W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.) Hart's third novel was favourably reviewed for its insights into contemporary medicine, but the reviewer at a national magazine (The Saturday Review of Literature) noted \\"as a doctor, Hart knows surprisingly little about women\\".Hart's novels received a fair amount of critical attention and were reviewed in The New York Times, The New York Herald-Tribune, Saturday Review of Literature and other leading publications of the times. Intriguingly, in reviewing In the Lives of Men, the Saturday Reviews critic wrote that, \\"...for a doctor, he seems to know surprisingly little of women. His portraits of them are little more than profile sketches. from a presentation by Brian Booth to OCHC's Discovering Oregon Originals '99 series in 2000 1942 Doctor Finlay Sees it Through (Published by Harper & Brothers) Hart's final novel, not to be confused with A. J. Cronin's Dr Finlay's Casebook, is considered to have influenced subsequent medical fiction.After the publication of Doctor Mallory, Hart wrote that one of his ambitions was \\"to be an 'unofficial observer' of the medical profession during the remainder of my life\\" and \\"to write a novel about a research institute, another about hospitals, another about a family of doctors.\\" He eventually wrote all three. Hart's other novels are In the Lives of Men (1937) and Doctor Finlay Sees it Through (1942). from a presentation by Brian Booth to OCHC's Discovering Oregon Originals '99 series in 2000 Legacy After Hart's death his wife acted on his wish to establish a fund for research into leukaemia, from which his mother had died. The interest on his estate is donated annually to the Alan L. and Edna Ruddick Hart Fund, which makes grants for research into leukaemia and its cure. Hart's will, written in 1943, stipulated that his personal letters and photographs be destroyed, and this was done on his death in 1962. Hart had acted all his life to control the interpretation of his private and emotional life, and the destruction of his personal records at his death were commensurate with this goal. Believing that the secret of his personal history was safe he made no attempt to account for his own life. His identity as the pseudonymous \\"H\\" in Gilbert's notes was discovered posthumously by Jonathan Ned Katz, and his identity described as lesbian. Katz's attempts to learn more about Hart's life by contacting Hart's widow were discouraged by Edna Ruddick Hart. The message passed on by her friend in Albany was: \\"Let that all be passed now. She is older and does not want any more heart ache now.\\" Controversy Scholarship on Hart's life has disagreed bitterly on whether he should be characterised as transgender, or lesbian, while activists and advocates for various groups have claimed Hart as a representative. Jonathan Ned Katz, who in Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A. (1976) first identified Hart as the pseudonymous \\"H\\" in Joseph Gilbert's 1920s case notes, described Hart as a lesbian and depicted his case as one where contemporary strictures against lesbianism were so strong that a 'woman' like Hart had to adopt a male identity to pursue love affairs with women. Katz contended again in his 1983 Gay/Lesbian Almanac: A New Documentary that Hart was \\"clearly a lesbian, a woman-loving woman\\", but has since said he would not make such claims today. Against Katz's claims, others like Jillian Todd Weiss have asserted that Hart experienced himself as a man from early childhood, identifying transphobia and \\"blatant disregard for transgender identities\\" in the claim that Hart was 'really' a woman. Hart's widow refused interviews to Katz, offended by his categorization of her husband (and by extension, herself) as lesbian. Some historians note that Hart never described himself as transsexual, but the term was not published until the 1920s, and not widely used until the 1960s, near Hart's death.The majority of Hart's biographers insist upon viewing the doctor as a woman in disguise, without regard for Hart's self-identification as a man, medical treatment and legal documentation. (O'Hartigan 2002)‚ÄîO'Hartigan also refers to Patrick Califia's statement that \\"Katz's book 'is unfortunately tainted with a heavy dose of transphobia.\\" She also brings up Katz's footnote in his Gay/Lesbian Almanac about an unpublished paper: \\"Transsexualism\\": Today's Quack Medicine: An Issue for Every Body, and noting his statement \\"An historical study needs to be made of the medical and autobiographical literature on 'transsexualism'; it will, I think, reveal the fundamentally sexist nature of the concept and of the associated medical treatments.\\" O'Hartigan also sets forth, disapprovingly, an explanation for referring to Hart as female by Susan Stryker: \\"As an historian favoring 'social construction' approaches to questions of identity, I have reservations about using the word transsexual to refer to people before the mid-20th century who identify in a profound, ongoing manner with a gender that they were not assigned to at birth.\\" It is also true that Hart worked hard to keep his pre- transition identity secret, and would hardly have sought to publicly claim a trans identity. Others, then, have contended that Hart was a trans pioneer, who lived after his transition exclusively as a man, just as modern transgender people do. Joy Parks describes the battle, especially within Portland, Oregon GLBT communities over Hart's identity as \\"extremely ugly\\" and one in which \\"neither side appeared particularly victorious.\\"Parks, Joy \\"Sacred Ground: News and Reviews on Lesbian Writing Additional media =Exhibitions= * In 2002 the Aubrey Watzek Library at Lewis & Clark College ran an exhibition on Hart's life and early writings, titled \\"The Lives of Men\\": A Literary Glimpse at the Life of Alberta Lucille Hart/Dr. Alan L.

The accident killed five workers and injured three. The incident is thought to be the result of shoddy work by a contractor (RPI Coating) and Xcel Energy's willingness to cut costs at the expense of safety.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeaX0IRjyd8 The plant Cabin Creek Generating Station, where the fire occurred The plant, the Cabin Creek Generating station, is a pumped storage hydroelectric generator that opened in 1967. It is located about 6 miles from Georgetown, accessed by the high mountain road of Guanella Pass. It sits at an elevation of greater than 10,000 feet above sea level. The power plant runs two generators that when running at top performance can produce a total 324 megawatts of electrical power. The plant is powered by water pressure from the water released from a storage reservoir.http://www.xcelenergy.com/Company/Operations/Cabin_Creek_Generating_Station Incident =Prior events= In 2000, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-initiated inspection of the penstock (a long, sloping tunnel and confined space running nearly 3/4 of a mile) found that the epoxy lining on the interior of the pipes was deteriorating. This was leading to damage of the pipes themselves and Xcel was mandated to repair the epoxy to limit further damage. Work did not begin in earnest until seven years later, as the company had successfully been granted extensions to the deadline for this work to be completed. Xcel energy selected RPI Coating Inc. after a competitive RFP process. This was despite RPI having had more than $100,000 of fines levied against it by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and Xcel's own rating of the company's safety profile as \\"zero.\\" A zero should have automatically disqualified RPI from the bid process. Safety concerns had been identified by Xcel's safety director and RPI arranged for a specialist to be brought to the Cabin Creek site to address specific training for operating safely during work at the plant. While 14 crew members were slated to be working on the site, only nine would attend the six-hour safety meeting. In September 2007, the tunnel was prepped for work by Xcel and RPI. This involved shutting down the plant, draining the penstock, and creating an access point for equipment and workers. A single ingress/egress point in such a tunnel would later prove to be deadly; if the route to the single point of exit were blocked, workers would become trapped. This was not the only hazard: an RPI worker dislocated a shoulder during this process, after slipping on the moss covered floor of the tunnel. Sand blasting and other prep work would last through the month of September. Internal Xcel documents show that the penstock was a permit-required confined space work area. This would have required a costly set of safety mechanisms to be put in place, including work environment monitoring, specialized rescue team on site, and rigorous control of flammable substances. Neither Xcel nor RPI actually treated the work site as permit- required confined space. In early October, re-application of the epoxy coat started with about a dozen workers inside the penstock. An epoxy sprayer was operated by a small crew, workers did prep work ahead, and others ran material from the tunnel opening to the sprayer. While the epoxy itself was not volatile at the temperatures being used, it was applied at temperatures that were below the optimum for ideal use. To cope with this, and to help with regular cleaning, a solvent was used to keep the spray equipment free from contamination. RPI workers used methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), a highly volatile chemical with a low flash point, as the solvent. It was used on the sprayer as it sat inside the tunnel, where multiple sources of ignition were present. =Explosion= On October 2 around 1:55 pm, when a safety inspector and general foreman were out to lunch, a flash fire engulfed the sprayer platform while MEK was being circulated through the equipment. A growing fire separated the work group; five workers were on the far side of the burning spray platform, unable to reach the single point of exit, more than 1400 feet away. The separated workers were able to shout over the fire and ask for fire extinguishers, but none were located inside the tunnel. Other workers would have to leave the penstock and get fire extinguishers from outside. They then had to re-enter the now smoke-filled tunnel while the fire spread to other containers of MEK and other material around the spray platform. The trapped workers retreated up a steep section of the tunnel. Due to poor visibility, thick smoke, and other fumes, workers with fire extinguishers were unable to reach the fire and it continued to burn. The workers trapped by the fire were uninjured in the explosion and maintained radio contact until 2:45 pm. =Emergency response= Clear Creek emergency communications center first received word of the incident at 2:03 pm after an RPI contractor notified Xcel about the incident and the Xcel employee called 9-1-1. First responders were immediately dispatched, but were not told that the fire was in a confined space, nor that specialized equipment by highly trained rescuers would be needed. After the enormity of the rescue was recognized, local first responders requested the help of a large, suburban Denver fire department. They also requested a mine rescue team from Climax Molybdenum Company's Henderson mine. Both agencies were over an hour away. Local responders, including a backcountry rescue team, made a single attempt to enter the tunnel, using breathing apparatus and an ATV. Conditions were still very hazardous in the tunnel, including toxic fumes and black smoke reducing visibility to zero. The rescuers were forced to turn back. Attempts to lower breathing apparatus, a radio and other equipment to the trapped workers were also made. Ultimately, the Henderson Mine Rescue Team would make entry into the tunnel and confirm both that the fire was out and that five workers were dead. Donald Dejaynes, 43, Dupree Holt, 37, James St. Peters, 52, Gary Foster, 48, and Anthony Aguirre, 18, asphyxiated. The four surviving workers were transported to a Denver hospital where they were all treated and subsequently released. In recognition of the tragic event, Colorado state governor Bill Ritter later traveled to Georgetown to meet with the families of the deceased. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board has completed an investigation into this incident.\\"Xcel Energy Company Fire\\", http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/Xcel_Energy_Report_Final.pdf Investigation and aftermath =Investigation= The case was investigated by the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and a formal report was released on August 25, 2010. The investigation was hampered by Xcel and RPI refusing to furnish testimony, evidence, and response to questions from the investigating board. Many RPI managers invoked their fifth amendment right from self-incrimination. Indeed, despite the Chemical Safety Board having a federal mandate to investigate and report about the accident, Xcel energy went to court to block the release of the report, saying it would be detrimental to their court case. Xcel Energy also leaked a confidential draft of the report to the media before the official report was released. Among the findings of the investigation: *MEK was the source of the flash fire *Both Xcel and RPI knew in advance of the need to use a flammable solvent inside the penstock *Despite the penstock having very limited egress routes, ventilation, and very dangerous working conditions, neither Xcel nor RPI treated the tunnel as a permit-required confined space as required by OSHA *Neither Xcel nor RPI's training and safety programs were adequate for the task of working in the penstock *Both Xcel and RPI had, prior to the accident, identified a single point of egress as a major safety concern, yet did nothing about it *The emergency action plan of calling 911 was inadequate, as the local emergency service providers were not equipped, nor trained, to respond to an emergency in a confined space *Xcel Energy did not follow their own guidelines when selecting RPI as a contractor for the job; RPI received a safety rating of \\"zero\\" and should have been excluded from contention, but proved to be the lowest bidder *Xcel was aware of life-threatening working conditions at the site, yet did nothing about it Allegations have been made that RPI destroyed evidence (log books, etc.) at the job site. =Criminal case against Xcel Energy and RPI Coating= On June 1, 2011, Federal prosecutors opened their charges that Xcel Energy was criminally liable for the deaths of the five RPI workers. On June 28, the jury found Xcel Energy not guilty.Ingold, John \\"Xcel Energy found not guilty in 2007 deaths of five workers in Colorado\\", 6/29/11 http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_18373502 The contractor, RPI Coating, had a long history of citations from both federal and state agencies. The company had accumulated fines totaling $135,569 from ninety incidents since 1988. Most of the fines stemmed from unsafe working conditions, such as a worker who was crushed by a work platform while working on the I-80 San Francisco Bay Bridge.Veiga Alex \\"Xcel Contractor RPI Coating Had Safety Issues\\", CBS 10/4/07, 10/15/08 These ninety incidents were accumulated while the company was operating under the name of Robison Prezioso Inc. Of the ninety fineable incidences, twenty-seven were violations considered serious by the OSHA.Frosch Dan, \\"Contractor in Fatal Fire Had Been Fined\\", The New York Times, 10/5/07, 9/12/08 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/us/05colorado.html?_r=1&oref;=slogin On December 19, 2011, RPI Coating pleaded guilty to workplace safety violations and paid $1.55 million in a cash settlement. The company took responsibility for the deaths of five workers and the injuries to three. This plea deal prevented a civil lawsuit and subjected RPI to further monitoring for workplace safety violations.

W. R. D. Bandaranaike and the leader of the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka S. J. V. Chelvanayakam on July 26, 1957. It advocated the creation of a series of regional councils in Sri Lanka as a means to giving a certain level of autonomy to the Tamil people of the country, and was intended to solve the communal disagreements that were occurring in the country at the time. The act was strongly opposed by certain sections of the Sinhalese, and was eventually torn up by Prime Minister Bandaranaike in May 1958. The abandonment of the pact led to tensions between the two communities, resulting in a series of outbreaks of ethnic violence in the country which eventually spiraled into the 26 year Sri Lankan Civil War. Prime Minister Bandaranaike's later attempts to pass legislation similar to the agreement was met by strong opposition, and led to his assassination by a Buddhist monk in 1959. Background Following the gaining of independence for Sri Lanka from Britain in 1948, English continued to be the official language of the country. However sections within the Sinhalese community, who wanted the country to distance itself from its colonial past, began a campaign to have Sinhala made the official language of Sri Lanka. At the 1956 parliamentary elections, the leader of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike campaigned on a promise to make Sinhala the sole official language of Sri Lanka. With the support of extremist Sinhalese figures, Bandaranaike won the election and was named the 4th Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. After his government was set up, he made it his priority to follow up on his promises related to the language issue, and introduced the Official Language Act (commonly known as the Sinhala Only Act) on June 5, 1956. In opposition to the act, Tamil People staged a hartal in parts of the country, and demonstrated in front of the parliament at Galle Face Green. In reaction to the legislation, the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka, the Federal Party (known as the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi in Tamil) put forward four major demands at their convention held in Trincomalee on August 20, 1956. They were, *The establishment of a new constitution for Sri Lanka based on federal principles, with the creation of one or more Tamil states enjoying wide autonomous powers *Parity status for Tamil alongside Sinhala as the official languages of the country *The repeal of citizenship laws that denied Indian Tamils Sri Lankan citizenship *The cessation of state dry land colonization schemes The Federal Party vowed that if their demands were not met by August 20, 1957, they would engage in ‚Äúdirect action by non-violent means‚Äù to achieve these objectives. They also called on their supporters to prepare for a prolonged struggle. At the same time, Prime Minister Bandaranaike faced pressure from Sinhalese extremist groups who complained about the delays in enforcing the Official Languages Act. Signing of the pact Fearing that violence would break out if an agreement between the leaders of the communities was not reached, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike reached out to the Federal Party leadership, who agreed to meet the Prime Minister in April 1957. The first meeting between a Federal Part delegation comprising its leader S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, V. A. Kandiah, N. R. Rajavarothayam, Dr E. M. V. Naganathan and V. Navaratnam, and a government delegation which included Prime Minister Bandaranaike, Minister Stanley de Zoysa and P. Navaratnarajah took place at Bandaranaike's ancestral house at Horagolla. A second meeting took place at Bandaranaike's residence in Rosemead Place, Colombo, and a final meeting was held at the Senate building on July 26, 1957. The discussions concluded successfully, with an agreement reached between the leaders. It was described by the ITAK as an ‚Äúinterim adjustment‚Äù, and would later be known as the Bandaranaike‚ÄìChelvanayakam Pact. The pact was a landmark in the history of Sri Lanka, as it marked for the first time a political agreement had been reached between the leaders of the two main ethnic groups of the country. Both sides made concessions by agreeing to the pact, with Chelvanayakam accepting less than federalism that had been demanded by the Federal Party, and Bandaranaike agreeing to give regional councils substantial powers. However the pact left out the issue of citizenship for Tamils of Indian origin. Chelvanayakam was also not entirely pleased that he had been unable to obtain a single, merged, North-Eastern province for Tamils, as he feared a divide could ensue between Tamil people in the north and the east of the country. Despite the initial doubts, the agreement was seen as a reasonable compromise by both sides, and it was believed that both Bandaranaike and Chelvanayakam had enough credibility amongst their communities to pass it through. With the agreement, the government was also able to prevent the campaign threatened by the Federal Party across the country. As an initial step towards implementing the pact, the legislators of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna agreed on a draft of the Regional Councils Bill, which would combine the 22 districts of the country into regions. The councilors of the Regional Councils were to be chosen by urban and municipal councilors. Opposition The pact was greeted by mixed reception around the country, and was immediately opposed by certain sections of both communities. The leader of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress, G. G. Ponnambalam opposed the pact, as did Member of Parliament C Suntheralingham, who in a letter to Chelvanayakam wrote that instead of the regional councils promised by the pact, he wanted ‚Äúan autonomous Tamil state which would constitute a Commonwealth of Dominion of Tamil Ilankai‚Äù. It also sparked suspicion among Sinhalese nationalist leaders, who saw it as a sell out to Tamil people. The main opposition in the Sinhalese community came from the opposition United National Party, headed by J. R. Jayawardene. Following the defeat of the UNP in the 1956 elections, Jayawardene invited former leader Dudley Senanayake to re-enter politics, and UNP used their opposition to the agreement as the basis of their return to active politics. =March to Kandy= In September 1957, Jayawardene announced a 72-mile march from Colombo to the central city of Kandy in opposition to the pact. He declared that at the end of the march, he would pray against the agreement at the sacred Buddhist shrine the Temple of the Tooth, and invoke the blessings of the gods against the agreement. The proposed march was banned by the government, which cited fears of violence, but the ban was ignored by the UNP. The march began on October 4, 1957, with Jayawardene and Dudley Senanayake and the head of the procession. At Grandpass junction in Colombo, the march was pelted with stones by supporters of the SLFP. Opposition to the march intensified further as it passed Kelaniya, and S. D. Bandaranaike, nephew of Prime Minister Bandaranaike, squatted in the middle of the road with his supporters to stop the march at Imbulgoda, in Gampaha. As a result, the UNP was forced to give up the march, and they proceeded to Kandy by vehicle, where they declared they would oppose the setting up of regional councils. =Continuing ethnic tensions= As opposition to the agreement was growing, other factors were causing increased tensions between the two communities. In 1957, the government introduced legislation to place the Sinhala character on the number plates of all vehicles in the country. This was strongly opposed by Tamil people, and the Federal Party organized an ‚Äúanti-sri‚Äù campaign. Participants in the campaign went around the north of the country applying tar on the character on vehicles they came across. This was met with anger amongst the Sinhalese community, who painted over Tamil characters in billboards around the south of the country. Abrogation Amid the growing opposition to the pact, Prime Minister Bandaranaike continued his efforts to convince the people of the country that it was the best solution to the communal problems of the country. He equated the pact to the Middle Way doctrine of Buddhism. However the demonstrations continued, and came to a head on April 9, 1958 when approximately 100 Buddhist monks and 300 other people staged a protest on the lawn of Bandaranaike's Rosemead Place residence. They demanded that the Prime Minister abrogate the agreement he signed with Chelvanayakam. After listening to the monks and consulting a few members of his cabinet, Bandaranaike publicly tore the agreement into pieces. Upon the insistence of the monks, he also gave them a written pledge that the pact would be abrogated. =Reaction= The Prime Minister's decision to abrogate the pact was greeted with dismay by moderate Tamil politicians. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman called it the ‚Äúsaddest day in the history of Ceylon‚Äôs racial relations‚Äù. V Navaratnam, a member of the Federal party who took part in the initial discussions later wrote ‚Äú(Bandaranaike's enemies) forced him to treat the B-C Pact like Adolf Hitler treated the solemn undertaking which he gave to Neville Chamberlain at Munich. To them the B-C Pact was as much a piece of paper as was the Munich paper to Hitler.\\" In response to the abrogation, the Federal Party declared they would launch a direct action campaign in the form of a non-violent Satyagraha to achieve their objectives. The decision was announced at the party's annual convention held in May 1958. However, before the protests could begin, a series of riots broke out across the country, further damaging relations between the two communities. Assassination of Bandaranaike On August 5, 1958, Prime Minister Bandaranaike introduced the Tamil Language (Special Provisions) Act No. 28 of 1958, as a compromise measure to appease the Tamil community. The bill act part of the original Official Languages Act, but had been removed at the insistence of Sinhalese extremists. The bill was passed on August 14, 1958, and it dealt with the provisions regarding education, public service entrance examinations and the administration of the north and east of the country. However it did not satisfy the Tamil politicians, and it also led Buddhists who worked for Bandaranaike to be increasingly dissatisfied with him. At the same time, the country faced unrelated anti-government strikes organized by the leftist LSSP and other communist parties in the country. In May 1959, leftist members of Bandaranaike's administration including Philip Gunawardena quit the government and joined the opposition. As Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike struggled to keep his party in power, Talduwe Somarama, a Buddhist monk called upon Bandaranaike at his residence in Rosemead Place. As Bandaranaike was paying obeisance to Somarama, the monk took out a revolver and shot Bandaranaike in his stomach at point blank range. Bandaranaike succumbed to his injuries the next day. A commission of inquiry later found that the monk was manipulated by former supporters of Bandaranaike, who helped him get elected in 1956, but now opposed his moves to appease the Tamil population. Later attempts to revive the pact At the 1960 parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka, no party was able to obtain a majority in the country's 151 member legislature. As a result, the United National Party, which obtained the most seats by a single party, formed an unstable minority government. In its quest to form a government, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), successor to the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, reached out to the Federal Party, and the two sides reached an agreement that if the Federal Party helped the SLFP form a government, the Bandaranaike‚ÄìChelvanayakam Pact would be included in the throne speech as a policy statement of the new SLFP government. As a result, the SLFP and the Federal Party, along with a number of other minority parties, voted against the speaker nominee of the UNP government, and on April 22, 1960 defeated the throne speech of the UNP government by a majority of 86 votes to 61. However instead of calling on the SLFP to form a government, the Governor General of the country called for fresh elections in July of the same year. Throughout the subsequent election campaign, the SLFP maintained contact with the Federal Party, and the agreement to include the Bandaranaike‚ÄìChelvanayakam Pact in the throne speech of a future SLFP government remained. At the July elections, the SLFP achieved a convincing victory, winning 75 seats. This permitted the party, now headed by assassinated Prime Minister S. W. R. D Bandaranaike's widow Sirimavo Bandaranaike, to form a government without the help of the Federal Party. As a result, they cast aside the agreement with the Federal Party, and later introduced legislation to make Sinhala the official language of the courts of the country. In explaining the decision, Felix Dias Bandaranaike said the government did not go through with the agreement as it would have given the UNP an opportunity to ‚Äúincite the Sinhalese extremists‚Äù as they had done in 1957.

It is the Latin American version of the original Cartoon Network television channel in the United States. It is divided into six feeds, all originating from its central headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, United States; five are in Spanish (Mexico, Argentina/Uruguay, Chile/Peru, Colombia/Venezuela/Puerto Rico), one is in Portuguese (Brazil), and another feed aimed at the Caribbean is only in English. The feeds have different schedules. It primarily airs cartoons and animated programming, marketed towards children and teens. Operated in Argentina by Turner Broadcasting System Latin America, it began broadcasting on April 30, 1993, as the first children-oriented cable channel available in the region. Argentina and Mexico had previously launched children's cable channels (The Big Channel and Cabl√≠n in Argentina and ZAZ in Mexico, all of which are now defunct), but they were only available in their respective countries. On January 1, 2017, Cartoon Network Latin America And Cartoon Network Brazil started using graphics from Cartoon Network USA's Dimensional rebrand package. History Cartoon Network began broadcasting in Latin America on April 30, 1993, becoming the first 24-hour children's animation channel in the region. Although much is not known about its first broadcast in the region, its beginnings were similar to its U.S. counterpart, whose programming focused solely on the classic cartoons of the Turner Entertainment film library, made up of studios Hanna-Barbera, MGM, Warner Bros. and Fleischer Studios. Its programming and graphics used at that time were the same as the U.S. feed, with the difference that between 1993-1995, the Latin American feed was just a Spanish-language feed from the United States, which was broadcast exclusively to the region. It was not until 1996 that this feed became completely independent of the US feed, and this began to have its own programming with its own schedules, as well as new worldwide acquisitions for the channel. In 1996, it began broadcasting its first original series, beginning with Space Ghost Coast to Coast, an original reinvention of Hanna- Barbera's superhero, which even gained the popularity of adult audiences. In addition, new original channel series were incorporated at that time, known as Cartoon Cartoons: Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, The Powerpuff Girls and Ed, Edd and Eddy, which became the channel's flagship series. In 2001, Cartoon Network made the first edition of Copa Toon, a soccer special featuring the cast of Space Ghost, whose theme was to interview several personalities from the world of sports and soccer, in addition to presenting a fictional tournament between the teams of the channel series. In that same year, it launched its new sister channel Boomerang, at that time, a new channel that would be dedicated solely to broadcast of classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons that no longer aired in the programming of the main channel due to the arrival of new series. This channel had already been launched in 2000 in the United States, and until then, it was also a block broadcast in the main channel. In January 2005, Cartoon Network introduced a new logo along with a new visual branding known as the \\"CN City\\", with a new slogan We know what you like. This change of image had already been applied first to the American feed in June 2004, and with this change of image, Cartoon Network introduced new programming confirmed by new original series such as Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, besides new acquisitions and thematic blocks. In October of the same year, the Adult Swim block was released in Latin America after 4 years of being released in the United States, focused on the adult audience of the channel with adult animations for over 18 years. The block debuted due to the popularity of the program Space Ghost Coast to Coast, one of the first programs of the channel aimed exclusively at this audience. In March 2008, Cartoon Network presented its new locally produced content, a new campaign with a new image and a complete redesign of its websites. After these changes, the Adult Swim block was removed from the channel, supposedly because of criticism from parents, considering that this segment with adult content should not be broadcast on a children's channel. However, the block continued to be broadcast by I.Sat until December 2010; years later, the block returned to the same channel in April 2015 until April 2020, when this block was moved to Warner TV. In June and July 2010, the channel began to use small idents with the logo in white, in which Toonix (similar to the Noods of the United States) appears, originally promoting the 2010 Soccer World Cup. In August 2010, the Toonix era became official, using small ads and promotional campaigns similar to those used by the Noods era of Cartoon Network, from July 2008 to May 2010. On 6 July 2011, the Toonix era began transmissions in the 16:9 aspect ratio (panoramic) with the series Total Drama although it was only experimental. On January 1, 2012, the channel launched a new logo and visual identity. In March 2012, its high-definition simulcast was launched. However, the launch of the new feed could not take place, as its distribution was still under negotiation with other cable operators in the region. The network incorporated new age rating system notices, identifying the type of content and what type of viewers could watch. In April 2013, the channel began its 20th-anniversary celebrations. Several Turner channels joined in the celebration, including Warner, TruTv, I-Sat, Boomerang, TNT, TCM and Tooncast. With this, the classic daytime programs were broadcast for that month. The celebration took place again in September, celebrating the 21st anniversary of the American signal, this time with the inclusion and the premiere of '\\"Teen Titans Go!. On January 16, 2014, the Panregional and South Atlantic feeds merged, causing the establishment of the Argentine schedule in the same feed being one of the two official times of the feed, along with the Colombian. On August 4, 2014, the channel began the \\"Check It 3.0\\" era branding (known in Latin America as \\"Cartoon Network Renewed\\") and, also, the channel finally made the transition from the aspect ratio 4:3 to 16:9. The HD feed was launched in Mexico on November 21, 2014, being Axtel the first cable operator to acquire the signal. On June 1, 2015, the South Atlantic and Panregional feeds were separated, leading to the creation of new independent feeds for the general public, including the North Atlantic feed (available for Colombia, Venezuela, Central America and the Caribbean) and the Pacific feed (available for Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia); this was done for the purpose of launching the new unified high-definition feed throughout the region. On 3 August, new bumpers were shown depicting children imitating their favourite characters; this event was named a sub-rebrand of the Check it 3.0 era listed as 3.5. For this purpose, the application CN blah! was launched. On January 4, 2016, the brand was reinforced with a new graphic identity, the \\"Check it 4.0\\" era.

Toonami aired shows that were already on the lineup, these being Gundam Wing, Pok√©mon and Dragon Ball Z, and served as the home of Inuyasha. Over the years, Toonami added shows such as Saint Seiya and Yu Yu Hakusho , as well as the revamped version of Cyborg 009 and Astro Boy . However, the block had to move to the late-night slots on CN Latin America, due to protests of violent scenes on the block. CN moved the block in November 2004. In 2005, Toonami had short-lived weekend schedules, which were later replaced by the premiere of Adult Swim in Latin America (7 October 2005).

In June 2006, Toonami premiered anime movies in two monthly variations: Dragon Ball Theatricals (which had 17 different Dragon Ball movies), and Toonami Movies (general animated action movies). In 2007, Cartoon Network cut Toonami completely. The movies were no longer aired (with the exception of the Dragon Ball movies). After its cancellation in Latin America on 26 March 2007, the block's programming gradually vanished. In January 2010, the block Animaction was created, showing on Wednesday evenings. This block broadcast both action programming and anime programming before it was removed in April 2011.

In humans, inhibition of xanthine oxidase reduces the production of uric acid, and several medications that inhibit xanthine oxidase are indicated for treatment of hyperuricemia and related medical conditions including gout. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are being investigated for management of reperfusion injury. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are of two kinds: purine analogues and others. Purine analogues include allopurinol, oxypurinol, and tisopurine. Others include febuxostat, topiroxostat, and inositols (phytic acid and myo- inositol). In experiments, numerous natural products have been found to inhibit xanthine oxidase in vitro or in model animals (mice, rats). These include three flavonoids that occur in many different fruits and vegetables: kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin. More generally, planar flavones and flavonols with a 7-hydroxyl group inhibit xanthine oxidase. An essential oil extracted from Cinnamomum osmophloeum inhibits xanthine oxidase in mice. The natural product propolis from selected sources inhibits xanthine oxidase in rats; the specific substance responsible for this inhibition has not been identified, and the generality of these findings is unknown. An extract of leaves of Pistacia integerrima also inhibits xanthine oxidase at a level that appears to merit further research. In folk medicine the tree fern Cyathea spinulosa (formerly Alsophila spinulosa) has been used for gout, but its most active component, caffeic acid, is only a weak inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.

Family life He was born in October 1820, the third son of a solicitor, Benjamin Currey of Old Palace Yard, Westminster. He married Emily Harriet Rugge-Price in Spring Grove, London on 2 April 1845. Emily, born in 1818 and two years Henry's senior, was the daughter of Sir Charles Rugge-Price. There were four children from the marriage: Annette, Charles, Henrietta and Percival, who also became an architect. Education and work Educated at Dr Pinckney's School at East Sheen and at Eton College, where he rowed in the school eight against Westminster, Currey was articled to the architect Decimus Burton for five years. He then worked for five years at the office of William Cubitt (1791‚Äì1863) and Company of Gray's Inn Road, London. His first medical works were for the Surrey Lunatic Asylum, and soon after, in 1847, he was appointed as the architect and surveyor to the governors of St Thomas' Hospital, a post he held until his death.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-204399-block-9-of-st-thomas- s-hospital-medical- In this post, he designed the new hospital, built in the 'pavilion style', which opened on the Albert Embankment by Westminster Bridge in 1871, including a teaching hospital and a nursing school to a design approved by Florence Nightingale. He was also the architect and surveyor to Coram's Foundling Hospital and to the Magdalen Hospital in London. Other notable works include the hotel at London Bridge Station, 1861‚Äì62, a grand 250-room terminus hotel built at a cost of ¬£111,000, later turned into offices for the LBSCR in 1892 and demolished after bomb damage in 1941 He was a Fellow of the RIBA from 1856 and served as its vice-president in 1874‚Äì77 and 1889‚Äì93. He was also a fellow of the Surveyors' Institute (now the RICS) and an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1859, he was appointed by the 7th Duke of Devonshire to replace his former architect, James Berry. Currey held the position for 40 years. Work at Buxton Henry Currey's Grade II listed Buxton Thermal Baths As architect for the extensive Devonshire Estate in Buxton, Currey was highly influential in the town's development as a Victorian spa resort, much in his preferred Italianate design. Between 1852 and 1853 the Thermal Baths and Natural Baths (on either side of The Crescent) were completely rebuilt to his designs. He also designed Buxton's St Ann's Well of 1852. He was the architect of Corbar Hall and Devonshire Villas in the same year. Currey's Market Hall was built in 1857 but it was destroyed by fire in 1885 (the present Buxton Town Hall was built on the site in 1889). In 1859 he remodelled half of John Carr's Great Stables as the Devonshire Hospital (to which Robert RIppon Duke later added the dome), now known as the Devonshire Dome. In 1863 he designed the grand Palace Hotel in the style of a French ch√¢teau. The dining room extension to the Old Hall Hotel was designed by Currey. During the 1860s he designed various villas on Cavendish Terrace (now the Broad Walk). He was also the architect of several churches: Holy Trinity Church (built in 1873), Christ Church at Burbage (built in 1861), Congregational Church (built in 1863, demolished in 1983), Devonshire Park Chapel (built in 1873, demolished c.1970) and the vicarage for St John's Church. In 1894 he designed Buxton's new Pump Room (at the foot of The Slopes), which was opened by the 8th Duke of Devonshire in front of a vast crowd. Work at Eastbourne Henry Currey‚Äôs Grade II listed Devonshire Park Theatre in EastbourneThe Duke of Devonshire owned many buildings and much land in Eastbourne. In 1870, he designed the original College House for Eastbourne College, a project which was followed three years later by drawings for the chapel, and in 1879, Currey was to design the school's Cavendish Library. The gables and dormer windows of many of the large houses in the same part of Eastbourne (now known locally as 'Lower Meads') also bear witness to his style of architecture. Between 1874 and 1875, he designed the Winter Garden and Pavilion in Devonshire Park, both of which are now Grade II listed buildings. Nearby is the Devonshire Park Theatre, in Italianate style, a building which was influenced by his travels to Italy in the early 1860s. The Queen's Hotel on Marine Parade was his largest single project in the town. The building took a mere 11 months to erect and opened for guests in June 1880. The hotel stands in a prominent position opposite the pier and enjoys easterly views to Hastings and to Beachy Head in the west. Between 1881 and 1883, he designed the Bedfordwell Pumping Station for the Eastbourne Waterworks Company; the yellow- and red-brick Classical-style building was listed at Grade II in March 2014. His Kentish ragstone and Bath Stone St Peter's Church, again in the 'Lower Meads' area of the town, was completed in 1895 in Early English Gothic Revival style and could accommodate 800 worshippers. It was, however, made redundant and demolished in 1971. Death and interment He died at his home, The Chestnuts, Lawrie Park, Sydenham, on 23 November 1900 and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery.

A lecturer at the University of Canterbury for many years up until his retirement in 2002, he wrote several biographies of senior Royal Air Force officers, including Hugh Dowding and Keith Park. He was also involved in academic controversy through his supervision of a student that produced a master's thesis denying some aspects of the Holocaust. Biography George Vincent Orange was born on 24 September 1935 in Shildon in County Durham, England. He was educated at St. Mary‚Äôs Grammar School in nearby Darlington. He then served in the Royal Air Force from 1953 to 1956, after which he went to the University of Hull. Graduating with a Doctor of Philosophy, he emigrated to New Zealand in 1962, where he took up a position lecturing in history at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. His academic interests was the medieval period and the First and Second World Wars. He was considered to be a popular lecturer, teaching in an engaging style. Orange authored numerous articles and conference papers in addition to several books, primarily biographies of senior officers of the Royal Air Force. His subjects included Hugh Dowding and Keith Park, both of whom played prominent roles in the Battle of Britain as well as Johnny Checketts, a New Zealand flying ace. He also contributed several biographical essays to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. In 2000, Orange's supervision of a masters student, Joel Hayward, was the subject of academic and media attention. The resulting thesis, written by Hayward in 1993 but embargoed until 1999 and for which he received an A+ grade, was determined to deny some aspects of the Holocaust. The New Zealand Jewish Council had sought revocation of Hayward's Master's degree but after an investigation, the University of Canterbury found it had no powers to do so. The investigation found that while the thesis should have not been awarded such a high mark, a degree could only be revoked upon evidence of dishonesty. It could find no such evidence. The University issued an apology for accepting the thesis. Orange, who had defended his supervision of Hayward during the investigation, later commented on the lack of expertise on Holocaust revisionism among the members of the inquiry. After 40 years of teaching at the University of Canterbury, Orange retired in 2002, by which time he was a reader. He later lectured at the New Zealand Defence Force's Command and Staff College. He died on 26 November 2012 and was survived by his wife and two step-children. His last book, exploring the relationship between Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the senior command of the Royal Air Force, was released posthumously by the publishing company Grub Street. It received praise for \\"offering a readable and at times insightful account of Britain‚Äôs leading airmen\\" but noted that its discussion of Bomber Command's air offensive \\"seems inadequate\\".

The current Stone Gods drummer, Robin Goodridge, does not play on this single, as it was recorded before Ed Graham's departure. The lyrics detail a man's holiday in Spain, not caring and relieving stress, with the title of the song referring to the warning phrase \\"Don't drink the water\\", used to deter foreign visitors from drinking water of which their metabolism may be unused to, causing illness. Music video The music video is performed entirely in a small, dark room, in which there are a few bright lights, which occasionally pulse with the music. The band is dressed in dark colours, with frontman Richie wearing a leather jacket and a pair of trademark opaque Aviator sunglasses. The camera shots are all close, swaying around and brief, resting on an individual band member for only a few seconds, and many close-ups of guitars. The video is six seconds longer than the studio track, due to the silence at the beginning of the video.

The 21.66 mile railroad line was purchased from the Illinois Central Railroad by the Mississippi Department of Transportation and leased to the Kosciusko & Southwestern Railway. The company once specialized in transporting wood products from local woodyards, but after 2005 existed entirely by storing surplus freight cars for large leasing companies. The railroad interchanged with Canadian National, and later with Grenada Railway at Aberdeen Junction. On July 28, 2011, Grenada Railway filed an embargo, due to a bridge problem, which took a portion their line out of service. This embargo, which included the part of their line which connected to KSRY, meant that no traffic would be accepted to or from points within that section. On September 20, 2011, Grenada Railway filed a formal petition to abandon that segment which included the KSRY interchange. That petition was later withdrawn, but the embargo remains in effect as of early 2013. With no rail service available to move cars in or out, KSRY was essentially a railroad to nowhere. Although KSRY was actively working with three prospective shippers in Kosciusko at the time of the embargo, any such efforts were rendered useless as long as the connecting line was not in service. Planned repairs to two KSRY bridges were put on hold. Maintenance efforts were reduced to vegetation control in specific areas. The remaining freight cars stored on the line were sold by the owner, removed from the railroad by a contractor in early 2014, and scrapped. With no revenue, and no foreseeable prospect for resumption of service on the Grenada Railway line which connected KSRY to the rest of the nation‚Äôs rail system, the contract with the state was terminated and the company filed for dissolution. As of late 2014, the portion of Grenada Railway which connects to the former KSRY remains out of service. The state still owns the former KSRY line. There has been a suggestion that the rails be removed and a hiking trail be created along the right of way. It is also possible that a new operator could resume service at some point in the future. Motive Power The KSRY had three small locomotives: *1 GE 25-ton switcher (no number) *1 GE 45-ton switcher (KSRY 503) Both were sold to North Mississippi Rail Services and trucked from the property. A third locomotive, *1 Plymouth Locomotive Works 12-ton switcher (KSRY 202) was privately owned and is also no longer on the property.

It contains the graves of 284 German and 229 Commonwealth soldiers, principally those killed during the Battle of Mons. The cemetery was established by the German Army on land donated by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie. It was initially designed as a woodland cemetery before being redesigned by William Harrison Cowlishaw after the Imperial War Graves Commission took over maintenance of the cemetery after the war. Notable Commonwealth burials in the cemetery include John Parr and George Lawrence Price, traditionally believed to be the first and last Commonwealth soldiers killed in action during the First World War, and Maurice Dease, the first posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross of World War I. Notable German burials include Oskar Niemeyer, the first Iron Cross recipient of World War I. History =Battle of Mons= The Battle of Mons took place as part of the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the advancing German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco- German borders. The British position on the French flank meant that it stood in the path of the German 1st Army. The British reached Mons on 22 August 1914 and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located on the right of the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed to hold the line of the Cond√©‚ÄìMons‚ÄìCharleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the advancing German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal. At dawn on 23 August a German artillery bombardment began on the British lines; throughout the day the Germans concentrated on the British at the salient formed by the loop in the canal. At the first German infantry assault began, with the Germans attempting to force their way across four bridges that crossed the canal at the salient. The initial German attack was repulsed with heavy losses but after the Germans switched to an open formation their advance progress more quickly as the looser formation made it more difficult for the British to inflict casualties rapidly. By the afternoon the British position in the salient had become untenable and by the British began retreating to a new defensive line. =Establishment= Most of the British and German dead from the Battle of Mons were initially buried in church and local cemeteries in Mons and surrounding villages rather than a purpose built military cemetery. Subsequently, the German Army decided to exhume and re- inter the dead in a single location, as they determined the care and maintenance of isolated graves was unsustainable over the long term. In spring 1916, a German officer by the name of Captain Roemer was searching for an appropriate piece of cemetery land south-east of Mons. During this search he approached renowned biologist and local landowner Jean Houzeau de Lehaie, who offered some former quarry land on his family estate lands between the districts of St. Symphorien and Spienne, possibly to ensure that land associated with Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes was not employed instead. Roemer initially proposed that the land be requisitioned, with compensation being provided by the local authorities. Houzeau de Lehaie refused to accept payment for the land and agreed to part with it only under the condition that it be donated instead of requisitioned, and that in the cemetery the dead of both sides be treated with equal respect. During 1916 and 1917 Landsturm Infantry Battalions exhumed burials from isolated and less maintainable sites and re-interred them in the new cemetery. Most of the bodies that were exhumed were from the north and north east of the Mons battlefield especially near Nimy and Obourg where the British stopped Imperial German units from crossing the Mons-Conde canal. The German and British dead were reburied in graves with markers containing the message Enemies in Life but United in Death (), a common German practice during the First World War. The cemetery was inaugurated on 6 September 1917 with a ceremony attended by prominent German figures, including Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, Albrecht, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, and Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The cemetery contained 245 German and 188 British graves at the end of the war. This number increased in the post-war period, as both British and German remains from numerous isolated burial locations were concentrated to St. Symphorien until the cemetery reached its current number of 284 German soldiers and 229 Commonwealth soldiers. Most of the identified German dead in the cemetery died in 1914 and were from units of IX Corps, which originated from the north of Germany from towns like Kiel, Hamburg and Bremen, and in Schleswig-Holstein. =Post-war= alt=a map showing the areas of raised land as well as the location of each plot and memorial At the end of the war in November 1918, the maintenance of Commonwealth graves passed to Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). From June 1921, the Belgian War Graves Commission appointed a supervisor to maintain the German graves as the Germans could not do so themselves on account of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1926, Belgium and Germany reached an agreement for the gradual transfer of maintenance responsibility to the Official German Burial Service in Belgium () representative at the embassy to Germany in Brussels. The Germans officially referred to the cemetery as Ehrenfriedhof Saint-Symphorien-Spiennes. Number 191. The name recognized that the cemetery was both located in close proximity to the town of Saint- Symphorien and technically located in the administrative areas of Spiennes while concurrently incorporating the number assigned to the cemetery in a Belgian ordered list of German cemeteries. On 13 October 1930, representatives of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, the Belgian War Graves Commission and the Imperial War Graves Commission met in Brussels to discuss the status of mixed British-German cemeteries in Belgium. In particular, they met to discuss the status of cemeteries established by Germans during the war where the majority of those buried in the cemetery were German. This meeting was brought about because the Imperial War Graves Commission had begun altering the layout of cemeteries containing a high percentage concentration of German dead and began replacing the existing headstones on the Commonwealth graves with the standardized Imperial War Graves Commission headstones, all without first consulting with the German Burial Service in Belgium. The German delegation hoped to retain the established design character of the cemeteries but were ultimately unsuccessful. Control for the cemetery was immediately passed to the Imperial War Graves Commission and further German contribution was limited to providing headstones for a number of graves that were lacking markers. Now that the Imperial War Graves Commission was in full control of the cemetery they immediately set about redesigning it, assigning the task to Assistant Architect William Harrison Cowlishaw. In 1933 Fritz Schult, Chief of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin to request that the Imperial War Graves Commission be approached to take control over other split British-German cemeteries such as those at Marcinelle New Communal Cemetery and Hautrage Military Cemetery. The Imperial War Graves Commission was maintaining the German graves at St. Symphorien at no cost to Germany and Schult believed it favorable to transfer management of other cemeteries if the Imperial War Graves Commission would assume all maintenance costs for those cemeteries as well. =Modern= On 4 August 2014, a ceremony was held at the cemetery to mark the 100th anniversary of the British and Belgian declaration of war following the German invasion of Belgium. It was attended by many important dignitaries including: King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of The Belgians, Prince William, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry as representatives of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Head of the Commonwealth, Joachim Gauck President of Germany, Michael D. Higgins President of the Republic of Ireland, Prime Minister of Belgium Elio Di Rupo and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron. Design =Original design= Captain B√§umer designed the cemetery, assisted by militia-private Pieper. They developed a site plan based on the concept of Cemetery Reform (), which was popular in Germany at the time. In the cemetery design, particular attention was paid to ensuring simplicity with uniformity in each plot, all within a calming, arboreal environment consistent with a woodland cemetery () style. Thirteen plots were marked off and young trees ‚Äì and later extra conifers ‚Äì were planted between the plots to ensure their visual and physical separation. The cemetery land itself had many artificial created differences in elevation due to the site being used as a dumping location for surplus soil associated with phosphate mining in the area. The cemetery plants were donated by the city of Bielefeld. alt=In the foreground, a collection of differently designed headstones in a green, mostly open, field surrounded by trees. In the background the German designed obelisk and British designed Cross of Sacrifice, each on raised hills, can be seen. The German graves were grouped according to military unit. Every grave in each grouping receiving a similar headstone, but not necessarily the same as that in other groupings. There were a number of organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass-produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones. The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone, principally bluestone and Belgian Petit Granit. German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based. The Germans treated the British dead in a similar manner to their own. All of the British were buried in individual plots and, like the Germans, grouped by unit as far as possible. The deceased British officers were buried in a plot separate from their troops and it is not known how these graves were marked before they were provided with the standardized Imperial War Grave Commission headstone. The Germans also erected simple regimental memorials that identified the unit or regiment within a number of the British groupings. This included one to the Middlesex Regiment which was mistakenly referred to as the \\"Royal Middlesex Regiment\\" although that was not its name at the time. A classical high obelisk memorial made of bluestone was placed near the entrance at the highest point in the cemetery. The monumental inscription on the obelisk is written in German and is dedicated to the German and British soldiers that died during the Battle of Mons: \\"In memory of the German and English soldiers who fell in the actions near Mons on the 23rd and 24th August 1914.\\" (). Near the cemetery entrance, a tablet in Latin was set out to explain the land was gifted for the purpose of a cemetery by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie. =Cowlishaw redesign= Full control of the St Symphorien cemetery was transferred to the Imperial War Graves Commission in 1930 after which William Harrison Cowlishaw set about redesigning the cemetery. The main change was the conversion from a woodland cemetery to the more open English garden style cemetery present at most Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries. Many of the trees were chopped down, particularity those in the predominantly British south-eastern side, and grass sown in this area. The cemetery was made to feel more open but no changes were made to the location of the graves, effectively leaving each plot layout in situ choosing instead to remove vegetation that provided the visual compartmentalization to each plot. The predominantly German north-eastern half was left more characteristically in a woodland cemetery style, although many trees were pruned to ensure that an open view was created between the various plots. The original German headstones were retained and several German headstones added due to transferred graves from other sites. The other principal change was earthwork to create a raised hill where the Cross of Sacrifice would be erected. The German general monument was in no way modified but Cowlishaw likely created the hill to ensure the Cross of Sacrifice was not dwarfed by the German monument. Special memorials were erected to five soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment believed to be buried in unnamed graves. Other special memorials record the names of four British soldiers, buried by the Germans in Obourg Churchyard, whose graves could not be found. Approximately 100 Commonwealth soldiers buried at St Symphorien were unidentified. They are interned under a headstone with a quote by Rudyard Kipling: \\"A Soldier of the Great War, Known Unto God.\\" Notable graves Notable German burials include Musketier Oskar Niemeyer from the 84th Infantry Regiment was the first recipient of the Iron Cross during the war. Having come to a crossing of the Mons‚ÄìCond√© canal with a closed swing bridge he swam across the canal, returned across the canal with a requisitioned small boat, paddled back across the canal with a team and then opened the bridge allowing the Germans troops to cross in greater numbers. He was killed shortly after opening the bridge. Notable Commonwealth burials in the cemetery include Private John Parr, of the 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment and George Lawrence Price of the Canadian 28th (Northwest) Battalion each believed to be the respective first and last Commonwealth soldiers killed in action during the First World War, as is George Ellison. Also buried in the cemetery is Maurice Dease who was the first posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross in the war. Dease was awarded the Victoria Cross for defending Nimy Bridge and maintained firing of a machine gun until he was hit for a fifth and final time.

In the 1950s and the 1960s, he was one of the busiest German theatre and film actors.  Family life and upbringing  Born at Freiburg in 1914, Regnier owed his name to his grandfather, a native Frenchman. Regnier was the first child of Anton Karl Regnier and Emile (Milly) Maria Friederike Harrer, born in Freiburg im Breisgau. His father was a general practitioner and Charles initially wanted to become a doctor. Charles Regnier grew up in Strasbourg and Badenweiler where his maternal grandparents owned the Schloss Hausbaden hotel. After his father's suicide in 1924, his mother first moved with her four sons to Heidelberg, and then to Montreux on Lake Geneva. When his mother contracted tuberculosis in 1929, the family decided to move to the sanatorium at Davos. Here, Charles met a number of celebrities, including the writer Klabund, who awakened Regnier's interest in literature and the theatre. Together with his brothers, Charles produced Klabund's comedy XYZ: For three actors in three actsKlabund: 1928: X Y Z. Spiel zu Dreien in drei Aufz√ºgen. With a foreword by Otto Stoessl. Reclam, Leipzig. for a performance in Klabund's private living room. His first acting performance was starring as the Countess Y in this piece. \\"As an actor I never again had the opportunity to play a lady, but often showed how one plays a lady,\\" Regnier wrote in his personal memoirs.  Career  Regnier's first engagement was in 1938 at the theatre at Greifswald, where he met actress and singer Pamela Wedekind, a daughter of the playwright Frank Wedekind. They married on 21 June 1941 in Berlin. In 1941, Regnier was invited by Otto Falckenberg to join the ensemble of the Munich Kammerspiele, where he remained until 1958. From 1946, Regnier worked as a drama teacher at the newly founded Otto-Falckenberg-Schule. From 1961 to 1962, he was an ensemble member of the Wiener Burgtheater. Regnier preferred not to make a distinction between high art performances and entertainment, saying, \\"The public should find my work effective, entertaining, in short: agreeable.\\"M√ºnchner Merkur, 15/16 September 2001 Regnier lived in Germany, Italy and Switzerland. He died on 13 September 2001 after suffering a stroke in Bad Wiessee. He was buried in the Badenweiler-Lipburg cemetery, close to his childhood home. His literary estate can be found in the archives of the Academy of the Arts in Berlin.

Besides vocals, it was recorded in the late 1990s. Guitar and drums were recorded at Stage Door Rehearsal Studio, in Alexandria, while bass guitar was recorded by drummer Lucius Borich, at his home on a TASCAM 8-track portastudio, before Luke Gower joined the band on bass guitar. These tracks served as demonstration recordings that had them booked for performance, and eventually signed to booking agent TPA, through Owen Orford. Frustrated at the lack of label interest, Orford, despite his lack of experience with record labels started his own to release the Just Visiting EPs, on Little Samurai Records. Just Visiting Part 1 was issued on 21 January 2002 on the MGM Distribution label, which peaked at No. 14 on the ARIA Heavy Rock & Metal Singles Chart. While Just Visiting Part 2 appeared on 1 October in that year and reached No. 4 on the same component chart.

Character biography Bernard Jeffrey McCullough was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised by his mother, \\"Big Mama\\". He barely knew his father and he had two sisters, Bernita (Niecy Nash) and Stacy, and an older brother, Carl (Glynn Turman), and a younger brother, Darryl. In the episode \\"Sweet Home Chicago, Part Two\\", Bernie discovers that his father was really his \\"Uncle\\" Ellister (In that same episode, he mentions to his niece that his father showed up at his birthday party asking for money. Since his \\"Uncle Ellister\\" was his actual father this would make the man he was talking about his stepfather). He decided he wanted to be a comedian. While delivering a package to a friendly customer (who was actually his future father in law, Lloyd), he met his future wife, Wanda (Kellita Smith). He had a rough start but he eventually won her heart and they later married in 1996. When Bernie's career took off they moved to Los Angeles. During that time, Bernie lived a happy life with his beautiful wife throughout a five-year period. In the pilot, he has to take in his sisters three children: Jordan (Jeremy Suarez), Bryana (Dee Dee Davis) and Vanessa (Camille Winbush). At first his patience is put to the test on a daily basis from Vanessa's attitude and Jordan's insecurities, but as the show progressed, he began to love and support the children as if they were his own. He frequently threatens to beat his children, saying things like, \\"Bust yo head 'til the white meat shows!\\" and \\"Excuse me, America...I gotta go stunt one of them kids growth\\". Mac would always speak to the audience and address them as \\"America\\". The show is somewhat of a spoof of a reality series. In the series finale, he gets an electrical shock and when he recovers he worries what will happen to his \\"Angels\\" if something happened to him. He decides to teach Jordan how to be more masculine (including teaching him how to make a \\"Mac Sandwich\\") and Bryana how to be more careful of the things she uses (which was the cause of his shock, because she put a Baked potato wrapped in aluminum foil in the microwave and when he foolishly tried to cut it off, he was electrocuted). Vanessa finally finds a college but does not want him to be involved. With Wanda's advice, Vanessa changes her feelings towards her uncle and they reconcile. Bernie discovers that Jordan has been taking advantage of his kindness and in the final scene of the series, Bernie takes back the iPod he bought him. Unlike the real Bernie Mac, Bernie McCullough (the TV character) was married with no children; however, in real life, Bernie Mac was married with one daughter. Bernie Mac did not look after his sister's three children after his daughter left home. \\"In reality, the story is a blend of two real incidents: Mac briefly took in his gang-banging niece Toya and her daughter Monique; while a friend of his had to raise her junkie sister's children long- term.\\"https://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/2008/08/bernie_mac_in_his_own_words.html Mac discussed a fictional custody arrangement with his sister's children in a stand-up routine which was eventually featured in The Original Kings of Comedy stand up show and the accompanying Spike Lee movie.The Original Kings of Comedy, beginning around the 95-minute mark. This routine contained the germinating idea for Bernie McCullough's custody of his nieces and nephew in The Bernie Mac show. From 2005 until 2009, The character Bernie was one of the official U'z Guys on Chicago's television station The U. The U'z Guys is a lineup of all the male main characters from the station's television programs. Bernie was removed from the lineup when The Bernie Mac Show was removed from the station's schedule. Relationship with family Bernie uses tough-love parenting tactics and he can be both strict and comical. He narrates the series, and between scenes he talks to the audience by addressing them as \\"America.\\" Although he loves all three kids, his favorite is Bryana (whom he affectionately calls \\"Baby Girl\\" because she is the youngest), and always finds himself going head to head with teenage Vanessa, the eldest sibling, whose poor attitude always gives him a hard time; though it is revealed in the episode Jac and Jacequline that the only reason he's so hard on her is because she reminds him of her mother and he's determined to keep her from suffering a similar fate to her mother. Reception =Critical response= The character and Bernie Mac's performance have received widespread critical acclaim throughout the series' run. Many viewers have called the character an exceptionally liked lead and critics have associated most of the show's success to Mac. Bernie McCullough was ranked #47 in TV Guide's list of the \\"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\\". =Awards and nominations= Bernie Mac received various individual awards and nominations for his performance as Bernie McCullough. Mac was nominated for 2 consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2002 and 2003 but lost to Ray Romano as Ray Barone in Everybody Loves Raymond and Tony Shaloub as Adrian Monk in Monk, respectively.

Walsh and Michael Elkins wrote the screenplay, which was based on the Book of Esther of the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament. It recounts the origin of the Jewish celebration of Purim. An international co-production released by 20th Century Fox, Esther and the King was filmed in Italy in the CinemaScope format and the DeLuxe color process. Mario Bava, the film's cinematographer, was credited as a co-director on Italian prints of the film.Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark by Tim Lucas, Published by Video Watchdog Plot The film is set in Persia in the 5th century BC. After the King‚Äôs wife is murdered, Esther (a Jewish woman) comes to the attention of the recently widowed King Ahasuerus. The king has been trying to stifle and defeat the campaign of hatred against the Jews by his evil minister Haman (Sergio Fantoni). Before the King can pair off with Esther and defeat the villainous Haman, there are several intervening adventures and an additional, attractive woman who competes for attention.Plot Synopsis by Eleanor Mannikka from allmovie.com website Cast The film's on- screen credits list the cast in the following order and sections: ;Starring *Joan Collins as Esther *Richard Egan as Ahasuerus, King of Persia ;With *Denis O'Dea as Mordecai *Sergio Fantoni as Haman *Rick Battaglia as Simon *Renato Baldini as Klydrathes *Gabriele Tinti as Samuel *Rosalba Neri as Zeresh *Robert Buchanan as Hegai ;Also starring * Daniela Rocca as Vashti *Folco Lulli as Tobiah Production In December 1950, 20th Century Fox studio executive Darryl F. Zanuck announced he intended to produce The Story of Esther as a follow-up to David and Bathsheba, which he was producing at the time. He entrusted Frank and Doris Hursley with the task of writing the screenplay. George Jessel expressed interest in producing the film. In February 1951, Henry King was assigned to direct the film. In October, producers Joseph Bernhard and Anson Bond purchased the script from the Hursleys and were planning the film as a 20th Century Fox release. In February 1952, Hedy Lamarr bought the Hursley script for $25,000; Arthur B. Krim of United Artists negotiated the deal for her. Lamarr wanted to portray Esther and produce the story as an independent feature and United Artists release, with the possibility of filming it in Italy. She eventually decided to produce it in Rome as the first episode of a British television series titled The Great Love Stories, but the project changed and the story was not filmed. The 1960 Writers Guild of America strike, which began in January, forced 20th Century Fox to cease production temporarily. Fox president Spyros Skouras and producer Buddy Adler asked director Raoul Walsh if he could \\"make a film very quickly for them, because they had nothing at all, the studios were practically shut. That's why we made Esther in Italy.\\" Release Esther and the King premiered in New York City at the RKO Palace Theatre on November 18, 1960. The film grossed 126% and was considered a hit film of the 1960-61 season. Critical response James D. Ivers, writing for Motion Picture Daily, was enthusiastically positive: \\"All the trappings of a Biblical spectacle, exotic sets and costumes, a moving and dramatic story, and the skilled and experienced hand of Raoul Walsh make this a worthy and potentially successful entry in the present cycle of historical epics.\\" Ivers also commended the performances of the leading actors: \\"Joan Collins plays Esther with beauty and some depth, Richard Egan is properly virile as a soldierly but unstatesmanlike King Ahasuerus, and Denis O' Dea is dignified and devout as Mordecai\\". The supporting actors who earned notice were a \\"satisfactory\\" Rik Battaglia, a \\"sufficiently menacing\\" Sergio Fantoni, and a \\"somewhat overly voluptuous\\" Daniela Rocca. Ivers also admired the technical aspects of the film: \\"Color by DeLuxe and excellent camera work by Mario Bava give an eye- filling background to the straightforward story.\\" Some critics did not like the film. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave the film a blatantly negative review, writing that the \\"beautiful Bible story of Esther\\" had \\"been thumped into a crude costume charade\\". Harrison's Reports thought the film \\"has a hackneyed script and two incompetent lead players [Collins and Egan],\\" but praised O'Dea's portrayal of Mordecai. In recent years, Rosalba Neri's performance has been evaluated as \\"memorable\\". Home media In 2014, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released Esther and the King on DVD as part of the manufactured-on-demand Cinema Archives line.

Life =Origin and family= Maria was a member of the Petraliphas family, of Italian origin. Her brother John Petraliphas was a ranking noble in the court of the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos (), and was appointed as governor of Thessaly and Macedonia. In 1195, however, he played a leading role in Isaac's ouster and his replacement with Alexios III Angelos (). John's daughter Theodora Petraliphaina married Michael II Komnenos Doukas, the illegitimate son of the founder of the Epirote state, Michael I Komnenos Doukas. =Marriage= She married Theodore Komnenos Doukas sometime during Theodore's stay at the court of the Theodore I Laskaris. Theodore was a son of the sebastokrator John Doukas and of Zoe Doukaina. After the Fourth Crusade captured Constantinople in 1204, he followed Laskaris to Asia Minor, where Laskaris founded the Empire of Nicaea.

It is the fourth title in the Tak series following Tak: The Great Juju Challenge. Plot In the beginning, Tak complains about Jibolba making him clean the Spoiled Shrine. Jeera offers to take the J-Runner, but Tak wants to take a shortcut through the jungle. Despite Keeko's warning, Tak goes anyway. After going through a long trail full of Woodie Tribesmen, Tak finally makes it to the shrine. After fighting his way up, Tak gets to the top of the shrine. Tak decides to lift up a giant gem, and stuff everything below it. However, he cannot support the gem with his Magic, and it falls and breaks. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and these long trails of magic fly out. Suddenly, four gigantic Big Gs appear, and start wreaking havoc on the world. When Tak goes back to the village, Jibolba tells Tak that whoever did this must see the four Jujus known as the Guardians of Gross. First Tak sees Debris Juju, and after winning a mini-game, Tak gets Lumpy Magic. He then sets out for the first G, Trashthulu. After a long trail, he uses a catapult to launch onto Trashthulu. When he lands, he must use Lumpy Magic to make it to the head of the beast. Once inside, he grabs the essence gem of the beast, and he must jab his staff into the eyes to defeat him. When both eyes are handled, Tak jumps out, and the beast turns to stone and collapses. After, Tak goes to Icky Juju, and he gets Slime Magic. Tak surfs through a river of slime onto Slopviathan. Now, Tak must get through the slop, and make it to the head of the beast. Once here, he pumps the eyes of Slopviathan with Slime and they explode. He then grabs the essence, and jumps off as Slopviathan turns to stone. Next, he goes to Melty Juju, who gives Tak Cheesy Magic. He then waits, but is eaten by Gorgonzilla. He now goes through his body until he is in the lower jaw of the G. He then hits the hurt teeth of the beast, which makes his top jaw fly open while he cries. Tak then starts beating the uvula of the beast. This makes the essence fly off his forehead, and the beast turns to stone and crumbles. Finally, Tak heads to Stinky Juju where he gets Stinky Magic. Now, he heads to Stinkolossus by going through another jungle path. Here he makes it to the beast, and he must fight to the top, while fighting three smaller stink beasts. When he makes it to the top, he is floating on platforms, swirling around the G. He then beats the three smaller beasts again, and then he must shoot the monster's Stink Bombs back at him. This makes him spit out his essence, and Tak escapes. Now, with all essences, Tak restores the gem. When he is about to put the essences back, Stinky Juju returns to see. Tak trips, and the beasts are free again. When Tak thinks all is lost, Stinly Juju tells Tak there is another way. If he can collect slime from all the Gs, and burp, it will defeat the Gs once and for all. And, after a race in the J-Runner, Tak does just this. Tak celebrates, and the game is over. Gameplay The game is a linear platformer with a focus on using a series of parkour moves in order to jump over obstacles and run through walls. A good number of levels are structured around Tak having to find his way across the bodies of each of the Big Gs in a vertical fashion in order to reach their heads and engage in a boss battle. Between most major levels, Tak is challenged to a series of mini- games (which can also be played by two players) by the Juju guardians of the Big Gs in order to receive additional magical powers to help him defeat them, which can then be activated usually in context-sensitive areas during specific levels. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

It consists of a small temple to Tepoztƒìcatl, the Aztec god of the alcoholic beverage pulque.Canto Aguilar 1998 In the middle Postclassic Period, various terraces and a small pyramid were built on one of the peaks of the Sierra de Tepoztlan, overlooking the pre-Columbian town of Tepoztlan. The temple became important enough to attract pilgrims from as far away as Guatemala, although the cult of Tepoztecatl was local to this site.Adams 1996, p.360. Description The temple itself stands at the western side of the site. It consists of a 6.4-meter-high platform supporting a 3.3-meter-high temple base. Upon this stand the remains of the temple building, the remains of which now stand 2.7 meters high. The temple was formed of two rooms. The first room opened onto the temple stairs, with two pillars flanking the entrance. In the centre of this room a small hollow was found, containing traces of charcoal and copal.El Tepozteco at INAH The entry to the small inner sanctum was also flanked by two pillars. The sculpture of Tepoztecatl was probably kept in this room. The temple was modified several times during its history. The first consisted of a narrowing of the entrance to the inner sanctum by building flanking walls against the formerly free-standing inner pillars. The second, and most important, modification was the addition of stone benches and a small projecting cornice. On the cornice are bas-reliefs of the glyphs of the 20 days of the sacred tonalpohualli calendar. Dwellings were built on the terraces on the eastern side of the site in order to house the resident priests and their helpers. Interpretations Sculpted glyphs on the stone bench inside the temple shrine In the ruins of the temple were found two fallen stones with glyphs, one stone bears the name of the eighth Aztec emperor Ahuizotl, the other with the calendrical date \\"10 rabbit\\". This date represents the year 1502 A.D., the year that this emperor died. From this, some archeologists have concluded that this was the year in which the temple was built, others suggest that these stones were added later to commemorate the death of the Aztec emperor. Some glyphs include a turquoise crown and a shield with arrows, which have led investigators to conclude that the benches were built by the Triple Alliance some time after 1452 A.D., the year when the Alliance conquered Tepoztlan.Matos Moctezuma & Solis Olgu√≠n 2002, p.450.

() gravity is actually a family of theories, each one defined by a different function, , of the Ricci scalar, . The simplest case is just the function being equal to the scalar; this is general relativity. As a consequence of introducing an arbitrary function, there may be freedom to explain the accelerated expansion and structure formation of the Universe without adding unknown forms of dark energy or dark matter. Some functional forms may be inspired by corrections arising from a quantum theory of gravity. () gravity was first proposed in 1970 by Hans Adolph Buchdahl (although was used rather than for the name of the arbitrary function). It has become an active field of research following work by Starobinsky on cosmic inflation. A wide range of phenomena can be produced from this theory by adopting different functions; however, many functional forms can now be ruled out on observational grounds, or because of pathological theoretical problems. Introduction In () gravity, one seeks to generalize the Lagrangian of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action: to where \\\\kappa=\\\\tfrac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4}, g = \\\\det g_{\\\\mu u} is the determinant of the metric tensor, and f(R) is some function of the Ricci scalar. Metric () gravity =Derivation of field equations= In metric () gravity, one arrives at the field equations by varying with respect to the metric and not treating the connection independently. For completeness we will now briefly mention the basic steps of the variation of the action. The main steps are the same as in the case of the variation of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action (see the article for more details) but there are also some important differences. The variation of the determinant is as always: The Ricci scalar is defined as Therefore, its variation with respect to the inverse metric g^{\\\\mu u} is given by For the second step see the article about the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action. Since \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu u}is the difference of two connections, it should transform as a tensor. Therefore, it can be written as Substituting into the equation above: where abla_\\\\muis the covariant derivative and \\\\square = g^{\\\\mu u} abla_\\\\mu abla_ u is the D'Alembert operator. Denoting F(R) = \\\\frac{df}{d R}, the variation in the action reads: Doing integration by parts on the second and third terms (and neglected the boundary contributions), we get: By demanding that the action remains invariant under variations of the metric, \\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}}=0, one obtains the field equations: where T_{\\\\mu u}is the energy‚Äìmomentum tensor defined as \\\\frac{\\\\delta(\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\mathcal L_\\\\mathrm{m})}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}},}} where \\\\mathcal L_mis the matter Lagrangian. = The generalized Friedmann equations = Assuming a Robertson‚ÄìWalker metric with scale factor a(t) we can find the generalized Friedmann equations to be (in units where \\\\kappa = 1): where {a},}} the dot is the derivative with respect to the cosmic time , and the terms m and rad represent the matter and radiation densities respectively; these satisfy the continuity equations: =Modified Newton's constant= An interesting feature of these theories is the fact that the gravitational constant is time and scale dependent. To see this, add a small scalar perturbation to the metric (in the Newtonian gauge): where and are the Newtonian potentials and use the field equations to first order. After some lengthy calculations, one can define a Poisson equation in the Fourier space and attribute the extra terms that appear on the right hand side to an effective gravitational constant eff. Doing so, we get the gravitational potential (valid on sub-horizon scales ): where m is a perturbation in the matter density, is the Fourier scale and eff is: with {F}.}} = Massive gravitational waves = This class of theories when linearized exhibits three polarization modes for the gravitational waves, of which two correspond to the massless graviton (helicities ¬±2) and the third (scalar) is coming from the fact that if we take into account a conformal transformation, the fourth order theory () becomes general relativity plus a scalar field. To see this, identify and use the field equations above to get Working to first order of perturbation theory: and after some tedious algebra, one can solve for the metric perturbation, which corresponds to the gravitational waves. A particular frequency component, for a wave propagating in the -direction, may be written as where and g() = d/d is the group velocity of a wave packet centred on wave-vector . The first two terms correspond to the usual transverse polarizations from general relativity, while the third corresponds to the new massive polarization mode of () theories. The transverse modes propagate at the speed of light, but the scalar mode moves at a speed G < 1 (in units where = 1), this mode is dispersive.  Equivalent formalism  Under certain additional conditions we can simplify the analysis of () theories by introducing an auxiliary field . Assuming f(R) eq 0 for all , let () be the Legendre transformation of () so that \\\\Phi = f'(R) and R=V'(\\\\Phi). Then, one obtains the O'Hanlon (1972) action: \\\\right].}} We have the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations Eliminating , we obtain exactly the same equations as before. However, the equations are only second order in the derivatives, instead of fourth order. We are currently working with the Jordan frame. By performing a conformal rescaling we transform to the Einstein frame: \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa}\\\\left[ \\\\tilde{R} - \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\tilde{ abla}\\\\Phi}{\\\\Phi} \\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{V(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi^2} \\\\right]}} after integrating by parts. Defining \\\\tilde{\\\\Phi} = \\\\sqrt{3} \\\\ln{\\\\Phi}, and substituting \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa}\\\\left[ \\\\tilde{R} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\tilde{ abla}\\\\tilde{\\\\Phi}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\tilde{V}(\\\\tilde{\\\\Phi}) \\\\right] :\\\\tilde{V}(\\\\tilde{\\\\Phi}) = e^{-\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\tilde{\\\\Phi}} V \\\\left (e^{\\\\tilde{\\\\Phi}/\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\right ).}} This is general relativity coupled to a real scalar field: using () theories to describe the accelerating universe is practically equivalent to using quintessence. (At least, equivalent up to the caveat that we have not yet specified matter couplings, so (for example) () gravity in which matter is minimally coupled to the metric (i.e., in Jordan frame) is equivalent to a quintessence theory in which the scalar field mediates a fifth force with gravitational strength.) Palatini () gravity In Palatini () gravity, one treats the metric and connection independently and varies the action with respect to each of them separately. The matter Lagrangian is assumed to be independent of the connection. These theories have been shown to be equivalent to Brans‚ÄìDicke theory with . Due to the structure of the theory, however, Palatini () theories appear to be in conflict with the Standard Model, may violate Solar system experiments, and seem to create unwanted singularities. Metric-affine () gravity In metric- affine () gravity, one generalizes things even further, treating both the metric and connection independently, and assuming the matter Lagrangian depends on the connection as well. Observational tests As there are many potential forms of () gravity, it is difficult to find generic tests. Additionally, since deviations away from General Relativity can be made arbitrarily small in some cases, it is impossible to conclusively exclude some modifications. Some progress can be made, without assuming a concrete form for the function () by Taylor expanding The first term is like the cosmological constant and must be small. The next coefficient 1 can be set to one as in general relativity. For metric () gravity (as opposed to Palatini or metric- affine () gravity), the quadratic term is best constrained by fifth force measurements, since it leads to a Yukawa correction to the gravitational potential. The best current bounds are or equivalently The parameterized post-Newtonian formalism is designed to be able to constrain generic modified theories of gravity. However, () gravity shares many of the same values as General Relativity, and is therefore indistinguishable using these tests. In particular light deflection is unchanged, so () gravity, like General Relativity, is entirely consistent with the bounds from Cassini tracking. Starobinsky gravity Starobinsky gravity has the following form where M has the dimensions of mass.  Tensorial generalization  () gravity as presented in the previous sections is a scalar modification of general relativity. More generally, we can have a coupling involving invariants of the Ricci tensor and the Weyl tensor. Special cases are () gravity, conformal gravity, Gauss‚ÄìBonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. Notice that with any nontrivial tensorial dependence, we typically have additional massive spin-2 degrees of freedom, in addition to the massless graviton and a massive scalar. An exception is Gauss‚ÄìBonnet gravity where the fourth order terms for the spin-2 components cancel out.

Approximately 667 people live there (2007). It is about 30 kilometres (20 mi) from Prague. Other towns close to Svina≈ôov are Libu≈°√≠n, Kladno, Smeƒçno and Slan√Ω. The village is connected with the nearby towns and villages by bus. Svina≈ôov has its own association football team and a team of firemen volunteers. Next to the cemetery, is a little chapel with a statue of St. Mary and Jesus from the 17th century. History The first official mention of Svina≈ôov dates to 1328, when the village was sold by Bo≈ôita z ≈òedho≈°tƒõ to the Vy≈°ehrad canon. So it belonged to the Vy≈°ehrad chapter house. It is probable that there was some kind of settlement much earlier thanks to an archaeological research carried out in a nearby town of Libu≈°√≠n which proved that the area was inhabited in the 6th‚Äì7th centuries. The existence of Svina≈ôov was closely connected with the fort of Libu≈°√≠n. As the name suggests (Svina≈ôov in Czech language can mean that there were either swine or vineyards), Svina≈ôov served as a supplier of agricultural products to the fort. There was a stronghold built around the year 1330. The owner of Svina≈ôov, Vy≈°ehrad chapter house, used to hire out the Svina≈ôov to different tenants till the reign of Wenceslas IV of Bohemia, when the village was sold. Some years later it became a part of property of the Smeƒçno‚Äôs noble family of Martinic and it remained so until the 19th century. The family of Martinic gradually became one of the richest and most powerful noble families in the Czech kingdom. In 1885, Svina≈ôov settlement officially became a village. Most people there earned their living in agriculture, but this changed in the second half of the 19th century with the discovery of coal in the region. Many people from all around the country started to move in and the village started to expand. Most people were therefore employed in the coal industry until the mines closed down in 2002.

Nusbaum () is professor at the University of Chicago, United States in the Department of Psychology and its College, and a steering committee member of the Neuroscience Institute. Nusbaum is an internationally recognized expert in cognitive psychology, speech science, and in the new field of social neuroscience. Nusbaum investigates the cognitive and neural mechanisms that mediate spoken language use, as well as language learning and the role of attention in speech perception. In addition, he investigates how we understand the meaning of music, and how cognitive and social-emotional processes interact in decision-making. Background Nusbaum went to Brandeis University, Massachusetts, and obtained a B.A. in psychology and computer science in 1976. He was awarded Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from SUNY at Buffalo (New York) in 1981. He then worked as a research associate at Indiana University (Bloomington, Indiana), and joined the University of Chicago in 1986, where he is a professor. He served as Chair of the psychology department from 1997-2010. Nusbaum is the co-director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience. Howard Nusbaum has one daughter (Rebecca), and he is married to Anne Henly, the Director of the undergraduate research initiative in psychology at the University of Chicago social science collegiate division. They live in Hyde Park, Chicago with their two Newfoundland boys, Newton and Otto. Academic achievements Nusbaum's scientific endeavor focuses on cognition and social neuroscience, with an emphasis on spoken language, because it is one of the primary ways by which humans interact. Nusbaum's research is concerned with understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that mediate the use of language and that guide much of human interaction. His work on spoken language processing has emphasized the role of learning and attention and working memory using a number of techniques including functional neuroimaging, psychophysiological, and behavioral measures. Much of Nusbaum's research is on the mechanisms of speech perception and production but recent studies have also examined the development of concepts, emotional processing, and social interaction. Notably, Nusbaum has examined the role of sleep in consolidating perceptual learning of speech sounds, the cortical mechanisms that mediate perception of audio-visual speech, the role of gesture in production and comprehension of speech, and how listeners adjust to differences among talkers. Current research projects involve understanding the ability of non-human animals to learn language-like structure, examining the role of sleep in illusory memory and perceptuo-motor learning, the processing of emotional information in lonely people, how we use different dimensions of speech to refer to events, how our expectations change the way we understand sensory information. Nusbaum is also involved in interdisciplinary studies in the new field of neuroeconomics. He served as the principal investigator on various John Templeton grants aiming to develop scholarly investigations into the nature, cultivation, benefits and applications of wisdom. Nusbaum contribution to speech research Despite several decades of concerted effort, research in speech perception has yet to crack the \\"lack of invariance\\" problem: there is a many-to-many mapping between the acoustic patterns and percepts. The acoustic signature of a particular phoneme changes as a function of phonetic context, speaking rate, physical characteristics of talkers, dialect, acoustic environment, and so on. How listeners achieve \\"phonetic constancy\\" despite these sources of variability largely remains a mystery. The modal approach has been to search for invariant cues that have somehow been missed‚Äîthat is, to hypothesize that there is no lack of invariance problem aside from the fact that researchers have not discovered how to detect invariant cues available to listeners. Nusbaum has taken a distinctly contrary position, assuming that the lack of invariance is real rather than apparent, and that the basis for phonetic constancy lies in the processing mechanisms of human speech perception. Nusbaum's early work pioneered the application of cognitive psychological theories of attention and memory to problems in speech perception.,Nusbaum, H. C., & Henly, A. S. (1992). Listening to speech through an adaptive window of analysis. In B. Schouten (Ed.), The processing of speech: From the auditory periphery to word recognition. Berlin: Mouton-De GruyterNusbaum, H. C., & Schwab, E. C. (1986). The role of attention and active processing in speech perception. In E. C. Schwab & H. C. Nusbaum (Eds.), Pattern recognition by humans and machines: Volume 1, Speech Perception. New York: Academic Press Nusbaum's more recent research uses functional neuroimaging techniques to further explore these issues. For instance, he has demonstrated that increased activity in a temporal-parietal network is associated with increased task demands in a multi-talker context,Wong, P. C. M., Nusbaum, H. C., & Small, S. L. (2004). Neural bases of talker normalization. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 16, 1173-1184. and that the time-course of relative activity in auditory and motor area during perception of the McGurk effect is consistent with a model of speech perception in which visual-motor information serves as a kind of feedback to augment (and potentially supplant) auditory representations of speech sounds.Skipper, J. I., van Wassenhove, V., Nusbaum, H. C., & Small, S. L. (2007). Hearing lips and seeing voices: How cortical areas support speech production mediate audiovisual speech perception. Cerebral Cortex, 17, 2387-2399. His work has also shown that two dissociable networks underlie the use of context in sentence recognition,Hasson, U., Nusbaum, H. C., & Small, S. L. (2007). Repetition suppression for spoken sentences and the effect of task demands. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18, 2013-2029. and that sleep serves an important role in the consolidation of generalizations of phonetic knowledge learned opportunistically through exposure to an unfamiliar talker.Fenn, K.

Intergovernmental agreements between Armenia and Iran were signed in 2007 and 2008. On 14 April 2009, energy ministries of Armenia and Iran signed a memorandum on financing construction of the Meghri power station of Armenian side. The dam and power stations construction contract was signed on 16 October 2010 with Farab Sepasad Company. A ceremony on 17 November 2012, attended by Iran's Minister of Energy and the Armenian President, officially began construction. The basic studies were carried out by Arm-Hydroenergo-Project Company and Mahab-E-Qods Consulting Engineers Company in 1999. The Meghri station was to be operated by Iran for 15 years after which it will be returned to Armenia free of charge. However, construction has been delayed. As of 2017, the Armenian government‚Äôs Deputy Minister of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources Hayk Harutyunyanays said \\"Although the agreement has long been in force, the Iranian company has not made any investments to this day, so the governments of Armenia and Iran have to look for another investor.\\" The project is expected to cost US$400 million. Power stations The complex was planned to comprise two hydroelectric power stations ‚Äî Ghare Chiler (also transcribed Gharachilar or Karachinar) on the Iranian side and Meghri on Armenia side. Due to the sufficient difference in elevation and the presence of Aras Dam on the upstream, the power stations will be run-of-river type, wherein water is taken into pipes at a high elevation, carried downslope to powerhouses at lower elevation, then discharged back to the river. Both power station were conceived to have two turbines with a capacity of each. Revised study of river flows now indicates total Meghri generation capacity would be approximately 100 MW.

On 26 April 2014, Scruton station reopened to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the line's closure to passenger services. A special reopening service was run with Leyland railbus LEV1. By November 2014, although restoration of the building was virtually complete a short length of platform was required for construction to bring it into compliance with modern regulations which require platforms to be at least . The station did not operate until the Wensleydale's eastern terminus at was completed and opened to the public on 22 November 2014.

Its construction was inspired by designs of a never-built project conceived by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright. As conceived it was known as the \\"Chahroudi House\\" for the client who commissioned it, Ahmed \\"A. K.\\" Chahroudi; as built it gained the name of its owner, Joseph Massaro. Due to a running dispute with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and subsequent out-of-court settlement the home can only be described as being \\"inspired by Wright\\" rather than a faithfully rendered, certified Wright design. Concept In 1949, architect Frank Lloyd Wright received a commission from Ahmed Chahroudi to build a house on a island the engineer owned in Lake Mahopac, Petre (historically spelled \\"Petra\\", from the Latin for \\"rock\\", reflecting the prominence where the home was to be constructed). Chahroudi would later state that during a lunch meeting with Wright and Edgar Kaufmann, the owner of Wright‚Äôs celebrated Fallingwater, the architect told Kaufmann: \\"When I finish the house on the island, it will surpass your Fallingwater\\". Wright worked on designing a one-story, house for three months, but the project was cancelled when Chahroudi realized he would not be able to afford either the $50,000 budget that Wright envisioned for the project or a second more modest version he requested. Instead, he had Wright build a three bedroom guest cottage the architect had designed for the island,\\"Do The Wright Thing\\", Alternative Energy Retailer, August 2007 later occupying it with his family as a summer retreat. Design In 1996, Petre Island was purchased for $700,000 USD by Joseph Massaro, a sheet metal contractor. Though he had seen the original Chahroudi commission drawings for the main home years earlier, he initially intended merely to restore the island‚Äôs Wright-designed guest cottage. Those drawings- a floor plan with ideas for built-in and stand-alone furniture, a building section, and three elevations-were included in his acquisition of the island. He hired Thomas A. Heinz, an architect and Wright historian, to complete the only partially realized design. Heinz employed Archicad Building Information Modeling (BIM) software to model aspects of Wright's design not self-evident in the original renderings. His design also provided updated heating and cooling solutions such as air conditioning and radiant heating that were not part of the original Wright concept. The design as built features chimney caps -- to which Wright characteristically took exception -- at each of the home‚Äôs six fireplaces. In common with Fallingwater, the house‚Äôs design does not merely accommodate but actually incorporates the local topography. A -high, -long rock forms the exterior to the entry and an interior wall, while a smaller rock doubles as a kitchen and bathroom wall. Again, like Fallingwater's signature terraces, the house features a cantilevered deck that stretches over Lake Mahopac. Its -high living area is illuminated with 26 triangular skylights. Massaro sold his sheet metal business in 2000 to focus on building the house, a fluid process that included solutions and adjustments made on the fly between 2003 and 2007. Controversy =Denial of authenticity= Throughout the construction, Massaro was in conflict with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, which had been established by the architect in 1940 to conserve his intellectual property. Massaro told interviewers that the foundation requested $450,000 to render working drawings from Wright's sketches and supervise construction of the house. Instead, Massaro hired Heinz and the foundation filed a lawsuit, which ended in a settlement that limited Massaro to referring to the structure as merely being \\"inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright\\". The foundation refuses to recognize Massaro House as an official Frank Lloyd Wright creation on a number of aesthetic and construction grounds beyond Massaro's refusal to comply with certification. Massaro countered that he believed that Wright would rather the house be built than not built at all. =Criticism of design= Rejection of the house by critics as a Wright design extends beyond the architectural supervision and fees, and includes details of the Massaro House construction. Notably, William Allin Storrer, an adjunct professor of architecture and Wright historian, points to the desert masonry and skylight selection. Additionally, the quality of the roof fascia and a set of missing stairs descending from the cantilevered deck to the shore below that was included in the original design are highlighted as contentious details that should remove the house from consideration as a Wright design. Storrer pointed out that rocks used in the desert masonry project out from the concrete surface on the Massaro House. Wright's signature desert masonry embedded native rocks closely in concrete. In his designs, Storrer claimed, rocks are flush with the face of the concrete, rather than distinct from one-another and randomly applied to otherwise finished walls protruding at odd angles. Evading the aesthetic consequence of design choices made, Massaro countered that of Styrofoam insulation had to be added in order to adhere to modern building codes, resulting in the stones projecting beyond the original dimensions. He claimed that it was a concession even Wright would have been forced to make. As rendered, that claim is untenable. Another signature of Wright's designs is the use of many windows, with the Heinz design for Massaro House including 26 skylights. The skylights chosen and installed in the home are domed, rather than the typically flat Wright designed panels. Massaro pointed out that flat panels are shown to leak, which Storrer conceded is a known issue with Wright designs but countered that solutions exist that would have allowed Massaro to stay true to \\"Wrightian\\" design principles. Homes designed by Wright often incorporate a unique design in the fascia or window frames. To stamp the custom design into the copper to be used for the fascia on the roof, Massaro created a special machine. Wright defenders insist that the design is stamped too lightly and shallowly to satisfy Wright's design standards. Several of Wright's design drawings for Chahroudi include a set of stairs that descend from the cantilevered deck to the rocky shore below, a motif borrowed from Fallingwater, where they descend to the stream that home is built upon, Bear Run. Massaro explained that had the stairs been included in his design they would have descended into of water, disregarding that the flight could have been shortened to accommodate. Status The Massaro House is maintained as a private residence and is not open for the general public. However, Massaro has stated he would make the house available as a fundraising location for nonprofit charitable groups. In November 2012 the property was listed for sale at $20 million USD.Architizer This has been reduced to below $10 million in increments, most recently in 2020.

Built in 1886, it was billed as having the largest stage in New England north of Boston, and continues to serve as a performance venue today. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as \\"Town Hall and Courthouse\\", in 1980, for its architecture and civic roles, and is a contributing property in the Newport Downtown Historic District. Description and history The Newport Opera House is located on the east side of Main Street in downtown Newport. The -story brick building, with its clock and bell tower, is the most prominent feature of Newport's historic downtown. Architecturally the building is of a restrained Queen Anne Victorian style, with Panel Brick elements. Its main block is capped by a hip roof, with a corbelled brick cornice. Trim elements are mainly brick, but are accented with terra cotta panels. Windows on the ground floor are topped by segmented arches, while those on the second story have round-arch tops. The tower projects from the front facade, with the main entrance at its front. It has a belfry stage, which for a time housed the Revere bell that now stands in front of the building. Above the belfry stage the tower has a pyramidal roof from which gabled dormers project that house clock faces. The building was built in 1886 to replace the previous town hall and courthouse which had burned down in 1885. It was designed by Hiram Beckwith, a regionally prominent architect from Claremont. It served for many years as Newport's town hall and as the main courthouse for Sullivan County, and has long served the region as a performance spaceHistory, Newport Opera House Associationhttp://www.newportnh.net/index.php?doc=3_89 The rebuilt Opera House was noted to have the largest stage north of Boston.

He is one of the scientists credited with discovering rhenium, the last element to be discovered having a stable isotope. Rhenium In 1925 in Germany, Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg reported that they detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 gram of the element by processing 660 kg of molybdenite. Technetium The same team was also involved in the discovery of technetium. They reported the discovery of element 75 and element 43 in 1925 and named element 43 masurium (after Masuria in eastern Prussia, now in Poland, the region where Walter Noddack's family originated).Elentymolgy and Elements Multidict, \\"Technetium\\" The group bombarded columbite with a beam of electrons and deduced element 43 was present by examining X-ray diffraction spectrograms. The wavelength of the X-rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by Henry Moseley in 1913. The team claimed to detect a faint X-ray signal at a wavelength produced by element 43. Contemporary experimenters could not replicate the discovery, and it was dismissed as an error for many years.Nies, Kevin A. \\"Ida Tacke and the warfare behind the discovery of fission\\" (2001). In 1998, John T. Armstrong of the National Institute of Standards and Technology performed computer simulations of the 1925 experiments and obtained results quite similar to those reported by the Noddack team. He claimed that this was further supported by work published by David Curtis of the Los Alamos National Laboratory measuring the (tiny) natural occurrence of technetium.Using first-principles X-ray-emission spectral-generation algorithms developed at NIST, I simulated the X-ray spectra that would be expected for Van Assche's initial estimates of the Noddacks' residue compositions. The first results were surprisingly close to their published spectrum! Over the next couple of years, we refined our reconstruction of their analytical methods and performed more sophisticated simulations. The agreement between simulated and reported spectra improved further. Our calculation of the amount of element 43 required to produce their spectrum is quite similar to the direct measurements of natural technetium abundance in uranium ore published in 1999 by Dave Curtis and colleagues at Los Alamos. We can find no other plausible explanation for the Noddacks' data than that they did indeed detect fission \\"masurium.#Armstrong, John T. \\"Technetium\\" Chemical & Engineering News (2003). Noddack's experimental results have never been reproduced, and they were unable to isolate any element 43. Debate still exists as to whether the 1925 team discovered element 43. Discovery of element 43 was finally confirmed by a 1937 experiment in Sicily.

The mountain lies in the canton of Schwyz, to the east of the town of Schwyz, and to the south of the village of Alpthal in the valley of the river Alp. It is accessible from the Holzegg by a hiking trail which is opened during the summer months only. Geologically the Mythen is a penninic Klippe. The name is pronounced [ÀàmiÀêt…ôn]; it is in origin the plural referring to the Grosser and Kleiner Mythen collectively, each of which had the name Mythe (feminine) in the singular. The name is unrelated to the now-homographic German word for \\"myth\\"; Weibel (1973) derives it from Latin meta \\"cone, pyramid\\". Until the late 19th century, the name of the mountain was still feminine, die Grosse Mythe; after c. 1870, the masculine gender became increasingly common in written German although dialectically the feminine remains current.Viktor Weibel, 'Namenkunde des Landes Schwyz.

Course  The Oder rises in the district of Goslar in the heart of the Harz Mountains. Its source is located in the southern part of the Brockenfeld about north of the Achtermannsh√∂he. The river's source is called the Odersprung or \\"Oder Leap.\\" On the Brockenfeld, which is close to the Odersprung, the rivers Abbe, Gro√üe Bode, Ecker and Kalte Bode also have their respective origins. On its perimeter is the ancient Dreieckiger Pfahl boundary stone. After the Oder passed under the B 4 federal highway in in east-west direction, it is impounded for the first time west of the village in the Oderteich, where it bends to the south. A few kilometres further downstream, the river is impounded for the second time not far southwest of Oder Valley Sawmill (Odertaler S√§gem√ºhle) by the barrage of the Oder Dam. Thereafter the river flows through Bad Lauterberg and leaves the Harz. In Bad Lauterberg the Oder swings west, running through P√∂hlde and Hattorf am Harz, passing north of the Rotenberg ridge, and reaches Wulften.

However, the Type 33 was an obsolete design and the Romanian government decided to purchase Soviet equipment. A was acquired in 1984 for $61.5 million from USSR. The submarine was built by Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112 in Gorki. The Romanian crew of the submarine was trained in the USSR. The submarine, christened Delfinul, was delivered in 1985. Another two Kilo- class submarines were planned for purchase, but due to financial reasons, the orders were cancelled.  Service  The submarine successfully accomplished 67 missions, with 2,000 hours of immersion.Almanahul For»õelor Navale 2007, p. 86 During these missions, Delfinul launched 23 torpedoes and 2 naval mines.

This family includes the slipper snails (Crepidula), hat snails (Calyptraea), spiny slipper snails (Bostrycapulus), and cup-and-saucer snails (Crucibulum) as well as Crepipatella, Siphopatella, Grandicrepidula, and Maoricrypta.Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S. (2011). Crepidula Lamarck, 1799. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=137722 on 2011-05-21 These recent changes in the definition of Crepidula are based on both DNA sequence data as well as anatomical work. Dissections of various calyptraeids show that species that are now placed in Grandicrepidula and Maoricrypta are anatomically very different from the true Crepidula. If only the shells are examined this difference is not apparent. This distinction is supported by DNA sequence data from 3 genes (COI, 16S and 28S).Collin, Rachel. 2003. The Utility of Morphological Characters in Gastropod Phylogenetics: An Example From the Calyptraeidae. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 4: 541‚Äì593 The genus Crepidula is probably the best studied group within the calyptraeids. A variety of species are commonly used in developmental, ecological, and behavioral research.Henry, Jonathan J.; Collin, Rachel; Perry, Kimberly J.. 2010. The Slipper Snail, Crepidula: An emerging Lophotrochozoan model system. Biological Bulletin, 218(3): 211-229. They have been the major focus of research on protandrous sex-change in marine invertebrates and have been used to demonstrate that sex change is environmentally mediated (the timing of sex change depends on association with other individual snails).M√©rot, Claire; Collin, Rachel. 2012.

Sex, size, and position: a test of models predicting size at sex change in the protandrous gastropod crepidula fornicata. The American Naturalist, 146(6): 815-831. Crepidula fornicata and Crepidula onyx are well-studied examples of invasive, exotic species in marine habitats.Coe, Wesley R. 1948. Nutrition and sexuality in protandric gastropods of the genus Crepidula. Biol. Bul. 94(3): 158-160.Hendler, G. and D. R. Franz. 1971. Population dynamics and life history of Crepidula convexa Say (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) in Delaware Bay. Biol. Bul. 141: 514-526. Due to their simple shells and plastic morphology, calyptraeid taxonomy is challenging. In many cases distinct species with similar-looking shells have been lumped into a single species with either global or unusual distributions. In these cases close examination of the mode of development or of DNA data is vital to verify the species identity. Because such taxonomic lumping is difficult to clear from the internet or from the literature many species range estimates available on the internet include dubious data or data from species that have been taken out of synonymy.

Adults use their large gill to capture microalgae from suspension, but there is some evidence that small juveniles can also use the radula to scrape algae from the substrate. Introduced and invasive Crepidula species Crepidula fornicata - Native to the east coast of North America and ranging from Florida north into Canada. This species is now widespread and considered highly invasive along the north coast of Spain and France, along much of England's coastline and into the North Sea. It has also been reported from San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound and the Mediterranean Sea. Crepidula convexa - Native to the east coast of North America and ranging from South Carolina to New England. This species has been reported from Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay. Crepidula onyx - Native to the Southern coast of California and northern Pacific coast of Mexico. This species is now widespread and considered highly invasive in Asia. It has been reported from Korea, Japan and Hong Kong. References *Collin, R. 2003.

Robinson was freelance photographer for Vogue and The New York Times from the 1950s to the early 1970s before he left New York to return home to the American South and pursue a career as a stained glass designer. Photography career Jack Uther Robinson Jr. was born in Meridian, Mississippi on September 18, 1928 to Jack Robinson, Sr. and Euline Jones Robinson. The family soon moved to Clarksdale, Mississippi, where Jack attended Clarksdale public school and graduated in 1946. In Clarkesdale Robinson is said to have been somewhat shy and reclusive, often choosing to stay at home and paint and draw rather than socialize with peers. It was during those years that he began to develop a talent for photography. Late in 1946 Robinson left Clarksdale to attend Tulane University in New Orleans, initially planning to pursue a career in medicine.Marilyn Sadler. \\"The Secret Life of Jack Robinson,\\" Memphis Magazine. Vol. 27, No.9. Dec. 2002. Memphis, p. 34-48. It was in New Orleans that Robinson began his career in photography. Much of his early work was shot in the French Quarter where he documented street scenes and vibrant nightlife. He frequented Dixie's Bar of Music,\\"Jack Robinson Biography.\\" Jack Robinson Archive. Oct. 29, 2008. a Bourbon Street club which was a center of the New Orleans gay community in the 1950s and 1960s,Sarah Wilkerson-Freeman. \\"Fat Tuesday at Dixie's: Jack Robinson's New Orleans Mardi Gras Photographs, 1952-1955.\\" Southern Cultures.

Oct. 29, 2008. . During this period he refined his talent as a photographer, capturing portraits of notable figures of the southern bohemian art and culture scene in New Orleans, and documenting the gay community's involvement in Mardi Gras.Sadler This involvement would segue into the formation of the first gay Carnival krewe, the Krewe of Yuga in 1958.Howard Philips Smith. Unveiling the Muse: The Lost History of Gay Carnival in New Orleans. (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2017) In the summer of 1954 Robinson travelled to Mexico with Betty Parsons (the famous New York art dealer), Dusti Bong√©J. Richard Gruber. Dusti Bong√© Art and Life: Biloxi, New Orleans, New York (Biloxi: Dusti Bong√© Foundation, 2019) (Abstract Expressionist painter), and his partner Gabriel, and photographed scenes of Mexican life.Lee Hall. Betty Parsons: Artist, Dealer, Collector. (New York: Harry Abrams Inc., 1991) At Parsons' encouragement, he moved to New York probably in the spring of 1955 to pursue a career in fashion photography. He was quickly recognized as an emerging talent and was sought out by top designers in the fashion industry. In 1959 he shot his first major cover for a fashion special for Life Magazine. In the late 1950s he began free-lancing for the New York Times under style editor Carrie Donovan. His relationship with Donovan proved to be important for Robinson. When she left the newspaper in 1965 to work for Vogue, she brought Robinson with her. At Vogue Robinson shot regularly for the running sections \\"Vogue's own Boutique,\\" a monthly feature that utilized celebrities as models in various boutiques around New York, and \\"People are Talking About,\\" a feature that profiled up and coming personalities in arts, entertainment, and politics. Additionally, he contributed photographs to many other Vogue articles. It was at Vogue that Robinson photographed many of his most famous subjects including Elton John, Joni Mitchell, Jack Nicholson, and Cher. Robinson remained at Vogue for the duration of his time in New York, amassing a large body of work between 1965 and 1973.Jack Robinson Archive. Oct. 29, 2008. \\"Jack Robinson Biography.\\" Jack Robinson Archive. Oct. 29, 2008. . Robinson's career as a photographer was not, however, to continue past the early 1970s. In the late 1960s he began frequenting Andy Warhol's Factory in Manhattan and his lifestyle gradually shifted towards the excesses that were typical of the Factory scene of the era. By 1972 he had developed a serious drinking problem and his professional career and financial stability began to unravel as a result. By the end of 1972 Robinson's once steady flow of work had slowed to a trickle. Facing financial problems he left New York and moved south to Memphis, Tennessee. His career as a professional photographer was over, and it was a part of his life that Robinson would seldom speak of in years to come. He became an intensely private person. For reasons not at all clear, he seemed determined to remain anonymous. He once confided in a friend that \\"he wanted a coffee table book after he was dead, but he just didn't want any limelight while he was alive.\\"\\"Who Was Jack Robinson?\\" MAO MAG. Vol. 1, Issue 9. Spring 2008. New York, p.67. Stained glass career Back in Memphis Robinson pulled his life back together. He joined Alcoholics Anonymous, quit drinking, and began working for a local stained glass studio. His primary work was in designing church windows, which can be seen today in churches across the American South. His most notable achievement in the stained glass field was winning the international competition for the design and fabrication of the stained glass windows in the Danny Thomas chapel at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Legacy By the early 1970s Jack had established himself as one of the leading fashion and portrait photographers in the world. In 1974, Vogue unveiled a retrospective of \\"50 Years of Women in Vogue\\". Newsweek magazine covered the show and printed a two-page spread that featured six photographs: one by Richard Avedon, two by Irving Penn, one by George Hoyningen-Huene, one by Edward Steichen, and one by Jack Robinson.\\"50 Years of Women in Vogue.\\" Newsweek. Vol. 134, No.18. Oct. 28, 1974. New York. Robinson's work was clearly regarded as among the best of his contemporaries. In 2007, New York fashion magazine MAO MAG published an article entitled \\"Who was Jack Robinson?\\" in which they profiled Robinson and his career. They wrote: > In his 17 year career, Jack Robinson was one of the editorial world's most > accomplished photographers (in fact, one of Diana Vreeland's favorites) and > had exclusive access to film actors, music stars, fashion designers, > artists, sports figures, politicians, and socialites via his assignments for > Vogue, The New York Times, and Life but his self exile from New York in 1973 > and his determination never to talk about his prolific past continues to > shroud his career in mystery.MAO Mag Today, Robinson is being recognized posthumously for his talent, and his work has been shown in galleries around the world including Staley-Wise Gallery in New York, Getty Gallery in London, and Bryant Gallery in New Orleans.Howard Philips Smith.

Shell and user interface Windows 7 retains the Windows Aero graphical user interface and visual style introduced in its predecessor, Windows Vista, but many areas have seen enhancements. Unlike Windows Vista, window borders and the taskbar do not turn opaque when a window is maximized while Windows Aero is active; instead, they remain translucent. =Desktop= The Desktop Slideshow feature in Windows 7. Themes Support for themes has been extended in Windows 7. In addition to providing options to customize colors of window chrome and other aspects of the interface including the desktop background, icons, mouse cursors, and sound schemes, the operating system also includes a native desktop slideshow feature. A new theme pack extension has been introduced, \`.themepack\`, which is essentially a collection of cabinet files that consist of theme resources including background images, color preferences, desktop icons, mouse cursors, and sound schemes. The new theme extension simplifies sharing of themes and can also display desktop wallpapers via RSS feeds provided by the Windows RSS Platform. Microsoft provides additional themes for free through its website. The default theme in Windows 7 consists of a single desktop wallpaper named \\"Harmony\\" and the default desktop icons, mouse cursors, and sound scheme introduced in Windows Vista; however, none of the desktop backgrounds included with Windows Vista are present in Windows 7. New themes include Architecture, Characters, Landscapes, Nature, and Scenes, and an additional country-specific theme that is determined based on the defined locale when the operating system is installed; although only the theme for a user's home country is displayed within the user interface, the files for all of these other country-specific themes are included in the operating system. All themes included in Windows 7‚Äîexcluding the default theme‚Äîinclude six wallpaper images. A number of new sound schemes (each associated with an included theme) have also been introduced: Afternoon, Calligraphy, Characters, Cityscape, Delta, Festival, Garden, Heritage, Landscape, Quirky, Raga, Savana, and Sonata. Themes may introduce their own custom sounds, which can be used with others themes as well. Desktop Slideshow Windows 7 introduces a desktop slideshow feature that periodically changes the desktop wallpaper based on a user-defined interval; the change is accompanied by a smooth fade transition with a duration that can be customized via the Windows Registry. The desktop slideshow feature supports local images and images obtained via RSS. Gadgets With Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced gadgets to display information such as image slideshows and RSS feeds on the user's desktop; the gadgets could optionally be displayed on a sidebar docked to a side of the screen. In Windows 7, the sidebar has been removed, but gadgets can still be placed on the desktop. Gadgets can be brought to the foreground on top of active applications by pressing . Several new features for gadgets are introduced, including new desktop context menu options to access gadgets and hide all active gadgets; high DPI support; and a feature that can automatically rearrange a gadget based on the position of other gadgets. Additional new features include cached gadget content; optimizations for touch-based devices; and a gadget for Windows Media Center. Gadgets are more closely integrated with Windows Explorer, but the gadgets themselves continue to operate in a single \`sidebar.exe\` process, unlike in Windows Vista where gadgets could operate in multiple \`sidebar.exe\` processes. Active gadgets can also be hidden via a new desktop menu option; Microsoft has stated that this option can result in power-saving benefits. Branding and customization For original equipment manufacturers and enterprises, Windows 7 natively supports the ability to customize the wallpaper that is displayed during user login. Because the settings to change the wallpaper are available via the Windows Registry, users can also customize this wallpaper. Options to customize the appearance of interface lighting and shadows are also available. =Windows Explorer= Windows Explorer's revised user interface Libraries Windows Explorer in Windows 7 supports file libraries that aggregate content from various locations ‚Äì including shared folders on networked systems if the shared folder has been indexed by the host system ‚Äì and present them in a unified view. The libraries hide the actual location the file is stored in. Searching in a library automatically federates the query to the remote systems, in addition to searching on the local system, so that files on the remote systems are also searched. Unlike search folders, Libraries are backed by a physical location which allows files to be saved in the Libraries. Such files are transparently saved in the backing physical folder. The default save location for a library may be configured by the user, as can the default view layout for each library. Libraries are generally stored in the Libraries special folder, which allows them to be displayed on the navigation pane. By default, a new user account in Windows 7 contains four libraries for different file types: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. They are configured to include the user's profile folders for these respective file types, as well as the computer's corresponding Public folders. The Public folder also contains a hidden Recorded TV library that appears in the Windows Explorer sidepane when TV is set up in Media Center for the first time. In addition to aggregating multiple storage locations, Libraries enable Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions. Arrangement Views allow you to pivot your view of the library's contents based on metadata. For example, selecting the \\"By Month\\" view in the Pictures library will display photos in stacks, where each stack represents a month of photos based on the date they were taken. In the Music library, the \\"By Artist\\" view will display stacks of albums from the artists in your collection, and browsing into an artist stack will then display the relevant albums. Search Filter Suggestions are a new feature of the Windows 7 Explorer's search box. When the user clicks in the search box, a menu shows up below it showing recent searches as well as suggested Advanced Query Syntax filters that the user can type. When one is selected (or typed in manually), the menu will update to show the possible values to filter by for that property, and this list is based on the current location and other parts of the query already typed. For example, selecting the \\"tags\\" filter or typing \\"tags:\\" into the search box will display the list of possible tag values which will return search results. Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions are database-backed features which require that all locations in the Library be indexed by the Windows Search service. Local disk locations must be indexed by the local indexer, and Windows Explorer will automatically add locations to the indexing scope when they are included in a library. Remote locations can be indexed by the indexer on another Windows 7 machine, on a Windows machine running Windows Search 4 (such as Windows Vista or Windows Home Server), or on another device that implements the MS-WSP remote query protocol. Federated search Windows Explorer also supports federating search to external data sources, such as custom databases or web services, that are exposed over the web and described via an OpenSearch definition. The federated location description (called a Search Connector) is provided as a \`.osdx\` file. Once installed, the data source becomes queryable directly from Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer features, such as previews and thumbnails, work with the results of a federated search as well. Miscellaneous shell enhancements Windows Explorer has received numerous minor enhancements that improve its overall functionality. The Explorer's search box and the address bar can be resized. Folders such as those on the desktop or user profile folders can be hidden in the navigation pane to reduce clutter. A new Content view is added, which shows thumbnails and metadata together. A new button to toggle the Preview Pane has been added to the toolbar. The button to create a new folder has been moved from the Organize menu and onto the toolbar. List view provides more space between items than in Windows Vista. Finally, storage space consumption bars that were only present for hard disks in Windows Vista are now shown for removable storage devices. Other areas of the shell have also received similar fine- tunings: Progress bars and overlay icons may now appear on an application's button on the taskbar to better alert the user of the status of the application or the work in progress. File types for which property handlers or iFilters are installed are re-indexed by default. Previously, adding submenus to shell context menus or customizing the context menu's behavior for a certain folder was only possible by installing a form of plug-in known as shell extensions. In Windows 7 however, computer-savvy users can do so by editing Windows Registry and/or desktop.ini files. Additionally, a new shell API was introduced designed to simplify the writing of context menu shell extensions by software developers. Windows 7 includes native support for burning ISO files. The functionality is available when a user selects the Burn disc image option within the context menu of an ISO file. Support for disc image verification is also included. In previous versions of Windows, users were required to install-third party software to burn ISO images. =Start menu= The start orb now has a fade-in highlight effect when the user hovers the mouse cursor over it. The Start Menu's right column is now the Aero glass color. In Windows Vista, it was always black. The search results pane in Windows 7, demonstrating a search for the word \\"wireless\\". Windows 7's Start menu retains the two-column layout of its predecessors, with several functional changes: * The \\"Documents\\", \\"Pictures\\" and \\"Music\\" buttons now link to the Libraries of the same name. * A \\"Devices and Printers\\" option has been added that displays a new device manager. * The \\"shut down\\" icon in Windows Vista has been replaced with a text link indicating what action will be taken when the icon is clicked. The default action (switch user, log off, lock, restart, sleep, hibernate or shut down) to take is now configurable through the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties window. * Taskbar Jump Lists are presented in the Start Menu via a guillemet; when the user moves the mouse cursor over the guillemet, or presses the right-arrow key, the right-hand side of the Start menu is widened and replaced with the application's Jump List. * Links to the \\"Videos\\", \\"Downloads\\", and \\"Recorded TV\\", the Connect To menu, the Homegroup and Network menus, the Favorites and Recent Items folders and menus can now be added to the Start menu, and the Administrative Tools folder can be added to the All Programs menu. The Start Search field, introduced in Windows Vista, has been extended to support searching for keywords of Control Panel items. For example, clicking the Start button then typing \\"wireless\\" will show Control Panel options related to configuring and connecting to wireless network, adding Bluetooth devices, and troubleshooting. Group Policy settings for Windows Explorer provide the ability for administrators of an Active Directory domain, or an expert user to add up to five Internet web sites and five additional \\"search connectors\\" to the Search Results view in the Start menu. The links, which appear at the bottom of the pane, allow the search to be executed again on the selected web site or search connector. Microsoft suggests that network administrators could use this feature to enable searching of corporate Intranets or an internal SharePoint server. =Taskbar= The Windows Taskbar has seen its most significant revision since its introduction in Windows 95 and combines the previous Quick Launch functionality with open application window icons. The taskbar is now rendered as an Aero glass element whose color can be changed via the Personalization Control Panel. It is 10 pixels taller than in Windows Vista to accommodate touch screen input and a new larger default icon size (although a smaller taskbar size is available), as well as maintain proportion to newer high resolution monitor modes. Running applications are denoted by a border frame around the icon. Within this border, a color effect (dependent on the predominant RGB value of the icon) that follows the mouse cursor also indicates the opened status of the application. The glass taskbar is more translucent than in Windows Vista. Taskbar buttons show icons by default, not application titles, unless they are set to 'not combine', or 'combine when taskbar is full.' In this case, only icons are shown when the application is not running. Programs running or pinned on the taskbar can be rearranged. Items in the notification area can also be rearranged. Pinned applications The Quick Launch toolbar has been removed from the default configuration, but may be easily added. The Windows 7 taskbar is more application-oriented than window-oriented, and therefore doesn't show window titles (these are shown when an application icon is clicked or hovered over). Applications can now be pinned to the taskbar allowing the user instant access to the applications they commonly use. There are a few ways to pin applications to the taskbar. Icons can be dragged and dropped onto the taskbar, or the application's icon can be right-clicked to pin it to the taskbar. The Windows 7 taskbar shows a preview of the window. Thumbnail previews Thumbnail previews which were introduced in Windows Vista have been expanded to not only preview the windows opened by the application in a small-sized thumbnail view, but to also interact with them. The user can close any window opened by clicking the X on the corresponding thumbnail preview. The name of the window is also shown in the thumbnail preview. A \\"peek\\" at the window is obtained by hovering over the thumbnail preview. Peeking brings up only the window of the thumbnail preview over which the mouse cursor hovers, and turns any other windows on the desktop transparent. This also works for tabs in Internet Explorer: individual tabs may be peeked at in the thumbnail previews. Thumbnail previews integrate Thumbnail Toolbars which can control the application from the thumbnail previews themselves. For example, if Windows Media Player is opened and the mouse cursor is hovering on the application icon, the thumbnail preview will allow the user the ability to Play, Stop, and Play Next/Previous track without having to switch to the Windows Media Player window. Windows Media Player Jump List. Jump lists Jump lists are menu options available by right-clicking a taskbar icon or holding the left mouse button and sliding towards the center of the desktop on an icon. Each application has a jump list corresponding to its features, Microsoft Word's displaying recently opened documents; Windows Media Player's recent tracks and playlists; Internet Explorer's recent browsing history and options for opening new tabs or starting InPrivate Browsing; Windows Live Messenger's common tasks such as instant messaging, signing off, and changing online status. Up to 10 menu items may appear on a list, partially customizable by user. Action Center messages Action Center displaying notification of security threats Task progress Progress bar in taskbar's tasks allows users to know the progress of a task without switching to the pending window. Task progress is used in Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer and third-party software. A testing program using Task progress Notification area The notification area has been redesigned; the standard Volume, Network, Power and Action Center status icons are present, but no other application icons are shown unless the user has chosen them to be shown. A new \\"Notification Area Icons\\" control panel has been added which replaces the \\"Customize Notification Icons\\" dialog box in the \\"Taskbar and Start Menu Properties\\" window first introduced in Windows XP. In addition to being able to configure whether the application icons are shown, the ability to hide each application's notification balloons has been added. The user can then view the notifications at a later time. A triangle to the left of the visible notification icons displays the hidden notification icons. Unlike Windows Vista and Windows XP, the hidden icons are displayed in a window above the taskbar, instead of on the taskbar. Icons can be dragged between this window and the notification area. Windows 7 desktop displayed through Peek. Aero Peek In previous versions of Windows, the taskbar ended with the notification area on the right-hand side. Windows 7, however, introduces a show desktop button on the far right side of the taskbar which can initiate an Aero Peek feature that makes all open windows translucent when hovered over by a mouse cursor. Clicking this button shows the desktop, and clicking it again brings all windows to focus. The new button replaces the show desktop shortcut located in the Quick Launch toolbar in previous versions of Windows. On touch-based devices, Aero Peek can be initiated by pressing and holding the show desktop button; touching the button itself shows the desktop. The button also increases in width to accommodate being pressed by a finger. =Window management mouse gestures= Aero Snap Windows can be dragged to the top of the screen to maximize them and dragged away to restore them. Dragging a window to the left or right of the screen makes it take up half the screen, allowing the user to tile two windows next to each other. Also, resizing the window to the bottom of the screen or its top will extend the window to full height but retain its width. These features can be disabled via the Ease of Access Center if users do not wish the windows to automatically resize. Aero Shake Aero Shake allows users to clear up any clutter on their screen by shaking (dragging back and forth) a window of their choice with the mouse. All other windows will minimize, while the window the user shook stays active on the screen. When the window is shaken again, they are all restored, similar to desktop preview. Use when you have many open windows on your desktop. This feature will minimize all windows except the one you shake. Click and hold on the title bar of the window you need open and shake the mouse. The window you shake will maximize and all others will be minimized. To restore all windows, shake the mouse again whilst holding on to the title bar of the open window. =Keyboard shortcuts= A variety of new keyboard shortcuts have been introduced. Global keyboard shortcuts: * operates as a keyboard shortcut for Aero Peek. * maximizes the current window. * if current window is maximized, restores it; otherwise minimizes current window. * makes upper and lower edge of current window nearly touch the upper and lower edge of the Windows desktop environment, respectively. * restores the original size of the current window. * snaps the current window to the left edge of the screen. * snaps the current window to the right half of the screen. * and move the current window to the left or right display. * functions as zoom in command wherever applicable. * functions as zoom out command wherever applicable. * turn off zoom once enabled. * operates as a keyboard shortcut for Aero Shake. * View opened application and windows in 3D stack view. * Opens Connect to a Network Projector, which has been updated from previous versions of Windows, and allows one to dictate where the desktop is displayed: on the main monitor, an external display, both; or allows one to display two independent desktops on two separate monitors. Taskbar: * Shift + Click, or Middle click starts a new instance of the application, regardless of whether it's already running. * Ctrl + Shift + Click starts a new instance with Administrator privileges; by default, a User Account Control prompt will be displayed. * Shift + Right-click (or right-clicking the program's thumbnail) shows the titlebar's context menu which, by default, contains \\"Restore\\", \\"Move\\", \\"Size\\", \\"Maximize\\", \\"Minimize\\" and \\"Close\\" commands. If the icon being clicked on is a grouped icon, a specialized context menu with \\"Restore All\\", \\"Minimize All\\", and \\"Close All\\" commands is shown. * Ctrl + Click on a grouped icon cycles between the windows (or tabs) in the group. =Font management= The user interface for font management has been overhauled in Windows 7. As with Windows Vista, the collection of installed fonts is displayed in a Windows Explorer window, but fonts that originate from the same font family appear as icons that are represented as stacks that display font previews within the interface. Windows 7 also introduces the option to hide installed fonts; certain fonts are automatically removed from view based on a user's regional settings. An option to manually hide installed fonts is also available. Hidden fonts remain installed but are not enumerated when an application asks for a list of available fonts, thus reducing the amount of fonts to scroll through within the interface and also reducing memory usage. Windows 7 includes over 40 new fonts, including a new \\"Gabriola\\" font. The dialog box for fonts in Windows 7 has also been updated to display font previews within the interface, which allows users to preview fonts before selecting them. Previous versions of windows only displayed the name of the font. The ClearType Text Tuner which was previously available as a Microsoft Powertoy for earlier Windows versions has been integrated into, and updated for Windows 7. Microsoft would later backport Windows 8 Emoji features to Windows 7. =Devices= There are two major new user interface components for device management in Windows 7, \\"Devices and Printers\\" and \\"Device Stage\\". Both of these are integrated with Windows Explorer, and together provide a simplified view of what devices are connected to the computer, and what capabilities they support. Devices and Printers The new Devices and Printers Control Panel. Custom icons can be downloaded via the Internet. Devices and Printers is a new Control Panel interface that is directly accessible from the Start menu. Unlike the Device Manager Control Panel applet, which is still present, the icons shown on the Devices and Printers screen are limited to components of the system that a non-expert user will recognize as plug-in devices. For example, an external monitor connected to the system will be displayed as a device, but the internal monitor on a laptop will not. Device-specific features are available through the context menu for each device; an external monitor's context menu, for example, provides a link to the \\"Display Settings\\" control panel. This new Control Panel applet also replaces the \\"Printers\\" window in prior versions of Windows; common printer operations such as setting the default printer, installing or removing printers, and configuring properties such as paper size are done through this control panel. Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 introduce print driver isolation, which improves the reliability of the print spooler by running printer drivers in a separate process to the spooler service. If a third party print driver fails while isolated, it does not impact other drivers or the print spooler service. Device Stage A Device Stage window showing available options for a Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 4000. Device Stage provides a centralized location for an externally connected multi-function device to present its functionality to the user. When a device such as a portable music player is connected to the system, the device appears as an icon on the task bar, as well as in Windows Explorer. Windows 7 ships with high-resolution images of a number of popular devices, and is capable of connecting to the Internet to download images of devices it doesn't recognize. Opening the icon presents a window that displays actions relevant to that device. Screenshots of the technology presented by Microsoft suggest that a mobile phone could offer options for two-way synchronization, configuring ring-tones, copying pictures and videos, managing the device in Windows Media Player, and using Windows Explorer to navigate through the device. Other device status information such as free memory and battery life can also be shown. The actual per-device functionality is defined via XML files that are downloaded when the device is first connected to the computer, or are provided by the manufacturer on an installation disc. Mobility enhancements =Multi-touch support= Hilton Locke, who worked on the Tablet PC team at Microsoft, reported on December 11, 2007 that Windows 7 will have new touch features on devices supporting multi-touch. An overview and demonstration of the multi-touch capabilities, including a virtual piano program, a mapping and directions program and a touch-aware version of Microsoft Paint, was given at the All Things Digital Conference on May 27, 2008; a video of the multi-touch capabilities was made available on the web later the same day. =Sensors= Windows 7 introduces native support for sensors, including accelerometer sensors, ambient light sensors, and location-based sensors; the operating system also provides a unified driver model for sensor devices. A notable use of this technology in Windows 7 is the operating system's adaptive display brightness feature, which automatically adjusts the brightness of a compatible computer's display based on environmental light conditions and factors. Gadgets developed for Windows 7 can also display location-based information. Applications for certain sensor capabilities can be developed without the requisite hardware. Because data acquired by some sensors can be considered personally identifiable information, all sensors are disabled by default in Windows 7, and an account in Windows 7 requires administrative permissions to enable a sensor. Sensors also require user consent to share location data. Power management =Battery notification messages= Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows 7 is able to report when a laptop battery is in need of a replacement. The operating system works with design capabilities present in modern laptop batteries to report this information. =Hibernation improvements= The powercfg command enables the customization of the hibernation file size. By default, Windows 7 automatically sets the size of the hibernation file to 75% of a computer's total physical memory. The operating system also compresses the contents of memory during the hibernate process to minimize the possibility that the contents exceeds the default size of the hibernation file. =Power analysis and reporting= Windows 7 introduces a new /Energy parameter for the powercfg command, which generates an HTML report of a computer's energy efficiency and displays information related to devices or settings. =USB suspension= Windows 7 can individually suspend USB hubs and supports selective suspend for all in-box USB class drivers. Graphics =DirectX= * Direct3D 11 is included with Windows 7. It is a strict super-set of Direct3D 10.1, which was introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008. * Direct2D and DirectWrite, new hardware-accelerated vector graphics and font rendering APIs built on top of Direct3D 10 that are intended to replace GDI/GDI+ for screen- oriented native-code graphics and text drawing. They can be used from managed applications with the Windows API Code Pack * Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform (WARP), a software rasterizer component for DirectX that provides all of the capabilities of Direct3D 10.0 and 10.1 in software. * DirectX Video Acceleration-High Definition (DXVA-HD) Direct3D 11, Direct2D, DirectWrite, DXGI 1.1, WARP and several other components are currently available for Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2 by installing the Platform Update for Windows Vista. =Desktop Window Manager= First introduced in Windows Vista, the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) in Windows 7 has been updated to use version 10.1 of Direct3D API, and its performance has been improved significantly. The Desktop Window Manager still requires at least a Direct3D 9-capable video card (supported with new device type introduced with the Direct3D 11 runtime). With a video driver conforming to Windows Display Driver Model v1.1, DXGI kernel in Windows 7 provides 2D hardware acceleration to APIs such as GDI, Direct2D and DirectWrite (though GDI+ was not updated to use this functionality). This allows DWM to use significantly lower amounts of system memory, which do not grow regardless of how many windows are opened, like it was in Windows Vista. Systems equipped with a WDDM 1.0 video card will operate in the same fashion as in Windows Vista, using software-only rendering. The Desktop Window Manager in Windows 7 also adds support for systems using multiple heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors. =Other changes= Support for color depths of 30 and 48 bits is included, along with the wide color gamut scRGB (which for HDMI 1.3 can be converted and output as xvYCC). The video modes supported in Windows 7 are 16-bit sRGB, 24-bit sRGB, 30-bit sRGB, 30-bit with extended color gamut sRGB, and 48-bit scRGB. Each user of Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 has individual DPI settings, rather than the machine having a single setting as in previous versions of Windows. DPI settings can be changed by logging on and off, without needing to restart. File system =Solid state drives= Over time, several technologies have been incorporated into subsequent versions of Windows to improve the performance of the operating system on traditional hard disk drives (HDD) with rotating platters. Since Solid state drives (SSD) differ from mechanical HDDs in some key areas (no moving parts, write amplification, limited number of erase cycles allowed for reliable operation), it is beneficial to disable certain optimizations and add others, specifically for SSDs. Windows 7 incorporates many engineering changes to reduce the frequency of writes and flushes, which benefit SSDs in particular since each write operation wears the flash memory. Windows 7 also makes use of the TRIM command. If supported by the SSD (not implemented on early devices), this optimizes when erase cycles are performed, reducing the need to erase blocks before each write and increasing write performance. Several tools and techniques that were implemented in the past to reduce the impact of the rotational latency of traditional HDDs, most notably disk defragmentation, SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, and application launch prefetching, involve reorganizing (rewriting) the data on the platters. Since SSDs have no moving platters, this reorganization has no advantages, and may instead shorten the life of the solid state memory. Therefore, these tools are by default disabled on SSDs in Windows 7, except for some early generation SSDs that might still benefit. Finally, partitions made with Windows 7's partition-creating tools are created with the SSD's alignment needs in mind, avoiding unwanted systematic write amplification. =Virtual hard disks= The Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows 7 incorporate support for the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file format. VHD files can be mounted as drives, created, and booted from, in the same way as WIM files. Furthermore, an installed version of Windows 7 can be booted and run from a VHD drive, even on non-virtual hardware, thereby providing a new way to multi boot Windows. Some features such as hibernation and BitLocker are not available when booting from VHD. =Disk partitioning= By default, a computer's disk is partitioned into two partitions: one of limited size for booting, BitLocker and running the Windows Recovery Environment and the second with the operating system and user files. =Removable media= Windows 7 has also seen improvements to the Safely Remove Hardware menu, including the ability to eject just one camera card at the same time (from a single hub) and retain the ports for future use without reboot; and the labels of removable media are now also listed, rather than just the drive letter. Windows Explorer now by default only shows memory card reader ports in My Computer if they contain a card. =BitLocker to Go= BitLocker brings encryption support to removable disks such as USB drives. Such devices can be protected by a passphrase, a recovery key, or be automatically unlocked on a computer. Boot performance According to data gathered from the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP), 35% of Vista SP1 installations boot up in 30 seconds or less. The more lengthy boot times on the remainder of the machines are mainly due to some services or programs that are loaded but are not required when the system is first started. Microsoft's Mike Fortin, a distinguished engineer on the Windows team, noted in August 2008 that Microsoft has set aside a team to work solely on the issue, and that team aims to \\"significantly increase the number of systems that experience very good boot times\\". They \\"focused very hard on increasing parallelism of driver initialization\\". Also, Microsoft aims to \\"dramatically reduce\\" the number of system services, along with their demands on processors, storage, and memory. Multimedia =Windows Media Center= Windows Media Center in Windows 7 has retained much of the design and feel of its predecessor, but with a variety of user interface shortcuts and browsing capabilities. Playback of H.264 video both locally and through a Media Center Extender (including the Xbox 360) is supported. Some notable enhancements in Windows 7 Media Center include a new mini guide, a new scrub bar, the option to color code the guide by show type, and internet content that is more tightly integrated with regular TV via the guide. All Windows 7 versions now support up to four tuners of each type (QAM, ATSC, CableCARD, NTSC, etc.). When browsing the media library, items that don't have album art are shown in a range of foreground and background color combinations instead of using white text on a blue background. When the left or right remote control buttons are held down to browse the library quickly, a two-letter prefix of the current album name is prominently shown as a visual aid. The Picture Library includes new slideshow capabilities, and individual pictures can be rated. Also, while browsing a media library, a new column appears at the top named \\"Shared.\\" This allows users to access shared media libraries on other Media Center PCs from directly within Media Center. For television support, the Windows Media Center \\"TV Pack\\" released by Microsoft in 2008 is incorporated into Windows Media Center. This includes support for CableCARD and North American (ATSC) clear QAM tuners, as well as creating lists of favorite stations. A gadget for Windows Media Center is also included. =Format support= Windows 7 includes AVI, WAV, AAC/ADTS file media sinks to read the respective formats, an MPEG-4 file source to read MP4, M4A, M4V, MP4V MOV and 3GP container formats and an MPEG-4 file sink to output to MP4 format. Windows 7 also includes a media source to read MPEG transport stream/BDAV MPEG-2 transport stream (M2TS, MTS, M2T and AVCHD) files. Transcoding (encoding) support is not exposed through any built- in Windows application but codecs are included as Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs). In addition to Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video encoders and decoders, and ASF file sink and file source introduced in Windows Vista, Windows 7 includes an H.264 encoder with Baseline profile level 3 and Main profile support and an AAC Low Complexity (AAC-LC) profile encoder. For playback of various media formats, Windows 7 also introduces an H.264 decoder with Baseline, Main, and High profiles support, up to level 5.1, AAC-LC and HE-AAC v1 (SBR) multichannel, HE-AAC v2 (PS) stereo decoders, MPEG-4 Part 2 Simple Profile and Advanced Simple Profile decoders which includes decoding popular codec implementations such as DivX, Xvid and Nero Digital as well as MJPEG and DV MFT decoders for AVI. Windows Media Player 12 uses the built-in Media Foundation codecs to play these formats by default. Windows 7 also updates the DirectShow filters introduced in Windows Vista for playback of MPEG-2 and Dolby Digital to decode H.264, AAC, HE-AAC v1 and v2 and Dolby Digital Plus (including downmixing to Dolby Digital). Security Action Center, formerly Windows Security Center, now encompasses both security and maintenance. It was called Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds. A new user interface for User Account Control has been introduced, which provides the ability to select four different levels of notifications, one of these notification settings, Default, is new to Windows 7. Geo-tracking capabilities are also available in Windows 7. The feature will be disabled by default. When enabled the user will only have limited control as to which applications can track their location. The Encrypting File System supports Elliptic-curve cryptographic algorithms (ECC) in Windows 7. For backward compatibility with previous releases of Windows, Windows 7 supports a mixed-mode operation of ECC and RSA algorithms. EFS self-signed certificates, when using ECC, will use 256-bit key by default. EFS can be configured to use 1K/2k/4k/8k/16k-bit keys when using self-signed RSA certificates, or 256/384/512-bit keys when using ECC certificates. In Windows Vista, the Protected User-Mode Audio (PUMA) content protection facilities are only available to applications that are running in a Protected Media Path environment. Because only the Media Foundation application programming interface could interact with this environment, a media player application had to be designed to use Media Foundation. In Windows 7, this restriction is lifted. PUMA also incorporates stricter enforcement of \\"Copy Never\\" bits when using Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) copy protection over an S/PDIF connection, as well as with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) over HDMI connections. =Biometrics= Windows 7 includes the new Windows Biometric Framework. This framework consists of a set of components that standardizes the use of fingerprint biometric devices. In prior releases of Microsoft Windows, biometric hardware device manufacturers were required to provide a complete stack of software to support their device, including device drivers, software development kits, and support applications. Microsoft noted in a white paper on the Windows Biometric Framework that the proliferation of these proprietary stacks resulted in compatibility issues, compromised the quality and reliability of the system, and made servicing and maintenance more difficult. By incorporating the core biometric functionality into the operating system, Microsoft aims to bring biometric device support on par with other classes of devices. A new Control Panel called Biometric Device Control Panel is included which provides an interface for deleting stored biometrics information, troubleshooting, and enabling or disabling the types of logins that are allowed using biometrics. Biometrics configuration can also be configured using Group Policy settings. Networking * DirectAccess, a VPN tunnel technology based on IPv6 and IPsec. DirectAccess requires domain-joined machines, Windows Server 2008 R2 on the DirectAccess server, at least Windows Server 2008 domain controllers and a PKI to issue authentication certificates. * BranchCache, a WAN optimization technology.Branch Cache Overview * The Bluetooth stack includes improvements introduced in the Windows Vista Feature Pack for Wireless, namely, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR support and remote wake from S3 or S4 support for self-powered Bluetooth modules.Bluetooth Wireless Technology FAQ * NDIS 6.20 (Network Driver Interface Specification) * WWAN (Mobile broadband) support (driver model based on NDIS miniport driver for CDMA and GSM device interfaces, Connection Manager support and Mobile Broadband COM and COM Interop API). * Wireless Hosted Network capabilities: The Windows 7 wireless LAN service supports two new functions ‚Äì Virtual Wi-Fi, that allows a single wireless network adapter to act like two client devices, or a software- based wireless access point (SoftAP) to act as both a wireless hotspot in infrastructure mode and a wireless client at the same time. This feature is not exposed through the GUI; however the Virtual WiFi Miniport adapter can be installed and enabled for wireless adapters with drivers that support a hosted network by using the command netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow \\"ssid=\\" \\"key=\\" keyusage=persistenttemporary at an elevated command prompt.About the Wireless Hosted Network The wireless SoftAP can afterwards be started using the command netsh wlan start hostednetwork. Windows 7 also supports WPA2-PSK/AES security for the hosted network, but DNS resolution for clients requires it to be used with Internet Connection Sharing or a similar feature. * SMB 2.1, which includes minor performance enhancements over SMB2, such as a new opportunistic locking mechanism. * RDP 7.0 * Background Intelligent Transfer Service 4.0 =HomeGroup= Alongside the workgroup system used by previous versions, Windows 7 adds a new ad hoc home networking system known as HomeGroup. The system uses a password to join computers into the group, and allows users' libraries, along with individual files and folders, to be shared between multiple computers. Only computers running Windows 7 to Windows 10 version 1709 can create or join a HomeGroup; however, users can make files and printers shared in a HomeGroup accessible to Windows XP and Windows Vista through a separate account, dedicated to sharing HomeGroup content, that uses traditional Windows sharing. HomeGroup support was deprecated in Windows 10 and has been removed from Windows 10 version 1803 and later. HomeGroup as a concept is very similar to a feature slated for Windows Vista, known as Castle, which would have made it possible to have an identification service for all members on the network, without a centralized server. HomeGroup is created in response to the need for a simple sharing model for inexperienced users who need to share files without wrestling with user accounts, Security descriptors and share permissions. To that end, Microsoft previously created Simple File Sharing mode in Windows XP that, once enabled, caused all connected computers to be authenticated as Guest. Under this model, either a certain file or folder was shared with anyone who connects to the network (even unauthorized parties who are in range of the wireless network) or was not shared at all. In a HomeGroup, however: #Communication between HomeGroup computers is encrypted with a pre-shared password. #A certain file or folder can be shared with the entire HomeGroup (anyone who joins) or a certain person only. #HomeGroup computers can also be a member of a Windows domain or Windows workgroup at the same time and take advantage of those file sharing mechanisms. #Only computers that support HomeGroup (Windows 7 to Windows 10 version 1709) can join the network. =Windows Firewall= Windows 7 adds support for multiple firewall profiles. The Windows Firewall in Windows Vista dynamically changes which network traffic is allowed or blocked based on the location of the computer (based on which network it is connected to). This approach falls short if the computer is connected to more than one network at the same time (as for a computer with both an Ethernet and a wireless interface). In this case, Vista applies the profile that is more secure to all network connections. This is often not desirable; Windows 7 resolves this by being able to apply a separate firewall profile to each network connection. =DNSSEC= Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 introduce support for Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a set of specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. DNSSEC employs digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of DNS data received from a DNS server, which protect against DNS cache poisoning attacks. Management features Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) Windows 7 contains Windows PowerShell 2.0 out-of-the-box, which is also available as a download to install on older platforms: * Windows Troubleshooting Platform * Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment * PowerShell Remoting Other new management features include: * AppLocker (a set of Group Policy settings that evolved from Software Restriction Policies, to restrict which applications can run on a corporate network, including the ability to restrict based on the application's version number or publisher) * Group Policy Preferences (also available as a download for Windows XP and Windows Vista). * The Windows Automation API (also available as a download for Windows XP and Windows Vista). Upgraded components WordPad in Windows 7 Windows 7 includes Internet Explorer 8, .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.5, Windows Installer 5.0 and a standalone XPS Viewer. Paint, Calculator, Resource Monitor and WordPad have also been updated. Paint features a Ribbon interface similar to the one introduced in Office 2007, and also sports several new features. Calculator has been rewritten, with multiline capabilities including Programmer and Statistics modes, unit conversion, and date calculations. Calculator was also given a graphical facelift, the first since Windows 95 in 1995 and Windows NT 4.0 in 1996. WordPad also features the new Ribbon user interface. WordPad supports Office Open XML and ODF file formats. Resource Monitor includes an improved RAM usage display and supports display of TCP/IP ports being listened to, filtering processes using networking, filtering processes with disk activity and listing and searching process handles (e.g. files used by a process) and loaded modules (files required by an executable file, e.g. DLL files). Microsoft Magnifier, an accessibility utility for low vision users has been dramatically improved. Magnifier now supports the full screen zoom feature, whereas previous Windows versions had the Magnifier attached to the top of the screen in a dock layout. The new full screen feature is enabled by default, however, it requires Windows Aero for the advantage of the full screen zoom feature. If Windows is set to the Windows 7 Basic, Windows Classic, or High Contrast themes, Magnifier will still function like it did in Windows Vista and earlier. Windows Installer 5.0 supports installing and configuring Windows Services, and provides developers with more control over setting permissions during software installation. Neither of these features will be available for prior versions of Windows; custom actions to support these features will continue to be required for Windows Installer packages that need to implement these features. Other features * Windows 7 improves the Tablet PC Input Panel to make faster corrections using new gestures, supports text prediction in the soft keyboard and introduces a new Math Input Panel for inputting math into programs that support MathML. It recognizes handwritten math expressions and formulas. Additional language support for handwriting recognition can be gained by installing the respective MUI pack for that language (also called language pack). * Windows 7 introduces a new Problem Steps Recorder tool that enables users to record their interaction with software for analysis and support. The feature can be used to replicate a problem to show support when and where a problem occurred. * As opposed to the blank start-up screen in Windows Vista, Windows 7's start-up screen consists of an animation featuring four colored light balls (one red, one yellow, one green, and one blue). They twirl around for a few seconds and then join together to form a glowing Windows logo. This only occurs on displays with a vertical resolution of 768 pixels or higher, as the animation is 1024x768. Any screen with a resolution below this displays the same startup screen that Vista used. * The Starter Edition of Windows 7 can run an unlimited number of applications, compared to only 3 in Windows Vista Starter. Microsoft had initially intended to ship Windows 7 Starter Edition with this limitation, but announced after the release of the Release Candidate that this restriction would not be imposed in the final release. * For developers, Windows 7 includes a new networking API with support for building SOAP-based web services in native code (as opposed to .NET-based WCF web services), new features to shorten application install times, reduced UAC prompts, simplified development of installation packages, and improved globalization support through a new Extended Linguistic Services API. * If an application crashes twice in a row, Windows 7 will automatically attempt to apply a shim. If an application fails to install a similar self- correcting fix, a tool that asks some questions about the application launches.Application Self-Healing accessed on Jan 30 2009 * Windows 7 includes an optional TIFF IFilter that enables indexing of TIFF documents by reading them with optical character recognition (OCR), thus making their text content searchable. TIFF iFilter supports Adobe TIFF Revision 6.0 specifications and four compression schemes: LZW, JPEG, CCITT v4, CCITT v6 * The Windows Console now adheres to the current Windows theme, instead of showing controls from the Windows Classic theme. * Games Internet Spades, Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers, which were removed from Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. * Users can disable many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista. The new components which can now be disabled include: Handwriting Recognition, Internet Explorer, Windows DVD Maker, Windows Fax and Scan, Windows Gadget Platform Windows Media Center, Windows Media Player, Windows Search, and the XPS Viewer (with its services). * Windows XP Mode is a fully functioning copy of 32-bit Windows XP Professional SP3 running in a virtual machine in Windows Virtual PC (as opposed to Hyper-V) running on top of Windows 7. Through the use of the RDP protocol, it allows applications incompatible with Windows 7 to be run on the underlying Windows XP virtual machine, but still to appear to be part of the Windows 7 desktop, thereby sharing the native Start Menu of Windows 7 as well as participating in file type associations. It is not distributed with Windows 7 media, but is offered as a free download to users of the Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate editions from Microsoft's web site. Users of Home Premium who want Windows XP functionality on their systems can download Windows Virtual PC free of charge, but must provide their own licensed copy of Windows XP. XP Mode is intended for consumers rather than enterprises, as it offers no central management capabilities. Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (Med-V) is available for the enterprise market. * Native support for Hyper-V virtual machines through the inclusion of VMBus integration drivers. * The memory manager is optimized to mitigate the problem of total memory consumption in the event of excessive cached read operations, which occurred on earlier releases of 64-bit Windows. * AVCHD camera support and Universal Video Class 1.1 * Protected Broadcast Driver Architecture (PBDA) for TV tuner cards, first implemented in Windows Media Center TV Pack 2008 for Windows Vista. * Support for up to 256 logical processorsWindows 7 details galore: interface tweaks, netbook builds, Media Center enhancements * Fewer hardware locks and greater parallelism * Timer coalescing: modern processors and chipsets can switch to very low power usage levels while the CPU is idle. In order to reduce the number of times the CPU enters and exits idle states, Windows 7 introduces the concept of \\"timer coalescing\\"; multiple applications or device drivers which perform actions on a regular basis can be set to occur at once, instead of each action being performed on their own schedule. This facility is available in both kernel mode, via the \`KeSetCoalesableTimer \` API (which would be used in place of \`KeSetTimerEx\`), and in user mode with the \`SetWaitableTimerEx\` Windows API call (which replaces \`SetWaitableTimer\`). * Multi-function devices and Device Containers: Prior to Windows 7, every device attached to the system was treated as a single functional end-point, known as a devnode, that has a set of capabilities and a \\"status\\". While this is appropriate for single-function devices (such as a keyboard or scanner), it does not accurately represent multi-function devices such as a combined printer, fax machine, and scanner, or web-cams with a built-in microphone. In Windows 7, the drivers and status information for multi-function device can be grouped together as a single \\"Device Container\\", which is presented to the user in the new \\"Devices and Printers\\" Control Panel as a single unit. This capability is provided by a new Plug and Play property, \`ContainerID\`, which is a Globally Unique Identifier that is different for every instance of a physical device. The Container ID can be embedded within the device by the manufacturer, or created by Windows and associated with each devnode when it is first connected to the computer. In order to ensure the uniqueness of the generated Container ID, Windows will attempt to use information unique to the device, such as a MAC address or USB serial number. Devices connected to the computer via USB, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), eSATA, PCI Express, Bluetooth, and Windows Rally's PnP-X support can make use of Device Containers. * User-Mode Scheduling: The 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 introduce a user-mode scheduling framework. On Microsoft Windows operating systems, scheduling of threads inside a process is handled by the kernel. While for most applications this is sufficient, applications with large concurrent threading requirements, such as a database server, can benefit from having a thread scheduler in-process. This is because the kernel no longer needs to be involved in context switches between threads, and it obviates the need for a thread pool mechanism as threads can be created and destroyed much more quickly when no kernel context switches are required. * Windows 7 will also contain a new FireWire (IEEE 1394) stack that fully supports IEEE 1394b with S800, S1600 and S3200 data rates. * The ability to join a domain offline. * Service Control Manager in conjunction with the Windows Task Scheduler supports trigger-start services.Trigger Started Services: Channel9 Video See also * Features new to Windows XP * Features new to Windows Vista * Features new to Windows 8 * Features new to Windows 10 * List of features removed in Windows XP * List of features removed in Windows Vista * List of features removed in Windows 7 * List of features removed in Windows 8 * List of features removed in Windows 10 References External links * What's New in Windows 7 for IT Pros (RC) * Windows 7 Support Category:Windows 7 Windows 7 ","title":"Features new to Windows 7"},{"id":"19990374","text":"Jajce II Hydroelectric Power Station is a diversion type of hydroelectric power plant on the Vrbas river, whose and powerhouse (generation hall, generating station or generating plant) is situated underground 17 km downstream from town of Jajce, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Conserving Carolina was created in July 2017, from a merger of two previously-separate organizations, Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy and Pacolet Area Conservancy. The combined organization maintains a primary office in Hendersonville, NC and a regional office in Columbus, NC. History What was to become the Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy, now Conserving Carolina, began with a 1991 natural areas inventory of Henderson County, NC, which identified numerous places in the County with intact and important natural resources worthy of conservation. In 1994, the Natural Heritage Trust of Henderson County was formed to seek protection of these important sites. A year later, it was renamed the Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy and expanded its area of focus to include Transylvania and parts of Buncombe, Rutherford, Polk and Jackson Counties.History of CMLC The organization began working with local landowners to protect farm, forest, park, and natural lands with the support of local community members.Private Land Owner's Network Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy grew to be one of the premier land conservancies in the Southeast, protecting some of land, and became a fully accredited land trust under the Land Trust Accreditation Commission.Land Trust Alliance Press Release on CMLC The Pacolet Area Conservancy was formed in 1989 to conserve land and water resources in Polk County, North Carolina and parts of the Pacolet River watershed across the state line in the Landrum area of South Carolina. Prior to the merger in 2017, Pacolet Area Conservancy helped protect more than 10,000 acres of forests, farms, greenspace, mountains, and waterways, including 1,500 acres at the Walnut Creek Preserve in northern Polk County. After over a year of discussions focused on greater collaboration between the organizations, the two conservancies decide to join in order to more effectively advance their common mission to conserve natural resources in their burgeoning region within the Carolinas for generations to come. With an expanded geographic region, the merged organization combines expertise, talents, resources and a strengthened ability to protect land and water resources, and foster appreciation of the region's unique natural heritage. Approach Conserving Carolina works with various sectors of society including businesses, individuals, communities, partner organizations, and government agencies to achieve its goals. Conserving Carolina uses a mix of financial incentives along with the goodwill of conservation-minded landowners to preserve land from development. Conserving Carolina has pioneered the use of conservation easements in Henderson and Transylvania Counties. A conservation easement is a way for landowners to ensure that their land remains in its natural state while capitalizing on some of the land's potential development value. Conserving Carolina also works with the North Carolina Division of State Parks and other government partners to acquire land for sites such as Chimney Rock State Park. Significant Conservation =Chimney Rock State Park= The Worlds Edge Property was a 2005, $16 million joint effort between the Conserving Carolina, along with The Nature Conservancy to save some of a non-contiguous property spanning across Henderson, Polk, and Rutherford counties. The Worlds Edge Property, formerly owned by The Robert Haywood Morrison Foundation, contains over of streams and waterfalls, in addition to numerous endangered salamander, bird, and bat species. In December 2009, Conserving Carolina acquired the Weed Patch Mountain tract north of Lake Lure, which adds to the corridor of conserved land including the State Park. =Green River Preserve= The Green River Preserve encompasses some of the upper Green River Watershed, the largest conservation project in terms of acreage by Conserving Carolina. The Green River area is listed under the North Carolina Natural Heritage identified natural area, significant for a diversity of habitat types including granite dome outcrops, steep cliffs, rich cove forests, Carolina hemlock bluffs, and pine-oak forests. The conservation of this area was made possible by donations from the Schenck and Ball families, with help from the Clean Water Management Trust Fund. =Florence Nature Preserve= The Florence Nature Preserve is a 600-acre (2.4 km2) tract located in the upper Hickory Nut Gorge area near Gerton, North Carolina. Donated by Dr. Tom and Glenna Florence in two phases (1996 and 2001) the preserve is open to the general public for hiking.Article on Dr. Tom and Glenna Florence from the Times-News =Lewis Creek Nature Preserve= Lewis Creek Nature Preserve is located in Edneyville, North Carolina. The preserve is home to a mixed Appalachian Bog. This ecosystem is listed as critically endangered with only of this variety of bogs and fens still in existence, an 83 percent loss from the estimated that once existed.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Strategic Plan Appendix A Conserving Carolina purchased the property that forms Lewis Creek Nature Park in 2004 to be maintained for the use of homeowners in the adjacent neighborhood.Lewis Creek article from the Hendersonville Times-News The North Carolina Ecosystem Enhancement Program has been contracted to conduct stream restoration on the portion of Lewis Creek running through the nature park. The finish date of this project has been delayed from the original estimation of August 2008. Due to the fragile and unique nature of the park, it is not open to the general public, but Conserving Carolina does hold tree planting and exotic invasive species removal workdays there. =Headwaters State Forest= In June 2010, CMLC, in partnership with The Conservation Fund, announced that in the upper French Broad River watershed in Transylvania County, North Carolina was under contract for purchase with Champion Cattle and Tree Farms, a company owned by the family of former western North Carolina Congressman Charles H. Taylor. The tract lies on the South Carolina state line across from the City of Greenville's Table Rock Watershed property. It includes an eight-mile (13 km) section of the Foothills Trail and is home to over of headwaters trout streams. Volunteerism Like many non-profits, Conserving Carolina relies on the contribution of volunteers who constitute the board of directors, and participate in the day-to-day operations of the organization. In 2007, volunteers contributed over 3,600 hours, saving the organization an estimated $70,236.00 (U.S) worth of staff time.CMLC Volunteer Page Volunteer positions include office administrators, wildlife monitors, committee members, and tech support consultants.

While some Sleep Station albums have been recorded with a full band (After the War, The Pride of Chester James), others have essentially been David Debiak solo albums (Von Cosel, The Blood of Our Our Fathers), featuring very little, if any, instrumentation other than David Debiak's own guitar playing. Sleep Station is known for its concept albums; to date, all Sleep Station releases have been concept albums, and have been called \\"rock operas\\" by some critics. David Debiak himself, however, has stated that he is not trying to tell a story in his songs, stating in a MySpace bulletin \\"Every record I have done as Sleep Station has been thematic in its nature, not trying to tell a story but just create a mood.\\" Unconventional love affairs and war are common lyrical themes in Sleep Station's music. History Sleep Station began in 2001, with David Debiak having the intention of producing a movie. Unable to obtain funds to do so, he opted to write a soundtrack to the nonexistent movie instead. The result was the concept album Anhedonia, released on Spot The Genius Productions in 2001, which chronicles the life, death and subsequent trip to hell, of a serial killer and rapist. Following Anhedonia, Sleep Station signed to New Jersey-based Eyeball Records. In 2002, Sleep Station released its first album on Eyeball Records, Runaway Elba-1. The album tells the story of a cybernetics engineer who builds a female robot, Elba-1. Elba-1 and the engineer fall wildly in love, but must flee when the engineer's employers are determined to steal Elba-1. The following year, Sleep Station released the Von Cosel EP as a free download on the band's website. Although previous Sleep Station albums had featured several David Debiak acoustic solo songs, Von Cosel was the first release to slightly abandon the \\"band\\" format. There were, however, substantial contributions by Brad Paxton (Guitar), and Ryan Ball (Guitar, Bass, Lap Steel, Drums, Piano, Organ, Recording, Mixing, and Mastering engineer). For their next album, Hang in There Charlie, Sleep Station once again adopted a \\"band\\" format. Hang in There Charlie tells the story of two astronauts who arrive at a space station to discover it has been hugely neglected. When the astronauts protest, they are punished by NASA by being abandoned and left in the space station to die. In 2004, Sleep Station released its arguably most successful album to date, After The War. Recorded using mostly instruments and equipment from the 1940s, After The War tells the story of a soldier fighting in World War II, while occasionally interspersing stories from other characters. The album features interludes of 1940s audio recordings of soldiers reciting poetry for their wives and girlfriends. Following After the War, Sleep Station went on hiatus, with David Debiak starting a side project, New London Fire, with his brother Jason. In 2008, Sleep Station returned from hiatus with the album The Pride of Chester James, an album about a fictional circus drifter who shows up in a small town. Later in the year, Sleep Station released The Blood of Our Fathers as a free download on the Air and Sea Battle website, an album whose lyrics loosely revolve around two brothers fighting in an unnamed war.

If built, the 57 m high concrete gravity dam will be one of the largest hydropower plants in the country, with an installed electric capacity of 93 MW and an expected annual generation of 322 GWh.  Location  The dam and its associated power station will be built on the upper course of the Drina river, in the municipality of Foƒça, about 12 km upstream the town of the same name, in Republika Srpska. The site is just 10 km from the border with Montenegro, and 21 km downstream the existing 360 MW Mratinje dam, built on a headwater of the Drina.  Description  Buk Bijela HPP is part of a broader plan to use the hydropower potential of the Drina river and its tributary Sutjeska river, the Upper Drina hydropower project, that also includes three smaller plants (44 MW Foƒça, 43 MW Paunci, and 44 MW Sutjeska), for a total capacity of 224 MW, annual power generation of 871 GWh and an overall cost of ‚Ç¨390 million. The project is being developed by Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske (ERS), to which the Republika Srpska government has granted a 50 year concession. As of 2018, the estimated cost of the project was close to ‚Ç¨200 million. Construction could last 5 or 6 years.  Timeline  A first project for the site was presented in 1974, in order to address the persistent electric shortfall in fastly-growing Yugoslavia. In 1975, the public electric utility company Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine submitted a $70 million loan demand to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to help finance the $242.5 million project. It should be emphasized that the Buk Bijela hydropower project was at that time much larger than the current one, with an installed capacity of 450 MW. In May 2019, Banja Luka District Court cancelled the environmental permit for Buk Bijela HPP, ruling on a complaint filed by CEE Bankwatch Network. Despite this decision, Republic Srpska's Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic stated in January 2020 that the official start of preparatory works would soon be announced. Project implementation could be accelerated thanks to a cooperation with Serbia, which committed in July 2019 to invest ‚Ç¨153.5 million in several hydropower projects including Buj Bijela.  Environmental concerns  The project has been under harsh scrutiny of local and national communities and various NGO's from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and abroad, due which is postponed and could eventually be abandoned. This project was a matter of inter-state agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. It would certainly destroy one of the last remaining and most important habitats of Danube salmon (Hucho hucho) in the world, along with the magnificent canyon of the Tara river, which is why this project encountered major opposition in both countries.

He has subsequently become known for anti-vaccination activism. Publicity around the 1998 study caused a sharp decline in vaccination uptake, leading to a number of outbreaks of measles around the world. He was a surgeon on the liver transplant programme at the Royal Free Hospital in London and became senior lecturer and honorary consultant in experimental gastroenterology at the Royal Free and University College School of Medicine. He resigned from his positions there in 2001, \\"by mutual agreement\\", then moved to the United States. In 2004, Wakefield began working at the Thoughtful House research center in Austin, Texas, serving as Executive Director there until February 2010, when he resigned in the wake of findings against him by the British General Medical Council. Wakefield published his 1998 paper on autism in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, claiming a novel form of enterocolitis linked to autism. However, other researchers were unable to reproduce his findings, and a 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part. Most of Wakefield's co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations, and the British General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues, focusing on Deer's findings. In 2010, the GMC found that Wakefield had been dishonest in his research, had acted against his patients' best interests and mistreated developmentally delayed children, and had \\"failed in his duties as a responsible consultant\\". The Lancet fully retracted Wakefield's 1998 publication on the basis of the GMC's findings, noting that elements of the manuscript had been falsified and that the journal had been \\"deceived\\" by Wakefield. Three months later, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, due in part to his deliberate falsification of research published in The Lancet, and was barred from practising medicine in the UK. In a related legal decision, a British court held that \\"[t]here is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [Dr. Wakefield's] hypothesis, that MMR vaccine and autism/enterocolitis are causally linked\\". Wakefield has continued to defend his research and conclusions, saying there was no fraud, hoax or profit motive.Ziv S.

After leaving the independent King Edward's School, Bath, Wakefield studied medicine at St Mary's Hospital Medical School (now Imperial College School of Medicine), fully qualifying in 1981. Wakefield became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1985.  Career  At the University of Toronto from 1986 to 1989, he was a member of a team that studied tissue rejection problems with small intestine transplantation, using animal models. He continued his studies of small intestine transplantation under a Wellcome Trust travelling fellowship at University of Toronto in Canada. = Claims of measles virus‚ÄìCrohn's disease link = Back in the UK, he worked on the liver transplant programme at the Royal Free Hospital in London. In 1993, Wakefield attracted professional attention when he published reports in which he concluded that measles virus might cause Crohn's disease; and two years later he published a paper in The Lancet proposing a link between the measles vaccine and Crohn's disease. Subsequent research failed to confirm this hypothesis, with a group of experts in Britain reviewing a number of peer- reviewed studies in 1998 and concluding that the measles virus did not cause Crohn's disease, and neither did the MMR vaccine. Later, in 1995, while conducting research into Crohn's disease, he was approached by Rosemary Kessick, the parent of a child with autism, who was seeking help with her son's bowel problems and autism; Kessick ran a group called Allergy Induced Autism. In 1996, Wakefield turned his attention to researching possible connections between the MMR vaccine and autism. At the time of his MMR research study, Wakefield was senior lecturer and honorary consultant in experimental gastroenterology at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine (from 2008, UCL Medical School). He resigned in 2001, by \\"mutual agreement and was made a fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists\\", and moved to the US in 2001 (or 2004, by another account). He was reportedly asked to leave the Royal Free Hospital after refusing a request to validate his 1998 Lancet paper with a controlled study. Wakefield subsequently helped establish and served as the executive director of Thoughtful House Center for Children, which studies autism in Austin, Texas, where, according to The Times, he \\"continued to promote the theory of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, despite admitting it was 'not proved'.\\" He resigned from Thoughtful House in February 2010, after the British General Medical Council found that he had been \\"dishonest and irresponsible\\" in conducting his earlier autism research in England. The Times reported in May 2010 that he was a medical advisor for Visceral, a UK charity that \\"researches bowel disease and developmental disorders\\". Wakefield is barred from practising as a physician in the UK, and is not licensed in the US. He lives in the US where he has a following, including the anti-vaccinationist Jenny McCarthy, who wrote the foreword for Wakefield's autobiography, Callous Disregard. She has a son with autism-like symptoms that she believes were caused by the MMR vaccine.Lawry, R. (10 March 2014). Jenny McCarthy‚Äôs dangerous anti-vaccine crusade. New York Post archive. Retrieved 28 April 2015. According to Brian Deer, , Wakefield lives near Austin with his family. Wakefield has set up the non-profit Strategic Autism Initiative to commission studies into the condition, and is currently listed as a director of a company called Medical Interventions for Autism and another called the Autism Media Channel.  The Lancet fraud On 28 February 1998, Wakefield was the lead author of a study of twelve children with autism that was published in The Lancet. The study proposed a new syndrome called autistic enterocolitis, and raised the possibility of a link between a novel form of bowel disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine. The authors said that the parents of eight of the twelve children linked what were described as \\"behavioural symptoms\\" with MMR, and reported that the onset of these symptoms began within two weeks of MMR vaccination. These possible triggers were reported as MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's Medical Research Council the following month. One 2005 study in Japan found that there was no causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism in groups of children given the triple MMR vaccine and children who received individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations. In Japan, the MMR vaccine had been replaced with individual vaccinations in 1993. Although the paper said that no causal connection had been proven, before it was published, Wakefield made statements at a press conference and in a video news release issued by the hospital, calling for suspension of the triple MMR vaccine until more research could be done. This was later criticized as 'science by press conference'. According to BBC News, it was this press conference, rather than the paper in The Lancet, that fuelled the MMR vaccination scare. The BBC report said he told journalists: \\"it was a 'moral issue' and he could no longer support the continued use of the three-in-one jab for measles, mumps and rubella. 'Urgent further research is needed to determine whether MMR may give rise to this complication in a small number of people,' Wakefield said at the time.\\" He said, \\"If you give three viruses together, three live viruses, then you potentially increase the risk of an adverse event occurring, particularly when one of those viruses influences the immune system in the way that measles does.\\" He suggested parents should opt for single vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella, separated by gaps of one year. 60 Minutes interviewed him in November 2000, and he repeated these claims to the U.S. audience, providing a new focus for the nascent anti- vaccination movement in the U.S., which had been primarily concerned about thiomersal in vaccines. In December 2001, Wakefield resigned from the Royal Free Hospital, saying, \\"I have been asked to go because my research results are unpopular.\\" The medical school said that he had left \\"by mutual agreement\\". In February 2002, Wakefield stated: \\"What precipitated this crisis was the removal of the single vaccine, the removal of choice, and that is what has caused the furore‚Äîbecause the doctors, the gurus, are treating the public as though they are some kind of moronic mass who cannot make an informed decision for themselves.\\" = Aftermath of initial controversy = Wakefield continued to conduct clinical research in the United States after leaving the Royal Free Hospital in December 2001. He joined a controversial American researcher, Jeff Bradstreet, at the International Child Development Resource Center, to conduct further studies on the possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. In 2004, Wakefield began working at the Thoughtful House research center in Austin, Texas. Wakefield served as Executive Director of Thoughtful House until February 2010, when he resigned in the wake of findings against him by the British General Medical Council. In February 2004, the controversy resurfaced when Wakefield was accused of a conflict of interest. In The Sunday Times, Brian Deer reported that some of the parents of the 12 children in the study in The Lancet were recruited via a UK lawyer preparing a lawsuit against MMR manufacturers, and that the Royal Free Hospital had received ¬£55,000 from the UK's Legal Aid Board (now the Legal Services Commission) to pay for the research. Previously, in October 2003, the board had cut off public funding for the litigation against MMR manufacturers. Following an investigation of the allegations in The Sunday Times by the UK General Medical Council, Wakefield was charged with serious professional misconduct, including dishonesty. In December 2006, Deer, writing in The Sunday Times, further reported that in addition to the money they donated to the Royal Free Hospital, the lawyers responsible for the MMR lawsuit had paid Wakefield personally more than ¬£400,000, which he had not previously disclosed. Twenty-four hours before the 2004 Sunday Times report by Deer, The Lancets editor Richard Horton responded to the investigation in a public statement, describing Wakefield's research as \\"fatally flawed\\" and said he believed the paper would have been rejected as biased if the peer reviewers had been aware of Wakefield's conflict of interest. Ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors of the paper in The Lancet later published a retraction of an interpretation. The section of the paper retracted read as follows: The retraction stated: = Wakefield v Channel 4 and others = In November 2004, Channel 4 broadcast a one-hour Dispatches investigation by reporter Brian Deer; the Toronto Star said Deer had \\"produced documentary evidence that Wakefield applied for a patent on a single-jab measles vaccine before his campaign against the MMR vaccine, raising questions about his motives\\". In addition to Wakefield's unpublished initial patent submission, Deer released a copy of the published patent application. At page 1, the first paragraph of this stated: Before describing the research in Wakefield's 1998 paper in The Lancet, at the same page this patent explicitly states that the use of the MMR vaccine causes autism: According to Deer, a letter from Wakefield's lawyers to him dated 31 January 2005 said: \\"Dr Wakefield did not plan a rival vaccine.\\" In the Dispatches programme, Deer also revealed that Nicholas Chadwick, a researcher working under Wakefield's supervision in the Royal Free medical school, had failed to find measles virus in the children reported on in The Lancet. In January 2005, Wakefield initiated libel proceedings against Channel 4, the independent production company Twenty Twenty and Brian Deer, The Sunday Times, and against Deer personally along with his website briandeer.com. Within weeks of issuing his claims, however, Wakefield sought to have the action frozen until after the conclusion of General Medical Council proceedings against him. Channel 4 and Deer sought a High Court order compelling Wakefield to continue with his action, or discontinue it. After a hearing on 27 and 28 October 2005, Mr Justice David Eady ruled against a stay of proceedings: The judgment identified Channel 4's \\"very lengthy extracts\\" summarizing Deer's allegations against Wakefield: :(i) [Wakefield] spread fear that the MMR vaccine might lead to autism, even though he knew that his own laboratory had carried out tests whose results dramatically contradicted his claims in that the measles virus had not been found in a single one of the children concerned in his study and he knew or ought to have known that there was absolutely no basis at all for his belief that the MMR should be broken up into single vaccines. :(ii) In spreading such fear, acted dishonestly and for mercenary motives in that, although he improperly failed to disclose the fact, he planned a rival vaccine and products (such as a diagnostic kit based on his theory) that could have made his fortune :(iii) Gravely abused the children under his care by unethically carrying out extensive invasive procedures (on occasions requiring three people to hold a child down), thereby driving nurses to leave and causing his medical colleagues serious concern and unhappiness :(iv) Improperly and/or dishonestly failed to disclose to his colleagues and to the public that his research on autistic children had begun with a contract with solicitors who were trying to sue the manufacturers of the MMR vaccine :(v) Improperly or dishonestly lent his reputation to the International Child Development Resource Centre, which promoted to very vulnerable parents expensive products for whose efficacy (as he knew or should have known) there was no scientific evidence Mr. Justice Eady's ruling states that, \\"The views or conclusions of the GMC disciplinary body would not, so far as I can tell, be relevant or admissible\\", that Channel 4's allegations \\"go to undermine fundamentally the Claimant's professional integrity and honesty\\", and that, \\"It cannot seriously be suggested that priority should be given to GMC proceedings for the resolution of issues.\\" In December 2006, Deer released records obtained from the Legal Services Commission, showing that it had paid ¬£435,643 in undisclosed fees to Wakefield for the purpose of building a case against the MMR vaccine. Those payments, The Sunday Times reported, had begun two years before publication of Wakefield's paper in The Lancet. Within days of Deer's report, Wakefield dropped all his libel actions and was ordered to pay all defendants' legal costs. = Other concerns = Wakefield's data was also questioned; a former graduate student, who appeared in Deer's programme, later testified that Wakefield ignored laboratory data that conflicted with his hypothesis. An independent investigation of a collaborating laboratory questioned the accuracy of the data underpinning Wakefield's claims. In June 2005, the BBC programme Horizon reported on an unnamed and unpublished study of blood samples from a group of 100 autistic children and 200 children without autism. They reported finding 99% of the samples contained no trace of the measles virus, and the samples that did contain the virus were just as likely to be from non-autistic children, i.e., only three samples contained the measles virus, one from an autistic child and two from a typically developing child. The study's authors found no evidence of any link between MMR and autism. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the United States National Academy of Sciences, along with the CDC and the UK National Health Service, have found no link between vaccines and autism. Reviews in the medical literature have also found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism or with bowel disease, which Wakefield called \\"autistic enterocolitis\\".  General Medical Council hearings  Between July 2007 and May 2010, a 217-day \\"fitness to practise\\" hearing of the UK General Medical Council examined charges of professional misconduct against Wakefield and two colleagues involved in the paper in The Lancet. The charges included that he: * \\"Was being paid to conduct the study by solicitors representing parents who believed their children had been harmed by MMR\\". * Ordered investigations \\"without the requisite paediatric qualifications\\" including colonoscopies, colon biopsies and lumbar punctures (\\"spinal taps\\") on his research subjects without the approval of his department's ethics board and contrary to the children's clinical interests, when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children's symptoms or medical history. * \\"Act[ed] 'dishonestly and irresponsibly' in failing to disclose ... how patients were recruited for the study\\" as well as in his descriptions in the Lancet papers and in questions after the paper published, about what ailments the children had, and when those ailments were observed relative to their getting vaccinated. * \\"Conduct[ed] the study on a basis not approved by the hospital's ethics committee.\\" * Purchased blood samples‚Äîfor ¬£5 each‚Äîfrom children present at his son's birthday party, which Wakefield joked about in a later presentation. * \\"[S]howed callous disregard for any distress or pain the children might suffer\\" Wakefield denied the charges; on 28 January 2010, the GMC ruled against Wakefield on all issues, stating that he had \\"failed in his duties as a responsible consultant\\", acted against the interests of his patients, and \\"dishonestly and irresponsibly\\" in his controversial research. On 24 May 2010, he was struck off the United Kingdom medical register. It was the harshest sanction that the GMC could impose, and effectively ended his career as a physician. In announcing the ruling, the GMC said that Wakefield had \\"brought the medical profession into disrepute\\", and no sanction short of erasing his name from the register was appropriate for the \\"serious and wide-ranging findings\\" of misconduct. On the same day, Wakefield's autobiography, Callous Disregard was published, using the same words as one of the charges against him (\\"he showed callous disregard for any distress or pain the children might suffer\\"). Wakefield argued that he had been unfairly treated by the medical and scientific establishment.  Fraud and conflict of interest allegations  In February 2009, The Sunday Times reported that a further investigation by the newspaper had revealed that Wakefield \\"changed and misreported results in his research, creating the appearance of a possible link with autism\\", citing evidence obtained by the newspaper from medical records and interviews with witnesses, and supported by evidence presented to the GMC. In April 2010, Deer expanded on laboratory aspects of his findings in a report in the BMJ, recounting how normal clinical histopathology results (obtained from the Royal Free hospital) had been subjected to wholesale changes, from normal to abnormal, in the medical school and published in The Lancet. On 2 January 2011, Deer provided two tables comparing the data on the twelve children, showing the original hospital data and the data with the wholesale changes as used in the 1998 The Lancet article.\\\\--> \\"MMR & Autism: Fixing a Link\\", Tables prepared by Brian Deer as a supplement to his peer reviewed report \\"How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed\\", published in the BMJ in January 2011 (BMJ 2011;342:c5347). alt source (archive (at anchor #T1)) On 5 January 2011, BMJ published an article by Brian Deer entitled \\"How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed\\". Deer said that, based on examination of the medical records of the 12 children in the original study, his research had found: In an accompanying editorial, BMJ editors said: The British Medical Journal editorial concluded that Wakefield's paper was an \\"elaborate fraud\\". In a BMJ follow-up article on 11 January 2011, Deer stated that Wakefield had planned to capitalize on the MMR vaccination scare provoked by his paper. He said that based upon documents he had obtained under Freedom of information legislation, Wakefield‚Äîin partnership with the father of one of the boys in the study‚Äîhad planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and \\"litigation driven testing\\". The Washington Post reported that Deer said that Wakefield predicted he \\"could make more than $43 million a year from diagnostic kits\\" for the new condition, autistic enterocolitis. According to Deer's report in BMJ, the ventures, Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Ltd and Carmel Healthcare Ltd‚Äînamed after Wakefield's wife‚Äîfailed after Wakefield's superiors at University College London's medical school gave him a two-page letter that said: > We remain concerned about a possible serious conflict of interest between > your academic employment by UCL, and your involvement with Carmel ... This > concern arose originally because the company's business plan appears to > depend on premature, scientifically unjustified publication of results, > which do not conform to the rigorous academic and scientific standards that > are generally expected. WebMD reported on Deer's BMJ report, saying that the $43 million predicted yearly profits would come from marketing kits for \\"diagnosing patients with autism\\" and that \\"the initial market for the diagnostic will be litigation- driven testing of patients with AE [autistic enterocolitis, an unproven condition concocted by Wakefield] from both the UK and the US\\". According to WebMD, the BMJ article also claimed that Carmel Healthcare Ltd would succeed in marketing products and developing a replacement vaccine if \\"public confidence in the MMR vaccine was damaged\\". In October 2012, research published in PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identified Wakefield's 1998 paper as the most cited retracted scientific paper, with 758 citations, and gave the \\"reason for retraction\\" as \\"fraud\\". = Journal retractions = On 2 February 2010, The Lancet formally retracted Wakefield's 1998 paper. The retraction states: \\"The claims in the original paper that children were 'consecutively referred' and that investigations were 'approved' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false.\\" The following day, the editor of a specialist journal, Neurotoxicology, withdrew another Wakefield paper that was in press. The article, which concerned research on monkeys, had already been published online and sought to implicate vaccines in autism. In May 2010, The American Journal of Gastroenterology retracted a paper of Wakefield's that used data from the 12 patients of the article in The Lancet. On 5 January 2011, British Medical Journal editors recommended that Wakefield's other publications should be scrutinized and retracted if need be. = Wakefield response = As of January 2011, Wakefield continued to maintain his innocence. In a press release, he stated, In an Internet radio interview, Wakefield said the BMJ series \\"was utter nonsense\\" and denied \\"that he used the cases of the 12 children in his study to promote his business venture\\". Deer has filed financial disclosure forms and rejects Wakefield's claim that he is funded by the pharmaceutical industry. According to CNN, Wakefield said the patent he held was for \\"an 'over-the-counter nutritional supplement' that boosts the immune system\\". WebMD reported that Wakefield said he was the victim of \\"a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns\\". Wakefield says that Deer is a \\"hit man who was brought in to take [him] down\\" and that other scientists have simply taken Deer at his word. While on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞, he said that he had not read the BMJ articles yet, but he denied their validity and denied that Deer had interviewed the families of the children in the study. He also urged viewers to read his book, Callous Disregard, which he said would explain why he was being targeted, to which Anderson Cooper replied: \\"But sir, if you're lying, then your book is also a lie. If your study is a lie, your book is a lie.\\" Wakefield later implied that there is a conspiracy by public health officials and pharmaceutical companies to discredit him, including suggesting they pay bloggers to post rumours about him on websites or that they artificially inflated reports of deaths from measles. = Deer counter-response = Deer responded to Wakefield's charge by challenging Wakefield to sue him: Deer mentioned that all of Wakefield's previous libel actions had been dismissed or withdrawn. In January 2012, Wakefield filed a defamation lawsuit in Texas state court against Deer, Fiona Godlee, and the BMJ for false accusations of fraud, seeking a jury trial in Travis County. The filing identified Wakefield as a resident of Austin, and cited the \\"Texas Long-Arm Statute\\" as justification for initiating the proceeding in Texas. The BMJ responded that it stood by its reports and would \\"defend the claim vigorously\\". In August 2012 District Court Judge Amy Meachum dismissed Wakefield's suit for lack of jurisdiction. Her ruling was upheld on appeal in September 2014 and Wakefield was ordered to pay all parties' costs. On 5 April 2011, Deer was named the UK's specialist journalist of the year in the British Press Awards, organised by the Society of Editors. The judges said that Deer's investigation of Wakefield was a \\"tremendous righting of a wrong\\".  Epidemics, effects, and reception  Physicians, medical journals, and editors have made statements tying Wakefield's fraudulent actions to various epidemics and deaths. Michael J. Smith, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Louisville, an \\"infectious diseases expert who has studied the autism controversy's effect on immunization rates\\", said, \\"Clearly, the results of this [Wakefield] study have had repercussions.\\" Wakefield's study and his claim that the MMR vaccine might cause autism led to a decline in vaccination rates in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and a corresponding rise in measles and mumps infections, resulting in serious illness and deaths. His continued claims that the vaccine is harmful have contributed to a climate of distrust of all vaccines and the reemergence of other previously-controlled diseases. The Associated Press said: ABC News Channel WWAY3 said: Paul H√©bert, editor-in-chief of the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) said: A profile in a New York Times Magazine article commented: > Andrew Wakefield has become one of the most reviled doctors of his > generation, blamed directly and indirectly, depending on the accuser, for > irresponsibly starting a panic with tragic repercussions: vaccination rates > so low that childhood diseases once all but eradicated here‚Äîwhooping cough > and measles, among them‚Äîhave re-emerged, endangering young lives. Journalist Brian Deer called for criminal charges against Wakefield. On 1 April 2011, the James Randi Educational Foundation awarded Wakefield the Pigasus Award for \\"refusal to face reality\\". A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as \\"the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\\". In 2011, Wakefield was at the top of the list of the worst doctors of 2011 in Medscape's list of \\"Physicians of the Year: Best and Worst\\".\\"Physicians of the Year: Best and Worst\\". Medscape 2011 In January 2012, Time magazine named Wakefield in a list of \\"Great Science Frauds\\".\\"Great Science Frauds\\". Time Magazine, 13 January 2012 In 2012 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement in Quackery award by the Good Thinking Society. A writer from The New York Times, who was covering a 2011 event in Tomball, Texas where Wakefield spoke, was threatened by its organizer, Michelle Guppy: \\"Be nice to him, or we will hurt you.\\" Guppy is the coordinator of the Houston Autism Disability Network. In June 2012, a local court in Rimini, Italy, ruled that the MMR vaccination had caused autism in a 15-month-old boy. The court relied heavily on Wakefield's discredited Lancet paper and largely ignored the scientific evidence presented to it. The decision was appealed. On 13 February 2015, the decision was overturned by a Court of Appeals in Bologna. In February 2015, Wakefield denied that he bore any responsibility for the measles epidemic that started at Disneyland. He also reaffirmed his discredited belief that \\"MMR contributes to the current autism epidemic\\". By that time at least 166 measles cases had been reported. Paul Offit did not agree, saying that the outbreak was \\"directly related to Dr. Wakefield's theory\\". Filmmaker Miranda Bailey followed Wakefield and his wife Carmel and their children for five years filming a documentary about Wakefield as a person, The Pathological Optimist. According to Robert Ladendorf writing for Skeptical Inquirer magazine, Bailey attempted to remain neutral and add a \\"human touch\\", which Ladendorf says was successful. Wakefield is shown \\"as a soft-spoken but beleaguered family man trying to resurrect his reputation and raising money for his legal fund.\\" In 2018, The Skeptic awarded Wakefield the Rusty Razor award \\"for pseudoscience and bad critical thinking.\\" The award is decided annually by readers‚Äô votes. Editor Deborah Hyde said, \\"Our contributors clearly felt that anti-vaccination damage is still a current issue, despite Mr. Wakefield first having come to public attention so long ago. These childhood diseases can do real damage, so we‚Äôre proud to be an organisation that gets the good news out there ‚Äì the evidence is overwhelming that vaccination is safe. Protect your children and your community by using it.\\"  Political activism  Wakefield was scheduled to testify before the Oregon Senate Health Care Committee on 9 March 2015, in opposition to Senate Bill 442, \\"a bill that would eliminate nonmedical exemptions from Oregon's school immunization law\\". The Oregon Chiropractic Association had invited him. The chairman of the committee then canceled the meeting \\"after it became clear that\\" Wakefield planned to testify. She denied that her decision had anything to do with Wakefield's plans. On 24 April 2015, Wakefield received two standing ovations from the students at Life Chiropractic College West when he told them to oppose Senate Bill SB277, a bill that proposes elimination of non-medical vaccine exemptions. Wakefield had previously been a featured speaker at a 2014 \\"California Jam\\" gathering of chiropractors, as well as a 2015 \\"California Jam\\" seminar, with continuing education credits, sponsored by Life Chiropractic College West. On 3 July 2015, Wakefield participated in a protest held in Santa Monica, California, against SB 277, a recently enacted bill which removed the personal belief exemption to school vaccine requirements in California state law. Vaxxed film In 2016, Wakefield directed the anti-vaccination propaganda film Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe. The film purports to show \\"an appalling cover-up committed by the government agency charged with protecting the health of American citizens [the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)] ... an alarming deception that has contributed to the skyrocketing increase of autism and potentially the most catastrophic epidemic of our lifetime.\\" The film was withdrawn from New York's 2016 Tribeca Film Festival after the festival's founder Robert De Niro (who has a child with autism) reversed his decision to include it. Wakefield called this action censorship. Ian Lipkin, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, writing in The Wall Street Journal, said: \\"If Vaxxed had been submitted as science fiction, it would merit attention for its story line, character development and dialogue. But as a documentary it misrepresents what science knows about autism, undermines public confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and attacks the integrity of legitimate scientists and public-health officials\\".

The structure looked like an antique temple rather than a shopping center. The rightmost stall near the Soborniy (Red) Pereulok was rented by Anton Chekhov‚Äôs father in 1874‚Äì1876. His uncle Ivan Loboda also had a shop there. Since some of the stalls were empty, the trade activities were concentrated in the right part of the rows, the rest was sold for lodging (the left side of Chekhov street, No 107‚Äì119). In 1911 the integrity of the right gallery was damaged by the construction of the two-storey building housing a leather goods shop (Chekhov street, 98). In 1921 just over the former Pavel Chekhov‚Äôs stall, the sculpture group was installed; it symbolized the union of workers and peasants (sculpted by Navratil from Czechoslovakia). In the course of repair work in 1966, it was removed from the edifice. In 1935 for the 75th birth anniversary of Anton Chekhov the territory was transformed into a public square. During the WWII the structure was damaged by a bomb; many apertures were bricked. The intact quarters are still in use. In 1960, for the 100th birth anniversary, the Chekhov Monument in Taganrog was inaugurated right in the Red Square facing the Chekhov Street and the historical downtown Taganrog. The restoration work of the part of the former Alexandrovskiye Trade Rows was completed in 2007.

The rink was one of the earliest indoor ice rinks made of mechanically frozen ice in North America, (others including the North Avenue Ice Palace in Baltimore, Maryland and the Ice Palace in New York, both opened in 1894), enabling a longer season for skating sports. It was demolished in the 1980s. As a rink, it was used for pleasure skating, and the sports of ice hockey and skating. It was an important rink in the development of both sports in the United States. As a boxing arena, it was one of the first legal venues for boxing and remained a busy venue until its closing, although as the popularity of boxing grew, the sport outgrew the capacity of the arena to hold title fights. The arena hosted live boxing on television. History St. Nicholas Rink opened November 7, 1896, at 69 West 66th Street, on the northeast corner of 66th Street and Columbus Avenue. The builders included Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor. Flagg and Chambers were the architects. Before the construction of the building, the St. Nicholas Skating Club had been using an outdoor flooded lot. The ice rink used a mechanically frozen ice or \\"artificial ice\\" surface using techniques developed at the Glaciarium in London, England. A basement ice-making factory shared the ice-making equipment. Another New York skating venue, the Ice Palace, opened shortly before the St. Nicholas Arena. A third artificial ice rink, the Clermont Avenue Rink in Brooklyn opened in 1896, to provide three artificial ice rinks in New York City. The arena was used exclusively for ice sports until 1906, when boxing was introduced. In 1911, prize fight boxing was legalized and prize fights became a popular event at the arena. By 1920, the use of the arena for boxing made the ice rink dispensable and it was removed. The building continued as a boxing venue until 1962.\\"Saint Nicholas Arena\\", boxrec.com\\"OLD BOXING CENTER ON WEST SIDE SOLD; St. Nicholas Arena Bought by Webb & Knapp; May Be Used for TV Sports Spectacles\\", The New York Times, January 9, 1952 The building itself was used as a television production center for the ABC Network and local station WABC-TV where Eyewitness News was broadcast. The building was demolished in the 1980s and the site converted to main offices of ABC Network. During the World War II era, the building was briefly named Royal Windsor Palace. Ice hockey A group of ice hockey players on the St. Nicholas Rink. The rink was the home of the St. Nicholas Hockey Club of the American Amateur Hockey League. The league operated its first season in 1896‚Äì97. The rink was also the site of numerous exhibitions of Canadian ice hockey teams both against New York area teams and between the Canadian teams. A challenge between amateur teams of the U.S. and Canada was held there, called the \\"International Amateur Championship\\". On February 26, 1900, the rink was the site of the first ice hockey game between Harvard University and Yale University, won by Yale 5‚Äì4. The arena was the site of the first game between women's ice hockey teams in the United States. In 1917, the St. Nicholas team defeated Boston 1‚Äì0. The St. Nicholas men's amateur team eventually moved to Madison Square Garden and played on Sunday afternoons in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. Boxing The Rink was a boxing venue from 1906 until May 28, 1962, the date of the last main event. Upon its demise, it was reported that more than 30,000 fights had been staged here. (Others estimate 10,000, to 15,000, to 20,000.) Accounts in The New York Times report that boxing greats Jack Johnson, Jess Willard, Kid Chocolate and Rocky Graziano fought there; the future heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson fought his first professional match there in 1952. On one of the final fight cards, Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) stopped Billy Daniels by seventh-round TKO on May 19, 1962, nine days before The Rink closed its doors for good.\\"Meet Me at St. Nick's\\", boxing.com The last TV series on the DuMont network was Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena which went off the air August 6, 1956. In a 1960 episode called \\"The Big Tall Wish\\" of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone the venue of a fictional boxing match was a \\"St. Nick's Arena\\". The arena is also a location in the episode \\"A Death of Princes\\" from the American television series Naked City which originally aired on 12 October 1960. Guest stars include Eli Wallach, George Maharis, Peter Falk, and Godfrey Cambridge. Other sports The arena was also formative in the growing sport of figure skating. Championships were held at the rink starting in 1897. The last championship, a \\"North American Championship\\" was held in 1918. St. Nicholas Arena was also a venue for wrestling.

It is the successor to Office 4.3 and is the first 32-bit version of Microsoft Office. While designed specifically for Windows 95, it also works on Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 98. As it is 32-bit, it does not run on Windows 3.x or earlier versions of Windows. It is also not supported on Windows NT 3.1 or Windows NT 3.5, despite these operating systems being 32-bit. Office 95 was succeeded by Office 97 on November 19, 1996. All support for Microsoft Office 95 ended on December 31, 2001, the same day as Windows 95. Features Microsoft Office 95 includes six applications: Word (a word processor), Excel (a spreadsheet), PowerPoint (a presentation program), Access (a database management system), Schedule+ (a time management app) and Binder (a program for binding the work of the mentioned apps together). The CD-ROM version also includes Microsoft Bookshelf. True to its namesake, this suite is designed specifically for Windows 95. Previously, Microsoft had released Office 4.2 for Windows NT for several architectures, which included 32‚Äëbit Word 6.0 for Windows NT and Excel 5.0 for Windows NT, but PowerPoint 4.0 was 16‚Äëbit. With Office for Windows 95, all components in the suite were 32-bit. All the Office 95 programs are OLE 2-enabled, meaning that they allow interoperability between themselves, as well as all other applications that support this data interchange protocol. Binder used this protocol to bind OLE objects together. Office for Windows 95 bears version number 7.0 to match Word's version number. Other components also bear the same version numbers to show that they are contemporaries, although their predecessors were not version 6.0. The previous versions of components were Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0, Schedule+ 1.0 and Access 2.0. Binder was a new app at the time with no predecessor. The Office 95 programs utilize a two-tone gradient in the title bar at the top of the window, gradually turning from black at the left side to dark blue at the right. At the time, this was unique to Office 95, no other program running under Windows 95 or Windows NT utilized gradient title bars. This feature was eventually incorporated into the shell of Windows 98 and later, which would allow customizable gradient colors and extend the feature to include dialog boxes as well. Microsoft Excel contained an easter egg, a hidden Doom‚Äìlike game called Hall of Tortured Souls crediting the application's writers. =Contemporaneous components= Several additional programs were \\"compatible with Microsoft Office 95\\": * Microsoft Project for Windows 95 (Version 4.1a) * Microsoft Publisher for Windows 95 (Version 3.0) * Microsoft FrontPage 1.1 * Office Small Business Pack for Office 95 * Small Business Financial Manager for Excel Other contemporaneous Microsoft products were: * Microsoft Works 4.0 * Microsoft Money 4.0 Editions Computer icons of the components Microsoft Office 95 Pro: From left to right, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Schedule+ and Binder Office 95 was available in two versions.

Application ! Standard Edition ! Professional Edition - ! Word   - ! Excel   - ! PowerPoint   - ! Schedule+   - ! Binder   - ! Access   - ! Bookshelf   } Updates There were no downloadable service packs or service releases for Office for Windows 95. Instead, two updated versions, 7.0a and 7.0b were released to fix bugs in the application (the only difference between 7.0a and 7.0b was a fix for a screen redraw problem in PowerPoint). The updates could be ordered from Microsoft Support. A downloadable update was released in 1999 to address minor year 2000 problems.  Issues  Versions 3.0 and 3.5 of the Microsoft Jet database engine, used by Access for Windows 95 (Access 7.0) and the later released Access 97 respectively, had a critical issue which made these versions of Access unusable on a computer with more than 1 GB of memory. While this problem was fixed for Jet 3.5/Access 97, it was never fixed for Jet 3.0 or Access 95. System requirements Microsoft Office 95 requires a 386DX or higher CPU, and either Windows 95 or Windows NT 3.51. It also requires 8 MB of RAM for typical use. Regarding hard disk space, compact installations require 28 MB, \\"typical\\" installations require 55 MB, and full installations require 88 MB.

Featuring interviews interwoven with archive footage, the series examined how he led the country and what drove him through his political career. Synopsis The series featured contributions from more than 70 people directly linked with Ahern, including family members, schoolfriends and national and international politicians. A central aspect of the programme was a \\"marathon\\" interview with Ahern. This interview was conducted shortly after he resigned as Taoiseach and leader of the Fianna F√°il political party in May 2008. An interview with Tony Blair and contributions from former Cabinet colleagues Charlie McCreevy and Mary O'Rourke were included. His former wife Miriam Ahern and their daughters, Cecelia and Georgina were interviewed. Amongst those declining an interview were Ahern's former partner Celia Larkin. Other Cabinet ministers and junior ministers interviewed included Dermot Ahern, Willie O'Dea, Brian Lenihan, Martin Cullen, Mary Harney, Conor Lenihan and Noel Ahern. Among the other figures interviewed were Des Richardson, Joe Burke, Barry English, David McKenna, Chris Wall, Paddy Duffy and Royston Brady. Ahern's successor as Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, did not contribute to the programme. Brian Lenihan described Ahern in the documentary as \\"a man who is utterly consumed by politics and by the exercise of power and he has devoted much of his life to that exercise\\". Production Producer Steve Carson said: \\"It is a political biography of the Taoiseach while also covering Ireland's political history from 1992, where the Haughey series left off.\\" Bertie was produced by Mint Productions,A company founded by presenter Miriam O'Callaghan and her producer husband Steve Carson. who also produced the 2003 programme, Fine Gael: A Family at War and in 2005 Haughey documentary series. also directed by Carson.

From there the focus switched to the 1997 general election, when a minute increase in Fianna F√°il's share of the vote saw him elected Taoiseach for the first time in a coalition Government with the Progressive Democrats.

The series was accused of being \\"too soft\\" on its subject. Desmond O'Malley thought his screened interview unlike that which actually happened. Some of the interviewees were criticised as viewing their part \\"through the distorting mirror of bitterness or loyalty\\", whilst \\"others bore grudges, others were staking their positions for posterity\\".

It was constructed in 1843 under the direction of Archbishop William Walsh, on land provided by local authorities. Holy Cross Cemetery replaced the first Catholic cemetery in Halifax, the St. Peter's Cemetery located next to St. Mary's Basilica on Spring Garden Road. Since 1843, some 25,000 persons have been buried at Holy Cross, many of Irish descent, including Canada's fourth Prime Minister, Sir John Sparrow Thompson. Our Lady of Sorrows Chapel is said to have been built in one day on Aug. 31, 1843 by 2,000 volunteers, although the foundation and some prefabrication had been done in advance. The chapel's modest design is described as a Nova Scotian expression of Gothic revivalism. The furnishings are sparse and modest but the altar reliefs have received national recognition, and the windows have been described as a nationally significant collection of stained glass. Holy Cross Cemetery served as the primary burial ground for Halifax Catholics until 1896, and although interments continued through the twentieth-century the site had fallen into disrepair by 2005. The Holy Cross Cemetery Trust was established in 2006, and a program of restoration and beautification by volunteers has been in progress since 2008, repairing fences, the chapel, and 1800 of the current 2500 gravemarkers.

It is, in essence, an action made by a company or stance of being, to which consumers feel a sense of value when associating with your brand, while the humanization of your brand generates loyalty and \\"word of mouth\\" virality for the organization. The concept derives from Pierre Bourdieu's social capital theory and relates to increasing one's sense of community, granting access to information and knowledge, helping to form one's identity, and providing status and recognition.  In marketing and management  In their study on social currency, the consulting company Vivaldi Partners defined social currency as the extent to which people share the brand or information about the brand as part of their everyday social lives at work or at home. This sharing helps companies to create unique brand identities and earn permission to interact with consumers or customers. In today's age, building social currency is an important investment companies can make to create value for themselves. Social Currency moves social initiatives and campaigns beyond marketing and communications efforts to impacting and changing entire industries and categories. Consumers and customers will benefit as well as they increasingly participate in social platforms, and use social technologies. Social currency can be divided into six dimensions or levers: It is about creating a sense of community and by that a strong affiliation between customers, consumers and users of a brand. Having social currency increases a brand's engagement with consumers and interaction with customers, and by that adding to the customer conversation around the brand, it grants access to information and knowledge, which is being shared within the customer base. Belonging to a group also helps users of a brand to grow personally by accessing new utility and also developing their own identity in the respective peer group. A strong attachment to a brand will also be a core driver for an active advocacy recommending or even defending the brand. 300px The Social Currency Wheel is an alternative to the traditional brand funnel or customer decision journey. The Social Currency Wheel evaluates the impact of social behaviors of customers on social currency and three outcomes: consideration, purchase, and loyalty. The goal of the Social Currency Wheel is to explain how customers' social processes and behaviors drive each of the conversions. Marketers can engage with customers during these social processes and behaviors, and influence the outcomes. Social currency is information shared which encourages further social encounters. It can be a factor in establishing fans of sports or television programmes. As well as talking about sports, attendance at sports events themselves is a form of social currency. Young men in particular feel the need to learn about sporting current events in order to facilitate social interaction. However, these types of fan can easily move to a new sport, team, or programme in the future if the new one offers more social currency. Women may use jewellery and clothes as part of their social currency, providing a way into communication. Proper social currency tactics includes responding to comments, sharing posts to groups and forums, and strategic posting time and placement.

The theory was discussed in academia in the wake of Goldberg v. Kelly, a 1970 U.S. Supreme Court case, which decided that due process, such as a notice and a fair hearing, were required when dealing with the deprivation of a government benefit (such as a medical license) or an entitlement (such as welfare payments). However, attempts to promote redistributive change through the courts gained no traction, and the result of Goldberg v. Kelly was, thus, limited in scope. One of the goals, in light of Brown v. Board of Education, was to promote equality in school funding, but this was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973), which ruled that there was no inherent right to education in the United States. A discussion among two law professors and Illinois State Senator and law lecturer Barack Obama on the topic of civil rights aired on Chicago Public Radio's Odyssey program in 2001. Obama declared in the discussion that redistributive change needs to come through legislation, not the courts, and lamented that the civil rights movement failed to pursue political means to bring such a change about. As a result of Obama's candidacy in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, the matter became a campaign issue during the final week of the election, fueling a charge made by his opponent, U.S. Senator John McCain, that Obama was a closet socialist.

The OLA was formed \\"...to preserve and protect the rights of property owners.\\" The organization seeks to cause laws and regulations, whether federal, provincial, or municipal, to be written so as to be more respectful of the rights of property owners. The Ontario Landowners Association also promotes the use of letters patent as a tool to aid in the protection of private property rights. History The Ontario Landowners Association was founded in December 2005 by delegates from twelve pre-existing landowners groups representing different rural areas of the province. The groups had already been cooperating closely, and for the most part were modeled on the Lanark Landowners Association, which had been conducting demonstrations and other activities since early 2003. A parallel group, the Renfrew Landowners Association, had existed since 2000 and had started the slogan, \\"This Land is Our Land: Back off Government\\" that would be adopted by the Lanark Landowners and eventually by the OLA.\\"The latest in Landowners stats across the province\\", The Landowner, Vol. 1 No. 2 (March/April 2006, p. 16. But it was the Lanark group that first tried to move beyond purely local issues and to recreate itself in different parts of the province. The Lanark Landowners had grown out of an effort to set up a group to advise Scott Reid, the MP for Lanark, on agricultural issues. An initial meeting in April 2003, with Reid present, was held at the kitchen table of Merle Bowes, a Carleton Place farmer. Randy Hillier, who would go on to serve as the first president of the Lanark Landowners, was also present at the meeting.The Landowner, Vol. 1 No. 2 (March/April 2006, p. 14. Bowes later observed that no matter what farm-related issue was being discussed at the meeting, \\"All the problems pointed back to property rights and that got us going.\\"\\"Rural Revolution: From Lanark Landowners to Ontario Landowners in three years\\", The Landowner, Vol. 1 No. 2 (March/April 2006, p. 14. The Lanark Landowners' first action, in May 2003, was a demonstration to protest a property standards by-law in the town of Mississippi Mills. The next month, the group conducted an illegal out-of-season deer hunt to draw attention to the refusal of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources to permit farmers to cull deer who were eating their crops. Media were invited to the hunt and ministry officials were presented with a choice between three options: arresting the farmers, tolerating an ongoing violation of the law, or loosening the criteria for issuing out-of-season cull licences. Within weeks, the third option had been chosen, and the Landowners had won a high-profile victory. This victory emboldened the group and Hillier rapidly built a high profile in the Ontario media, conducting increasingly large demonstrations in rural Ontario. The highest-profile demonstrations took place on Parliament Hill in Ottawa in April 2004, and in March 2005 in Toronto on front lawn of the Ontario Legislature. Future Prime Minister Stephen Harper attended the Ottawa rally and addressed the crowd, endorsing property rights. Local groups modeled on the Lanark model grew up across Ontario over the next three years. By the time of the first convention of the Ontario Landowners Association in Belleville in February 2006, the combined membership of all the local groups was claimed by The Landowner (a magazine started by the Landowners in early 2006) to be over 8,000. Hillier was elected as the organization's first president. During its first years, the OLA sometimes engaged in acts that were seen by some to be in poor taste. For example, the group sent to Queen's Park a photograph of a bullet-riddled dead deer which had been tagged \\"Leona\\"‚Äîa reference to Leona Dombrowsky, who at the time was agriculture minister in Premier Dalton McGuinty's cabinet. After the creation of the OLA in 2006, acts of civil disobedience mostly ended, and were replaced by attempts to influence the political system by more traditional means. Landowner-endorsed candidates ran for municipal office in many rural municipalities in the 2006 Ontario municipal elections. Hillier and other members of the OLA began to appear as witnesses before parliamentary hearings into issues affecting rural areas.For example, Hillier's appearance as a witness at the hearings of the provincial legislature into Bill 43, the Source Water Protection Act, is covered in The Landowner, Vol. 1 No. 4 (Dec/Jan 2007), p. 24. An appearance of Merle Bowes and two other OLA witnesses at the Senate Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry is covered in The Landowner, Vol. 2 No. 1 (June/July 2007), p. 26. In January 2007, Hillier resigned as president of the OLA to seek the Progressive Conservative nomination in Lanark‚ÄîFrontenac‚ÄîLennox and Addington the upcoming provincial election. Some members of the party suggested that Hillier's activist past made him an unsuitable candidate, and the Toronto Star speculated that the party might disqualify him,Ian Urquhart, \\"Rural activist a potential headache for Tories\\", Toronto Star, 12 February 2007, A13. but in the end Hillier won the nomination and was elected to the legislature, where he currently serves. The presidency was taken over by Jack MacLaren, a farmer from rural Ottawa who had previously been a leader of the de-amalgamation movement calling for the re-establishment of the old Carleton County out of the four rural townships that had been amalgamated into the City of Ottawa in 2001.Patrick Meagher, \\"De-amalgamation man\\", The Landowner, Vol. 1 No. 1 (Jan./Feb. 2006), p. 8. By the summer of 2008, the OLA had expanded to 20 chapters, including one in Toronto,The Landowner, Vol. 3 No. 2 (Aug./Sept. 2008), p. 27. and had become a large enough movement to attract the attention of the Governor General's Leadership Group, which arranged a meeting with the OLA in June.\\"The Governor General‚Äôs Leadership Group Meets the Ontario Landowners\\", The Landowner, Vol. 3 No. 2 (Aug./Sept. 2008), p. 12. At the provincial level, it has been noted that Hillier had City Ottawa off on our own Ontarian Alternative supported the Reform Party of Ontario prior to the party's merger with the Family Coalition Party of Ontario to create the New Reform Party of Ontario.,\\"Rural group joins forces with Reform\\", Ottawa Citizen, 18 March 2008. \\"Harness had worked out a side deal under which he would become the deputy under Hillier, if Hillier joined Reform Ontario.[14] Hillier declined and then quickly denied any involvement with the side deal, and the strength of both organizations was greatly diminished.\\" Following the election of Patrick Brown (politician) to the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, the OLA began supporting the provincial PC party.\\"Ontario PCs pick a pro-lifer to lead their rebirth\\", Toronto Star, 9 May 2015.

They were built from 1878 by the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen engineering works. In the mid-1860s the W√ºrttemberg State Railways turned away from the 4-4-0 American-influenced locomotives and went back to 2-4-0 locomotives, because they were cheaper to buy and maintain. They even converted some 4-4-0s to 2-4-0 engines. Because these locomotives had been built over many years, the individual engines differed from one another in certain details and, for example, the boiler pressure was increased from 10 to 12 bar. The engines had a tender of Class 2 T 10 and were recognisable by their large steam dome, that was located just behind the only slightly higher smokestack. Two locomotives ended up in the final DRG renumbering plan of 1925 as the DRG Class 34.81. Number 34 8101 was the former 336, that in 1896 had been converted from a W√ºrttemberg Aa. Number 34 8102, formerly 363, was by contrast newly built in 1891. Both locomotives were retired in 1925.

The \\"sociology\\" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including Marxism, postcolonialism, and Science and Technology Studies, and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as geography and architecture. Edward T. Hall developed the study of Proxemics which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  Definition of space  Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term \\"space\\" has been defined variously by scholars: In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways; 1\\\\. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it. 2\\\\. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions. However, the human geographers‚Äô interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study. Michel Foucault defines space as; ‚ÄúThe space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space‚Ä¶..we live inside a set of relations. Nigel Thrift also defines space as; \\"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable.\\" In short, \\"space\\" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.  History of the sociology of space  Georg Simmel has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field. Simmel wrote on \\"the sociology of space\\" in his 1908 book \\"Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation\\". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies. The category of space long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the topological turn. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels. The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is Michel Foucault‚Äôs essay on ‚ÄúOf Other Spaces‚Äù,Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), ¬ªAndere R√§ume¬´, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-R√§ume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65‚Äì72 in which the author proclaims the ‚Äúage of space‚Äù, and Henri Lefebvre‚Äôs seminal work ‚ÄúLa production de l‚Äôespace‚Äù.Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which David Harvey, Manuel Castells, Edward Soja, and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist Martina L√∂w.L√∂w, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M. Approaches deriving from the post-colonialism discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer Doreen MasseyMassey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, HeidelbergMassey, Doreen (1999b), ¬ªSpaces of Politics¬´, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279‚Äì294 and German sociologist Helmuth Berking,Berking, Helmuth (1998), ¬ª‚Ä∫Global Flows and Local Cultures‚Äπ. √úber die Rekonfiguration sozialer R√§ume im Globalisierungsproze√ü¬´, in: Berliner Journal f√ºr Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381‚Äì392 for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.  Duality of space  Martina L√∂w developed the idea of a \\"relational\\" model of space, which focuses on the ‚Äúorderings‚ÄùL√∂w, Martina (2008), ¬ªThe Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception¬´, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11 of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by Anthony Giddens,Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity whose concept of the ‚Äúduality of structure‚Äù L√∂w extends sociological terms into a ‚Äúduality of space.‚Äù The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action. With respect to the constitution of space, L√∂w distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: ‚Äúspacing‚Äù and ‚Äúsynthesis.‚Äù Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to L√∂w, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people ‚Äì in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. L√∂w calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by Lars Meier (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), Cedric Janowicz (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of Accra), and Silke Streets (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).  Marxist approaches  The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was Henri Lefebvre. He proposed \\"social space\\" to be where the relations of production are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal., p17-19 Lef√®bvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted: * by ‚Äúspatial practice,‚Äù meaning space as reproduced in everyday life * by the ‚Äúrepresentation of space‚Äù, meaning space as developed cognitively * and by ‚Äúspaces of representation,‚Äù by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces. In Lefebvre‚Äôs view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non- reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical- abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation ‚Äì in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space. Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by David Harvey, in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from Fordism to ‚Äúflexible accumulation‚Äù on the experience of space and time.Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford. He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis- prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is ‚Äútime-space compression.‚Äù While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.  Postcolonial theories of space  Theories of space that are inspired by the post-colonialism discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to Doreen Massey, calling a country in Africa a ‚Äúdeveloping country‚Äù is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù world, a view she condemns as \\"Eurocentrism.\\" In this vein, Helmuth Berking criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as ‚Äúglobocentrism.‚Äù He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character Conan the Barbarian is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as McDonald‚Äôs means something different in Moscow than in Paris.  Third Space  Henri Lefebvre (see also Edward Soja) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, ‚ÄúProduction of Space‚Äù. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other. He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad: 1\\\\. First Space (Physical space/perceived space) \\"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it.\\" 2\\\\. Second Space (Mental space/conceived space) \\"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived.\\" 3\\\\. Third Space (Social space/lived space) \\"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols.\\" Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is ‚ÄúThe third space‚Äù formulated by Edward Soja. In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.  Rational view of space  In the work of geographer and critical theorist Nigel Thrift, he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space. First Space is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today‚Äôs technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space. Second space is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. Third space is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. Fourth space is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us.. Scale: the local and the global Andrew Herod Harod, A. 2003. \\"Scale: the local and the global\\". Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE. mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People‚Äôs lives across the globe have been re- scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as globalization, in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of supranational political bodies such as the European Union, the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on \\" The political geography of scale\\".Political Geography. We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‚ÄòAmericanization‚Äô through the process of globalization while the locals‚Äô tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‚Äòs lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‚Äòglobal‚Äô and the ‚Äòlocal‚Äô were brought into question. =Ontological status of the global and the local= Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‚Äòscale‚Äô itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‚Äòregional scale‚Äô or‚Äònational scale‚Äô. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among materialists and idealists. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant‚Äôs idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‚Äòs inspiration, the ‚Äòglobal‚Äô is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‚Äòlocal‚Äô is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‚Äònational‚Äô scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional. The notion of ‚Äòbecoming‚Äô and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialistTaylor, P.J. 1982. \\"A materialist framework for political geography\\", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers. arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‚Äòlocal‚Äôas they have to work to become ‚Äòglobal‚Äô. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‚Äògone global‚Äô, how institutions of governance have ‚Äòbecome‚Äô supranational and how labour unions have sought to ‚Äòglobalize‚Äô their operations to match those of an increasingly ‚Äòglobalized‚Äô city. For the scale ‚Äòglobal‚Äô and ‚Äòlocal‚Äô, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‚Äòis not a movement from one discrete arena to another‚Äô but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‚Äòscale‚Äô is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ‚Äôarenas‚Äôwithin which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions. For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‚Äòglobal‚Äô to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‚Äògo local‚Äô through tailoring its products and operations in different places. =Discourses of the global and the local= Gibson- GrahamGibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. \\"Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame\\" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell. (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed. 1\\\\. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations 2\\\\. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‚Äòsomething more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local‚Äô. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not. 3\\\\. According to French social theorist Bruno Latour, the local and the global ‚Äòoffer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour‚Äôs view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins. 4\\\\. The concept ‚ÄòThe global is local‚Äô was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‚Äòmulti local‚Äò rather than ‚Äòglobal‚Äô. 5\\\\. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet. 6\\\\. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‚Äòglocal.‚Äô There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‚Äòsmall and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global‚Äô. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital ‚Äì those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‚ÄòThink globally and act locally‚Äô viewed by neoliberals. =Metaphors of scale= For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist Bruno Latour argued is that a world of places is ‚Äònetworked‚Äô together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other. For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‚Äòmore accurate‚Äôrepresentation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon. Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,AHerod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002.

XHMAP and XHOPA were primarily intended to improve the available local television service in town, though they each broadcast at a power of 300 watts; there was no national television service in Monclova when they were awarded. XHOPA eventually disappeared. XHMAP, meanwhile, cycled through various programming sources over the years. It carried Galavisi√≥n, Telemundo and both Imevisi√≥n networks at various times. Ultimately, the station began rebroadcasting XHRCG- TV from Saltillo. On August 18, 2009, miners from the union seized XHMAP-TV and shut the station down. They sought to regain control of the station and hoped to modernize its antiquated transmission equipment. The miners also alleged that the president and secretary of the Comit√© Pro-Antena Parab√≥lica had made a deal to allow the station to rebroadcast XHRCG. After 2009, the station's programming source changed again, to channel 4 on the local cable system operated by N√∫cleo Radio Televisi√≥n, a company of Rolando Gonz√°lez Trevi√±o. NRT owned the cable system, the channel and local FM stations XHWGR- FM and XHEMF-FM. In 2014, after the arrest of Gonz√°lez Trevi√±o in the United States on money laundering charges, XHMAP went off the air. In 2016, XHMAP migrated to digital television on physical channel 36. As Azteca 7 was assigned virtual channel 7 nationwide, virtual channel 29 was given to XHMAP to broadcast. In May 2017, XHMAP relaunched as Canal 29 with a local schedule of programs. The relaunched XHMAP exposed itself to criticism that it was being run commercially, even though it is a noncommercial station; the concessionaire claimed that Hiradier Huerta Medrano, former miners' union leader, was making money off the sale of advertisements on XHMAP.

The design became one of the most recognized political brand logos during the 2008 U.S. presidential election, and was used again for Obama's reelection campaign and for the Obama Foundation. Process Logo used by Obama while a U.S. Senator, prior to his presidential bid The logo was designed by Chicago-based Sender LLC (a brand development and design company) on assignment from Chicago-based Mode Project (a motion design studio). The latter had been brought on board early on by David Axelrod, Obama's chief campaign strategist, although it had never done a political identity before. Creative director and brand strategist Sol Sender led the design team of three which included Amanda Gentry and Andy Keene. Project managers at Mode Project were Colin Carter and Steve Juras. \\"We were looking at the \\"o\\" of his name and had the idea of a rising sun and a new day,\\" according to Sender. \\"The sun rising over the horizon evoked a new sense of hope.\\" \\"The design expression was so constrained and so bland for so many years in politics,\\" Sender says. \\"I think we had a fresh approach because we'd never worked on a campaign before\\" ‚Äî and, of course, the power of the logo had a lot to do with \\"the power of the candidate's message.\\" The final design was decided among seven or eight options in the first round. \\"In terms of our internal process, though, I believe the logo ‚Äî as we now know it ‚Äî came out of a second round of design explorations. At any rate, it happened quite quickly, all things considered. The entire undertaking took less than two weeks.\\" The design began late in 2006 and the finished logo made its debut when Obama officially announced his candidacy for presidency February 10, 2007 in Springfield, Illinois. John Slabyk and Scott Thomas, designers with the Obama campaign oversaw the customization of the logo for 12 different identity groups as well as for each state with 50 additional versions.

The Boston Globe beamed that \\"the ever-present rising sun logo has the feeling of a hot new Internet company.\\" \\"It begins to break with tradition while also rooting itself in tradition,\\" said Peter Krivkovich, CEO of Cramer-Krasselt advertising agency in Chicago. \\"Patriotism is the foundation, but above that is hope, opportunity, newness.\\" David Morrison, president of Philadelphia- based market research firm Twentysomething Inc., said the logo has \\"a nice, contemporary, dynamic, youthful vibe about it.\\" Designer Michael Bierut called Obama's branding \\"just as good or better\\" as the best commercial brand designs. \\"Every time you look, all those signs are perfect,\\" Beirut said. \\"Graphic designers like me don't understand how it's happening. It's unprecedented and inconceivable to us.

Prior to TrueCar, he was the founder and CEO of CarsDirect.com, an online automotive research portal and car-buying service that introduced upfront pricing to auto retail. He has advised a number of automotive businesses including Tesla motors. Early life and education Painter was born in Seattle on September 30, 1968 and grew up in Placer County, California, near Sacramento. He started his first company, Scott's Auto Dealing, at the age of 14. After high school, he joined the United States Army and trained to become a Spanish interrogator. He attended West Point, where he studied military strategy and systems engineering. While at West Point he served as class president before transferring to UC Berkeley where he studied political economics. Career Painter left UC Berkeley prior to graduation to sell his first auto-related startup company, AUTOAccess, an electronic database of used cars for sale. Prior to founding TrueCar, he initiated and was involved in other ventures. Painter was also an early advisor to Tesla. TrueCar Painter at race track with TrueCar Racing In 2005, Painter founded TrueCar, Inc., which is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. TrueCar is a negotiation-free car buying platform. TrueCar provides car-buyers with a transparent insight into what other buyers have paid, upfront pricing information, and a network of TrueCar certified dealers. In August 2015, Painter stepped down as CEO.https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-truecar-quarterly- results-20150806-story.html He was replaced by Chip Perry as of Dec.15, 2015.http://true.com/press-release/truecar-names-chip-perry-chief-executive- officer-2/ Fair, Inc. Painter‚Äôs current venture is Fair, Inc., an automotive financial technology company. Disruption with the auto industry In late 2011, TrueCar raised significant debt and equity capital (>$200m) which enabled it to advertise nationally on television. Consumer usage increased in response to the television campaign that was developed in conjunction with TrueCar investor Guthy-Renker, but dealer and industry criticism was significant and well documented in a series of Automotive News articles. Painter, who is commonly associated with vehicle pricing transparency, up-front pricing and the value of big data in auto retail, received pushback from auto dealers and manufacturers over the fear that TrueCar was responsible for significant retail price discounting. The industry resistance led to nearly a dozen states launching investigations into the company's practices and policies. As a result, Painter and TrueCar underwent a nine-month regulatory compliance overhaul and initiated industry outreach programs. TrueCar went through a business turnaround in 2012 that resulted in the company reporting in its S-1 filing that it had generated positive adjusted EBITDA in 2013 after having lost over $40 million in 2012. In November 2012, Painter spoke directly to the industry about the current status of TrueCar in an Autoline TV interview and Painter was also recently featured in Forbes. In November 2012, TrueCar went back on television with new commercials and a completely new version of its web experience for both dealers and consumers. Honors The Technology Council of Southern California named Painter its 2009 and 2012 Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2011 and 2014, he was named a finalist for the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Greater Los Angeles Area.

A time-of-flight camera (ToF camera) is a range imaging camera system that employs time-of- flight techniques to resolve distance between the camera and the subject for each point of the image, by measuring the round trip time of an artificial light signal provided by a laser or an LED. Laser-based time-of-flight cameras are part of a broader class of scannerless LIDAR, in which the entire scene is captured with each laser pulse, as opposed to point-by-point with a laser beam such as in scanning LIDAR systems. Time-of-flight camera products for civil applications began to emerge around 2000, as the semiconductor processes allowed the production of components fast enough for such devices. The systems cover ranges of a few centimeters up to several kilometers. The distance resolution is about 1 cm. The spatial resolution of time-of-flight cameras is generally low compared to standard 2D video cameras, with most commercially available devices at 320 √ó 240 pixels or less as of 2011. Compared to other 3D laser scanning methods for capturing 3D images, TOF cameras operate more quickly by providing up to 160 operations per second.http://ww2.bluetechnix.com/en/products/depthsensing/list/argos/ Types of devices Several different technologies for time-of-flight cameras have been developed. =RF-modulated light sources with phase detectors= Photonic Mixer Devices (PMD),Christoph Heckenkamp: Das magische Auge - Grundlagen der Bildverarbeitung: Das PMD Prinzip. In: Inspect. Nr. 1, 2008, S. 25‚Äì28. the Swiss Ranger, and CanestaVision work by modulating the outgoing beam with an RF carrier, then measuring the phase shift of that carrier on the receiver side. This approach has a modular error challenge: measured ranges are modulo the RF carrier wavelength. The Swiss Ranger is a compact, short-range device, with ranges of 5 or 10 meters and a resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. With phase unwrapping algorithms, the maximum uniqueness range can be increased. The PMD can provide ranges up to 60 m. Illumination is pulsed LEDs rather than a laser. CanestaVision developer Canesta was purchased by Microsoft in 2010. The Kinect2 for Xbox One was based on ToF technology from Canesta. =Range gated imagers= These devices have a built-in shutter in the image sensor that opens and closes at the same rate as the light pulses are sent out. Because part of every returning pulse is blocked by the shutter according to its time of arrival, the amount of light received relates to the distance the pulse has traveled. The distance can be calculated using the equation, z = R (S2 ‚àí S1) / 2(S1 \\\\+ S2) + R / 2 for an ideal camera. R is the camera range, determined by the round trip of the light pulse, S1 the amount of the light pulse that is received, and S2 the amount of the light pulse that is blocked. The ZCam by 3DV Systems is a range-gated system. Microsoft purchased 3DV in 2009. Microsoft's second-generation Kinect sensor was developed using knowledge gained from Canesta and 3DV Systems. Similar principles are used in the ToF camera line developed by the Fraunhofer Institute of Microelectronic Circuits and Systems and TriDiCam. These cameras employ photodetectors with a fast electronic shutter. The depth resolution of ToF cameras can be improved with ultra-fast gating intensified CCD cameras. These cameras provide gating times down to 200ps and enable ToF setup with sub-millimeter depth resolution. Range gated imagers can also be used in 2D imaging to suppress anything outside a specified distance range, such as to see through fog. A pulsed laser provides illumination, and an optical gate allows light to reach the imager only during the desired time period. =Direct Time-of-Flight imagers= These devices measure the direct time-of-flight required for a single laser pulse to leave the camera and reflect back onto the focal plane array. Also known as \\"trigger mode\\", the 3D images captured using this methodology image complete spatial and temporal data, recording full 3D scenes with single laser pulse. This allows rapid acquisition and rapid real-time processing of scene information. For time-sensitive autonomous operations, this approach has been demonstrated for autonomous space testing and operation such as used on the OSIRIS-REx Bennu asteroid sample and return mission and autonomous helicopter landing.http://e-vmi.com/pdf/2012_VMI_AUVSI_Report.pdf Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc. provides application specific (e.g. aerial, automotive, space) Direct TOF vision systems known as 3D Flash LIDAR cameras. Their approach utilizes InGaAs Avalanche Photo Diode (APD) or PIN photodetector arrays capable of imaging laser pulse in the 980 nm to 1600 nm wavelengths. Components A time-of-flight camera consists of the following components: * Illumination unit: It illuminates the scene. For RF-modulated light sources with phase detector imagers, the light has to be modulated with high speeds up to 100 MHz, only LEDs or laser diodes are feasible. For Direct TOF imagers, a single pulse per frame (e.g. 30 Hz) is used. The illumination normally uses infrared light to make the illumination unobtrusive. * Optics: A lens gathers the reflected light and images the environment onto the image sensor (focal plane array). An optical band-pass filter only passes the light with the same wavelength as the illumination unit. This helps suppress non-pertinent light and reduce noise. * Image sensor: This is the heart of the TOF camera. Each pixel measures the time the light has taken to travel from the illumination unit (laser or LED) to the object and back to the focal plane array. Several different approaches are used for timing; see Types of devices above. * Driver electronics: Both the illumination unit and the image sensor have to be controlled by high speed signals and synchronized. These signals have to be very accurate to obtain a high resolution. For example, if the signals between the illumination unit and the sensor shift by only 10 picoseconds, the distance changes by 1.5 mm. For comparison: current CPUs reach frequencies of up to 3 GHz, corresponding to clock cycles of about 300 ps - the corresponding 'resolution' is only 45 mm. * Computation/Interface: The distance is calculated directly in the camera. To obtain good performance, some calibration data is also used. The camera then provides a distance image over some interface, for example USB or Ethernet. Principle Principle of operation of a time-of-flight camera: In the pulsed method (1), the distance, d = , where c is the speed of light, t is the length of the pulse, q1 is the accumulated charge in the pixel when light is emitted and q2 is the accumulated charge when it is not. In the continuous-wave method (2), d = arctan . Diagrams illustrating the principle of a time-of-flight camera with analog timing The simplest version of a time-of-flight camera uses light pulses or a single light pulse. The illumination is switched on for a very short time, the resulting light pulse illuminates the scene and is reflected by the objects in the field of view. The camera lens gathers the reflected light and images it onto the sensor or focal plane array. Depending upon the distance, the incoming light experiences a delay. As light has a speed of approximately c = 300,000,000 meters per second, this delay is very short: an object 2.5 m away will delay the light by:\\"CCD/CMOS Lock-In Pixel for Range Imaging: Challenges, Limitations and State-of-the-Art\\" - CSEM :t_D = 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac D c = 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac {2.5\\\\;\\\\mathrm{m}} {300\\\\;000\\\\;000\\\\;\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{m}}{\\\\mathrm{s}}} = 0.000\\\\;000\\\\;016\\\\;66\\\\;\\\\mathrm{s} = 16.66 \\\\;\\\\mathrm{ns} For amplitude modulated arrays, the pulse width of the illumination determines the maximum range the camera can handle. With a pulse width of e.g. 50 ns, the range is limited to :D_\\\\mathrm{max} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot c \\\\cdot t_0 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot 300\\\\;000\\\\;000\\\\;\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{m}}{\\\\mathrm{s}} \\\\cdot 0.000\\\\;000\\\\;05\\\\;\\\\mathrm{s} =!\\\\ 7.5\\\\;\\\\mathrm{m} These short times show that the illumination unit is a critical part of the system. Only with special LEDs or lasers is it possible to generate such short pulses. The single pixel consists of a photo sensitive element (e.g. a photo diode). It converts the incoming light into a current. In analog timing imagers, connected to the photo diode are fast switches, which direct the current to one of two (or several) memory elements (e.g. a capacitor) that act as summation elements. In digital timing imagers, a time counter, that can be running at several gigahertz, is connected to each photodetector pixel and stops counting when light is sensed. In the diagram of an amplitude modulated array analog timer, the pixel uses two switches (G1 and G2) and two memory elements (S1 and S2). The switches are controlled by a pulse with the same length as the light pulse, where the control signal of switch G2 is delayed by exactly the pulse width. Depending on the delay, only part of the light pulse is sampled through G1 in S1, the other part is stored in S2. Depending on the distance, the ratio between S1 and S2 changes as depicted in the drawing. Because only small amounts of light hit the sensor within 50 ns, not only one but several thousand pulses are sent out (repetition rate tR) and gathered, thus increasing the signal to noise ratio. After the exposure, the pixel is read out and the following stages measure the signals S1 and S2. As the length of the light pulse is defined, the distance can be calculated with the formula: :D = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot c \\\\cdot t_0 \\\\cdot \\\\frac {S2} {S1 + S2} In the example, the signals have the following values: S1 = 0.66 and S2 = 0.33. The distance is therefore: :D = 7.5\\\\;\\\\mathrm{m} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {0.33} {0.33 + 0.66} = 2.5\\\\;\\\\mathrm{m} In the presence of background light, the memory elements receive an additional part of the signal. This would disturb the distance measurement. To eliminate the background part of the signal, the whole measurement can be performed a second time with the illumination switched off. If the objects are further away than the distance range, the result is also wrong. Here, a second measurement with the control signals delayed by an additional pulse width helps to suppress such objects. Other systems work with a sinusoidally modulated light source instead of the pulse source. For direct TOF imagers, such as 3D Flash LIDAR, a single short pulse from 5 to 10 ns is emitted by the laser. The T-zero event (the time the pulse leaves the camera) is established by capturing the pulse directly and routing this timing onto the focal plane array. T-zero is used to compare the return time of the returning reflected pulse on the various pixels of the focal plane array. By comparing T-zero and the captured returned pulse and comparing the time difference, each pixel accurately outputs a direct time-of- flight measurement. The round trip of a single pulse for 100 meters is 660 ns. With a 10 ns pulse, the scene is illuminated and the range and intensity captured in less than 1 microsecond. Advantages =Simplicity= In contrast to stereo vision or triangulation systems, the whole system is very compact: the illumination is placed just next to the lens, whereas the other systems need a certain minimum base line. In contrast to laser scanning systems, no mechanical moving parts are needed. =Efficient distance algorithm= It is a direct process to extract the distance information out of the output signals of the TOF sensor. As a result, this task uses only a small amount of processing power, again in contrast to stereo vision, where complex correlation algorithms are implemented. After the distance data has been extracted, object detection, for example, is also a straightforward process to carry out because the algorithms are not disturbed by patterns on the object. =Speed= Time-of-flight cameras are able to measure the distances within a complete scene with a single shot. As the cameras reach up to 160 frames per second, they are ideally suited to be used in real-time applications. Disadvantages =Background light= When using CMOS or other integrating detectors or sensors that use visible or near infra-red light (400 nm - 700 nm), although most of the background light coming from artificial lighting or the sun is suppressed, the pixel still has to provide a high dynamic range. The background light also generates electrons, which have to be stored. For example, the illumination units in many of today's TOF cameras can provide an illumination level of about 1 watt. The Sun has an illumination power of about 1050 watts per square meter, and 50 watts after the optical band-pass filter. Therefore, if the illuminated scene has a size of 1 square meter, the light from the sun is 50 times stronger than the modulated signal. For non- integrating TOF sensors that do not integrate light over time and are using near-infrared detectors (InGaAs) to capture the short laser pulse, direct viewing of the sun is a non-issue because the image is not integrated over time, rather captured within a short acquisition cycle typically less than 1 microsecond. Such TOF sensors are used in space applications and in consideration for automotive applications. =Interference= In certain types of TOF devices (but not all of them), if several time-of-flight cameras are running at the same time, the TOF cameras may disturb each other's measurements. There exist several possibilities for dealing with this problem: * Time multiplexing: A control system starts the measurement of the individual cameras consecutively, so that only one illumination unit is active at a time. * Different modulation frequencies: If the cameras modulate their light with different modulation frequencies, their light is collected in the other systems only as background illumination but does not disturb the distance measurement. For Direct TOF type cameras that use a single laser pulse for illumination, because the single laser pulse is short (e.g. 10 nanoseconds), the round trip TOF to and from the objects in the field of view is correspondingly short (e.g. 100 meters = 660 ns TOF round trip). For an imager capturing at 30 Hz, the probability of an interfering interaction is the time that the camera acquisition gate is open divided by the time between laser pulses or approximately 1 in 50,000 (0.66 Œºs divided by 33 ms). =Multiple reflections= In contrast to laser scanning systems where a single point is illuminated, the time-of-flight cameras illuminate a whole scene. For a phase difference device (amplitude modulated array), due to multiple reflections, the light may reach the objects along several paths. Therefore, the measured distance may be greater than the true distance. Direct TOF imagers are vulnerable if the light is reflecting from a specular surface. There are published papers available that outline the strengths and weaknesses of the various TOF devices and approaches. Applications Range image of a human face captured with a time-of-flight camera (artist‚Äôs depiction) = Automotive applications = Time-of-flight cameras are used in assistance and safety functions for advanced automotive applications such as active pedestrian safety, precrash detection and indoor applications like out-of-position (OOP) detection. =Human-machine interfaces and gaming= As time-of-flight cameras provide distance images in real time, it is easy to track movements of humans. This allows new interactions with consumer devices such as televisions. Another topic is to use this type of cameras to interact with games on video game consoles. The second-generation Kinect sensor originally included with the Xbox One console used a time-of-flight camera for its range imaging, enabling natural user interfaces and gaming applications using computer vision and gesture recognition techniques. Creative and Intel also provide a similar type of interactive gesture time-of-flight camera for gaming, the Senz3D based on the DepthSense 325 camera of Softkinetic.. Infineon and PMD Technologies enable tiny integrated 3D depth cameras for close-range gesture control of consumer devices like all-in-one PCs and laptops (Picco flexx and Picco monstar cameras). = Smartphone cameras = The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 features three rear-facing camera lenses and a ToF camera (only 10+ version). As of 2019, several smartphones include time-of-flight cameras. These are mainly used to improve the quality of photos by providing the camera software with information about foreground and background. The first mobile phone to employ such technology is the LG G3, released in early 2014.Time-of-flight Technology Designed into Smartphone ‚Äì SensorTips.com on October 17, 2014 =Measurement and machine vision= Range image with height measurements Other applications are measurement tasks, e.g. for the fill height in silos. In industrial machine vision, the time-of-flight camera helps to classify and locate objects for use by robots, such as items passing by on a conveyor. Door controls can distinguish easily between animals and humans reaching the door. =Robotics= Another use of these cameras is the field of robotics: Mobile robots can build up a map of their surroundings very quickly, enabling them to avoid obstacles or follow a leading person. As the distance calculation is simple, only little computational power is used. =Earth topography= ToF cameras have been used to obtain digital elevation models of the Earth's surface topography, for studies in geomorphology.

It was designed and built by Colonel Orlando Metcalfe Poe and Major Godfrey Weitzel, and was the most expensive lighthouse ever built on the Great Lakes. Because of the challenges of building on a shoal, including laying an underwater crib, it is said to be the \\"most spectacular engineering achievement\\" in lighthouse construction on Lake Huron. It took four years to build because weather limited work to mostly the summer season. Workers lived in a structure at the site; one of the limiting conditions. It ranks high as an engineering achievement among all the lighthouses built on the Great lakes. History =Overview= From 1852 to the beginning of the 20th century, the United States Lighthouse Board was active in building lighthouses to support ship traffic on the Great Lakes. Between 1852 and 1860, it built 26 new lights. Even as the United States Civil War and its aftermath slowed construction, it completed a dozen new lights in that decade. In the 1870s alone, it built 43 new lights on the Lakes. During the 1880s, more than 100 lights were constructed.Beacons in the Night, Clarke Historical Library. Central Michigan University.Hyde, Charles K., and Ann and John Mahan. The Northern Lights: Lighthouses of the Upper Great Lakes. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1995. . As the new century began, the Lighthouse Board operated 334 major lights, 67 fog horns and 563 buoys on the Great Lakes. During the 19th century, design of Great Lakes lights slowly evolved. Until 1870 the most common design was to build a keeper's dwelling with the light on the dwelling's roof or on a relatively small square tower attached to the house. In the 1870s, so as to raise lights to a higher focal plane, conical brick towers, usually between 80 and 100 feet tall, were constructed. In the 1890s steel-lined towers began to replace the older generation of brick buildings. See Big Sable Point Light for a striking transition and transformation. The Spectacle Reef Light was built during a forty-year period‚Äîbetween 1870 and 1910‚Äîwhen engineers began to build lights on isolated islands, reefs, and shoals that were significant navigational hazards. To that time, light ships were the only practical way to mark the hazards. They were dangerous for the sailors who manned them, and difficult to maintain. > \\"Worse, regardless of the type of anchors used, lightships could be blown > off their expected location in severe storms, making them a potential > liability in the worst weather when captains would depend on the charted > location of these lights to measure their own ship's distance from dangerous > rocks.\\" See, United States lightship Huron (LV-103). Using underwater crib designs, the Board built the Waugoshance Light (1851) on a shoal, and demonstrated a \\"new level of expertise\\" in constructing of the Spectacle Reef Light (1874), Stannard Rock Light (1882), and Detroit River (Bar Point Shoal) (also known as the Detroit River Entrance Light) (1885). \\"The long and expensive process of building lights\\" in remote and difficult sites \\"ended in nationally publicized engineering projects that constructed\\" Rock of Ages Light (1908) and the White Shoal (1910) lights. In the first three decades of the twentieth century, the Lighthouse Board and the new Lighthouse Service continued to build new lights on the Great Lakes. For 1925, the Board administered around the Great Lakes: 433 major lights; ten lightships; 129 fog signals; and about 1,000 buoys. Of these 1,771 navigational aids, only 160 stations had resident keepers. By that time, most navigational aids were automated. Most of the 21st century's Great Lakes lighthouses (excepting e.g., Poe Reef Light and Gravelly Shoal Light) had been constructed by 1925. Building on shoals was part of a larger pattern of building 14 reef lights around Michigan, also intended to help ships navigate through and around the shoals and hazards around the Straits of Mackinac.Roberts, Bruce; Jones, Ray. (September 2002) American Lighthouses, 2nd: A Definitive Guide pp. 246‚Äì250, Publisher: Globe Pequot Press 304 pp ; ; . =Construction= The site was first marked by a buoy in 1868.Roach, Jerry, The Ultimate Guide to Upper Michigan Lighthouses, Lighthouse Central, . The construction was undertaken under the auspices of the Lighthouse Board, and was a feat of civil engineering and endurance. Construction began in 1870, in answer to the disastrous loss of a large number of ships during the 1860s at the site; in particular, two schooners ran aground and broke up in 1867. The massive cost of the loss helped convince Congress that it would be more cost effective to build a light and reduce the potential of future shipwrecks. The lighthouse is built upon a reef shaped like a pair of eyeglasses (hence its name) and is located in the path of littoral commerce on Lake Huron. The increase in freighter traffic through the straits increased the risk of more ship losses without better signing of hazards. The Spectacle Reef Lighthouse cost $406,000. One costly item was the purchase of a steamer to convey the materials to the site. The foundation was laid in a cofferdam protected by a crib made from timber and submerged below the surface. The crib was constructed upon slipways at the depot, like building a ship, then launched and towed by tugboats to the reef, where it was sunk and grounded on the site. This crib is massive: and high (). It created a protected pond, making a base for the cofferdam, a wharf, and worker's quarters. The cofferdam was pumped out to expose the bedrock, upon which the masonry courses were laid. The light's 20-month construction process had to be spread out over a calendar period of four years (1870-1874). No work was possible during the winter, most of the spring, and most of the fall, due to heavy weather. Bois Blanc Island is the nearest point of land, to to the northwest; but neither it nor Ninemile Point, to the south, formed a suitable staging area for construction. This took place entirely on site. After the construction of workers' quarters on the pier, a fourth-order Fresnel lens was temporarily installed on the roof of one of the buildings. Construction was almost complete in the fall of 1873, when the onset of winter's storms forced the work site to be abandoned until the following spring. In the spring of 1874, work on the lighthouse began again. With the installation of the cast-iron lantern room and a new second- order Fresnel lens, the work was complete, and the light was put into service for the first time in June 1874. The location of the lighthouse makes it susceptible to wave fetch, which for this reef is to the southeast. Lake Huron ice fields, known as drift ice, which in this lake can be as much as two or more feet thick and measure thousands of acres in size, are moved by wintertime currents. Masses of these dimensions create \\"an almost irresistible force\\", which for Spectacle Reef Light was \\"overcome by interposing a structure against which the ice is crushed and by which its motion is so impeded that it grounds on the 7-foot shoal.\\" This creates an effective wall \\"against other ice fields.\\" The tower is formed as a \\"frustum of a cone\\". The diameter base rises above water level, and is below water level. As the Coast Guard notes: \\"The focal plane is above the top of the parapet, making it above the top of the submerged rock and above the surface of the water. For up the tower is solid and from them on up it is hollow. In it are five rooms, one above the other each in diameter, with varying heights. The walls of the hollow portion are at the bottom, tapering to at the spring of the cornice.\\" Just below the cornice, the blocks of stone are thick. They are interlocked in each course, and fastened together with wrought iron bolts thick and long. Likewise, the tower is bolted to the foundation rock with bolts long. After \\"the stones were in place they were plugged with pure portland cement, which is now as hard as the stone itself. Hence the tower is, in effect, a monolith.\\" The stones were cut at the depot at Scammon's Harbor, away. They were fitted, course by course, on a platform of masonry. The stones fit so well that each course was laid in three days: to set, drill, and bolt. The light has been described as \\"the best specimen of monolithic stone masonry in the United States\\" and \\"one of the greatest engineering feats on the Great Lakes.\\" In September 1872, a severe gale did considerable damage to the lighthouse, which had to be repaired at very great expense. The term \\"gale\\" is being used loosely, as there was no wind speed device being monitored in the winter at that location. But, in a similar location and storm on Lake Superior at Granite Island, Michigan, wind speeds of were recorded on January 18, 2003. \\"After the winter of 1873-74, when the keepers returned to the newly completed tower, they found the ice piled against it at a height of , or higher than the doorway, and they could not gain entrance until they had cut away the iceberg of which the lighthouse formed the core.\\" The light has an attached fog signal building, oil house and storage building. There are davits to raise and lower boats. The Lighthouse Board built a model of this light that was featured in the Aids to Navigation display at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, also known as \\"The Chicago World's Fair\\" in Chicago, Illinois. The combination of a crib foundation with monolithic stone masonry worked so well that the Lighthouse Board used the design and a similar process in constructing the Stannard Rock Light in Lake Superior in 1878. The Board achieved economies by getting 'double duty' from the \\"costly apparatus and machinery purchased\\" for the Spectacle Reef project. Current status Undated aerial view by USCG The original second-order Fresnel lens (by HenryLepaute of Paris, France) was removed in 1982. It is now on display at the Inland Seas Maritime Museum (also known as the Great Lakes Historical Society Museum) at the Vermilion Light in Vermilion, Ohio. Since the Fresnel lens was replaced by a modern acrylic lens, the Spectacle Reef Light has continued to serve as an active aid to navigation as of 2007.
