History and governance  Founded in 1992 at the In the City conference in Manchester and formally incorporated in January 1993 as The Managers Forum Ltd. and known as the IMF (International Managers Forum), it changed its name in 2005 to the Music Managers Forum to avoid ambiguity with other organisations, becoming known as the MMF. The co-chairs at the time Diane Wagg and Stephen Budd appointed Annabella Coldrick as CEO in January 2016 with previous CEO Jon Webster becoming president. In May 2017, Jon Webster stood down as president. Following a change in governance, in July 2017 a round of board elections was held. Designed to increase diversity and inclusivity, the new rules mean the board must rotate annually. Board members are now elected to serve only a fixed three-year term, and at least five members will be required to stand down each year. During 2017‚Äôs board elections, Stephen Budd stepped down as co-chair, with Diane Wagg becoming the sole-chair, and Biffy Clyro co-manager Paul Craig stepping into the newly created role of Vice Chair.

Letters Patent of Incorporation were issued on November 22, 1999 with Douglas Sifton, Muriel Edwards and Joan Chalovich as the first directors. The Foundation's creation grew out of the gradual deterioration of a limestone building believed to be the oldest building in the Town of Cobourg, Ontario, Canada.  Purpose  The first of the objects of incorporation was \\"to acquire, restore and preserve the ancient limestone building known as 'The Barracks', located in the Town of Cobourg in the County of Northumberland, and to dedicate it to public use\\". In 2000 the old building was purchased and restoration work begun. On June 9, 2012 the building was opened to the public as the Exhibition Hall of the Sifton-Cook Heritage Centre, named after two of the founding members. Cobourg \\"Barracks\\" - east view  Charitable Status  On February 4, 2000 Cobourg Museum Foundation Inc. was designated as a Charitable Organization by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. It has received some funding from federal and provincial programs and has membership in the vicinity of 100 individuals and families.  Further Development  File:Model_Sifton_Cook_Heritage_Centre.jpgSite Plan showing Administrative Cottage and Exhibition Hall In 2008, an 1860s workman's cottage, located on a nearby site slated for redevelopment, was donated to the Foundation and moved on site. Now fully restored, it houses a Visitors' Centre including a gift shop and research centre.  Ongoing Projects  While the first project of the CMF was the restoration of its two buildings and their development into a local heritage centre, other small projects were undertaken concurrently. In 2002 the CMF began its Outreach Program by putting on the first of its annual February Ontario Heritage Day displays at a local mall. In 2003 it continued its Outreach Program by putting on an exhibit about the War of 1812 at the local library and staging a re- enactment event. Since then exhibits have been created on the subject of \\"The Role of the Blacksmith in the Early Economy of Upper Canada\\" and \\"The History of the Mississauga First Nation at Alderville\\". On two occasions the \\"barracks\\" has been included in the Doors Open Ontario event in Cobourg. The CMF has participated in Cobourg's popular July 1 Waterfront Festival a number of times with the purpose of informing visitors about the unique history of the area. In its opening season, as Cobourg celebrated the 175th anniversary of its incorporation, the Heritage Centre concentrated on 1837 the year of incorporation. Many of the exhibits were in the form of panels with text and graphics. These are available for viewing on the CMF website. It is envisioned that much of what the Sifton-Cook Heritage Centre will display in the future will be of a digital nature using modern technology. Recent projects of this nature include an interactive timeline of Cobourg's history, which resides on the website and the ongoing cataloguing of books which relate to local history and are owned by members. A picture gallery of local mills is being gathered and posted on Flickr.  Opportunities  The CMF has a strong and active volunteer board of directors, but there are always opportunities for other interested people to take an active part in the guiding of visitors, the development of exhibits, membership development and other areas.

Built from 1901 to 1902, the original building is the oldest active fire station west of the Mississippi River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Postcard showing the Central Fire Station not long after its completion Rear view of the fire station The first group of volunteer firefighters in Davenport were organized in 1856 and called the Independent Fire Engine and Hose Company. The city's early firefighting corps were all volunteer hook and ladder and hose companies, which were paid a small fee to extinguish a fire, and competed against one another for business. They were located throughout the city in makeshift quarters and generally possessed poor equipment. By 1880 the city determined it needed a professional, paid fire department. The Davenport City Council authorized the formation of a municipal fire department in 1882. Marsh Noe was the first fire chief and twelve men made up the first paid fire department. with The city's first firehouse, Hose Station No. 1, had been built on Perry Street in 1877 for the Fire King Engine 2nd Hose Company. Before the turn of the 20th-century, the city built other small hose stations throughout the city. By 1901 the city decided it needed a new and larger fire station downtown. At this time there were six hose companies located throughout the city, a citywide alarm system was in place as well as a fire hydrant network. The city and its buildings in the downtown area continued to grow in size and numbers. The fire department also grew in size so a larger station was needed to care for all of these realities. Local architect Gustav Hanssen was contracted to build the new station. He had designed several homes in the city including Sacred Heart Rectory, which is also on the National Register of Historic Places. The location of a double engine firehouse across West Fourth Street from the Scott County Court House was selected as the location for the new building. The building was opened in 1902, which makes it the oldest active fire station west of the Mississippi River. It was built at a cost of $21,000. As the city and the fire department grew a two-story annex was added to the rear of the building around 1940. It added three additional truck bays. The building continues to serve as a fire station although it had space and access problems. The station itself houses Engine 1, Engine 2, Truck 1 (also known as Bubba II, or \\"The Big Show\\"), and District Chief 1. In 2015 the city addressed the space problems of the facility. It announced in February that a rectangular two-story addition would be built with five fire engine bays to the east of the original fire station, creating an \\"L\\" shaped structure. It replaces the addition built in the 1940s, which was torn down. The original station has been maintained and houses the fireboat, air van, and brush rig on the first floor and the second floor houses the administrative offices for the department. Access issues were also addressed by the new addition. Architecture The 2016 building on the left and the 1902 building on the right. Davenport's fire stations have employed the Italianate style and the Central Fire Station is no exception. It also employs elements of the Neoclassical style as well. The historic building is a two-story structure and features three bays across its main fa√ßade, which faces West Fourth Street. Two towers flank the main entrance, which is on Scott Street. The Italianate elements are found in the hose tower and the low hipped roof. The Neoclassical elements are found in the pedimented entrance and in the round-arched window heads and their simplified keystones. The main floor of the building is an open room with no supporting posts. When it was built it could hold four hose wagons and had stalls for ten horses that pulled the wagons. The stalls were paved with vitrified brick, and each had its own sewer connect. There was also a ventilation system to help eliminate odors and flies. The taller tower had a bell loft and cornice that were removed sometime before 1953. It was then made to look like the shorter tower. A bell, cast in 1869 by Michael Donahue, contained 200 silver dollars to give it a proper ring and was hung in the tall tower. The tower, then as now, was used to hang the fire hoses to dry. Historically, the second floor contained the chief's bedroom, office, and bathroom. There was also a room for a switchboard and repeater. The rest of the second floor was taken up by a dormitory, locker room and bathroom for the firefighters. Three additions have been added to the building over the years. The first is attached to the back of the building facing Scott Street and was added around 1940. It was a brick structure that contained a three-bay garage with a second floor above. It featured elements of the Art Deco style. The second addition is a small, one-story attachment on the northwest corner of the building that was added in 1950. Both the c. 1940 and the 1950 additions were removed when the 2016 addition was built. The newest addition designed by the Boston-based firm \\"The Galante Architecture Studio\\", exhibits elements of Modern architecture, while linking colors and materials to the original building.

It sells bathroom, kitchen and lighting hardware, appliances and other supplies. The company is headquartered in Chico, California, United States.  History  In 1995, Build.com was launched by David Berman who was at the time a successful plumbing wholesaler. Berman's new Build.com enterprise built websites for companies in the building products industry and Berman launched the company officially at the 1995 Kitchen and Bath Show (KBIS) in New Orleans that year. To launch the company he built a website for German faucet company, Grohe. Berman worked with Al DeGenova, Grohe America's head of marketing, and traded the website for a corner of the Grohe America booth at the KBIS trade show. At this point in the infancy of the internet, Grohe.com represented the first website in the U.S. plumbing industry. Following the Grohe America website, Build.com acquired other clients including Delta Faucets. Quickly, Berman realized the power of e-commerce and launched retail sites: Faucet.com, Lighting.com, etc. The url Build.com became an umbrella site for all of Berman's e-commerce kitchen and bath products websites (the website design company became BuildingOnline.com and was based in Dana Point, CA). In 1999, Christian Friedland and David Boctor created an e-commerce website called FaucetDirect to sell plumbing supplies. The pair offered 40% of their business for $40,000 to their employer, Slakey Brothers, but the offer was declined. The team continued to work on the website and launched FaucetDirect.com, which they operated out of Friedland's condo.Meredith Cooper. \\"DIY Webmaster: Improvement Direct's Chris Friedland takes on Home Depot and Lowe's\\", \\"News & Review\\", 22 February 2007.

By 2006 Friedland, who owned 52% of the company, began seeking venture capitalist investments, which led him to sell the business to British plumbing and heating equipment distributor Wolseley (renamed Ferguson plc in 2017) for $35 million. Wolseley purchased the build.com domain in 2009 from David Berman, which allowed Friedland to rebrand the site with its current name.

He was a member of the Ghica noble family, which had Albanian origin. Later in life he changed his name to the Albanian form Gjika, for more credentials in his quest for the Albanian throne.Paul Cernovodeanu et al., Elena Ghica - Dora d'Istria. Online at Ghyka.net He was a pretender to the Albanian throne. A committee was founded in Paris by Dervish Hima and Dimitri Papazoglou, an Aromanian captain that sought to make Ghica the prince of Albania. Good relations were maintained between Ghica and Ismail Qemali, an Albanian leader involved in the Albanian national movement. Writing on the Albanian struggle against the Ottomans at the beginning of the 20th century, British journalist and foreign correspondent for the Manchester Guardian in the Balkans H. N. Brailsford spoke the following in his book Macedonia; Its Races and Their Future (1906): \\"The second claimant (for a possible future Albanian State) is a certain Prince Albert Ghica, who comes of a family of Albanian origin, long resident in Roumania. It has given Hospodars (Governors) to the old Wallachian provinces and diplomats to the modern kingdom, and enjoys princely rank in the Austrian Empire. Prince Albert is a comparatively young man with plausible manners and a dubious past, who speaks fluent French, and knows neither one word of the Albanian language nor the elements of Albanian geography. He has been chosen honorary president by one of the numerous clubs of Albanian immigrants in Bucharest, and on the strength of this social honour he poses in European hotels as the chief-elect of the Albanian people. He talks of venturing in person into Albania and raising the flag of revolt.

He married Margaret Dowling in London in April 1905. He later seemed to have abandoned his bid for throne, as the personal letters Austrian Baron Franz Nopcsa von Fels≈ë-Szilv√°s, himself a pretender to the Albanian throne, suggest. They state the following: \\"Albert Ghica, who had been a pretender to the Albanian throne himself, had managed to interest the Duke of Montpensier in the Albanian throne. He ceded his 'rights,' which were recognized by no one as a matter of fact, to the duke and began to campaign on his behalf in exchange for an appropriate remuneration.\\"Robert Elsie, The Viennese scholar who almost became King of Albania: Baron Franz Nopcsa and his contribution to Albanian studies, East European Quarterly, Vol. 33, 1999.

Over the decades worked alongside some of the biggest names of British theatre, and toured extensively in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Vibart gained a reputation as an exceptionally reliable actor, and it was noted on the occasion of his 10,000th stage appearance in 1923 that he had never once in his career missed a rehearsal or performance through illness or lack of dedication.\\"The Deadhead's Diary\\" NZ Truth, 15-09-1923.

The town is identified with ruins at Sidi Bellater, Algiers. History Quiza was originally a small Berber village, with Phoenician roots. It grew under the Roman empire. Around 120 AD, the emperor Hadrian erected an arch in the city. William Smith identified Quiza with Giza near Oran, Algeria.Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) More recent investigations have identified it with present- day El-Benian on the coast road between Mostaga and Dara.

It was first announced on 13 November 1981, and piloted between January 1982 and July 1983, funding 3,331 individuals. Introduced nationwide in 1983 against a background of mass unemployment in Britain, it went on to fund 325,000 people, including Creation Records head Alan McGee; Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton; artist Tracey Emin and the founders of Viz magazine. Anyone wishing to claim money under the scheme was required to fund the first ¬£1000 out of their own funds, and also to produce a basic business plan. Proponents of the scheme believed that it would have a great impact on unemployment, and support entrepreneurship. It was a UK tax reliefs launched in 1994. Critics pointed to figures which suggested that one in six of the start-up businesses failed in the first year, and said that it had no significant impact on unemployment figures as most of the start-ups were sole-trading operations. A similar scheme, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance was set up in Ireland. On 6 October 2010, a plan was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to revive the scheme, giving mentoring and funding of up to ¬£2000 to those unemployed for over six months and wishing to start up their own business. The funding would include a weekly payment linked to the value of their benefit, and ¬£1000 for the purchase of equipment.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands in an isolated position overlooking and to the north of the M50 motorway. To its north are the earthworks of a former medieval village. History The church dates from the 12th century. Alterations and additions were made to it in the 14th century, and again in the 15th century when the west tower was built. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 November 1987. Architecture=Exterior It is constructed in sandstone rubble and has a tiled roof. Its plan consists of a two-bay nave with a north porch, a chancel with a roof at a lower level than the nave, a vestry to the north of the chancel, and a west tower. The nave measures by , and the chancel by . The tower is in three stages. In its lowest stage are diagonal buttresses, and a two-light west window; in the stage above is a thin rectangular window. The upper stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side, and at the top is a parapet behind which is a pyramidal roof. The porch is timber-framed and the round-headed inner doorway is decorated with carvings, including chevrons. Also in the north wall of the nave is a two-light window under a pointed head. The south wall of the nave has two two- light windows between which is another round-headed doorway that is plain rather than decorated with carving. The south and east walls of the chancel each have a two-light window. Interior The nave and chancel ceilings are plastered. Above and to the left of the chancel arch are fragments of wall painting. In the chancel is a piscina with a triangular head. The communion rails dated from the 17th century and have turned balusters, and the pews contain linenfold panels. There are boards in the nave painted with the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. Under the tower are tiles with the Ten Commandments and the names of the churchwardens of 1851. The font dates from the 10th century; it is plain and simple, with a circular bowl on a circular base. The organ is a chamber organ of unknown date that was restored in 1978 by Nicholson & Co of Worcester. It is thought that Sir Edward Elgar may have played this organ. There is a ring of four bells. The oldest is dated 1686 by an unknown maker, there are two bells by Abel Rudhall, one cast in 1745 and 1753, and the fourth, originally of 1745 was recast in 1908 by H. Bond of Burford. The church plate includes a paten and flagon dated 1740, a bread knife with a silver handle of 1750, and a cup dated 1766.

It was established in 1916. Today, Weir High School is home to roughly 640 students in grades 9 through 12. It is a part of the Hancock County school district. The school has been named a school of excellence and a national blue ribbon school. Its curriculum is broad and consists of career clusters designed to help students determine a path of higher education. History The small village called Holliday's Cove‚Äîwhich is now most of downtown Weirton‚Äîwas founded in the late 18th century. In 1909, Ernest T. Weir built a steel mill later known as Weirton Steel Corporation just north of Hollidays Cove. The original Weir High School opened its doors in what is now known as downtown Weirton, WV, in 1916. At this time, however, the school was known as Central High School, for its students were from each of the unincorporated towns in the county. By then Hollidays Cove and two other outlying areas, Weirton Heights and Marland Heights surrounding the \\"Weir‚ÄìCove\\" area were growing at an astounding rate. In a 1937 article in Life magazine the town of Weirton is noted as being the largest unincorporated town in the United States, with a vibrant community developed by Ernest T. Weir, including a swimming pool, golf course, and football stadium for Weir High School. Weirton at its peak would consist of 28,201 citizens.

Caricature by Ape published in Vanity Fair in 1875. Guildford James Hillier Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow (29 March 1814 ‚Äì 20 August 1882) was an English Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1858 to 1874. Guildford Onslow was the second of five sons of Colonel Thomas Cranley Onslow whose father in turn was a wealthy late 18th century British Royal family friend and politician, Thomas Onslow, 2nd Earl of Onslow. His flamboyant name - Guildford is the county town of the county of Surrey and his family owned land and businesses in the county - was bolstered by the wealth of the father of his mother Susannah, Nathaniel Hillier, who owned the estate of Stoke Park House, Stoke-next-Guildford, Surrey. His father started a relatively briefly second-ranking branch of the Earl of Onslow's family, the land owning and land-developing heirs of much of the land of the Earls of Surrey which in 1870 became the senior branch of the family on the accession to the earldom of Guildford Onslow's nephew. He was educated at Eton College and joined his father's regiment, the Scots Fusilier Guards. He reached the rank of captain and also served in the 11th Regiment of Foot. He was a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1870 In October 1858, Onslow was elected at a by-election as one of the two Members of Parliament (MP) for Guildford in Surrey. He was returned at the next three general elections, holding the seat when Guildford's parliamentary representation was reduced to one seat at the 1868 general election, but at the 1874 general election he lost the seat to the Conservative Party candidate, his sixth cousin Denzil Roberts Onslow. In 1861 he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surnames of Mainwaring and Ellerker. Onslow died at the age of 68. Onslow married a cousin, Rosa Anne Onslow, daughter of General Denzil Onslow of Staughton House, Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire (since 1974 Cambridgeshire).

Although Japan was one of the first countries to implement an electronic waste recycling program, it is still having serious issues. In this day and age, e-waste disposal has become of major importance due to the increasing demand for electronics on a worldwide scale. In 2013, the Japanese government reported that roughly of e-waste was collected and treated in Japan, which only equates to about 24-30% of total e-waste. Not only does e-waste harm the environment if untreated, it also becomes a fiscal loss due to the material lost that could have been salvaged. Much of Japan's e-waste is actually exported to neighboring countries. By developing new recycling initiatives, Japan can turn trash into treasure and help the environment at the same time. These recycling initiatives are important because handling e-waste is not an easy process, or a safe one. Over the years, Japan has been working to develop safe and efficient waste management programs to handle this e-waste. Despite these efforts, there have still been serious problems surrounding the environmental and health issues regarding e-waste in Japan.  E-waste processing = Sources of E-waste  Japan has quickly become one of the most wasteful nations in the world according to Basel Action Network's executive director Jim Puckett. As the country continues to progressively manufacture and consume more electronic goods, the e-waste generated from these goods grows as well. Japan ranks as the third most wasteful country in the world by volume behind the United States and China. Wastes are broadly divided into three different categories that consist of industrials, non-industrials, and hazardous. E-waste falls into the category of non-industrial wastes and is recognized as \\"electrical and electronic wastes,\\" or \\"bulky trash\\". Some e-waste sources include refrigerators, televisions, air conditioning units, and washing machines.  Treatment  The Association for Electric Home Appliances developed the home appliance recycling ticket system which is the foundation of e-waste recycling and treatment. This ticketing system was installed to ensure that relevant parties would forward smoother home appliance recycling activities under the Law for the Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances (LRHA). Although it is one system, it comes in two types. The first type requires consumers to pay recycling and transportation fees to the retailer and the second type requires them to pay recycling fees through postal transfer. The cost of transportation as well as the recycling of the e-waste when discarding home appliances is the responsibility of the consumer with recycling fees typically ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 yen. Manufactures are responsible for establishing their own recycling facilities. Although manufacturers are responsible for establishing recycling infrastructure for home appliances, the specific method is not regulated. Therefore, the responses can be divided into two vague groups: Group A and Group B. The two different methods help to enable competition and create new recycling processes by providing about 200 national collection sites with dissimilar viewpoints on reducing costs. In the broadest terms, Group A aims to keep cost down through maximum utilization of existing waste management companies, while Group B attempts to cut costs by adopting efficient logistics systems. Current legislation The foundation of Japanese e-waste recycling contains two elements; the first is the Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources (LPUR) and the other is the Law for the Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances (LRHA). The first law was most recently revised in 2001, called the Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources (LPUR). This law encourages manufacturers to voluntarily help recycle goods and reduce the generation of the waste. The second law became effective on April 1, 2009, called the Law for the Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances (LRHA). This law imposes more requirements on the recycling efforts of both consumers and manufacturers of home appliances. In October, 2003, taxes were imposed on any computer purchased after that date. If a computer was purchased before that date, those wanting to recycle their computer would pay a nominal fee to keep up with recycling costs.  Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources  LPUR was instituted in 2000 as a means to promote the reduction of waste generation, reuse of parts, and recycling. More specifically, it aims to establish a recycling-based economic system by reusing parts of collected products, strengthening collection methods, and introducing new measures to reduce wastes and extending product life span. These basic policies are formulated and publicized by relevant ministers, such as the minister of the businesses and the Minister of the Environment and are followed by parties involved with e-waste. These four parties concerned are businesses, consumers, the national government, and the local government. Businesses must rationalize the use of raw materials as well as use reusable parts and recyclable resources. Consumers are responsible for facilitating the use of these recyclables and using products for the entirety of their lifespan. The national government holds the most responsibility as they shall take care of proper funding for recycling and treatment, take necessary action to promote research and development, and encourage the public to do their research and recycle and reuse. The local government holds similar responsibilities as the national government, but on a smaller scale.  Law for the Recycling of Specified of Home Appliances  The Law for the Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances (LRHA) became effective in 2001 as a way to enforce rules on the production of products such as CRT television receivers, household air conditioners, washing machines, and refrigerators. More specifically, LRHA was created to create a recycling scheme in which the main principle is to newly impose obligations on home appliance manufactures and retailers. These manufacturers and retailers are pressured by this law to ensure proper waste treatment and efficient use of resources. LRHA outlines which kinds of home appliances are regulated, the responsibilities of the parties involved, whom include waste generators, retailers, manufacturers, the Association for Electric Home Appliances, and city governments, as well as the standards for recycling and regulating the coupon system. Waste generators, which include business operators and consumers, must transfer necessary appliances to retailers and pay necessary recycling and collection fee demanded by the retailers. Retailers must take back sold appliances, deliver home appliances, and issue recycling coupons. Manufactures and importers are responsible for to take back manufactured appliances from retailers, recycle appliances, and make recycling fees public. The Association for Electric Home Appliances must recycle appliances in which the manufacturer is unknown as well as appliances entrusted by specific manufactures whose production volume is less than 900,000 units for television sets and air conditioners and 450,000 units for washing machines and refrigerators. Governments are responsible for promoting the collection, transportation, and recycling of used home appliances. LRHA is also responsible for setting recycling standards. All home appliances that are taken back must meet minimum recycling rate requirements. In regards to the LRHA law, recycling rate refers to the weight of materials recycled divided by the weight of units processed for recycling. The minimum required recycling rates are 70% for air conditioners, 55% for televisions, 60% for refrigerators and freezers, and 65% for washing machines. The home appliance recycling coupon system ensures that the listed home appliances are transferred from retailers to manufactures in an appropriate manner. This allows for consumers and businesses to check whether recycling is performed properly or not. Recycling process The utilization of electronic waste resources is around 50% currently and is growing. The LRHA states that consumers are responsible for the cost of recycling most home appliances. This includes transportation costs and recycling fees. The consumers pay the retailers to pick up the waste. They then recycle it and the consumers pay the related fees. In order to make the system more balanced, if a consumer asks a retailer to take the used home appliance for any reason (most likely because they purchased a new appliance), the retailer is obligated to pick it up. The retailers usually take it back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer is required to have a system in place to recycle the electronic waste, and this system must also maintain a certain percentage of utilization from these resources. Part of this process is not regulated by the government, and that is the process of acquiring a recycling facility and/or how the recycling is currently done. Manufacturers can hire anyone they want to build the facility and they can also recycle electronic waste in any way they deem fit. The only thing it must maintain is the amount of utilization from each material that comes into the facility. The manufacturers often want to recycle the products in the cheapest way possible and this leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Future use and alternatives  Today, Japan has one of the highest recycling rates in all of Asia, but these numbers are more closely related to the recycling of plastics, paper, and glass. Of the 650,000 tons of home appliances and small electronics discarded per year, less than 100,000 tons are actually collected for recycling. With this, new ideas and initiatives have been developed to counteract this huge gap. With the Olympics heading to Japan in 2020, there have been strong suggestions towards using e-waste in the gold medals. Although the IOC requires that each medal contain at least six grams of gold, Japan's Olympic organizing committee believes that the idea is a feasible one.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The buildings are in a section of downtown with several historic structures. Across Ripley Street to the west is the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Freight House, and to the east across Harrison Street is the Dillon Memorial. On River Drive northwest from the Burlington Freight House is The Linograph Company Building. Across Beiderbecke Drive to the south are the W.D. Petersen Memorial Music Pavilion and the Mississippi River. History Union Station Rail service through Davenport was being discussed and planned to start in 1842. Up to this point, however, the Mississippi River had never been crossed by a bridge anywhere. That was accomplished by 1856 when the first railroad bridge was built between Davenport and Rock Island, Illinois, and the city's rail history began. By 1895 several rail lines already passed through Davenport when Frank Blair organized the Davenport, Rock Island and North Western Railway (DRI & NW). In five years the company completed its route to Clinton, Iowa and the Crescent Bridge (1899) across the Mississippi between Davenport and Rock Island. The bridge is downstream from the site of the first railroad bridge that crossed the river. In 1901, the DRI & NW was purchased by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CBQ). The Milwaukee Road already operated in Davenport while the CBQ did not, this purchase brought it operations to the city. The three railroads each had a station in Davenport and in 1916 plans were made to build a union station on the riverfront. with They were revised in 1923 and the following year the DRI & NW and its parent companies built Union Station on the levee grounds. After World War II passenger service started to fade until it was discontinued in the 1950s. The building eventually became a Trailways bus station. The main floor of the station has as a visitor's center from the 1990s to 2017. The upper floors and the freight house are office space. A $450,000 renovation of the facility was completed in 2009. It is the only passenger train station remaining in Davenport. Architecture Burlington Freight House Union Station and the Burlington Freight House are two separate buildings that are joined by a wood post and beam shelter. The station has twin facades. The rail side faces south and the north side faces a parking lot on River Drive. Similarly, the freight house was built with docks on the north and south sides of the building in order to facilitate the transfer of cargo. The station is a two-story, Georgian Revival, tan brick building. It is built on a concrete foundation. The building features a stylized Greek temple front on the north and south elevations, which emphasizes the building's entrances. The temple features four columns that are attached to the building with tapered, square shafts and stylized capitals. The columns support a Classical entablature that includes dentils, round medallions, and stepped fascia. A heavy cornice crowns the perimeter of the building. The building features rectangular windows on both floors, but the first-floor windows are framed with arches. Keystones made of concrete highlight the windows. Deep awnings are above the primary entrances. The Burlington Freight House is a single- story building that is constructed with the same materials as Union Station. As mentioned above the building featured docks, with oversized doors on both the north and the south sides of the building. The south dock, however, has been removed to accommodate an access ramp. The architectural style is the same as that of the station. The decorative details on the freight house are limited to a horizontal band of concrete at the cornice level and concrete window sills.

Most of the Kuteb live in Taraba State, Nigeria. Recently they have been involved in violent confrontations with other ethnic groups in which many people have been killed or forced to move. Background According to tradition the Kuteb migrated from Egypt about 1000 AD, eventually reaching their present location around 1510. The Kuteb people are made of the following clans which is believed to be Children of Kuteb; Lumbu, Ticwo, Rufu, Askaen, Bika (Zwika), Ticwo, Rubur, Tswaen, Acha, Likam, Cwumam, and the Rucwu. Traditionally they engaged in farming, hunting and fishing in the fertile lands of the Benue River basin. The people worshiped family idols, but also believed in a supreme being who created the world and brings health, rain and the harvest. They were ruled by a paramount priest king, the Kwe Kukwen, selected by a council of elders representing the different Kuteb clans. A 2007 report estimated the number of Kuteb people as approximately 100,000. Most live in what is now Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State, Nigeria, although there are a few Kuteb villages in Cameroon. Under the British, who took control around 1900, the Kuteb were subject to the first-class Jukun ruler, or \\"Aku Uka\\" of the Wukari Federation. In 1914, the British made the Kwe Kukwen the only graded and third class chief in the Takum part of the confederation, with the title of Kwe Takum. He was made paramount over other peoples in the area. This change was resented by other ethnic groups of Hausa, Tiv, Chamba, Kukuns and Ichen, who forced the Ukwe Ahmadu Genkwe to leave Takum and reside elsewhere. The last Ukwe Takum was Ali Ibrahim, ruling from 1963 to 1996. Festus Ephraim Senior (2017)\\"The Kuteb of southern Taraba\\". Retrieved 2017-23-07. Politics The earliest direction for every activity in Kuteb land revolve round the theocratic role of the Kwe Kukwen, Akwen and Council of elders called Ndufu who represent the major known sub clans and extended families. Kukwen is the Chief-Priest located in Mbarikam, Ikam or Teekum and the Akwen are the minor priests who are heads of the other clans. This practice started with Kuteb himself as the paramount chief priest / King of the Kutebs. The Kwe Kukwen may be chosen from any clan. However, he must, on his election, come to reside in Teekum (Mbarikam Hill) being the ward of Likam and the Headquarters of the Kuteb Nation. The traditional Kuteb political system is thus federal in nature. Even though the Kutebs recognised the seniority of Likam, the other clans had some autonomy to exercise powers of maintaining peace, protecting and achieving the interest of their respective clan members. However, such power ended where collective interest and programmes of the entire nation was to begin and where the settlement of disputes between individuals and clans were brought before the Kwe Kukwen. In addition to the political role the Kukwen and Akwen have a spiritual role, responsibility and authority. The roles are rooted in the religious belief of the Kutebs. Chieftaincy stool issue In the 1970s Takum was part of the old Benue Plateau State. The local government gazette recognized three main chieftaincy stools in the Wukari Federation for the Wukari, Donga and Takum local government areas, each to be elected by their indigenous people. This law was changed by the governor Joseph Gomwalk in 1975, withdrawing the sole right of the Kuteb to select the holder of the Ukwe Chieftaincy stool of Takum from one of their two royal families. The new law allowed for election of a Chamba chief, while making a Jukun man chairman of the selection committee and altering the composition of the committee to include Jukun and Chamba as well as Hausa and Kuteb. The justification was the changing demographics of Takum, but the result was disturbances that caused the government to ban the traditional annual Kuchichebe festival, when the land is blessed to ensure the next harvest will be fertile. Later, similar festivals were banned in other Wukari Federation areas due to the trouble they caused. In October 1997 the Taraba State military administrator Amen Edore Oyakhire sent a paper called Comprehensive brief on the Chieftaincy Stool of Takum Chiefdom Taraba State to the Armed Forces Ruling Council. That month seven people were killed and seven houses razed in communal violence, and 31 people were arrested. Oyakhire said anyone suspected of involvement in the communal violence would be treated as detractors of the transition to civil rule. In 1998 the Taraba State Government also set up a Peace Committee which managed to negotiate a truce between the ethnic groups. Ongoing conflict The Kuteb have been involved in ongoing violent conflicts with their neighbors. An ethnic crisis between the Jukun and Kuteb broke out in 1991. On 27 December 2008 another crisis erupted in Takum over an alleged killing of a Jukun youth by Kuteb youths. Perhaps 20 people died and thousands took refuge in the local military barracks. In 2000 there was fighting between the Jukun/Chamba and Tiv people, with over 250 villages burned. In 2006 violent clashes again began between the Kuteb and the Tiv, in which many people lost their lives. In a December 2008 press conference the Taraba State Governor, Danbaba Suntai, said he could see no end to the conflict.

Pasdar has been credited for being one of the leading innovators of Cloud Delivered Security via two technology startups he founded. IGX Global in 1997 and Bat Blue Networks (Now OPAQ Networks) in 2007, in both cases serving as CEO and CTO. Pasdar exited Bat Blue Networks in 2016 with the sale of his company to OPAQ Networks. He is now serving as founder, CEO and CTO of Acreto IoT Security, focused on addressing emerging security challenges posed by highly distributed and mobile purpose-built internet of things (IoT) devices that have seeped into every day life. Pasdar was selected as one of New York's Top Ten Startup Founders in 2017. Early years Pasdar the eldest of three sons was born in Kermanshah, Iran. His father was Koocheck Pasdar, a General in the Iranian Army under the Shah of Iran. His mother Simin Fardsavar-Pasdar was a school teacher from Shiraz, Iran. Pasdar is also related to actor Adrian Pasdar. His family fled Iran to the United States in 1979 to escape the revolution. Arriving to the U.S. under a tourist visa, his family's requests for political asylum were denied, driving a long process for the family to establish themselves legally and financially in the United States.  Professional career  Pasdar was an early entrepreneur, starting his first business while still in high school. At a time when computer memory chips were in significant demand with high prices, Pasdar purchased used mainframe computers at auctions and extracted their memory chips using special techniques he developed. Throughout his career he has been credited for evolving ahead of a constantly commoditizing technology market-space moving from harvesting memory chips, to building PCs, networking, multi-platform integration, Internet communications and eventually cyber security. In 1992, Pasdar discovered the Internet and quickly moved to start his first Internet Services Company where he developed experience and expertise in Internet Communications technologies. In 1995 while experimenting with unorthodox Internet communications, Pasdar inadvertently compromised the Microsoft corporation. This highlighted to Pasdar the importance of cyber security and how challenged the industry's approach was. In 1997, Pasdar founded IGX Global, a cyber security company delivering fully operationalized Security as- a-Service. He developed a reputation for effective handling of large-scale and complex projects. This reputation drove Juniper Networks to engage Pasdar in the Verizon Wireless project which led to his whistleblowing on Verizon's warrant-less wiretapping. At IGX Global, Pasdar also invented the first Proxy in-the-Cloud technology called Security Anywhere. This Proxy in-the-Cloud approach became the foundations of many early cloud security technology companies. In 2007, Pasdar exited IGX Global and formed Bat Blue Networks with a focus on furthering his works around Cloud Delivered Security. At Bat Blue he developed and brought to market the Cloud/SEC platform. Cloud/SEC represented the first platform to deliver full-stack security supporting every port, protocol and application from-the-Cloud. The virtues of the platform were highlighted in Pasdar's 2016 book Unified Cloud Security: The CXO Guide to Building Effective, Agile and Sustainable Security. In 2016 Pasdar exited Bat Blue Networks with the sale of the company to OPAQ Networks.  Warrant- less Wiretapping Whistleblower  In 2003, Pasdar was engaged by Juniper Networks to re-architect and scale the network and security infrastructure for Verizon Wireless. During the roll-out process Pasdar was made aware of \\"The Quantico Circuit\\" that provided a third-party (believed to be the U.S. FBI) unfettered access to all data and voice communications of the carriers' customers. Pasdar's efforts to implement any type of control or logging for the communications to the third-party were met with resistance and subsequent threats from the carriers' management. Eventually Pasdar blew the Whistle on Verizon Wireless. His public testimony was used to file a $233 billion class- action lawsuit against Verizon Wireless and other carriers alleged to have participated in an illegal warrant-less wiretapping effort by the U.S. Government. Pasdar testified to Congressional Committees including the House Committee on Energy & Commerce, the Subcommittee on Telecommunications & the Internet and the Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations. He also testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee. His testimony led to a Dear Colleague Letter from congressmen Dingell, Markey and Stupak. Pasdar's detailed testimony was considered damning, and in light of the massive $233 billion lawsuit, the Telecommunications Industry lobbied Congress for retroactive immunity. The Immunity Bill H.R. 6304 was passed by the 110th Congress on July 9, 2008.

In fact, since the fourteenth century at least, local historians of the region have seen its history in terms of a succession of empires. This cycle is discernible in the historical accounts of shaykh Uthman, whose history was told to the historian ibn Khaldun while on the Muslim Pilgrimage in 1397. It can also be found in the great Sudanese chronicle, Tarikh al-Fettash.

History McDaniel, formerly known as Western Maryland, football dates back to 1891 when the first game was played against northern rival Gettysburg College.http://mcdanielathletics.com/sports/fball/history/yby- stats/histresu.htm The Green Terror would become a power house in college football from 1925 to 1934. During this decade the Terror Squad had 3 undefeated seasons, despite only having around 500 students. The Green Terror were nationally ranked and were commonly beating schools such as Boston College & Bucknell University, 40-0. Other impressive victories included, beating University of Maryland College Park 39-7, Georgetown University 20-0, and Temple University, 23-0.McDaniel Football Records - All-time Game Results - McDaniel College Many of these victories were played in front of +20,000 crowds at Baltimore Memorial Stadium. Such was the case in 1927 when they won the MacArthur Cup handed out by General Douglas MacArthur, when The Terror beat an all-army team made up of the best players from all the regional army bases, 48-0. In 1934, during the Great Depression, Western Maryland was invited to play in the first Orange Bowl. Coach Dick Harlow declined so that his best player, Bill Shepherd, could play in the then more prestigious East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game, which hosted over 55,000 fans. Shepherd was the MVP of the game, playing 59 of 60 minutes as his East team lost. In the initial Orange Bowl (which only 5,000 attendedBucknell Wins Game At Miami,\\" Charleston (WV) Daily Mail, Jan. 2, 1935, p8) Bucknell, shut out earlier in the season by the Terror, defeated the Miami Hurricanes 26-0. In 1947 The Green Terror football team was featured in a cartoon in the New Yorker before a Western Maryland ‚Äì Harvard Crimson game. Soon after World War II, WMC decided to play only other small colleges described as the college's natural rivals. It was then that McDaniel's archrivalry (its old one being College Park), began with Johns Hopkins. The McDaniel-Hopkins rivalry game has annually been the last game of the regular season since 1947 and played over 90 times since their first meeting in 1894. Since 2009 it has become a trophy game known as the Maryland Railroad Lantern game. Another historic moment was in 1992 when McDaniel became the first college football team to play in Russia. Against an all-Europe team The Terror won 47-4. In the 1990s and 2000s the Terror would go on to be nationally ranked, going 58-7, and have great players such as running back Eric Frees who would go on to set the then NCAA D3 rushing record in 1992.

He never worked for any of the major manufacturers but maintained a productive relationship with BSA in its heyday. After the demise of BSA in 1972, Cheney joined with former BSA factory rider John Banks to develop and ride successful BSA powered motocross bikes. His company was originally known as Eric Cheney Designs, then changed to Inter-Moto and is now known as Cheney Racing. Eric handed on his ideas to his son Simon Cheney, who is also an experienced competition rider. Each of the hand built motorcycles takes over 400 man hours to complete. Cheney ISDT Team In the late 1960s the British motorcycle industry was unable to support a national ISDT team so Eric Cheney hand built a limited number of ISDT Cheney-Triumphs, using his own design of twin down- tube frame with a specially tuned Triumph 5TA engine. Fitted with tapered conical hubs, special motocross forks and large alloy fuel tanks, a Cheney Triumph was first used in the 1968 British Trophy Team. In 1970 and 1971 three 504cc Cheney Triumphs were used by the British team in the International Six Days Trial (ISDT). Replicas were built, but production was short-lived due to a shortage of engines Model range Although each Cheney motorcycle is different, many are based on the BSA C15 250 cc engine or the larger 500 cc unit version. The company also manufacture black powder-coated frame kits for BSA C15, B25, B40, B44 and B50 engines, as well as nickel-plated frame kits for Triumph 500 cc or 350 cc unit engines.

It lived about 125 million years ago in the earliest Aptian. Discovery and naming It was named by Wu Wen-hao, Pascal Godefroit and Hu Dong-yu in 2010 and the type species is Bolong yixianensis. The genus name is derived from the names of the brothers Bo Hai-chen and Bo Xue, who helped uncover it, and the Mandarin word Èæç l√≥ng \\"dragon\\". The specific name refers to the Yixian Formation which is where is Liaoning it was found. The holotype fossil, YHZ-001, consists of a skull with lower jaws from which a middle portion is missing. The fossil was highly compressed. In 2013 a second specimen was described, ZMNH-M8812, consisting of an almost complete skeleton of a very young animal. It was found by a farmer in the village of Xitaizhi. Description Bolong was a relatively small animal with an estimated length of four meters and a weight of 200 kilograms. The head is convex and fairly stocky with powerful mandibles. The teeth are relatively large. Different autapomorphies (unique derived traits) that can be established are: a cavity at the interface of the lacrimal bone, the maxilla, the backwards branch of the prefrontal bone, consisting of a front-to-rear depth cavity above the edges of the eye socket, the lower protrusion of the predentarium extending rearwardly parallel to the lower edge, the interface of the predentarium that occupies less than two-thirds of the height of the dentarium so that the front tip of the dentarium protrudes a third above the predentarium, and that the teeth in the maxilla have dental crowns of which the main ridge bends at the tip of the tooth. The second specimen showed a different autapomorphy: the inside of the maxillary teeth are thickened and enclosed from the front and rear cutting edges and is divided in half by a striking vertical ledge. Phylogeny The describers placed Bolong in Hadrosauroidea. It would have been one of the most basal hadrosauroids found in Asia.

A 13-year-old boy, Jos√© Luis S√°nchez (Mauricio Kuri), witnesses the killing. Driven by love for his Faith and anger against the injustices committed against Fr.

Their battle cry is \\"¬°Viva Cristo Rey!\\" (\\"Long live Christ the King\\"). The rebel leader, retired General Enrique Gorostieta (Andy Garc√≠a), an agnostic, takes an interest in young Jos√©, who soon becomes his prot√©g√©. While fighting against the Federales, Jos√© is later captured in a firefight and tortured to force him to renounce his belief in God. When he resolutely defends his faith, he is executed. The next year, Gorostieta is killed in a battle at Jalisco after he becomes a Catholic. In 1929, however, agreements were made to restore religious freedoms. Pope Benedict XVI beatified Jos√© in 2005, along with 12 other martyrs of the religious persecution.

The film is based on The Cristero Rebellion, the 1976 chronicle of the war written by French historian Jean Meyer who resides in Mexico. Filming started in May 2010 and shot for 12 weeks. Production took place between 31 May 2010 and 16 August 2010. The film was shot in Mexico City, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potos√≠, Tlaxcala and Puebla. Including an ecological reserve, Sierra de √ìrganos National Park in the town of Sombrerete, Mexico.https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Sierra%20de%20Organos,%20Sombrerete,%20Zacatecas,%20Mexico At one point the director recreates a famous photograph of the bodies of executed Cristeros hanging from telephone poles, but they are seen in the film from a moving train. Release The film had a robust opening in Mexico taking first place in gross admissions at the box office, and second in total receipts, behind Titanic 3D. As of May 11, 2012, it had grossed $2.2 million. Reception The film has received mixed reviews. As of 2012 it holds a 35% rating on Metacritic based on 17 critics, and a 21% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews. The latter site states: \\"It has laudable aspirations, but For Greater Glory ultimately fails to fulfill its goals due to an overstuffed script, thinly written characters, and an overly simplified dramatization of historical events.\\" Roger Ebert concluded that \\"it is well-made, yes, but has such pro-Catholic tunnel vision I began to question its view of events.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the film as an \\"old-fashioned, Hollywood-style epic\\" and said that it compared favorably to Christian mega- hits of the 1950s such as The Robe. He was most satisfied with Dean Wright, referring to his direction as \\"impressively spacious.\\" The composer James Horner also scored high marks for his score, which Holden found \\"uplifting without being syrupy\\" and which set an \\"inspirational mood.\\" Phil Boatwright of the \\"Baptist Press\\" called the film \\"a compelling, thoughtful homage to religious freedom\\" and said that it brought back memories of El Cid and A Man for All Seasons. According to Steven D. Greydanus, For Greater Glory may help to change the obscurity of the Cristero War in the United States. He observed that the film is \\"one of the most lavish and ambitious films ever produced in Mexico\\" and \\"a sweeping, handsome epic with strong performances, solid production values and magnificent locations across Mexico.\\" However, he found the screenplay overbearing and would have liked to have seen more character development.

Biography  Adrian Rollinson was born in 1965 in Dudley. He came to prominence in strongman circles relatively late when he made the finals of Britain's Strongest Man in 1999, though he did not earn a place on the podium. In 2000 he won a Geoff Capes UK Strongest Man heat to qualify for the UK's Strongest Man 2000 show. For a long while, the top five placed athletes from Britain's Strongest Man qualified for the finals of the World's Strongest Man and Rollinson found himself thrown in with the world's best in 2000 at the finals in South Africa. He appeared three more times in the WSM, after strong finishes in Britain's Strongest Man (\\"BSM\\"). In 2004 he came second in the BSM but ironically came closer to the title in 2005, at which he finished third. In this 2005 BSM, the title was decided by the three top scoring competitors racing in a Farmer's Walk event. Rollinson had dominated the entire competition prior to that, being the only man to complete the Atlas Stones and having pressed 9 reps on the log press. However, for the top three, prior points were discarded in favour of the Farmer's Walk . Mick Gosling won the event and Rollinson, not known for his speed, came third. This would prove to be his final BSM. In addition to these major competitions, Rollinson also took second spot in the Iceland's Strongest Man tournament as a guest. After his retirement he remains active as a promoter of tournaments, notably the nationally renowned \\"Mighty Midlander\\" contest. Outside of strongman, Rollinson worked as a roadworker in his native Dudley. He landed a role as a Gyptian bodyguard in 2007 in the movie, The Golden Compass, the Hollywood adaptation of the first in Philip Pullman's trilogy, His Dark Materials. He filmed five scenes in London just before Christmas 2007 but did not meet the principle stars Daniel Craig or Nicole Kidman. He did film with Eva Green, Tom Courtenay and Jim Carter.Express and Star, Roadworker Ade joins A-list References External links  *Adrian Rollinson - Official site Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:English strength athletes Category:British strength athletes Category:People from Dudley ","title":"Adrian Rollinson"},{"id":"29101500","text":"The Bailey's Hotel, is a historic hotel in the Kensington district of London. The postal address is 140 Gloucester Road, but the main entrance is on Courtfield Road, opposite Gloucester Road tube station. It was established in 1876 and named after its original owner, Sir James Bailey (1840-1910), Member of Parliament. History Bailey's Hotel was one of the earliest privately built hotels in London, built between 1874 and 1876 by Aldin and Sons under the command of MP Sir James Bailey. He erected the hotel in an upmarket location so as to attract London‚Äôs aristocracy and wealthier inhabitants and to be easily accessible through Gloucester Road tube station. When completed the hotel also included nine stables to host a carriage service from the hotel. In 1877 Bailey extended Bailey‚Äôs Hotel along Courtfield Road and in 1881 replaced the stables with a garden and additional buildings, which today houses the Bombay Brasserie restaurant. In 1883 Bailey installed new bedrooms and built a new elevator and installed electric lights in 1890. Abu Bakar of Johor spent his last days at Bailey's Hotel before dying of pneumonia on 4 June 1895. By the 1890s Bailey's Hotel was one of the more successful hotels in London with over 300 rooms, and was popular with international guests. An American tourist guide published in 1891 mentioned the \\"cosy, homelike atmosphere, which is enhanced by the rich and substantial surroundings\\" (all for $1 a night at the time). Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor spent his last days in bed at the hotel before dying of pneumonia on 4 June 1895. At the peak of its success, Bailey sold the hotel to Spiers & Pond Limited in 1894, but remained as Managing Director for several years, as he was elected a Member of Parliament for Walworth, Newington, and was knighted in 1905. By 1914 Bailey's Hotel faced stiff competition, with some fourteen hotels in eighteen buildings in close proximity. It survived, though, and during World War II was hit by an incendiary bomb, causing a major fire and damage, and again on 8 March 1941. A further fire broke out in the staff quarters in 1945, damaging the ceilings and floorboards, which meant the building had to be evacuated at a time when it was being used as a provisional hospital. It wasn't until 1952-54 that the hotel was renovated, and new bathrooms were added in 1954 and a new bar in 1958. However, the hotel had significantly fallen from grace and was not the elegant, upmarket hotel it had been, and it changed ownership many times. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea protected the hotel from being demolished in the 1970s and 1980s because of its historical value. In the 1970s a room in the hotel cost just $12 a night, compared to $110 today. The hotel was completely restored in 1988 and purchased from the Taj Group by Securum Hotel Holdings in 1992, and by City Developments Limited (CDL) in July 1994. It is now operated by Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. Architecture=Exterior The building retains its elegant Victorian appearance. The name of the hotel, Bailey's Hotel, is written in gold lettering above a central porch. Above the name are five royal flags of Great Britain. Interior In 1996 it underwent renovation but today the hotel retains many of its Victorian furnishings, including the period fireplaces and grand, spiralling main staircase. The hotel is 5 floors in height and contains 212 rooms. The main restaurant is the Bombay Brasserie, which serves Indian cuisine typical of the British Raj and Olive's Restaurant, a stylish Victorian restaurant that serves continental and full English breakfasts. The main bar is called Olives Bar.

The sport was dropped in 1917 and 1918 during U.S. involvement in World War I, but returned after the war. Until 1924, the Mercer Bears were known as the Mercer Baptists. After the 1941 season, with the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, Mercer dropped football again, but did not resume the sport after the war. The program was reinstated after a 72-year hiatus in 2013; the first game was on August 31, 2013, when Mercer defeated (40‚Äì37) Reinhardt University in front of an overflow crowd of 12,172 at the Moye Complex.

The oldest known building in the Palace District, it was rebuilt in 1945 after being destroyed in World War II - and then was damaged badly again in 1956. The Szent R√≥kus K√≥rh√°z (St Roch Hospital) next door - was opened in 1796, but in its current incarnation offers few clues to its antiquity. A major impetus for the area's development after the great flood was the construction at its western end of the magnificent neo-classical Hungarian National Museum between 1837 and 1847, designed by the Viennese-born architect Mih√°ly Pollack, after whom the square behind the museum is named. Meetings of the upper house of the Hungarian parliament, established as part of the compromise which founded the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, were held in the National Museum until the opening of the new Hungarian parliament building in 1904. The rest of Hungary's original parliament was established next door to the museum at F≈ëherceg S√°ndor utca (Archduke Alexander Street) (today Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca) 8. This street was named in honour of Hungary's Habsburg Palatine, or Viceroy, during the years 1790-95, Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria, in 1840. The building, completed in 1866, was designed by one of 19th century Budapest's great architects, Mikl√≥s Ybl, who also designed the Opera House and the Basilica, as well as five of the Palotanegyed's palaces (Festetics, P√°lffy, K√°rolyi (on Pollack Mih√°ly t√©r), B√≥kay and Odescalchi/Degenfeld-Schomburg). Today the old parliament building houses the Italian Cultural Institute. Between 1860 and the outbreak of the First World War, members of the dual monarchy's aristocratic and mercantile elite - many of whom were members of parliament - built around 36 city palaces or mansions in the same area.R√°cz Attila ed, Palotanegyed Most, Jelen, J√∂v√∂, J√≥zsefv√°ros √ñnkorm√°nyzat, 2012 The K√°rolyi family built four palaces in the district, Count J√°nos Zichy and his family three, while the B√°nffy and Wenckheim families each built two. The district's palaces were mostly constructed in the streets surrounding the Museum (today's Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca, Pollack Mih√°ly t√©r, Muzeum utca, Reviczky utca and √ñtpacsirta utca. But a number were also built further east, including on today's L≈ërinc pap t√©r, Gyulai P√°l utca, Hor√°nszky utca, Szentkir√°lyi utca and Trefort utca. The other residential buildings constructed in the Palace District around the same time were designed mainly for middle or upper-middle class occupants.See, for example, the descriptions of J√≥zsef k√∂r√∫t 37-39 and Kr√∫dy Gyula utca 12 in Lajos Csord√°s, Walks Along the Great Boulevard, Budapest, Vince Books, 2008, pp. 166 and 170 The term 'palota' ('palace') is used more elastically in Hungary (and in much of Continental Europe) than in the English-speaking world. In the Palotanegyed it refers to everything from genuine palaces (such as the Wenckeim Palace, now Szab√≥ Ervin Library) for aristocratic families, to buildings with generously-proportioned apartments for the wealthy upper-middle classes (such as the Emich Palace on Hor√°nszky utca). The Palace District is also notable for one of Budapest‚Äôs two surviving buildings designed by the famous Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer, the Istv√°n K√°rolyi or K√°rolyi-Csekonics palace at M√∫zeum utca 17. (The other is the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z on the Szent Istv√°n k√∂r√∫t). One of the great classical architects of Pest, J√≥zsef Hild, designed one of the earlier buildings in the district, the 1842 Vir√°gf√ºz√©res h√°z (‚ÄòGarland House‚Äô) at Baross utca 40. At the time of writing it was dilapidated and set to be unsympathetically renovated with a large roof extension. Most of the Palotanegyed‚Äôs architecture echoes that of the Viennese Franz-Joseph era from the 1840s until World War One. However there are also a number of buildings in the Hungarian Secession style, championed most famously by √ñd√∂n Lechner, notably the Gutenberg Otthon and several buildings on Vas utca, Baross utca and Kr√∫dy utca. Lechner‚Äôs Jewish student B√©la Lajta‚Äôs designed the 1912 Count Sz√©chenyi School of Trade on Vas utca, a striking contrast to most of the Palace District‚Äôs architecture, fusing modernism, art deco and folk motifs. Its rich interior decoration, remarkably, survived World War II. One of the lesser-known architects who designed buildings in the Palotanegyed's pre-World War One boom period was another Jewish architect, Adolf Greiner (born Losoncz, now Slovakia, 1847, died Budapest 1931). He designed the √öjpest synagogue, built 1885-86, and a number of inner Pest apartment buildings in the 1890s, including the four-storey building at Hor√°nszky utca 27, built in 1892. The Palace District contains important educational and cultural institutions. Between the Muz√©um k√∂r√∫t and Puskin utca is the Humanities Faculty of Budapest‚Äôs E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, built 1880-3 by Imre Steindl, also the architect of the Parliament building.Annabel Barber, Budapest, Blue Guide, 2018, p.228 The central administration and many of the departments of the city‚Äôs Semmelweis University (of medicine) occupy the block between √úll√∂i √∫t, Baross utca, Maria utca and Szentk√≠r√°lyi utca. They had appeared on maps by 1896 and are of a similar style to the nearby E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University buildings. In addition, the Semmelweis University‚Äôs Faculty of Health Sciences and the Hungarian Society of Therapists are housed in the former sanatorium and medicinal baths at Vas utca 17 (see photo). The P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University occupies two buildings on Szentk√≠r√°ly utca, while the German- language Andr√°ssy University is housed in the Festetics Palace. The Arts and Humanities Faculty of the K√°roli G√°sp√°r University of the Reformed Church of Hungary is at Revitczky utca 4 and plans to expand ts presence in the Palotanegyed, into the former K√°rolyi palaces between Reviczky utca and Muz√©um utca once their current redevelopment has been completed. Schools in the district include the Sz√©chenyi School of Trade on Vas utca, the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University Trefort √Ågoston teacher-practicing High School on Trefort utca, and three on Hor√°nszky utca - the Benda K√°lm√°n Arts and Social Sciences College (part of the K√°roli G√°sp√°r University); the V√∂r√∂smarty Mih√°ly Gimn√°zium the Saint Ignatius Jesuit College. The main church in the district is the mainly neo-Romanesque J√©zus Sz√≠ve templom (Church of the Sacred Heart), on L√∂rincz Pap t√©r, which was built 1880-1890 to the designs of J√≥zsef Kauser.Barber, Op.Cit., p.238 Kauser also completed the spectacular interior of the Basilica after Mikl√≥s Ybl died in 1891Barber, Ibid., p.155 and designed the south- eastern quarter of the K√≥d√°ly k√∂r√∂nd, the magnificent quartet of residential palaces on Andr√°ssy √∫t between Oktogon and Heroes‚Äô Square.Barber, Ibid., p.201 The area around the J√©zus Sz√≠ve templom has long been known as the ‚Äòlittle Vatican‚Äô for its numerous institutions connected with the Catholic Church. These include the J√©zus Sz√≠ve Jezsuita l√©lkeszs√©g (the Society of Jesus Convent) at Maria utca 25, the Koll√©gium Ter√©zi√°num of the Miasszonyunkr√≥l Nevezett Kalocsai Iskolan√∂v√©rek T√°rsulata (Terezianum College (student dormitory) of the Society of Our Lady Sisters of Kalocsa School at Maria utca 20 and several in Hor√°nszky utca: the Saint Ignatius Jesuit College mentioned above (18); the Divine Saviour‚Äôs Sisters Saint Anna College (Isteni Megv√°lt√≥r√≥l Nevezett N≈ëv√©rek Szent Anna Coll√©giuma)(17); the 1912 P√°rbesz√©dh√°za, the House of Dialogue, the Jesuits' spiritual and cultural centre in Budapest(20) (handed after the communist regime‚Äôs dissolution of the Jesuit order to the Karl Marx University; ‚Äòthe ruined building was returned to the Jesuit order and the order had the building renovated by its hundredth anniversary‚Äô); and the J√©zus Sz√≠ve t√°rsas√°ga egyetemi szakkkolegium√° (during World War II the J√©zus Szive N√©pleanyok T√°rsas√°ga (Sacred Heart Society of Folkgirls) was at this address) (14). These institutions played a heroic role in helping persecuted Jews after the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944. The sisters of the Saint Anna College gave refuge to Jewish girls while the Sacred Heart Society of Folkgirls issued protective documents. The convent in Maria utca hid Jewish men,Kinga Frojimovic et al, Jewish Budapest, CEU Press, Budapest, 1999, pp.418 while the House of Dialogue, according to the plaque outside, ‚Äòhid almost forty deserters and 120 Jews away in the basement and then helped them escape abroad.‚Äô The 1877 Rabbinical Seminary and Budapest University of Jewish Studies on Gutenberg t√©r (Orsz√°gos Rabbik√©pz≈ë - Zsid√≥ Egyetem and Alap√≠tv√°ny a Zsid√≥ Egyetem√©rt) is the world‚Äôs oldest institution where rabbis graduate. It also contains a synagogue.Frojimovic et al, ibid., pp.202-3 Its construction was financed by the Emperor and King Franz Joseph, and was originally named after him. (He visited it a month after its opening in November 1877). After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the rabbinical institute was seized by the SS and turned into a prison. Adolf Eichmann used it as a base to organise the deportation of Hungarian Jews, mainly to Auschwitz. According to the Wikipedia article on the institute, an important part of its library was seized by the Nazis. ‚Äò3000 books were dispatched to Prague, where Eichmann planned the construction of a \\"Museum of an extinct race\\" in the former Jewish quarter. Only in the 1980s were the books discovered in the cellar of the Jewish Museum of Prague and brought back to Budapest in 1989. ‚ÄòThe library remains a source of pride for the university. It is considered one of the most important collections of Jewish theological literature outside Israel.‚Äô During the communist period, the rabbinical seminary in Budapest, uniquely in Eastern Europe, continued to operate, attracting students from across the region, including the Soviet Union. In addition to the main cultural institutions in the Palace District - the National Museum and the Szab√≥ Ervin Library - the Ur√°nia Cinema, at R√°k√≥czy √∫t 21, is also noteworthy. Designed by Henrik Schmahl in a hybrid Venetian Gothic-Moorish style, it opened in the mid-1890s initially as a cabaret theatre. Restored in 2002 to its original glory, four years later the Ur√°nia was awarded the European Union‚Äôs heritage protection prize, Europa Nostra, for outstanding restoration.

The damage was particularly bad around the Nagyk√∂r√∫t and K√°lvin t√©r. But while buildings on the former were reconstructed more or less to their original state, on K√°lvin t√©r many of the fine 19th century buildings on both sides of the square were demolished. More damage in both parts of the Palace District was inflicted during the 1956 uprising and the subsequent Soviet attack. The communist regime neglected the district's buildings and committed some great acts of vandalism, especially the demolition in 1965 of the city's National Theatre, until 1908 the N√©psz√≠nh√°z (People's Theatre - or Volkstheater) on Blaha Lujza t√©r. This building, much loved by Budapesters, had been constructed in 1875National Theatre (Budapest) to the designs of Fellner & Helmer. The loss of the National Theatre still seems to leave a gap on Blaha Lujza t√©r. A street on the eastern side of the J√≥zsef k√∂r√∫t which led to the N√©psz√≠nh√°z is still called N√©psz√≠nh√°z utca. In 1948 the regime also demolished the National Stables behind the Museum in 1948, replacing them in 1969 with a modern office block unsympathetic to its grand surroundings. As the post-war communist regime consolidated its grip, the names of a number of streets and institutions in the Palotanegyed were changed. In 1946 F≈ëherceg S√°ndor utca (Archduke Alexander Street) was renamed Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca.:hu:Habsburg‚ÄìLotaringiai S√°ndor Lip√≥t magyar n√°dorS√°ndor Br√≥dy (writer) (1863-1924) was a Jewish-born novelist, dramatist, and short-story writer who was 'among the first in Hungarian literature to focus attention on the urban proletariat, and the first to introduce the coarse and pungent vernacular of the big city into literary works'. In the same year the metropolitan library in the former Wenckheim Palace was named the Szab√≥ Ervin Library in honour of Ervin Szab√≥, a revolutionary socialist who translated the works of Marx and Engels into Hungarian and who in 1911 had been appointed the library's director. In 1949, Eszterh√°zy utca and √ñtpacsirta utca were renamed Puskin utca. Two years later, in 1948, the section of Baross utca in front of the library was renamed Szab√≥ Ervin t√©r Surprisingly, the communist regime did not rename the J√≥zsef k√∂r√∫t (Joseph ringroad), named after the Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, as it did the Ter√©z and Erzs√©bet stretches of the ringroad, named after female Habsburg monarchs. In 1950, Hor√°nszky utca, named after Dual Monarchy-era Hungarian member of parliament and trade minister N√°ndor Hor√°nszky, was renamed Makarenko utca, in honour of Soviet educational theorist Anton Makarenko. Of the Palotanegyed‚Äôs eleven or so caf√©s which existed during Budapest‚Äôs pre-war heyday, all except one vanished.They were the Sas, Bodo, Simplon, Val√©ria, Commerce/De√°k, Spolarich, Walter Bern√°t/√öjh√°zi/MI√âNK - all on the J√≥zsefk√∂r√∫t; there was also the Balaton on R√°k√≥czi √∫t; and the Intim in the Gutenberg Otthon (see photo) Saly, T√∂rzsk√°v√©h√°zamb√≥l zen√©s k√°v√©h√°zba, Osiris Kiad√≥, 2005 The one survival, the Muz√©um, though it calls itself a caf√©-restaurant is today only a restaurant.  Since 1989  Despite the occasional acts of disdain and vandalism shown by the communist regime towards Budapest's historical fabric, the vast majority of the Palotanegyed's pre-World War II buildings survived war, revolution, Soviet occupation and the socialist decades. At the same time, by the early post-communist period, the J√≥zsefv√°ros had acquired a reputation amongst Hungarians as the poorest and most crime-ridden of the Pest districts. This reputation reflected the dilapidation and poverty especially of the outer part of the district (i.e. east of the J√≥zsefk√∂r√∫t) and the proportionately high population of typically poor gypsies in that area. This reputation coloured perceptions of the whole of J√≥zsefv√°ros, including, probably unfairly, the Palotanegyed. It was ironic given that historically the area had been one of the wealthiest parts of the city. One of the early decisions of the post-1989 democratic authorities was to restore some pre-communist street names. Hor√°nszky utca and √ñtpacsirta utca reappeared although Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca, Puskin utca and Szab√≥ Ervin t√©r remained unchanged. The 1930 statue of Count Nandor Zichy in front of what was his palace on L√∂rinc Pap t√©r returned. Palotanegyed map (2009) showing existing and planned road/footpath reconstructionThe elegant entrance of Br√≥dy House, in the Tauffer Palace, Br√≥dy S√°ndor u. 10Since the mid-1990s, the Palotanegyed's fortunes have steadily recovered. Many of the district's palaces have been restored, and slowly but surely other buildings are following suit. Local and international investors have seen that the area combines charm and inner-city convenience. And the J√≥zsefv√°ros local government has made much progress rebuilding the district's streets to make pedestrian-only areas, widen footpaths, rationalise parking, plant more trees and generally smarten the area up. As of February 2020, areas completed include Reviczky utca, √ñtpacsirta utca, Miksz√°th K√°lm√°n t√©r, the area between the Szab√≥ Ervin library and Calvin t√©r, L≈ërinc pap t√©r, Maria utca, K≈ëfarag√≥ utca, Gyulai P√°l utca, Hor√°nszky utca, much of Kr√∫dy utca, Gutenberg t√©r, Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca between the M√∫zeum k√∂r√∫t and Hor√°nszky utca and R√∂kk Szill√°rd utca. The mainly pedestrian area along Kr√∫dy utca between Miksz√°th K√°lm√°n t√©r and L≈ërinc pap t√©r thrives with restaurants and cafes in a way that wouldn't have been imagined before the 1989 changes. In May 2018 the J√≥zsefv√°ros council announced that funds had been also been allocated for reconstruction of sections of Szentkir√°lyi utca and that Puskin utca, Trefort utca and Somogyi B√©la utca would also be renovated. In April 2019 the council reported that the street reconstruction project would be undertaken as part of the third phase of the Europe Inner Cities programme and would comprise, in addition to work now completed on Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca and R√∂kk Szil√°rd utca, Szentkir√°lyi utca between Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca and Miksz√°th K√°lm√°n t√©r. Trefort utca and Pollack Mih√°ly t√©r 'could also be renovated in the future' In July 2016 the media reported that the Hungarian National Museum‚Äôs gardens would get a facelift, that three buildings belonging to Hungarian Radio - the former K√°rolyi and Eszterh√°zy palaces on Pollack Mih√°ly t√©r and the Magyar R√°dio palace at Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca 5-7 - would be renovated and used by the National Museum; that the two communist-era Hungarian Radio buildings on Pollack Mih√°ly t√©r would be demolished; and that the green spaces around the original palaces would be restored. The National Museum garden restoration project was completed in April 2019. But there was a change of plan and on 3 March 2020 the national government proposed legislation transferring ownership of the Hungarian Radio buildings in the Palotanegyed which were given to the National Museum in 2016, with the addition of Szentk√≠r√°lyi utca 25/A, 25/B and 27, to the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University. The Parliament approved the plan on 31 March. Tam√°s T√≥th, secretary of the Bishops‚Äô Conference, was quoted in the media saying it was important that the P√°zm√°ny university occupy the new properties as soon as possible, but that they would require renovation and that the process could take years. It was reported in June 2019 that the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University had also acquired the K√©m√©nysepr≈ë h√°z (the ‚ÄòChimney Sweep House‚Äô), the classicist building at Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca 15 built 1851-5 and designed by K√°roly Hild, brother of the more famous Budapest architect J√≥zsef Hild, which would house the university‚Äôs central offices. In April 2018 it was announced that Blaha Lujza t√©r would undergo a major renovation with green spaces replacing the current car-park area. At the same time, the 1926 Corvin √Åruh√°z (department store) would get a facelift with its communist-era aluminium layer removed and the original fa√ßade restored. Works were originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019, but the new J√≥zsefv√°ros council, elected in the October 2019 local elections, delayed the work while it reviewed the plans. J√≥zsefv√°ros deputy mayor D√°niel R√°dai was quoted in July 2020 saying that reconstruction of the square would start in the spring of 2021, at the same that the restoration of the facade of the Corvin √Åruh√°z, which was expected to take eighteen months. He also foreshadowed the reconstruction of so far unreconstructed streets in the Palace District, firstly Szentkir√°lyi utca. In July 2018 the council announced that thirteen Palotanegyed apartment buildings would be renovated alongside the reconstruction of sections of Br√≥dy S√°ndor utca, R√∂kk Szil√°rd utca and Szentkir√°lyi utca. The works were due for completion by the end of 2019. As of February 2020, the reconstruction works had not yet started on Szentk√≠r√°lyi utca.

Biography  Portrait of his nephew, Philip Weidling, by Fritz Schlemmer Ferdinand Louis 'Fritz' Schlemmer was born and raised in Crawfordsville, Indiana, the son of Otto and Louise (Miller) Schlemmer. He enrolled in Wabash College but soon left to study art in Chicago. He was noted as an athletic swimmer and basketball player. Along with Harold Heaton, Earl Russell, Fern Hobart Doubleday, he was extremely active for a couple of years in the \\"Paris Players\\" group traveling all over the United States to give performances for Chautauquas. While in Muskegon, Michigan the local Chronicle noted that their \\"Man Outside,\\" was \\"screamingly funny,\\" and the \\"most enjoyed program in this year's Chautauqua.\\" Their group was embodied in the Redpath Chautauqua company. In the Columbus (Georgia) Daily Enquirer, Monday May 29, 1916, Fritz Schlemmer was praised as a \\"master of lighting effects,\\" as well as mentioning his painting talents adding to the \\"effectiveness of the production.\\" Schlemmer was listed as having been in the Indiana National Guard for five years when he registered for World War I on May 25, 1917 (World War I Draft Card) while in Madison County, Mississippi during his Chautauqua days. He was listed as being \\"tall, of medium build, had brown hair and dark brown eyes.\\" Both his World War I and World War II draft cards list his birth date as September 26, 1891 as does his birth certificate in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Schlemmer was commissioned a first lieutenant with the 89th Infantry Division (United States) in 1917 and served as Divisional Camouflage Officer during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in World War I.Swift, Beth (2005), \\"Fritz Schlemmer was an Artist for Town, College\\", Crawfordsville Journal Review.

Loveys (April 25, 1929 ‚Äì February 22, 2017) was an American Republican Party politician who was elected to three terms in the New Jersey General Assembly, where he represented the 26th Legislative District. In 1988, Loveys was nominated to serve as head of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority by Governor Thomas Kean, but resigned after a year in office when Governor James Florio would not support a toll increase package Loveys had supported. Loveys was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts and attended Melrose High School, where he was captain of the football team. He went on to Middlebury College, where he was captain of the football team and was selected in the NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers. He served as a captain in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. Political career Loveys was the son of P. Augustus Loveys and J. Violet Jacobs Lovey. A resident of Florham Park, he served in various elected offices of borough government from 1968 to 1983, including Councilman, Council President, and Mayor. Loveys was first elected to the General Assembly in 1983, where vehicle insurance was one of the major issues he worked on in the legislature. Legislation introduced by Loveys and passed unanimously in the Assembly in June 1985 mandated a redesign of the New Jersey driver's license to allow organ donation information to be entered on the license itself, a proposal that the Transplant Foundation of New Jersey estimated could triple organ donations in the state.Connolly, William G. \\"NORTHEAST JOURNAL; Donating Organs In New Jersey\\", The New York Times, June 16, 1985.

The film initially begins as an examination of \\"Cropsey\\", a boogeyman-like figure from New York City urban legend, before segueing into the story of Andre Rand, a convicted child kidnapper from Staten Island. In , Cropsey premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, where programmer David Kwok stated; ‚Äúthe eeriness of the mystery pulsates through the film as they journey into the underbelly‚Ä¶ as more information and clues unravel, Zeman and Brancaccio become more immersed in shocking surprises and revelations. The reality they uncover in this uniquely hair-raising documentary is more terrifying than any urban legend.‚Äù Production Upon shooting their research of the origins of the missing kids‚Äô stories, Zeman and Brancaccio realized the truth did not dwindle into something concrete; instead, it expanded into something larger and convoluted, becoming an in depth investigation of five missing children‚Äôs stories. The objective was to bring the distinct elements into one overarching narrative: the oral tradition of urban legends; the mystery of the missing children; the courtroom drama; the search for the roots of Staten Island‚Äôs obsession with the case, the community‚Äôs need for catharsis. When filming began, Zeman and Brancaccio sent Andre Rand a letter. After not receiving a response for approximately a month, they decided to visit him directly at Rikers Island. On the day they were going to Rikers, they received the reply. After a series of letter exchanges, Rand agreed to an interview. However, by the time the filmmakers arrived at the prison, Rand had changed his mind and declined. Andre Rand‚Äôs court case did not start until four years after his indictment, which was one of the longest pre-trial motions in New York State history. The culmination of the film alludes to indicting Rand, which became controversial. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Cropsey holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 44 reviews, and an average rating of 7.2/10. It's consensus reads, \\"Riveting and bone- chillingly creepy, Cropsey manages to be one of the best documentaries and one of the best horror movies of the year.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \\"Cropsey is a creepy documentary with all the elements of a horror film about a demented serial killer, and an extra ingredient: This one is real.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times called it \\"Disturbing and flavorful\\", praising the film's use of archival footage, interviews, and \\"true-crime narrative\\". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"Cropsey is compelling as a meditation on how we use stories to explain the inconceivable, and how if no story is handy, we take the available clues and make one up.\\" J.R. Jones from The Chicago Reader praised the film as \\"disturbing\\", and praised the filmmakers exploration behind the real life inspiration behind the urban legend. Cynthia Fuches of PopMatters rated the film seven out of ten stars, offering the film similar praise as well is its storytelling and investigation aspects. The film was not without its detractors. Slant Magazine's Nick Schager awarded the film two out of four stars, writing, \\"Zeman‚Äôs portentous, trailer-ready narration and the film‚Äôs correspondingly manipulative horror-film aesthetics and fondness for creepy suggestions over vigorous journalism, typified by a wannabe-Zodiac ‚ÄúYou decide!‚Äù ending, turns what might have been a portrait of the boogeyman myth‚Äôs lingering societal role into merely a crude episode of 48 Hours.\\" Awards and nominations *Hammer to Nail: 2009 Tribeca‚Äôs Grand Jury Prize. *IndieWIRE‚Äôs 2009 Best Undistributed Film list, Annual Critics Survey. *Closing Night Film, SF Documentary Festival. *Audience Award Winner, Staten Island Film Festival.

This effect is primarily observed during algal blooms whereby an increase in algal biomass reduces the concentration of pollutants in organisms higher up in the food chain, like zooplankton or daphnia. The primary elements and pollutants of concern are heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, and lead. These toxins have been shown to bioaccumulate up a food web. In some cases, metals, such as mercury, can biomagnify. This is a major concern since methylmercury, the most toxic mercury species, can be found in high concentrations in human-consumed fish and other aquatic organisms. Numerous studies have linked lower mercury concentrations in zooplankton found in eutrophic (nutrient-rich and highly productive) as compared to oligotrophic (low nutrient) aquatic environments. Nutrient enrichment (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen) reduce the input of mercury, and other heavy metals, into aquatic food webs through this biodilution effect. Primary producers, such as phytoplankton, uptake these heavy metals and accumulate them into their cells. The higher the population of phytoplankton, the less concentrated these pollutants will be in their cells. Once consumed by primary consumers, such as zooplankton, these phytoplankton-bound pollutants are incorporated into the consumer‚Äôs cells. Higher phytoplankton biomass means a lower concentration of pollutants accumulated by the zooplankton, and so on up the food web. This effect causes an overall dilution of the original concentration up the food web. That is, the concentration of a pollutant will be lower in the zooplankton than the phytoplankton in a high bloom condition. Although most biodilution studies have been on freshwater environments, biodilution has been shown to occur in the marine environment as well. The Northwater Polynya, located in Baffin Bay, was found to have a negative correlation of cadmium, lead, and nickel with an increase in trophic level Cadmium and lead are both non-essential metals that will compete for calcium within an organism, which is detrimental for organism growth. Most studies measure bioaccumulation and biodilution using the Œ¥15N isotope of nitrogen. The Œ¥15N isotopic signature is enriched up the food web. A predator will have a higher Œ¥15N as compared to its prey. This trend allows the trophic position of an organism to be derived. Coupled to the concentration of a specific pollutant, such as mercury, the concentration verses trophic position can be accessed. While most heavy metals bioaccumulate, under certain conditions, heavy metals and organic pollutants have the potential to biodilute, making a higher organism less exposed to the toxin.

In Laminar Flow Fuel Cells (LFFC) this is achieved by exploiting the phenomenon of non-mixing laminar flows where the interface between the two flows works as a proton/ion conductor. The interface allows for high diffusivity and eliminates the need for costly membranes. The operating principles of these cells mean that they can only be built to millimeter-scale sizes. The lack of a membrane means they are cheaper but the size limits their use to portable applications which require small amounts of power. Another type of membraneless fuel cell is a Mixed Reactant Fuel Cell (MRFC). Unlike LFFCs, MRFCs use a mixed fuel and electrolyte, and are thus not subject to the same limitations. Without a membrane, MRFCs depend on the characteristics of the electrodes to separate the oxidation and reduction reactions. By eliminating the membrane and delivering the reactants as a mixture, MRFCs can potentially be simpler and less costly than conventional fuel cell systems. The efficiency of these cells is generally much higher than modern electricity producing sources. For example, a fossil fuel power plant system can achieve a 40% electrical conversion efficiency while an outdated nuclear power plant is slightly lower at 32%. GenIII and GenIV Nuclear Fission plants can get up to 90% efficient if using direct conversion or up to 65% efficient if using a magnetohydrodynamic generator as a topping cycle.Fuel cell systems are capable of reaching efficiencies in the range of 55%‚Äì70%. However, as with any process, fuel cells also experience inherent losses due to their design and manufacturing processes.  Overview  Fuel Cell Diagram. Note: Electrolyte can be a polymer or solid oxide A fuel cell consists of an electrolyte which is placed in between two electrodes ‚Äì the cathode and the anode. In the simplest case, hydrogen gas passes over the cathode, where it is decomposed into hydrogen protons and electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte (often NAFION ‚Äì manufactured by DuPont) across to the anode to the oxygen. Meanwhile, the free electrons travel around the cell to power a given load and then combine with the oxygen and hydrogen at the anode to form water. Two common types of electrolytes are a proton exchange membrane(PEM) (also known as Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) and a ceramic or solid oxide electrolyte (often used in Solid oxide fuel cells). Although hydrogen and oxygen are very common reactants, a plethora of other reactants exist and have been proven effective. Hydrogen for fuel cells can be produced in many ways. The most common method in the United States (95% of production) is via Gas reforming, specifically using methane,Ragheb, Magdi. \\"Steam Reforming.\\" Lecture. Energy Storage Systems. University of Illinois, 3 Oct. 2010. Web. 12 Oct. 2010. . which produces hydrogen from fossil fuels by running them through a high temperature steam process. Since fossil fuels are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen molecules of various sizes, various fossil fuels can be utilized. For example, methanol, ethanol, and methane can all be used in the reforming process. Electrolysis and high temperature combination cycles are also used to provide hydrogen from water whereby the heat and electricity provide sufficient energy to disassociate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, since these methods of hydrogen production are often energy and space intensive, it is often more convenient to use the chemicals directly in the fuel cell. Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC's), for example, use methanol as the reactant instead of first using reformation to produce hydrogen. Although DMFC's are not very efficient (~25%),Kin, T., W. Shieh, C. Yang, and G. Yu. \\"Estimating the Methanol Crossover Rate of PEM and the Efficiency of DMFC via a Current Transient Analysis.\\" Journal of Power Sources 161.2 (2006): 1183‚Äì186. Print. they are energy dense which means that they are quite suitable for portable power applications. Another advantage over gaseous fuels, as in the H2-O2 cells, is that liquids are much easier to handle, transport, pump and often have higher specific energies allowing for greater power extraction. Generally gases need to be stored in high pressure containers or cryogenic liquid containers which is a significant disadvantage to liquid transport.  Membraneless Fuel Cells and Operating Principles  The majority of fuel cell technologies currently employed are either PEM or SOFC cells. However, the electrolyte is often costly and not always completely effective. Although hydrogen technology has significantly evolved, other fossil fuel based cells (such as DMFC's) are still plagued by the shortcomings of proton exchange membranes. For example, fuel crossover means that low concentrations need to be used which limits the available power of the cell. In solid oxide fuel cells, high temperatures are needed which require energy and can also lead to quicker degradation of materials. Membraneless fuel cells offer a solution to these problems.  Laminar Flow  A vortex street around a cylinder. At the beginning of the vortex, both fluids are separate. This indicates laminar flow with minimal mixing. Picture courtesy, Cesareo de La Rosa Siqueira. LFFC's overcome the problem of unwanted crossover through the manipulation of the Reynolds number, which describes the behavior of a fluid. In general, at low Reynolds numbers, flow is laminar whereas turbulence occurs at a higher Reynolds number. In laminar flow, two fluids will interact primarily through diffusion which means mixing is limited. By choosing the correct fuel and oxidizing agents in LFFC's, protons can be allowed to diffuse from the anode to the cathode across the interface of the two streams.1\\\\. E.R. Choban, L.J. Markoski, A. Wieckowski, P.J.A. Kenis, Micro-Fluidic Fuel Cell Based on Laminar Flow. J. Power Sources, 2004,128, 54‚Äì60. The LFFC's are not limited to a liquid feed and in certain cases, depending on the geometry and reactants, gases can also be advantageous. Current designs inject the fuel and oxidizing agent into two separate streams which flow side by side. The interface between the fluids acts as the electrolytic membrane across which protons diffuse. Membraneless fuel cells offer a cost advantage due to the lack of the electrolytic membrane. Further, a decrease in crossover also increases fuel efficiency resulting in higher power output.  Diffusion  Diffusion across the interface is extremely important and can severely affect fuel cell performance. The protons need to be able to diffuse across both the fuel and the oxidizing agent. The diffusion coefficient, a term which describes the ease of diffusion of an element in another medium, can be combined with Fick's laws of diffusion which addresses the effects of a concentration gradient and distance over which diffusion occurs: :\\\\bigg. J = - D \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\bigg. where * J is the diffusion flux in dimensions of [(amount of substance) length‚àí2 time‚àí1], example \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{\\\\mathrm{mol}}{ m^2\\\\cdot s}\\\\right). J measures the amount of substance that will flow through a small area during a small time interval. * \\\\, D is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity in dimensions of [length2 time‚àí1], example \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{m^2}{s}\\\\right) * \\\\, \\\\phi (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration in dimensions of [(amount of substance) length‚àí3], example \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{\\\\mathrm{mol}}{m^3}\\\\right) * \\\\, x is the diffusion length i.e. the distance over which diffusion occurs In order to increase the diffusion flux, the diffusivity and/or concentration need to be increased while the length needs to be decreased. In DMFC's for example, the thickness of the membrane determines the diffusion length while the concentration is often limited due to crossover. Thus, the diffusion flux is limited. A membraneless fuel cell is theoretically the better option since the diffusion interface across both fluids is extremely thin and using higher concentrations does not result in a drastic effect on crossover. In most fuel cell configurations with liquid feeds, the fuel and oxidizing solutions almost always contain water which acts as a diffusion medium. In many hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, the diffusion of oxygen at the cathode is rate limiting since the diffusivity of oxygen in water is much lower than that of hydrogen.Fukada, Satoshi. \\"Analysis of Oxygen Reduction Rate in a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell.\\" Energy Conversion and Management 42.9 (2000): 1121.

Print. As a result, LFFC performance can also be improved by not using aqueous oxygen carriers.  Research and development  The promise of membraneless fuel cells has been offset by several problems inherent to their designs. Ancillary structures are one of the largest obstacles. For example, pumps are required to maintain laminar flow while gas separators can be needed to supply the correct fuels into the cells. For micro fuel cells, these pumps and separators need to be miniaturized and packaged into a small volume (under 1 cm3). Associated with this process is a so-called \\"packaging penalty\\" which results in higher costs. Further, pumping power drastically increases with decreasing size (see Scaling Laws) which is disadvantageous. Efficient packaging methods and/or self-pumping cells (see Research and Development) need to be developed to make this technology viable. Also, while using high concentrations of specific fuels, such as methanol, crossover still occurs. This problem can be partially solved by using a nanoporous separator, lowering fuel concentrationHollinger, Adam S., R. J. Maloney, L. J. Markoski, P. J. Kenis, R. S. Jayashree, and D. Natarajan. \\"Nanoporous Separator and Low Fuel Concentration to Minimize Crossover in Direct Methanol Laminar Flow Fuel Cells.\\" Journal of Power Sources 195.11 (2010): 3523‚Äì528. Print. or choosing reactants which have a lower tendency towards crossover. Date: January 2010: Researchers developed a novel method of inducing self-pumping in a membraneless fuel cell. Using formic acid as a fuel and sulfuric acid as an oxidant, CO2 is produced in the reaction in the form of bubbles. The bubbles nucleate and coalesce on the anode. A check valve at the supply end prevents any fuel entering while the bubbles are growing. The check valve is not mechanical but hydrophobic in nature. By creating micro structures which form specific contact angles with water, fuel cannot be drawn backwards. As the reaction continues, more CO2 is formed while fuel is consumed. The bubble begins to propagate towards the outlet of the cell. However, before the outlet, a hydrophobic vent allows the carbon dioxide to escape while simultaneously ensuring other byproducts (such as water) do not clog the vent. As the carbon dioxide is being vented, fresh fuel is also drawn in at the same through the check valve and the cycle begins again. Thus, the fuel cell pumping is regulated by the reaction rate. This type of cell is not a two stream laminar flow fuel cell. Since the formation of bubbles can disrupt two separate laminar flows, a combined stream of fuel and oxidant was used. In laminar conditions, mixing will still not occur. It was found that using selective catalysts (i.e. Not platinum) or extremely low flow rates can prevent crossover.D. D. Meng and C.-J. Kim, ‚ÄúMicropumping of liquid by directional growth and selective venting of gas Bubbles‚Äù, Lab on a Chip, 8 (2008), pp. 958- 968.Meng, D. D., J. Hur, and C.

Print.  Scaling Issues  Membraneless fuel cells are currently being manufactured on the micro scale using fabrication processes found in the MEMS/NEMS area. These cell sizes are suited for the small scale due to the limit of their operating principles. The scale-up of these cells to the 2‚Äì10 Watt range has proven difficultAbruna, H., and A. Stroock. \\"Transport Phenomena and Interfacial Kinetics in Planar Microfluidic Membraneless Fuel Cells.\\" Hydrogen Program. U.S. Department of Energy. Web. 25 Nov. 2010. . since, at large scales, the cells cannot maintain the correct operating conditions. For example, laminar flow is a necessary condition for these cells. Without laminar flow, crossover would occur and a physical electrolytic membrane would be needed. Maintaining laminar flow is achievable on the macro scale but maintaining a steady Reynolds number is difficult due to variations in pumping. This variation causes fluctuations at the reactant interfaces which can disrupt laminar flow and affect diffusion and crossover. However, self-pumping mechanisms can be difficult and expensive to produce on the macro-scale. In order to take advantage of hydrophobic effects, the surfaces need to be smooth to control the contact angle of water. To produce these surfaces on a large scale, the cost will significantly increase due to the close tolerances which are needed. Also, it is not evident whether using a carbon-dioxide based pumping system on the large scale is viable. Membraneless fuel cells can utilize self-pumping mechanisms but requires the use of fuel which release GHG's (greenhouse gases) and other unwanted products. To use an environmentally friendly fuel configuration (such as H2-O2), self pumping can be difficult. Thus, external pumps are required. However, for a rectangular channel, the pressure required increases proportional to the L‚àí3, where L is a length unit of the cell. Thus, by decreasing the size of a cell from 10 cm to 1 cm, the required pressure will increase by 1000. For micro fuel cells, this pumping requirement requires high voltages. Although in some cases, Electroosmotic flow can be induced. However, for liquid mediums, high voltages are also required. Further, with decreasing size, surface tension effects also become significantly more important. For the fuel cell configuration with a carbon dioxide generating mechanism, the surface tension effects could also increase the pumping requirements drastically.  Potential Applications of LFFCs  The thermodynamic potential of a fuel cell limits the amount of power that an individual cell can deliver. Therefore, in order to obtain more power, fuel cells must be connected in series or parallel (depending on whether greater current or voltage is desired). For large scale building and automobile power applications, macro fuel cells can be used because space is not necessarily the limiting constraint. However, for portable devices such as cell phones and laptops, macro fuel cells are often inefficient due to their space requirements lower run times. LFFCs however, are perfectly suited for these types of applications. The lack of a physical electrolytic membrane and energy dense fuels that can be used means that LFFC's can be produced at lower costs and smaller sizes. In most portable applications, energy density is more important than efficiency due to the low power requirements.

It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on October 13, 2010. In the episode, New Jersey is rapidly taking over the nation one state at a time and their next stop is South Park. As the Jerseyites spill into Colorado and approach South Park, the town stands strong against the onslaught. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. In its original American broadcast on October 13, 2010, \\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" was watched by 3.253 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It was the highest-viewed scripted show. It received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49. This is the first episode to be announced immediately following another's airing since \\"The Passion of the Jew\\"; all other episodes since Season 9 have been announced on a Friday or a Monday. However, it is not the first to release a preview clip right after the previous episode. The episode \\"200\\" had a preview clip released for it the day after the episode before it, \\"You Have 0 Friends\\", was aired (even though that preview clip was not used in the final episode). The episode revolves around the invasion of South Park by the Jerseyites, based on characters from the MTV reality show, Jersey Shore and from The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Bravo. Footage from the opening credits of the MTV series is used. Plot When a family from New Jersey moves into South Park, Sharon invites the family into their home for dinner. The tacky Jersey woman, Teresa Giudice from the Real Housewives of New Jersey, becomes very obnoxious very quickly, and starts to insult Sharon and her friends, leading Sharon to insult her calmly. Teresa goes crazy and flips the dinner table and shouts expletives at Sharon, but is calmed down by her husband Joe. Soon after, many people from New Jersey move into South Park and everyone starts to get annoyed with them. Randy calls a meeting at the Park County Community Center, where he reveals that New Jersey is trying to take over the country and already has everything east of the Rocky Mountains, with all of Colorado in danger of becoming \\"West Jersey\\". Meanwhile, after another altercation with the New Jersey housewives and Sharon at the hair salon, Sheila reveals that she is originally from New Jersey after defending Sharon from the other ladies, and that she was once a notorious party girl nicknamed \\"S-Woww-Tittybang\\". When the other families find out, Cartman shuns Kyle from their group, stating that if he is Jersey (along with being Jewish and ginger, which Cartman already hates him for), he is all bad. Later that night, Kyle (in a parody of the first transformation scene in Teen Wolf), seemingly unable to control his actions, begins to cut and grease his bushy Jewfro into a style similar to Pauly D's hairstyle from Jersey Shore. He is even more shocked to find Sheila now fully decked out in this fashion; Sheila tells Kyle that \\"it's not so bad, some people like the Jersey look\\", only to have Ike scream and faint after looking into the room and spotting them. Sheila reveals to her son that he's technically from New Jersey: Kyle was conceived in New Jersey and during the first two months that Sheila was pregnant with him, she and Kyle's father, Gerald, were living with Sheila's parents in Newark, New Jersey. Whenever either of them is around New Jersey influences, she says, they will start to exhibit the same behavior. Cartman's usual distrust of Kyle grows even stronger, since Kyle is now the \\"three J's\\" - \\"Jinger (ginger), Jersey and Jew\\", although Stan and Kenny don't seem to care and they just help out the other townspeople try to drive the Jerseyites out. Desperate for assistance, after having built a barricade of junk and handing out a stock of what appear to be lever-action rifles and muskets from crates of mysterious origin, Randy pleads for help from California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who tells him that the state cannot provide any assistance due to budget problems and general lack of concern (then Randy tries telling him that \\"if Colorado falls, you're next\\", only to be told that actually Utah and Nevada stand between California and the invasion). Likewise, Japan also refuses to help. At this point, Randy decides they must seek help from their enemies: al-Qaeda. The townspeople are shocked at this idea, saying that the feelings of the families of the victims of 9/11 matter \\"another ten months\\" (the tenth anniversary of the attacks). But then Randy and other men are called to the bar, where in a satire of horror movie clich√©s, they encounter a sex-crazed and barely human Snooki. In desperation, Randy videotapes a request for help from al-Qaeda and sends it to Osama bin Laden. As the townspeople arm themselves and barricade the streets to stave off the invasion, Cartman asks Kyle to meet him at the Sizzler, with the intent of locking him in the meat freezer so he can't help the Jerseyites. Once Cartman opens the freezer, Snooki springs out and begins to rape him and Dog Poo. Kyle now fully transforms into a guido, complete with rings and gold neck chain and calling himself \\"Kyley B\\", and proceeds to insult and hit Snooki, until she flees the restaurant‚Äîwhich Cartman thanks Kyle for. In the streets, Randy violently interrogates Michael \\"The Situation\\" Sorrentino, who can only answer \\"It's just a Jersey thing, you know, you just gotta be from Jersey to get it.\\" The townspeople hold off the hordes of Jerseyites until their ammunition runs out and their defense seems futile. However, just as the invaders begin to overrun the barricades, a fleet of al-Qaeda suicide pilots fly in and crash their planes into the ground, killing them all in a parody of Saving Private Ryan. At a town meeting soon after, Randy proudly thanks bin Laden for his help in stopping the invasion and reveals that their victory has inspired the rest of the East Coast to drive the Jerseyites back to their own state. With the Jerseyites defeated, Cartman tells Kyle \\"You're a monster, but you're my little monster\\" - and just as bin Laden receives a hero medal, a Special Forces commando comes in and kills him. At first the people are shocked, but then Randy exclaims \\"We got him!\\" Production and cultural references alt=A brown-haired man wearing a white shirt and gray jacket smiles. \\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker.

The scene at the beginning in which Teresa Giudice becomes angry and flips the dinner table at Sharon is a parody of The Real Housewives of New Jersey season one episode six \\"Finale\\" involving the final dinner scene. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on October 13, 2010, \\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" was watched by 3.253 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. The episode received a 2.1 rating/4 share, meaning it was seen by 2.1 percent of the population, and 4 percent of people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, the episode received a 1.9 rating/5 share, rising one tenth in the ratings resulting in approximately 100, 000 more viewers than the previous episode. Among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode received a 3.9 rating/13 share.  Critical response  The episode received largely positive reviews. Katla McGlynn of The Huffington Post, referred to the revelation of Snooki as the best moment of the episode. Ramsey Isler of IGN rated the episode with a 7.5/10 saying \\"the fact that the majority of the story was just a half-hearted satire of Jersey shows that Robot Chicken could've done better, is a sign that something's amiss.\\" Brad Trechak of AOL's TV Squad stated in his review \\"As a New Jersey native, I should have been really offended by tonight's episode of South Park. Sadly, I was laughing too hard to notice.\\" He also felt the show \\"walks a line between humor and bad taste\\". Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a B. He compared the episode to \\"South Park Is Gay!\\" and \\"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset\\" although he stated that \\"\\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" may not prove to have the lasting appeal of the aforementioned\\" episodes. Reaction from those spoofed Despite being ridiculed and spoofed by the show, the reactions from the people who were spoofed were mostly positive. Nicole \\"Snooki\\" Polizzi wrote on Twitter, \\"Snooki want smoosh smoosh. [I'm] going to have nightmares tonight lmao!!! [We've] officially made it...\\". Angelina Pivarnick posted a picture of Snooki as depicted in the episode and commented \\"Haaaaa wat a jokee. Lil gremlin\\". DJ Pauly D posted a shot of the Jersey-fied Kyle after a fan said they were \\"like twins\\", while The Situation posted a link to the episode while commenting \\"Southpark Situation! Hilarious!\\". Castmate Vinny Guadagnino commented \\"...my face was on South Park, im good now\\". Teresa Giudice from The Real Housewives of New Jersey initially claimed to have not watched the episode, but later claimed she was \\"honored to be mocked by them\\", especially in light of the other mockeries. Former co- castmember Danielle Staub was pleasantly surprised that \\"...it wasn't just me being made fun of for a change. You realize you're something else when you're being made into a cartoon.

It is the lowest part of the drill string, extending from the bit to the drill pipe. The assembly can consist of drill collars, subs such as stabilizers, reamers, shocks, hole-openers, and the bit sub and bit. The BHA design is based upon the requirements of having enough weight transfer to the bit (WOB) to be able to drill and achieve a sufficient Rate of Penetration (ROP), giving the Driller or Directional Driller directional control to drill as per the planned trajectory and to also include whatever Logging While Drilling (LWD) / Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tools for formation evaluation. As such BHA design can vary greatly from simple vertical wells with little or now LWD requirements to complex directional wells which must run multi-combo LWD suites. Prior to running a BHA most oilfield service providers have software to model the BHA behaviour such as the maximum WOB achievable, the directional tendencies & capabilities and even the natural harmonics of the assembly as to avoid vibration brought about by exciting natural frequencies. Variations=Rotary assembly Rotary assemblies are commonly used where formations are predictable and the rig economics are an issue. In such an assembly the weight of the drill collars gives the BHA the tendency to sag or flex to the low side of the hole, collar stiffness length and stabilizer diameter and placement are engineered as a means of controlling the flex of the BHA. This will bring about the desired hold, build or drop tendency. The ability to vary the directional tendency of the assembly comes from varying the weight on the bit. A fixed assembly has only one directional tendency. The weight on bit allows you to tune that tendency. The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) can be: * slick with no stabilizers * a pendulum bottom-hole assembly for reducing the deviation of a well * packed with stabilizers for a straight hole / a short lock assembly * a fulcrum for increasing the deviation of the well / a long lock assembly Bottom-hole assemblies are also described as * specialized, such as articulated, * steerable, and * oriented or non-oriented. Fulcrum / Long Lock This assembly is used to build angle. The assembly usually incorporates a near bit stabilizer. Behind this would be a selection of drill collars and Heavy Weight Drill Pipe (HWDP). The length of the section AFTER the near bit stabilizer would determine the extent of the angle build rate. After the appropriate length of pipe after the near bit stabilizer you would place a drill string stabilizer. In short the longer the gap between the near bit and the drill string stabilizer the greater the angle building rate. Care must be taken to not have this section too long as the pipe may sag too much and rub against the borehole wall. This could result in key seating and pipe digging into the borehole wall. Stabilization / Short Lock This assembly is usually used to maintain borehole angle. This assembly is very rigid allowing little movement of the bit. Such an assembly would mean that the stabilizers are closely packed: a near bit stabilizer within 0‚Äì30 feet of the drill bit, and two more spaced 30 and 60 feet beyond it. If a short drill collar is used, then the stabilizers can be even closer together. The shorter the distance between the stabilizers means that the drill collars bend less and the weight on bit (WOB) pushes directly on the bit, hence maintaining the angle. Pendulum assembly A pendulum assembly is used to reduce the angle build rate or reduce well-bore angle. In this assembly there is no near bit assembly. The front portion of the (BHA) is allowed to hang as a result of its own weight. In such a case the first stabilizer is placed 30‚Äì45 feet behind the bit. This hanging means that there is a force acting on the low side of the hole, which causes the deviation. In the case of a straight hole then the bit simply continues downward. BHA configurations There are three types of BHA configurations. These configurations addressed are usually concerned with the use or layout of drill collars, heavy weight drill pipe and standard drill pipe. Type 1, standard simple configuration, uses only drill pipe and drill collars. In this instance the drill collars provide the necessary weight on the bit. Type 2 uses heavy weight drill pipe as a transition between the drill collars and the drill pipe. Weight on bit is achieved by the drill collars. Type 3 uses the drill collars to achieve directional control. The heavy weight drill pipe applies the weight on the bit. Such a layout promotes faster rig floor BHA handling. It may also reduce the tendency for differential sticking. In most cases the above three types of configurations usually apply to straight/vertical wellbores at most low to medium angle wellbores. For high angle and horizontal wellbore careful weight control of the BHA is a must. In this instance the weight may be applied by running the drill pipe in compression in the high angle section. The high angle may help to stabilize the drill pipe allowing it to carry some compression. BHA tools=Stabilizer A stabilizer is used within a column of drill collars. They help guide the bit in the hole. They play a major part in directional drilling as it helps determine the well-bore path and angle. It is used to * equalize the load on the bit; * prevent whirl of the lower assembly; * minimize bit walk; * minimize bending and vibrations that cause tool joint wear; * prevent collar contact with the sidewall of the bore-hole; * minimize key-seating with differential pressure; * restrict lateral movement of the lower BHA as such they lower the strain on the drill collar and BHA connections. Solid stabilizers have no moving or replaceable parts. The blades and the mandrel can be one piece (integral) or welded to the mandrel (weld- on/welded blade). The blades may be either straight or spiral. The working surface can be impregnated with tungsten carbide or diamonds inserts. Replaceable blade stabilizers can maintain full gauge stabilization, but their blades can be changed with tools no machining or welding required Sleeve type stabilizers have replaceable sleeves that can be changed in the field. The sleeves are either rotating or non-rotating. Reamers are stabilizers that have cutting elements embedded on their fins, and are used to maintain a gauged well-bore. They can be used to drill out doglegs and key-seats in hard formations. Due to the cutting ability of the reamer the bit does less work in maintaining well-bore gauge and more work drilling. Underreamer An underreamer is used to enlarge the well-bore, usually beginning at some point under the surface. It does this by utilizing expandable cutters that only deploy at the designated time or depth. It is not to be confused with hole opening which occurs from the surface and in most cases the hole opener tool is of a fixed diameter. The underreamer utilizes an increase in mud pressure or flow rate to deploy the expandable cutters. A corresponding pressure drop across the tool would indicate that the tool has fully deployed.

It is the third installation in the Swindle series. Plot summary The story takes place in Cedarville, while 'The Man with the Plan' Griffin Bing is having a hard time adjusting to his school's new atmosphere, which is more like a strict boot camp than a middle school. His new football fanatic Principal, Dr. Egan, does not like Griffin, due to his past. To make matters worse, somebody has stolen the priceless Super Bowl ring that was in the school's showcase, with Griffin's retainer that he recently lost left in its place. For once, the Man with the Plan DOESN'T have a plan. Things only go from bad to worse when Griffin is accused of stealing it by Egan, and Griffin is sent to a state school for juvenile delinquents. Griffin realizes he has been framed by somebody and calculates a list of suspects: * Dr. Egan, (dubbed Dr. Evil) the principal who hates Griffin and could gain the ring as a football collectors item, as he loves the sport. * Celia White, a nosy reporter who is digging up dirt on Griffin. She often twists his words, and she will do anything to make him look guilty, possibly to gain a promotion. * Darren Vader, a burly boy who annoys Griffin. He could steal the ring after finding Griffin's retainer in order to gain profit. His motive for framing Griffin would be to distract the police from him. He earlier was one of the 7 in Swindle to help Griffin retrieve a Babe Ruth Baseball card. * Tony Bartholomew, a boy who claims he is the rightful owner of the super bowl ring. Griffin tries to get the suspects through a metal detector at the courthouse after sending them an anonymous e-mail stating that a buyer was interested in purchasing a valuable possession that \\"recently\\" came to them. Griffin unfortunately discovers that Dr. Egan is the only suspect left. Logan, Griffin's friend and amateur actor, agrees to get to know Egan's daughter so he can search the house and find the ring, getting him off the hook. The plan fails when they discover Egan does not have the ring. Griffin is placed under house arrest, where his friends meet him via video chat and formulate a final plan to clear their friend's name. Savannah, the animal lover of the group, finds that a type of rat is attracted to shiny objects and may have found Griffin's lost retainer then swapped it out with the ring. Melissa, the computer whiz, hacks into Griffin's house arrest system that allows him to leave the house without the alarm coming off while his parents are out. At the school during its play, Hail Caesar!, Griffin leads Egan to the pack rat's nest and clears his name. He is then raced home and resets his house arrest anklet as his parents arrive. Egan, who got Griffin home in time, clears up matters and apologizes to Griffin, saying that he was wrong to judge him. Also, Celia White shows up in an attempt to get a story on him. Before she can twist the words, however, Egan makes her stop and makes sure she won't be doing it again. After this, Griffin asks the court if it will take a truly good-hearted friend, Shank, out of the state school, so he can have a chance at life. They accept and it is implied that life will be better for Griffin and his friends.framed.htm Framed! at Fantastic Fiction Sequel There is a sequel in the works called Showoff.

He is regarded as one of the three key figures in the post war revival of the sport of polo in the United Kingdom. He single-handedly restarted Ham Polo Club in 1946.  Early life  Like so many of the pioneers of polo in the western world Billy Walsh was an Irishman, born in County Kilkenny. In the 1920s he went to the USA where he gained his initial skills and a talent that was to take him to 5-goals by 1928.  Polo career  In 1933, Walsh went to work for Major Philip Magor training the many Argentine polo ponies imported by Magor to Roehampton Polo Club. Walsh became recognised throughout the polo world for his skills in making polo ponies - it has been said that his handicap could have been much higher had he spent more time playing, rather than training. In 1936, Captain Tom Brigg, owner of the Equestrian Centre at Ham Gate and member of the Swaine Adney Brigg family, invited Walsh to run his stables and teach polo there. Three years later he joined the cavalry and, after his army service returned to Ham to find that Capt. Brigg had died and that the Equestrian Centre was for on the market. Using his gratuity, he bought the stables and revived Ham Polo Club under HPA rules. Walsh was on the winning team with Ham Polo Club in 1947 in the first polo tournament to be played in post war England. The team took home the prestigious Roehampton Trophy. In 1977, Walsh gave up the game. It was not until 1982 though that he gave up the position of manager of Ham Polo Club to become the President. He has been succeeded as manager by two generations. Firstly his daughter Peggy Healy and secondly his grand son Tim Healy. The Billy Walsh Tournament is still played at Ham Polo Clubhttp://www.livingpolo.com/news/2435-el-billy-walsh-tournament- en-el-ham-polo-club/ today, the finals are held in September. The Hurlingham Polo Association blue book noted in tribute to Billy that it was due to his 'initiative, determination and enthusiasm that Ham Polo Club grew and flourished under his patrician eye\\" In 1985, on International Day, the Queen presented Walsh with a bronze of a polo player and pony, donated by his many friends in recognition of his lifelong work. At the 2007 Audi Polo Awards, the La Martina Lifetime Achievement Award was given to Walsh for his contribution to the sport.http://www.audipoloawards.com/voting.html  Family  Walsh was married to Ivy and had two children, Peggy and Brian. Their daughter Peggy married actor David Healy. They had two sons William and Tim, who are both polo players.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 November 1992, and was vested in the Trust on 16 December 1993. The previous church had been built around 1190, in an Early English style with Norman features. In 1301 the patron of the church was John De la Mare. By 1846 the church was in a dilapidated condition and it would have cost more to repair than rebuild. The new church was commissioned by Joseph Neeld and designed by James Thomson, who also designed the nearby Grittleton House. Stonework from the earlier church, including the bell tower, was reused by Thomson to build Sevington School. The Gothic chancel includes a reredos which is carved and decorated in many colours. The west window has stained glass by Thomas Wilmshurst. There are many memorials including those to the Neeld Baronets. A new organ was installed in 1896, and electricity supplied in 1949, although attendance by this time was very low. The building was designated as Grade II* listed in 1960, and the roadside lychgate as Grade II in 1988. The church was closed as a regular place of worship in 1992. In the 21st century a 15th-century stone rood which had been hidden under the pews was restored by Minerva Conservation and placed in the chancel. In 2016 the church was used as a venue for \\"pop-up\\" opera with a performance of The Barber of Seville.

They are a six- piece line-up whose members are Robert Bradiƒçiƒá (electric guitar and vocals), Ana Horvat (vocals), Damir Matkoviƒá (piano and vocals), Jo≈°ko Serdareviƒá (drums), Mladen Sriƒáa (bass guitar and vocals) and Nata≈°a Veljak (fiddle). The musical genre that they play is best described as a combination of new traditional honky-tonk and western swing. Their overall sound is to a large extent defined by short, but frequent instrumental solos which often follow each other in quick succession. Owing to remarkable skills of most ‚ÄúCrooks & Straights‚Äù musicians, this has gradually grown to be recognised as the band's trademark.  History  The band's origins go back to October 1999. ‚ÄúCrooks & Straights‚Äù were then jointly founded by Damir Matkoviƒá and Mladen Sriƒáa. Damir Matkoviƒá cut his first musical teeth on the local scene in the instrumental jazz-rock group ‚ÄûAnonymus.‚Äú where he stayed until 1986 when he left the group and departed for Germany. In ensuing years he played as a professional musician on the German club scene as a member of various local bands. Final months of his German episode saw him for the first time appear in a country outfit. That was a band from Apolda called ‚ÄúRodeo‚Äú. Mladen Sriƒáa built most of his name on the Rijeka music scene as the bass player in pop bands ‚ÄûGrafiti‚Äú and ‚ÄûVAMP‚Äú. ‚ÄûVAMP‚Äú were at one point just a step away from signing a recording deal with ‚ÄûOrfej‚Äú, a label from Zagreb, but the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence first disrupted and later put a complete stop to their existence. ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú have always been a six-piece band. Their first line-up was formed after Damir Matkoviƒá had invited Aleksandar Grma≈° on acoustic guitar and Jo≈°ko Serdareviƒá on drums to join the group and Mladen Sriƒáa did the same with Sini≈°a Kataliniƒá on electric guitar and Gorana ƒåehiƒá on fiddle. Among them, the most famous name was undoubtedly Jo≈°ko Serdareviƒá, member of famous pop groups way back in time of former Yugoslavia. In the second half of the 70's he played in ‚ÄûVrijeme i zemlja‚Äú (‚ÄúTime And Earth‚Äù), and in the first half of the 80's he was a member of ‚ÄûXenia‚Äú, one of the most popular Yugoslav pop acts of that era. At the time of invitation to join ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú, he had just returned home after ten years as a professional musician in Switzerland. Sini≈°a Kataliniƒá was guitarist in the Rijeka rock formation ‚ÄûThe Stuff‚Äú who, if active in terms of discography, never really moved beyond the status of just being a local act. Gorana ƒåehiƒá had for several years been a member of only slightly more famous rockabilly- country formation ‚ÄûMississippi Queen‚Äú from Zagreb. When she received an invitation to throw in her lot with ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú, she was a student at the ‚ÄûIno Mirkoviƒá‚Äú classical music academy in Lovran.  First phase  After only a few months, even before ‚ÄúCrooks & Straights‚Äù could make their debut on stage, Sini≈°a Kataliniƒá left the band, unhappy with what he saw as too much time spent on preparations for the first live appearance. However, his departure was hardly noticed as the vacancy was immediately filled by Robert Bradiƒçiƒá. He had once played in ‚ÄûVAMP‚Äú together with Mladen Sriƒáa, who now offered him a place of the lead guitarist in ‚ÄúCrooks & Straights‚Äù. Having just returned from Spain where he had spent several years as a professional musician, he accepted the offer on the spot. And so the line-up Bradiƒçiƒá, ƒåehiƒá, Grma≈°, Matkoviƒá, Serdarevƒá and Sriƒáa was the one in which ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú made their premiere appearance in the ‚ÄûRiver Pub‚Äú in Rijeka, in January 2001. At first ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú built their playlist mostly around covers of most popular American acts, only occasionally arranging an odd standard in their own way. In spite of that, though, they started gigging not only in Croatia, but also abroad, for starters at the venues in Italy and Slovenia.  Second phase and recording debut  After a number of concerts both in Croatia and abroad, the band had their recording debut at the international scene on \\"International Country Music Sampler\\" CD, in October 2002, released by Comstock Records, an independent label from Fountain Hills, Arizona, United States. The song \\"Crooks & Straights\\" were represented with on this compilation was their own take on Melvin Endsley‚Äôs standard \\"Singing the Blues\\". That way, they became the first act from Croatia whose recorded material was published, promoted and distributed by an American label. Owing to this release, the listeners of many European radio stations in shows primarily devoted to country music got their first chance to hear how country, an inherently American type of music, was being played on Croatian Mediterranean. Appearance on a compilation of this type and ensuing interest in them clearly led the band members to realisation that it was now time to record their own first album. Consequently, during 2002 and first half of 2003 they selected and recorded material that was going to find itself on that first release. The work on this album inevitably marked a shift towards self- penned compositions, so for the first time among the recorded material there were now four original songs, as well. The rest was filled with own arrangements of American country standards, among them notably the already mentioned \\"Singing the Blues\\" with which they had made their introduction to European audiences. However, the release of the first album was stalled, not entirely unexpectedly, because at the end of 2003 Aleksandar Grma≈° decided to leave not only the band but also musical scene altogether and devote himself to entirely unrelated activities. As the group had already had an arranged tour in Germany, they reached a compromise agreement with Grma≈° according to which he postponed his departure until after that series of German concerts was over. Also, band's activities were not exactly helped by the fact that in the meantime Gorana ƒåehiƒá had graduated from her Academy, married her Italian boyfriend and moved to live in Italy. On her insistence, she remained in the band, shuttling back and forth between two countries to play the gigs and appear on important rehearsals. At that period Crooks & Straights were still at almost every live appearance in Croatia a subject of comparison with Plava Trava Zaborava, the other and much older Croatian country group, even if in terms of subgenres that both bands played, they had very little in common with their at the time still far more famous colleagues from Zagreb.  Greatest international success and release of the first album  By the beginning of 2004, ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú decided that it was their priority to first find a replacement for Aleksandar Grma≈° and bring the group sound back to the compact level they had built over more than four years prior to his departure. Therefore, the release of the album was temporarily relegated to the back burner. The replacement was found in Sandra Mladeniƒá who was at the time one of only two musicians in Croatia playing pedal steel. Truly enough, she did a decent job on the acoustic rhythm guitar, too. But her arrival in the group transformed the total sound into an even more traditional expression because from that point on, the arrangements sought to take advantage of the fact that now in the group there was an instrument which was relatively difficult to come by outside of country music. \\"Crooks & Straights‚Äù achieved their greatest success so far at the 23rd European country music contest, ‚ÄúPicnic Country ‚Äì Europa Contest‚Äù, held in MrƒÖgowo, Poland, from July 23 to 25, 2004. It was a festival with a long tradition, from all the way back into communist era, and after the Iron Curtain had fallen, it gradually grew to become some sort Eurovision Song Contest for country music. Upon their application, ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú received an official invitation to represent Croatia on the festival. The contest rules stipulated that two final songs in each act's half-an-hour programme represented the entry into the contest to be judged by an international jury. They required that one of the songs be an original arrangement of an existing American standard and the other one an original song, written by contestants themselves. The choice for ‚ÄúCrooks & Straights‚Äù was easy. \\"Singing the Blues\\" had already received raving reviews by independent European country music stations, so there was no need to search any further. As for the self-penned composition, maybe somewhat surprisingly, they chose ‚ÄûWhen I Called You Mine‚Äú, a song recorded well after the first album had already been finished and which had never been in plans as a possible addition to an already existing material. An epilogue to all this was the fact that among the pack of country bands from all across Europe ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú won the first prize and thereby, officially or unofficially, carried the title of the best European country band for the 2004/05 season. This win significantly helped them open the door of European country scene and soon invitations for live concerts started pouring in from all across the continent, mostly to take part on big country music festivals which are fairly numerous every year in Europe. At the same time, this success finally helped them to emerge from the shadow of ‚ÄúPlava Trava Zaborava‚Äù in Croatia and start creating their own identity in the eyes of an average music listener. And then it was finally time to release that album. After negotiations with three potential labels, they settled for ‚ÄûDancing Bear Records‚Äú, a major label from Zagreb. The decision was made largely on recommendation from one of the best European finger-style guitarists, Damir Haliliƒá Hal, who was signed himself by the same label. The album, titled ‚ÄûSo Little Left To Say‚Äú, was released in June 2005.  Release of the second album  Immediately before the festival in Poland, Gorana ƒåehiƒá had announced that she was pregnant and the group once again found themselves in a situation where they had to look for a replacement. Jo≈°ko Serdareviƒá found Nata≈°a Veljak, a seventeen-year-old violinist from one of the most famous musical families in Rijeka. Gorana ƒåehiƒá kept insisting that she would stay on in the group, so Nata≈°a Veljak was engaged only as a temporary stand-in, until Gorana's return. At first, the plan functioned relatively well. After a year of absence, Gorana ƒåehiƒá reclaimed her place in the band and again started coming from Italy to gigs and an odd rehearsal. Soon the group began recording songs for new album and the trend of writing their own compositions was taken a step further. It was now that original titles would make more than half of total material. However, towards the end of 2006, Gorana ƒåehiƒá was forced, mostly for family reasons, to leave, this time for good. So the band once again invited Nata≈°a Veljak to join them, this time on the permanent basis. She took the offer and as of the beginning of 2007 she's had a status of a full-time member. The timing of her return to the group fell exactly at the point when fiddle parts of the material for the second album were to be recorded. So practically overnight, she completely took over not only live appearances but also the identity of fiddle sound on the new album. Of course, that wouldn't have been possible if she had not already played with the band. The album for the first time featured a number of guests, among them many musicians for whom this was the first close encounter with country music. Most famous names were Damir Haliliƒá Hal on the acoustic solo guitar, Meri Tro≈°elj, famous singer-songwriter from Rijeka, Ivona Mariƒçiƒá, a member of the Rijeka all-girl pop quartet E.N.I. and Alba Nacinovich as solo vocalists, as well as Tomi Gra≈°o, a brilliant Croatian-Australian pedal steel wizard. The second album was released in May 2007, again by ‚ÄûDancing Bear Records‚Äú, and was titled ‚ÄûJust One Thing‚Äú. On it, the 2004 winner from Poland, ‚ÄúWhen I Called You Mine‚Äù, finally found its place. At the same time, this was the only song on the album still featuring Gorana ƒåehiƒá and Aleksandar Grma≈°.  Present line-up and release of the third album  For years the group successfully played both in Croatia and abroad, and so in October 2013 American Internet site ‚ÄûSaving Country Music‚Äú, dedicated to preserving traditional country music, listed them among 10 cool European country groups. However, with time differences started to emerge among the members with regard to future musical orientation. Sandra Mladeniƒá advocated commercialization of the sound and a shift towards lyrics in Croatian language. As the rest of the group did not agree to it, in October 2013 she quit the band. Instead of her, the group was joined by Ana Horvat who one year before had received the award as the best newcomer at the MIK, a local pop festival. Ana Horvat took over the lead vocals as the other members decided that there were already enough instrumentalists in the band and the group would best profit by building up on vocal front. Having resolved the issue of future artistic orientation, and after a pause of seven years, ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú finally began recording a new album. In line with the practice initiated on their previous release, a number of musicians outside the band joined in as guests. On the third album those are a pop singer Damir Ked≈æo, the old friend Tomi Gra≈°o from Sydney on pedal steel and a jazz keyboard player Zvjezdan Ru≈æiƒá from Opatija. However, the band came to a conclusion that ‚ÄûDancing Bear Records‚Äú were of less use to them in the past than they had hoped for and that the label had not treated them the way they desired. So, in the light of music industry digitalization, ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú decided to release their third album on their own. This album came out in June 2015 under the title ‚ÄûWay out of Town‚Äú. Since the arrival of Ana Horvat, the ‚ÄûCrooks & Straights‚Äú line-up has not changed anymore and as such they have been playing venues both in Croatia and abroad up until present time.

In the 1960s it was occupied by the Manchester College of Commerce. It has been a Grade II* listed building since 11 May 1972. Plaque commemorating the first meeting of the Trades Union Congress at the Mechanics' Institute in 1868 History Plaque commemorating the first meeting of the Co-operative Insurance Company at the Mechanics' Institute in 1867 Early years The institute, which was one of many, was established in Manchester on 7 April 1824 at the Bridgewater Arms hotel. Its purpose was to provide facilities for working men to learn the principles of science through part-time study. The original prospectus of the institute stated The most notable of the founders were William Fairbairn, Richard Roberts, George William Wood, George Philips, Joseph Brotherton and Benjamin Heywood. The last of these chaired the first meeting, became the leading patron and is often considered to be the founder. Many of these men shared similar interests, such as being Unitarians and members of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, aside from a desire to improve the commercial, industrial and technological life of Manchester. In this regard, Brotherton stood out as a deviation from the norm, for example in politics and religion. Others among the founders were James Murray, Thomas Hopkins, J. C. Dyer and Phillip Novelli, all of whom were later significant figures in the Anti-Corn Law League. In 1825 the first building in England expressly designed for use as a mechanics' institute was erected for its use in Cooper Street, off Princess Street, in Manchester.Frangopulo, N. J., ed. (1962) Rich Inheritance. Manchester: Education Committee; p. 85 This was demolished in the early 1970s. Although the original purpose of the institute was maintained, it was increasingly the case that emphasis was placed also on the wider social aspects of the organisation. Heywood's initial optimism regarding the moral upliftment of a significant number of working men through technical education was tempered by the realisation that tiredness and even employment status impeded its achievement. From around 1830, the scope of education was widened to include more elementary aspects, there were proposals to set up reading groups in surrounding areas that would be supplied with books from the institute's library, and also moves to encourage involvement in sports and in general social events. Mostly led from the top, although occasionally the result of explicit demands from its membership, the changes included the creation of a room for reading newspapers, a change in the type of lectures, which became less rigidly based on scientific topics, as also did the library stock, and events such as concerts, exhibitions and excursions played a more important role. Facilities for educating women and children were also introduced but, for example, a request to begin classes in history was rejected because of fears that it would lead to debates about politics. This institute organised the first City exhibition in 1837 and this led to a large number of similar exhibitions in English industrial towns and cities. By the 1840s, the exhibitions included thousands of casts, busts and masks relating to the fashionable subject of phrenology and were attracting over 100,000 visitors. The Manchester Phrenological Society used its facilities. Relocation The institute moved to the current building in 1855. The building was designed by J. E. Gregan in an Italian palazzo style and was Gregan's last work. It consists of three tall storeys with a basement and blind attic storey and is constructed of brick with stone dressings. \\"It set a standard for the scale of the commercial warehouses which were to follow, but the nobility and purity of the design sets it apart from its neighbours.\\" The inaugural meeting of the Trades Union Congress was held in the building, 2‚Äì6 June 1868. In 1882 it was decided to establish a technical school, the Technical School and Mechanics' Institution; it opened in September 1882. This was the beginning of the institution later known as UMIST. Present day As of 2002 the building contained archives from the National Labour History Museum, which were subsequently relocated with that museum.

It reaches long, and is found in a range of fresh and brackish waters. It feeds on algae and diatoms and is a major food of waterfowl. Description Hyalella azteca grows to a length of , with males being larger than females. Their colour is variable, but the most frequent hues are white, green and brown. Distribution Hyalella azteca is found across Central America, the Caribbean and North America, as far north as the Arctic tree line. It lives among vegetation in permanent bodies of freshwater, including lakes and rivers, extending into tidal fresh water, and freshwater barrier lagoons. It is \\"the most abundant amphipod of lakes [in North America]\\", with golf course ponds sometimes supporting large populations. Ecology In contrast to other species of Hyalella, H. azteca is extremely common and has wide ecological tolerances. It can tolerate alkaline waters and brackish waters, but cannot tolerate a pH lower (more acidic) than 6.0. The main foodstuffs of H. azteca are filamentous algae and diatoms, although they may also consume organic detritus. It cannot assimilate either cellulose or lignin, even though these biomolecules are a major component of the leaf litter. It can, however, assimilate 60%‚Äì90% of the bacterial biomass that it ingests. Hyalella azteca is an important food for many waterfowl. In Saskatchewan, 97% of the diet of female white-winged scoters was observed to be H. azteca, and it also makes up a significant part of the diet of lesser scaup. Life cycle Hyalella azteca passes through a minimum of nine instars during its development. Sexes can first be distinguished at the 6th instar, with the first mating occurring in the 8th instar. Subsequent instars, of which there may be 15‚Äì20, are considered adulthood. Uses Hyalella azteca are used in various aquatic bioassays. , (also called toxicity tests). [8] Because of their wide distribution, ease of captive reproduction, and its niche in lake sediments, Hyalella azteca are used in aquatic toxicology assays in sediments Hyalella azteca have been used to test bioaccumulation of different contaminants such as manufactured nanomaterials , pesticides , and metals . Taxonomic history Hyalella azteca was first described by Henri Louis Fr√©d√©ric de Saussure in 1858, under the name Amphitoe aztecus, based on material collected by Aztecs from a \\"cistern\\" near Veracruz, Mexico. It has also been described under several junior synonyms, including: *Hyalella dentata S. I. Smith, 1874 *Hyalella fluvialis Lockington, 1877 *Hyalella inermis S. I. Smith, 1875 *Hyalella knickerbockeri Bate, 1862 *Hyalella ornata Pearse, 1911 When Sidney Irving Smith erected the genus Hyalella in 1874, H. azteca was the only included species, and therefore the type species. The genus now includes dozens of species, mostly in South America. H. azteca is now thought to represent a species complex, since there is little gene flow between populations, and different morphotypes are known to coexist in some areas. Two local populations have been described as separate species ‚Äì Hyalella texana from the Edwards Plateau of Texas, and Hyalella montezuma from Montezuma Well, Arizona. In addition to being a species complex, laboratory work sequencing and analyzing the genome of lab populations of Hyalella azteca revealed Hyalella azteca shares characteristics of other model organisms. [8]. How these crustaceans interact with contaminants can provide insight about how other species will interact with those same contaminants. Genome Sequencing Project There is an ongoing Hyalella azteca genome sequencing project. This is part of a larger project being led by the Baylor college of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM-HGSC) ; in which 28 arthropod genomes are being sequenced. The sequencing of these genomes serves as a beginning to the larger i5k initiative, which has an end goal of sequencing 5,000 Arthropoda. Scientists looking to contribute to this research are able to nominate species to sequence, and download and share data to i5k website. Data can also be submitted to the Global Genome biodiversity workshop Biodiversity Repository. References 1] \\"Aquatic Invertebrates: Amphipods\\". The Nature of the Rideau River.

History=Formation Formed in the Fall of 2007 out of band Lye (and before that Aphasia), vocalist Brett Carruthers and bassist Stephany Seki began jamming with drummer Stu Dead, founder of Playdead Cult, a clothing brand and creative lifestyle house located in Toronto. Playdead's involvement in horror culture led to inviting the owner of Darkside horror shop's Dimitri Anastasakis to jam along on guitar. With this line up, they first publicly performed for Toronto's Queen Street Fire fundraiser alongside Billy Talent and The Creepshow.Canoe.ca article \\"Billy Talent, Alexis aid fire victims\\".CityTV article \\"Billy Talent To Headline Fundraiser For Queen West Fire Victims\\" . In 2007, the band self-produced the video for \\"Death on Wheels\\" alongside Frankenstein cheerleaders as part of the 2007 L'Or√©al Fashion Week, which was voiced by Martin Streek. \\"Death on Wheels\\" would initiate, The Death Girls, cheerleaders and super-fans that dance and sing at A.P.E events, sometimes by joining the band on stage. Notable Death Girls include models from the adult website Suicide Girls. A Primitive Evolution would later appear on the adult news channel, Naked News. \\"Death on Wheels\\" was also featured on Alan Cross's \\"Five Songs You Gotta Hear Today\\". In 2008, A Primitive Evolution played a Canadian Music Week showcase at The Bovine Sex Club. In 2008 the band continued writing and recording their debut album and worked on another music video for the song \\"Beyond True\\". In May they posted a demo for the song \\"Empty Holes\\", which would later also have a corresponding music video. Brett said in a 2010 interview that during these early years the band worked \\"just writing and figuring each other out\\". In the spring of 2009 the group founded the music festival VIVA LOS MUERTOS (2009 line-up featuring The Birthday Massacre, for whom Brett had performed live keyboards for during their Fall 2004 tour). The festival included \\"Major merch sales, dancing Playdead mascots and an eclectic long-weekend crowd that collectively offered plenty for the live eye\\". The festival had an \\"overwhelmingly good response\\", according to the band, hoping to further secure the creation and maintenance of a dynamic \\"Death Rock\\" scene in Toronto. Playdead Cult's \\"Moop\\", would continue to be the band's mascot and can be seen dancing on stage during the band's live performances. Later on in 2009, the band's self-produced debut video for \\"Death on Wheels\\", voiced by veteran Toronto radio DJ Martin Streek,CBC article \\"Toronto DJ Martin Streek dead at 45\\". caught the attention of the production crew for the vampire musical movie Suck.Rolling Stone article \\"Moby Sucks It Up Alongside Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper in Vampire Flick\\". This film debuted at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival featured the likes of Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper and Henry Rollins The film consequently utilized the band's rehearsal spaceSuck the Movie photo gallery . as a set for several scenes in the film. Finally at the end of 2009 the band would release their self-titled debut album. February 16, 2010, the band released their debut album digitally for worldwide distribution. In the summer of 2010, Adm Shedden, formerly of The Birthday Massacre and currently of Hunter Eves, joined to perform on live violin for acoustic shows. In 2010, the band continued playing shows in Toronto, Hamilton, Niagara Falls, Kitchener and Barrie. On February 15, 2011, the band posted on their Facebook profile that Scott Carruthers (Brett's cousin), would replace Dimitri Anastasakis on guitar. Dimitri had announced in the fall of 2010 also on their Facebook profile that he would be leaving the band due to pursue other goals important to his life. In 2011, the band recorded a new acoustic album, co-produced by John Wozniak, and welcomed back their friend, Adm Shedden for violin. The band encouraged fans to participate in its development by listening to rough mixes. The band documented the recording process with video, MP3's and photo updates on their official website and also announced that 20% of the proceeds would be donated to ShelterBox. In July, the band performed at Trash Fest USA, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A Primitive Evolution was recommended by George Stroumboulopoulos for Canadian Music Week 2011 in his Top 3 Buzz Bands out of the 800 that performed. In 2018 the band signed a record deal with Metropolis Records to release their album Becoming. Now acting as a three piece with Brett Carruthers, Stephany Seki and Stu Dead, this would be the band's debut release under an official label.https://www.rue-morgue.com/exclusive-new- video-from-a-primitive-evolutions-forthcoming-album-becoming/ 2019 would mark the band's first major North American Tour opening for labelmates PIG.

(2009) The band's debut album A.P.E., released in early December 2009, was produced by Matthew Von Wagner, (Crystal Castles, Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker, Alpha Galates) and Brett Carruthers. Wagner has worked alongside the likes of Joe Barresi and Bob Ludwig. A.P.E., according to the band, is grounded on a few common themes: the single \\"Death on Wheels\\" draws inspiration from classic grindhouse horror films, while others like \\"Dead End\\" are thinly veiled love songs. \\"War B.\\" explores political undertones and the Western view of war. Other songs on the album like \\"Beyond True\\" explore the romanticism of human interaction.

Structure and interior design  The Rapids Theatre rests on one of downtown Niagara Falls busiest commercial streets, Main Street, and is only five minutes away from the Canada‚ÄìUS border. It has a large parking lot in the rear of the building and sits next door to a brand new police station. It is a brick and concrete building, able to seat 800 people, 300 for table events, and up to 1,750 people standing for live concerts. Unlike the classic theatre-style seating that the Rapids used to have permanently installed, all chairs and tables in the facility can be removed and designed according to each show and event. There is a large tiled- floored front lobby with marble accessories that slopes up into the main portion of the theatre, which contains a large blue and white domed ceiling, a grand balcony for VIP seating, a concession stand, wood paneled floors, and columned walls. The interior design of the theatre has a vintage and historical look, adorned with crimson, gold, and black accents that match the original style of the 1920s. There is a large, maple-wood bar in the back center of the theatre and a bar on the left side of the balcony as well. Offices, meeting rooms, and dressing rooms are located on the upper level of the theatre. Two large projector screens hang to the right and left of the stage, directly in front of the elevated floor sections.  Other early movie showings  About a month after The Bellevue's 1921 opening, the theatre premiered the movie Handcuffs or Kisses featuring Elaine Hammerstein and a short film called, Figure It Out Yourself. On March 30, 1929, Shea's debuted The Wolf on Wall Street, starring George Bancroft . This was one of the first films shown with ‚Äú100% Talking Pictures equipped with RCA Photophone,‚Äù the latest in sound/voice technology at that time. An adult matinee ticket cost 25 cents. On November 26, 1930, the theatre held a week-long Thanksgiving special premier of ‚ÄúParamount‚Äôs comedy, Her Wedding Night, featuring Clara Bow.Advertisement. 26 Nov. 1930. Niagara Gazette. A reviewer for the Niagara Gazette described the actress as, ‚Äúthe famous red haired ‚Äòit‚Äô girl vies for honors with Charlie Ruggles, ‚ÄòSkeets‚Äô Gallagher, and Ralph Forbes.\\" Other movies shown by the theatre between 1921 and 1931 included, The Doctor‚Äôs Secret, The Canary Murder Case, Interference, The Night Club, The Wild Party, Chinatown Charlie, Eternal Love, Lummox, Nothing But The Truth, Lady of the Pavements, The Betrayal, The Letter, Coquette, The Dummy, She Goes to War, Alibi, and The Leatherneck.

This film featured opera prima donna Mary Garden, making her film debut at the then-lavish weekly salary of US$15,000. Other cast members include Lionel Adams, Crauford Kent, and Charles Trowbridge. This film is considered \\"one of the most colossal flops in movie history, both artistically and financially\\". Plot As described in a film magazine, Thais (Garden), a lustful dancer, tries to get Paphnutius (Revelle) under her power, but since he is a Christian he leaves to become a monk. Later, he returns to reclaim her soul and convinces the petted, spoiled, and lustrous Thais to cast off her riches, luxuries, and friends and to follow in his footsteps. Attempting to live solitary lives, the tortuous remembrance of their past lives causes them to forget everything and rush out into the desert. Thais is rescued by some sisters who take her to a nunnery. Paphnutius, unable to conquer his love for Thais, rushes to the nunnery only to find Thais dying the death of a saint. Her saintliness brings him a realization of his wrongs, and the film ends with his begging forgiveness for bowing to temptation and the strength to continue his work.

It implies that convex polyhedra with distinct shapes from each other also have distinct metric spaces of surface distances, and it characterizes the metric spaces that come from the surface distances on polyhedra. It is named after Soviet mathematician Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov, who published it in the 1940s. Statement of the theorem The surface of any convex polyhedron in Euclidean space forms a metric space, in which the distance between two points is measured by the length of the shortest path from one point to the other along the surface. Within a single shortest path, distances between pairs of points equal the distances between corresponding points of a line segment of the same length; a path with this property is known as a geodesic. This property of polyhedral surfaces, that every pair of points is connected by a geodesic, is not true of many other metric spaces, and when it is true the space is called a geodesic space. The geodesic space formed from the surface of a polyhedron is called its development. Four regular hexagons can be folded and glued to form the surface of a regular octahedron. In this example the edges of the hexagons do not fall along edges of the octahedron. The polyhedron can be thought of as being folded from a sheet of paper (a net for the polyhedron) and it inherits the same geometry as the paper: for every point p within a face of the polyhedron, a sufficiently small open neighborhood of p will have the same distances as a subset of the Euclidean plane. The same thing is true even for points on the edges of the polyhedron: they can be modeled locally as a Euclidean plane folded along a line and embedded into three-dimensional space, but the fold does not change the structure of shortest paths along the surface. However, the vertices of the polyhedron have a different distance structure: the local geometry of a polyhedron vertex is the same as the local geometry at the apex of a cone. Any cone can be formed from a flat sheet of paper with a wedge removed from it by gluing together the cut edges where the wedge was removed. The angle of the wedge that was removed is called the angular defect of the vertex; it is a positive number less than 2\\\\. The defect of a polyhedron vertex can be measured by subtracting the face angles at that vertex from 2. For instance, in a regular tetrahedron, each face angle is /3, and there are three of them at each vertex, so subtracting them from 2 leaves a defect of at each of the four vertices. Similarly, a cube has a defect of /2 at each of its eight vertices. Descartes' theorem on total angular defect (a form of the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem) states that the sum of the angular defects of all the vertices is always exactly 4\\\\. In summary, the development of a convex polyhedron is geodesic, homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to a sphere, and locally Euclidean except for a finite number of cone points whose angular defect sums to 4\\\\. Alexandrov's theorem gives a converse to this description. It states that if a metric space is geodesic, homeomorphic to a sphere, and locally Euclidean except for a finite number of cone points of positive angular defect summing to 4, then there exists a convex polyhedron whose development is the given space. Moreover, this polyhedron is uniquely defined from the metric: any two convex polyhedra with the same surface metric must be congruent to each other as three-dimensional sets. Limitations The polyhedron representing the given metric space may be degenerate: it may form a doubly-covered two-dimensional convex polygon (a dihedron) rather than a fully three-dimensional polyhedron. In this case, its surface metric consists of two copies of the polygon (its two sides) glued together along corresponding edges. The regular icosahedron has the same surface metric as a non-convex deltahedron in which one of its five-triangle pyramids is pushed in rather than protruding Although Alexandrov's theorem states that there is a unique convex polyhedron whose surface has a given metric, it may also be possible for there to exist non-convex polyhedra with the same metric. An example is given by the regular icosahedron: if five of its triangles are removed, and are replaced by five congruent triangles forming an indentation into the polyhedron, the resulting surface metric stays unchanged. The development of any polyhedron can be described concretely by a collection of two-dimensional polygons together with instructions for gluing them together along their edges to form a metric space, and the conditions of Alexandrov's theorem for spaces described in this way are easily checked. However, the edges where two polygons are glued together could become flat and lie in the interior of faces of the resulting polyhedron, rather than becoming polyhedron edges. (For an example of this phenomenon, see the illustration of four hexagons glued to form an octahedron.) Therefore, even when the development is described in this way, it may not be clear what shape the resulting polyhedron has, what shapes its faces have, or even how many faces it has. Alexandrov's original proof does not lead to an algorithm for constructing the polyhedron (for instance by giving coordinates for its vertices) realizing the given metric space. In 2008, Bobenko and Izmestiev provided such an algorithm. Their algorithm can approximate the coordinates arbitrarily accurately, in pseudo-polynomial time. Related results One of the first existence and uniqueness theorems for convex polyhedra is Cauchy's theorem, which states that a convex polyhedron is uniquely determined by the shape and connectivity of its faces. Alexandrov's theorem strengthens this, showing that even if the faces are allowed to bend or fold, without stretching or shrinking, then their connectivity still determines the shape of the polyhedron. In turn, Alexandrov's proof of the existence part of his theorem uses a strengthening of Cauchy's theorem by Max Dehn to infinitesimal rigidity. An analogous result to Alexandrov's holds for smooth convex surfaces: a two-dimensional smooth manifold whose total Gaussian curvature is 4 can be represented uniquely as the surface of a smooth convex body in three dimensions. This is a result of Stephan Cohn-Vossen from 1927. Aleksei Pogorelov generalized both these results, characterizing the developments of arbitrary convex bodies in three dimensions. Another result of Pogorelov on the geodesic metric spaces derived from convex polyhedra is a version of the theorem of the three geodesics: every convex polyhedron has at least three simple closed quasigeodesics. These are curves that are locally straight lines except when they pass through a vertex, where they are required to have angles of less than on both sides of them. The developments of ideal hyperbolic polyhedra can be characterized in a similar way to Euclidean convex polyhedra: every two-dimensional manifold with uniform hyperbolic geometry and finite area, combinatorially equivalent to a finitely-punctured sphere, can be realized as the surface of an ideal polyhedron.

First reported as a new species in 2007, it is known only from Kanagawa, Japan, where it fruits on dead fallen twigs in forests dominated by oak and chinquapin trees. Distinctive features of this species are found in its medium-sized, dark violet fruit bodies, with caps up to in diameter and slender stems that are about long. Microscopic characteristics include the amyloid spores (staining when treated with Melzer's reagent), the club-shaped cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) that are covered with one or more, knob-like, apical protuberances, the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), and the cylindrical, diverticulate caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem). Taxonomy, naming, and classification The mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 2000, and, along with seven other Mycena species, was reported as a new species in a 2007 publication. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words clari- (meaning \\"clear\\") and violacea (\\"violaceous\\"). The Japanese name is Shikon-sakuratake („Ç∑„Ç≥„É≥„Çµ„ÇØ„É©„Çø„Ç±). According to Takahashi, the amyloid spores, the cheilocystidia covered with one or more, knob-like, apical excrescences, the diverticulate elements in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and the diverticulate caulocystidia suggest that the species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes, as defined by the Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. Description Depending on the age of the mushroom, the cap can range in shape from conic to convex to bell- shaped to somewhat flattened in age; it reaches in diameter. It is sometimes shallowly umbilicate (with a small depression like a navel), radially grooved almost to the center, and somewhat hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or absorbs water). The cap surface is dry, and pruinose (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but this soon sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth. Initially, the cap color is dark violet, but it later fades to grayish-violet around the edges. The whitish flesh is up to 0.5 mm thick, and lacks any distinctive taste or odor. The slender stem is long by thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the stem, and hollow. Its surface is dry, pruinose over the entire length, and grayish-violet to dark violet in color. The base is covered with a white mycelial tomentum (a hairy covering of short, closely matted hairs). The gills are adnate (fused to the stem), and distantly spaced, with about 15‚Äì19 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to broad, thin, and the same color as the cap or paler. Microscopic characteristics The spores are broadly ellipsoid, smooth, colorless, amyloid (staining bluish to blue-black when treated with Melzer's reagent), thin-walled, and measure 8‚Äì9 by 5‚Äì6 ¬µm. The basidia are 40‚Äì60 by 10‚Äì12 ¬µm, club-shaped, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant, club-shaped, and measure 30‚Äì45 by 10‚Äì17 ¬µm. Their tips are covered with one or more, knob-like short excrescences that are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 12‚Äì21 ¬µm wide, cylindrical (but often somewhat inflated), smooth, and contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2‚Äì7 ¬µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth, or can be covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or pale brownish, and dextrinoid. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle is parallel, cylindrical, hyaline or brownish, and dextrinoid; it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48 ¬µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3‚Äì8 ¬µm wide, and similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 45‚Äì88 by 5‚Äì8 ¬µm, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or brownish, and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8‚Äì25 ¬µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections are present in the cap cuticle, the stem cuticle, the gill flesh, and at the basal septa of the basidia. Similar species Mycena clariviolacea is similar to the Brazilian species M. cerasina and the European M. diosma. Mycena cerasina, which belongs in the section Cerasinae of the genus Mycena, differs in having a grayish-purple cap and stem, and forming somewhat utriform (wineskin-shaped) to lageniform (flask-shaped), smooth cheilocystidia. Mycena diosma, classified in the section Calodontes, subsection Purae, may be distinguished microscopically from M. clariviolacea by its smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the cortical layer of cap and stem. Habitat and distribution Mycena clariviolacea is known only from Kanagawa, Japan.

First collected in 2000 and reported as a new species in 2007, it is known only from lowland oak-dominated forests in central Honshu in Japan. The small mushroom is characterized by its grooved, grayish-brown to violet-brown cap up to in diameter, and the slender grayish-brown to reddish-brown stem covered with minute, fine, soft hairs. The mushroom produces amyloid spores (spores that stain when treated with Melzer's reagent). Microscopic distinguishing features include the smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge and face, respectively) and the diverticulate elements in the outer layer of the cap and the stem. Taxonomy, naming, and classification Mycena lanuginosa was first collected by Haruki Takahashi in 2000, and published as a new species in 2007, along with seven other Japanese Mycena species. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word lanuginosa, meaning \\"lanugineous\\", referring to the hairy stem. The Japanese name for the mushroom is Keashi-haiirotake („Ç±„Ç¢„Ç∑„Éè„Ç§„Ç§„É≠„Çø„Ç±). The fungus is classified in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Qu√©l., as defined by Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. This section is the largest in the genus Mycena. Description The cap is in diameter, conical to convex to bell-shaped, and has distinct radial grooves that extend almost to the center. It is dry, and somewhat hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or absorbs water). The surface is initially pruinose (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap is dark brown at the center, and gradually changes to reddish-brown and finally to nearly white at the margin. The white flesh is up to 0.5 mm thick, and does not have any distinctive taste or odor. The slender stem is long by thick, cylindrical, attached to the center of the cap, hollow, and dry. The top portion of the stem is pruinose, while near the base the surface is covered with soft, fine hairs. The stem color is grayish- brown to reddish-brown near the top, changing to reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem base is covered with long, fairly coarse, whitish fibrils. The gills are narrowly attached to the stem, distantly spaced (12‚Äì18 gills reach the stem), up to 1.5 mm broad, thin, and whitish, with the gill edges the same color as the gill faces. Microscopic characteristics The spores are roughly ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, colorless, and measure 10‚Äì12 by 5.5‚Äì6.5 ¬µm. They are amyloid, meaning they will stain blue to black when treated with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35‚Äì42 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm, club-shaped, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases. The abundant cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are thin-walled, and measure 40‚Äì80 by 5‚Äì15 ¬µm. The smooth, colorless, and thin-walled spindle-shaped cells sometimes come to an abruptly tapering point; they form a sterile gill edge. Like the cheilocystidia, the pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are also spindle-shaped, abundant, smooth and thin-walled; they measure 63‚Äì102 by 8‚Äì15 ¬µm. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of smooth, thin-walled element hyphae that are 3‚Äì25 ¬µm wide, roughly cylindrical (often inflated), hyaline (translucent), and dextrinoid (turning reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2‚Äì6 ¬µm wide, and cylindrical. They can be either smooth, or covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled brownish diverticulae. The underlying hyphae have a parallel arrangement, and are hyaline or brownish, dextrinoid, with short and inflated cells that are up to 35 ¬µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae measuring 3‚Äì6 ¬µm wide. These hyphae, as well as the terminal cells (caulocystidia), have characteristics similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally arranged, cylindrical hyphae that are 6‚Äì20 ¬µm wide, smooth, hyaline, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections are present in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and at the basal septa of the basidia. Similar species M. lanuginosa closely resembles M. pilosella, a species originally described from Netherlands by Maas Geesteranus, and the European species M. zephirus; both are in the section Fragilipedes. Mycena pilosella differs in several microscopic characteristics: it has densely diverticulate elements of the cap cuticle; long, cylindrical caulocystidia that diverge at a right angle; and it does not have pleurocystidia. Mycena zephirus is distinct in forming a whitish cap, a stem that is initially minutely hairly but later becomes smooth, radish-like odor, ellipsoid to cylindrical spores, and cheilocystidia with branches near the tip. Habitat and distribution Mycena lanuginosa is known only from Kanagawa, in Honshu, Japan. Fruit bodies are found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves and twigs in lowland forests dominated by the oak species Quercus myrsinifolia and Q. serrata. Fruiting occurs from March to November.

First described as a new species in 2007, the mushroom is known only from Kanagawa, Japan, where it grows on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests dominated by oak. The mushroom has a whitish cap that reaches up to in diameter atop a slender stem long by thick. On the underside of the cap are whitish, distantly spaced gills that are narrowly attached to the stem. Microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the amyloid spores (turning bluish- black to black in the presence of Melzer's reagent), the pear-shaped to broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill edge) covered with a few to numerous, unevenly spaced, cylindrical protuberances, the lack of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), and the diverticulate hyphae in the outer layer of the cap and stem. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Taxonomy, naming, and classification The mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and reported as a new species in a 2007, along with seven other Japanese Mycenas. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word multiplicata, meaning \\"multiplicative\\". Its Japanese name is Keashi-ochiedatake („Ç±„Ç¢„Ç∑„Ç™„ÉÅ„Ç®„ÉÄ„Çø„Ç±).

It is often shallowly grooved toward the margin, dry, and somewhat hygrophanous (changing color when it loses or absorbs water). The cap surface is initially pruinose (appearing as if covered with a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap color is whitish, sometimes pale brownish at the center. The white flesh is up to 0.3 mm thick, and does not have any distinctive taste or odor. The slender stem is long by thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, and hollow. Its surface is dry, pruinose near the top, and covered with fine, soft hairs toward the base. It is whitish to grayish-violet near the top, gradually becoming dark violet below. The stem base is covered with long, fairly coarse, whitish fibrils. The gills are narrowly attached to the stem, distantly spaced (between 13 and 16 gills reach the stem), up to 1.7 mm broad, thin, and whitish, with the gill edges the same color as the gill faces. The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined. Microscopic characteristics The spores are ellipsoid, thin- walled, smooth, colorless, amyloid, and measure 8‚Äì9.5 by 4 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 24‚Äì31 by 6.5‚Äì7.5 ¬µm, club-shaped, four-spored, and have clamps at the basal septa. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant, pear-shaped to broadly club-shaped, and measure 17‚Äì28 by 11‚Äì20 ¬µm. They are covered with a few to numerous excrescences (outgrowths) that are 2‚Äì18 by 1‚Äì3 ¬µm, colorless, and thin-walled. The excrescences are unevenly spaced, simple to somewhat branched, cylindrical, and straight or curved. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in this species. The hymenophoral (gill-producing) tissue is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 7‚Äì20 ¬µm wide, cylindrical (but often inflated), smooth, hyaline (translucent), and dextrinoid (staining reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3‚Äì5 ¬µm wide, cylindrical, and covered with simple to highly branched colorless diverticulae that have thin walls. The layer of hyphae underneath the cap cuticle have a parallel arrangement, and are hyaline and dextrinoid, and made of short and inflated cells that are up to 52 ¬µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2‚Äì10 ¬µm wide, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or pale violet, dextrinoid, and thin-walled.

First described as a new species in 2007, the fungus is known only from Kanagawa, Japan, where it grows on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests. The mushroom's dull violet to grayish-violet cap, initially covered with a fine whitish powder, becomes smooth as it matures, and eventually reaches a diameter of up to . The stem is slender, up to long, and is covered with stiff white hairs at the base. Underneath the cap are distantly spaced pale brownish gills that are narrowly attached to the stem. Microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the weakly amyloid spores (turning bluish to black when stained with Melzer's reagent), the club-shaped cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) featuring one or more short knob-like protuberances, the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and the absence of clamp connections. Taxonomy, naming, and classification The species was first collected in Japan by Hiraku Takahashi in 1999, and reported as a new species in a 2007 publication. The specific epithet is the Latin word mustea, meaning \\"fresh\\". The Japanese name is Sumire-ashinagatake. The infrageneric classification of the fungus is unclear, and depends on what taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., as defined by the Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic emphasis is placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more appropriate in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Qu√©l. Description The cap is conical to convex to bell- shaped, occasionally with a low and broad umbo, and reaches in diameter. When moist, it is partly translucent, and grooves corresponding to the position of the gills under tha cap can be seen. The surface is somewhat hygrophanous‚Äîit changes color as it loses or absorbs moisture. The surface is initially pruinose‚Äîcovered with what appears to be a fine white powder (remnants of the universal veil that covered the immature fruit body)‚Äîbut this soon sloughs off, leaving it smooth. The cap surface is a dull violet color when young, then becomes somewhat paler near the margin. The flesh is up to 0.5 mm thick, white, and lacks any distinctive odor and taste. The slender stem is long by thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, and hollow. Its surface is dry, dull violet to grayish-violet over the entire length. Like the cap surface, it is initially entirely pruinose, but becomes smooth in maturity. The base of the stem is covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The gills are narrowly attached to the stem, and distantly spaced, with between 15 and 19 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.2 mm broad, thin, and pale brownish. The gill edges are pruinose, and the same color as the gill faces. Microscopic characteristics The spores are roughly ellipsoid and measure 11‚Äì12 by 6‚Äì7 ¬µm. They are smooth, colorless, inamyloid to weakly amyloid, and thin-walled. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 28‚Äì37 by 8‚Äì10 ¬µm, club-shaped, and mostly four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are club-shaped, abundant, and measure 30‚Äì45 by 8‚Äì11 ¬µm. They form a sterile gill edge. Near their tips they have one or more short knob-like excrescences (outgrowths) that are colorless, and thin-walled. M. mustea does not have cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). The hymenophoral tissue is made of hyphae that are 5‚Äì16 ¬µm wide, cylindrical (often somewhat inflated) with thin walls, smooth, colorless, and inamyloid. The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2‚Äì6 ¬µm wide, cylindrical, and covered with scattered, warty or finger-like hyaline (translucent) thin-walled diverticulae. The layer of hyphae under the cap cuticle are parallel, hyaline or pale violet, dextrinoid (turning reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent), and contain short and inflated cells that are up to 25 ¬µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over thin- walled hyphae that are 2‚Äì6 ¬µm wide, cylindrical, smooth, and hyaline or pale violet. The stem tissue is made of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8‚Äì15 ¬µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections are absent in all tissues. Similar species Mycena mustea is similar to the North American species M. umbrinovinosa, which is distinguished by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M. urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced warts, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M. fonticola, a species described concurrently with M. mustea. Unlike that of M. fonticola, the cap of M. mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M. fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers. Habitat and distribution Mycena mustea is known only from Kanagawa, Japan. The mushroom is found growing solitary to scattered on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests dominated by the hornbeam carpinus (Carpinus tschonoskii) and the Chinese evergreen oak (Quercus myrsinaefolia).

First collected in 2000 and reported as a new species in 2007, it is known only from Kanagawa, Japan, where it grows on the floor of oak forests. The dark brown irregularly wrinkled cap measures up to in diameter. The cap is supported by a thin stem up to long, which is covered at the base by a whitish hairlike growth, and attached to white, cord-like rhizomorphs‚Äîaggregations of mycelium that resemble plant roots. The underside of the cap features thin, distantly spaced grayish gills that have distinct veins running between them. At a microscopic level, distinguishing characteristics include the inamyloid spores (turning dark blue to black when stained with Melzer's reagent), the club-shaped cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) with finger-like appendages, the diverticulate cells in the outer layer of cap and stem, and the presence of clamp connections. Taxonomy, naming, and classification Mycena nidificata was first collected in 2000 by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi, and reported as new along with seven other Mycenas in a 2007 publication. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word nidificata, meaning \\"nidificate\\"‚Äî\\"to make a nest\\". Its Japanese name is Yamiiro-kunugitake („É§„Éü„Ç§„É≠„ÇØ„Éå„ÇÆ„Çø„Ç±). According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and the dark pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best classified in the section Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white spore prints and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within the section. Description The cap is initially conical to convex to bell-shaped, then flattened in age, ultimately reaching in diameter. The center of the cap is irregularly wrinkled to pitted, but less so toward the grooved margin. It is hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, initially pruinose (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The color is blackish-brown at the center, dark brown to reddish-brown farther outward, and becoming much paler at the margin; sometimes the cap is evenly dark brown. The flesh is up to 1 mm thick and white, and does not have any distinctive taste and odor. The stem is long by wide, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, central, slender, and hollow. The stem surface is dry, pruinose over the entire length, and does not become smooth with age. It is pale brownish at the top, and gradually becomes dark brown toward the base. The base is covered with a white mycelial hairlike growth (a tomentum) that is attached to white cord-like rhizomorphs on the substratum. The gills are fused to the stem, and distantly spaced, with between 15 and 18 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 2.5 mm broad, thin, grayish, and have distinct veins running between them. The gill edges are the same color as the gill faces. Microscopic characteristics The spores are roughly ellipsoid and measure 8‚Äì11 by 5‚Äì6 ¬µm. They are smooth, colorless, inamyloid, and thin-walled. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 28‚Äì35 by 7‚Äì8 ¬µm, club-shaped, and mostly four-spored. The abundant cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measure 30‚Äì45 by 10‚Äì15 ¬µm, and form a sterile gill edge. They have several irregularly cylindrical to knob-like apical appendages measuring 3‚Äì11 by 2‚Äì5 ¬µm, which are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in M. nidificata. The hymenophoral (hymenium-bearing) tissue is made of smooth, thin-walled hyphae that are 6‚Äì26 ¬µm wide, cylindrical (but often inflated), and contain brownish pigment in the cytoplasm. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning they will turn reddish to reddish-brown in the presence of Melzer's reagent. The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3‚Äì10 ¬µm wide, cylindrical. The hyphae are smooth or covered with scattered, warty or finger-like diverticulae. Under the cap cuticle is a layer of parallel hyphae containing cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The hyphae are dextrinoid, and contain short and inflated cells that are up to 40 ¬µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae 3‚Äì8 ¬µm wide, which are similar in appearance to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are relatively sporadic; they are cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless, thin-walled, and measure 45‚Äì60 by 4‚Äì8 ¬µm. The stem tissue is composed of longitudinally arranged, cylindrical hyphae that are 10‚Äì25 ¬µm wide, dextrinoid, smooth, and have cytoplasmic brownish pigment. Clamp connections are present in the stem tissues, and at the septa at the bases of the basidia. Similar species Mycena granulifera, a species originally described from Brazil, is comparable to M. nidificata in having inamyloid spores, club-shaped cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae. M. granulifera differs in forming a whitish, wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. Mycena nidificata also bears some resemblance to the European species M. flos-nivium, which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and an absence of cord-like rhizomorphs. Habitat and distribution Mycena nidificata is known only from Kanagawa, Japan. The mushroom is found growing solitary or scattered, on dead fallen twigs in forests dominated by the oak species Quercus castanopsis. Fruiting occurs from May to September.

It was originally broadcast on October 27, 2010, on the ABC network in the United States. The episode was written by Jeffrey Richman and directed by Michael Spiller and was based on an idea by cast member Eric Stonestreet. The episode follows Claire's love for Halloween, which leads her to transform the Dunphy residence into a haunted house for trick-or-treaters. Cameron cannot shake a childhood trauma related to the holiday and Mitchell has a terrible day at work. Gloria acts weird after Jay and Manny tease her about her accent. \\"Halloween\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Halloween\\" became the most viewed episode of the series and tied for the series' highest rated episode among adults between ages 18 and 49. It later became the second highest rated show for the week as well as the week's highest rated scripted program. This episode received multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, and won for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for Michael Spiller. Jesse Tyler Ferguson was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in this episode. Plot At the Dunphy house, Phil (Ty Burrell) learns that his neighbor, Jerry (Matt Besser) has divorced. Phil is initially sad for Jerry, but soon fears that the same thing might happen to him and his wife, Claire (Julie Bowen). Phil soon assumes Claire's concentration on completing the haunted house is a sign that she no longer loves him. He soon does the opposite of what Jerry did that caused the demise of his marriage, like being spontaneous, with all of Phil's attempts failing. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) also gets excited when he learns that his new law firm allows employees to wear Halloween costumes, and decides to wear a Spider-Man costume to work. Unfortunately, he learns too late that \\"only tools and douches wear costumes\\". He quickly puts on a suit over the costume, thinking that he can change out of the costume later, but he is pulled into several meetings and is unable to get the chance to take it off. Meanwhile, Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) gets offended by Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Jay (Ed O'Neill) correcting her accent so she starts acting weird and talking differently. At Claire's finished haunted house, everything goes wrong with Jay late at activating the effects, Gloria speaking in her \\"English\\" voice, Alex poorly imitating being held prisoner and Cameron still talking about his \\"traumatic\\" Halloween story. After two failed attempts at scaring trick-or-treaters, Claire becomes furious and walks out of the haunted house. Phil then asks her if she is tired of him, to which she responds that they are happily stuck together as a couple. While they talk, the rest of the family finishes the haunted house perfectly, to Claire and Phil's happiness. Production Eric Stonestreet, who portrays Cameron Tucker on the show, pitched the idea for a Halloween themed episode. \\"Halloween\\" was directed by Michael Spiller and was the first episode Jeffrey Richman wrote for the series since joining the writing staff at the beginning of the second season. \\"Halloween\\" aired on October 27, 2010 as the first Halloween-themed episode and the 30th episode overall for the series. Parts of the episode were filmed on October 6, 2010, and October 8, 2010. The idea for the episode was pitched by cast member Eric Stonestreet who suggested that there should be a Modern Family episode about Halloween. The series' producers liked the idea so much that they produced \\"Halloween\\". Many of the cast members costumes were revealed on the first day of filming by script coordinator Clint McCray through Twitter. Ferguson later said in an interview that: > \\"The Spider-Man scene from the Halloween episode was my favorite to shoot > thus far for the sheer fact that I was scaling down a wall in a Spider-Man > costume. I will never in my life be cast in a movie where I am able to wear > a super-hero costume and perform my own stunts. It was like I got to live a > dream for a day.\\" Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Halloween\\" was viewed by an estimated 13.143 million households and received a Nielsen rating of 7.8 rating/12% share, meaning that 7.8% of American households watched the episode and that 12% of all televisions in use at the time were watching it. The episode also received a 5.1 rating/14% share among adults between ages 18 and 49. The episode marked a nine percent rise in the 18-49 demographic from the previous episode, \\"Unplugged\\", becoming the most viewed episode of the series in total viewers and the highest rated episode in the 18-49 demographic, tying with \\"The Old Wagon\\". The episode also became the highest rated scripted program and the second highest rated program overall for the week it premiered among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Added with the DVR viewers, the episode received a 6.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, adding a 1.4 rating to the original viewership. Reviews The episode received mostly positive reviews. Donna Bowman from The A.V. Club compared \\"Halloween\\" to the highly praised episode \\"Fizbo\\", saying \\"\\"Halloween\\" reminded me very much of season one‚Äôs 'Fizbo', especially in the chaotic climax where everyone contributes their particular insecurity or neurosis.\\" The A.V. Club later named it, along with \\"Fifteen Percent\\" and \\"Truth Be Told\\", the best 2010 episodes of Modern Family. James Poniewozik of Time gave the episode a positive review calling it \\"fine\\", but not his \\"favorite\\". He named Gloria's storyline his favorite, saying \\"Sofia Vergara's exaggerated, passive-aggressive American accent was brilliant\\". Joel Keller of TV Squad praised the development of Claire, and felt that her \\"losing it\\" helped \\"soften her character.\\" Joye Eng of TV Guide named Gloria's storyline the best moment of the week the episode premiered. She named Gloria's \\"reaction shot when he inevitably unwraps a package of tiny Jesus figurines\\" and \\"Sofia Vergara's version of a typical American accent\\" the most \\"fun\\". Kara Klenc of the same website called it a \\"great episode\\". It was later named it the eleventh best television episode of 2010 by the website. On the other hand, Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a negative review. He wrote: \\"The unimaginatively titled \\"Halloween\\" was probably the least hilarious installment to date of Modern Family's second season\\". He also criticized the ending to Cameron's story, saying \\"while I expected the big reveal would leave me howling, when it finally came ('I wet my pants!'), I didn't even crack a smile.\\" Awards and nominations \\"Halloween\\" received several Primetime Emmy Award nominations. The episode was nominated for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series, Outstanding Picture Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. The episode eventually won for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for Michael Spiller. Ferguson, who submitted this episode, was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, but lost to co-star Burrell.

The stations were established between 1981 and 2010 and have received government funding since 1989 to broadcast community programming and provide facilities, training and on-air time for individuals and community groups to produce programming. In addition to government funding conditions, the stations also have an individual and collective mandate to broadcast programmes for people of a wide range of particular religions, cultures, languages, ages and sexualities. Stations operate independently and locally, with each station expected to make decisions on programming and scheduling by internal consensus. In total, they produce content in at least 40 different languages. The member stations currently serve Auckland, Waikato, Taranaki, Hawke's Bay, Manawatu, Wairarapa, Kapiti, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago and Southland. Some community stations have powerful frequencies, while others are low-power stations with a small local reach. History=Establishment The stations of the Access Radio Network were established between 1981 and 2010: * April 1981: Wellington Access Radio * March 1986: Arrow FM Wairarapa * 1987: Planet FM Auckland * 28 February 1988: Plains FM Canterbury * 1990: Otago Access Radio * 1992: Free FM Hamilton * 1994: Fresh FM Nelson * 1995: Radio Kidnappers * 1996: Coast Access Radio (Kapiti) * 1998: Access Manawatu * 2010: Access Radio Taranaki The association was set up in the early 1990s following a meeting between community station managers and New Zealand on Air officials in Wellington. It was the first opportunity many station managers had to meet each other and share the challenges each station had faced, including operating on limited resources, relying on volunteer support, serving diverse communities or operating from remote locations. Funding In 1989, the Broadcasting Act set up the Broadcasting Commission - known publicly as New Zealand On Air - to fund New Zealand content for both mainstream and minority audiences. Funding of access radio has always been a part of that function, and the ongoing funding of the Association member stations remains a core component of the Commission's Community Broadcasting Strategy. A government funding pool of approximately $2 million is now allocated annually for the eleven stations to produce programming for women, youth, children, ethnic and other minorities and people with disabilities in accordance with section 36(c) of the Broadcasting Act. Individual station funding is allocated on a four-tier system based on audience reach, with each station receiving between $110,000 and $220,000 in annual, contestable and publicly transparent funding rounds. Auckland's Planet FM is in the highest- funded Tier One; and Free FM Hamilton, Wellington Access Radio and Plans FM Canterbury are Tier Two. Radio Kidnappers in Hawke's Bay, Access Manawatu, Fresh FM in Nelson, Otago Access Radio and Radio Southland are Tier 3; and Arrow FM in Wairarapa and Coast Access FM in Kapiti are on the lowest-funded Tier 4. National operations The association has established itself as the national lobbying and resourcing organisation of community radio stations and aims to promote, develop, foster and support the community access model. It is affiliated with and emulates the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia and the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters but has no domestic affiliations. Instead, it has become a self-support network, allowing the stations to share resources and ideas. Each year, the association holds an annual general meeting at a member station and appoints a chair, secretary and treasury with each station allocated a single vote every year. The association has remained non-profit and consensus-driven, with discussions taking place in face-to-face meetings, teleconferences and via email. However, while the association can introduce policies, it cannot dictate the content of individual community radio stations. Awards Access stations received awards for their tributes to Nelson Mandela. Community stations have picked up several awards at the annual New Zealand Radio Awards since community radio stations were allowed into the event in 2002. The first awards went to Wellington Access for Terry Shaw's Songwriting Show and John E. Joyce's Basically Speaking and This is Jazz USA. Later winners have included Viva Latinoamerica (Fresh FM), Jazz Bros (Coast Access), Like Minds Like Mine (Arrow FM), Six Degrees Music Show (Fresh FM) and Candela (Community Radio Hamilton). Fresh FM music programme The World of Leopold Bloom - the work of Leopold Bloom and Matt Budd - has received more radio awards and finalist placings than other community radio show. In 2014, a Leopold Bloom tribute special on Nelson Mandela and the music of South Africa won best community access programme, and the South Africa New Zealand Association Mandela Memorial Programme on Planet FM won best spoken programme. Edward Swift won best new broadcaster in 2010 for his work on the morning show Plains FM and has since gone on to work for Newstalk ZB and Radio Sport.

Free FM Hamilton Free FM broadcasts on 89.0 FM in Hamilton. It began as AM1206 in 1992 and was renamed Community Radio Hamilton 1206 AM in 2004. After raising more than $100,000 to expand its reach and lobbying the Government for support, the station was granted a new FM frequency in October 2011 when the Ministry for Culture and Heritage re- designated the 89.0 mHz frequency for general community use. The station rebranded to Free FM and organised events in several Waikato towns to recognise its transition to FM in October 2012. The new full-power frequency allows the station to reach a much wider area than its previous AM and low- power frequencies, with coverage north of Huntly, south of Tokoroa, east of Te Aroha and west of Raglan. The station now has more than a hundred volunteers and produces over eighty shows every week. It station is operated by Waikato Community Broadcasting Charitable Trust, which supplements Government funding with grants from community trusts and the Rotary Club. Plains FM Canterbury Christchurch-based Plains FM has been broadcasting in Canterbury on 96.9FM since 29 February 1988. Part of the station's schedule is dedicated to programmes for under-represented groups like women, children and young people, and ethnic minorities - including programmes in at least 18 migrant languages. Fee-paying groups are provided with training and facilities to produce programmes for local communities and specific interests. At other times, the station follows an adult album alternative format, with swing, blues, roots/acoustic, alt country, soul, world and New Zealand music. Plains FM communicated emergency messages in several languages after the September 2010 Darfield earthquake, but its Civil Defence role was initially limited after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The Plains FM building was green-stickered and safe to enter, but staff were prevented from crossing the red zone cordon to access broadcast equipment for 5 weeks. Station management continue to work with local agencies and Civil Defence to develop their role for all future disaster response programmes. Plains FM also obtained a grant from Lions Club International for an onsite generator and updated their technical infra-structure. Key volunteers will be used in disaster reporting in the future in order to keep local CALD communities informed. Access Radio Taranaki Access Radio Taranaki broadcasts in Taranaki on 104.4 FM. Almost 120 community groups were consulted and over 75 had signed up for broadcast hours before Access Radio Taranaki could make a case for New Zealand on Air funding and begin broadcasting in July 2010. A limited access service operated as far back as 1981, when Radio New Zealand allowed community radio programmes to be carried by Parliamentary broadcaster 2YB on Saturday mornings. In its modern form, at least 40 percent of the station's funding comes from local community trusts, council grants and private donations. Access Radio Taranaki invites a broad range of groups to make programmes, and refuses to exercise any editorial censorship or oversight. It is the only radio station in the southern hemisphere with a radio show hosted by a young person with Down Syndrome, and gears its musical playlist to the tastes of audiences at different times of the day. Local community boards south of Mount Taranaki have funded mobile broadcast technology to allow South Taranaki schools and cultural, medical and special interest groups to prerecord their own radio programmes. Radio Kidnappers Radio Kidnappers broadcasts on 1431 AM across the Hawke's Bay and 104.7 FM in Napier. It has broadcast in Hawke's Bay on AM since 1995 and FM since the early 2000s, reaching most of the region from Wairoa and Mahia in the north and Waipawaa and Waipukurau in the south. It is also available in Dannevirke, Gisborne and Taupo at night or during certain atmospheric conditions. The station includes many non- mainstream and non-professional radio programmes, including migrant language shows, school debating competitions, and political debates. Access Manawatu Access Manawatu broadcasts on 999 AM in Manawatu.

The station is owned by Manawatu Access Radio Charitable Trust and receives funding from Palmerston North City Council, Destination Manawatu and other funding bodies. In addition to providing training, support, studios and remote broadcast facilities for programme-makers, Access Manawatu offers community event assistance, organises a summer concert series, provides summer school and school leaver radio training, and broadcasts the work of local musicians. Arrow FM Wairarapa Arrow FM broadcasts on 92.7 FM in the Wairarapa. Since being set up on 2 March 1986, Arrow FM has gone from three-hour weekly broadcast to a nonstop-operation. Over the years it has featured programmes from Rape Crisis, Trade Aid, the local library, film society, schools and minority groups. With a limited number of shows, New Zealand music takes up most of the station's airtime. Masterton District Council, Carterton District Council and various funding bodies support the station's operation. Coast Access Kapiti Coast Access broadcasts on 104.7 FM on the Kapiti Coast. A small group of volunteers formed Coast Access Radio in 1996, and began broadcasting during the Christmas of 1997 1512 kHz (AM) initially from a studio in Waikanae Museum. The station moved into a Community Centre in Aputa House and began leasing the 96.7 FM frequency off Rhema Media, before it was granted the Crown-reserved 104.9 FM frequency in 2004. Coast Access adjusted to 104.7 FM in 2012, and shifted into a new purpose-built studio in 2014. Coast Access broadcasts a live weekday breakfast show, Friday afternoon show and Friday drive show, and has received more than 20 finalist placings in the New Zealand Radio Awards for its minority programmes.

Initially a Tory, he switched to supporting the Whigs after 1715. He held no Office of State, nor any commercial directorship of significance,Hayton, David (ed.), The House of Commons 1690-1715, vol.2,p.526. \\"Richard Child\\" but is remembered chiefly as the builder of the now long-demolished Palladian \\"princely mansion\\"\\"Princely Mansion\\", description used in the 1822 auction sale catalogue Wanstead House, one of the first in the style constructed in Britain. In the furnishing of his mansion Child became the main patron of the Flemish painter Old Nollekens. He died in March 1750 aged 70 at Aix-en-Provence, France, and was buried on 29 May 1750 at Wanstead.http://www.thePeerage.com \\"Richard Tynley (sic) person no.24633\\" Family background Richard Child was baptised at Wanstead Church of the Virgin Mary on 5 February 1680, the third son of the wealthy Sir Josiah Child (1630‚Äì1699) Governor of the East India Company, who had been created 1st Baronet of Wanstead in 1678, by his third wife Emma Barnard (died 16 October 1725), daughter of Sir Henry Barnard, of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, Turkey merchant of London.thePeerage.com He was appointed as residuary legatee and executor under the will of his father, whose death occurred before Richard's majority. Richard then on 12 February 1700 petitioned Parliament for a bill, to vest certain lands in trustees ,so that settlements made upon the marriage of his half-brother Josiah could be honoured.Hayton, 2002, p.526 In 1703 Richard married Dorothy Glynne, daughter and co-heiress of John Glynne, younger son of Sir John Glynne (died 1666), Lord Chief Justice, of Henley Park, Surrey, and Dorothy Tylney, daughter of Francis Tylney of Tylney Hall, Rotherwick, Hampshire. On 20 January 1704 he succeeded his half-brother Sir Josiah Child, 2nd Baronet, to the Baronetcy and to the Child manor of Wanstead, Essex, lying 6 miles north-east of the City of London. He also inherited a fortune of ¬£4,000 per annum, which brought his total income to ¬£10,000.Hayton, D. (ed), 2002, p.526. Building of Wanstead House The Palladian Wanstead House in 1771; commissioned in 1715 by Sir Richard Child from a design by Colen Campbell. By the time of its completion in 1722 Child had been created 1st Viscount Castlemaine. In 1731 he was created Earl Tylney. Illustration from Nathaniel Spencer, The Complete English Traveller, London 1771 One of a pair of surviving piers of the entrance gate to Wanstead House, with monogram of Richard Child Following the first Baronets's death, his heir Josiah had leased Wanstead to his half-brother Richard. Coming into full possession of it, Sir Richard Child, 3rd Baronet, commissioned in 1715 the Scottish architect Colen Campbell to build a palatial Palladian mansion to replace the former manor house. By the time of its completion in 1722 Wanstead House had provided Child with a grand seat befitting his newly obtained status as Viscount Castlemaine, a creation of 1718. Political career Sir Richard Child stood unsuccessfully as a Tory candidate for Essex at the 1705 general election, with the backing of Henry Compton, Bishop of London. At the 1708 general election, he was returned unopposed as Tory Member of Parliament for Maldon, Essex. During this session he acted as a teller for the minority in favour of an adjournment during the debate on the Whitchurch election, which had been fought by his wife's relative, Frederick Tylney. The House resolved that Tylney had not been duly elected. He also voted against the impeachment of Dr Henry Sacheverell. At the 1710 general election, Child was elected Tory MP for Essex on behalf of the Church Party, topping the poll. Over 90% of his vote consisted of \\"Plumpers\\", indicating his high popularity. He was a member of the October Club and in 1711 he was listed as one of the \\"Worthy Patriots\\" who had drawn attention to the mismanagement of the previous government. He voted for the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. At the 1713 general election, he was returned unopposed for Essex, again with Compton‚Äôs support. He had become unpopular in the House, and Robert Harley referred to him as a jobber who had ‚Äòmade a prey of the poor‚Äô. In spite of this and the Hanoverian succession which favoured the Whigs, Child was again elected MP for Essex at the 1715 general election. Returned as a Tory he began to support the Whig government, voting for the Septennial Bill in 1716. His main concern was to obtain a peerage and although he purchased an Irish peerage from the Duchess of Munster in 1715, he had to wait until 1718 before he was created Baron Newtown and Viscount Castlemaine. As these were Irish peerages, he was still able to sit in the House of Commons. He voted for the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts, and against the Peerage Bill in 1719. He was defeated in the contest for Essex at the 1722 general election but was returned unopposed for Essex at the 1727 general election. He voted consistently for the government and by Act of Parliament on 13 June 1733 assumed name of Tylney. At the 1734 general election, he stood down from parliament in favour of his son John Tylney who failed to be elected. First elevation to the Peerage In June 1711 a rumour emerged that Child was about to purchase a peerage for ¬£10,000 from the administration under Queen Anne, which prompted Thomas Viscount Windsor to complain: \\"that's beginning too soon to be like the Duchess of Marlborough, to do anything for money, making a man that's no gentleman a lord\\".Hayton, D. 2002, p.526 The rumour of a peerage resurfaced in the winter of 1711 and in March 1713, and proved true when on 24 April 1718, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Newtown, in the County of Donegal, and Viscount Castlemaine, in the County of Kerry. It is not known whether he ever took his seat in the Irish House of Lords; the title was designed only to give social status. The title of Castlemain was somewhat discredited, having last been granted in 1661 to Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemain, whose wife was Barbara Villiers, mistress of King Charles II, to whom the King wished to give status. The patent confined the remainder to the heirs of her body, not his. Palmer himself never took his seat in the Irish Parliament, and had died in 1705. Inheritance of Tylney estates In 1730 Child's wife Dorothy Glynne inherited the Tylney estates in Hampshire from her cousin Ann Tylney (died 5 Feb. 1729/30), Lady Craven, wife of William Craven, 3rd Baron Craven (died 1739), and daughter and sole heiress of Frederick Tylney (died 1725)Collins' Peerage, 1735, vol.3, p.306, Baron Craven (who had built Tylney Hall in 1700), by Ann, daughter of George Pitt (died 1745) of Stratfield Saye, Hampshire. Lady Craven's daughter had predeceased her in 1725 and ‚Äî although Lord and Lady Craven had obtained an Act of Parliament authorising their descendants to bear both their surnames (Craven and Tylney)Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1723 (10 Geo. 1). c. 13 ‚Äî ultimately their marriage was without surviving issue. Ann Tylney, Lady Craven was buried at Binley, Coventry. Tylney family of Hampshire In 1629 Richard Tylney purchased the manor of Rotherwick from Richard More. Tylney was already by then a local landowner. His descendant Frederick Tylney, who stood as MP for Whitchurch in January 1708, built a great mansion on the estate in 1700, called Tylney Hall. It was rebuilt in 1898 in the Victorian style, and is now a country hotel. A marble monument exists in the north aisle of Rotherwick church to Frederick Tylney (d. 1725), erected by his widow Anne, which displays their combined coats of arms, of which Tylney is: \\"Argent, a chevron between 3 griffons' heads erased gules\\".Victoria County History, Hampshire, vol.4, pp.99-101: Tylney in Rotherwick Parish. Creation of Tylney Earldom On 11 June 1731, Viscount Castlemaine was created Earl Tylney, of Castlemaine in the County of Kerry, a title in the Peerage of Ireland. On 13 June 1733 the Earl assumed by Act of Parliament the surname, for himself and his heirs, of Tylney in lieu of his patronymic, to meet a requirement of his wife's inheritance.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1732 (6 Geo. 2). c. 2Hayton, D., 2002, p.526 His eldest surviving son Richard, styled from the creation of his father's earldom in 1731 by the courtesy title (his father's lesser title) of Viscount Castlemaine, died in 1734 without issue, predeceasing his father.

Hogarth Earl Tylney, of Castlemaine in the County of Kerry, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 11 June 1731 for Richard Child, 1st Viscount Castlemaine. The Child family descended from the merchant, economist and colonial administrator Josiah Child, who on 16 July 1678 was created a baronet, of Wanstead in the County of Essex, in the Baronetage of England. The first Baronet was succeeded by his son from his second marriage, Sir Josiah Child, 2nd Baronet. The second baronet died young and childless, though engaged to be married, in 1704, having briefly represented Wareham in the House of Commons from 1702, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Sir Richard Child, 3rd Baronet, the second son from the third marriage of the first Baronet, his elder brother Bernard, also from the third marriage, having predeceased his father in 1698.See legend on funerary memorial to 1st Baronet in Wanstead Church In 1703, the future third Baronet, had married Dorothy, daughter of John Glynne, younger son of Sir John Glynne, Lord Chief Justice, by Dorothy, daughter of Francis Tylney, of Tylney Hall, Hampshire.

Ashmolean Museum, Oxford Sheen Priory (ancient spelling: Shene, Shean, etc.) in Sheen, now Richmond, London, was a Carthusian monastery founded in 1414 within the royal manor of Sheen, on the south bank of the Thames, upstream and approximately 9 miles southwest of the Palace of Westminster. It was built on a site approximately half a mile to the north of Sheen Palace, which itself also occupied a riverside site, that today lies between Richmond Green and the River Thames. All above-ground traces of the priory have disappeared, yet it is known that the foundations of the priory church lie to the immediate southwest of Kew Observatory, under the fairway of the 14th hole of the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Course, in Richmond Old Deer Park.Cloake, 1990, diagram p.51 It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Richmond Priory, due to the subsequent renaming of Sheen Manor in 1501. Background The King's Great Work of Henry V, centred around the rebuilt Sheen Palace, commenced winter 1413‚Äì14 Sheen Priory was built as part of King Henry V's \\"The King's Great Work\\" centred on Sheen Palace (renamed Richmond Palace in 1501). The royal manor of Sheen lay on the right (south), Surrey, bank of the River Thames, opposite the parish of Twickenham and the royal manor of Isleworth on the left, Middlesex, bank. Sheen had been a favourite residence of the last Plantagenet king Richard II (1377‚Äì1399) and his beloved wife Anne of Bohemia. When Anne died there of plague in 1394, Richard cursed the place where they had found great happiness and razed the palace to the ground. His throne was usurped by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, who ruled as Henry IV (1399‚Äì1413). Henry IV had been involved in the murder of Richard II in 1400, and in that of Archbishop Richard le Scrope, and made a vow to expiate his guilt by founding three monasteries, but died before he could fulfil his vow. Henry IV had shown little interest in the ruined Sheen but his son Henry V (1413‚Äì1422) saw its reconstruction as a means of emphasising the dynastic link between his own House of Lancaster and that of Plantagenet, of unquestioned legitimacy, and decided at the same time to found the three monasteries pledged by his father all within one great building scheme, known as \\"The King's Great Work\\". This \\"Great Work\\" commenced in the winter of 1413‚Äì14, comprising the new Sheen Palace and the following monasteries nearby:Cloake, John. Richmond Palace, its History and its Plan. London: Richmond Local History Society 2001. pp.6‚Äì7 *A monastery of the Celestine Order, established probably in Isleworth Manor. This monastery was of French monks, who refused to pray for Henry V following his warring with France, probably at Agincourt in 1415, and was therefore dissolved by the King almost immediately after its foundation.Aungier, p.21, footnote 1 It probably occupied the site in Isleworth to which Syon Monastery moved in 1431. *The Monastery of St Saviour and St Bridget of Syon, of the Order of St Augustine (1415) Syon Monastery, sometimes called Syon Abbey. The first and original site of this monastery was probably almost due west of Sheen Palace, across the river, on the left bank of the Thames in Twickenham Parish. *The House of Jesus of Bethlehem of Sheen, of the Order of Carthusians (1414)First charter of foundation of Sheen Priory dated 25 September 1414. Cloake, John (1990). Richmond's Great Monastery, The Charterhouse of Jesus of Bethlehem of Shene. London: Richmond Local History Society. pp.7‚Äì8. . Sheen Priory, the subject of the present article, built within Sheen Manor, to the north of the new palace. Establishment of the priory In 1414, Henry V established the Priory, designated \\"The House of Jesus of Bethlehem of Shene\\", for 40 monks of the Carthusian order. It was built approximately half a mile to the north of the existing royal manor house or palace. It comprised 30 cells, round a great court or cloister. Nomenclature Wyngaerde c. 1558‚Äì62. The view is from the west. The tower of the Sheen Priory Church can be seen at the far left (i.e. north), with the artist's annotation above \\"cien\\", not to be confused with \\"sion\\" which he has also depicted in its proper position. See detailed image above. During the reign of King Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509), formerly styled \\"Earl of Richmond\\", the former royal manor house or palace of Sheen built by King Henry V was replaced in 1501 by a royal palace which was renamed \\"Richmond Palace\\" in honour of Henry VII. The name of the manor itself was likewise changed from \\"Sheen\\" to \\"Richmond\\". The name of Henry's earldom derived from his former stronghold, Richmond Castle in Yorkshire, itself named after Riche Mont (Rich Mountain) in France. The Priory of Sheen, although it then found itself within the newly renamed manor of Richmond, nevertheless retained its ancient appellation of \\"Sheen\\",See e.g. the Will of Hugh Denys(d.1511), dated 1508, in which he bequeaths property to Sheen Priory, referring to the \\"Prior & Convent of the Charterhouse at Sheen\\". He was a courtier of Henry VII, therefore surely alert to the niceties of terminology. Will quoted in Aungier, History of Syon. pp.465‚Äì78 being a religious establishment, the function of which was ostensibly the glorification of God not, as in the case of the new secular palace, of the new King and Tudor dynasty, victorious after the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. In 1500, at the command of Henry VII, the town of Sheen, which had grown up around the royal manor, was renamed Richmond,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 9th. ed. (1881), vol 20, p.545a. Richmond. whereupon the entire ancient manor too, in which the new palace stood, became known as Richmond rather than Sheen. The ancient Manor of Sheen is now situated within today's London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The vestiges of Sheen Priory are thus situated in today's Borough of Richmond. That said, the ancient manor of Mortlake, which stood to the north and east of the ancient manor of Sheen, has in modern times been split into two new districts, North Sheen and East Sheen, although the area of neither was ever historically in Sheen Manor. Both are now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. James IV of Scotland Sheen Priory was the last resting place of the body of James IV of Scotland, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. His body having been found on the battlefield by the victorious English, it was enclosed in a lead coffin and sent to London, and thence to Sheen Priory. It seems that the body was not physically buried at the Priory, on account of James IV having been excommunicated. In any event, before long both the body and the Priory were lost to history. Notable clerics trained at Sheen The establishment is celebrated as having been the nursery of Cardinal Pole and many other distinguished churchmen in the early 16th century.Thornbury, Walter. Old & New London: A Narrative of its History, its People and its Places. London, undated, c. 1878 (in 6 volumes) vol.2, p.553. Dissolution of the priory Sheen Priory was dissolved in 1539 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII. Its buildings and assets became Crown property and were disposed of in accordance with the King's wishes. Sources * * Malden, H E (ed.) Victoria County History, Surrey, vol. 2 (1967) pp. 89‚Äì94.

Background  Cloud gaming platforms operate in a similar manner to remote desktops and video on demand services; games are stored and executed remotely on a provider's dedicated hardware, and streamed as video to a player's device via client software. The client software handles the player's inputs, which are sent back to the server and executed in-game. Some cloud gaming services are based on access to a virtualized Windows environment, allowing users to download and install service clients and games as they normally would on a local computer. This approach provides several advantages, including making the game accessible on-demand without the need to download and install it locally, and on a wider range of devices (including mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, digital media players, or a proprietary thin client-like device) due to lower hardware requirements over running the game locally. Some services may offer additional features to take advantage of this model, including the ability for a viewer to join a player's session and temporarily take control of the game.  Infrastructure  Cloud gaming requires significant infrastructure for the services to work as intended, including datacenters and server farms for running the games, and high-bandwidth internet connections with low latency for delivering the streams to users. The network infrastructure required to make cloud gaming feasible was, for many years, not available in most geographic areas, or unavailable to consumer markets. Due to their dependency on high-quality streaming video, the ability to use a service regularly may also be limited by data caps enforced by some internet service providers. A major factor in the quality of a cloud gaming service is latency, as the amount of delay between the user's inputs and when they take effect can affect gameplay ‚Äî especially in fast-paced games dependent on precise inputs (such as first-person shooters and fighting games). The provider's dedicated hardware can be upgraded over time in order to support higher resolutions and frame rates for the rendering and streams.  History  In 2000, G-cluster demonstrated cloud gaming technology at E3. The original offering was cloud gaming service over Wi-Fi to handheld devices. Video game developer Crytek began the research on a cloud gaming system in 2005 for Crysis, but halted development in 2007 to wait until the infrastructure and cable Internet providers were able to complete the task. OnLive was officially launched in March 2010, and its game service began in June with the sale of its OnLive microconsole. On April 2, 2015, OnLive's intellectual property was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment, and the service was shut down at the end of the month. Its assets were used as the basis of a cloud gaming service within its PlayStation product family, known as PlayStation Now. Another cloud gaming startup, Gaikai, launched in 2012; the company focused on using cloud gaming as a form of online advertising for games, where users would be able to access demos of games streamed from its servers, usually via purchased advertising or online retailers. Gaikai was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2012. In 2013, Nvidia introduced GRID, later branded as GeForce Now, as a cloud gaming service as part of its Nvidia Shield Android TV device. The company began expanding the service to computers in 2017, including support for importing a user's Steam library to run on the remote instance. In 2017, the French startup Blade launched a service known as Shadow, where users are able to rent a remote Windows 10 instance on a datacenter, with allocated access to an Intel Xeon processor and Nvidia Quadro graphics. The service is geographically-limited based on proximity to one of its datacenters; it initially launched in France, but began expanding into the United States in 2019. In May 2018, Electronic Arts acquired cloud gaming assets and talent from GameFly for an undisclosed amount. EA subsequently announced \\"Project Atlas\\", a project to explore the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Frostbite engine technology to create a \\"unified\\" platform to \\"remotely process and stream blockbuster, multiplayer HD games with the lowest possible latency, and also to unlock even more possibilities for dynamic social and cross-platform play.\\" That month, Google and Microsoft also announced cloud gaming initiatives, with Google beginning to pilot \\"Project Stream\\" (including a closed beta featuring Assassin's Creed Odyssey running via a client in the Google Chrome web browser, and Microsoft announced the upcoming Project xCloud, leveraging Microsoft Azure technology. At the Game Developers Conference in 2019, Google officially announced its cloud gaming service Stadia, which officially launched on November 19 of that year. In May, Sony announced a partnership with Microsoft to co-develop cloud solutions between divisions, including gaming. Apple Inc., which makes the iOS platform for iPhones and iPads, had looked to block cloud gaming apps on its service in mid-2020. They argued that cloud gaming services allowed developers to add games onto the iOS system that bypassed the normal checks they perform on any app before it is added to the App Store, and thus violated their terms of service. However, in September 2020, Apple altered its rules that allowed cloud gaming apps to work on iOS, with restrictions that each game must be offered as an individual download on the iOS store which the user must use before playing, though catalog apps as part of the service can list and link to these games. Amazon introduced its own cloud gaming service Luna in September 2020. Games on the service will be offered via a channel-style subscription service, with Amazon's own games and those from Ubisoft available at the service's launch.  Future = GPU resource sharing  A proposed method to improve game streaming's scalability is adaptive graphics processing unit (GPU) resource scheduling. Most cloud gaming providers are using dedicated GPUs to each person playing a game. This leads to the best performance but can waste resources. With better GPU resource scheduling algorithms, if the game does not fully utilize that GPU it can be used to help run someone else‚Äôs game simultaneously. In the past, ‚ÄúGPU virtualization was not used due to the inferior performance of the resource scheduling algorithm‚Äù. However new resource management algorithms have been developed that can allow up to 90% of the GPUs original power to be utilized even while being split among many users.  Predictive input  Algorithms could be used to help predict a player's next inputs, which could overcome the impact of latency in cloud gaming applications. Stadia's head of engineering Majd Bakar foresaw the future possibility of using such a concept to \\"[reduce] latency to the point where it's basically nonexistent\\", referring to this concept as \\"negative latency\\".

Davis was a right-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Westbrook, Kent. Early life and Kent Davis grew up in East Kent and was educated firstly at King Ethelbert School in Birchington-on-Sea and later at Thanet Technical College on the Isle of Thanet. He was coached at county level throughout his life, eventually making his first-class cricket debut for Kent in 1986 against Warwickshire. Despite making his first-class debut for the county at the age of just 20, Davis faced a challenge to remain within the team; he was expected to succeed Derek Underwood,Richard Davis, Times Obituary one of the finest left-arm spinners. This following the most successful period in the history of the county and with pitches at Canterbury which were not conducive to slow bowling. Nonetheless, between 1986 and 1993, he represented Kent in 125 first-class matches with his final appearance for the county coming against the touring Australians. Despite the nature of the pitches at Canterbury, Davis was a successful bowler for the county. In 125 matches, he took 320 wickets at a bowling average of 35.02, with 13 five wicket hauls and 2 ten wicket hauls in a match. His best bowling figures were 7/64, which came in 1992, his best with the ball. During the 1992 season, he took 74 wickets at an average of 21.74,First-class Bowling in Each Season by Richard Davis with those best figures coming against Durham at Eastwood Gardens. Up to this time, he had also developed into a handy lower order batsman for the county. In his 125 matches, he scored 1,795 runs at a batting average of 15.74, with 4 half centuries and a high score of 67 which came against Hampshire in the 1989 County Championship.Hampshire v Kent, 1989 County Championship Davis also made his debut in List-A cricket for Kent against Worcestershire.

Moves to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire Leaving Kent, Davis moved to Warwickshire who at the time were coached by Bob Woolmer. Woolmer believed Davis could improve as a cricketer if he had more self-belief, even believing he had it in him to represent England at a time when spin bowling was a declining art. He made his first-class debut for the county against Mashonaland during Warwickshire's pre-season tour to Zimbabwe. From 1994 to 1995, he represented Warwickshire in 20 first-class matches and 12 List-A matches. In 20 first-class matches, he took 54 wickets at an average of 31.01, with 3 five wicket hauls and best figures of 6/94. In his 12 List-A matches, he took 13 wickets at an average of 22.23, with best figures of 3/19.List-A Bowling For Each Team by Richard Davis In his first season with Warwickshire, he tasted instant success as the team went on to win Warwickshire's first county cricket's first treble ‚Äì Championship, Benson and Hedges Cup and AXA Equity & Law League.Circinfo profile Held in high regard by Woolmer, then Warwickshire captain Dermot Reeve did not share Woolmer's high regard of Davis and with the emergence of the young Ashley Giles, Davis left Warwickshire at the end of the 1995 season. While at the county, Woolmer had also encouraged Davis to take up coaching later in his career, calling him a \\"deep thinker\\". Joining Gloucestershire in 1996, he made his first-class debut for the county against Middlesex at Lord's. Between 1996 and 1997, he represented Gloucestershire in 24 first-class matches, the last of which came against Lancashire.First-Class Matches played by Richard Davis He also played 20 List-A matches for the county, the last of which came against Kent.

In his 20 List-A matches for the county he took 20 wickets at an average of 37.30, with best figures of 3/42. After two seasons at Bristol he left to join Sussex. Sussex and retirement Joining Sussex for the 1998 season, he represented the county exclusively in List-A cricket. During that season he played 4 List-A matches for the county in the AXA League and Benson and Hedges Cup against Lancashire, Middlesex and Essex twice. During his 4 match stint with the county, he took just a single wicket at a cost of 118.00, in what ultimately proved to be an unsuccessful spell. With this came his retirement from cricket at the end of 1998 season. In the following years he took up numerous coaching positions, with a successful career as a coach seemingly beckoning. During this time he became the cricket development officer for Greater London. Berkshire and Leicestershire In 2001, Davis came out of retirement to play as the player-coach for Berkshire. His debut in the Minor Counties Championship for the county came against Shropshire. During the 2001 season, he represented the county in 6 Minor Counties Championship matches, the last of which came against Dorset.Minor Counties Championship Matches played by Richard Davis He also made his debut in the MCCA Knockout Trophy for the county against Dorset. He represented Berkshire in 4 Trophy matches, the last of which came against the Channel Islands.Minor Counties Trophy Matches played by Richard Davis Davis also represented Berkshire in List-A matches, the first of which came when Berkshire played the Middlesex Cricket Board and Essex in the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. His final List-A match for Berkshire and in his career, came against Lincolnshire in the 1st round of the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy which was played in 2001.List A Matches played by Richard Davis It was in this match that he scored his maiden and only List-A half century, with a score of 56.Lincolnshire v Berkshire, 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy (2001) 2001 saw one of the most extraordinary chapters of his career, when on a coaching course in Northampton he was asked by Leicestershire to play a one- off County Championship match; this was due to Leicestershire's injury crisis at the time. Making a single appearance against Northamptonshire, he scored his final first-class half century, by making 51 runs, before being dismissed by Monty Panesar. To expand his fairy tale end of his first-class career, he took figures of 6/73; his wickets included those of Graeme Swann and Michael Hussey.Northamptonshire v Leicestershire, 2001 County Championship Career summary Davis was considered an able batsman, in his entire first-class career he scored 2,503 runs at an average of 15.26, with 5 half centuries and a high score of 67. A spinner who often did not get too much spin on a cricket ball, Davis was notable for his ability to bowl accurately and to tie up and end. As such he was a bowler whose style was more to defend the run rate than to actively seek to dismiss the batsman. Though, with the ball he took 421 wickets at an average of 34.92, with 17 five wicket hauls and 2 ten wicket hauls in a match, his best figures were 7/64. An able slip fielder, he took 157 catches. In his 145 List-A matches, he scored 457 runs at an average of 10.15, with a single half century high score of 56. With the ball he took 141 wickets at an average of 32.04, a single five wicket haul of 5/52. In the field he toom 57 catches in one-day cricket. Something of a journeyman, Davis was the first cricketer to have represented five different first-class counties. Death Two weeks after playing for Leicestershire and while acting as assistant coach of the England women's cricket team, Davis suffered a seizure. The cause of this seizure was discovered to be a low-grade brain tumour. During that season's winter, he underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy while still coaching Kent Women and England Women. With the treatment having little success in fighting the cancer, he underwent surgery in 2002, but his health continued to deteriorate. In 2003, while attending a match at Canterbury he was awarded a numbered county cap by his former club. Ten days before his death, his wife's sister married the then Kent captain David Fulton. Davis died at Blean in Kent on 29 December 2003. He was buried in his Kent blazer.

He tells them he was driving his grandmother, Rain, to the hospital after she broke her hip falling out of a tree. He lives with his Grandma and is schooled by her on a commune called Garland and neither understands the concept of a license nor knows the emergency number 9-1-1 Eventually, the police let him go to see Rain in the hospital. Rain is distraught. She tells the nurses that she cannot go to the hospital for two months because she has to look after Capricorn, who has no one else, and she hates the idea of him being \\"contaminated\\" by the real world. The doctors tell her she has no choice and they will have to call social services to find him a home and a school until she gets strong again. Luckily for both Cap and Rain, the social worker given Cap's case is a lady called Mrs. Donnelly. Brought up on Garland herself, she understands what Cap must be going through and invites him to stay with her at her house. The first person Cap meets is Zach Powers, the school bully and popular kid at school. Cap tells Rain he wants to go back to Garland. Rain is sympathetic. She tells him that the outside world is an unforgiving place and he should feel sorry for anyone that cannot live like he can. Cap is voted in as president. Zach and his friends Darryl, Naomi and Lena are having a great time sending Cap on wild goose chases. Naomi leaves notes from \\"Lorelei Lumley\\" in his locker. Meanwhile, Cap's popularity at school rises two-fold. One day on the school bus, the bus driver has a heart attack sending the bus veering towards a dump truck. Cap responds immediately, steering the bus away from the truck and to the hospital, where he is arrested. Despite his arrest at the hospital, the students hail him as a hero and begin helping him out with his duties as president. Hugh and Zach are the only two people unhappy with Cap's newfound celebrity status. They decide to get together and plot Cap's downfall. At the pep rally, they dress Cap up in the opposing team's uniform and send him out onto the football field, and as soon as he steps onto the field the Claverage players all charge and pile onto him, with Darryl at the front. Later, Darryl, realizing Zach was responsible, approaches him. Zach laughs at him, and Darryl, unable to compete with him in an argument of words, raises his fists to punch him. Unfortunately, Cap has stepped between them without Darryl noticing, and his punch lands directly on Cap's nose. An ambulance arrives for Cap, but it is not to take him to a hospital. Rain has arrived at the school to take him back to Garland. Sophie is doing her driving test when she realizes that the bracelet she thought her father sent her was not from him, but from Cap. She feels remorse about all the things she said and did to him, and all he did was respond in kindness. As soon as she passes her driving test she travels to Garland, determined to take Cap to the Halloween dance. In Sophie's car, they drive to Claverage Middle School. When they arrive at the school, Cap and Sophie see everyone in the parking lot holding candles and dressed in hippie clothing. One by one, they all tearfully give small speeches until finally Cap comes forward to reveal he is still alive. Everyone goes wild and Darryl steps forward to lift him through the crowd. At the back of the crowd is Rain, observing everything. A couple of days later, Cap is at working on the commune by himself when a white Mercedes pulls up and out steps Rain. Stylishly dressed and with a mobile phone and a cane, she tells Cap that she has sold Garland for $17 million, bought a condo in the city and enlisted Cap at Claverage Middle School. She insists, however, she has not sold out. They will mostly use the money to help others. Reception It was the most popular Winner of the 2010 Young Reader's Choice Awards.

Criminalization had first been proposed in the 1970s, but was opposed by the Council of Churches. In 2006, a new plan was proposed and backed by parties including VVD and PVV. When the new law was introduced, squatters occupied the former head office of the fire brigade and there were riots in Amsterdam and Nijmegen. In 2011, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ruled that the legally forced end of squatting can only occur after an intervention of a judge. Between October 2010 and December 2014, 529 people were arrested for the act of occupying derelict buildings, in 213 separate incidents as a result of which 39 people were jailed. History Squatting ban sign In 1978, the Council of Churches launched a protest which scotched a proposal to criminalise squatting. In June 2006, ministers Sybilla Dekker and Piet Hein Donner from the Dutch government proposed a plan to criminalise squatting.Letter to Minister Dekker from four main cities Other ministers, such as Alexander Pechtold, were not in favour. Representatives of the four largest Dutch cities wrote a letter stating that it would not be in their interests to proceed with a ban. Squatters nationwide made banners, hanging them on their squats in protest. Criminalization Several parties, notably the VVD party, were vocal critics of squatting. Backed by the leader of the PVV, Geert Wilders, they moved to outlaw squatting. The new squatting ban was passed by the House of Representatives on 15 October 2009 and the Senate on 1 June 2010, and became law on 1 October 2010. The penalty is one year's imprisonment or more, if violence is involved. Mayor of Amsterdam Eberhard van der Laan, and police commissioner Leen Schaap stated their joint intention to clear roughly 200 of 300 squats in Amsterdam, and to treat squatting as a criminal offence. There were estimated to be 1,500 squatters in Amsterdam. Sociologist E.T.C. Dee observes that there was a moral panic generated in the Dutch media regarding three accusations made by the police concerning booby traps and weapons caches in the squats of Amsterdam. Thus the squatters' movement was seen as increasingly violent and needing to be regulated. Reactions original size version) Squatting became a criminal offence at midnight on 1 October 2010, passing from the civil courts to the criminal courts. In Amsterdam, squatters had previously occupied the former headquarters of the Dutch fire brigade in protest. In a press release, the squatters announced on 30 September that they would be handing the building at 99 Weesperzijde over to tenants arranged by the landlord. On the last weekend in September, squatters had camped out on the Dam Square overnight as a protest. On the day itself, there was a demonstration in Amsterdam numbering 100‚Äì300 people by various estimates. As evening came, a riot began. The police charged the demonstration and protesters responded by throwing stones and vandalising cars. The police used tear gas and elven squatters were arrested. Two police officers and three police horses were injured. Protesters built ad hoc street barricades from metal fences and bicycles. There was also a riot in Nijmegen. Post-criminalization On 28 October 2011, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands decided that the legally forced end of squatting can only occur after an intervention of a judge. The Dutch government assessed the effectiveness of the new law in 2015, releasing a report giving statistics on arrests and convictions between October 2010 and December 2014. During this time period, 529 people have been arrested for the act of occupying derelict buildings in 213 separate incidents. Of the 529 arrests, 210 were found guilty. Of those convicted, 39 people were imprisoned for the new offence. The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema called for stricter treatment of squatters in 2019. That year in Amsterdam, 74 squats had been officially recorded, of which 67 had been evicted. Squatters marked the ten year anniversary of the squatting ban on 1 October 2020 in a national campaign placing banners and posters on long-term empty places. In Utrecht, a banner was hung at a building on Burgemeester Reigerstraat which had been evicted in 2019.

His ideas and teaching made a major contribution to the revival of British wood-engraving in the twentieth century. Biography Rooke was born in Acton, London and he would remain in London all of his life. His father was Thomas Matthews Rooke, for many years the studio assistant of Edward Burne-Jones, and an accomplished artist in his own right. His mother Leonora Rooke (n√©e Jones) had been governess to Burne-Jones's daughter, Margaret. Rooke studied in France at the Lyc√©e de Chartres and then at the Godolphin School in Hammersmith, London. He completed his education at the Slade and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. On 31 December 1932, Rooke married one of his pupils, Celia Mary Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes.Rooke's genealogy She practised as a wood engraver under the name Celia Fiennes. Rooke died at West London Hospital on 5 October 1953. Lethaby and the Central School of Arts and Crafts In 1899, aged 18, Rooke was employed by William Lethaby in the school holidays to make drawings of the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey. This was the start of a fruitful association with Lethaby, who had become the first principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896. He wanted it to become for design and the crafts what the Slade and the Royal Academy were for the fine arts.James Hamilton, Wood Engraving and the Woodcut in Britain c1890-1990 (London, Barrie & Jenkins, 1994), . Rooke joined the Central School as a student in 1899. In the same year the calligrapher Edward Johnston came to the Central School as a student, whereupon Lethaby immediately asked him to teach a class in calligraphy. His first class of seven students included Rooke, Eric Gill, Graily Hewitt, T. J. Cobden Sanderson, MacDonald Gill and Lawrence Christie.G. M. Ellwood, 'Famous Contemporary Art Masters: Noel Rooke' in Drawing and Design (December 1924). Johnston taught Rooke that the form of a letter should be determined by the tool making the letter, a principle which Rooke later applied to wood engraving. In 1904 Rooke also attended evening classes in wood engraving at the London County Council School of Photo-engraving and Lithography in Bolt Court, where he learned the skills of wood engraving from R. John Beedham. At the period Eric Gill gave classes in stone carving and inscriptions, and Rooke later gave Gill private lessons in wood engraving. In 1905 Rooke became a teacher of book illustration at the Central School, and introduced wood engraving for book decoration into his syllabus. He faced opposition from Frank Morley Fletcher and Sydney Lee who taught classes in colour woodcuts in the Japanese style. Lethaby had had to overcome opposition to Johnston's calligraphy classes, and, along with most artists at the time, saw wood engraving simply as the reproductive medium that it had been until then. He vetoed the introduction of the new style of wood engraving into the curriculum. When he left in 1911 Rooke was able introduce a class in lettering and wood engraving in 1912, and a class in wood engraving and poster design in 1913. In 1914 Rooke became head of the School of Book Production, a post that he held until 1946. He was an important member of a group whose ideas set the tone of the formative years of the Central School. This was a time of cross fertilisation where extraordinary people came together and barriers between crafts and skills were broken down. Lethaby was the editor of a series of books: the Artistic Crafts Series of Technical Handbooks, and Rooke drew illustrations and diagrams for three of them - Bookbinding, and the care of books (1901) by Douglas Cockerell, Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering (1906) by Johnston and Hand-loom Weaving (1910) by Luther Hooper. These became standard works on their subject, and, along with the other handbooks in the series, ran into many editions. His influence as a teacher Rooke reacted against the reproductive wood engravings of the nineteenth century, where the drawing, the creative impetus of the artist, and the engraving, carried out by a skilled craftsman, were separate. He said: There is only one way of getting a thoroughly satisfactory engraving: the designer and the engraver must be one and the same person.Noel Rooke, Woodcuts and Wood Engravings (London, Print Collectors' Club, 1926). He went on to apply the principles that he had learned from Johnston to wood engraving: Form should be expressed with tools which answer the helm with much sensitiveness. He collaborated with J. H. Mason, who had made his reputation at the Doves Press. Mason was the head of Printing, and the two worked together on marrying text, type and illustration.Sylvia Backemeyer, Making their Mark: Art, Craft and Design at the Central School 1896-1966 (London, Herbert Press, 2000), . Rooke was able to recommend his pupils, notably Vivien Gribble, as illustrators of books produced at the school. His was a major influence in reviving the practice of wood engraving in the twentieth century. Among his students were Mabel Annesley, John Farleigh, Robert Gibbings, Vivien Gribble, Muriel Jackson, Clare Leighton, Margaret Pilkington and Monica Poole. Less well known pupils include Mary Berridge,Short biography of Mary Berridge with two wood engravings John R. Biggs, Cecily Englefield, Joan PilsburyAnne Stevens and Justin Howes, Noel Rooke 1881-1953 (Oxford, Guise Society, 1984). and Hilda M. Quick.Books illustrated by Hilda M. Quick His wood engravings and other illustrations In 1920 Rooke helped to found the Society of Wood EngraversJoanna Selborne, ‚ÄòThe Society of Wood Engravers: the early years‚Äô in Craft History 1 (1988), published by Combined Arts. and exhibited with the society from 1920-1933. In the same year he became an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. As a result of his teaching, his own production was comparatively small - wood engraved, line drawn and watercolour illustrations, individual prints, posters and paintings, many of which reflect his passion for mountains. He described himself as \\"one who draws mountains and also climbs them\\". Margaret Pilkington remembers classes where Rooke dwelt on the dramatic contrasts of dark rock and snow-covered sunlit slopes, on the angularity of line and on the possibilities of abstraction presented by such scenes.David Blamires, Patricia Jaff√© and Sarah Hyde, Margaret Pilkington 1891-1974 (Buxton, Hermit Press, 1995), . He produced a double-panel wood engraving for Rupert Brooke's The Old Vicarage, Grantchester (1916), one of the first books, in this case a slim booklet, illustrated with modern wood engravings.Thomas Balston, Wood-engraving in Modern English Books (London, National Book League, 1949). His only other book with wood engravings was for the Golden Cockerel Press, an edition of The Birth of Christ (1925).Wood engravings by Rooke for The Birth of Christ In 1922 he contributed two wood engravings to Contemporary English Woodcuts, an anthology of wood engravings produced by Thomas Balston, a director at Duckworth and an enthusiast for the new style of wood engravings. Campbell Dodgson, Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote about him in his introduction to the book: \\"Mr. Rooke himself, represented by examples of his earlier and later woodcuts, has discovered a vigorous treatment of mountain forms\\".Campbell Dodgson, Contemporary English Woodcuts (London, Duckworth, 1922). He produced colour plates for two books by Robert Louis Stevenson, An Inland Voyage (1908) and Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1909); and a King Penguin book on Flowers of Marsh and Stream (1946). His interest in mountains comes across in one of his posters for the London Underground, the Downs at Betchworth,Posters by Rooke for the London Underground and in many of his paintings.Paintings of mountains by Rooke VADS (the Visual Arts Data Service) offers quick access to reproductions of Rooke's work,Examples of Rooke's wood engravings and other work and the Central School has an extensive holding of his wood engravings.Biographical details, and listings of work by Rooke held at the Central School An overview of his life and work The final judgement on Rooke as a wood engraver goes to Douglas Percy Bliss, who wrote of Vivien Gribble and Rooke: If their work had more verve and vitality they would be among the best book -decorators of our time.Douglas Percy Bliss, A History of Wood-Engraving (London, J.M. Dent, 1928). Rooke did not quite make the first division of wood engravers, but that is beside the point. He is a very important figure in the wood engraving revival, where his importance and legacy are based on his sustained influence on a wide range of engravers who carried his ideas out into the world and interpreted them in their own way. Further reading Rooke's own book on woodcuts and wood engravings gives an insight on his views and techniques. The books by GarrettAlbert Garrett, A History of British Wood Engraving (Tunbridge Wells, Midas Press, 1978), . and Hamilton give a further insight into Rooke as wood engraver, and the Backemeyer book into that extraordinary period at the Central School.

Hansen: Kloge Folk - Folkemedicin og overtro i Vestjylland (Rosenkilde og Bagger 1960) practitioners of folk magic and medicine would have a copy of the \\"Svartebok\\" (or \\"black book\\"), a tome that, according to some, was written by Cyprianus, that is, the Saint of Necromancers, Cyprian of Antioch, and by others to have been the Sixth and Seventh books of the Bible (or \\"Books of Moses\\" as the Pentateuch is known in Denmark and Norway) that were left out of the official Old Testament by the learned so that the common folk would not learn the knowledge held within the text.Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land by Kathleen Stokker, Minnesota Historical Society, 2007, , . pp. 75‚Äì76 A formulary found in a \\"black book\\" recovered from a farm near Elverum contains many formulas such as one for a toothache that commands the user of the charm to write the words \\"Agerin, Nagerin, Vagerin, Jagerin, Ipagerin, Sipia\\" on a piece of paper using a new pen, cut the paper into three small pieces, place the first piece onto the tooth in the evening and in the morning spit the piece into the fire.

There is an old idea that it was \\"Klok gumma\\" who often fell victim to the Witch Trials in the 17th century, but this does not appear to be true. However, some \\"wise women\\" and \\"wise men\\" were punished, not for witchcraft but often under the indictment point of \\"superstition\\" (Swedish: \\"Vidskepelse\\"). In the 1670s, the wise man Johan Eriksson of Knutby was sentenced to seven gauntlet for \\"superstition\\", and again in the 1680s to nine. Per Ericsson of Dalarna, who read the diseases in wine, was punished both in 1720 and 1726. Brita Bi√∂rn of Gotland said in court that she learned to heal the sick when she spent some time in the underworld, and she was sentenced to prison terms in both 1722 and 1737. The punishment of Sweden's \\"cunning folk\\" only seemed to have the opposite effect. Ericsson said that his clients had been coming in greater numbers after the rulings against him, and that he would be forced to hide if he was to obey the court and refrain from his practice, and in the Bi√∂rn case, the vicar complained that people from throughout the country came to seek her help, and relied on her as a God after her first sentence. The sentences, in reality, had the effect of good advertising, and Brita's daughter and granddaughter's daughter were also healing women. There are many examples of well-known \\"cunning folk\\" who were known far beyond their village boundaries, such as Ingeborg i Mj√§rhult in the 18th century and Kisamor and Gota-Lena in the 19th century. In the 16th century, Brigitta Andersdotter was often hired by Queen Margaret Leijonhufvud. In Norway some women such as Mor S√¶ther (1793‚Äì1851), Anna Brandfjeld (1810‚Äì1905) and Valborg Valland (1821‚Äì1903) achieved national fame, unusual for women of the time. The customs persisted well into the 20th century, until the medical doctor became more accessible to the public. In the 19th century, every neighbourhood in Norway had at least one folk- healer.Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land by Kathleen Stokker, Minnesota Historical Society, 2007, , . p. 23 Such beliefs in folk-medicine, magic, and the use of \\"black books\\" were taken by migrants to the Americas. However, many beliefs died out in Norwegian-American communities around the 1920s with many not having knowledge of the subject or of the \\"black book\\". Knowledge of these beliefs did last longer in Norway, even if they were not commonly believed in by Norwegians. Britain The term \\"cunning man\\" or \\"cunning woman\\" was most widely used in southern England and the Midlands, as well as in Wales.Hutton 1999. p. 85. Such people were also frequently known across England as \\"wizards\\", \\"wise men\\" or \\"wise women\\", or in southern England and Wales as \\"conjurers\\" or as \\"dyn(es) hysbys\\" (knowing man or woman) in the Welsh language.Davies 2003. p. 184. In Cornwall they were sometimes referred to as \\"pellars\\", which some etymologists suggest originated from the term \\"expellers\\", referring to the practice of expelling evil spirits. Folklorists often used the term \\"white witch\\", though this was infrequently used amongst the ordinary folk as the term \\"witch\\" had general connotations of evil.Hutton 1999. p. 86. Certain Christian theologians and Church authorities believed that the cunning folk, being practitioners of magic, were in league with the Devil and as such were akin to the more overtly Satanic and malevolent witches. Partly because of this, laws were enacted across England, Scotland and Wales that often condemned cunning folk and their magical practices, but there was no widespread persecution of them akin to the Witch Hunt, largely because most common people firmly distinguished between the two: witches were seen as being harmful and cunning folk as useful.Davies 2003. pp. 7‚Äì13. In England during the Early Mediaeval period, various forms of folk magic could be found amongst the Anglo-Saxons, who referred to such practitioners as wicca (male) or wicce (female), or at times also as dry, practitioners of drycraeft, the latter of which have been speculated as being anglicised terms for the Irish drai, a term referring to druids, who appeared as anti-Christian sorcerers in much Irish literature of the period.Hutton 2009. p. 47. Some of the spells and charms that had been used in the Anglo- Saxon polytheist era continued to be used following Christianization. However, as historian Owen Davies noted, \\"although some such pre-Christian magic continued, to label it pagan is to misrepresent the people who used it and the context in which it was used.\\"Davies 2003. p. 185. In England and Wales, cunning folk had operated throughout the latter part of the Mediaeval and into the Early Modern period. In the 15th and 16th centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private lawsuits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the first of the Witchcraft Acts, the Witchcraft Act of 1542, enacted under the reign of Henry VIII, which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell.Davies 2003. p. 4. This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry's son Edward VI, something that the historian Owen Davies believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was a moral issue that was better for the Church to deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.Davies 2003. p. 5. A model of a 19th-century cunning woman in her house, at the Museum of Witchcraft, Boscastle in England For the following few decades, the magical practices of the cunning folk remained legal, despite opposition from certain religious authorities. It was a time of great religious upheaval in the country as Edward's successor, his sister Mary I, reimposed Roman Catholicism, before Anglicanism was once again restored under Elizabeth I. In 1563, after the return of power to the Anglican Church of England, a bill was passed by parliament designed to illegalise \\"Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts\\", again being aimed at both the alleged witches and the cunning folk. However, this law was not as harsh as its earlier predecessor, with the death penalty being reserved for those who were believed to have conjured an evil spirit or murdered someone through magical means, whilst those for whom the use of magic was a first offence faced a year's imprisonment and four stints in the pillory.Davies 2003. p. 06-07. Nonetheless, this law would have little effect on the cunning folk, as \\"the attention and focus of the courts shifted away from the activities of cunning-folk and towards the maleficium of supposed witches\\"Davies 2003. p. 7. \\\\- the Witch Hunt that had been raging in Scotland and in many parts of continental Europe had finally arrived in England. Whilst across England, many people were accused of witchcraft by members of their local communities and put on trial, the cunning folk very rarely suffered a similar fate. It was unusual for a cunning man or woman to actually be accused of witchcraft; in the county of Essex for instance, whereas around four hundred people had been put on trial for witchcraft, only four of those were identifiably cunning folk.Davies 2003. p. 13. However, many of the professional witch-hunters and theologians continued to proclaim the cunning craft as being the same as witchcraft, with them both being caused by the Devil. With the decline in the witch trials in the latter part of the 17th and early 18th centuries, partly due to the rise of the Enlightenment amongst the educated elite, a new law was introduced, the Witchcraft Act of 1736. Unlike earlier laws, this did not accept the existence of magic, and took the opinion that there never had been any witches, and it, therefore, came down heavier on the cunning folk, who were claiming to perform genuine magical spells. It portrayed the cunning folk as practitioners of \\"explicitly fraudulent practices designed to fool the credulous\\" in order to gain money off of them.Davies 2003. pp. 20‚Äì21. Germany The belief in cunning folk and the use of \\"white magic\\" to be used for healing and as protection against \\"black magic\\" was once widespread in Germany;Lucifer ascending: the occult in folklore and popular culture Bill Ellis, University Press of Kentucky, 2004, , however, during the early modern period such practices gradually became less accepted by the authorities, partly because the belief in \\"white magic\\" was viewed by the church authorities to be contrary to Biblical teachings and partly due to the loss of revenues for certain groups such as barber-surgeons and physicians, as was the case in Rothenburg ob der Tauber in which periodical action was taken against users of \\"white magic\\". The usual punishment was banishment rather than execution as was common for others convicted of witchcraft and the use of \\"black magic\\" Witchcraft narratives in Germany: Rothenburg 1561-1652 Alison Rowlands, Manchester University Press, 2003 , , pp. 72‚Äì73 In Germany practitioners of folk-magic were almost always female; however, by contrast the Hexenmeister (also a term for a warlock) or HexenfinderBeleg laut dem Deutschen Rechtsw√∂rterbuch in: Basler Jahrbuch 1935, Seite 41 und in: Hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde Heft 2, Band 48/1932, Seite 44 who hunted witches and \\"neutralised\\" them on behalf of society was always male.Lucifer ascending: the occult in folklore and popular culture Bill Ellis, University Press of Kentucky, 2004, , , p. 22 Ireland In Ireland, the cunning-folk were known as bean feasa (\\"woman of knowledge\\"); banfh√°idh or f√°idhbhean (\\"female seer\\"); bean bh√°n (\\"white woman\\"), bean chaointe (\\"keening woman\\") and bean ghl√∫ine (\\"joint woman\\"). These would provide traditional herbal cures and perform funeral tasks like preparing corpses. Gearoid √ì Crualaoich described the bean feasa as ‚Äúan oracular authority for her community regarding the meaning and significance of experiences they fail to understand.‚Äù Biddy Early (1798‚Äì1872) was a famous practioner. Male practitioners also existed, primarily providing traditional cures. They were known as fear feasa (\\"man of knowledge\\") or lucht pisreoga (\\"people of traditions\\").  Italy  The names used for cunning-folk in Italy vary from region to region, although such names include praticos (wise people), guaritori (healers), fattucchiere (fixers), donne che aiutano (women who help) and mago, maga or maghiardzha (sorcerers). At times, they were sometimes called streghe (witches), although usually only \\"behind their backs or by those who either are sceptical of their powers or believe they deal in black magic.\\"Magliocco 2009. p. 114. Unlike in other parts of Europe, such as Britain, the cunning profession survived the 20th century and into the early 21st, allowing Italian-American sociologist Sabina Magliocco to make a brief study of them (2009).Magliocco 2009. As in the rest of Europe, the primary role of the Italian cunning-folk was apparently in healing, both through the use of herbs and through spiritual healing. The former required knowledge about various plants and herbs on the behalf of the cunning-person, although the spiritual healing was believed to come from an inner power, known as la forza (power), la virt√π (virtue) or il Segno (the sign).Magliocco 2009. p.114-116. Such healing was often in the form of removing the malocchio, or evil eye, which had cursed someone.Magliocco 2009. p.123. Italian cunning craft was, and continued to remain rooted in the country's Roman Catholicism, which is evident from the use of charms and prayers, which often call upon the aid of saints.Magliocco 2009. p. 104. Such magical practitioners also widely believed that they dealt with spirit beings, both benevolent (who would aid them) and malevolent (whom they would have to combat). The latter included the unquiet dead as well as supernatural witches who were believed to cause harm to people, whilst the former included ancestors, the helpful dead and saints, who could help defeat these malevolent entities.Magliocco 2009. pp. 117‚Äì118 Magical tools were also utilised by Italian cunning-folk, and whilst these varied between both regions and practitioners, these commonly include fiber ropes or cords to bind, knives or scissors to cut away illness, and mirrors and weapons to reflect or scare away malevolent spirits.Magliocco 2009. p. 120.

Biography  Originating from Aomori Prefecture, Miki Furukawa placed an advertisement in a local magazine seeking fellow musicians in 1995, leading to the formation of the rock band Supercar. Supercar, which released its influential debut album Three Out Change in 1998, has been characterized as having \\"almost foundational importance to 21st century Japanese indie rock\\". After a successful, ten-year career, Supercar disbanded in 2005 in order for the members to pursue different interests. In 2006 Furukawa released her first solo album, Mirrors, featuring a mixture of guitar-based rock songs and electronic dance-pop. Bondage Heart (2008) pointed in a new direction, with heavy influences from post-punk, psychedelic rock and noise, whereas Very (2010) was a mostly electropop-oriented record. In December 2009, software developer AH Software used voice samples from Furukawa to create the Vocaloid voice library SF-A2 Miki. In 2011, Miki Furukawa and former Supercar bandmate Koji Nakamura formed the band called Lama. Lama jump-started their formation with a single entitled \\"Spell\\", which has been used as an opening theme for the anime No. 6.

Rocky Top's Sundance Kid (aka: \\"Rufus\\") (April 8, 2000 - August 9, 2012) was a Bull Terrier who is best known for being the 2006 Best In Show winner at the Westminster Dog Showhandled by Kathy Kirk PHA. He is the first Colored Bull Terrier to win Best in Show at Westminster, with the only other victory for his breed going to a White Bull Terrier in 1918. He also won Best In Show at the National Dog show, and on retirement trained as a therapy dog. He is the most successful Colored Bull Terrier Show Dog of all time. Early life Rufus' sire was Einstein the Joker, whose most notable win was for becoming the youngest Bull Terrier World Champion at the World Dog Show in 1995. He lived with his owners, Barbara and Tom Bishop, since he was 10 weeks old. Show history Rocky Top's Sundance Kid visiting the Bloomberg building in New York City By the age of thirteen and a half month, Rufus had earned his Championship title and Register of Merit. In 2005 Rufus won Best in Show at The National Dog Show, hosted by The Kennel Club of Philadelphia. Also in 2005 Rufus won Best In Show at the Morris & Essex Kennel Club Dog Show, and 1st in the terrier Group at the Eukanuba Championship dog show in 2005. In judging for Best in Show at Westminster, Rufus was joined by a Golden Retriever (Ch. Chuckanut Party Favour O' Nove), a Dalmatian (Ch. Merry Go Round Mach Ten), a Rottweiler (Ch. Carter's Noble Shaka Zulu), a Scottish Deerhound, a Pug (Ch. Kendoric's Riversong Mulroney) and an Old English Sheepdog. Of all the breeds being judged, only the Pug and the Sheepdog had previously won Best in Show. Judging was conducted by James Reynolds, with the crowd favouring the Golden Retriever. The Dalmatian was owned by Dick and Linda Stark who also own the German Shorthaired Pointer Ch. Kan-Point's VJK Autumn Roses, who won the previous year's Best in Show. When the judge announced the winner, it seemed like an upset, although the terrier group is the most successful at Westminster. On winning, Rufus became the first Colored Bull Terrier to take the title, with the only other Bull Terrier to take the title being Ch. Haymarket Faultless, a White Bull Terrier, in 1918. Speaking of Rufus, judge James Reynolds described him as \\"The classic profile of a colored bull terrier.\\" Following his win, owner Barbara Bishop announced his retirement from the show ring. Rufus retired as the most successful Colored Bull Terrier of all time, with 35 all breed Best in Shows, 135 Best in Group firsts and the BTCA National Speciality on three occasions. Retirement After winning at Westminster, Rufus was presented with a proclamation by the Monmouth County Board of Freeholders at a meeting in Freehold, New Jersey. Following his retirement, Rufus retrained as a therapy dog, visiting schools, nursing homes and senior citizen programs. Rufus was the center star for his debut on Animal Planet's \\"Dogs 101\\". In 2010, he was one of the winners at the 11th AKC Humane Fund Awards Award for Canine Excellence (ACE).

Jack claims he is being wrongly accused as his actions were in self-defence, and Nellie agrees to shelter him for a while until he can make good his escape. When her husband Bob (Rome) returns home, he finds evidence which Nellie has overlooked indicating that a man has been staying in his absence. He assumes the worst and is consumed by jealous rage. Nellie refuses to break Jack's confidence by telling Bob the truth, and becomes so fearful and distraught about Bob's treatment of her that she flees from home, taking their baby with her. Nellie finds employment with Lord and Lady Lafene, who are happy to let her keep her baby with her. Before long however, Lord Lafene starts trying to take advantage of her and she runs away again.

Built in 1903 by the prominent local architecture firm of Tourtellotte and Co. (later Tourtellotte & Hummel), it served as the clubhouse of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows of Ada Lodge No. 3. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, due largely to its association with Tourtellotte. Its sandstone masonry was quarried from nearby Table Rock. In 1953, the north half of the building was demolished, and construction began on the First Security Building (now known as Plaza 121) in its place. Also demolished at the time was the building's original ornate, Gothic-style entrance. In 1990, the Odd Fellows sold the remaining building to First Security (now part of Wells Fargo). Over the objections of some members of the Idaho State Historical Society, First Security demolished the remaining Odd Fellows building in 1994, citing concerns about the building's condition. In its place, First Security created a \\"pocket park\\" that included a low wall made from some of the temple's original sandstone. The remainder of the stone was donated to the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, which used it in the construction of its outdoor theater on Warm Springs Avenue, and to the Boise School District, which used it in the restoration of the Bown House, an 1879 building on the campus of Riverside Elementary School. The park only existed for a little over a decade; in 2005, the First Security Building was renovated and expanded to become Plaza 121, which covers much of the lot, although the wall built from the Odd Fellows Temple's sandstone can still be seen in front of the Berryhill & Co. restaurant that now occupies the ground floor of the site.

Vance Federal Building and United States Courthouse, previously known as the U.S. Post Office and Federal Building & Courthouse, is located at 1800 5th Avenue North in Birmingham, Alabama. The Beaux-Arts-style building was constructed in 1921. It served historically as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, and as a post office. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1976. It is still in use by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In 1990, the United States Congress enacted H.R.3961, officially redesignating the building as the \\"Robert S. Vance Federal Building\\", in honor of Robert Smith Vance, a United States Court of Appeals judge who had been assassinated the previous year by a mail-bomb sent to his home. The bill was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on May 29, 1990, becoming Public Law No: 101-304.Bill Summary and Status on Thomas. Significance The building is representative of the Classical Revival style of architecture, and because it is a continuing symbol of the Federal presence in Birmingham. With its sleekness and lack of ornate embellishment, the Birmingham Federal Building was a precursor to the more conservative Classicism exhibited in the Federal Buildings of the 1930s. The Classical Revival style of the building seems to be a transition between the pre-World War I preponderance of Beaux Arts Classicism and the more austere classicism of the 1920s and '30's. The Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore is listed as architect of the building. It was common in the early 20th century for the employees of the U.S. Treasury Department to design Federal buildings with the Supervising Architect listed as the architect of record.General Services Administration page on the Robert S. Vance Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The original United States Post Office in Birmingham was a small, frame structure on 19th Street. Before the Falling Fire of '59, the building was used as a stop in the Underground Railroad. The Post Office moved three times before locating in the new building in 1921. Although the site was acquired for the building in 1911, and the original plans completed in 1916, construction of the Federal Building was apparently halted during World War I. The building was finally completed and occupied in September 1921, though the cornerstone was laid in May 1918. Birmingham, founded in 1871, was just beginning to boom in the early 20th century. Much of the credit for obtaining such a large building for the young city goes to Congressman (later Senator) Oscar W. Underwood, who obtained the appropriations for initial design and construction, and continued to seek increases as the size and cost of the building grew. The Post Office has moved out of the building, but the structure continues to maintain a prominent presence in the financial/business district of downtown Birmingham. Occupying an entire city block of 5th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, the building is a local landmark and the historic symbol of the Federal presence in Birmingham. Architectural description The Federal Building and United States Courthouse is a four-story white marble building of the Classical Revival style. It occupies an entire block of 5th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets in the Central Business District of downtown Birmingham. The main elevation (south) includes a fourteen bay central colonnade flanked on either side by a projecting entrance pavilion and wing. The wings extend rearward so that the mass of the building creates a U-shape. The original building (1921) was two stories high, above a full basement. In the later 1920s a two-story addition was constructed appearing as a third level, slightly recessed behind a balustrade, and an attic below a hipped roof. The central colonnade is composed of fourteen free-standing Ionic columns. Each bay between the columns contains an arched window at the first floor. The colonnade supports an unembellished entablature with an unadorned architrave and denticulated cornice, which continues around the south, east and west elevations. The third floor is largely hidden at the central colonnade by a marble balustrade. The projecting entry pavilions flank the central colonnade. Each entry is approached by a broad flight of granite steps flanked by marble cheek walls with original cast bronze light standards. The arched main entries are delineated by engaged Ionic columns which support the entablature above the second floor level. The east facade is composed of a five bay colonnade at the center with flanking three bay pavilions. Six engaged Ionic columns comprise the colonnade, which is flanked by rectangular piers. The projections flanking the central recessed east pavilion are three bays wide. Copper clad dormers emerge from the roof - one over each end pavilion, and three over the center. Two bronze and glass entry doors appear at the head of short flights of steps at the northeast and southeast corners. The doors are set within an arched opening and are surmounted by nine-light arched windows. Gothic, lantern- style, wall-mounted fixtures flank each door. The west elevation is similar to the east, except that a shingled penthouse appears on the roof of this elevation. There is one arched entryway at the northwest corner. At the center of the elevation, marble steps lead down to a basement entry (now closed). The building site is surrounded on the south, east and west elevations by a massive marble balustrade. Marble clad walls off the balustrade open onto the entries. The landscaping is dominated by magnolia trees at the east and west elevations. The north elevation contains the original loading dock area. The east and west elevations continue around to the north end with original detailing. The walls of the light court are light grey brick. The original loading dock has been filled-in and is used for parking and as a secured entry. Significant interior spaces include the marble finished lobby with brass elevators and grand marble staircases at each end; marble elevator lobbies and corridors at second and third floors; and a ceremonial courtroom on the third floor which features full-height wood paneling. The building is currently undergoing a major remodel to bring it back to a more original look on the interior and a restoration of the exterior.

Although he was publicly criticized by Fife House, the event's beneficiary, he has noted in subsequent interviews that the press attention he gained from the incident actually advanced his career. Cole has made and exhibited work that incorporates both performance and material objects. In 2007, he collaborated with Luis Jacob on A Dance for Those of Us Whose Hearts Have Turned to Ice, an installation based on the work of contemporary dance pioneer Francoise Sullivan and British sculptor Barbara Hepworth. Cole choreographed and performed in the video component of the work, which was first presented at Documenta in Kassell, Germany, and later at Birch Contemporary in Toronto. In 2015, Cole turned his attention to the late Canadian painter Tom Thomson. Partly developed at a Drake Devonshire Residency in March 2015, the Thomson project culminated in #Hashtaggalleryslut, presented at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2016.

He later became leader of a small fleet in the Aegean Sea. Family background His father was Gerodimos Stathas, head of the Stathaioi family in the Valtos region in Central Greece. Gerodimos took part in the unsuccessful Orlov Revolt. After the Russo-Turkish War ended, Gerodimos successfully defended against the Turkish reprisals that followed. Revolutionary acts In 1804 he formed a regiment to help the Serbs that were rebelling against the Ottoman rule.The establishment of the Balkan national states, 1804-1920 by Charles&Barbara; Jelavich After that he and some other armatoloi in the Olympus area, declared the revolution against the Sultan. The Russian Emperor Alexander I had promised them help, but they were again left to their fate. Stathas and a group of Greek military commanders fled to the Aegean sea. In 1807, Kolokotronis met with them in Skiathos. There, Stathas and Nikotsaras were initiated to the Filiki Eteria.  The Black Ships The group built up a fleet of 70 small ships divided into 10 squadrons. Giannis Iskos was named Admiral of this fleet with Nikotsaras second in command. The fleet allegedly hailed the flag that was to become the Greek national flag after the revolution. All 70 ships were painted black. As, at the time, they were not serving a State and no war was declared, they were considered pirates. They took action in the Aegean sea, harassing the Turkish navy and blockading major ports in Thessalia, Macedonia and Asia Minor. During their 10-month reign, Salonica suffered from a loose blockade as the \\"pirates\\" captured most of the ships entering or leaving the port. After 10 months, heavy winter and lack of ammunition obliged Giannis Stathas to disassemble the fleet. End of life He returned to Valtos and little is known for him thereafter. He was allegedly killed in Amfilochia in 1812.

He is notable for introducing a neo-Byzantine style of painting to Australia, and winning a number of major Australian art prizes including the Blake Prize (1952) and the Sulman Prize (in both 1957 and 1970). In 1969 the Australian artist and art critic James Gleeson described Kmit as \\"one of the most sumptuous colourists of our time\\".  Arrival in Australia  Michael Kmit studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Krak√≥w, but due to the conflict in World War II, he was forced to leave his homeland and found himself a displaced person in Innsbruck, Austria where he met Dorothea (Edda) in 1945. They married in Landeck and later moved to Bregenz where his two daughters, Xenia & Tania (Tatiana) were born, in 1946 and 1948. While in post-war Europe Kmit studied under cubist Fernand L√©ger in Paris, and futurist Carlo Carr√† in Italy. Kmit emigrated to Australia in 1949, as part of the Australian Government's immigration scheme. He was contracted to work in Sydney for two years in a job selected for him by the Australian Government's employment service. He initially worked at a cement factory in Villawood, New South Wales, and then as a railway porter as contracted reimbursement for his passage. But after Kmit met the artists James Gleeson and Paul Haefliger, who were impressed with his work, he was introduced to other artists including Donald Friend and Russell Drysdale. His artist friends later helped him find lodging at Merioola and work nearer to the artist community in Sydney. Painting at night, during the day Kmit worked as a railway porter and cleaner while he established himself \\"as one of Australia's best artists\\" of the time. He lived in Elizabeth Bay with his family until he moved to the United States.  Influence on Australian Art  Kmit's images, inspired by the Byzantine style of religious icon painting, were well received in Australia for their fresh approach and new subjects. Labeled neo-Byzantine, his paintings integrated stylized portraiture with geometric cubist and constructivist forms, patterns and vivid color. During the 1950s, before leaving for the United States at the latter end of the decade, Kmit was a major influence on many artists, particularly those of the Merioola Group (also known as the \\"Charm School\\"). Gleeson described Kmit as \\"one of the most sumptuous colourists of our time\\". Paul Haefliger wrote: \\"Of all the foreign aspirants to art who have visited these shores since the war, Michael Kmit is the only one who has made an impression on the present generation of painters.\\" After winning a string of awards including the Blake Prize (1953) and the Sulman Prize (1957), he left Australia for the United States in 1958, residing in the San Francisco-Bay Area of California. His American period did not result in a lot of success and also, due to the end of his marriage, he went through a period of depression. Returning in 1965 his style and format had changed and the high praise for his work was replaced with cautious criticism. He married Norma Randall a few years after his return to Australia and his son Michael Kmit Junior was born in May, 1968. However, by the time \\"Cassandra\\" (1979) was painted, only two years before his death, Kmit had returned to the previous vigour of his 1950s works.  Exhibitions  In 1951 Michael Kmit showed his work for the first time in Brisbane at the Johnstone Gallery, where the owner Brian Johnstone intended to exhibit \\"the most creative work in Australia today\\", particularly that of \\"brilliant\\" younger artists. Until his death Kmit exhibited in numerous group shows throughout the Australian States of Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and South Australia, including selections for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes. Kmit was a member and exhibited with the Sydney branch of the Contemporary Art Society, the \\"Sydney Group\\" and the Society of Artists. He was also an honorary member, and exhibited with the Ukrainian Artists Society of Australia.

Its architecture and feature set are derived from the initial use case in commercial/larger installations.  System architecture  papaya CMS is a software build upon a modular concept, to use it as framework for special applications beside the typical tasks of a content management system. It fully supports unicode, multi-language and multi-site installations. All texts, configuration data etc. is stored as XML in a relational database. Media files such as images and videos are located in the file system and will be managed by papaya and referenced as needed. Many functions (such as database access, authentication, build methods for backend menus, etc.) are defined centrally and can be accessed through an abstraction layer. papaya CMS is developed in PHP and object-oriented. Data is stored in XML, XSLT is used as template language. The system does not use self-developed or proprietary script- or templating languages.  Special features  Unlike many other CMS papaya CMS is characterized by the fact that it is available under the GPL on the one side. On the other side, a company behind the product is available that provides support and training.  Accessibility  With its clear separation of content, layout and formatting using XSL/XSLT, anything possible in XHTML/HTML can be implemented in papaya CMS - this is in the hands of the developer.

Block graphs are sometimes erroneously called Husimi trees (after K√¥di Husimi), but that name more properly refers to cactus graphs, graphs in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle.See, e.g., , a 1983 review by Robert E. Jamison of another paper referring to block graphs as Husimi trees; Jamison attributes the mistake to an error in a book by Mehdi Behzad and Gary Chartrand. Block graphs may be characterized as the intersection graphs of the blocks of arbitrary undirected graphs.. Characterization Block graphs are exactly the graphs for which, for every four vertices u, v, x, and y, the largest two of the three distances d(u,v) + d(x,y), d(u,x) + d(v,y), and d(u,y) + d(v,x) are always equal... They also have a forbidden graph characterization as the graphs that do not have the diamond graph or a cycle of four or more vertices as an induced subgraph; that is, they are the diamond-free chordal graphs. They are also the Ptolemaic graphs (chordal distance-hereditary graphs) in which every two nodes at distance two from each other are connected by a unique shortest path, and the chordal graphs in which every two maximal cliques have at most one vertex in common. A graph G is a block graph if and only if the intersection of every two connected subsets of vertices of G is empty or connected. Therefore, the connected subsets of vertices in a connected block graph form a convex geometry, a property that is not true of any graphs that are not block graphs.. Because of this property, in a connected block graph, every set of vertices has a unique minimal connected superset, its closure in the convex geometry. The connected block graphs are exactly the graphs in which there is a unique induced path connecting every pair of vertices. Related graph classes Block graphs are chordal, distance-hereditary, and geodetic. The distance-hereditary graphs are the graphs in which every two induced paths between the same two vertices have the same length, a weakening of the characterization of block graphs as having at most one induced path between every two vertices. Because both the chordal graphs and the distance- hereditary graphs are subclasses of the perfect graphs, block graphs are perfect. Every tree, cluster graph, or windmill graph is a block graph. Every block graph has boxicity at most two.Block graphs, Information System on Graph Class Inclusions. Block graphs are examples of pseudo-median graphs: for every three vertices, either there exists a unique vertex that belongs to shortest paths between all three vertices, or there exists a unique triangle whose edges lie on these three shortest paths. The line graphs of trees are exactly the block graphs in which every cut vertex is incident to at most two blocks, or equivalently the claw-free block graphs. Line graphs of trees have been used to find graphs with a given number of edges and vertices in which the largest induced subgraph that is a tree is as small as possible.. The block graphs in which every block has size at most three are a special type of cactus graph, a triangular cactus. The largest triangular cactus in any graph may be found in polynomial time using an algorithm for the matroid parity problem. Since triangular cactus graphs are planar graphs, the largest triangular cactus can be used as an approximation to the largest planar subgraph, an important subproblem in planarization. As an approximation algorithm, this method has approximation ratio 4/9, the best known for the maximum planar subgraph problem. Block graphs of undirected graphs If G is any undirected graph, the block graph of G, denoted B(G), is the intersection graph of the blocks of G: B(G) has a vertex for every biconnected component of G, and two vertices of B(G) are adjacent if the corresponding two blocks meet at an articulation vertex. If K1 denotes the graph with one vertex, then B(K1) is defined to be the empty graph. B(G) is necessarily a block graph: it has one biconnected component for each articulation vertex of G, and each biconnected component formed in this way must be a clique. Conversely, every block graph is the graph B(G) for some graph G. If G is a tree, then B(G) coincides with the line graph of G. The graph B(B(G)) has one vertex for each articulation vertex of G; two vertices are adjacent in B(B(G)) if they belong to the same block in G.

He served as the Republican member of the Tennessee Senate from the 7th district, including Knoxville, Farragut, University of Tennessee, Powell and other parts of Knox County. Background Campfield was born on June 8, 1968. Originally from Vestal, New York and a 1986 graduate of Vestal High School where he was named \\"Sportsman of the year\\" for Wrestling and later was inducted into their high school hall of fame, Campfield moved to Knoxville at age 25. He received an associate degree in Marketing from Broome Community College in 1989. He received a B.S. in Management from Regents College, now known as Excelsior College, in Albany, New York. He has achieved black belts in multiple martial arts disciplines, including judo, jujitsu, and karate. He was the assistant instructor for judo and jujitsu classes taught by sensei Donald Tyrell at the University of Tennessee. He has been involved with the Young Republicans, the College Republicans, and the American Red Cross. Campfield is an unmarried Catholic.Lakin, Matt. \\"Bistro at the Bijou owner boots, bans state Sen. Stacey Campfield for AIDS remarks\\", Knoxville News Sentinel. January 30, 2012 Tennessee House of Representatives He was first elected in 2004 to the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 2005, Campfield said that he was interested in joining the legislative Black Caucus. Campfield described the group's bylaws as racist because he said they restrict membership based on race, which described as being more restrictive than the Ku Klux Klan's bylaws that only restrict based on the ideology of white supremacy. The leader of the Black Caucus considered asking members of the group to vote on whether to give Campfield honorary membership without voting rights, but Campfield said he only wanted full membership saying \\"Separate but equal did not work in the 1960s and anything short of full membership is an insult to equal rights.\\" As of 2006, felons were eligible to vote in Tennessee as long as they are not delinquent on any payments of child support or victim restitution. Because there is no law prohibiting voting by non-felons who are delinquent on child support payment, a bill was proposed dropping the eligibility for felons of being timely with child support payments in 2006. Campfield opposed the bill, saying that one way a felon can show rehabilitation is by being timely on any child support payments. Campfield sponsored a bill to issue death certificates for aborted fetuses in 2007. Campfield said he wanted people to be able to find out how many abortions were being performed in Tennessee and to note the loss of human lives. Tennessee already required abortions to be reported to the Office of Vital Records, and the number of abortions performed in the state was publicly available. In 2008, Campfield sponsored a bill requiring public colleges in Tennessee to allow their full-time employees with state- issued handgun-carry permits to carry their handguns on campus.Sher, Andy. \\"Bill to allow guns on campuses sparks debate\\" , Chattanooga Times Free Press. March 14, 2008. The Tennessee Board of Regent opposed the bill, saying that only campus security police at universities should possess weapons on their campuses, and that local police are the best way to protect community college campuses. Two years later, he sponsored a bill to make private the names of people with state-issued handgun permits, but not the names of people whose permits had been revoked. Also in 2008, Campfield proposed a bill to ban teachers from teaching as part of the lesson plan about homosexuality in Tennessee's public elementary and middle schools, saying that the topic should only be discussed by each student's family.\\"Lawmaker Wants 'Gay-Talk' Banned From Classroom\\" , WTVF. February 18, 2008. The bill died in committee. The Tennessee Equality Project opposed the bill, saying that teachers need not advocate for or against homosexuality, but they should allow students to debate the issue of homosexuality. In 2008, Campfield proposed a bill to prohibit Tennessee public colleges from admitting illegal immigrants. Campfield said that if students cannot enroll in classes with unpaid parking tickets, then students should not be able to enroll in classes if they are in violation of federal immigration laws either. In 2009, Campfield introduced a bill to limit lottery winnings to $600 for people on public assistance. Campfield said that people on public assistance should not be buying lottery tickets and instead should be using that money to buy food for their children. Tennessee law already prohibited the use of public assistance money to purchase lottery tickets. The bill also prohibited prisoners from redeeming winning lottery tickets. Tennessee Senate In 2010 Campfield was elected to the State Senate.Humphrey, Tom. \\"Humphrey on the Hill:Stacey Campfield Wins Senate District 7 GOP Nomination\\" . Knoxville News Sentinel.

September 12, 2010. Tennessee holds open primaries, where any voter may vote in any party's primary election. Campfield introduced a bill to change to a closed primary. The bill would only allow a registered voter to vote in a primary election if the voter was affiliated with that particular political party. Campfield said that voters often vote in the other party's primary in order to vote for a weaker candidate or one that is closer to the voter's own party's politician positions, both of which Campfield opposed. Campfield's time in the Tennessee Senate has been met with much national acclaim. On August 7, 2014, Campfield was defeated 66%-28% in the Republican state senate primary by Knox County Commissioner Richard Briggs who outspent Campfield almost 4 to 1 (Briggs $380,000.00 to Campfields $100,000.00). Briggs had courted many high-profile Democrats who had openly encouraged Democrats to cross party lines to unseat Campfield in the Republican primary.Lucas L. Johnson II, \\"State Senator Stacey Campfield Loses Seat in Primary,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, August 7, 2014. Retrieved 14 August 2014. Defunding abortion provider Planned Parenthood In 2012 Campfield moved to have state funding removed from abortion provider Planned Parenthood and turned over to state health departments who do not perform abortions. The move was made as a budget amendment and removed millions of potential tax dollars from the abortion provider and sent them to the state health department. Tim Tebow bill In 2011 Campfield introduced legislation to allow homeschool students to try out for public school sports teams. The bill was branded the \\"Tim Tebow Bill\\" after Tim Tebow, winner of the Heisman Trophy while a quarterback for the Florida Gators, since Tebow was a homeschooled student who played high-school sports in a public school in Florida. The legislation passed. State tribal recognition for Native Americans  In three successive years, 2011‚ÄîSB 1802, 2012‚ÄîSB 2177, 2013‚ÄîSB 489, Campfield sponsored bills to grant state tribal recognition to six groups of not publicly documented Native American descendants,names of groups and year created according to Tennessee Secretary of State corporation records: \\"United Eastern Lenape Nation of Winfield\\" 1983, aka \\"Upper Cumberland Cherokee\\" 2012; \\"Central Band of Cherokee\\" 2000; \\"Cherokee Wolf Clan\\" 2003; \\"Remnant Yuchi Nation\\" 2007; \\"Chikamaka Band\\" 2009; \\"Tanasi Council\\" (of \\"Faraway Cherokee\\") 2010 which would have also appointed the six groups, known collectively as the \\"Confederation of Tennessee Native Tribes\\", as the means for other Native Americans not relocated during the \\"trail of tears\\" to receive state recognition as Native American Indian tribes. The bills were either withdrawn or died in committee. Campfield's sponsorship was seen as largely 'carrying water' for Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey in whose district one of the groups also resides and whose previous state representative Nathan Vaughn initiated the legislation in 2008. \\"Classroom protection\\" bill In 2011 as a senator, he revived his 2008 \\"pro traditional family education\\" bill as SB49, the so-called \\"Don't Say Gay\\" bill, and it gained national and international attention.Jones, Lawrence D.

January 12, 2012. Modification of \\"Classroom protection\\" bill In January 2013, Campfield introduced a modified version of his \\"Classroom protection act\\" bill. This version allows teachers and guidance counselors to answer a child's private questions about sexuality, but forces the counselors to tell the child's parents if those responses included activity that could be life-threatening or possible sexual abuse. Many gay rights advocates believed this information could result in the disclosure of a child's sexual orientation to their parents. State pet In 2014 Campfield passed legislation making rescue and shelter dogs and cats the official state pet of Tennessee. Campfield said the move was made to draw more people into adoption of rescue and shelter dogs and cats. Decreased welfare to parents who are not involved with their failing child's education In 2013, Campfield introduced Senate Bill 0132, which cuts by 30% the payment made to parents or caretakers of children in families eligible for Tennessee's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program if any of the children fail to meet requirements for grades or attendance and the parent refused to go to any parent teacher conferences, parent counseling or to enroll their child in free tutoring programs. In April 2013, Campfield postponed this Bill after an organized protest by community activists at the State Capitol. Eight-year-old Aamira Fetuga followed him around Capitol Hill with a signed petition opposing the bill while asking him questions and sharing her concerns. Campfield said \\"Children should not be used as props to push their parents agenda.\\" The bill was postponed shortly thereafter but was passed the next year with stronger requirements and tougher restrictions. Other news events Campfield has appeared or been quoted on multiple national, international news broadcasts and media outlets for his legislation as well as his outspoken, and often creative conservative views. Among the broadcasts: TMZ, CNN with Wolf Blitzer, Pierce Morgan and Martin Bashir, The O'Reilly Factor with Bill O'Reilly, Morning Joe with Joe Scarborough, NBC's \\"Tonight Show\\" with Jay Leno. \\"The View\\", Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", \\"The Colbert Report\\" allegedly, \\"South Park\\" which had an episode regarding his exclusion from the Black Caucus, Rush Limbaugh, Allan Colmes, Michael Reagan, USA Today, NewsWeek, The Washington Times, as well as others. Musicals and Plays To date there have been two musicals and one play written about Campfield and his life in the legislature. The most recent one sold out for multiple nights and received strong reviews from multiple Tennessee newspapers. While not portraying him in a positive light, Campfield himself quipped he was glad he could support the arts and was even willing to do a cameo role. Duncan Barbecue In 2002, at one of Republican Congressman Jimmy Duncan's annual barbecues, Campfield followed candidate for Governor of Tennessee Phil Bredesen with a sign saying \\"Tax 'n' Spend Governor\\". He was forcibly removed by security after being attacked by a Bredesen supporter but was later allowed to come back into the event. Tax porn, not corn While a member of the House of Representatives Campfield put forward a bill to tax the sale of pornography, sex toys, strip clubs and escort services in the state and use the money to remove the sales tax on groceries. The Press dubbed it the \\"Tax porn not corn\\" bill. While garnering international acclaim from woman's rights groups the bill was quickly killed in the Democrat controlled house. The bill was later used in elections with success on Democrats who voted against the bill saying they either were against removing the tax on food or for discounts on pornography, strippers and escort services. 2009 UT Neyland Stadium football game On October 31, 2009, Campfield attended the Halloween Volunteers football game with the University of South Carolina at the University of Tennessee Neyland Stadium where he was briefly questioned, searched, and detained allegedly after the mother of two young girls complained that the presence of a masked Campfield had allegedly frightened two young girls. The girls had previously been told by UT stadium security that masks were not allowed to be worn inside the stadium for the Halloween football game). While Campfield was questioned in section B he was reported as only having stadium seating admission tickets for Section LL and was then escorted outside of the stadium by two UT deputies. Campfield later offered college scholarships to the two girls if they were ever identified. They never were. Several people accused UT legal council Ron Leadbetter of having a report made weeks later just to use in his campaign to unseat Campfield for the state house that same year. Campfield on the origin and transmission of AIDS In a January 2012 interview with Michelangelo Signorile, Campfield replied to a question on the history of AIDS \\"most people realize that AIDS came from the homosexual community ‚Äì it was one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men. It was an airline pilot, if I recall.... My understanding is that it is virtually ‚Äì not completely, but virtually ‚Äì impossible to contract AIDS through heterosexual sex...very rarely [transmitted].\\" He later quoted the odds of heterosexual vaginal transmission at 1 in 5 million. Medical authority sources disagree: \\"When risk is assessed per act of unprotected vaginal intercourse\\" (between an infected male and a female partner), \\"the chance of HIV transmission is estimated to be between 1 in 500 and 1 in 1000.\\" Campfield said the numbers quoted by him were for transmission to heterosexual US males through vaginal intercourse, with protection, multiplied by the odds of actually having sex with an AIDS infected, heterosexual female partner in the US. Those odds were roughly 1 in 5 million. Although there is no definitive origin or \\"Patient 0\\" many assume, contrary to Campfield's statement, HIV's various distinct strains may possibly have come about in humans on numerous separate occasions because of the handling and consumption of bushmeat infected with Simian immunodeficiency virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. while not being able to completely refute his claim Health experts expressed concern about the possible health consequences of Campfield's remarks. Campfield's \\"airline pilot\\" reference likely referred to the case of Ga√´tan Dugas, a flight attendant who was falsely referred to as \\"Patient Zero\\", by the late Randy Shilts in his 1987 book on the modern US outbreak of AIDS, And The Band Played On. When later asked about his comments, Campfield said that some of his comments were taken out of context, saying that \\"I'm not a historian on AIDS ... but I've read and seen what other people have read and seen and those facts and numbers, in context, are out there and even backed up by the CDC numbers.\\" Bistro at the Bijou in Knoxville On January 29, 2012, the owner of the cafe Bistro at the Bijou, Martha Boggs in Knoxville asked Stacey Campfield to leave the restaurant as a stand for gay rights. He was asked to leave because of his assertion that HIV is seldom transmitted through heterosexual sex and because Boggs believed his comments to be homophobic. Campfield was defended on \\"The View\\" by Whoopie Goldburg. Intellectual property Since March 2005, Campfield has maintained a public blog that includes a warning that any quotation from it for print will be charged at \\"$1,000 USD per word\\". Gun politics In 2013 Campfield appeared on CNN with Piers Morgan and debated gun rights and a possible gun ban in the USA. Campfield called gun control a failure and at one point asked when Morgan planned to fulfill his promise to leave the USA if gun control failed. Morgan said he would \\"Wait and see\\". Campfield would later move to stop local municipalities from implementing second amendment restrictions beyond what the state had implemented saying the state constitution only allows the legislature to regulate the wearing of arms and that \\"constitutional freedoms should be protected at all levels, not struck down at the lowest level. We should no more accept local restrictions on the second amendment than we do the first\\". Drug testing for government benefits In 2012 Campfield authored legislation requiring suspicion based drug testing for those receiving cash government benefits. Those failing the test were referred to drug treatment centers but were allowed to stay on government benefits if they continued drug treatment and remained drug-free for 6 months. If they failed another drug test at the end of 6 months they would be banned from the program for 1 year. Early testing results showed an 18% failure rate of those tested for drugs. All of the money saved by the drug testing program remained in the assistance program to help others that qualified. Obamacare Holocaust comparison On May 5, 2014, Campfield drew widespread criticism for a blog post comparing mandatory signups under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to the \\"train rides\\" the Jews took under Nazi Germany (\\"Democrats bragging about the number of mandatory sign ups for Obamacare is like Germans bragging about the number of mandatory sign ups for 'train rides' for Jews in the 40s.\\"). Campfield responded to the criticism saying it missed his point about \\"government mandates and bureaucrats deciding who should be given life saving medications and who should be denied\\" and government funding for abortion.Campfield regrets comparing Obamacare to Nazi train ride by Chas Sisk May 5, 2014 The Tennessean Merry Christmas bill In 2014 Campfield passed legislation protecting schools, teachers and students from possible prosecution for using traditional winter holiday greetings or displays. The bill allowed for religious symbols and greetings to be used as long as more than one religion was recognized by the school. The legislation received condemnation from groups like the ACLU and the Freedom From Religion Foundation who sent letters to schools threatening legal action previous to the bill's passage.

It was formed to operate both local trains and through-service Canadian Pacific Railway trains between Sudbury, Ontario and Smiths Falls, Ontario. On July 23, 2012, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. announced that it intended to purchase RailAmerica in a deal valued at $1.39 billion. Approval of the purchase was granted by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board on December 19, 2012.Surface Transportation Board, Decision, Case No. 42772, December 19, 2012 Currently, the OVR operates between Sudbury and Temiscaming, Quebec, reduced from its original routing between Sudbury and Smiths Falls with a branch to Temiscaming. The rerouting came about as a result of the reduction of both local traffic on the line and through traffic operated by the Canadian Pacific. As traffic was reduced on other CP routes, that railway was able to redirect trains onto its lines through Toronto, and RailAmerica's lease on the line to the east of Petawawa, Ontario ended in December 2009. The OVR continued operating the route between Sudbury and Temiscaming, and in early October 2010, RailAmerica and CP reached a new agreement under which those operations would continue, while CP would continue procedures for ending service to the east of Mattawa. On 3 August 2011, it was announced that the rails between Renfrew and Pembroke, Ontario were planned to be removed by the end of the year, with the remainder of the Mattawa--Smiths Falls route to be removed in following years. The OVR interchanges with the Canadian Pacific at Sudbury, as well as with the Canadian National Railway at North Bay, Ontario, the Ontario Northland Railroad at North Bay, and the Huron Central Railway at Sudbury. The railway once hauled around 70,000 carloads a year, the majority of which came from CP's intermodal bridge traffic. The rest of it was self- generated, and included chemicals and forest products. Very little of this traffic came from east of Mattawa. As of 2013, carloadings amount to approximately 8,000 per year.

Taxonomy and etymology The Snares Island snipe is one of a group of birds of sometimes disputed relationships in the genus Coenocorypha. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Subantarctic snipe (Coenocorypha aucklandica), but has since been elevated to a full species. The taxon was first described by the Reverend Henry Baker Tristram as Gallinago huegeli, with the specific epithet honouring British and Austrian naturalist Anatole von H√ºgel who collected it. The Maori name, ‚Äútutukiwi‚Äù, which may be applied to other Coenocorypha snipes as well, alludes to the bird's fancied resemblance in appearance and behaviour to a miniature kiwi. Description The snipe is a small, chunky and cryptically patterned wader with bars, stripes and spots in shades of brown ranging from buffy-white to nearly black, with longitudinal stripes on the face and crown. It has a long bill, with a short neck and tail. The outer tail feathers are narrow and stiffened, a modification to produce the distinctive roaring sound of the nocturnal ‚Äúhakawai‚Äù aerial display. The sexes of the snipe are similar in appearance, though females are slightly larger than the males with weights of about 116 g compared with the males‚Äô 101g, and with bills around 57 mm in length compared with 55 mm. Compared with males, the females have olive rather than yellow coloured legs, and with mottling on the inner edges of the primary coverts rather than having no such markings. The males also have more strongly contrasting dorsal markings. Juveniles are duller in colouration. In sexing the snipe, researchers on the Snares have found that, although no single character is diagnostic, in combination they allow most birds to be assigned to age and sex classes. Walter Oliver, in his New Zealand Birds (1955), says ‚ÄúThe Snares Island snipe is distinguished by the under surface being barred all over which is not the case with any other subspecies. The general colour also is more reddish than in the others.‚Äù Distribution and habitat The snipe is endemic to the Snares Islands, a small subantarctic island group, with a total surface area of 3.5 km 2, some 200 km south of New Zealand in the Southern Ocean. There it breeds on North East and Broughton Islands, and has been recorded on Alert Stack. The species has also been introduced to Putauhinu Island. Its favoured habitat is the moist floor beneath Olearia and Brachyglottis forest, with a ground layer of grass tussocks, sedges, mat- forming herbs and Polystichum vestitum shield ferns. Behaviour Edgar Stead reported on a visit to the Snares in December 1947 by saying of the snipe: > \\"When flushed in the daytime it runs for a few feet then stands still > silently regarding the intruder. They are reluctant to fly during the > daytime and when they do it is not for more than ten or fifteen yards and > often for only two or three. At night they fly more readily and for > considerable distances. Their food apparently consists chiefly of worms. > Always snipe are to be found on the outskirts of penguin colonies. Their > laying season commenced at the beginning of December. Nests were found in > the heart of big tussocks of Poa foliosa about one foot above ground level. > The nests were deep cups of fine grass 9 ¬Ω cm wide by 7 cm deep, and > contained a good deal of material.\\" Breeding Most of the snipe breed in monogamous pairs, which hold breeding territories, with both parents sharing incubation duties of the two- egg clutch, in a nest concealed in dense ground vegetation. When the chicks hatch they weigh 14-18 g and are precocial and nidifugous; the male parent looks after the first chick to leave the nest, while the female takes care of the second. The chicks remain with their respective parents for about eight weeks, and are fed by them for the first two. They are capable of flight at about 30 days old. Feeding The snipe feed on a variety of small invertebrates, including annelids, amphipods, spiders and insects, obtained by probing with their long bills in the soil and leaf litter. Status and conservation The total population of the species in the Snares is estimated at just over 400 pairs. On 16 April 2005 thirty snipe were translocated from North East Island in the Snares to 141 ha Putauhinu Island, in order to establish an insurance population against the possibility of the Snares being threatened by the accidental introduction of terrestrial predators. Putauhinu lies in the south-western chain of the Titi Islands, near Stewart Island. It lies 1.5 km west of Big South Cape Island, which was the final refuge for the now extinct South Island snipe (Coenocorypha iredalei).

The school building, located at Dalmorton Road, New Brighton, was officially opened by The Right Hon. Augustine Birrell KC (Secretary of State for Ireland and formerly Education). The school opened on 11th August 1908 with 7 staff and 153 boys with Mr William Charles Simeon Jones as Principal. The first school inspection took place in 1910 and the recommendation was made for larger premises to accommodate the growth of the local population. In 1920 the school moved to Coronation Avenue, Wallasey, and was renamed Wallasey Boys Central School. It was one of the few Technical Schools established after the Education Act 1944. In 1956 a purpose-built school was built at Mosslands Drive, Wallasey Village. The building, plate glass in construction, was opened by glass mogul Sir Harry Pilkington. The school was renamed the Secondary Technical School for Boys.https://www.mosslands.co.uk/page/?title=1908+%2D+1958&pid;=27 By 1959 the school population was around 500 with 20 members of staff. The school was established as the only Technical Grammar School in the country. In 1961 J D Petit became headmaster and the house system was introduced. The school took on the Middle School system and changed its name for the fourth time to Mosslands Senior Comprehensive. New headmaster William Mitchell later reorganised the school to 11 to 18 and it became known as The Mosslands School. The school occupied two sites (Mosslands Drive and a lower school annexe for years 7 and 8) with a population of 1250 boys, a mixed sixth form and over 100 members of staff. Headmaster Mr Gordon Fair took the school to a single site and a large rebuild took place, equipping the school with science laboratories, art studios, music suites, computer rooms and a library. In 2004 The Mosslands School became a specialist Technology College.https://www.mosslands.co.uk/page/?pid=28 House system Pupils at Mosslands are sorted into one of three school houses. The houses are eponymously named Faraday, Grenfell and Ruskin after Michael Faraday, Sir Wilfred Grenfell and John Ruskin respectively.

Omega, 903 N.E.2d 73 (Ind.App. 2009),Attaway v. Omega, 903 N.E.2d 73 (Ind.App. 2009) was a decision by the Indiana Court of Appeals in which the Court found personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who bought a car on eBay then rescinded payment. Factual Background and Procedural History In 2006 Llexcyiss Omega and Dale York, Indiana residents, sold a Porsche to Marlene Attaway (‚ÄúAttaway‚Äù), Idaho resident, on eBay. Attaway submitted payment through PayPal and the amount was charged to Attaways‚Äô MasterCard account. Attaway then hired an auto transporter to pick up the car from Indiana and deliver it to her Idaho residence. When the car was delivered, Attaway felt it was ‚Äúsignificantly not as described‚Äù in the eBay listing and filed a claim asking for a refund. Her claim was denied. However, she was able to convince MasterCard to rescind the payment. Omega and York filed suit against Attaway demanding payment. Attaway filed an answer and motioned to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction before the Clay County, Indiana small claims court. That court denied the motion to dismiss. Car was returned to seller at Attaway's expense and was supposedly sold at auction. No proceeds were determined. Issue Whether the Indiana court has personal jurisdiction over an Idaho defendant who rescinded payment on an online auction? Court‚Äôs Analysis The Court breaks its analysis down into two components: United States Supreme Court personal jurisdiction precedent and specific cases, in other jurisdictions, regarding eBay sales and personal jurisdiction. The Court summarizes the law of federal personal jurisdiction. International Shoe v. Washington the Supreme Court established that a nonresident defendant must have ‚Äúcertain minimum contacts with the forum state that does not offend tradition notions of fair play and substantial justice.International Shoe v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945). Furthermore, there are two types of personal jurisdiction, general and specific. Contacts which are ‚Äúcontinuous and systematic‚Äù may subject the defendant to general jurisdiction.Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408 (1984). Specific jurisdiction requires that the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state and that he should reasonably anticipate being hauled into court there.Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474-75 (1985). If the defendant's contacts are sufficient to find either general or specific jurisdiction then the court must ask if personal jurisdiction would comport with ‚Äúfair play and substantial justice.‚Äù The Supreme Court set forth five factors in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1) burden on defendant; (2) forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (3) plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; (4) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and (5) shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive shared policies.Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476-77 (1985). The court then proceeds to analyze the case law of other jurisdictions regarding the same legal issue. In Dedvukaj v. Maloney,Dedvukaj v. Maloney, 477 F.Supp.2d 813 (E.D.Mich. 2006). a Michigan buyer sued a New York seller for breach of contract, fraud, and misrepresentation when the seller accepted buyer's payment but did not ship the items described in two eBay auction listings. The court considered many factors, and found that the seller had purposely availed itself of acting in Michigan. The court also discusses another eBay case, Boschetto v. Hansing,Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir.2008). in which a California buyer purchased a car from a Wisconsin seller via eBay. The buyer arranged for the car to be picked up and delivered to California. When the car arrived, the buyer found the vehicle to be in poor condition. The court dismissed the motion for lack of personal jurisdiction reasoning that the seller did not specifically direct his sale to California residents. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The opinion also cites Machulsky v. Hall,Machulsky v. Hall, 210 F.Supp.2d 531 (D.N.J.2002). a case where an Oregon buyer purchased a set of coins from a New Jersey seller on eBay. The buyer upon receipt of the coin set claimed it was not the set he had ordered and shipped it back to the seller. A lawsuit resulted and the court found that a single purchase, without more, is not sufficient to exercise personal jurisdiction. Decision The Indiana Court of Appeals held, that although the present case does revolve around a single eBay purchase, there is personal jurisdiction and that it comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The court reasons that because the Attaways agreed to pick up the vehicle in Indiana, hired an auto shipping company to go to Indiana as their representative, pick up the car, and deliver it to Idaho, that the transaction was really more than just a single online purchase. Thus, the Attaways purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state. The Court then considers the factors set forth in Burger King Corp v. Rudzewicz. The burden on the Attaways is no greater than the burden on Omega and York if they were forced to bring this case in Idaho. Furthermore, it is unclear whether travel expenses or inconvenience would be greater if the case is tried in Indiana. When weighing the interests of the states, ‚Äúit is certainly within the bounds of fair play and substantial justice to allow Indiana to exercise personal jurisdiction over individuals who have entered into a contract with an Indiana resident for the purchase of property located in Indiana, have removed that property from the state of Indiana, and then rescinded payment.‚Äù  References  Category:United States personal jurisdiction case law Category:Indiana state case law Category:2009 in United States case law Category:2009 in Indiana Category:EBay litigation Category:Clay County, Indiana Category:Law articles needing an infobox ","title":"Attaway v.

He was not permitted to bring a sports trainer, but was instead accompanied by a political agent to ensure that he did not stray from his nation's communist ideology. He achieved his personal best time of 49 seconds at 400 metres the following year. Throughout his career he set over twenty national records at various sprint distances. Later life After his competitive period ended, Raƒçiƒç chose to pursue athletics as lifelong work.

In addition to roles in his native country, he also coached in Sweden and Kuwait. He was eventually certified as an international athletics judge, a role in which, as of 2009, he continues to serve. On the administrative side he worked on committees that helped organize the 1979 Mediterranean Games in Split, the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, and the 1987 Summer Universiade in Zagreb. In 1997 he became the only Slovenian to receive the Gold Badge of the European Athletic Association and in 2001 garnered recognition from the International Olympic Committee for his contribution to amateur sports. As of September 2010 he was the second-oldest living Slovenian Olympic athlete, behind Tone Pogaƒçnik,Karlo Umek died in 2010. and was working on a book detailing the history of Slovenian athletics based on his research as well as his personal experiences.

Spurred on by her mercenary and socially ambitious mother however, Genevieve consents to marry Daniel's wealthy brother Albert (Langhorn Burton). In despair, Daniel sinks into drug addiction. The marriage is not a success, and Genevieve feels ignored and neglected by Albert. She begins a flirtation with family friend Maurice Granger (Lewis Drayton) and the pair gradually fall in love. One day Genevieve decides to pay a call on Daniel, and by chance meets Maurice who is also visiting. Unknown to Genevieve, Albert has become suspicious of her and has followed her to Daniel's studio. He shows up in a fury, and Daniel manages to hide Genevieve and Maurice. Knowing that Genevieve has been there, Albert accuses his brother of being her lover and attacks him brutally.

While the standard of acting and the film's visuals were well-appreciated, it was generally felt that there were always going to be problems arising from trying to capture a wordy stage play in silent film form, with nuances of character and motivation inevitably being lost. A particular criticism was that the film's intertitles were not only excessive in number, but also written in a slipshod, clumsy and ungrammatical style.

Subsequently, faced with material demands from Qin Zongquan, who had claimed imperial title, which Wang was unable to meet, Wang Xu forced the people and the soldiers of Guang Prefecture to abandon it and follow him in heading south to modern Fujian. Wang Xu was then overthrown by his subordinate Wang Chao, who eventually took over Fujian and whose family established the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Min.  Background and takeover of Guang Prefecture  It is not known when Wang Xu was born, but it is known that he was from Shou Prefecture (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), and that he was a butcher. In 881, when the Tang realm was overrun by agrarian rebellions ‚Äî the chief among which was the one led by Huang Chao, who went as far as capturing the imperial capital Chang'an (forcing then-reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu) and declaring himself the emperor of a new state of Qi ‚Äî Wang rose with his brother-in-law Liu Xingquan () and, with their 500 men, seized control of Shou Prefecture. After a month, they also captured Guang Prefecture. Wang claimed the title of general, and his army grew to over 10,000 men. At that time, Qin Zongquan was the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). Qin recommended to Emperor Xizong that Wang be made the prefect of Guang Prefecture, and Emperor Xizong agreed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254.  Flight south to Fujian  Later on, however, Qin Zongquan had turned against the Tang imperial government and was on the cusp of claiming imperial title himself. He ordered Wang Xu to pay taxes to him. When Wang was unable to do so, he launched an army to attack Wang. Wang, in fear, gathered 5,000 soldiers from Guang and Shou Prefectures and forced the people to cross the Yangtze River to the south. His army roved through and pillaged Jiang (Ê±üÂ∑û, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi), Hong (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), and Qian (ËôîÂ∑û, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) Prefectures. By spring 885, Wang had continued south and captured Ting (Ê±ÄÊ¥≤, in modern Longyan, Fujian) and Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures, but was not able to hold either for long.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  Overthrow by Wang Chao and death  By the time that Wang Xu reached Zhang Prefecture, his army was running low on food. As the terrain in Fujian Circuit (Á¶èÂª∫, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), which Zhang Prefecture belonged to, was rugged, he ordered that the old and the weak be abandoned. However, in violation of his order, his discipline officer Wang Chao and Wang Chao's brothers Wang Shengui () and Wang Shenzhi continued to take their mother Lady Dong with them. Wang Xu rebuked them and threatened to put Lady Dong to death. They begged for Lady Dong's life, offering to die in her stead. Other officers also spoke on their behalf, and Wang Xu relented. Meanwhile, by this point, Wang Xu had also become extremely paranoid, as he had been warned by a sorcerer that there was qi belonging to a king in his army, so he began to put to death anyone whom he considered to have talents surpassing his own ‚Äî going as far as putting Liu Xingquan to death. The fact that Wang was willing to put someone as close to him as Liu to death terrified the other officers. When the army reached Na'an (ÂçóÂÆâ, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), Wang Chao persuaded Wang Xu's forward commander, who feared that he would be Wang Xu's next target, into turning against Wang Xu. The forward commander and Wang Chao thus laid an ambush for Wang Xu and, when he was caught off-guard, arrested him. Wang Chao initially wanted to support the forward commander to be the new leader, but the forward commander pointed out that it was Wang Chao's idea that allowed them to survive Wang Xu's cruelty, and so the army agreed to have Wang Chao become their leader. Wang Chao initially wanted to take the army back north to their home in Guang Prefecture, but when they advanced to Sha (Ê≤ôÁ∏£, in modern Sanming, Fujian), the locals, who were suffering under the heavy burdens of the local prefect (Liao Yanruo () the prefect of Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou), asked that Wang Chao save them from Liao. Wang Chao thus put Quan Prefecture under siege, capturing it in fall 886. After doing so, he put Wang Xu under house arrest at a mansion. Wang Xu, unable to bear this shame, committed suicide.

Henry (March 30, 1921 ‚Äì September 30, 2010) was an American Democratic politician and academic. Henry was mayor of St. Cloud, Minnesota, for two terms, from 1964 to 1971. He later served as the president of several colleges and universities. Henry was the first lay and male president of Saint Mary's College, a Catholic women's college in Indiana, from 1972 to 1974. He then became president of Saint Michael's College (in Colchester, Vermont), serving from 1976 to 1985. Henry later became the 8th president of Marian University (Fond du Lac, Wisconsin), then called Marian College of Fond du Lac, serving from 1986 to 1989. He also served as president of Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina from 1989 to 1990. Biography=Early life and education Henry was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, in 1921. He graduated from Cathedral High School and in 1943 received his bachelor's degree from St. John's University, an all-male college in Collegeville, Minnesota. He attended Harvard University as a graduate student. He later obtained his master's degree in political science, his MBA, and his doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago. Career Henry enlisted as a United States Naval officer during World War II. After the war he returned to St. Cloud, where he worked as a political science professor at St. John's University for 19 years. Henry chaired the political science department from 1954 to 1971. He later became Vice President of St. John's and the founder of the school's development department. Mayor of St. Cloud Henry served two terms as mayor of his native St. Cloud, from 1964 to 1971. He chaired the St. Cloud school board during the 1960s. In 2010, the St. Cloud Times described Henry as \\"one of the most influential mayors in St. Cloud history\\". During his tenure as mayor, Henry founded Tri-CAP, the first anti-poverty program to encompass several towns and other municipalities in the rural United States. He spearheaded the relocation of the St. Cloud Regional Airport, the creation of the St. Cloud Housing Authority and the development and construction of what became the Municipal Athletic Complex. Henry negotiated an agreement to annex the Crossroads Center shopping mall to the city of St. Cloud. The mall had been part of an adjacent township before the annexation. Henry oversaw a civic development program that culminated in St. Cloud receiving an All-America City Award in 1973, after he had left office. He is credited with founding the Center for the Study of Local Government, the first small-city research center in the United States, at St. John's University. The center, founded with a grant from the Ford Foundation, operated from 1968 to 1979. His successor as mayor, Al Loehr, who served from 1971 to 1980, credited Henry with laying the foundations for the development of St. Cloud's downtown area. Academic presidencies Henry was appointed the first male lay President of Saint Mary's College in March 1972, shortly after Saint Mary's ended a proposed merger with the University of Notre Dame. Notre Dame had begun admitting women in the early 1970s, which hurt Saint Mary's enrollment. Shortly after taking over the presidency, Henry told a local newspaper, \\"I would not have accepted the presidency if I didn't see a great future for Saint Mary's.\\" He announced his resignation as president of Saint Mary's in January 1974. Enrollment at Saint Mary's College increased 150% during his administration. In 1976, Henry became president of Saint Michael's College, a Roman Catholic college in Colchester, Vermont, where he served as president until his retirement in 1985. His retirement from the academic world did not last long. He became the eighth president of Marian College in July 1986. Under his administration, enrollment increased at the college and the Townhouse Village residence facilities were constructed in 1988. Henry spearheaded the creation of the first graduate program at Marian and the implementation of an evening and weekend degree completion program. He left Marian in June 1989. He served as the interim President of Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina from 1989 to 1990. Author Henry authored two books, including Micropolis in Transition (1971), a study of St. Cloud. Death Henry died in Roseville, Minnesota, on September 30, 2010, aged 89. He was survived by nine children and two brothers. He was predeceased by his wife of 56 years, Elizabeth Anne \\"Betty\\" Henry, who died in 2004.

Background  The Roman general and longtime consul Gaius Marius had gained great prominence during the 2nd century BC, particularly as a result of his campaign against the rebelling African king Jugurtha.Bailey, Ann Howard, John Bowman, Ormonde de Kay, et al. The Universal History of the World, Vol. III, Ancient Rome. Golden Press, New York 1966 The campaign was successful, and Marius was rewarded with re-election as consul and a triumph. However, to his disappointment, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, one of his officers, was given credit for Jugurtha's capture.Marius and Sulla. Yaggyslatin.com. Retrieved on 2010-10-13. In Asia, Mithradates, king of Pontus, began to attack regions that had been annexed by Rome. He also infiltrated his agents into Roman-held cities, which caused popular uprisings and vicious riots that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Romans. The Roman governors, however, had few soldiers to stop him with, for Rome was embroiled in the Social War against Italian city-states in the south.  Sulla's first civil war  Both Marius and Sulla distinguished themselves commanding legionaries in the Social War, and, when it was concluded, the Senate was forced to choose one of them to command the army that would be sent against Mithradates. In light of Sulla's recent election as consul, the Senate appointed him to the command, and Marius, now nearing seventy, was furious. He appealed to the mob, which turned out in his support and eventually marched on the Senate, threatening to kill Sulla. Sulla fled, sailing to Greece, where the Mithradatic War veterans had maintained their loyalty to him. The army was transported to Italy, and, with Sulla at its head, marched on Rome. Marius, with a hastily formed army, attempted to defend the city, but, after a few hours of street-fighting,Marius and Sulla. Janusquirinus.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-13. Marius was driven out and Sulla installed as sole Roman ruler. Sulla sailed across the Mediterranean yet again and pursued the campaign against Mithradates, restoring Roman rule to the eastern provinces. However, the senators in Rome, now in complete control of the city, turned against Sulla in 87 BC. They invited Marius to return, and he hurried back, beginning a brief period of terror. Marius became so powerful that, if he failed to nod to one who spoke to him, his soldiers would kill the unfortunate man. Marius was an old man, though, and seventeen days into his seventh consulship, he died. Marius' key ally and supporter, Cinna was left as sole consul. Meanwhile, across the Mediterranean, Sulla ensured the loyalty of his troops and prepared for a second voyage to Rome. The frightened senators attempted to negotiate with him, but Cinna was resolved to fight. He was murdered by mutinous troops, and Sulla broke off negotiations with the Senate.  Sulla's second civil war  Backed by an army of 40,000, Sulla landed at Brundisium in 83 BC. Led by Marius' son, Marian veterans in Rome prepared to fight Sulla. However, by 80 BC, they had been defeated and young Marius had committed suicide. Sulla was reinstated as Dictator of Rome. At his command, hundreds of Marius' former supporters, along with those regarded as critical of Sulla and his actions, were put to the sword. After the second civil war, Sulla was not challenged by Marian supporters during the last year of his life, 79 BC. When he died, his allies organized a large funeral, at which his body was cheered by the entire crowd. According to one source, his friends applauded him because of their respect and his enemies because he was dead.

But Honey marked his complete crossover to such an approach.

A total of thirty-seven United States Navy personnel were killed or later died as a result of the attack, and twenty-one were injured. Incident Damage to s hull and superstructure was part of the Middle East Task Force assigned to patrol off the Saudi Arabian coast near the Iran‚ÄìIraq War exclusion boundary. The United States Central Command identified the attacking aircraft as an Iraqi Dassault Mirage F1 fighter.DOD Letter, 23 July 1987, Subject: Formal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the attack on the USS Stark (GGG) on 17 May 1987 (U) Initially not alarmed, at 22:09 Captain Glenn R. Brindel ordered a radioman to send the message: \\"Unknown aircraft, this is U.S. Navy warship on your 078 (degrees) for twelve miles. Request you identify yourself.\\" The Iraqi Mirage pilot did not respond to the message. The ship's captain ordered a second message sent, to which there was no reply. At 22:10 hrs Captain Brindel was informed the Iraqi aircraft had targeted his ship, locking his Cyrano-IV fire-control radar onto Stark. The Mirage then fired the first Exocet missile from the ship, and the second Exocet from . The pilot then banked left and began to withdraw. Starks search radar and ESM systems failed to detect the incoming missiles. The first Exocet missile struck the port side of the ship near the bridge. Although it failed to detonate, rocket fuel ignited and caused a large fire that quickly spread throughout the ship's post office, storeroom, and the critical combat operations center (where the ship's weapons are controlled). The second Exocet also struck the port side. This missile detonated, leaving a hole in the frigate's left side. Electronics for Starks Standard Missile defense went out and Captain Brindel could not order his men to return fire. An AWACS plane was still in the area and just after witnessing the attack, radioed a nearby Saudi airbase to send aircraft for an interception, but the ground controllers did not have the authority to order a sortie and the Iraqi jet left unharmed. The USN (United States Navy) rules of engagement applicable at the time allowed Stark to defend herself after sufficiently warning the hostile aircraft. A total of 37 crew were killed in the attack, 29 from the initial explosion and fire, including two lost at sea. Eight would later die from their injuries. Twenty-one others survived their wounds. Captain Brindel ordered the starboard side flooded to keep the hole on the hull's port side above water. This helped prevent the Stark from sinking. Brindel quickly dispatched a distress call after the first missile hit. It was received by , which was in the area, and with two-thirds of its crew on liberty in Bahrain. Waddell and Conyngham arrived to provide damage control and relief to Starks crew. Also, the Pentagon said that an Iranian helicopter had joined a Saudi Arabian vessel in rescue operations.The Guardian article, 19 May 1987, Title: US navy ordered to hit back after Exocet kills 28 Aftermath Stark arrived at Bahrain the following day, 18 May 1987. There she was temporarily repaired by the destroyer tender before setting a course for Mayport Naval Station, Florida, the ship's home port. A court of inquiry under Rear Admiral Grant Sharp was formed to investigate the incident and later Captain Brindel was recommended for court-martial but was ultimately only reprimanded. It was found that Stark was outside the exclusion zone and had not violated neutrality as the Iraqis claimed. Iraq apologized, and Saddam Hussein said that the pilot mistook Stark for an Iranian tanker. American officials claimed that the Iraqi jet's pilot was not acting under orders from his government and that he was later executed. This has been disputed, as an Iraqi Air Force officer later stated that the pilot was not punished and that he was still alive. Iranian Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi called it a \\"divine blessing\\" and reiterated the standard Iranian view that the Persian Gulf \\"is not a safe place for the superpowers and it is in their interest not to enter this quicksand\\". Iraq Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iraq would never intentionally attack any target in the Gulf unless it was Iranian, and laid the blame on Iran. Washington used the incident to pressure Iran, which it later blamed for the whole situation. President Reagan said \\"We've never considered them [Iraq's military] hostile at all\\", and \\"the villain in the piece is Iran\\".Doug Rossinow, The Reagan Era: A History of the 1980s, Columbia University Press, 2015, , page 276 The Joint Chiefs of Staff investigation into the incident recommended that Iraq be held accountable, a finding the government of Iraq eventually complied with. Captain Brindel was relieved of duty and retired as a Commander for not defending his ship and Tactical Action Officer Lieutenant Basil E. Moncrief resigned. Claims On 21 June 2011, an agreement was reached between the governments of the United States and Iraq regarding claims of United States citizens against the regime of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi government established a fund of $400 million to compensate prisoners of war and hostages in the Persian Gulf War, and those killed or injured in the 1987 attack on Stark. The U.S. Department of State was to establish a mechanism to process applications for compensation. Memorials The memorial plaque for the killed American sailors at Mayport, Florida On 22 May 1987, a eulogy was given by president Ronald Reagan at Mayport Naval Station, Jacksonville, Florida. A ceremony is held at Mayport Naval Station on 17 May each year to remember the 37 men who died in the incident. The ceremony in 2012 was the 25th anniversary of the attack.

It is located west- northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The control center station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. History Murphy Dome AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. It was one of the ten original aircraft control and warning sites constructed during the early 1950s to establish a permanent air defense system in Alaska. Murphy Dome was initially operated by a detachment of the 532nd Aircraft Control and Warning Group, Ladd AFB (now Fort Wainwright). The station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft at Ladd AFB toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Radars operated were an AN/CPS-6B, AN/FPS-8, AN/FPS-20, and an AN/FPS-6. The station site consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, pool tables, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. An apartment building, separate from the connected buildings, provided homes for civilian families of civil service employees. A 4,500' airstrip was constructed on a plateau east of the ground support station, with a gravel runway during 1951 . It appears to have been abandoned when reliable roads were constructed which linked the station into the Alaska highway system. Mail was usually delivered daily after the road connection to Fairbanks was completed. During the 1950s-70s, a ski slope also operated at the site, the trails still visible in aerial photography . A rope tow was constructed to allow for servicemembers to go up and down the slope. When the 532nd was inactivated in 1951, the site was then operated by a detachment of the 143rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Alaska Air National Guard. As part of HQ Alaskan Air Command's (HQ AAC) plan to upgrade all remote sites to full squadrons, the 744th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Murphy Dome on 1 February 1953 with an authorized strength of 249 personnel. Murphy Dome converted to an air defense Direction Center (later renamed NORAD Control Center) on 4 March 1953, and exercised control over Campion AFS (GCI); Indian Mountain AFS, Tin City AFS and Cape Lisburne AFS (surveillance). Beginning in 1958, the Fort Yukon AFS and Kotzebue AFS Ground Intercept Sites were added when they were activated. As an MCC site, its mission was to feed air defense data to the Alaskan Control Center at Elmendorf AFB where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. The station also operated a number of radars, including AN/CPS-6B, AN/FPS-8, AN/FPS-20, and AN/FPS-6. Communications were initially provided by a White Alice TD-2 microwave A Route radio link to Clear AFS operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS) . It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. With the creation of NORAD in 1957, Murphy Dome AFS became one of four NORAD Control Centers in Alaska. The squadron supported, administered and trained assigned personnel to perform air defense missions, support tactical missions as directed by HQ AAC, and operate and maintain the station. The USAF shared its radars with the United States Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) for Nike missile-defense system (Fairbanks Defense Area). The AN/CPS-6B radar was removed in July 1958, the AN/FPS-8 was active until the Nike sites were inactivated in 1971. In 1977, the 744 ACWS was assigned to the newly reactivated 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (531 ACWG). The 531 ACWG was later redesignated the 11th Tactical Control Group (11 TCG) in 1981. In the early 1980s, construction began on a new NORAD Region Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB, which would be responsible for managing all air defense operations in Alaska, making all manned remote radar sites redundant. The 744th ACWS was selected to man the ROCC, which achieved full operational status on 15 September 1983. In 1983, Murphy Dome received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 744th ACWS was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Murphy Dome LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re-designation of AAC. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Demographics Murphy Dome appeared once on the U.S. Census in 1980 as a census-designated place (CDP) before its closure in 1983. Current status Today very little of the former Murphy Dome Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. It is generally unattended; a few civilian contractors access the site for maintaining the facilities.

The album also peaked #13 on the Top Independent albums charts. Music and lyrics The music of Truth Rising primarily fuses hard rock, heavy metal, hip hop, funk, reggae and punk rock. It also features elements of blues and industrial. Jared Gomes' vocal style ranges from melodic singing to rapping and death growls. The album continues the band's increasingly political lyrical message, drawing thematic material from the 9/11 Truth movement. Religion and sex are also discussed. Gomes states that the \\"truth\\" referred to in the album's title refers to \\"a lot of different things. One of it is trying to sift through all the political catch phrases and junk. There‚Äôs also the organized religion component, there‚Äôs the E.T. reality component and then there‚Äôs blind consumerism.

Sevendust singer Lajon Witherspoon contributed guest vocals to the song \\"Stand Up\\". Gomes described \\"Takeover\\" as a battle rap; he also stated that the lyrical themes were lighter than the rest of the album. Music videos The video for \\"It's All Over\\" was presented in September 2011https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKZ5T_65CJs as a plasticine animation. It shows the members of the band being made of plasticine and driving their car. It also has scenes in some house with Hed PE musicians binding a girl with ropes and killing a man with an angle grinder. Closer to the end it shows a battle between Jahred's character and some beast with a sword. Reviews 411mania gave the album a 6.5 rating, describing parts of the album as \\"disjointed\\"; the punk and hip hop tracks were deemed to be the weakest on the album. Allmusic wrote that \\"all the mishmashing makes Truth Rising even more inconsistent and alienating than usual.\\" Kik Axe Music gave the album 3 out of 5, stating that the sexual references in the latter part of the album diminished the sincerity of the band's message. OC Reloaded wrote, \\"Despite the overly profane lyrics used in a few select songs, Truth Rising has a lot to offer. The general message Hed PE sends about getting involved in socio- political matters is an admirable one. Whether or not you agree with Hed PE‚Äôs views, you should still get involved.

Features The Tyndall Range have a number of glacial lakes, the larger being Lake Huntley, Lake Rolleston, Lake Tyndall and Lake Matthew. The signs of the glaciation were first described by Thomas Bather Moore in 1894.

The show premiered on Tuesday, October 12, 2010, at 10 p.m. EST on Comedy Central and ran for two seasons, with the final first-run episode airing November 16, 2011.  Overview  Each episode would begin with Swardson doing stand-up comedy on stage, in front of an audience at a comedy club. He would tell jokes and discuss a topic which would be relevant to the episode. This would usually be something random about himself or about the show. The episode would then cut away to several pretaped sketches. The show featured comedic sketches, such as Wheelchair Cat, a masturbating sniper, and a parody of Nightmare on Elm Street involving incest- related dreams. Each episode from the first season included appearances from an animated character named Gay Robot, who originally appeared on Adam Sandler's comedy album Shh...Don't Tell. Gay Robot was voiced by Nick Swardson. All of the episode titles were named after Nick's favorite line from each episode. For instance, in the season one finale, a house owner asks their guest if they know what the address of the house is, and the guest replies sarcastically with \\"Um... I don't know... Blah Blah Blah Main Street?\\" The latter part of the line was chosen as the title for the seventh episode of the first season. The show was produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions, and comedian Horatio Sanz was one of the producers.

The statue is located in the state of Gujarat, India. It is the world's tallest statue with a height of . It is located on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam southeast of the city of Vadodara and from Surat.

An outreach drive named the Statue of Unity Movement was started to support the construction of the statue. It helped collect the iron needed for the statue by asking farmers to donate their used farming instruments. By 2016, a total of 135 metric tonnes of scrap iron had been collected and about 109 tonnes of it was used to make the foundation of the statue after processing. A marathon titled Run For Unity was held on 15 December 2013 in Surat and Vadodara in support of the project. Design and construction upright Design The statue depicts Vallabhbhai Patel, one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement, the first home minister as well as the first Deputy Prime Minister of independent India, and responsible for the integration of hundreds of princely states into the modern Republic of India. The Statue of Unity is an enlarged version of this statue in the Ahmedabad International Airport. After studying statues of Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics chose a design submitted by the Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar. The Statue of Unity is a much larger replica of a statue of the leader installed at Ahmedabad International Airport. Commenting on the design, Ram Sutar's son, Anil Sutar explains that, \\"the expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron will as well as kindness that his personality exudes. The head is up, a shawl flung from shoulders and hands are on the side as if he is set to walk\\". Three models of the design measuring , , and were initially created. Once the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D-scan was produced which formed the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a foundry in China. Patel's dhoti-clad legs and the use of sandals for footwear rendered the design thinner at the base than at the top thereby affecting its stability. This was addressed by maintaining a slenderness ratio of 16:19 rather than the customary 8:14 ratio of other tall buildings. The statue is built to withstand winds of up to and earthquakes measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale which are at a depth of 10 km and within a radius of 12 km of the statue. This is aided by the use of two 250 tonne tuned mass dampers ensuring maximum stability. The total height of the structure is , with a base of and the statue measuring . The height of 182 metres was specifically chosen to match the number of seats in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. Funding The Statue of Unity was built by a Public Private Partnership model, with most of the money raised by the Government of Gujarat. The Gujarat state government had allotted for the project in its budget from 2012 to 2015. In the 2014‚Äì15 Union Budget, was allocated for the construction of the statue. Funds were also contributed by Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social Responsibility scheme. Construction Statue of Unity under construction in August 2016 The statue under construction in January 2018 A consortium comprising Turner Construction, Michael Graves and Associates and the Meinhardt Group supervised the project. The project took 57 months to complete ‚Äì 15 months for planning, 40 months for construction and 2 months for handing over by the consortium. The total cost of the project was estimated to be about by the government. The tender bids for the first phase were invited in October 2013 and were closed in November 2013. Narendra Modi, then serving as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, laid the statue's foundation stone on 31 October 2013, the 138th anniversary of Patel's birth. Indian infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro won the contract on 27 October 2014 for its lowest bid of for the design, construction and maintenance of the statue. L&T; commenced the construction on 31 October 2014. In the first phase of the project, ‚Çπ1,347 crore was earmarked for the main statue, ‚Çπ235 crore for the exhibition hall and convention centre, ‚Çπ83 crore for the bridge connecting the memorial to the mainland and ‚Çπ657 crore for the maintenance of the structure for a duration of 15 years after its completion. The Sadhu Bet hillock was flattened from 70 metres to 55 metres to lay the foundation of the statue. L&T; employed over 3000 workers and 250 engineers in the statue's construction. The core of the statue used 210,000 cubic metres (7,400,000 cu ft) of cement and concrete, 6,500 tonnes of structural steel, and 18,500 tonnes of reinforced steel. The outer fa√ßade is made up of 1,700 tonnes of bronze plates and 1,850 tonnes of bronze cladding which in turn consists of 565 macro and 6000 micro panels. The bronze panels were cast in Jiangxi Tongqing Metal Handicrafts Co. Ltd (the TQ Art foundry) in China as facilities large enough for such casting were unavailable in India. The bronze panels were transported over sea and then by road to a workshop near the construction site where they were assembled. Local tribals belonging to the Tadvi tribe opposed the land acquisition for the development of tourism infrastructure around the statue. They have been offered cash and land compensation, and have been provided jobs. People of Kevadia, Kothi, Waghodia, Limbdi, Navagam, and Gora villages opposed the construction of the statue and demanded the restitution of the land rights over of land acquired earlier for the dam as well as for the formation of a new Garudeshwar subdistrict. They also opposed the formation of Kevadia Area Development Authority (KADA) and the construction of the Garudeshwar weir-cum-causeway project. The government of Gujarat accepted most of their demands. Construction of the monument was completed in mid-October 2018; and the inaugural ceremony was held on 31 October 2018 (143rd birth anniversary of Vallabhbhai Patel), and was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The statue has been described as a tribute to Indian engineering skills. Features Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the museum within the complex. The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue at . It rises higher than the previous record holder, the Spring Temple Buddha in China's Henan province. The previous tallest statue in India was the tall statue of Lord Hanuman at the Paritala Anjaneya Temple near Vijayawada in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The statue can be seen within a radius. The monument is constructed on a river island named Sadhu Bet, away from and facing the Narmada Dam downstream. The statue and its surroundings occupy more than , and are surrounded by a long artificial lake formed by the Garudeshwar weir downstream on the Narmada river. The statue is divided into five zones of which only three are accessible to the public. From its base to the level of Patel's shins is the first zone which has three levels and includes the exhibition area, mezzanine and roof. The first zone also contains a memorial garden and a museum. The second zone reaches up to Patel's thighs, while the third extends up to the viewing gallery at a height of 153 metres. The fourth zone is the maintenance area while the final zone comprises the head and shoulders of the statue. The museum in the first zone catalogues the life of Sardar Patel and his contributions. An adjoining audio-visual gallery provides a 15-minute long presentation on Patel and also describes the tribal culture of the state. The concrete towers which form the statue's legs contain two elevators each. Each lift can carry 26 people at a time to the viewing gallery in just over 30 seconds. The gallery is located at a height of and can hold up to 200 people. Tourism Over 128,000 tourists visited the statue in the 11 days after its opening to the public on 1 November 2018.

The band formed in September 2011 and performed their first gig in Dublin in November 2011. Having released singles under various labels between 2012 and 2013, the band signed to Fortuna Pop! in 2013 and released their debut album in January 2014. In Autumn 2014, ahead of their appearance at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, the band announced signing to Kanine Records, and an EP release through Kanine & Fortuna Pop! History=Formation, early years (2011‚Äì2013) September Girls formed following the break up of their previous band Talulah Does The Hula in September 2011, adding drummer Sarah Grimes to the band. The group took their name from the Big Star song 'September Gurls'. The change in name also resulted in a change in sound from the group with the five-piece taking inspiration from the garage rock scene and bands the members were listening to at the time. The group then began to perform live around the Irish and UK music scenes and would eventually release several stand alone singles. This included limited edition 7\\" vinyls such as 'Green Eyed' in 2012 and a Cassette Store Day 2013 release of 'Ships' through Manchester noise pop band PINS record label Haus of Pins. Both songs would end up featuring on their debut album. Debut album Cursing the Sea and Veneer EP (2014‚Äì2015) In January 2014 September Girls released their first studio album Cursing the Sea via independent record label Fortuna Pop!. The album featured the single 'Heartbeats' and was well received by critics upon its release; it holds a Metacritic score of 72. The group's tour in support of the album resulted in appearances at both the Body&Soul; and SXSW festivals. In the winter of 2014 the band would follow-up their debut record with the release of a four-track E.P. entitled Veneer through both Fortuna Pop! and Kanine Records. The record was compared favourably to Cursing the Sea and many critics regarding it as a marked improvement, with Lisa Wright of NME writing that \\"Where September Girls' debut earmarked them as the latest addition to the Dum Dum Girls/Vivian Girls school of Phil Spector worship, 'Veneer' finds the Irish quintet throwing off the '60s girl-group coyness in favour of something fiercer.\\" Second album Age of Indignation (2016‚Äìpresent) September Girls released their second studio album Age of Indignation in April 2016 via Fortuna Pop!. The album was preceded with the single and video 'Love No One' Age of Indignation holds a Metacritic score of 69. The group did a brief US West Coast tour alongside several SXSW shows. The band played a series of album launches in Ireland in April 2016, before released a second single/video for \\"Jaw on the Floor\\", featuring backing vocals from A Place to Bury Strangers' Oliver Ackermann.

Research on mortgage policy conducted by Maisel led to the expansion of the roles played by Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae in encouraging the broader availability of loans to homeowners. Maisel was born on July 8, 1918, in Buffalo, New York. After completing his undergraduate degree in economics from Harvard University in 1939, Maisel worked as a research economist working for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. He served in the United States Army during World War II beginning in 1941, attaining the rank of Captain by the time he completed his military service in 1945. After a brief career for the Foreign Service in Brussels, Maisel returned to Harvard, where he earned Master of Public Administration and a Master of Arts in economics in 1947 and 1948 and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1949.Chan, Sewell. \\"Sherman J. Maisel, Former Fed Governor, Dies at 92\\", The New York Times, October 6, 2010. Accessed October 7, 2010.Faculty and Executive Leadership Directory: Sherman J. Maisel , Haas School of Business. Accessed October 8, 2010. Hired by the Haas School of Business in 1948, Maisel helped establish the school's Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics.Staff. \\"Former Fed Governor and Berkeley Real Estate Professor Sherman Maisel Passes Away\\", Haas School of Business press release dated October 4, 2010. Maisel became involved in local politics, and was elected to the board of education of the Berkeley Unified School District, serving from 1962 to 1965. After the board approved a plan to address segregation in the district's junior high schools, Maisel faced and won a recall election, in which he encouraged students at the University of California, Berkeley to register and participate in the vote. When he was nominated to serve as a governor of the Federal Reserve System, he met with President Lyndon B. Johnson, who expressed more interest in the details of the Berkeley recall vote than in Maisel's opinions on economic policy. Research performed by Maisel concluded that the traditional pattern of local savings and loan associations making mortgage loans to home buyers exacerbated recessions because they were less willing to lend during economic downturns. As a member of a White House task force on mortgage policy, Maisel and his colleagues recommended that Ginnie Mae should provide guarantees for mortgage- backed securities and that Fannie Mae should be operated independently of the federal budget. These changes were intended to provide greater liquidity to the mortgage market, which would add to economic activity in up or down markets by making it easier to obtain mortgages. As a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research's senior research staff from 1978 to 1980, he worked on a project for the national Science Foundation that studied how government insurance of bank accounts effected capital and risk levels assumed by banks and other lending institutions. The group's findings exposed the moral hazard that existed based on the access to guaranteed funds and from the focus on book value rather than real net worth. The group's recommendations were not followed, and many of the changes the group opposed were implemented, factors that helped exacerbate the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and cost the federal government billions in rescue costs of bad loans. After his seven-year term expired in 1972, Maisel returned to California and resumed teaching at Haas until his retirement in 1986. He was a fellow of the American Finance Association, and was the organization's president in 1973. Maisel died in San Francisco at the age of 92 on September 29, 2010, due to respiratory failure. He was survived by his wife, Lucy Cowdin Maisel, who died on June 17th, 2019 from respiratory failure. Lucy and Sherman met in 1939 when they were both interns with the National Institute for Public Affairs. He was survived by a daughter, Margaret Maisel of Miami, Florida a son, Larry Maisel of London, England and two grandchildren Nicholas Maisel of Los Angeles, And Elena Horowitz of West Palm Beach, Florida.

History=Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010‚Äì2011) On the April 19, 2010, episode of Impact! Shannon Moore insulted the TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan, who was looking for a new tag team partner, provoking a rivalry between the two. The following week Morgan cost Moore his shot at the TNA X Division Championship and then went on to defend his own championship, teaming with Jesse Neal. After successfully defending the title, Morgan attacked Neal, at which point Moore ran out to aid Neal. This led to the pair forming a tag team known as Ink Inc., and on the May 3 episode of Impact! Moore and Neal defeated Douglas Williams and Brian Kendrick in their first match as a team. On May 16 at Sacrifice, Ink Inc. failed in their attempt to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from The Band (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall), when Neal's trainer Brother Ray interfered in the match and attacked Neal. The following month, on the June 17 episode of Impact!, Ink Inc. defeated The Band (Kevin Nash and Eric Young) to advance to the finals of a tournament for a shot at the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. In the finals the following week, Ink Inc. was defeated by Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode), when Brother Ray attacked Neal backstage prior to the match. At the July 26 and 27 tapings of Xplosion Ink Inc. entered a four team tournament to determine the new number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. After defeating Generation Me (Jeremy and Max Buck) in the semifinals, Ink Inc. was defeated in the finals by Desmond Wolfe and Magnus. At Bound for Glory, Ink Inc. defeated Eric Young and Orlando Jordan, winning their first match on pay-per- view. On the October 28 episode of Impact!, Ink Inc. received a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship against The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) in a three-way match, which also included Generation Me, but failed to win the championship. On December 5 at the Final Resolution pay-per-view, Ink Inc. lost to Beer Money, Inc. in a number one contender's match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the March 3 edition of Impact! Ink Inc. asked for and were granted a shot at Beer Money's TNA World Tag Team Championship at Victory Road. On March 13 at Victory Road, Ink Inc. failed in their attempt to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. After the match Moore turned heel by refusing to shake hands with the champions and instead spat beer in Storm's face. A similar show of disrespect was carried out by Moore on the March 24 edition of Impact!, after Ink Inc. had been defeated by Crimson and Scott Steiner. On April 17 at Lockdown, Ink Inc. defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus), Crimson and Scott Steiner and Eric Young and Orlando Jordan in a four tag team steel cage match to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The following month at Sacrifice, Ink Inc. was defeated by Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez) becoming faces once again. In the finish of the match, Neal suffered a neck injury, which would sideline him for the next four months. Ink Inc. returned on the September 22 edition of Impact Wrestling, attacking Mexican America, now the TNA World Tag Team Champions, at a tattoo parlour. On the October 13 edition of Impact Wrestling, Toxxin aligned herself with Ink Inc. by saving them from Mexican America. On October 16, during the Bound for Glory Preshow, Ink Inc. unsuccessfully challenged Mexican America for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On November 13 at Turning Point, Ink Inc. again failed to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship in a six-person tag team match, which also included Toxxin and Mexican America's Sarita. On November 17, Jesse Neal announced that he was parting ways with TNA after the following weekend's house shows. Despite the outburst, Neal appeared on the December 1 edition of Impact Wrestling, teaming with Moore in a three way TNA World Tag Team Championship number one contenders match, where they were defeated by the team of D'Angelo Dinero and Devon. Neal finished his dates with TNA on December 12 and afterwards left the promotion. Soon later, Toxxin also left the promotion.

The water flowing in from Araz enriches the lake with chlorides and has high mineralization. It is argued that throughout the ages, the rivers have flooded the area creating depressions and then refilled them with water. Before the 20th century, Aƒüg√∂l was already partially fed by drainage waters from irrigated fields. The volume of water in the lake had fluctuated in the past when it faced being dried out in single years and when it reached very high volumes of water in other years. When the Mingachevir dam was built in the mid 20th century, the water regime in the Mil steppe and Kura-Araz lowland changed. From 1960, the water to the lake inflowed only from saline water collectors built in the region to drain irrigation waters. In the present, the lake is fed by \\"K-2\\" and \\"K-3\\" collectors. Some areas around the lake have been used as pasture grounds. Other areas were transformed into irrigated agricultural lands used to grow cotton, wheat, lucerne, vegetables and wine.

In 1978, the area of the lake was declared zapovednik thus setting the highest level of protection category allowing only the scientific research. In 2001, the global importance of the lake was internationally recognized when the area was declared as Important Bird Area (IBA) when it was placed in the list of Ramsar wetlands of international importance. Therefore, in 2003, the protected area was enlarged by the presidential decree to the size . It is managed by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan Republic. The ministry supervises the activities in preservation of the flora and fauna in the protected area and guards it against illegal hunting and fishing.Azerbaijan Ecology Standards Monitoring Fund Retrieved on October 8, 2010 Climate The lake usually does not freeze with a few exceptions due to infrequent severe frost.

Early life Engelhardt was member of the wealthy and famous Engelhardt family. He graduated from the St. Petersburg School of Law in 1847, then served in the 1st and 5th departments of the Senate. In 1853 he left government service and devoted himself to studying astronomy. Astronomer In 1875, Engelhardt settled in Dresden and built himself an observatory with his own money, where he worked alone without assistants until 1897. His main work was researching comets, asteroids, nebulae, and star clusters. In 1870 he completed the observation of 50 comets and 70 asteroids. Turning to star clusters, in 1883 he completed a catalog of more than 400 nebulae. Beginning in 1886, he observed 829 stars in Bradley's directory to determine if they had companion stars. In the late 1890s, deteriorating health forced Engelhardt to give up personal observing, and he gave all his equipment to Kazan University, of which his friend and fellow astronomer Dmitri Dubyago was rector. The university built an observatory to house the equipment, which was opened in 1901 and named for Engelhardt from 1903 until 1931. Until the end of his life, Engelhardt took an active part in the construction and organization of the new observatory, and in his will gave Kazan University all his money and property, to be used for the development and maintenance of the observatory. Engelhardt was awarded an honorary doctorate by Kazan University in 1889, and in 1890 he was made a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Cultural activities For most of his life, Engelhardt took an active interest in Russian history, gathering materials and donating them to Russian collections. Engelhardt was a close friend of the composer Mikhail Glinka. When Glinka died in Berlin in 1857, Engelhardt arranged the transfer of his remains home to Tikhvin. Engelhardt also sent Glinka's collection of manuscripts to St. Petersburg, where the Glinka Public Library was founded, and published the scores of Glinka's operas and symphonic works. Later, at the request of the critic Vladimir Stasov (a law school classmate), Engelhardt published his memoirs of Glinka and the composer Alexander Dargomyzhsky. In the late 1890s, moving away from astronomical research, Engelhardt began a collection of material on Suvorov's campaign in Switzerland, which he donated to the Suvorov Museum in St. Petersburg in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 1812 war. Engelhardt's efforts made a significant contribution to perpetuating the memory of the Russian campaign in Switzerland. Engelhardt's correspondence with leading cultural figures (Glinka, Stasov, Franz Liszt, G. Bulow) is considered of historical value. Eponymy By decision of the XIV Congress of the International Astronomical Union, the Moon crater Engel'gardt was named in Engelhardt's honor.

The rats on amphetamine performed well on the repetitive > task but tended to miss the second stimulus; not so the rats on MK-202. > Given the similarity between the rat‚Äôs situation and the repetitive work > that most people must endure to make a living, a drug that increased lever > pressing without producing unresponsiveness would seem a likely > antidepressant‚Äîprovided we accept that inefficiency in unrewarding jobs > indicates psychiatric depression.\\" > \\"This implicit identification of impaired work efficiency with depressive > illness, inscribed in the use of amphetamine-boosted lever pressing as the > benchmark that subsequent antidepressants had to meet, applied to the > highest level executive type of work also.

Originally the prison had a capacity for 700 inmates in dormitory housing and 16 inmates in individual prison cells; the capacity increased as expansions opened.

Currently, it is still in use by the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland, but only for meetings and special occasions. Their day-to-day seat of water management is housed today on the Archimedesweg in Leiden. History Count William II of Holland Granting Privileges in 1255 to the local Dike-wardens of Spaarndam by Caesar van Everdingen, 1654, originally commissioned for the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg in Halfweg, and today in the collection of the Gemeenlandshuis Rijnland in Leiden. Heraldic shields of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland members in 1691, the year that this church window was donated by the Water Board to the church in Lisse, currently located in the St. Bavochurch. The first steps towards a formal method of dike management in Leiden were taken according to Ortelius in Brittenburg, making Leiden the oldest place in the Netherlands to conduct water management. The current building was built to house the Hoogheemraadschap that dates from the 12th century when the Oude Rijn river silted shut at Katwijk. In the centuries afterwards, a group of officials called heemraden oversaw the dikes along the IJ, the Zyl, the Does, and the dams at Zwammerdam and Spaarndam. Their privileges were described in a document that was given to the dike wardens at Spaarndam in 1255. This was the subject of a painting by Caesar van Everdingen that hangs in the Gemeenlandshuis Rijnland, the meeting hall purchased in 1578 on the Breestraat. This building was also the permanent residence of the dijkgraaf (official). The facade was renovated twenty years later in 1598 to keep up with the new town hall.Website of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland This Gemeenlandshuis is the first one designed for this purpose and financed by the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland. The organization later built a new Rijnlandshuis in 1641 at Spaarndam to stay at while inspecting the dam complex there, and another one to meet with the Amsterdam Water Board while inspecting the dikes along the Haarlemmertrekvaart and the sluices at Halfweg. The Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg was built by Pieter Post in 1645-1648. The building is nearly demolished today, but a town named after this building in the Haarlemmermeerpolder called Zwanenburg. The grandeur of all three buildings shows the relative wealth of the water board at the time. Besides building these houses, they also financed glass windows for churches and memorials to their members, such as the memorial to Nicolaas Kruik in the church in Spaarndam. Modifications to the building The facade was renovated twenty years after purchase in 1598 to keep up with the new Leiden town hall. In the years 1660-1670, the interior was redecorated according to a design by Pieter Post. In the early 19th century, it was painted brown, which caused damage to the brick and resulted in restoration activities in 1882.Gemeenlandshuis van Rijnland on the Rijksmonuments website for Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed In 1878 the architect Pierre Cuypers conducted another restoration of the building. Gemeenlandshuis today The building is considered one of Rijnland's most valuable buildings and is open to the public each year on Monument Day. It is also available for use for weddings, with its atmosphere similar to an old city hall.

Background  Wang Chao was born in 846, during the reign of Emperor Wuzong. His fifth-generation ancestor Wang Ye () served as the magistrate of Gushi County (Âõ∫Âßã, in modern Xinyang, Henan), and because the people loved him, he settled his family in Gushi. The family subsequently became known for their family business. Wang Chao himself served as a government worker at the Gushi County government.New Book of Tang, vol. 190. His father's name was Wang Nin (), and his mother was a Lady Dong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.Wang Chao's tombstone referred to Wang Nin's wife as a Lady Xu and indicated that she was the mother to Wang Chao and his brothers, whom they later took to Fujian. However, the tombstone also indicated that Lady Xu was buried in Gushi, which would be inconsistent with Wang Chao's having taken her to Fujian. The Zizhi Tongjian gave the name of Wang Chao's mother as Dong, thus making it appear to be the case that Lady Dong was Wang Chao's (and his brothers') mother and either the second wife or a concubine of Wang Nin's, but that formally Lady Xu, as Wang Nin's wife, would still be considered his mother legally. He had two younger brothers, Wang Shengui () and Wang Shenzhi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254.  Service under Wang Xu  In 881, with the Tang state overrun by agrarian rebellions, Wang Xu and his brother-in-law Liu Xingquan (), who were from Shou Prefecture (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), started a rebellion of their own and seized Shou, and then Guang (ÂÖâÂ∑û, in modern Xinyang), which Gushi County belonged to. Wang obtained a commission from the nearby warlord Qin Zongquan the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) as the prefect of Guang Prefecture. He forced the local men to serve in his army, and among the men he took into his army were Wang Chao and his brothers Wang Shengui and Wang Shenzhi. He made Wang Chao his discipline officer and favored Wang Chao. Later on, however, Qin turned against the Tang imperial government and was on the cusp of claiming imperial title himself. He ordered Wang Xu to pay taxes to him. When Wang Xu was unable to do so, he launched an army to attack Wang. Wang Xu, in fear, gathered 5,000 soldiers from Guang and Shou Prefectures and forced the people to cross the Yangtze River to the south. By spring 885, Wang had continued south and captured Ting (Ê±ÄÊ¥≤, in modern Longyan, Fujian) and Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures, but was not able to hold either for long.  Overthrow of Wang Xu and takeover of Quan Prefecture  By the time that Wang Xu reached Zhang Prefecture, his army was running low on food. As the terrain in Fujian Circuit (Á¶èÂª∫, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), which Zhang Prefecture belonged to, was rugged, he ordered that the old and the weak be abandoned. However, in violation of his order, Wang Chao and his brothers continued to take their mother Lady Dong with them. Wang Xu rebuked them and threatened to put Lady Dong to death. They begged for Lady Dong's life, offering to die in her stead. Other officers also spoke on their behalf, and Wang Xu relented. Meanwhile, by this point, Wang Xu had also become extremely paranoid, as he had been warned by a sorcerer that there was qi belonging to a king in his army, so he began to put to death anyone whom he considered to have talents surpassing his own ‚Äî going as far as putting Liu Xingquan to death. The fact that Wang was willing to put someone as close to him as Liu to death terrified the other officers. When the army reached Na'an (ÂçóÂÆâ, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), Wang Chao persuaded Wang Xu's forward commander, who feared that he would be Wang Xu's next target, into turning against Wang Xu. The forward commander and Wang Chao thus laid an ambush for Wang Xu and, when he was caught off-guard, arrested him. Wang Chao initially wanted to support the forward commander to be the new leader, but the forward commander pointed out that it was Wang Chao's idea that allowed them to survive Wang Xu's cruelty, and so the army agreed to have Wang Chao become their leader. Wang Chao initially wanted to take the army back north to their home in Guang Prefecture, but when they advanced to Sha (Ê≤ôÁ∏£, in modern Sanming, Fujian), the locals, who were suffering under the heavy burdens of the local prefect (Liao Yanruo () the prefect of Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou)), asked that Wang Chao save them from Liao. Wang Chao thus put Quan Prefecture under siege, capturing it in fall 886. He put Liao to death and Wang Xu under house arrest. (Wang Xu subsequently committed suicide.) As then-governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Fujian Circuit, Chen Yan, had a good reputation, Wang Chao decided not to go against Chen, and instead sent messengers to Fujian's capital Fu Prefecture () to submit to Chen. Chen commissioned Wang Chao as the prefect of Quan Prefecture. It was said that Wang Chao governed Quan with intelligence, gathering the scattered people, alleviating the tax burden, rebuilding the army, and drew support from the people and the army.  Takeover of the rest of Fujian Circuit  In 891, Chen Yan fell seriously ill. He sent messengers to summon Wang Chao to Fu Prefecture, intending to transfer the governorship to him. Before Wang could head to Fu Prefecture, however, Chen died. Chen's brother-in-law, the officer Fan Hui (), persuaded the soldiers to support him as acting governor and mobilized troops to resist Wang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Fan, however, grew extravagant and arrogant, losing the support of the soldiers. In 892, Wang Chao commissioned his cousin Wang Yanfu () as the commander and Wang Shenzhi as Wang Yanfu's deputy, to take an army to attack Fu Prefecture. It was said that the common Han people supported him by supplying food for the army, and the local non-Han supported him by supplying soldiers and ships.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. Wang Yanfu's and Wang Shenzhi's siege of Fu Prefecture, however, became bogged down due to the strong defenses that Fu Prefecture had, and Fan sought aid from Dong Chang the military governor of Weisheng Circuit (Â®ÅÂãù, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), who was also related by marriage to Chen. Dong sent an army south to aid Fan. Wang Yanfu and Wang Shenzhi, hearing that Dong's army was about to arrive, reported to Wang Chao and requested to withdraw. Wang Chao refused. When they requested that he come to the front to oversee the attack, he responded: Wang Yanfu and Wang Shenzhi, fearful of the rebuke, intensified their attacks. By summer 893, the food supply in Fu Prefecture ran out. Fan abandoned it and fled, and the Weisheng army, still on the way, hearing that Fan had fled, returned to Weisheng. Fan was killed by his soldiers in flight. Wang entered Fu Prefecture and claimed the title of acting governor. He buried Chen with great honors, and he gave a daughter in marriage to Chen's son Chen Yanhui (). Subsequently, two prefectures that had held out against Chen, Ting and Jian (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), also submitted to him. Some 20 groups of bandits also either submitted or were destroyed by him, pacifying the circuit. Then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong subsequently made Wang the governor in late 893. It was said that Wang encouraged farming, set fair tax rates, fostered friendly relations with the nearby circuits, and allowed the people to rest. In 896, Emperor Zhaozong made Fujian Circuit into Weiwu Circuit () and gave Wang the greater title of military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260.  Death and succession  While Wang Chao served as military governor, Wang Shenzhi served as deputy military governor. It was said that when Wang Shenzhi had faults, Wang Chao would batter him, but Wang Shenzhi would not show any resentment to the treatment. When Wang Chao grew seriously ill in 897, instead of trying to transfer the military governorship to one of his four sons (Wang Yanxing (), Wang Yanhong (), Wang Yanfeng (), Wang Yanxiu (), he entrusted the administration of the circuit to Wang Shenzhi. He died around new year 898. After his death, Wang Shenzhi offered the military governorship to Wang Shengui, who was then serving as the prefect of Quan Prefecture, because Wang Shengui was older, but Wang Shengui declined on the basis that Wang Shenzhi had greater accomplishments. Wang Shenzhi subsequently claimed the title of acting military governor, and Emperor Zhaozong confirmed him as military governor. Wang Shenzhi would eventually receive the title of Prince of Min from Zhu Wen (whose Later Liang succeeded Tang), and Wang Shenzhi's son Wang Yanjun would eventually claim the title of emperor of an independent state of Min, which would stand until 946.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 134.

It was directed by co-executive producer John Riggi and written by co- executive producer Jack Burditt. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on October 7, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include John Amos, Todd Buonopane, Reg E. Cathey, Queen Latifah and Rob Reiner. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) must appear before Congress to discuss NBC's merger with the fictional company network KableTown (a parody of Comcast). He hopes that he will charm celebrity members for the deal to go through, but one Congresswoman (Latifah) demands more diversity in the NBC programming lineup. As a result, Jack enlists Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to come up with some new development ideas. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), the head writer of the fictional sketch show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) is fed up with the criticism her writing staff gives her, and finally Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) helps Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) reapply in the competitive NBC page program. This episode of 30 Rock was generally, though not universally, well received among television critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 4.90 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.1 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot NBC executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) attends a Congressional hearing in Washington D.C. regarding the Kabletown-NBC merger deal. He is able to consolidate support for the deal, until Representative Regina Bookman (Queen Latifah) calls out NBC for being racist and demands that there be more diversity in the programming lineup. Following the hearing, Jack goes back to New York and asks Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and \\"Dot Com\\" Slattery (Kevin Brown) to produce a program for the African-American community. Dot Com suggests a show called Let's Stay Together, about an African-American family in the 1970s, but when Grizz Griswold (Grizz Chapman) suggests that a talking dog be added to the show, Tracy orders Dot Com to incorporate it into the rewrite, much to Dot Com's dismay. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), the head writer of the sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan, is unhappy about the lack of respect she gets from her writing staff and complains to Jack, her boss, about the situation. Jack asks her if staff writer James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) can be promoted to co-head writer in an effort to diversify NBC. Liz accepts, seeing this as an opportunity for someone else to get the lack of respect and complaints she does. She gets upset, though, when Toofer gets a television interview as head writer, and insists that she herself should also be there as she is co-head writer. The two appear on Rutherford Rice's (Reg E. Cathey) talk show Right On, a show aimed toward African-American audiences. Liz gets visibly upset when Rice gives Toofer all of the credit she deserves, and as a result of her behavior she is escorted off the set by a security guard. At the same time, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), a former NBC page, is back at NBC and wants to reapply to the page program, but notes that it has become a pageant. When Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) hears of this, she volunteers to help him win the pageant using her own pageant experience. Jenna treats Kenneth as her mother Verna (Jan Hooks) treated her during her pageant years. After a failed, over-the-top performance in front of Human resources mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane), Jenna vows to get Kenneth his job back. She goes to Jack to ask him for his help, and Jack orders Jeffrey to hire Kenneth back. When Representative Bookman makes an unexpected visit to New York, Jack tries to show NBC's commitment to diversity, but is thwarted when Bookman sees signs next to two bathrooms that read \\"Colored\\" and \\"White\\" that were really intended for the paper recycling bins that had been removed only moments ago, and Jeffrey informing Jack and Bookman that the minority slot in the page program was filled by Kenneth. Jack tries to improve the situation by giving \\"head writer\\" Toofer a medal for his work, but Bookman sees right through this, and discovers that Liz is the only one that truly deserves her respect, and congratulates her. After more grandstanding, Bookman tells Jack she will vote no on the Kabletown-NBC deal unless he gives her reason not to. The episode ends with a taping of the Let's Stay Together rewrite, including the talking dog. Production Rob Reiner guest starred as himself in \\"Let's Stay Together\\" \\"Let's Stay Together\\" was written by co-executive producer Jack Burditt and directed by co-executive producer and staff writer John Riggi. This was Burditt's thirteenth writing credit after \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\", \\"The Baby Show\\", \\"The Fighting Irish\\", \\"Cleveland\\", \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"Subway Hero\\", \\"Sandwich Day\\", \\"The One with the Cast of Night Court\\", \\"St. Valentine's Day\\", \\"The Ones\\", \\"Kidney Now!\\", and \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\". This was Riggi's fourth helmed episode, having directed \\"Goodbye, My Friend\\", \\"The Problem Solvers\\" and \\"The Moms\\". This episode of 30 Rock originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 7, 2010, as the third episode of the show's fifth season and the 83rd overall episode of the series. In September 2010, it was announced that actress and singer Queen Latifah would guest star on the show as a Congresswoman named Regina Bookman who demands from Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy, more diversity in its NBC programming lineup. Latifah is a fan of the show and big fan of Baldwin and series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. She said in an interview she was \\"out of my mind\\" excited to guest-star. Latifah is due to appear in a future episode of 30 Rock. It was also confirmed that actor- director Rob Reiner would appear as himself, and in \\"Let's Stay Together\\" he played a Congressman. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported in August 2010 that the show set a casting call \\"for an African-American male in the 30s-60s age range\\" to play a fictitious host named Rutherford Rice, a well-spoken host of Right On, a fictitious talk show focusing on African American issues. In this episode, Rutherford Rice was played by actor Reg E. Cathey, best known for his role on the HBO drama The Wire as Norman Wilson. Actor John Amos made a brief appearance in the episode in which he stars in one scene from the Let's Stay Together show alongside a talking dog named Stanley the Dog. This was actor Todd Buonopane's fourth appearance as the character Jeffrey Weinerslav, an NBC Human resource mediator. Buonopane previously appeared in the season three episodes \\"Believe in the Stars\\", \\"Cutbacks\\", and \\"Jackie Jormp-Jomp\\". In an August 2010 interview, co- showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock was asked if the series would continue to make reference of the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by cable company Comcast‚Äîwhich occurred in November 2009‚Äîto which Carlock replied that their version of the acquisition was in the \\"works\\". Carlock noted that the NBC-Comcast deal would not change the show's \\"reason for existence\\", explaining that since the merger has occurred it has made things \\"even funnier\\" for the staff writers. \\"To us it's great, we've been able to do our version of 'ripped from the headlines,' which a lot of comedies don't get to do.\\" In the episode, Representative Bookman called out NBC for being racist in regards to its programming lacking diversity. This subplot was based on real- life in which Jeff Zucker, then-President and CEO of NBC Universal, who attended the House Judiciary Committee hearing in February 2010 in discussions of the NBC-Comcast deal, was asked by United States Representative Maxine Waters why the NBC network had not attempted to create shows that would appeal to the black community. Cultural references Donald Glover (pictured), a former 30 Rock writer, is referenced in the episode In the beginning of the episode, Liz tells Jack that her writing staff have been replacing her name- plate title with various names including \\"F. Krueger.\\" She explains that the name refers to a time in which she got a chemical peel, wore a red and green sweater with a fedora. This is a reference to the fictional horror villain from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series Freddy Krueger's appearance. During the hearing in Washington D.C., Representative Rob Reiner says \\"The acclaimed director of When Harry Met Sally... would never do that!\\", a reference to Reiner who directed the 1989 romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally.... One of the applicants to become an NBC page plays a keyboard and sings in the tune of musician Billy Joel's 1989 song \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\". After returning from the hearing in Washington, in which Representative Bookman accused NBC of being racist, Jack tells Liz that during the hearing he did not pay attention to Bookman's heartfelt speech as he was too busy trying to remember the name \\"of the black kid on Community\\", a reference to actor Donald Glover who stars in Community‚Äîanother NBC program‚Äîand who Jack is referring to. In addition, Glover was a former writer on 30 Rock. Coincidentally, guest star Queen Latifah executive produces the romantic comedy television series Let's Stay Together that airs on BET. 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip‚Äîboth of which debuted on 2006‚Äì07 NBC lineup‚Äîrevolved around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. The first season episode \\"Jack the Writer\\" contained a self-referencing walk and talk sequence, which was commonly used on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Sorkin's previous series The West Wing. In this episode, the walk and talk sequence is seen here in which Jack, before departing to Washington, has a discussion with Liz. Show-within-a-show Let's Stay Together was conceived by Dot Com with a setting and characters similar to influential African American sitcom Good Times. John Amos, who played the father on Good Times, makes a cameo appearance as the lead in the scene being filmed for the new show. He has cheesy lines and co-stars with a talking dog, a corruption of the show's original concept reminiscent of comments Amos and others have made regarding wasted potential in Good Times. Reception Queen Latifah's appearance was well received by critics In its original American broadcast, \\"Let's Stay Together\\" was watched by 4.90 million households, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It received a 2.1 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, that is 2.1 percent of all people in that group, and 7 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"When It Rains, It Pours\\", which was watched by 5.688 million American viewers. Andy Greenwald of New York magazine called \\"Let's Stay Together\\" a \\"pretty great episode for a show that ... seems to have gotten its groove back.\\" Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix who enjoyed the previous week's episode as he believed the show was back in peak, noted that the show \\"was back to more uneven, but still funny, territory\\" with this episode. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode \\"worked just fine\\", and enjoyed Liz's disastrous appearance on Right On. He, however, did not like Jenna and Kenneth's pageant story. A contributor from The Huffington Post said the episode had a \\"ton of hilarious moments\\", and that Queen Latifah \\"was the highlight of the show\\". Vanity Fairs Juli Weiner enjoyed Maulik Pancholy's appearance as Jack's assistant Jonathan, writing that Jonathan is \\"perhaps the most underutilized character on the show, and we were happy to see him get some screen time this episode.\\" Further in her recap, Weiner said \\"Thank you, Jenna and Jack, for mercifully putting an end to the tension-less Kenneth's-rehiring narrative.\\" Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times deemed it a \\"wildly clever and satiric episode\\" that also \\"delivered an important critique about the limitations of diversity programs.\\" Blake said that Jane Krakowski's Jenna was on fire in \\"Let's Stay Together\\". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the show has always dealt with racism issues \\"pretty well\\" and that the issue featured here \\"was no exception.\\" Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported that \\"Let's Stay Together\\" was one of his favorite episodes of the season, and that it was a \\"massively pleasing episode.\\" Caitlan Smith of The Atlantic wrote that Latifah \\"stole the show\\" and \\"drove the action\\" as her character Regina Bookman in this episode of 30 Rock. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin called this episode \\"clumsy and tired\\", explaining it was \\"misfiring on all cylinders. The satire was toothless, the playing strained and the whole enterprise reeked of mild desperation.\\" He continued in his recap that \\"Let's Stay Together\\" had a \\"golden opportunity to comment insightfully and hilariously about the tricky intersection of politics, power, race and privilege\\", however \\"it recycled jokes that were unfunny and overly familiar the first time around\\". In conclusion, Rabin gave it a C grade rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student opined that the show's writing \\"is still sharp ‚Äì not 'as sharp as ever,' but sharp ‚Äì but a lot of the most interesting plots have already played out, and a lot of the new plots aren't interesting.\\" Sanders said that the stories featured here had \\"a few big laughs ... but they're assembled so haphazardly and put into such a bulky framework that the train just never gets enough steam to salvage the episode.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:30 Rock (season 5) episodes Category:2010 American television episodes ","title":"Let's Stay Together (30 Rock)"},{"id":"29111842","text":"Dhananjay Singh is a Political Figure in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh.

Roe, United States Army Nurse Corps, for gallantry in action on 10 February 1944, near Anzio, Italy. During a concentrated shelling of the 33d Field Hospital by heavy caliber enemy artillery the entire hospital area was sprayed with shell fragments which killed two nurses and wounded other military personnel. Electric wires were cut and lights extinguished. Working with flashlights, Lieutenant Elaine Roe and Lieutenant Rita Rourke immediately began the orderly evacuation of forty-two patients while quieting others who had become alarmed and were attempting to leave their beds. Throughout the shelling, which included enemy air bursts, they exhibited remarkable coolness and courage and carried on with complete disregard for their own safety. The quick thinking, competence under unnerving conditions and the loyal consideration of Lieutenant Roe and Lieutenant Rourke for the welfare of their patients, prevented confusion which might have been critical, and were an inspiration to the enlisted men working under their supervision.

It is commonly called Table Mountain aloe, and is a rare succulent plant that is endemic to the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. It naturally occurs only on the Table Mountain range, within the city of Cape Town. Description Aloiampelos commixta is a rambling, multi-stemmed plant, also known as the Peninsula rambling aloe. This \\"accent plant\\" rarely gets over tall, as its slender stems tend to sprawl along the ground and over rocks. Aloiampelos commixta flowers in late winter (August and September). A stout inflorescence shoots up, bearing reddish erect buds that open into dense, bright orange- yellow flowers. In its natural habitat in the fynbos vegetation of Table Mountain, its flowers are pollinated by sunbirds and honey bees. The leaves are thick, fleshy and evenly-spaced on a fine stem, with distinctive green stripes on the internodes. The leaves tend to be about 200 mm long, with tiny white teeth along the margins. A. commixta is easily identified by its straight, wide, succulent leaves (that do not recurve downwards, as in the case of many other Aloiampelos species), by its slender, sprawling stems, and by the unique and distinguishing subcapitate raceme of its flowers. In particular, its flowers are much larger than those of other species in the genus, and are bunched together more densely at the top of the raceme.Goldblatt, P. and Manning, J.C. 2000. Cape Plants: A conspectus of the Cape Flora of South Africa. Strelitzia 9. National Botanical Institute, Cape Town Distribution In its natural habitat Cape Town's very own unique aloe relative, this species is indigenous (and endemic) to the Cape Peninsula. Within this tiny natural range, Aloiampelos commixta is particularly concentrated in the central region of the Peninsula, in the area around Kommetjie, Kalk Bay, Fishhoek, Simonstown and Miller's Point (although smaller, outlying populations exist elsewhere on the Table Mountain chain). This elegant little plant is also one of only three aloes and their relatives that are indigenous to the city of Cape Town (the others being the fynbos aloe and the soap aloe). Within its natural habitat it is very hardy, and survives both frost and fire.Aloiampelos commixta is a resprouter, similar to its relatives A. gracilis and A.juddii. The ability to re-sprout after being burnt to the ground is an adaptation to its fire-prone Fynbos habitat. Other species in the genus include the large and robust Aloiampelos striatula of the Eastern Cape mountains and Aloiampelos juddii, a rare little species which is confined to a few rocky outcrops on a farm near Cape Agulhas.Reynolds, G.W. 1950. The aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town. Threats and conservation In Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos This threatened species is restricted to very small area, surrounded by suburbs in the middle of a city of 3.5 million people. However most of the known plants are located within Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) and their high, inaccessible habitat is usually too steep and rocky to be used for agriculture or development. The major threat to this species comes from invasive alien plants ‚Äì chief among these ‚ÄúRooikrans‚Äù (Acacia cyclops) from Australia which, until recently, blanketed the slopes of the Cape Peninsula. South African National Parks has now brought this infestation under control and the area is slowly returning to its natural vegetation. However the weed clearance will require several follow ups to be completed, otherwise the highly invasive acacias will rapidly return and cover these slopes again, driving Aloiampelos commixta (as well as other endemics) to extinction.Helme, N.A. & Raimondo, D. 2009. Aloe commixta A.Berger. National Assessment: Red List of South African Plants version 2011.1 A more minor threat comes from the increasing human traffic across the peninsula. The plants lie low to the ground, and even light human trampling kills them. They are also in danger from illegal gathering by plant collectors. This plant is listed as Vulnerable (VU) on IUCN's global Red Data List, which reports that there are currently only a few hundred plants in existence. Cultivation A specimen in cultivation in a Cape Town fynbos garden The colour of the flowers can range between reddish-orange and bright yellow. This plant thrives in the winter-rainfall climate of the Cape, to which it is perfectly adapted. It is thus difficult to cultivate outside of mediterranean-type climates, and it does not do well in tropical or summer-rainfall areas. It can survive in most soil types ‚Äì other than coastal beach sand dunes. In its natural habitat however, it normally grows in slightly acidic sand. Unlike most members of the tribe Aloeae, it tolerates some light semi-shade as well. Adapted as it is to the Cape Town climate, it naturally grows very well in Cape Town gardens, and it looks attractive sprawling over stonewall terraces, or rambling over rocky slopes and boulders. It produces striking, bright orange or yellow flowers in the winter. This makes it a useful ornamental plant for adding colour to the garden at a time of the year when most other plants are not in flower. When the sprawling stems become too long and untidy, it is best to prune the plant right back (this simulates the effects of a veldfire in its natural habitat). The plant will re-grow denser & bushier than before, and the cuttings from this valuable plant can then be re-planted (or given to plant collectors). Cuttings (truncheons) are also the easiest way to propagate Aloiampelos commixta. Allow the cuttings to dry for a few days, and then simply insert them into sandy soil. This species has both male and female flowers on each plant, but an individual plant is not self-fertile. The seeds germinate in semi-shade, in cool (25‚Äì35 ¬∞C), well-drained, slightly-acidic sand. Traditional uses This plant was known and used medicinally by the Khoi, the oldest known inhabitants of the Cape. Later, it was one of the first plants to be cultivated by the Dutch East India Company in its \\"Company's Gardens\\". The active ingredients that are supposedly responsible for the plant's medicinal qualities are the compounds known as aloin (from the sap) as well as complex polysaccharides and glycoproteins (from the pulp).Smith, G.F. & Van Wyk, B.-E. 2008.

Biography Lydia Lipkowska, from Music News, 1921 Lipkowska in drawings by Marguerite Martyn, with a photo, 1910 Lydia was born in Babyn, where is a village museum dedicated to her, in the family of a rural teacher. Lydia had three sisters, four brothers. Her aunt was Maria Zankovetska, a famous Ukrainian actress. She received education in the Mariinsky Women's Gymnasium in Kamyanets-Podilskyi. Together with other students, she sang in the church choir, she had her own solo parties, drawing attention with a magic voice that ran under the dome of the cathedral. Residents of Kamyanets called the girl \\"Singing Bird\\". After Kamyanets- Podiskyi Lipkowska was trained at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. She is said to have studied with Natalia Iretskaya, a pupil of the well-known Pauline Viardot. She was committed to the Mariinsky Theatre from 1906‚Äî1908 and again from 1911‚Äì1913. She was a member of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1909 until 1911. Lipkowska's debut with the Metropolitan was as Violetta in La Traviata on November 18, 1909, with Caruso as Alfredo. She sang as a guest artist at the Boston Opera Company in 1909 and the Chicago Grand Opera Company in 1910. While in Boston, Lipkowska was honored by The Lenox Hotel, which put on its menu the \\"cup Lydia\\" and the \\"Souffle a la Lipkowska\\". She petioned a judge for an injunction against the hotel, claiming that the menu items were \\"injuring her reputation and holding her up to ridicule.\\" In 1911 she made her debut at the Royal Opera House in London as Mim√¨ in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me. In 1912, Lipkowska charged New York gangster Sam Schepps with usury over his refusal to return two diamonds worth $80,000 that she'd pawned to him. Lipkowska said that she'd borrowed $12,000 from Schepps, had left the diamonds with him as security, and that he sought $5000 in interest before he would return the jewels. In 1914 she sang in the world premiere of Amilcare Ponchielli's I Mori di Valenza at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. Lipkowska escaped from the Soviet Union with her then husband Pierre Bodin in 1920, arriving in New York on the Adriatic of the White Star Line on February 8. In September 1920, Lipkowska sang Gilda in Rigoletto with the San Carlo Opera Company in Manhattan. After retiring from the stage she lived in Romania where she was active as a voice teacher. One of her students was the soprano Virginia Zeani. She died in Beirut at the age of 75. For part of her life she was married to baritone Georges Baklanoff.

He is best known for his qualitative analysis of specialization stratification in the underground economies related to computer crime. Academic publication and mainstream news coverage While at UCLA, Abad discovered a method by which collisions in the hash function used in Internet Protocol datagrams may be leveraged to enable covert channel communications. His discovery was a centerpiece of covert communications methodology and was the primary citation for an Association for Computing Machinery paper on covert channel detection and another on a similar technique using TCP timestamps, the two most well-cited and widely republished papers on the subject. In 2005 while working at Cloudmark, Abad spent six months examining the phishing underworld from the inside. Abad discovered that phishers were using IRC channels in order to trade personal information. He stalked and collected messages from thirteen chat rooms phishers use. Whereas past phishing researchers believed that phishing was coordinated by highly organized criminals, Abad discovered that phishing rings were decentralized.

One of the most popular and prolific poets of his time, he composed a large number of poems in a variety of metres. Morus's work bridges the gap between the strict-metre tradition of the Beirdd y Uchelwyr (the medieval \\"Poets of the Nobility\\") and popular verse. Life Huw Morus was born in 1622, most likely in Llangollen, and was the son of Forys ap Sion ap Ednyfed. Around 1647 his father moved the family to the farm of Pont-y-meibion in the parish of Llansilin near Glyn Ceiriog. Little is known about the poet's early years, but he may have been educated at the Ruthin Grammar School or at the Free School in Oswestry over the Shropshire border. However, in a poem Ar ofyn gostegion yn amser Cromwel, Morus complains of a seven years' apprenticeship, and there is an otherwise undocumented tradition that he had trained as a tanner.Huw Morus, National Library of Wales He appears to have been unmarried and to have lived at the family farm for the remainder or his life. Grave of Huw Morus, Llansilin churchyard Huw was sponsored by several members of the gentry of north-east Wales, including William Owen of Brogyntyn, Sir Thomas Mostyn of Gloddaeth, and Sir Thomas Myddleton of Chirk Castle. He composed several notable elegies, including one (in dialogue form) for Barbara Myddleton, the wife of Richard Myddleton of Plas Newydd, Llansilin, which is regarded as one of the finest in Welsh literature. Morus was a staunch churchman and Royalist, many of his poems attacking Oliver Cromwell, the Roundheads, and the Commonwealth of England, although he escaped serious repercussions by giving his characters the names of various animals. He opposed the Welsh Puritanism of Morgan Llwyd, Vavasor Powell and Walter Cradock, and satirised them mercilessly in verse. He also composed a number of moral and devotional poems, as well as Christmas and \\"May\\" carols. He was given the name Eos Ceiriog for his love and nature poems, and pioneered a style based on established free-accented metres but containing perfect examples of cynghanedd. This developed a school of followers in the 18th century, though few of his imitators were able to approach his level of skill. Morus' poems are strongly rooted in the society of the time, and enable us to gain a glimpse into the lives of ordinary rural people in Wales in the second half of the 17th century. Morus was buried on 31 August 1709, in Llansilin parish church; above his grave is a stained-glass window containing some of his englynion cyffes (confessional verses).

Pablo Picasso spent a year in this town and learned a considerable amount of his artistic skills in the town. History Because of its location on a small hill with a natural spring near the top, Horta has been inhabited for centuries. It was a great advantage during medieval sieges, to not be forced to get water from the rivers outside of town. The earliest inhabitants were Iberians, who lived in the area until the arrival of the Romans. In the 8th century Horta, like most of Spain, was under Muslim rule, then reconquered by Christians in the 12th Century. There are still olive trees, like the 1,000-year-old Parot, that were planted by the Muslims during their 400-year rule. Horta de Sant Joan is the birthplace of Manuel Pallares, friend and companion of Pablo Picasso. Picasso spent some time in Horta during his youth (1897‚Äì98) with his friend Manuel. He is quoted as having said, \\"Everything I know I learned in Horta\\". Picasso later returned to develop his Proto-Cubism style of painting (1909). During both visits he made many paintings and drawings. There is a Centro Picasso (Picasso Center) that organizes expositions, symposiums, and publications about the artist. There is also an Eco-Museum of the Natural Park of the Ports, and a visitor's center with maps and hotel information. Geography Horta de Sant Joan, sometimes called Orta, is located on a hill with a view of the landscape of the northwestern foothills of the mountain range called the Ports of Beceite. The Saint Salvador d'Horta monastery, also known as Convent of Angels, is located at the foot of the Santa Barbara Mountain. The rock formations called Benet's Rocks are located within Horta de Sant Joan's municipal area. Benet's Rocks form the most characteristic overall landscape in the northern section of the mountain range. Of the three large rock forms, the left-most one is referred to as the Dog's Head because when viewed from the side it strongly resembles that form. Much of Horta de Sant Joan is within the Natural Park of the Ports of Beseite. The area outside the park boundaries is mostly agricultural, with large tracts of olive, almond, and fruit trees, as well as vineyards. There are three major rivers crossing the area around Horta. The river Algars to the west forms the boundary between Catalonia (comarca of Terra Alta) and Aragon (comarca of Matarra√±a). The second river, Estrets, is to the west and is a tributary of the river Algars. The river Canaletes, to the north, later joins the largest river in Spain, the Ebro. Climate Horta de Sant Joan has an Interior Mediterranean climate, with very cold winters and extremely hot summers. The area benefits from the Ports Mountain range, which traps cooler sea air from the coast and brings a natural form of \\"air conditioning\\" in the evenings in the summer called the Garbi for the winds from the east by that name. Economy With the natural park surrounding it, Horta's economy is mainly based around agriculture, with tourism also being a factor in the economy.

It was first described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1847. Description The wingspan is . Adults are on wing from April to June and again from July to September in two generations in western Europe. The moth is easily disturbed during the day, especially in hot weather, flies from dusk and occasionally comes to light. The scarce light plume (Crombrugghia laetus) is similar and examination of the genitalia is necessary if it is suspected to be this species. The larvae feed on smooth hawksbeard (Crepis capillaris), narrow-leaved hawk's-beard (Crepis tectorum), Crepis succifolia, Crepis conyzaefolia, mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), hawkweed oxtongue (Picris hieracioides), blue heliotrope (Heliotropium amplexicaule), perennial sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis), prickly sow-thistle (Sonchus asper), Chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Cichorium albida. Larvae of the spring generation feed on the central parts of the plant, while the larvae of the summer generation feed on the flower buds. Full-grown larvae are long and orange, bright red or pinkish brown. Distribution It is found in almost all of Europe, as well as Asia Minor, North Africa and the Canary Islands. It is also known from Afghanistan, India and Iran.

He contributed in the field of group theory, most notably with the concept of the Ree group in . Early life Ree received his early education in Hamhung, South Hamgyong, in what is now North Korea; he attended the Hamhung #1 Public Ordinary School (Ìï®Ìù• Ï†ú 1Í≥µÎ¶ΩÎ≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê), and in 1934 entered the Hamhung Public High School (Ìï®Ìù•Í≥µÎ¶ΩÍ≥†Îì±Î≥¥ÌÜµÌïôÍµê). He went onto Keij≈ç Imperial University, where he studied physics, which was an unusual choice for Koreans at the time. Ree graduated in 1944 with a physics degree; he then went to Fengtian, Manchukuo (today Shenyang, Liaoning in the People's Republic of China) to work for an aircraft company. Career After the surrender of Japan in 1945 and the end of Japanese rule in Korea, Ree returned to his home country and in 1947 took up a teaching position in the mathematics department at Seoul National University as an assistant professor. Later that year, in Namdaemun Market, Ree found an issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, which proposedly was left by an American soldier. On the Bulletin was the paper 'Note on power series', in which Max Zorn solved a problem about the convergence of certain power series with complex coefficients. In the paper, Zorn posed a question of whether the same result held for power series with real coefficients. Ree solved the problem and sent the solution to Max Zorn. When Zorn received Ree's solution, it was sent to the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society to be published in 1949 with the title 'On a problem of Max Zorn' and become the first mathematical paper published by a Korean in an international journal. During the Korean War, he fled south to Busan, and in 1953 he was awarded a Canadian Scholarship to allow him to study for a Ph.D. degree at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. He completed his dissertation under the title Witt Algebras in 1955. His thesis advisor was Stephen Arthur Jennings. Following the award of his doctorate, Ree was appointed as a lecturer at Montana state university, despite facing several problems regarding his labour permission and nationality. In the summer of 1955 Ree received a grant from the National Research Council of Canada and he worked with Jennings on Lie algebras. His two most renowned papers were written from 1960 to 1961, in which he suggested a Lie type group over a finite field now named after him. In 1962 after being promoted to an assistant professor in mathematics at University of British Columbia, he was granted an academic year which he spent in Yale. He was elected a member of Royal society of Canada in 1964. Personal life=Statelessness When Ree went to extend his visa at the Consulate, his passport was confiscated and he was declared stateless. Eventually, with considerable difficulty, his passport problems were sorted out and he continued to work at the University of British Columbia. Although, his entrance to South Korea was banned until 1996, when the ban was cancelled celebrating quintessential of the foundation of Korean Mathematical Society. According to his colleagues, Rimhak Ree identified his nationality as ‚ÄúJoseon‚Äù, which is a former name of Korea as well as a current autonym of North Korea.

Laois.Breen, \\"Manch√°n, Manchianus, Manch√≠ne\\" Manch√°n twice makes his appearance in Latin sources as a scholar whose authority still mattered after his death. First, he is probably the Manchianus, called pater and sapiens, who is named by an anonymous Irishman in his preface to the De mirabilibus sacrae scripturae ('On the miraculous things in sacred scripture'), written in 655 and so shortly after Manch√°n's death.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, Early medieval Ireland, pp. 187‚Äì8. The author, who uses the nom de plume Augustine and is for this reason known today as the Irish Pseudo- Augustine, appears to have been a pupil of Manch√°n as well as of one Eusebius. Second, Manch√°n may be the 'M., doctor noster' who is cited in a Hiberno-Latin commentary on the Catholic Epistles for his exegetical views on the Epistle of James. This anonymous work is uniquely preserved in a manuscript now held at Karlsruhe (Germany), but once in the possession of Reichenau Abbey. The glosses also cite a number of 7th-century Irish scholars, including Laidcenn mac Buith Bannaig, Breccanus, Banb√°n and Bercanus mac √Åed, who are known to have been associated with Cumm√©ne Fota (Cummianus). He is probably the Manchan referenced as \\"Patronus de Coolcasheen, S.

Pocketbooks is an indiepop band formed in London in 2006. Their music combines melodic boy/girl harmonies, spiralling guitars and delicate piano lines with a dash of 60s soul. The band first introduced themselves to the world by appearing on the 2006 compilation The Kids At The Club, released on How Does It Feel To Be Loved?, alongside indiepop favourites such as Suburban Kids With Biblical Names, Tender Trap, I‚Äôm From Barcelona and Voxtrot. As well as playing gigs across the UK, Europe and the USA, they headlined the first ever Indietracks event on a steam railway in April 2007 which later turned into the annual Indietracks Festival which several members of the band now help to organise. They have played shows with The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, Camera Obscura, God Help The Girl, Art Brut, The Wedding Present, and Darren Hayman, as well as festivals such as Offset Festival, New York Popfest, San Francisco Popfest, London Popfest, Indiepop Days in Germany and Rip It Up! in Sweden. In 2009 they played a Rough Trade in-store event to celebrate their inclusion on the Rough Trade Indiepop 09 compilation alongside 2009 favourites Vivian Girls, Los Campesinos! and Dum Dum Girls. Their debut single Cross The Line, released on Atomic Beat Records in 2007, was described by poet and novelist Simon Armitage as ‚Äúpure snowshaker pop, and more dressing table than kitchen sink‚Äù. This was followed by an EP, Waking Up, released on Make Do And Mend Records in 2008. Their debut album, Flight Paths, was released on 13 July 2009 on How Does It Feel To Be Loved?. This was preceded by a single, \\"Footsteps\\", on 15 June 2009. Songs from the album picked up radio play from Huw Stephens (BBC Radio 1), Gideon Coe (BBC 6 Music) and John Kennedy (Xfm). In 2009, music critic Everett True said of the album ‚ÄúI know what I like, and I like this.‚Äù The band's second album Carousel was released in September 2011 on Odd Box Records.  History  The band was formed in 2006 by Andy Hudson, who had previously been writing and recording as a solo artist under the Pocketbooks name. The original line-up included Andy Hudson on vocals and piano, Benjamin Dorning on guitar, Mark Reston on bass guitar, Emma Hall on keyboard and backing vocals, and Daniel Chapman on drums. Benjamin played his final gig with the band in April 2007, after which the remaining members went through a role change, moving Mark onto guitar and Daniel onto bass guitar. Jonny Tansey then joined on drums in July 2007. Emma began to play a larger role on vocals as Andy‚Äôs song writing leaned more towards the boy/girl harmonies the band have become known for. Mark played his final gig with the band in September 2007 and was replaced by Ian Cowen on guitar, who played his first gig the following month. This completed the line- up. In 2012, after playing their largest gig to date at Auditorio Municipal Parque Fof√≥ in Murcia, Spain, Pocketbooks decided to take an extended break to concentrate on their other musical projects. Emma Hall now sings in The Fireworks. Daniel Chapman currently plays bass guitar in Cosines, writes and records solo material as Hot Booth and previously played in The Loves and One Fathom Down. Ian Cowen also plays bass guitar in The Sunny Street, Electroph√∂nvintage, The Understudies, and previously The Cut-Outs. Jonny Tansey previously played drums in The Loves, Electroph√∂nvintage and One Fathom Down. Andy, Emma and Ian are all involved in the running of the Indietracks Festival.

Tough and hardy, with bright yellow flowers, it is a popular plant in gardens around the world. Description Aloiampelos striatula is a robust rambling plant that can form a large shrub of up to 2 m in height. It is closely related to Cape Town's Aloiampelos commixta, but it is easily distinguished from it by the distinctive dark green stripes on the stems and leaf sheaths (its species name, striatula, means \\"little stripes\\"), and by its thin, recurved leaves (which, like its flowers, are more densely packed). The leaves of striatula are dark green and strongly recurved, with numerous small white teeth along their margins. The flowers are reddish-orange and appear densely on tall (400mm), un-branched, cone-shaped racemes throughout the summer. The unique Caesia variety of this species - found only around Molteno in the Eastern Cape - has lighter grey-green leaves and bright yellow flowers.Smith, G.F. & Van Wyk, B.-E. 2008.

It is very tough and hardy however and has been planted widely in gardens - in South Africa and around the world. Although closest to the rare and unique Aloiampelos commixta of Table Mountain, Aloiampelos striatula is part of a genus, Aloiampelos, that grows throughout Southern Africa. Other species in this group are: Aloiampelos ciliaris, Aloiampelos tenuior, Aloiampelos gracilis, Aloiampelos juddii, Aloiampelos decumbens, and of course A. commixta and A. striatula itself.Reynolds, G.W. 1950. The aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town. Cultivation One of the hardiest of aloes and relatives, it will tolerate a wide range of conditions, and is even known commonly as the \\"hardy aloe\\". It will tolerate much colder temperatures than most aloes and relatives, including frost and even some light snow, but it prefers full sun and well-drained soil. In the Eastern Cape it is often planted along the boundaries of kraals, as it naturally forms a well-shaped and hardy hedge. Like other climbing aloes, it can easily be propagated by cuttings(truncheons) as well as by seed. The plant's Latin species epithet \\"striatula\\" means \\"little stripes\\", and refers to the thin dark-green stripes that can be seen on the plant's leaf sheaths. Due to their similar species names, striatula is often confused in literature with the similarly named Aloe striata (\\"coral aloe\\").http://www.succulents.co.za/aloes/rambling- aloes/index.php This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

Sequence  When the Counts of Celje died out in 1456, the Bavarian Counts of Ortenburg- Neuortenburg, a branch of the noble family of Spanheimer, made a false claim to the County of Ortenburg in Carinthia. The Bavarian counts assumed that their family founded the Carinthian lineage, and that the regents of the Carinthian county had come from Bavaria and the regents of the Bavarian county from Carinthia. In fact, neither an agnatic (patrilineal) nor a marital connection between the two houses has been established. To strengthen his claim to the Carinthian county, Bavarian Count Johann II, son of Sebastian I, followed the call to arms of the King of the Romans Maximilian I against Switzerland. In return, Maximilian had supposedly promised to enfeoff Johann with the Carinthian County and to marry him to the rich heiress of the last Lords of Wallsee. Johann, however, fell at the Battle of Dornach, and ownership of the Carinthian County remained elsewhere. In 1530 the Bavarian Ortenburg Count Christoph I took part in the Reichstag in Augsburg, where to his astonishment he encountered a Count of Ortenburg: Count Gabriel von Salamanca-Ortenburg. The latter had come to Germany in 1524 as follower of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and was enfeoffed with the Carinthian County. Christoph and his associates claimed to the Emperor that they should be recognized as the true heirs to the County in Carinthia, but were unsuccessful. From then on, therefore, Christoph named his family \\"Counts of Ortenburg of the older family\\" and modified the name from the original \\"Ortenberg\\" into \\"Ortenburg\\". As a further signal of their claim, in the middle of the 16th century the Bavarian counts took the coat of arms of the Carinthian county as a part of their coat of arms. The claim was maintained until the middle of the 18th century, but then dropped. The coat of arms was restored in the middle of the 19th century to the original line embattled- counter-embattled on a red ground.

In late 2008, Aston Martin debuted an updated version of the N24, with the newer Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which featured a larger 4.7-litre engine. Development Sebastian Vettel racing an Aston Martin Vantage N24 During the 2006 British Motor Show in London, Aston Martin Racing revealed a near stock version of the V8 Vantage that would compete in the N√ºrburgring 24 Hours (N24) endurance race. While essentially much like the existing V8 Vantage coup√©, the N24 has a front splitter and extended door sills for aerodynamic efficiency, a full roll cage, a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy. Other modifications include the removal of most of the interior, including all seats, replaced by a lone Recaro drivers seat and polycarbonate windows which helped reduce weight by . The brakes and suspension are also uprated, featuring enlarged front and rear anti-roll bars, adjustable dampers, modified subframe for increased camber and castor, cast magnesium wheels and racing brake pads. The engine is a modified version of the road car's engine, including lightened and balanced internals, re-profiled cylinder heads and the engine management system tuned for race use. The engine would now produce , more than the standard road car. After the car was introduced, Aston Martin confirmed that they would offer the V8 Vantage N24 to customers as a track car similar to a Porsche 911 GT3 Cup. The V8 Vantage N24 is legal for use in the FIA GT4 European Cup, German VLN series, Grand-Am Cup, and various other national series. Contrary to Porsche however, Dr. Bez announced that they would not put a premium price on the N24 and that, while it was only produced in limited numbers, cost just about as much as a regular V8 Vantage. Aston Martin planned to build 24 cars to honor the N√ºrburgring 24h race but at all, they only built 15 cars with chassis number N240001 up to N240015 (N240013 was not built) and the prototype \\"Rose\\" at the special vehicle operation department in Gaydon. The Vantage N24 was on sale with prices starting at approximately ¬£78,720 excluding local taxes and delivery. This rose to ¬£84,500 in 2007 for the standard car and ¬£95,000 for FIA GT4 spec. Racing history The Aston Martin V8 Vantage N24 first competed at the N√ºrburgring 24 Hours. Driven by Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez, development engineer Chris Porrit, development driver Wolfgang Schuhbauer and German journalist Horst Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch in the 24 hour race. The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being driven home on public roads after the race. The N24 was featured in the British TV series Top Gear and driven by James May in a quest to find the best road for driving in Europe. The decision to use the \\"racing version\\" for this kind of drive was mocked by Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson as the car lacked air conditioning and other comforts. May eventually had to drive naked, while pouring bottles of cold water over himself. Additional racing success for the V8 Vantage in N24 trim included a first and second at the 2007 European GT4 race at Silverstone, the first 3 places in their class for the 2 works N24 called \\"Kermit\\" and \\"Rose\\" and a private Team car chassis number N240011 called \\"Barry\\" at the 2008 Nurburgring 24 hours race (18th out of 220 cars entered overall), and strong showings in Bahrain (8th), VLN racing, and other tracks and events throughout the world.http://www.astonmartin.com/eng/thecars/v8vantage/v8vantagen24 The N24 was also the basis of a one-make pan-Asia series called Aston Martin Asia Cup (AMAC). Competitors ran in identical N24s at various Asian circuits.
