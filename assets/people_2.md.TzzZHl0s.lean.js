He was born 04 Jan 1863 in Columbus, Ohio to Nathan Strauss and Hanna Strauss nee Heilberg. He later changed his name to Frank Vance Storrs. He married Amanda Mayer 18 Sep 1906 in Cleveland Ohio. They had two daughters, Carolyn Mayer Storrs and Anne Mayer Storrs. He died 09 Mar 1939 at age 66 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Strauss began by collecting ads for the Madison Square TheatreTheater Playbills and Programs. memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vsprge.html and transformed the programme from a four page leaflet into a magazine playbill that included advertisements along with the credits.Bordman, Gerald and Thomas Hischak. The Oxford Companion to American Theatre. New York: Oxford Uni. Press, 2004.(p 502) Strauss began his work in 1884, and a year later recruited companies like Caswell Massey, Runkel Brothers Cocoa, and Schirmer Pianos to be advertised in his programs.Bloom, Ken. Broadway: Its History, People, and Places: An Encyclopedia. New York: Routland, 2004. In 1891, Strauss merged with his main competitor and, by 1905, standardized the \\"design and layout of the programs so that the makeup would be easier and the sizes of advertising space uniform.\\" Because the programs were made of such a higher quality, audiences were collecting them as souvenirs. Strauss, along with other publishers, started to create albums and leather-bound volumes specifically for collecting programs.Higgins, Sydney. A History of Playbills and Theatre Programs. www.the-camerino-players.com/playbills/index.html In 1918, Strauss sold the company to his nephew, Richard M. Huber. Under Huber the company's name changed to The Magazine Theater Program and, by 1924, was printing 16,000,000 playbills for over 60 theatres. This was the beginning of Huber's monopoly over program printing for Broadway theatres. Although Strauss founded the idea for the magazine playbill, Huber is given credit for starting the New York Theater Program Corporation, which in 1934-35 titled its magazines The Playbill. The Playbill layout varied during this time. The more successful a show the more pages The Playbill contained. Anything Goes was 48 pages while the Post Road was only 12 pages. Advertisements could also subscribe to a specific show and not a whole season. This was evident when advertisements contained the show's title within their ads. During the production of Rain or Shine Rogers Peet Company clothing store placed an ad that read ‚ÄúRain or shine Scotch Mists are fine. Handsome, stylish overcoats that are wetproof too!‚Äù Advertisements were not the only additions to the playbill, but also short articles that discussed fashion, car care, book reviews, interviews, and even jokes.Viagas, Robert. Playbill Magazine Celebrates 124 Years in the Biz Sept. 21. www.playbill.com/news/article/133027-Playbill-Magazine- Celebrates-125-Years-in-the-Biz-Sept-21. 21 September 2009 In 1956, after 70 years as a family company, Huber sold The Playbill to producer and real estate magnate Roger L. Stevens. Stevens changed the name simply to Playbill and no longer allowed a production's image to dominate the cover. Instead, the cover was a generic design with the play's information located inside the Playbill. Public outcry forced Stevens to allow a colorful band to strip across the top of the Playbill with the show's information printed underneath. Over time the colorful band generalized into the yellow strip that is still common in today's Playbill. Theatre playbills have become very valuable articles of information to a city or nation‚Äôs cultural history. The current Playbill collects samples of all their publications, which helps researchers understand what genre of theatre was being produced during a particular decade. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed all of Playbill‚Äôs theatre listings prior to 1924.Botto, Louis. At This Theatre: 100 Years of Broadway Shows, Stories, and Stars.

It aired May 6, 2010 on NBC. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael suspects Donna is cheating on him, and he pays Dwight $50 plus expenses to investigate. Meanwhile, Darryl pranks Andy into believing he has uncovered a company conspiracy. The episode was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, their third writing credit of the season after \\"The Lover\\" and \\"Scott's Tots.\\" It was directed by Rainn Wilson, who also portrays Dwight Schrute on the show, marking his television directorial debut.http://www.officetally.com/the-office-the-cover-up Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is in good spirits due to his wildly successful relationship with Donna (Amy Pietz). He calls an office meeting solely to get suggestions for their next date, but the meeting participants, particularly Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), convince him that she might be cheating on him. Worried, Michael hires Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to tail her to see if she spends time with anyone else. Dwight follows Donna to her gym and attempts to seduce her. Donna rebukes him and calls security on him, whereby he openly admits he was sent there by Michael to keep tabs on her. An enraged Donna comes to the office to talk to Michael about the whole situation, and the two forgive each other and reconcile by planning a private vacation together. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) receives a call from a concerned client that a Sabre printer caught fire during a routine operation. He becomes frustrated when Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) fails to take his client's complaint seriously. Capitalizing on his fears, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) pranks Andy into believing he has uncovered a conspiracy as revenge for Andy pinning one of his mistakes on the warehouse a few years prior. He pays Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) to threaten him, and further convinces Andy that the conspirators intend to kill him. Gabe eventually tells Andy that he consulted corporate, who confirmed that only 12 out of 400,000 printers have caught fire, and gives Andy a $5 gift card as thanks for bringing the matter to their attention. This assuages Andy's suspicions, but Darryl is still able to convince him that he needs to go public with proof that the printers are faulty. He films Andy testing the printer in normal use. Though Darryl intends to use the video to further embarrass Andy, the printer indeed catches fire and explodes. This confirms Andy's suspicions, and scares Darryl straight. While Donna and Michael are planning their trip, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) becomes suspicious when she notices Donna wearing heart-shaped jewelry that Michael did not buy for her. She snoops around on Facebook, and finds recent pictures of Donna hugging and kissing another man. Pam shows Michael the pictures, and he confronts Donna with the evidence. Donna admits to cheating and reveals that it is Michael who is the \\"other guy\\"; the photos are of her and her husband. Production Rainn Wilson, who also plays Dwight Schrute, made his television directorial debut with this episode. The episode was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, their third writing credit of the season after \\"The Lover\\" and \\"Scott's Tots.\\" It was directed by Rainn Wilson, who also portrays Dwight Schrute on the show, marking his television directorial debut. He is the fourth actor of the series to make a directorial debut this season after B. J. Novak, John Krasinski, and Mindy Kaling. Cast members Steve Carell and Paul Lieberstein also directed episodes this season, though they had previously directed for the series. This episode was dedicated to the memory of Larry Einhorn, whose son, Randall Einhorn, has directed 11 previous episodes of the series, served as this episode's consultant and cinematographer, and went on to direct other episodes including the next episode. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"The Cover-Up\\" was watched by 6.84 million viewers with a 3.5 rating and a 10 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Cindy White of IGN gave the episode an 8.0/10, saying it was \\"Impressive\\" and \\"While 'The Cover-Up' did manage to move along two story threads leading up to the end of the season, it wasn't really a standout episode, especially in contrast to last week's. There weren't as many quotable lines or memorable moments as I usually expect from The Office.‚Äù Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí, writing \\"It's an extremely adept episode, skillfully blending its themes with a solid structure and tons of good jokes in a way that this season has rarely achieved\\", but said the episode wasn't as good as the other NBC Comedy Night Done Right shows, Community and Parks and Recreation. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly said \\"The episode was called 'The Cover-Up,' and even if it didn‚Äôt quite follow through on the promise of that opening scene, it was a good little ditty.\\" James Poniewozik of Time gave the episode a positive review writing \\"Credit to the show for setting that up (Michael realizing he is a mistress), though it eluded me and, I suppose, everyone else not versed in the secret signals of heart-shaped jewelry. Steve Carell submitted this episode for Emmy voting when he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

Early life and career Around 1961, at the age of 29, Imperial tried to launch the career of Roberto Carlos as a \\"prince of bossa nova\\", producing his first album, Crazy For You. However, his pupil was accused of shamelessly imitating Joao Gilberto, and the album failed. But he continued until he was signed to CBS in 1958 as a producer. At that time he was known as \\"Dad\\". In the early 1970s, Imperial became a controversial judge on a talent show presented by Chacrinha. At the end of the decade, he presented TV Tupi as an attraction on Saturday nights; it later migrated to TVS - Canal 11 Rio de Janeiro. Imperial was also a columnist for the magazine Amiga, published by Bloch Publishing from 1969. His column was characterised by its irreverence. At the 1984 Carnival, Imperial became famous for releasing the notes of the jurors in the parades of the samba schools in Rio. Every time a maximum score was awarded he exclaimed loudly \\"dez, nota dez\\" (\\"ten! ten points!\\"). This sentence appealed to popular taste, gaining him real support. He was elected an alderman of Rio de Janeiro in 1982. He ran for mayor of Rio in 1985, but lost the election. He later became an author of the well-known 1960s song \\"A Pra√ßa\\" (\\"the square\\"), the Ronnie Von hit that became the opening theme of the humorous television programme A Pra√ßa √â Nossa (\\"the square is ours\\"). Personal life Imperial had a daughter Maria Luiza and a son Marco Antonio from his marriage to Rose Gracie, the daughter of Carlos Gracie from the Gracie Family. Maria Luiza married her second cousin Rorion Gracie and had two daughters that were the love of his life as he would claim named Riane and Rose. Rose took care of her grandfather for the last few months of his life and moved to the US soon after Imperial's death and has lived there since then. She has three daughters. Riane also moved to the US and has one daughter. Marco Antonio got involved with the Santo Daime and has become a prominent figure in that religion. Death Imperial was a victim of the rare disease myasthenia gravis. After an operation to remove his thymus, he died on November 4, 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, at the age of 56.

Biography=Germany He was the only son of a physician, Conrad Kiefer. His mother was a daughter of the gardener of the Grand Duke in Karlsruhe. Thus, he was brought up in a conservative environment and trained to respect the established order of things. He attended gymnasia at Freiburg, Mannheim, and Karlsruhe. His childhood hero was Frederick the Great. He wrote his first poem, \\"The Death of Socrates,\\" in 1839, while at Freiburg. He continued writing poems for the rest of his life, and spent much of his youth wandering in the Black Forest. At Mannheim, Karl Blind was his mentor and introduced him to the circle of Gustav Struve. He studied medicine at Freiburg (1844‚Äì1845; 1846‚Äì1847; 1848‚Äì1849), Heidelberg (1845‚Äì1846), Prague (one semester, 1848), and Vienna (one semester, 1848). He passed his state examinations at Carlsruhe, and received his license to practice medicine on 29 May 1849. In Heidelberg, he was a member of Corps Suevia society; in Freiburg, he joined a Turnerverein, and helped found the Alberta society. He was a delegate to the Offenburg meetings of 12 September 1847 and 19 March 1848, and chairman of the mass meeting at Freiburg on 26 March 1848. He served as surgeon to the Army of the Republic of Baden (the revolutionaries) in the volunteer regiment of Emmendingen during the revolution of 1849, taking part in the battle of Philippsburg (20 June 1849) and Ubstadt (23 June 1849). On the advice of a family friend to his father, he became a fugitive on 10 July 1849, Strassbourg being the initial target of his flight. United States He arrived in the United States in September 1849, and settled in Detroit in October, where he began the practice of medicine on the 19th of that month. He was actively interested in German-American affairs. He gave the oration for the celebration of the centennial of Friedrich Schiller's birth in Detroit in 1859, and was a founder of the German-American seminary, of which he was president and treasurer 1861-1872. He was a member of the Detroit Board of Education 1866-1867, and in 1882 he became a member of the Public Library Commission, being re-elected in 1883 for a term of six years, and adding to the library a large collection of German works. He was a regent of the University of Michigan 1889-1901. He was chairman of the German Republican executive committee of Utica in 1854, a presidential elector in 1872, and a delegate to the Republican National Convention of Cincinnati in 1876. In 1883 he was appointed by President Arthur U.S. Consul to Stettin, which office he held until he resigned in 1885. He prepared valuable articles, which were published in the U. S. consular reports, and include American Trade with Stettin, How Germany is Governed, and Labor in Europe. Family He married Franciska Kehle of Bonndorf on 21 July 1850. She died 6 August 1909.

It occurs in most of India, eastern Pakistan and the eastern lowlands of Nepal, and recently from Sri Lanka. Taxonomy This species was named Scorpio tamulus by J.C. Fabricius in 1798. The species name was apparently derived from the occurrence in the state/province of the Tamil people of southeastern India. It was later often referred to the genera Buthus or Mesobuthus, although it was already correctly placed in Hottentotta by A. A. Birula in 1914, a referral that was confirmed again by F. Kova≈ô√≠k in 2007. Nevertheless, the binomen Mesobuthus tamulus is traditionally widespread in the popular and scientific literature. R.I. Pocock (1900) distinguished five subspecies according to coloration and distribution, but these are color-morphs (individuals with varying color) rather than subspecies. Description Hottentotta tamulus from Satara, Maharashtra, India Hottentotta tamulus with babies H. tamulus specimen range in size from 5‚Äì9 cm. The coloration ranges from dark orange or brightly red- brown through dull brown with darker grey carinae (ridges) and granulation. Grey spots might be distributed irregularly across the cephalothorax and the mesosoma. The walking legs and the tip of the pedipalp pincers are brighter colored (orange-yellow to light reddish-brown). The mesosomal tergites always bear three distinct carinae. Their habitus is typical of buthid scorpions, with rather small pedipalp pincers, moderately thickened metasomal segments and a rather bulbous telson with large stinger. The base of the pedipalp pincers (manus) is slightly more inflated in males than in females. Toxicity This species is of great medical significance in densely populated areas of India and Nepal and occasionally causes human fatalities. Fatality rates of 8‚Äì40% have been reported in clinical studies; most victims are children. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include: * Severe local pain * Vomiting * Sweating * Priapism * Cyanosis * Unconsciousness * Muscular convulsions * Breathlessness * Pink frothy sputum * Abnormal heart rhythms * A fast or slow heart rate * Low or high blood pressure * Acute myocarditis * Shock The venom mainly affects the cardiovascular and pulmonary system, eventually leading to a pulmonary oedema, which may cause death. Scorpion antivenom has little effect in clinical treatment but application of prazosin reduces the mortality rate to less than 4%. As in other scorpions, the venom of H. tamulus consists of a complex mixture of proteins. Some major components have been isolated, including the toxin tamapin. Scorpion envenomation with high morbidity and mortality is usually due to either excessive autonomic activity and cardiovascular toxic effects or neuromuscular toxic effects. Antivenin is the specific treatment for scorpion envenomation combined with supportive measures including vasodilators in patients with cardiovascular toxic effects and benzodiazepines when there is neuromuscular involvement. Although rare, severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis to scorpion antivenin (SAV) are possible. Habitat and ecology Despite its medical importance, little is known about the ecology and habitat preferences of this species. It is widespread across vegetated lowlands with subtropical to tropical, humid climate and often lives close to or in human settlements, especially in rural areas. A study from Saswad-Jejuri, Pune (western India) has found H. tamulus in a wide range of microhabitats, including scrubland and veld with stones, red and black soil in cropland, loamy, grassy and stony hillslopes and -tops, black soil in mango orchards, Eucalyptus plantations, and under tree bark. With an abundance of 48.43% it was by far the most abundant of the six scorpion species recorded in this study. It occurs rather seldom under tree bark, a habitat dominated by its sister species Hottentotta pachyurus (8.9% versus 91.1% abundance). As all other scorpions, H. tamulus is nocturnal, preying upon small invertebrates and even small vertebrates like lizards. Encounters with humans mainly occur during the night or early morning, when the scorpions accidentally crawl into beds or fall from ceilings. In Sri Lanka Originally, H. tamulus was not found in Sri Lanka. But from 2010 to 2013, experiments and other medical reports suggest that the species is also present in Sri Lanka. Few deaths were recorded from Jaffna peninsula in recent times. After observing medical reports and patients, a research team found three dead scorpion specimens and five live specimens as well. After series of observations from research team and other international scientists, it was revealed that the scorpion specimens belong to the species H. tamulus. Deaths from H. tamulus were recorded in 2006, 2007 and 2009 as one patient per year. No cases were recorded in 2010. In 2011, 12 children in Jaffna died due to H. tamulus stings. In 2012, 80 patients were recorded. Out of them, 52% were female, 48% were male. 30% from them were children between the age 3 and 12. In 2013, many H. tamulus stings were recorded, as many as four each week, again mostly in women and children. Usually, the drug Prazosin is recommended for H. tamulus stings. The drug can reduce the increasing blood pressure.

The conjugate gradient method can be derived from several different perspectives, including specialization of the conjugate direction method for optimization, and variation of the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration for eigenvalue problems. The intent of this article is to document the important steps in these derivations. Derivation from the conjugate direction method The conjugate gradient method can be seen as a special case of the conjugate direction method applied to minimization of the quadratic function :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=\\\\boldsymbol{x}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{A}\\\\boldsymbol{x}-2\\\\boldsymbol{b}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\text{.} The conjugate direction method In the conjugate direction method for minimizing :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=\\\\boldsymbol{x}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{A}\\\\boldsymbol{x}-2\\\\boldsymbol{b}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\text{.} one starts with an initial guess \\\\boldsymbol{x}_0 and the corresponding residual \\\\boldsymbol{r}_0=\\\\boldsymbol{b}-\\\\boldsymbol{Ax}_0, and computes the iterate and residual by the formulae :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_i&=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}{\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{x}_{i+1}&=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_i+\\\\alpha_i\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}&=\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i-\\\\alpha_i\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i \\\\end{align} where \\\\boldsymbol{p}_0,\\\\boldsymbol{p}_1,\\\\boldsymbol{p}_2,\\\\ldots are a series of mutually conjugate directions, i.e., :\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_j=0 for any i eq j. The conjugate direction method is imprecise in the sense that no formulae are given for selection of the directions \\\\boldsymbol{p}_0,\\\\boldsymbol{p}_1,\\\\boldsymbol{p}_2,\\\\ldots. Specific choices lead to various methods including the conjugate gradient method and Gaussian elimination. Derivation from the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration The conjugate gradient method can also be seen as a variant of the Arnoldi/Lanczos iteration applied to solving linear systems. The general Arnoldi method In the Arnoldi iteration, one starts with a vector \\\\boldsymbol{r}_0 and gradually builds an orthonormal basis {\\\\boldsymbol{v}_1,\\\\boldsymbol{v}_2,\\\\boldsymbol{v}_3,\\\\ldots} of the Krylov subspace :\\\\mathcal{K}(\\\\boldsymbol{A},\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0)=\\\\mathrm{span}{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0,\\\\boldsymbol{Ar}_0,\\\\boldsymbol{A}^2\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0,\\\\ldots} by defining \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{w}_i/\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{w}_i\\\\rVert_2 where :\\\\boldsymbol{w}_i=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\boldsymbol{r}_0 & \\\\text{if }i=1\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1}-\\\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}(\\\\boldsymbol{v}_j^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1})\\\\boldsymbol{v}_j & \\\\text{if }i>1\\\\text{.} \\\\end{cases} In other words, for i>1, \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i is found by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalizing \\\\boldsymbol{Av}_{i-1} against {\\\\boldsymbol{v}_1,\\\\boldsymbol{v}_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{i-1}} followed by normalization. Put in matrix form, the iteration is captured by the equation :\\\\boldsymbol{AV}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{V}_{i+1}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tilde{H}}_i where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{V}_i&=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{v}_1 & \\\\boldsymbol{v}_2 & \\\\cdots & \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tilde{H}}_i&=\\\\begin{bmatrix} h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13} & \\\\cdots & h_{1,i}\\\\ h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23} & \\\\cdots & h_{2,i}\\\\ & h_{32} & h_{33} & \\\\cdots & h_{3,i}\\\\ & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\ & & & h_{i,i-1} & h_{i,i}\\\\ & & & & h_{i+1,i} \\\\end{bmatrix}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{H}_i\\\\ h_{i+1,i}\\\\boldsymbol{e}_i^\\\\mathrm{T} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{align} with :h_{ji}=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\boldsymbol{v}_j^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Av}_i & \\\\text{if }j\\\\leq i\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{w}_{i+1}\\\\rVert_2 & \\\\text{if }j=i+1\\\\text{,}\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if }j>i+1\\\\text{.} \\\\end{cases} When applying the Arnoldi iteration to solving linear systems, one starts with \\\\boldsymbol{r}_0=\\\\boldsymbol{b}-\\\\boldsymbol{Ax}_0, the residual corresponding to an initial guess \\\\boldsymbol{x}_0. After each step of iteration, one computes \\\\boldsymbol{y}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{H}_i^{-1}(\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{e}_1) and the new iterate \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i. The direct Lanczos method For the rest of discussion, we assume that \\\\boldsymbol{A} is symmetric positive-definite. With symmetry of \\\\boldsymbol{A}, the upper Hessenberg matrix \\\\boldsymbol{H}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{AV}_i becomes symmetric and thus tridiagonal. It then can be more clearly denoted by :\\\\boldsymbol{H}_i=\\\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_2\\\\ b_2 & a_2 & b_3\\\\ & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots\\\\ & & b_{i-1} & a_{i-1} & b_i\\\\ & & & b_i & a_i \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\text{.} This enables a short three-term recurrence for \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i in the iteration, and the Arnoldi iteration is reduced to the Lanczos iteration. Since \\\\boldsymbol{A} is symmetric positive-definite, so is \\\\boldsymbol{H}_i. Hence, \\\\boldsymbol{H}_i can be LU factorized without partial pivoting into :\\\\boldsymbol{H}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{L}_i\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ c_2 & 1\\\\ & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots\\\\ & & c_{i-1} & 1\\\\ & & & c_i & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} d_1 & b_2\\\\ & d_2 & b_3\\\\ & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots\\\\ & & & d_{i-1} & b_i\\\\ & & & & d_i \\\\end{bmatrix} with convenient recurrences for c_i and d_i: :\\\\begin{align} c_i&=b_i/d_{i-1}\\\\text{,}\\\\ d_i&=\\\\begin{cases} a_1 & \\\\text{if }i=1\\\\text{,}\\\\ a_i-c_ib_i & \\\\text{if }i>1\\\\text{.} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Rewrite \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i\\\\boldsymbol{H}_i^{-1}(\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{e}_1)\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-1}\\\\boldsymbol{L}_i^{-1}(\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{e}_1)\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{P}_i\\\\boldsymbol{z}_i \\\\end{align} with :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{P}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{V}_{i}\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-1}\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{z}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{L}_i^{-1}(\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{e}_1)\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} It is now important to observe that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{P}_i&=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{P}_{i-1} & \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{z}_i&=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{z}_{i-1}\\\\ \\\\zeta_i \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} In fact, there are short recurrences for \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i and \\\\zeta_i as well: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i&=\\\\frac{1}{d_i}(\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i- b_i\\\\boldsymbol{p}_{i-1})\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\zeta_i&=-c_i\\\\zeta_{i-1}\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} With this formulation, we arrive at a simple recurrence for \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{P}_i\\\\boldsymbol{z}_i\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{P}_{i-1}\\\\boldsymbol{z}_{i-1}+\\\\zeta_i\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{i-1}+\\\\zeta_i\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} The relations above straightforwardly lead to the direct Lanczos method, which turns out to be slightly more complex. The conjugate gradient method from imposing orthogonality and conjugacy If we allow \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i to scale and compensate for the scaling in the constant factor, we potentially can have simpler recurrences of the form: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{i-1}+\\\\alpha_{i-1}\\\\boldsymbol{p}_{i-1}\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i-1}-\\\\alpha_{i-1}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_{i-1}\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i+\\\\beta_{i-1}\\\\boldsymbol{p}_{i-1}\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} As premises for the simplification, we now derive the orthogonality of \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i and conjugacy of \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i, i.e., for i eq j, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_j&=0\\\\text{,}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_j&=0\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} The residuals are mutually orthogonal because \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i is essentially a multiple of \\\\boldsymbol{v}_{i+1} since for i=0, \\\\boldsymbol{r}_0=\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{v}_1, for i>0, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{b}-\\\\boldsymbol{Ax}_i\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{b}-\\\\boldsymbol{A}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0+\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i)\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0-\\\\boldsymbol{AV}_i\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0-\\\\boldsymbol{V}_{i+1}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tilde{H}}_i\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0-\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i\\\\boldsymbol{H}_i\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i- h_{i+1,i}(\\\\boldsymbol{e}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i)\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{i+1}\\\\ &=\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{v}_1-\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i(\\\\lVert\\\\boldsymbol{r}_0\\\\rVert_2\\\\boldsymbol{e}_1)-h_{i+1,i}(\\\\boldsymbol{e}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i)\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{i+1}\\\\ &=-h_{i+1,i}(\\\\boldsymbol{e}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{y}_i)\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{i+1}\\\\text{.}\\\\end{align} To see the conjugacy of \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i, it suffices to show that \\\\boldsymbol{P}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{AP}_i is diagonal: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{P}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{AP}_i&=\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\boldsymbol{V}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{AV}_i\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-1}\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\boldsymbol{H}_i\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-1}\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\boldsymbol{L}_i\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-1}\\\\ &=\\\\boldsymbol{U}_i^{-\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\boldsymbol{L}_i \\\\end{align} is symmetric and lower triangular simultaneously and thus must be diagonal. Now we can derive the constant factors \\\\alpha_i and \\\\beta_i with respect to the scaled \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i by solely imposing the orthogonality of \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i and conjugacy of \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i. Due to the orthogonality of \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i, it is necessary that \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i=(\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i-\\\\alpha_i\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i)^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i=0. As a result, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_i&=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}{(\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i-\\\\beta_{i-1}\\\\boldsymbol{p}_{i-1})^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}{\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} Similarly, due to the conjugacy of \\\\boldsymbol{p}_i, it is necessary that \\\\boldsymbol{p}_{i+1}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i=(\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}+\\\\beta_i\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i)^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i=0. As a result, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\beta_i&=-\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}{\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}\\\\ &=-\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}^\\\\mathrm{T}(\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i-\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1})}{\\\\alpha_i\\\\boldsymbol{p}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{Ap}_i}\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{i+1}}{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}\\\\text{.} \\\\end{align} This completes the derivation.

He was also the Democratic nominee for United States Senator from Oregon in 1986. After retiring from politics in 1992, Bauman began organizing bicycle tours and was a founder of Portland Bridge Pedal, an annual bicycle tour crossing all the bridges in Portland. Early life and career Bauman was born in 1950 in Marinette, Wisconsin and is the grandson of Harvey V. Higley, who served as Veteran's Administration director under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Bauman moved with his family to Santa Clara, California where he graduated from high school, and then enrolled at UC Santa Cruz where he received a bachelor's degree in anthropology. Bauman spent a year in India setting up a public health program before relocating to Portland, Oregon, where he transferred to Portland State University and earned another bachelor's degree, this time in biology. Now married to Judy, who was attending law school, Bauman drove taxis and worked as a home remodeler while helping raise the couple's two daughters. Bauman applied to Oregon Health Sciences University with hopes of becoming a doctor, but was not admitted. Political career Having been energized by liberal Democratic politics while at UC Santa Cruz, Bauman worked on Jerry Brown's 1976 Presidential campaign. In 1978, Bauman was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives, representing District 11 in Portland. He was re- elected three times (his district was renumbered to District 13 in 1983) and was elected speaker pro tempore twice. An outspoken progressive and opponent of nuclear power, Bauman demonstrated for the closing of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in 1979. In 1979, Bauman announced a run for the United States House of Representatives for Oregon's 3rd congressional district, but later withdrew and sought re-election to the Oregon House. In 1981, he ran unsuccessfully for the Portland school board, and in 1983, announced his intention to run for Portland mayor, but again withdrew and ran again for his Oregon House seat. In 1986, Bauman resigned his seat in favor of his wife to run for the Democratic nomination in the 1986 U.S. Senate election in Oregon. To draw attention to his candidacy, he hiked across the state from California to Washington, but came in third in a race won by U.S. Congressman Jim Weaver. However, after the primaries, a House Ethics Committee probe into Weaver's campaign finances led him to withdrew his candidacy and the Oregon Democratic State Central Committee selected Bauman to replace Weaver on the ballot in August, just 10 weeks before the general election against three-term incumbent Bob Packwood. Packwood went on to defeat Bauman 63%‚Äì36%. Following his loss in the Senate race, Bauman began working with the poor and homeless in Portland, organizing vigils and protests to draw attention to their plight. In 1987, he staged a solid-food fast to urge the Oregon Legislature to increase funding for social services, ending it when Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt proposed funding increases. Bauman became vice chairman of the Burnside Community Council, a service center for homeless adults in Portland, but later resigned in protest after the council voted to keep secret a report detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against the founder of the council; Bauman opposed the decision. Bauman was elected to the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners in 1988. In 1990, Bauman was the target of a recall campaign after he wrote a controversial gun control law, but survived the recall. Two years later, he was defeated for re-election to the commission board by Tanya Collier. Bicycle tours Following his loss, Bauman announced that he was finished with politics and began organizing bicycle tours. In 1994, he organized Cycle Vietnam, the first large-scale American bicycle tour of that country. In 1996, Bauman created Portland Bridge Pedal, a bicycle tour with a route over all 10 Portland bridges that cross the Willamette River. Bauman said he was inspired to organize such an event after he had a view of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens from the Marquam Bridge in his car and thought bicyclists should have a chance to enjoy the views normally available only to drivers. The first event drew 7,500 riders; Providence Health & Services began sponsoring the event a year later and renamed it the Providence Bridge Pedal. By 2007, the tour was the third-largest of the largest organized cycle tours in the world, behind New York City's Five Boro Bike Tour and Montreal's Tour de l'√éle. Bauman is still involved with the event. Personal Bauman divorced Judy Bauman in 1987, and has since remarried twice. He is currently married to Ginnie Cooper, formerly the head librarian of the Multnomah County Library system, and now the chief librarian of the District of Columbia Public Library system.

About 1830 he was rabbi in Schwerin-on-the-Warthe, whence he removed to Hungary. Here G√∂tz Kohn, rabbi of Baja and a native of Schwerin, recommended him to the congregation of , in the county of Borsod, which elected him rabbi in 1833. His violent temper soon made him many enemies. He pronounced a decree of divorce which brought upon him the enmity of the rabbi of Sz√°nt√≥, Eleazar L√∂w (), whose contention was that no divorce had ever been pronounced in Csaba, because of the uncertainty of the Hebrew transliteration of the name, and therefore it was not lawful to grant a divorce in this place. Alexandersohn's enemies were encouraged by this contention to bring charges against him, and prevailed upon L√∂w to try him for heresy and for violations of the dietary and ritual laws. He was accused of disbelieving in a hereafter; of saying that he would take a lenient view in all legal questions; of sleeping bareheaded; of walking four cubits from his bed without washing his hands; and of other violations of Jewish rites. In 1835 a court, composed of three rabbis, declared him unworthy of the rabbinical office. Moses Sofer, chief rabbi of Pozsony (Pressburg), and Moses Teitelbaum, rabbi of √öjhely, the leader of the Hasidim in Hungary, confirmed this decision. Alexandersohn appealed to the civil courts in vain; but Solomon Rosenthal, a prominent member of the congregation in Budapest, and his old friend G√∂tz Kohn of Schwerin, took up his case, and appointed a committee of five rabbis to consider it. The committee cleared him of all charges, and ordered the congregation to pay him 800 florins in damages. Alexandersohn would not accept this indemnity, but demanded to be reinstated in his office. He brought other lawsuits against the congregation, and traveled through Germany, Belgium, France, England, and Italy in order to interest other rabbis and laymen in his behalf. Among those who defended him was Zecharias Frankel, then rabbi of Dresden, who addressed a letter to Moses Sofer, urging the latter to rescind his decision. All these efforts were unsuccessful, and in 1846 Alexandersohn published, in German and Hebrew, the documents relating to his case. He was finally reduced to beggary and thrown on public charity for his support, living the life of a tramp. He died in the Jewish hospital of Altofen on November 24, 1869.

Guest stars in this episode include Bryan Batt, Neal Bledsoe, Grant Bowler, Alec Mapa, Ryan McGinnis, Matt Newton and Adam Rodr√≠guez. The episode focuses on Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) struggling to tell her friend and boss, Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius) about her new job in London. At the same time, Betty's sister, Hilda (Ana Ortiz) tries to keep their father from finding out she is moving to Manhattan. Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams) recovers from being shot by Tyler (Neal Bledsoe) and Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton) finally finds her father. \\"Hello Goodbye\\" has received critical acclaim from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 5.43 million viewers during its original broadcast, which was a season high. It received a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) worries about her boss Daniel Meade's (Eric Mabius) reaction to the news that she is leaving fashion magazine MODE for a new job in London. Marc St. James (Michael Urie) overhears Betty talking about her new job and sends a mass text to everyone in the building. Daniel tells Betty that he knows about her new job and says he is fine, however, he later burns her contract release form and tells her that he is angry that she is leaving. He then offers Betty a promotion, which she turns down, and he does not come to her farewell party. Meanwhile, MODE co-editor Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams) is in a coma after being shot by Tyler Meade-Hartley (Neal Bledsoe). When she wakes up, her partner Connor Owens (Grant Bowler) tells her that he cannot live without her. Tyler's mother Claire Meade (Judith Light) offers Wilhelmina a bribe to say Tyler did not shoot her, but Wilhelmina rejects it and plans to stake her claim on the company, prompting Marc to tell her she will never be happy. Wilhelmina holds a press conference, where she states that she accidentally shot herself. Claire thanks her and Wilhelmina tells her that they are now good. Daniel informs Wilhelmina that he is stepping down as co-editor of MODE, leaving her in charge. Betty's sister Hilda Suarez (Ana Ortiz) and her husband Bobby (Adam Rodr√≠guez) look for an apartment in Manhattan, but Hilda worries that their father Ignacio Suarez (Tony Plana) will be lonely without them, but Ignacio reassures them that he is happy to live alone. Marc receives a promotion and a second chance with Troy (Matt Newton). Receptionist Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton) finds out that Spencer Cannon (Bryan Batt) is her father, and he reveals that he knew she was his daughter when he hired her to be his stylist. After saying goodbye to her family, Betty is shown enjoying her new life in London. She meets Daniel in Trafalgar Square, where he apologizes to her for not saying goodbye, and asks her out to dinner. Betty jokingly asks if he needs something to do, she is looking for a new assistant and Daniel tells her that he might submit his resume. As Betty heads off to work across Trafalgar Square, the series title is superimposed onto the scene; after a moment, Ugly disappears. Production Bryan Batt guest stars as soap opera star Spencer Cannon. \\"Hello Goodbye\\" was written by Ugly Betty creator and executive producer Silvio Horta and directed by Victor Nelli Jr. The episode originally aired on April 14, 2010 on ABC as the twentieth episode of the series' fourth season and 85th overall. This episode marks the end of Ugly Betty. ABC announced in January 2010 that the series' fourth season was to be the last, following falling ratings. In a joint statement Silvio Horta and ABC Entertainment president Steve McPherson said \\"We've mutually come to the difficult decision to make this Ugly Betty's final season.\\" The network cut the episode order from 22 to 20, but gave the writers enough time to create a satisfying conclusion that was to air on April 14. On what he was set out to accomplish with the series finale, Horta said \\"Primarily, I wanted it to be about Betty's journey, about Betty making it in her professional life, first and foremost, overcoming the obstacles in her past and really succeeding\\". Vanessa Williams said the cancellation of Ugly Betty was \\"devastating\\" for the cast. She said \\"Our cast was one of those rare opportunities where we love each other. It was a real shocker, and really devastating when it all ended\\". For the final scenes of the episode, the cast and crew travelled to London to film around a variety of the city's landmarks. This episode featured a guest appearance from former Mad Men star Bryan Batt, who continued his role as soap opera star Spencer Cannon from the previous episode. It was announced in March 2010 that Batt would star in the final season of Ugly Betty, as a potential love interest for Marc St. James (Michael Urie). Batt is the second Mad Men actor to appear in the final season of the series, following Rich Sommer's appearance in \\"Fire and Nice\\". Reception According to the Nielsen ratings, \\"Hello Goodbye\\" was viewed by 5.43 million viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States. This was an increase of 29 percent from the previous episode, \\"The Past Presents the Future\\", which was watched by 4.0 million American viewers. It earned a 1.8 rating/5 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. \\"Hello Goodbye\\" became the highest viewed episode of the season and number one in its hour. Since airing, the episode has received critical acclaim. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode calling it \\"A super-sweet end to a super-sweet series!\\" Mrs. Northman of television website, TV Fanatic said \\"Overall, \\"Hello Goodbye\\" did wrap up each of our beloved characters lives in a nice pretty bow\\", they added \\"We wanted MORE!\\" However, some critics felt the ending of the episode was not enough. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the episode a mixed review saying it was \\"like one long hug with loved ones you don't want to leave,\\" but added the conclusion was \\"unsatisfying\\". New York magazine said \\"The cast of Ugly Betty damn well earned a happy ending ‚Äî and that's exactly what creator Silvio Horta gave them last night on the series finale\\". However, they also found the conclusion to be unsatisfying saying \\"The one-hour finale easily could have been longer, meaning some plotlines went unresolved.\\" Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post said \\"Last night, Ugly Betty attempted to earn a place in TV history, but I fear their last episode will be quickly forgotten by the fans\\". Wieselman also added \\"On a show that always favored high drama and cool camp, I was saddened to see everyone get such an expected ending\\". Wieselman, however, did enjoy the final scene calling it \\"pitch-perfect\\".

Life He was born in Penzance in Cornwall on 20 June 1803, the son of Richard Edmonds who was town clerk of Marazion, and his wife Elizabeth. Richard Edmonds was a younger brother. Edmonds attended Penzance Grammar School under George Morris. He then entered Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar in 1822, graduating B.A. in 1826. He worked as an actuary for the Legal and General Life Assurance Society from 1832 to 1866. Edmonds died in Maida Vale on 6 March 1889. Actuary and statistician Edmonds applied the method of Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin for life tables to England, as Joshua Milne had done with data from Carlisle, Cumberland. He became a fellow of the Statistical Society in 1836. Edmonds wrote a series of 15 papers in The Lancet, from 1836 to 1842, on the topic of mortality and health, the first being \\"On the laws of collective vitality\\". It was to be a major influence in the field of epidemiology, as developed by William Farr.http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/papers/SPM%2047(1)%206-13%20Eyler-2.pdf While Edmonds and Farr both did pioneer work on vital statistics, the starting point for Edmonds was the needs of life insurance. For Farr, there were applications to mortality and morbidity. It was from the first paper of the Lancet series that Farr acquired a number of central points that Edmonds was making, in particular about collection of data. Edmonds took to campaigning journalism. In The Lancet, and other periodicals edited by Farr and Thomas Wakley, he wrote polemically, in particular against the officials John Rickman and John Finlaison. Female mortality life tables compared, from an 1852 paper by Thomas Rowe Edmonds Two committees of the Statistical Society involved Edmonds. In 1838 he was the leader of a group of six fellows asking for a committee to work on vital statistics. The plan was to circulate insurance offices with a request for information The matter was taken up by Benjamin Gompertz in correspondence with Charles Babbage. In the end an external group of actuaries was consulted. In 1841 Farr pressed for a committee to collect vital statistics from patients at London hospitals. A distinguished group came together, and two reports were produced.Besides Edmonds, the committee included also John Clendenning, Joseph Fletcher, William Guy, Rawson Rawson, William Henry Sykes, and Alexander Murray Tulloch. In 1852 Edmonds gave evidence to a House of Commons committee on income and property tax. The following year he gave evidence to a committee chaired by James Wilson, on the Legal and General's business practices, and assurance associations in general. Socialist Edmonds is considered a Ricardian socialist,Perelman, p. 82. though this is disputed by Thompson, and an Owenite. He has also been called a \\"co-operative socialist\\". He anticipated Karl Marx in a theory of surplus labour and wages, and in postulating the replacement of capitalism by a later stage, which he called the \\"social system\\". Works Edmonds wrote three books in the period 1828 to 1832. Practical Moral and Political Economy (1828) This work is considered, by J. W. Burrow, to contain evolutionary ideas, Lamarckian and in the style of Erasmus Darwin, and to anticipate Herbert Spencer in introducing such ideas into social thought. On the other hand, Edmonds was a polygenist believing in immutable human species, and no social Darwinist. His analysis of pauperism was inconsistent, but he could attribute it to the effects of private property. F. J. C. Hearnshaw considered that the book foreshadowed Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics.F. J. C. Hearnshaw, Social & political ideas of some representative thinkers of the Victorian Age: a series of lectures delivered at King's College, University of London, during the session 1931‚Äì32 (1950), p. 264; archive.org. Life Tables (1832) In Life Tables, founded upon the discovery of a numerical law regulating the existence of every human being (1832), Edmonds claimed as a new discovery on the mortality rate a model on ageing and mortality found in the 1820s by Benjamin Gompertz. He promoted its application to case fatality risk, to medical professionals.Robert Lee, Early Death and Long Life in History: Establishing the Scale of Premature Death in Europe and its Cultural, Economic and Social Significance Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung Vol. 34, No. 4 (130), Premature Death: Patterns of Identity and Meaning From a Historical Perspective / Vorzeitiger Tod: Identit√§ts- und Sinnstiftung in historischer Perspektive (2009), pp. 23‚Äì60, at p. 28. Published by: GESIS ‚Äì Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences, Center for Historical Social Research. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20762397 He also remarked on many other related topics, such as maximum birth rates and gender mortality differentials. In his mortality theory, Edmonds took up observations of Richard Price, dividing life into three periods (childhood, \\"manhood\\" from age 12 to 55, and old age). He quantified mortality by using different geometric progressions in each period. His table became known as \\"Edmonds's Mean Mortality\\". He persisted into the 1860s with his piecewise approach, though by then with two periods, rather than the sigmoid curve model of Gompertz. But Edmonds came in for some rough handling for his continuing assertions of the independence of his model from that of Gompertz. Augustus De Morgan and Thomas Bond Sprague took him to task during the early 1860s, in the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries. This controversy was later thought to have slowed acceptance of the refinement proposed by William Makeham to the Gompertz model, now the Gompertz‚ÄìMakeham law of mortality.R., The late William Matthew Makeham, Journal of the Institute of Actuaries (1886‚Äì1994) Vol. 30, No. 1 (April 1892), pp. 1‚Äì8 at p. 4.

Garrett Hardin regarded this book as the first important population theory opposed to that of Robert Malthus. It contains an analysis of famine, as caused by export of food, with remarks on the Irish situation. In arguing against Malthus, Edmonds (in common with Richard Jones, Augustus Henry Moreton and George Rickards) laid weight on factors that could cause postponement of marriage.Eversley, p. 257. In general he relied on \\"non- moral\\" effects, and Chapter VIII of the book addressed the possible effects on labourers' fertility of upward mobility.Eversley, p. 74 and p. 108. Edmonds attributed some contemporary social problems to the small extent of the middle class. He rejected \\"Sadler's law\\" put forth by Michael Thomas Sadler two years earlier, to the effect that higher population density led to lower fertility, on the basis of empirical work in some urban areas. Later research by David Heron confirmed Edmonds's findings, which left open the question of urban versus rural fertility.Eversley, pp. 43‚Äì4.

He was a successful business man, which eminently helped him achieve great charitable work, to which he chiefly devoted his attention. He established the Jewish Board of Guardians in London in 1859. Ephraim Alex imparted his zeal and public spirit to the community, which rapidly developed and perfected the organisation. A suggestion had indeed been made as early as 1802 by Joshua Van Oven to replace the loose and imperfect arrangement between the three German synagogues by a definite Board of Guardians for the Jewish poor. This suggestion was, however, lost sight of until 1858, when Alex was overseer of the Great Synagogue. He became impressed that the inadequate system for outdoor charity begun to prevail. He ventilated the subject energetically before his own council and vestry as well as on various public occasions. In February, 1859, he issued a circular proposing \\"a scheme for a Board of Guardians for the relief of the necessitous foreign poor.\\" This scheme exhibited a great insight into the needs of the poor, as well as a comprehensive idea of the machinery necessary to relieve them. The keynote of the circular and scheme was organization, and the subsequent development of the board had been strictly on the lines of Alex's original conception. He was not a man of commanding intellect, but he possessed a genial and tactful disposition which attracted young men to undertake. He was the first president of the board, over which he continued to preside until 1869, when his physical infirmities compelled his retirement; as a member of the board, however, he continued to take part in its deliberations until the year of his death. He was also a life-member of the Council of the United Synagogue, and a member of the Committee of the Jews' Hospital in Mile End.

READ began as a United Kingdom-based charity but has since moved operations mostly to Tanzania. Overview READ International began life in 2004 as a Book Project based at the University of Nottingham, founded by a group of students following a gap year teaching in Tanzania. Since 2005 READ International has shipped a total of 1,303,890 books to Tanzania and renovated 110 libraries to improve access to these books. Since registering as a charity they have had their work recognised in a number of ways, winning Best New Charity in the Charity Times Awards 2007,Charity Times Awards 2007 Shortlist finalists in the Guardian Charity of the Year Awards 2009,Guardian Charity of the Year 2009 and finalists in the Charity Times Awards in 2009.

Focus Countries Tanzania and Uganda follow a secondary school syllabus almost identical to the UK, but teachers often lack the resources needed to teach. In the UK newer editions of books inevitably replace the old (very often only a couple of years old), which makes for good quality, but technically out of date textbooks filling up school store rooms or ending up in landfill. READ International sends them to Tanzania; improving access to education for thousands of students each year. Read for READ In October 2010, READ launched their 'Read for READ' anthology at the British Library in London.British Library Press Release on Read for READ Anthology The anthology is a collection of stories from the Read for READ Short Story Competition, which saw aspiring writers being given the chance to showcase their work, and be judged for final publication by writer Sarfraz Manzoor, publisher Sonny Leong, literary agent Clare Alexander, and the British Library‚Äôs Director of Human Resources, Mary Canavan.

He was acknowledged for his contributions to the field with a MacArthur Fellows Program \\"genius\\" award and the Edward Ullendorff Medal from the Council of the British Academy. He was the first Ethiopian and the first African to win the MacArthur.  Career  He is Regents Professor Emeritus of Medieval Studies at Saint John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, and Curator Emeritus of the Ethiopian Study Center at the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library, where he began work in 1976. At HMML, he prepared catalogues of more than five thousand Ethiopian manuscripts and trained Ethiopic manuscript cataloguers in paleography, dating, and other skills. Previously he was associate professor in the Department of Ethiopian Languages and Literature, Haile Sellasie I University (now Addis Ababa University), from 1962 to 1969, and 1971 to 1974, where he taught Amharic Grammar, Amharic Literature, Ge‚Äôez Grammar, Ge‚Äôez Literature, Arabic Grammar, and Semitic Linguistics. He is on the advisory board of a number of journals, including Comit√© de lecture of Analecta Bollandiana (Journal of Christian Hagiography), Ethiopian Journal of Education, Journal of Ethiopian Studies, Northeast African Studies, Ethiopian Register (1994-2001), and Acta Aethiopica (1980‚Äì89). From 1945 to 1951 he attended Trinity School in Addis Ababa. He moved to Cairo tin 1952, and lived there through most of the 1950s, graduating from the Coptic Theological College, Cairo, Egypt with a B.D. in 1957, and from the American University in Cairo, with a B.A. in 1957. He then moved to Germany in 1957, where he received from the Eberhard-Karls-Universit√§t T√ºbingen a Ph.D. in Semitic Philology in 1962. the title of his dissertation was Das Verbalsystem im √Ñthiopischen: Ein orphologischer Vergleich mit den orientalischen semitischen Sprachen. In addition to his writings and translations of a variety of works on Ethiopia and the Orthodox church, he has produced two 2-volume books on the history and beliefs of Abba Estifanos of Gwendagwende, one in 2006 the other in 2011. His first translation, into Amharic, was of Mark Twain‚Äôs short story Extracts from Adam‚Äôs Diary, in 1965. The languages in which he works are Amharic, Ge'ez, Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, German, and Coptic.  Reputation  Getatchew Haile's work has frequently been described as foundational to the field of Ethiopian studies and he was won many awards. Edward Ullendorff, professor of Semitic studies at the School of Oriental and Asian Studies, described Getatchew Haile's work as \\"highly significant\\" due to his \\"profoundly erudite\\" knowledge of Ethiopic language and literature. On another occasion, Ullendorff wrote that Getatchew Haile's work represented the \\"most meticulous and original study of Ethiopic literature\\" ever done, and \\"on a scale and depth never before attempted.\\" He added, \\"no other person before Getatchew Haile has ever been able to survey so much of Ethiopic literary creation and thus to gain so sovereign a command of this genre,\\" which made a contribution not only to Ethiopian studies but also the study of Christian oriental writing more generally. The Ethiopian poet Amha Asfaw wrote a poem in Amharic for him in 1999.  Personal Life  He was born in Shenkora (in the historical Amhara province of Shoa, Ethiopia). As a boy, he attended Ethiopian Orthodox church school, where he learned Ge'ez and \\"devoted his energies to reading and understanding the texts.\\" Getatchew Haile married Misrak Amare only July 12, 1964, in Sidamo, and they collaborated on books together. They have four children, adopted two more, and have many grandchildren. Among his children is the material science professor Sossina M. Haile and the author Rebecca G. Haile. In 1974, while a member of the Ethiopian Parliament, Getatchew Haile opposed the Derg government. When government soldiers came to his home to arrest him, he was involved in a several day shootout and eventually shot and captured.

Bakersfield National Cemetery is a United States National Cemetery located at 30338 East Bear Mountain Blvd, Arvin, California, in Kern County. It is approximately east of Bakersfield. It is isolated from urban development by oak studded rolling hills in the Tehachapi Mountains. Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the cemetery has space to accommodate caskets and cremated remains on 500 acres (200 ha) of land.Bakersfield National Cemetery. US Department of Veterans Affairs. Accessed: 11-03-2011 History The history of the location of the cemetery dates back to the 1840s, when California was a part of Mexico. The land was granted by Mexican Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Jose Antonio Aguirre and Ignacio del Valle. They were the first recorded owners of the property. The land was primarily used for cattle ranching. During the 1850s and 1860s, General Edward Fitzgerald Beale purchased the land, and combined it with other property to form a large ranch. It was named Ranchos el Tejon, or The Tejon Ranch. In 1915, Bear Mountain Boulevard (SR 223) was constructed, replacing the dangerous White Wolf Road to the south. An important route, it linked the southern San Joaquin Valley, to Tehachapi and industries in the Mojave Desert. It was also a part of the Midway Route, which was one of two routes connecting Bakersfield with Los Angeles. It continued to serve that function until 1933, when Bena Road to the north was constructed, which provided a more direct connection to Bakersfield.McAllister, Melvin. The 'old roads' to Bakersfield. Tehachapi News. In 2003, congress adopted the National Cemetery Expansion Act. This authorized the creation of six new national cemeteries, including the Bakersfield National Cemetery. The Tejon Ranch Company offered land at multiple sites for the cemetery. Eventually, 500 acres of land adjacent to Bear Mountain Boulevard was selected. In 2007, architectural design contract was awarded to Huitt-Zollars, Inc, in Irvine, California. The cemetery opened in the summer of 2009, with a 20-acre (8.1 ha) early burial site and temporary facilities. Construction of the permanent facilities were completed two years later.

Life and career Bernhard (Bern√°t) Alexander was born Alexander M√°rkus in PestThe cities of Buda and Pest and the town of √ìbuda were merged as the city of Budapest in the fall of 1873. on 13 April 1850, and educated in his native city, later attending German universities, where he pursued studies in the fields of philosophy, aesthetics and pedagogy. On his return to Hungary he was appointed to a teaching post in a Realschule (scientifically oriented high school) in Budapest, and in 1878 was admitted as a docent into the faculty of philosophy at the University of Budapest, where he became a full professor in 1895. From 1892, he also lectured on dramaturgy and esthetics at the National Theater Academy, and on the latter subject and on the history of civilization at the Francis Joseph Polytechnic. He was a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and a member of the Kisfaludy Society, a major force in Hungarian literature. He was the father of Franz Alexander, a Hungarian- American psychoanalyst and physician, who is considered one of the founders of psychosomatic medicine and psychoanalytic criminology, and maternal grandfather of Alfr√©d R√©nyi, a Hungarian mathematician who made contributions in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory but mostly in probability theory. Works Alexander's chief works are A philosophia t√∂rt√©net√©nek eszm√©je, tekintettel a t√∂rt√©netre √°ltal√°ban (The idea of the history of philosophy, in consideration of history in general, 1878); Kant. √âlete, fejl≈ëd√©se √©s philosophi√°ja (Life, development and philosophy, 1881); A XIX. sz√°zad pesszimizmusa: Schopenhauer √©s Hartmann (The pessimism of the 19th century: Schopenhauer and Hartmann, Budapest, 1884, prize essay). Alexander, together with Professor J√≥zef B√°n√≥czi, later edited a seminal series of books on philosophers, the Filosofiai Ir√≥k T√°ra, for which he did translations and annotations of Ren√© Descartes, David Hume, and the Prolegomena to Immanuel Kant. Jointly with B√°n√≥czi, he translated Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. He was an active writer on matters of education, editing the pedagogical journal Magyar Tan√ºgy from 1882 to 1886. Exile and death However, Alexander became pariah in the nationalistic, anti-Semitic environment of post-1919 Hungary and Mikl√≥s Horthy's government, and spent four years abroad.

Murray McDavid is a bottler of Scotch whisky, offering a range from vintage single malts and grains to blended malts. History Murray McDavid was established in 1996 by Mark Reynier, Simon Coughlin, and Gordon Wright (who had previously been a director at Springbank Distillery). On 19 December 2000 Murray McDavid purchased the then-dormant Bruichladdich distillery and returned it to production. On 23 July 2012 it was announced that R√©my Cointreau UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the R√©my Cointreau Group had acquired Bruichladdich Distillery Company Limited with Murray McDavid as part of the acquisition. On 8 May 2013 it was announced that Murray McDavid had been sold to UK based Scotch whisky suppliers Aceo Limited, with director of Aceo Ltd, Edward Odim, saying \\"Our intention is to continue the legacy of Murray McDavid by staying true to its founders' vision and principles such as bottling carefully selected single malts without chill- filtering or adding colour and continuing and developing the tradition of ACE- ing our whiskies\\". ACE (Additional Cask Enhancement, a term coined at Murray McDavid), often referred to as 'wood finishing' or just 'finishing', is a process of maturing whiskies for a relatively brief period of time, following proper maturation, in selected casks that previously held wines or spirits other than the original casks. For example, a whisky can undergo a several- years' maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, after which it is transferred to an ex-wine (ex-sherry, ex-madeira, ex-rum, etc.) to enhance its flavour profile. Hence 'enhancement'. Murray McDavid is famous for a wide variety of casks that they use for this additional maturation, including some grand cru wines, rums, sherry, etc. More recently, they have been using, among others, fresh, first- fill ex-bourbon casks to 'enhance' (or finish) their whiskies, notably from the Koval Distillery in Chicago.  Murray McDavid products  Murray McDavid mature, select and bottle six main lines of whiskies. These include: Mission Gold - the rarest, oldest and exceptional single malt whiskies, Benchmark - the core range of mature single malts, Mystery Malt - single malt whiskies whose provenance is no more than vaguely hinted at, to puzzle and entertain a curious whisky buff, Select Grain - a range of single grain whiskies, The Vatting - blended malt whiskies (vatting of two or more single malt whiskies), Crafted Blend - blended whiskies (vatting of single malt and single grain whiskies). Murray McDavid is currently based at the disused Coleburn Distillery in the Scotch whisky-producing region of Speyside, where a lot of its casked whiskies mature under bond in a traditional, dunnage warehouse. Murray McDavid whiskies are released in strictly limited editions, often single-cask.

Located in different cantons, Einsiedeln Abbey and Fahr Convent form a double monastery, overseen by the male Abbot of Einsiedeln, no converse arrangement appears to be available for the Abbess of Fahr. Fahr and Einsiedeln may be one of the last of such arrangements to survive. In fact, there is such an arrangement in England at the Orthodox monastery of Tolleshunt Knights. Outside frescos on the convent church Refectory the former chaplain's house built in 1703 St. Anna chapel View of the convent from the Limmat  Geographical and administratively special situation  Historically the convent was located in an exclave of canton Aargau within the municipality of Unterengstringen in the canton of Z√ºrich in the Limmat Valley. The convent had not been part of a political municipality, although some administrative tasks have been carried out by the W√ºrenlos authorities since the 19th century and the nuns were always allowed to fulfill their political rights (voting, etc.) in W√ºrenlos. Since 1 January 2008 Fahr Convent has been a part of W√ºrenlos.The convent has its own postal code, 8109 Kloster Fahr.  History  The convent is first mentioned in AD 1130 as Vare (an old term used for \\"ferry\\"). The lands were donated by the House of Regensberg. On 22 January 1130 L√ºtold II and his son L√ºtold III and his wife Judenta handed over lands and estates on the shore of the Limmat around Weiningen and Unterengstringen-Oberengstringen to the Einsiedeln Abbey to establish a Benedictine convent. The Chapel of St. Nicholas already stood on the land. This may have been connected with the death of L√ºtold I in 1088 while engaged in battle against the forces of the Abbey of Einsiedeln. The convent was dedicated to Our Lady. In addition to the medieval St. Nikolaus- Kapelle (Saint Nicholas chapel), built around 10th century AD and now called St. Anna-Kapelle, and the late medieval church of the convent, the parish church of Weiningen were subordinated to the convent. From the very beginning, the convent has been overseen by the Abbot of Einsiedeln; the nuns are led in their daily life by a prioress appointed by the abbot. The bailiwick rights were first held by the Regensberg family, after 1306 by the citizens of the municipality of Z√ºrich, and from 1434 to 1798 by the Meyer von Knonau family. Around 1530 the convent was suppressed during the Reformation in Z√ºrich, but it reopened in 1576. An era of prosperity during the 17th century led to a brisk program of construction: In 1678 the tavern Zu den zwei Raben (\\"Two Ravens\\", the emblem of Einsiedeln Abbey) was built; from 1685 to 1696 the cloister and church tower were renovated; in 1703/04 a new refectory was designed by Johann Moosbrugger; and a house for the chaplain was erected in 1730/34. From 1743 to 1746 the convent church was decorated with frescoes by the Torricelli brothers. In dissolving the old County (Grafschaft) of Baden in 1803, the cantons of Zurich and Aargau established an exclave of Aargau within the canton of Z√ºrich, for the former lands of the convent. Formerly part of the Bishopric of Constance, the convent has been part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel since 1828. The canton of Aargau chose in 1841 to close all monasteries within its territory, but this was reversed in 1843 for convents. The negotiations between Einsiedeln Abbey and the cantonal authorities regarding assets and authority were completed nearly 90 years later, in 1932. At that point Aargau granted full autonomy to the conventual community. During World War II, from November 1943 to February 1944, 11 female Jewish refugees lived secretly in the cloister; unfortunately they had to leave for an unknown destination when the school was opened. On 1 February 1944, the convent established a B√§uerinnenschule, i.e. an agricultural school for women. On 1 January 2008 the convent was incorporated into the municipality of W√ºrenlos, happening over a century after the municipality's initial attempts to absorb the 1.48-hectare area of the convent. On 22 January 2009 the former Abbot of Einsiedeln, Dom Martin Werlen, O.S.B., presented the nuns with a new community seal, thereby indicating that the nuns were in full control of the business affairs of their convent. In 2014 the women's agricultural school (B√§uerinnenschule) had to close for financial reasons. At the same time an overall renovation of the convent buildings, erected between 1689 and 1746 was undertaken. The interiors, windows and antiquated power supply were refurbished in 2016 to finally comply with fire prevention and other modern statutory requirements.  Cloister  As of April 2010, there were 26 nuns (7 in 1873, 33 in 2000) living at the convent. Silja Walter (Sister Maria Hedwig, O.S.B.) (1919‚Äì2011), a renowned novelist, was the most prominent member of the community. On 23 April 2016 the Silja-Walter-Raum was inaugurated. Sister Maria Hedwig's literary work is inextricably linked to the convent as she lived for over 60 years in the same Benedictine community. During this time, Silja Walter wrote most of her work which included lyrics, mystery plays and theatre. After the renovation, the former office of the provost with its beautiful stucco ceiling was chosen to establish a small museum. It contains numerous texts, film, audio and photographic documents, as well as excerpts from the radio interview from 1982, when Silja Walter and her brother, Otto F. Walter, another renowned Swiss writer, recorded the interview tape Eine Insel (An Island). But also personal objects like the nun's typewriter are exhibited, and also the lesser known drawings and painting of the artist. The monastery would appeal to people who knew the artist's work, but also for the younger generation, said Prioress Irene during an interview. For now, the room will be open every last Sunday of the month after the worship service from approximately 10:45 to 14:00. Admission is free. On the feast day of Saint Wiborada ‚Äì the first (Swiss) woman to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church ‚Äì 2 May 2016, a two month pilgrimage began from Wiborada's native St. Gallen to Rome made up of eight female town residents and seven Fahr sisters, as part of a Catholic gender equality campaign, Kirche mit*. Along their journey to the Vatican, this group of pilgrims was accompanied in stages by other women's rights activists. By mid-May 2016 around 650 people (approximately one fifth men) joined for at least one day's stage, and there are 400 more registrations for the final section of the pilgrimage in Rome. Whether the Pope will grant an audience to the group of pilgrims on 2 July, the day of the Visitation, was uncertain; actually he then should be on vacation.  Cloister garden  Sister Beatrice Beerli (born 1947) and head of horticulture, had responsibility for the multi-award-winning convent gardens for over 20 years. Since the closure of the school in July 2013, she passed on her knowledge to occasional group tours.  Current Activities  For centuries viticulture had an important role in convent life. Even in the deed of donation of 22 January 1130, a vineyard was itemised. In the Middle Ages its cultivation and trade in wine was significant and frequently documented. Cultivation and wine production are part of the historic tradition, and the present vineyards comprise 4.2 hectares on \\"Wingert\\" hill just above the convent in the canton of Z√ºrich and on convent property in Weiningen where a range of grape varieties are grown . The well-known wine estate is managed by the nuns and around 30 external employees. Other agricultural products are made in the convent including liquors and honey. The convent's renowned agricultural school for women (B√§uerinnenschule) established in 1944 had to close in 2015 for economic and staffing reasons.  Cultural Heritage  Kloster Fahr is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.

Among the Kyrgyz, the site has status as a mazar. The mausoleum looks similar to other monuments from the 14th century, with kufic script around the outside edge of the monument.  Background  The Kyrgyz epic hero Manas is said to have been buried in the Ala-Too mountains in Talas Province, in northwestern Kyrgyzstan. The mausoleum 12 km east of the town of Talas is believed to house his remains and is a popular destination for Kyrgyz travelers. Traditional Kyrgyz horsemanship games are held there every summer since 1995. An inscription on the mausoleum states, however, that it is dedicated to \\"...the most famous of women, Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the emir Abuka\\". Legend has it that Kanikey, Manas' widow, ordered this inscription in an effort to confuse her husband's enemies and prevent a defiling of his grave. Indeed, when archaeologists opened the tomb, they found the skeleton of a man who was about 2 m tall (6.5 feet), not the skeleton of a woman. Academics and experts took this to mean that Manas Ordo was indeed the tomb of the legendary warrior, and not of the princess mentioned in the tomb's outer inscription. While there are still skeptics that say that Manas was not buried in this mausoleum, the sight has nonetheless become a popular destination and an important spiritual sight in Kyrgyzstan.

Description  The codex contains entire of the New Testament, on 190 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in two columns per page, 41-52 lines per page, in very small letters. The letters are so minute as to require a magnifying glass. The manuscript was written by several different hands. It contains the Epistula ad Carpianum, Prolegomena, and the Eusebian Canon tables. The text is divided according to the (chapters) in Greek and Latin, whose numerals are given at the margin, and their (titles) at the top. There is also a division according to the Ammonian Sections, references to the Eusebian Canons at the end of Matthew. It contains lectionary markings, and subscriptions. There are many corrections were made in the margin. According to Scrivener \\"this copy has very appearance of having been made from a very ancient codex\\" (arrangement of the Beatitudes in Matthew 5 in single line, as also the genealogy in Luke 3). The order of books: Gospels, Acts, Catholic epistles, Pauline epistles (Hebrews precede 1 Timothy), and Apocalypse.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden included it to the textual family Kx. Kurt Aland placed it in Category V. According to Gregory it has good readings. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the textual family Kx in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20.  History  Scrivener and Gregory dated it to the 11th century. It is presently assigned by the INTF to the 14th century. The manuscript was acquired along with seven other manuscripts (556, 676, 677, 678, 679, 681, and 682) by the late Sir Thomas Phillips, at Middle Hill in Worcestershire. These manuscripts were in the property of Mr. Fitzroy Fenwick, then at Thirlestaine House in Cheltenham. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener (531) and Gregory (680). It was examined by Dean Burgon. The text of the Apocalypse was collated by Herman C.

A soldier of the Cape Regiment In 1786 Duke Charles Eugene of W√ºrttemberg concluded an agreement with the DEIC to furnish a regiment of 2000 men to the DEIC for the sum of 300 000 guilders. Any soldiers falling away would be replaced by new recruits on payment of an annual subsidy of 65 000 guilders. The barracks of the Cape Regiment in Cape Town As a result, eleven military units under the command of fifty officers were dispatched in 1787 to the Cape via Holland. When they reached their destination seven months later 143 of the recruits had died as a result of privations. Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart This exodus caused one of the first German poems on South Africa to be written: the Kaplied by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart. The ship's manifest. In 1791 most of these soldiers were sent on to India, where almost all of them died. A small group of thirteen non-commissioned officers and soldiers stayed on at the Cape and found a refuge there. Members of the regiment played a prominent part in the social life of the Cape during their stay. Certain expressions, like swaapstreek (a stupid or foolish prank), were perhaps permanently absorbed by the everyday language at this time. Among the officers were well-educated men, who had attended the military training school near Stuttgart with the German poet Friedrich Schiller and had been on friendly terms with him - men such as the doctor, Friedrich Ludwig Liesching, and the poet's brother-in-law, Karl van Wolzogen. Some of them, including Liesching, collected botanical and geological specimens. A reading circle was formed and literary works obtained from Germany. These men also formed an amateur theatrical company, which staged German plays. Several married Cape Town women. Their chaplain, Johann Friedrich Sp√∂nlin, effected an improvement in the school system of the Cape. Dr Friedrich Ludwig Liesching became the owner of the largest pharmacy and later was chief of medical services and the hospital in Cape Town. Captain Johannes Zorn held the position of first landdrost at the Cape, and built the imposing mansion Leeuwenhof, now the official residence of the Premier of the Western Cape. His garden, with its exotic plants and birds, was one of the sights of the town. Johannes M√ºller, a common soldier of the regiment, grew rich as a tavern owner, married a slave woman, and in 1817 returned to his fatherland.

It was built in the 1860s, but was disused from 1986 until it was reopened to carry the London Overground in 2010. The viaduct is owned by Transport for London. Since then it has carried East London Line services between Shoreditch High Street and Dalston. History=Initial operation It was built as the main part of the North London City Extension, providing a more direct link from the North London Railway to the City of London (the City) at Broad Street, next door to the site that became Liverpool Street station. Previously the North London Line's access from west of Dalston to the City was by a circuitous route via Hackney, Homerton, Bow and Stepney to Fenchurch Street. The extension, originally with three lines, shortened this considerably by providing a direct route from Dalston over the Kingsland Viaduct. It was authorised by the North London Railway Act of 22 July 1861. It is said to have cost ¬£1 million and displaced 4,500 people. The extension was accessed by a triangular junction, accessible from both the west and east directions on the North London Railway. Passenger traffic into Broad Street began on 1 November 1865, and was said to have doubled the number of passengers to 14 million in 1868. Initially, there were services at fifteen-minute intervals to both Hampstead and Bow. A fourth line was added to the extension in 1874. Broad Street originally had seven platforms, extended to eight in 1891 and nine in 1913. The lines were electrified with two conductor rails at 600 V DC, with services beginning on 1 October 1916, using Oerlikon rolling stock. However, only the western five platforms at Broad Street served electrified lines, the remaining lines being unelectrified. Electric services to Watford did not begin until 10 July 1922. Reopening Newly built Hoxton station (2010) on the viaduct Old tube trains reused as artists studios on the disused southern segment of the viaduct The last scheduled train over the viaduct was on 27 June 1986, after which the line and its remaining stations were all closed. After that there were proposals in 1993 to extend London Underground's East London Line along it from its Shoreditch terminus to Dalston Junction.\\"Moves to extend East London Line.\\" Building, 14 May 1993\\"East London Line - London Underground to seek consent.\\" Estates Gazette, 4 December 1993 The plan received the support of a public inquiry in 1994 and it was envisaged that the construction of the extension and the station itself would begin in 1996, to be completed by 1998. The project was finally approved by the Government in 1996\\"Final approval given for powers to construct East London Line northern extension.\\" Department of Transport, 16 January 1997 but a lack of funding forced the project to be delayed in 1997.\\"Where Tube axe falls.\\" The Times, 21 February 1997 However, in 2007 the London Overground was created, which included the North London Line (the North London railway to which the viaduct connects at Dalston), and the East London Line was transferred to the London Overground to be extended south and to the north to meet the North London Line. To do this it followed the 1993 route along the Kingsland Viaduct. Work was complete in 2010 and on 27 April 2010 the first services began along the viaduct for the first time in over two decades. To facilitate this the viaduct has been refurbished, and many bridges over roads replaced; a remnant of the brick viaduct between New Inn Yard and Holywell Lane was demolished to make way for a connecting concrete viaduct to the new bridge over Shoreditch High Street. The southern end of the viaduct, from the old Broad Street/Liverpool Street terminus and where the East London Line crosses onto the viaduct at Hollywell Lane, has been given over to development, including the Broadgate Tower. Stations There were four stations on and adjacent to the viaduct: * Dalston Junction was at the bottom of the incline to the north of the viaduct, at the apex of the triangular junction, actually below street level. * Haggerston, not to be confused with the earlier NLR station on a slightly different site * Shoreditch, straddling Old Street and parallel to Shoreditch High Street, not to be confused with the former (now closed) London Underground station of the same name, some distance to the east * Broad Street, at the southern end of the viaduct, which had suburban services throughout its existence, and limited main line services. As of 2010, the new stations on the extended viaduct, or adjacent, are; * A rebuilt Dalston Junction on the same site as before. * A rebuilt Haggerston station slightly to the north. * Hoxton, a completely new station, opposite the rear of the Geffrye museum. * Shoreditch High Street, a completely new station.

Emil Theodor Schreiner (26 November 1831 ‚Äì 15 November 1910) was a Norwegian philologist and educator. Biography Schreiner was born in Christiania (now called Oslo) in 1831. He was the son of merchant Peter Heinrich Schreiner (1794‚Äì1880) and Andrea Wiborg (1801‚Äì1882). His father migrated to Norway from Flensburg. Schreiner took his examen artium at Christiania Cathedral School in 1849, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.philol. degree in 1855. He studied in Berlin for one year and also worked as a teacher of the secondary school Nissens Latin- og Realskole. Schneiner started his own school in 1859, but sold it in 1862 to work for a year as a research fellow at the university. He wrote his only academic paper, Om Forholdet mellom rythmus og metrum, but it was not published until 1866, when Schreiner had returned to the school system. Schreiner worked at Christiania Cathedral School from 1863 to 1872. From 1870, he was acting principal while Frederik Ludvig Vibe was ill. In 1872, Schreiner was made the principal at Skien Latinskole a post he held until 1876. He was at Drammen Latinskole from 1877 to 1893 and Kristiania Cathedral School (the school had changed spelling) from 1894 to 1907. Schreiner wrote several textbooks for the school system. Latinsk Sprogl√¶re til Skolebrug was released in 1871, and issued in the third edition in 1885. It faced competition in its time from Johan Peter Weisse's grammar Latinsk Grammatik til Skolebrug, also released in 1871, but Weisse's book was considered too difficult for school students, and was outsold by Schreiner's book. Schreiner's Latinsk Vocabularium til Skolebrug was released in 1880, and issued in the sixth edition in 1936. Kortfattet latinsk Ordf√∏iningsl√¶re til Brug i Middelskolen only came in one edition, in 1881. In 1887, Schreiner published the Latin- Norwegian dictionary Latinsk Ordbog together with Jan Johanssen and Marius Nygaard, a book which is still in use‚Äîit has been updated and reissued, last in 1998. Schreiner was a Commander, Second Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. Despite having only worked one year at a university, as research fellow, Schreiner was also made a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1887. He was also invited to sit on the assessment committee for professor candidates at the university. In December 1875, he was a part of the majority of the committee which appointed Johan Peter Weisse as professor, in preference to Jan Johanssen. Schreiner married his cousin Gunhild Heiberg Wiborg (1848‚Äì1932) in November 1872, and he was the brother-in-law of Sophus Bugge. Another of his cousins was the father of Kristian Schreiner. Emil Schreiner died in November 1910 in Kristiania.

It entails that the propulsion system of whatever kind operate continuously with a steady acceleration, rather than the brief impulsive thrusts used by chemical rockets ‚Äî for the first half of the journey it constantly pushes the spacecraft towards its destination, and for the last half of the journey it constantly uses backthrust, so that the spaceship arrives at the destination at a standstill.See williamhaloupek.hubpages.com/hub/Calculations-for-science-fiction-writers- Space-travel-with-constant-acceleration-nonrelativistic for some example computations.  Constant-acceleration drives  Constant acceleration is notable for several reasons: * It is a fast form of travel. When ergonomics are considered, they are the fastest form of interplanetary and interstellar travel. * Constant acceleration creates its own artificial gravity to the benefit of passengers, who may thus be spared from having to deal with the effects of microgravity. However, constant acceleration is an inefficient use of fuel and energy, and is not used in existing spaceflight systems.  Constant thrust versus constant acceleration  Constant-thrust and constant- acceleration trajectories involve the spacecraft firing its engine in a prolonged constant burn. In the limiting case where the vehicle acceleration is high compared to the local gravitational acceleration, the orbit approaches a straight line. The spacecraft points straight toward the target (accounting for target motion), and remains accelerating constantly under high thrust until it reaches its target. If it is required that the spacecraft rendezvous with the target, rather than performing a flyby, then the spacecraft must flip its orientation halfway through the journey, and decelerate the rest of the way. In the constant-thrust trajectory,W. E. Moeckel, Trajectories with Constant Tangential Thrust in Central Gravitational Fields, Technical Report R-63, NASA Lewis Research Center, 1960 (accessed 26 March 2014) the vehicle's acceleration increases during thrusting period, since the fuel use means the vehicle mass decreases. If, instead of constant thrust, the vehicle has constant acceleration, the engine thrust must decrease during the trajectory.  Interstellar travel  This plot shows a ship capable of 1-g (10 m/s2 or about 1.0 ly/y2) \\"felt\\" or proper-accelerationEdwin F. Taylor & John Archibald Wheeler (1966 - first edition only) Spacetime Physics (W.H. Freeman, San Francisco) , Chapter 1, Exercise 51, pp. 97‚Äì98: \\"Clock paradox III\\" (pdf). can go far, except for the problem of accelerating on-board propellant. Over interstellar distances a spaceship using significant constant acceleration will approach the speed of light, so special relativity effects like time dilation (the difference in time flow between ship time and planetary time) become important.C. Lagoute and E. Davoust (1995) The interstellar traveler, Am. J. Phys. 63:221‚Äì227  Expressions for covered distance and elapsed time  How far one travels, experiencing constant acceleration, from the point of view of Earth as a function of the traveler's time is expressed by the coordinate distance x as a function of proper time œÑ at constant proper acceleration a. It is given by: Extract of page 242 (where g=a, c=1 and x0=x(0)) :x(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{c^2}{a} \\\\left(\\\\cosh \\\\frac{a \\\\ \\\\tau}{c} -1 \\\\right) , where c is the speed of light. Under the same circumstances, the time elapsed on Earth (the coordinate time) as a function of the traveler's time is given by: :t(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{c}{a} \\\\sinh \\\\frac{a \\\\ \\\\tau}{c} .  Feasibility  A major limiting factor for constant acceleration drives is having enough fuel. Constant acceleration won't be feasible unless the specific impulse for fuel (the fuel's fuel efficiency) becomes much higher. There are two broad categories for ways to solve this problem: one is higher efficiency fuel (the motor ship approach) and the other is drawing propulsion energy from the environment as the ship passes through it (the sailing ship approach). Two possibilities for the motor ship approach are nuclear and matter‚Äìantimatter based fuels. One possibility for the sailing ship approach is discovering something equivalent to the parallelogram of force between wind and water which allows sails to propel a sailing ship. Picking up fuel along the way ‚Äî the ramjet approach ‚Äî will lose efficiency as the space craft's speed increases relative to the planetary reference. This happens because the fuel must be accelerated to the spaceship's velocity before its energy can be extracted and that will cut the fuel efficiency dramatically. A related issue is drag. If the near light-speed space craft is interacting with matter or energy that is moving slowly in the planetary reference frame‚Äîsolar wind, magnetic fields, cosmic microwave background radiation‚Äîthis will cause drag which will bleed off a portion of the engine's acceleration. A second big issue facing ships using constant acceleration for interstellar travel is colliding with matter and radiation while en route. In mid-journey any matter the ship strikes will be impacting at near light speed, so the impact will be dramatic.  Interstellar traveling speeds  If a space ship is using constant acceleration over interstellar distances, it will approach the speed of light for the middle part of its journey when viewed from the planetary frame of reference. This means that the interesting effects of relativity will become important. The most important effect is that time will appear to pass at different rates in the ship frame and the planetary frame, and this means that the ship's speed and journey time will appear different in the two frames. = Planetary reference frame = From the planetary frame of reference, the ship's speed will appear to be limited by the speed of light ‚Äî it can approach the speed of light, but never reach it. If a ship is using 1 g constant acceleration, it will appear to get near the speed of light in about a year, and have traveled about half a light year in distance. For the middle of the journey the ship's speed will be roughly the speed of light, and it will slow down again to zero over a year at the end of the journey. As a rule of thumb, for a constant acceleration at 1 g (Earth gravity), the journey time; as measured on Earth, will be the distance in light years to the destination, plus 1 year. This rule of thumb will give answers that are slightly shorter than the exact calculated answer, but reasonably accurate. = Ship reference frame = Plot of velocity parameters and times on the horizontal axis, versus position on the vertical axis, for an accelerated twin roundtrip to a destination with ŒîxAB=10c2/Œ± ~10 lightyears away if Œ±~9.8 m/s2. From the frame of reference of those on the ship the acceleration will not change as the journey goes on. Instead the planetary reference frame will look more and more relativistic. This means that for voyagers on the ship the journey will appear to be much shorter than what planetary observers see. At a constant acceleration of 1 g, a rocket could travel the diameter of our galaxy in about 12 years ship time, and about 113,000 years planetary time. If the last half of the trip involves deceleration at 1 g, the trip would take about 24 years. If the trip is merely to the nearest star, with deceleration the last half of the way, it would take 3.6 years.Baez, UCR, \\"The relativistic rocket\\"  In fiction  Tau Zero, a hard science fiction novel by Poul Anderson, has a spaceship using a constant acceleration drive. The spacecraft of George O. Smith's Venus Equilateral stories are all constant acceleration ships. Normal acceleration is 1 g, but in \\"The External Triangle\\" it is mentioned that accelerations of up to 5 g are possible if the crew is drugged with gravanol to counteract the effects of the g-load. Spacecraft in Joe Haldeman's novel The Forever War make extensive use of constant acceleration; they require elaborate safety equipment to keep their occupants alive at high acceleration (up to 25 g), and accelerate at 1 g even when \\"at rest\\" to provide humans with a comfortable level of gravity. In the \\"Known Space\\" universe, constructed by Larry Niven, Earth uses constant acceleration drives in the form of Bussard ramjets to help colonize the nearest planetary systems. In the non-known space novel A World Out of Time, Jerome Branch Corbell (for himself), \\"takes\\" a ramjet to the Galactic Center and back in 150 years ships time (most of it in cold sleep), but 3 million years passes on Earth. In \\"The Sparrow\\", by Mary Doria Russell, interstellar travel is achieved by converting a small asteroid into a constant acceleration spacecraft. Force is applied by ion engines fed with material mined from the asteroid itself. In the Revelation Space series by Alastair Reynolds, interstellar commerce depends upon \\"lighthugger\\" starships which can accelerate indefinitely at 1 g. The effects of relativistic travel are an important plot point in several stories, informing the psychologies and politics of the lighthuggers' \\"ultranaut\\" crews for example. In the novel \\"2061: Odyssey Three\\" by Arthur C. Clarke, the spaceship Universe, using a muon-catalyzed fusion rocket, is capable of constant acceleration at 0.2 g under full thrust. The UET and Hidden Worlds spaceships of F.M. Busby's Rissa Kerguelen saga utilize a constant acceleration drive that can accelerate at 1 g or even a little more.

In 2007, the BUWC changed its name to the Canadian Baptists of Western Canada to better reflect its national identity and western focus. Key figures in CBWC history include: Tommy Douglas, a Baptist minister in Weyburn Saskatchewan and healthcare reforming politician, William Aberhart (Bible Bill), an Albertan radio personality and Albertan Premier. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker was also a Canadian Baptist. Key beliefs Key beliefs include: *Christian faith arises from choosing a personal relationship with Christ *The priesthood of all believers *Believers baptism, usually by full immersion, rather than infant baptism *There are two ordinances: baptism and communion *Separation of church and state *Voluntary association of churches *Commitment to evangelism and social justice They have ordained female pastors since 1959.

The Group takes dialogue into the public sphere through sponsorship of programs that celebrate diverse cultures in Montreal. History of the organization The Montreal Dialogue Group was founded in January 2003 by Nada Sefian, a Palestinian Muslim born in Lebanon and Ronit Yarosky, a Canadian-Israeli Jew. Before starting the Montreal Dialogue Group, Sefian and Yarosky worked as members of several groups in political activism for the Israel Palestinian conflict. However they found the groups to be inflexible and unable to lead a solution for Arabs and Jews. They left the activist groups and formed the Montreal chapter of Women in Black, a global anti-occupation lobby group that organized weekly anti- occupation \\"vigils\\" outside the Israel consulate in Montreal. Sefian and Yarosky found the groups to be unproductive and felt that a new approach was needed to bring the two communities together. In 2003 Sefian and Yarosky organized a talk by Diana Bhuttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer specializing in the Palestinian authority. Around the same time, Sefian was involved in simulating conversation with Jews in a drama therapy conflict resolution workshop at Concordia University. They were convinced of the power of dialogue and this led to the first meeting of Montreal Dialogue Group, in which Sefian, Yarosky, and two Israel-Canadian women participated and shared personal stories. At the second meeting, Yarosky, some fellow Jewish friends as well as Sefian's and some of her Palestinian and Arabic participated; the Arabic- Jewish dialogue began.Shaffer, Carolyn. \\"Arab/Muslim-Jewish Dialogue in Montreal.\\" (2006): 59‚Äì67. USC.edu The Montreal Dialogue Group was also encouraged by the principles and successes of the Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group in California. Mission statement The Montreal Dialogue Group brings Canadians of Palestinian, Israelis, Arabs, Muslims, Christians and Jewish identities together in dialogue; listening and sharing communal beliefs, histories and national narratives of each other's identities. Their goal is not to change people's political or religious views, but to build open communications and friendships within and between communities. Participants have common concern over the conflict effecting the Middle East and aim to overcome mistrust and divisiveness from the groups in Canada. The group organizes regular discussion groups and variety of activities through the year to promote peace and demonstrate ways to coexist.\\"Montreal Dialogue Group 2006‚Äì2007 Annual Report.\\" Montreal Dialogue Group, 20 June 2007. Dialoguegroup.org The Group's main focus is the Israel/Palestine political issues; the topic includes the one vs. two-state solution, the right of return and Zionism. The Group sometimes covers other topics, such as Jewish and Muslim beliefs and cultures. Current activities Public Dialogues: The Public dialogue program is held monthly from September to June. Each meeting starts with a presentation by a member of the group or a guest speaker. It focuses on specific theme each meeting; including politics, religions and cultures. Themes from the past years cover media bias, the right of return, suicide bombing, the peace process, the one vs. two-state solution, two shared religious ceremonies/meals and a Passover Seder. After the presentation, there is a question and commentary time, followed by time for small group discussion to focus on the theme of a more personal basis. For information about current activities visit their website.Dialoguegroup.org Past Events The Group organizes a wide variety of activities to bring members from different religious backgrounds into dialogue and to encourage them to learn about and accept other religious communities. Some past examples of public outreach include: Annual Peace Concert, the first of which, was held at Unitarian Church in May 2007. It was hosted by Jowi Taylor of CBC's \\"Global Village\\" and raised over $1.500. Fun-da-Mental Differences; Middle Eastern Comedy Night was held on November 15, 2006 at AMC Forum Comedy Next. It was presented by comics of Middle Eastern backgrounds; Wafik Nasralla, Rasul Somji, Phil Shuchat, Ryan Wilner, and Dave Merheje. They poked fun at how they have been stereotyped and discriminated because of their Arabic or Muslim background. They, ultimately, appealed that they were \\"normal\\" and could laugh like anyone else through the show.Brownstain, Bill. \\"Common ground, not battle ground.\\" The Gazette 2 November 2006. Dialoguegroup.org This event raised over $3,500. The Passover Seder was held in April 2005. It was mainly organized by Nada Sefian, Ronit Yarosky, Camela Aigen and Dina Saikali from the Group. In this event, passages from the Torah, the Bible and the Koran was read in order to demonstrate that the three monotheistic religions share a lot in common. Sheila McDonough, a professor of religious studies at Concordia University, was invited to the event as the guest speaker to discuss the rules of Moses and the pharaohs in the Koran. This event was designed to acknowledge similarities among the three religions and help to build harmony between people from different backgrounds.Jayoush, Kinda. \\"Passover time to celebrate differences\\" The Gazette 23 April 2005. Dialoguegroup.org The Group planned a summer trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories in 2005 in which the group would meet with local peace group and activists in both communities. However, the trip was not carried out because they were not able to accept enough participants; for many the cost was unaffordable. Organization Structure The Group consists of the Annual General Assembly and the Board of Directors. The board members are elected at the General Assembly.\\"Montreal Dialogue Group Bylaws.\\" Montreal Dialogue Group, June 2007. Dialoguegroup.org In 2007, the group reduced the number of board member from nine to seven. Any individual who shares the goal and philosophy of the group can be a member of the Group. The group is always open to new members because the group leaders' policy is to try to involve as many people as possible into the dialogue to share the knowledge and experiences and to create a popular movement for peace and coexistence. The group started with forty members in 2003 and it has grown to about 30 to 50 attending members at the dialogue sessions and about 50 paid members. Its mailing list includes around 300 people.

The character and Thomas' casting was announced alongside that of the Barton family in May 2009. Thomas called Adam \\"a family man\\". The character first appeared during the episode broadcast on 17 July 2009. Following a break to participate in I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2016, Thomas opted to leave the serial and Adam's departure was announced on 22 June 2017, with his exit airing on 2 January 2018. Adam's storylines have included: his bromance with Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller); suffering a breakdown and committing arson following the death of his father, John Barton (James Thornton); discovering his uncle, James Barton (Bill Ward), is actually his biological father; his on-off marriage to Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins); believing he fathered Johnny Woodfield after a one-night stand with Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick); his fertility issues which prevent him having a child with Victoria; and admitting to killing Emma Barton (Gillian Kearney) to protect his mother Moira (Natalie J. Robb), who had actually killed her. Storylines Towards the end of 2009, Holly Barton (Sophie Powles) starts flirting with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) and it looks as though a relationship is brewing. At first, Adam isn't keen but comes round, making friends with Aaron. When Aaron suddenly starts playing hard to get with Holly, Adam questions it but Aaron says it's all part of the plan. However, everything slots into place when the boys and Holly go on a \\"lads\\" night out. When Aaron and Adam are on their way back, they are involved in a car crash and Aaron cuts his head. As Adam is checking it out, Aaron leans in for a kiss. Adam is horrified and pulls away, questioning Aaron's sexuality, but Aaron convinces him that it's all in his head. Not completely convinced, he tells Holly after realising that she has slept with Aaron but his parents insist he drops it when Holly, refusing to believe Adam, gets annoyed with him. Aaron watches jealously as Adam gets closer to Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey- Beth Crossley) and starts dating her. In early 2010, Adam is still convinced that Aaron is gay but leaves Aaron alone as he learns that Hannah is being bullied, but is confused about why Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins) did it. When sheep on the Bartons' farm start being stillborn, John knows something is wrong but doesn't know what. When Carl King's (Tom Lister) children, Thomas (Jack Ferguson) and Anya (Ceryen Dean), are hospitalised, Jai (Chris Bisson) and Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) are blamed but tests clear them and Adam remembers moving some toxic barrels a few months back and is shocked to discover he's responsible. When he confesses to his parents, John goes mad but realises that they have to admit responsibility. They are fined by Nathan Wylde (Lyndon Ogbourne) for the clean up so John stops Adam's wages until the bill is paid. In April, Adam witnesses Aaron kissing his secret boyfriend, Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock), but tells Aaron that he'll still be his mate, regardless of his sexuality, and keep his relationship secret. On his birthday, Adam and others at The Woolpack see Aaron punch Jackson, after Aaron thinks he's flirting with him in public, resulting in Aaron being arrested. When released, Aaron decides he can no longer risk people finding out he's gay and attempts suicide in the garage. When Adam and Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) discover him, they save him but Aaron reveals that he wishes he had died. Adam and his whole family struggle to come to terms with his sister Holly's addiction to heroin. He takes her to see Jackson who, after a horrific accident, has lost his ability to walk, Adam tries to show Holly that, she (unlike Jackson) can choose to get better and has made herself ill. The message doesn't sink in and Aaron is annoyed with Adam for using Jackson to get this message across to his sister. Scarlett notices that Adam has less and less time for her, ignoring her phone calls and text messages. This decline in their relationship culminates in Adam kissing Mia Macey (Sapphire Elia) on New Year's Eve. Devastated by this, Scarlett leaves for a holiday in Canada. Adam tries to pursue Mia, although she plays hard to get. They later start a relationship although Adam ruins this when he starts an affair with Mia's mother, Ella (Corrinne Wicks). She is furious when she finds out the truth and leaves the village. Adam is understandably distraught when he learns of his mother's affair with Cain, but he is delighted when John and Moira patch things up and they get back together. When John and Moira spend the night in a hotel, Adam is stunned to receive a phone call from Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), informing him that John and Moira have been in a car accident. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Adam watches in horror as the doctors declare his father dead. Adam falls to pieces after the death of John, blaming Cain for his death, believing that if Cain had not seduced Moira, his parents would have never split and had to go on the romantic break, resulting in John's death. Adam then set fire to the Dingle Automotors Garage, trapping Cain inside, then saving him. Adam confides in Aaron. Seeing Adam's pain at the grieving of John, Aaron tells the police he started the fire. Missing court, Adam helps Aaron escape to France with Ed Roberts (Lloyd Everitt). In August 2014, Adam is shocked as Aaron returns two years later and is ready to cover for Adam, following recent events of the fire at the garage. Aaron confesses to arson, but Adam later clears his name and spends a while in prison. During his time there, Adam suffers a beating, but recovers in hospital and is later released from prison. Adam and Aaron set up a small scrapyard business nearby. Emma Barton sabotages them early on and things nearly end in tears when Aaron is hardly attending work, but the two friends continue to make it work. In March 2015, Adam proposes to Victoria Sugden on her 21st birthday. Victoria accepts, but later admits that she is not ready for marriage and lets Adam down, leading to the pair breaking up. Adam sleeps with Vanessa Woodfield, who later becomes pregnant, but the father is unknown. Eventually, results reveal that Adam is the father, when really the actual father of Vanessa's baby is Kirin Kotecha. Adam and Victoria elope to get married, following Victoria's accidental knock down of Ashley Thomas, who is hospitalized and diagnosed with epilepsy. Adam and Victoria marry on the day of Victoria's court hearing and she is given a caution for accidentally running Ashley over. In late July 2015, Adam and Victoria return from their honeymoon and focus on their life as a married couple, but it is interrupted by the existence of Adam's unborn child, as it is still believed that Adam is the father. Adam fails to arrive at Vanessa's scan, which angers her and she makes the decision to leave Emmerdale because she does not want Adam involved in the upbringing of Vanessa's baby. In August 2015, Adam considers him and Victoria leaving instead to start a new life, but Victoria thinks Adam is mad thinking of leaving. Adam gets grief from Rhona Goskirk and he gets drunk, rather than attend the wedding of Pete Barton and Debbie Dingle. Adam falls asleep in a car at the scrapyard, but is unaware that a fire had been started, which then caused some gas canisters to explode and collide with a helicopter, which then crashed through the roof of the Village Hall. Adam wakes up in the car and Robert and Chrissie got him out before the car exploded. In January 2016, Vanessa takes another DNA test to see if Adam really is the father of Johnny (Vanessa's baby), after she finds a birthmark which the midwife says that it is perfectly normal for a mixed race baby to have. The DNA test reveals that Kirin is actually the father. When Vanessa breaks the news to Adam, he is devastated and attacks Kirin's father after he learns that it was him that switched the DNA results. Vanessa gives Adam some time alone with Johnny, but Adam takes off with him and hides in a hotel. Victoria talks Adam into returning Johnny to Vanessa before it gets serious. In February 2016, after learning that Aaron had been repeatedly raped at the hands of his father when he was younger, Adam is livid and offers to help Cain deal with Aaron's dad. After Aaron returns from giving evidence at the police station he hugs him and apologises for not being there for him. In March 2016, Adam left shocked to found out that Holly returned to the village after 4 years away. A month later, Adam supports Aaron through the court case where Gordon is found guilty and sent to prison. A few weeks later, Adam celebrates with the rest of the family when Aaron gets his deed poll letter officially declaring him as a Dingle. In September 2016, Adam is heartbroken by the sudden loss of his sister Holly, who died from a heroin overdose. He and Victoria move back to Butlers to support Moira. On the day of the funeral, Adam is angry and upset that his sister Hannah is unable to attend and comforts Moira as they say their final goodbyes to Holly. The following week, Adam helps Robert to pulls Aaron out following a motorway collision and Adam went to ambulance with Aaron who later survive. Later, on the same day, he is devastated when James dies as a result of the same accident. On the day of James' funeral, Adam tries to put a brave face on everything, insisting to Moira that he has already buried his dad. However, when Ashley interrupts the service Adam gets upset and asks Laurel to take her husband out, saying he's ruining his dad's funeral. Adam is surprised to learn that James has left him an equal share in his will much to Ross' displeasure. They clash over the issue and Adam admits he wasn't going to take it but changes his mind and decides to accept it. Adam fights with Ross after he learns that he tried it on with Victoria. Vic tries to break them up but ends up getting hurt. She is taken to the hospital where she tells a shocked Adam she might be pregnant. The test comes back negative but Vic confides in Finn that she wants a baby and she's not sure how Adam feels. Later at Butlers, Vic tells Adam she wants a baby and Adam concedes that if that's what she wants then they will start trying. The next day, Adam confides to Aaron his doubts about starting a family after his experience with Johnny. Aaron assures Adam he's already proven he'll be a great dad and offers to babysit for him anytime. Later, Ross apologises to Vic and Adam for his earlier behaviour and they call a truce. Adam tells Moira that he and Vic are trying to start a family and she is delighted. In February 2017, Adam helps the Sugdens and the Dingles organise Robert and Aaron's impromptu wedding. The next day, Adam is gutted when his best friend is sent to prison for 12 months on a GBH charge. However he is released two months later much to Adam's joy. Casting In May 2009, it was announced that Emmerdale's new series producer, Gavin Blyth, would introduce The Bartons, a new farming family, as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show. The family, which comprises five members - mother, father, two daughters and a son - took over the running of Butler's Farm. Of the family, Blyth said \\"I don't want to make Emmerdale a show about teenagers and young people, it's about family values. The Bartons are sexy, modern and contemporary. They're almost happy - and in soapland that's quite strange!\\" Natalie J. Robb and James Thornton were cast in the roles of parents, John and Moira. Sophie Powles and Grace Cassidy were cast their daughters, Holly and Hannah respectively. Jake Roche auditioned for the role of Adam, however, it was actor Adam Thomas who was eventually cast. Speaking of his casting, Thomas said that \\"Adam's a family man... Whatever his dad says, he does. The whole family is really close. Even with his sisters, he's the middle child but he wants to be the older brother and look after them all.\\"  Development = Departure  In March 2017, it was reported that Thomas had decided to leave Emmerdale after appearing in reality TV competition, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, although the actor denied the reports. However, on 22 June 2017, it was announced that Thomas had opted to leave the serial after eight years in the role. Adam's final scenes were broadcast in early 2018. Thomas called the decision to leave \\"tough\\", but cited his reasons for leaving as wanting to try new roles. He added that he had enjoyed working at Emmerdale and thanked the team for providing him with the role of Adam and for creating \\"some great storylines\\" for the character. The show's series producer, Iain MacLeod, revealed that Thomas had alerted show bosses far in advance so they were able to create a \\"huge\\" departure storyline for him, which MacLeod is looking forward to. He also commented, \\"Everyone will be really gutted to see Adam go! [...] It will be [sad] to wave goodbye to such a brilliant character and cast member.\\" Reception For his portrayal of Adam, Thomas won Best Soap Newcomer at the 2010 TV Choice Awards.

The U.S. government officer interviewing the band members described them as \\"astute, well-informed, and resourceful.\\" The Yellow Dogs played their first 'aboveground' (legal) concert at the Peyote club in Istanbul in January 2010. Two days later, they flew to New York City. Their second 'aboveground' concert was at the Cameo Gallery, in Brooklyn, New York. They later played Santos Party House and the Delancey in New York, and they played the Wave in Austin, Texas as part of the SXSW festival. They played the 92nd St. Y Tribeca in Manhattan at an afterparty for the U.S. opening of No One Knows About Persian Cats. Another band, also from Tehran, was also on the bill for this concert, Hypernova. Koory and Looloosh were part of the original line-up of Hypernova. But they did not leave Iran when other Hypernova members departed for the United States. On April 13, 2010 Milan Records released the No One Knows About Persian Cats motion picture soundtrack. The Yellow Dogs track \\"New Century\\" is included in the motion picture soundtrack, and bassist Koory appears on the CD cover and on the movie poster. IFC Films released the movie on demand on April 14, 2010, and in theaters two days later. November 2013 shooting On November 11, 2013, a shooting took place in Brooklyn that involved Yellow Dogs band members. According to band manager Ali Salehezadeh, guitarist Soroush Farazmand and drummer Arash Farazmand, along with Ali Eskandarian, a musician friend who was not part of the band, were all shot dead by a 29-year-old disgruntled musician, Ali Akbar Mohammed Rafie (also known as Raefe Akhbar). Another man present at the crime scene, Sasan Sadeghpourosko (age 25), survived, suffering only wounds to his arm. Rafie committed suicide. Originally, media reports described Akbar as a former band member who had been thrown out of the band three days before. In later reports, however, it was stated that he had never been an official member of the Yellow Dogs, but had hung out with Yellow Dogs since being expelled in 2012 from a different Iranian emigre rock band, Free Keys.

He won the 1977 Prix Renaudot for Les Combattants du petit bonheur. Boudard's 1995 novel Dying childhood was awarded and recognised by the French Academy with a Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Biography Boudard was born in Paris, an illegitimate child. He was brought up first by an adoptive family in the Loiret region of the center of France, then by his grand mother in the south of Paris. Boudard had a late career. As a teenager he was living in a country occupied by the German Army. He was wounded fighting for the French and he was awarded a military medal. His early adult life was spent in casual work, periods in jail and in a sanatorium recovering from tuberculosis. He experimented with writing, but it was not until he was 33 that he decided to be a full-time writer. He credits the writer Albert Paraz with inspiring this move. His novels are characterised by the colloquial terms and slang that Boudard used to describe life in the 1940s. His works are autobiographical and he uses his periods in a sanatorium and in jail as a basis for his stories. His 1963 novel The Cherry and his 1972 story The Hospital are examples, as is his 1992 novel The amazing Mr Joseph which tells the story of a French spy who becomes a millionaire dealing on the black market during World War II (based on the real career of Joseph Joanovici). Many of Boudard novels were adapted for French films and television. Boudard died in Nice on January 14, 2000.

In it she reported on her anthropological fieldwork among the Lele people on the western bank of the Kasai River in the Basongo area of what had at the time been south-western Belgian Congo. The ending of Belgian colonial rule in 1960 was one of the factors that brought her to abandon the usual practice in anthropological field reports of writing in the present tense . The book describes the social, economic and religious life of a large Lele village. Contents The first chapter, The Lele on the Map, indicates the location of Lele territory, the neighbouring peoples, and the relations between them. The second chapter, entitled The Productive Side of the Economy, considers the resources available to the Lele, and their exploitation of them through hunting, fishing, slash and burn agriculture, and craftsmanship, primarily the production of raffia cloth. The third chapter, Distribution of Wealth, describes how durable and perishable goods are distributed in accordance with status, payment of fees and dues, and exchange through trade and barter. The fourth chapter, The Village: Offices and Age-Sets, sets out how the division of a village by age sets cross-cuts and counterbalances division by kinship. The fifth chapter, Clans, describes the social functions of matrilineal clans spread out over a number of villages. The sixth chapter, Marriage: I. The Private Wife and Private Family, discusses the polygynous system of household marriage, concentrating control of marriageable women in the hands of older men, the special status accorded to fathers and grandfathers, the social obligations of sons-in-law, notions of sexual pollution, and mother-daughter relationships. The seventh chapter, Marriage: II. The Communal Village-Wife and Communal Family, considers a system of polyandry, outlawed by the Belgian colonial authorities, to provide a \\"village wife\\" as a communal resource for otherwise unmarried men. While this was regarded by missionaries as little better than a form of prostitution, Douglas describes the honour attendant on being \\"married to the village\\". The eighth chapter, Blood Debts, outlines forms of compensation paid to clans for deaths of clan members held to have been caused by sorcery or sex pollution. The ninth chapter, The Village: as Creditor and Debtor, considers the village as a \\"corporate personality\\", able to make and settle claims. Deaths by violence were a matter for the village, rather than the clan, to settle or avenge. The tenth chapter, The Role of the Aristocratic Clan in Relations between Villages, sets out inter-village rivalries, \\"dominated by the idea of wiping out insults and injuries by killing men or capturing women\\", before discussing the role of the aristocratic Tundu clan, who claimed a sort of ritual ascendancy over the Lele as a whole but had no special political paramountcy. Chapter eleven, Religious Sanctions on Village Unity and the Organization of Village Cults, describes belief in a single god, \\"Njambi\\", whose action in the world is mediated by various spiritual beings; ritual (sexual) segregations and taboos; the village cults of \\"begetters\\" and of diviners, membership of which imparted spiritual authority and occult knowledge. Her analysis of the most senior of these, the Pangolin cult (reserved to those who had engendered a male and a female child with the same wife, among other restrictions), became a byword for Mary Douglas's ethnographic insight.Richard Fardon, Mary Douglas: An Intellectual Biography (Routledge, 1999), pp. 70, 209. The twelfth chapter, Sorcery, describes the Lele conception of the sorcerer as a skilled diviner, and the efforts of diviners to direct accusations of occult harm towards breaches of ritual purity, the spirits of the dead, sorcerers from other villages, and those who had left the village. Chapter thirteen, Control of Sorcery, describes the two traditional methods of combatting sorcery: the \\"poison ordeal\\" (outlawed by the Belgian colonial authorities in 1924, so that \\"by 1950 the institution seemed to have disappeared from Lele life\\", p. 241), and the \\"messianic\\" anti-sorcery cults that periodically swept through the villages, wiping the slates of past sorcery accusations clean. The final chapter, European Impact on Lele Society, describes the effects of colonial administration, the international cash economy, and missionary preaching. Editions The first edition was published for the International African Institute by Oxford University Press in 1963.

They are a consequence of the concern of investors and regulators in the inadequate transparency, independence, and governance in the industry. They are guidelines to be followed by sovereign wealth fund management to maintain a stable global financial system, proper controls around risk, regulation and a sound governance structure As of 2016 30 funds have formally signed up to the Principles and joined the IFSWF representing collectively 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally or US$5.5 trillion. The principles are maintained and promoted by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and whose membership have to either have implemented or aspire to implement the principles.  History  In 2008, there was growing concern by investors and regulators about SWFs, partially about visibility, accountably and the governance structure of them. To address these concerns, a joint effort between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the \\"International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds\\" (IWG-SWF) which represented the coming together of 14 principle funds including some of the largest, such as GIC Private Limited and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The IWG-SWF then drafted the 24 Santiago Principles, to set out common international standards regarding transparency, independence, and governance which SWFs might follow. These were made public after being presented to the IMF International Monetary Financial Committee on 11 October 2008. The working group was then replaced by a permanent body on the 6 April 2009, the \\"International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds\\" to maintain and promote the new standards going forward and encourage other sovereign wealth fund to sign up. Overview According to the IFSWF, the creation of the Santiago Principles was driven by the following goals for SWFs: * To help maintain a stable global financial system and free flow of capital and investment; * To comply with all applicable regulatory and disclosure requirements in the countries in which they invest; * To ensure that SWFs invest on the basis of economic and financial risk and return- related considerations; and * To ensure that SWFs have in place a transparent and sound governance structure that provides adequate operational controls, risk management, and accountability. 24 principles The Santiago Principles state that SWFs need to have the following: # A sound legal framework, # A well-defined mission, # Domestic activities coordinated with fiscal and monetary authorities, # Clearly defined rules for drawdowns, # Transparency to the owner, # Clear division of roles, # Governing bodies appointed in a predetermined manner, # Governing bodies that act in the best interest of the SWF, # Independence, # Formal definition of accountability, # Annual reporting, # Independent auditors, # Ethics and professionalism, # Rules-based outsourcing, # Ability to abide by rules of foreign countries, # Operational independence from the owner, # Public transparency, # Clear investment policies, # Commercial orientation, # Restrictions against using privileged information, # Shareholder rights policies, # Effective risk management, # Proper reporting of performance, # And regular reviews to ensure its compliance with the foregoing Santiago Principles.

With access to dogs of many breeds, he aimed to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him during his collections, which took him through many dangerous, bandit-infested areas. He set out to breed a new type of dog that, in his opinion, would be the perfect combination of strength, loyalty, intelligence, and ferocity. Later, Otto Goeller and Philip Gruening continued to develop the breed to become the dog that is seen today. After Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann- pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the \\"pinscher\\" on the grounds that this German word for terrier was no longer appropriate.

Although consensus was reached, the treaty was never ratified. Background The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of Azerbaijan SSR which started in early 1988 had developed unmitigated and claimed lives of many civilians, interior troops and army. Mediating mission With consent from the authorities in Azerbaijan and Armenia, Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev led a mediating mission on September 20‚Äì23 visiting Baku, Ganja, Stepanakert (Khankendi) and Yerevan. Taking the principles of territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign states, observance of civil rights as the starting point, breakthrough was achieved on September 22 when Armenia renounced all its claims to Azerbaijani territory. This allowed the parties to agree to a joint communique the next day, committing both sides to disarm and withdraw militias, allow return of refugees and IDPs, re-establish Soviet-era administrative order of the Nagorno-Karabakh oblast and set up delegations to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Soviet army and internal troops would still remain in the conflict zone and the process would be supervised by Russian and Kazakh officials. The peace communiqu√© was discussed with participation of Y. Shaposhnikov, V.Barannikov, S. Voskanyan, M. Gezalov, V. Dzhafarov, R. Kocharian, L. Petrosian, M.

Biography  Born in Lyon, he was the son of engineer Eugene Locard. He was a student at √âcole Centrale Paris. He is considered one of the more prolific malacologists of the so-called \\"new school\\" with Jules Ren√© Bourguignat (1828‚Äì1892) as his master. Locard is credited with describing hundreds of zoological species, in particular freshwater mussels and gastropods from the genus Helix. During his career he did very little collecting of specimens himself, preferring to work in an institution/museum environment. In 1895, he revised the conchological collection of Jacques Philippe Raymond Draparnaud (1772‚Äì1804). Among his many publications are articles on the geology of the Lyon region, and treatises on fossil and living mollusks. He was the author of detailed biographies of naturalists, such as Martial √âtienne Mulsant (1797‚Äì1880) and Gaspard Michaud (1795‚Äì1880), and also wrote an article on Lyonnaise malacologists, titled Malacologistes lyonnais (1879).Google Books M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts....

Its common name comes from where it is found, Hudson Bay. Identification right  Adult  The Hudsonian whiteface has a length of . Male dragonflies are black and marked with red on the thorax and the abdomen. The elongated spots on the abdomen are possibly pointed on one end, this forms a line along the length of the top side of the abdomen. The female is a dark brownish color and marked similarly to the male except the markings are yellow instead of black. Both sexes have creamy white faces. Naiad The naiad of the Hudsonian whiteface has a length of . Its abdomen is rounded, which gives it a short, stocky appearance known as the sprawler form. Naiads are brown with three dark stripes marking the length below the abdomen. In some cases, there are tiny hooks on abdominal segments three through six. Every side of abdominal segments eight and nine has a spine that points out away from the abdomen. Distribution The Hudsonian whiteface is found in an area stretching from Alaska to Labrador and from the Hudson Bay to northern West Virginia. Habitat Hudsonian whitefaces are usually found at vegetated ponds, sloughs, sand-bottom lakes, bogs, and fens. The bogs are at higher elevations. Flight season These dragonflies have a flight season to early May to late August. Diet= Adult  These dragonflies will feed on almost any soft-bodied flying insect such as mosquitoes, flies, butterflies, moths, mayflies, and flying ants or termites. Naiad The naiad of the Hudsonian whiteface has a wide variety diet. They feed on aquatic insects, such as mosquito larvae, other aquatic fly larvae, mayfly larvae, and freshwater shrimp. They sometimes eat small fish and tadpoles. Ecology The naiads of these dragonflies live in submerged vegetation. They do not actively pursue prey but wait for it to pass by. This strategy affords them protection from other predators. Naiads change to adults at night. Many records of this species is sparse, adults are believed to fly from late May to mid-August. They also fly at different times. The hunting occurs from the shoreline vegetation, where this species perches. Many specimen from Idaho tend to be larger than those found further north in its region. Hudsonian whitefaces have been known to swarm over sphagnum bogs in the northern part of its range. Reproduction After mating, a male guards a female to prevent other males from mating with her. He does this by flying above her while she laying her eggs. It drives away other potential mates or maybe dragonflies of other species. The female lays her eggs by dipping the tip of her abdomen in the water while hovering above the surface. Similar species Hudsonian whitefaces are similar to Sympetrum species in appearance and behavior in some cases. Species within this genus are similar-looking and change in appearance as they age. Conservation Populations of this species are widespread, abundant, and secure.

Among the passengers were the French diplomatic couriers Paul Longuet and Frederic Marty and US courier Henry Antheil from the US embassy in Helsinki. The Soviet Union had declared an embargo on Estonia on 9 June 1940, and the Soviet air force was ordered to prevent Estonian or Latvian air force flights to Finland or Sweden. Various theories for the shootdown have been presented, one being that the Soviet Union wanted to get hold of the diplomatic mail that was transported in the aircraft, and subsequently picked up by a Soviet submarine which was operating in the area at the time of the downing.1940 Junkers Ju52-3/mge shot down Junkers Ju 52/3m in flight 7 November 1941: An Aero Junkers Ju 52-3/mce aircraft equipped with floats made an emergency landing in the sea after all three engines had failed due to problems with fuel quality.

It is controversial, since the unpredictable nature of firearm wounds could result in the wound failing to incapacitate, accidentally killing or missing the target, the latter of which presents a risk of unintended casualties. Limbs are one main area often targeted when shooting to wound. However, limbs are smaller and can be moved faster and more radically than the torso, so the option of shooting to wound is generally viewed with skepticism by law enforcement in the United States.

It documents Spahr's search to locate and thank the listeners who wrote letters to her great-grandmother reporting details of her grandfather's capture and internment in a German prison camp in 1943. Discovery Spahr's discovery of what she first took to be a box of love letters in trunk belonging to her late grandfather inspired her to investigate who wrote them and why. She found more than 70 letters written to her great- grandmother Martha in 1943 by individuals in different parts of U.S. Each one advised Martha that her son Robert had been captured during the Tunisia Campaign and was being held by the Germans as a prisoner of war. The letters often included personal reassurances from the writer, such as \\"don't worry\\" and \\"he's in good health\\", and some passed along requests for items from home, such as toothbrushes and underwear. Subsequent investigation showed they were written by shortwave radio listeners who'd tuned in to Axis propaganda broadcasts that disseminated details of recently captured prisoners. Inspired by the apparent compassion of the writers and the unique service they felt compelled to provide to families of war prisoners, she undertook to try to locate and thank any she could find who were still living. An internet search of names and addresses contained on the letters resulted in a number of possible leads. Spahr sent letters of gratitude to approximately 75 of these and received about a dozen responses. She was able to make subsequent contact with several of the individuals, and developed close friendships with a few of them. Listeners During World War II, short messages from prisoners of war were often read by studio announcers at stations in Germany, Japan, and other Axis powers countries. A number of shortwave listeners copied the prisoner names and addresses and notified families by mail or telephone, and the practice became known as ‚ÄúPrisoner of War relay‚Äù or ‚ÄúPOW monitoring\\". Although the Allied government provided similar services, the families usually heard from shortwave listeners first, sometimes as many as 100 at a time. Many wartime listeners were ordinary citizens who discovered they were able access the shortwave bands; a feature included on many premium consumer radios of the era. Times and radio frequencies of the news from Rome, Berlin and Tokyo were published daily on the radio page of The New York Times. Others were dedicated shortwave listeners or DXers who maintained an ongoing interest in long- distance radio listening as a hobby. Still others were licensed amateur radio operators who were, as a group, banned from transmitting due to wartime restrictions, but often kept their listening gear in operation. Some of the reports they provided were casual. Spahr documents a letter from Edward D. Rapier of New Orleans, Louisiana who wrote that he accidentally tuned into a German broadcast and heard about Robert Spahr‚Äôs status. Others appeared more urgent. Mrs. Earl Seigle of Tyler, Texas sent a letter to Martha Spahr by airmail special delivery. Seigle noted the radio announcer's reading of a message from Robert Spahr: ‚ÄúI arrived safe in Germany as a prisoner. I will write later.‚Äù Others like Irwin F. Bender of Oberlin, Pennsylvania asked for the donation of a postage stamp so that he might continue to provide other families the same service. Sometimes letters got misrouted, and Martha Spahr once received news of a soldier named James C. Caraway. Many listeners like Herman Winkler of New York City were so dedicated to their practice they created letter templates to speed up the process. Flavius Jankauskas, age 16, with his shortwave receiver in 1942. Some of these belonged to clubs such as ‚ÄúSWAM‚Äù, the Short-Wave Amateur Monitors Club, a group of listeners organized by Mrs. Ruby Yant of Lima, Ohio. Yant assigned each member a specific night of the week to monitor so that no messages would be missed. A copy of a SWAM newsletter containing a membership list, and a SWAM postcard invitation to membership, both reproduced in the book, indicate that the group was formed in 1943 and had around 50 members in 1944. Some of the SWAM monitors approached their job with enthusiasm. Although not typical, at least two SWAM members were responsible for sending 3,000 letters each. Another, according to Spahr, sent over 5,000. One SWAM member, Flavius Jankauskas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was only 16 years old when he sent his letter to Spahr's family. The next year he joined the war effort by enlisting in the United States Merchant Marine. On meeting Jankauskas, Spahr reports that he remains a ham radio enthusiast holding the callsign K3JA, and still listens to shortwave broadcasts as a hobby. They developed a close friendship, culminating with Jankauskas presenting Spahr with the shortwave radio receiver he used during the war as a gift. Controversy The practice of monitoring POW broadcasts sometimes provoked the U.S. government to react strongly against individual listeners. Spahr documents a number of cases, among them, John R. Fike, of Omaha, Nebraska. Fike sent a letter to Martha Spahr on May 9, 1943. Shortly after, the FBI investigated Fike's shortwave radio listening and accused him of being a German spy. His name was eventually cleared before his death in 1988. Listening to enemy broadcasters was widely viewed with suspicion by the government, and Spahr cites a 1943 American Legion Magazine article which sought to discourage reliance on news contained in enemy broadcasts, saying that the POW broadcasts were seen as merely bait in the Axis propaganda war, intended to weaken the morale and the ‚Äúwill to fight‚Äù of relatives and friends of missing men. By 1943, government officials were reportedly ‚Äúincreasingly concerned‚Äù over citizen POW monitoring. A New York Times article stated the activity was ‚Äúplaying directly into the hands of the country‚Äôs enemies‚Äù by building up an audience for the propaganda broadcasts. It went on to say that since there was no assurance of the information‚Äôs accuracy, the shortwave listeners might cause \\"needless disappointment and heartache.‚Äù The American Red Cross reported that hundreds of families had received ‚Äúfalse casualty reports,‚Äù and that enemy news of prisoners should be ignored. It quoted the FBI as saying ‚ÄúThe spreading of such reports indicated a substantial force of enemy representatives strategically placed throughout the country, working under enemy orders to undermine American morale.‚Äù ReferencesExternal links * World War II Radio Heroes: Letters of Compassion * World War II Prisoner's of War * Short Wave Listening Information * Amateur Radio History Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:History books about World War II Category:World War II prisoners of war ","title":"World War II Radio Heroes"},{"id":"26958649","text":"Margaret W. Rossiter (born July 1944) is an American historian of science, and Marie Underhill Noll Professor of the History of Science, at Cornell University. Rossiter coined the term Matilda effect for the systematic suppression of information about women in the history of science, and the denial of the contribution of women scientists in research, whose work is often attributed to their male colleagues. Early life and education Margaret Rossiter and her twin brother Charles were born into a military family at the end of the Second World War.\\"Writing Women into Science\\", Writing and revising the disciplines, Editor Jonathan Monroe, Cornell University Press, 2002, The family eventually settled in Massachusetts near Boston, first in Malden and then Melrose. Rossiter first discovered the history of science as a high school student, when she says she was more interested in the stories of the scientists than the actual experiments because \\"in lab sections we could rarely get the actual experiments to come out 'right.'\\" Eventually Rossiter became a National Merit Scholar and in 1962 went to Radcliffe to study Mathematics. Instead, she switched majors to chemistry and then history of science, ultimately graduating in 1966. While studying at Radcliffe she developed an interest in the history of American science, a field that was just beginning to be explored. After graduating from Radcliffe, Rossiter spent the summer working for the Smithsonian before going on to do a master's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After earning her M.A. she moved on to the history of science department at Yale where she continued her interest in American scientific history and earned a second M.Phil. She completed her PhD at Yale in 1971, working on the topics of agricultural science and American scientists in Germany. Emergence of agricultural science Rossiter published The Emergence of Agricultural Science, Justus Liebig and the Americans 1840-1880, with Yale University Press in 1975. Comments were made by several reviewers: The text is limited to mini- biographies of Eben Horsford, John Pitkin Norton, and Samuel William Johnson and is lacking study of economic impact and of regions beyond the states of New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, particularly of the South.James R. Shortridge (1978) Journal of Historical Geography 4(1) It shows \\"structural emphasis on Liebig's influence\\". It shortchanges Johnson's development of physical characteristics of soils and plant physiology.Mary Hargreaves (1977) New York History 01/1977 \\"A very substantial addition to our knowledge of sciences in America\\", but \\"reminds us how badly we need parallel studies of this sophistication for the plant sciences.\\"Nathan Reingold (1976) History of Medicine and Allied Sciences \\"A trim, scholarly work that satisfies without satiating.\\"John J. Beer (1976) Technology and Culture Exhibits \\"penny-pinching at Harvard and spectacular philanthropy at Yale.\\"Stanley L. Becker (1976) BioScience 26(12) It is lacking \\"social analysis of who was pushing for agricultural reform\\", and omits coverage of social changes of the period.Morris Berman (1977) Isis 68(4) \\"Omission of all but a passing reference to Evan Pugh seems strange... He was at least as important as Horsford, and more successful.\\"W. V. Ferrar (1976) The British Journal for the History of Science 9(1) Career and academic contributions While studying at Yale, Rossiter once asked at the weekly informal gathering of her departments' professors and students, \\"were there ever women scientists\\", she received an \\"authoritative\\" reply that: 'no, there were not, any such women who could be considered were just working for a male scientist.' Upon graduation she received a fellowship at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard. During her fellowship at the Charles Warren Center, Rossiter began to focus on the history of women in American science. She uncovered hundreds of such women when, in preparation for a postdoctoral study of 20th Century American science, she delved into the reference work American Men of Science (now called American Men and Women of Science). Hidden inside were the biographies of 500 women scientists. This discovery spurred her Charles Warren Center fellowship talk, Women scientists in America before 1920 which she published in the magazine American Scientist after it was rejected by Science and Scientific American. The paper's success led her to continue her research in the area, despite a lukewarm reception from both the scientific and historical communities. She took a visiting professor position at UC Berkeley where she prepared her dissertation for publication, and then she turned her attention to a new book on women scientists. Despite being told by some women scientists that \\"there was nothing to study,\\" Rossiter found a wealth of information. This abundance of sources allowed her plans for a single book to grow into a three volume project. At the time Rossiter had still been unable to procure a tenure-track position, and was working mostly off grants. In 1981 she received the Guggenheim Fellowship which allowed her to continue her work. She published her first volume, Women Scientists in America, Struggles and Strategies to 1940, with Johns Hopkins University Press in 1982. The book was well received, including positive reviews in The New York Times, Nature, and Science. After the publication of the first volume, Rossiter was asked to run the NSF's program on the History and Philosophy of Science while its director took a year of leave during 1982‚Äì1983. In 1983‚Äì1984 she was a visiting professor at Harvard, where she continued work on her second volume. Still unable to find a tenure-track position, she applied for the NSF's Visiting Professorships for Women program, and received a one-year appointment to Cornell, which she stretched to two years (1986‚Äì1988). Cornell agreed to keep her on for another three years, but her funding was split between three departments including women's studies, agriculture, and history. In many ways, at this stage of her career she felt like some of the women she wrote about, saying \\"I guess I am like a 78 [rpm] record in a 33 world\\". While still at Cornell, in 1989, she became a MacArthur Fellow. However, despite significant public and faculty pressure, the university refused to hire her, stating that she could not be given an appointment because she was not in any department. It was not until she received an offer of a tenured position with a substantial research budget from the University of Georgia that Cornell's administration decided to keep her, creating an endowed chair for her and putting together funding to start the History of Science department. Secure at Cornell, Rossiter was able to complete the research for her second volume, Women Scientists in America: Before Affirmative Action, 1940-1972. It was published through Johns Hopkins in 1995. This second volume examines barriers to women's full participation as working scientists from World War II to 1972. One such barrier was anti-nepotism rules at many colleges and universities. These forbade married men and women to both hold tenured positions. Rossiter cites many examples, but a particularly striking case was that of mathematician Josephine Mitchell. When Mitchell was a tenured associate professor at the University of Illinois in the 1950s, she married an untenured member of the math department. As a result, she was asked to leave her position, although her new husband retained his. The second volume was also well received, winning the History of Women in Science Prize and the Pfizer Prize. The History of Women in Science Prize was subsequently named after Rossiter. In 1994 she took on editorship of Isis, the official journal of the History of Science Society, which she continued until 2003. She has also continued teaching courses on agriculture, women in science and the history of science at Cornell. Rossiter completed her trilogy on Women Scientists in America with the publication, in 2012 of Women Scientists in American Volume 3: Forging a New World Since 1972. This last volume describes dozens of women who became advocates for the advancement of women in science after the passage of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, carrying to the present the story of Women in American Science. Rossiter's work has been especially significant as a framework for other scholars to build on. Not only in the English speaking world. Thus, Carmen Magall√≥n acknowledges that it was the work of Margaret Rossiter what inspired her to research the experience of the Spanish Women pioneers in the sciences.Carmen Magall√≥n: Pioneras espa√±olas en las ciencias, Madrid, CSIC, 2004: http://editorial.csic.es/publicaciones/libros/11110/978-84-00-07773-0/pioneras- espanolas-en-las-ciencias-las-mujeres-del.html In the early 1980s Margaret Rossiter offered two concepts for understanding the mass of statistics on women in science and the disadvantages women continued to suffer. The first she called hierarchical segregation, the well-known phenomenon that as one moves up the ladder of power and prestige fewer female faces are to be seen. This notion is perhaps more useful than that of the glass ceiling, the supposedly invisible barrier that keeps women from rising to the top because the notion of hierarchical disparities draws attention to the multiple stages at which women drop off as they attempt to climb academic or industrial ladders. The second concept she offered was \\"territorial segregation\\", how women cluster in scientific disciplines. The most striking example of occupational territoriality used to be that women stayed at home and men went out to work.

The monument to Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca in the plaza (Joan Figueras Vila, 1878). Teatro Espa√±ol, the oldest theater in Madrid, is located on the plaza's east side. It was built in seventeenth century and then had the name Corral del Pr√≠ncipe. On the west side of the plaza, a luxury hotel (now ME Madrid Reina Victoria) was built in the early nineteenth century. The hotel achieved fame for being the favorite among the most popular bullfighters. For example, the regular guest Manolete always reserved room number 220 in superstition . Another interesting fact is that the hotel NH Vantas, close to Plaza de Toros in Madrid, has its own room 220 usually booked by the famous painter Xavier Morard. . The plaza is a popular meeting point in Madrid. History The name derives from a monastery with the name Santa Ana that occupied the current location in the seventeenth century. The origins of the modern plaza go back to Joseph I, who in 1810, with urban sanitation of Madrid in mind, demolished the old Carmelite monastery and the adjoining houses. The plaza began to take its current appearance, which was almost completed in 1880 when buildings that obstructed the view of the Teatro Espa√±ol was demolished.

A door on each side of the fuselage provides access to the seating area; in addition an escape hatch is provided above the two forward seats, to be used if fuselage deformation in a crash prevents those doors from being operable. The Rotax engine cylinder heads are liquid-cooled; there are cooling vanes on the cylinder barrels. Thus both cooling airflow through the nacelle, and a cooling radiator, are required in each cowl. The electric starters, used to start the engines on the ground, must also be used for an inflight restart, since the highly geared engines\\"The . . engine spins as high as 5800 rpm, but a gear box reduces the . . propeller . . to neary 2400 rpm.\\" (Flying) cannot be turned by airflow past the stopped propeller. Thus, for FAA certification, the company was required to add a backup battery in addition to the standard battery. The pilot's power quadrant contains three controls for each engine: throttle, propeller rpm, and carburetor heat. The engines have automatic mixture adjustment, so there is no mixture control required on the panel.Flying The link between the flight controls and the flight surfaces is by pushrod, rather than the usual cables.

It first broadcast on BBC One on 15 May 2010. It was written by sitcom writer Simon Nye and directed by Catherine Morshead. In the episode, the Eleventh Doctor, a time travelling alien played by Matt Smith, and his human travelling companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), are in a trap set by the mysterious \\"Dream Lord\\" (Toby Jones), wherein they repeatedly fall asleep and wake up in a different reality. In one, Amy and Rory are happily married but pursued by elderly people possessed by aliens, while in another they are on board the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, where they anticipate being frozen to death by a nearby astronomical phenomenon. They must decide which is the real reality and die in the dream, to wake up in reality and escape the trap. At the episode's conclusion, the Dream Lord is ultimately revealed to be a manifestation of the Doctor's dark side and self-loathing. Nye wrote the episode to explore and to test Amy's relationships with both the Doctor and Rory. Showrunner Steven Moffat suggested that Nye, a comedy writer by trade, build the episode around a split dream concept, and encouraged Nye to create a \\"monster\\" for the episode, which influenced his writing of the retirement home dream. The dream scenes in Amy and Rory's village was filmed in Skenfrith, Wales and used CGI and prosthetics. \\"Amy's Choice\\" was seen by 7.55 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. The most positive critic reviews praised the episode's surrealism and commended it as one of the year's strongest scripts, but other reviewers felt the episode's horror or monsters unsatisfying. Plot=Synopsis The Eleventh Doctor, Amy and Rory find themselves flickering between two realities, falling asleep at the sound of birdsong in one and waking in the other. In the first reality, Amy and Rory stopped travelling with the Doctor five years previously, and are happily married in Leadworth, expecting their first child. They are chased by the Eknodine, an alien race that have disguised themselves as the elderly of the town. In the other reality, they are trapped in a powerless TARDIS, drifting towards a freezing cold star which will kill them. During one of their experiences in the TARDIS-reality they are met by the \\"Dream Lord\\", an apparition who tells them that he has created a dream reality in contrast to their actual reality. The three must determine which is the dream reality and kill themselves in it to return to the other reality. However, if they choose wrong they will be killed in both. The Dream Lord keeps Amy awake in the TARDIS reality while the Doctor and Rory fall asleep and return to the Leadworth reality. The Dream Lord questions Amy as to whom she would choose between Rory and the Doctor. He states that she must choose between the worlds; one leads to a peaceful married life with Rory while the other leads to adventure and excitement with the Doctor. Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her house from the Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor-caravan. An Eknodine kills Rory. Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth reality is false. Amy and the Doctor drive the motor-caravan into the house. The three wake up again on the TARDIS which the Dream Lord reactivates. After the Dream Lord's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self-destruct. The three wake up again on the TARDIS, no longer in any danger. The Doctor realises both realities were false since the Dream Lord had no power over the real world and was a manifestation of his darker side. The three were influenced by psychic pollen that had fallen in the TARDIS time rotor and heated up, creating the Dream Lord and the false realities. Rory comes to realise that Amy killed herself in the Leadworth reality out of love for him. Continuity The Dream Lord describes the Doctor sarcastically as \\"The Oncoming Storm\\", a name coined by his archenemies the Daleks, and first mentioned in the Seventh Doctor novel Love and War and subsequently on-screen in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", where it was attributed to the Daleks. He also says to the Doctor, \\"You're probably a vegetarian!\\" in a butcher's shop and calls him \\"veggie\\", referring to The Two Doctors (1985), in which the Sixth Doctor announced that he and Peri would eat a vegetarian diet from then on. The Dream Lord also teases the Doctor's relationship with Elizabeth I. This began in \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" where Elizabeth I wished to behead the Doctor and continued in \\"The End of Time\\", which alluded to the possibility the two were married. The marriage between the two was seen three years later in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". Production=Writing \\"Amy's Choice\\" was written by Simon Nye, who is known for writing the sitcom Men Behaving Badly. Nye attended read- throughs of previous episodes to capture the character and \\"voice\\" of the Doctor and Amy. Nye admitted to restraining himself in the change from comedy to science fiction, but said it was \\"fun\\" and \\"hugely liberating\\". Showrunner Steven Moffat originally gave Nye the premise of the episode for it to fit in the series arc, which was to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship. Nye states that Rory's \\"death\\" scene is essentially where Amy realises her feelings for Rory. Nye wanted to prove that Amy really loved Rory, and he was \\"not just a cypher boyfriend or fianc√©\\". Moffat suggested the idea of the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye to come up with a monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents. Filming and effects Skenfrith Castle, where some scenes were filmed \\"Amy's Choice\\" was the last episode of the fifth series to be filmed, and the editing finished the week it aired. The read-through for the episode took place on 17 February 2010 in the Upper Boat Studios along with the read- through for episode eleven, marking the final two read-throughs for the series. The dream sequences taking place in the fictional town of Upper Leadworth were filmed in Skenfrith, Wales. Karen Gillan had to wear a latex prosthetic stomach bump for the scenes which depicted Amy as pregnant. She claimed it made her feel more mature and act ridiculously, and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series. Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look \\"more masculine\\" and pulled back in a ponytail. The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it. Cast notes Nick Hobbs, who appeared as Mr Nainby in this episode, previously played Aggedor alongside Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor in the stories The Curse of Peladon and The Monster of Peladon. Hobbs has also previously appeared as a lorry driver in The Claws of Axos and operated the Wirrn prop for The Ark in Space. Broadcast and reception \\"Amy's Choice\\" was first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom on Saturday, 15 May 2010 from 6:25 p.m. to 7:10 p.m. In the United States it was shown on sister station BBC America on 5 June 2010. In the UK, preliminary overnight ratings for the episode totalled 6.2 million viewers; 5.9 million on BBC One and 0.3 million on BBC HD. Based on these estimated figures, viewership was about the same as the previous week. When final ratings were calculated, it was shown BBC One held 7.063 million viewers, the sixth most viewed programme for the week, and 485,000 viewers on BBC HD, the highest viewed programme of the week for that channel. This gave \\"Amy's Choice\\" final consolidated ratings of 7.55 million viewers. The episode was also given an Appreciation Index of 84. \\"Amy's Choice\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray format with the following episodes \\"The Hungry Earth\\" and \\"Cold Blood\\" on 2 August 2010. It was then re-released as part of the complete series five DVD on 8 November 2010. Critical reception Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was positive about the episode, calling it \\"probably the strongest all-round script we've had this year, chock full of good lines\\". He added, \\"The concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised, particularly the bizarre sight of them laying siege to Amy and Rory's cottage with household and gardening implements\\". He concluded that it \\"was one of those stories that you would only find in Doctor Who, and shows once again that the series can provide genuine thought-provoking, interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills\\". Matt Wales of IGN rated the episode 8.5 out of 10 and described it as \\"surreal, fantastical, intriguing, witty, emotional and, at times, genuinely unsettling\\". Unlike Martin, he said it was \\"impressive enough on pacing alone\\" and made a \\"brisk, refreshing 45-minute episode\\". However, he criticised the ending for being \\"glossed over so quickly\\" and found Upper Leadworth hard to believe. Keith Phipps, writing on The A.V. Club, graded the episode a B and stated it was \\"a solid ... entry in what's been a generally terrific season of Doctor Who\\". He praised Toby Jones' performance as the Dream Lord, saying that \\"in lesser hands, he might have come off as a copycat version of Star Trek Q, but Jones makes the part his own\\". However, he thought its weakness was the pace and \\"the retirement home-dwelling bad guys, who ultimately seem like a geriatric, and not that frightening, variation on the same old shambling zombies.\\" Daniel Martin, reviewing the episode for The Guardian, described it as \\"at least partially successful\\". He praised Karen Gillan's performance, saying that she \\"is capable of more than one-liners and physical comedy ‚Äì and brings something to your eye, too\\". However, he thought that the episode lacked ideas and storylines usually found in the show, and criticised the sitcom-style dialogue. Patrick Mulkern, writing for the Radio Times, was \\"distinctly underwhelmed\\", comparing it to \\"one of the more disappointing episodes of The Sarah Jane Adventures\\". He \\"particularly disliked the demonising of elderly people\\". Upon rewatching, however, although \\"previous gripes\\" remained, he did appreciate some the \\"more subdued\\" background music from Murray Gold, the script's \\"tight structure and several amusing lines\\", and \\"the realisation that, for the first time, the Doctor is travelling with a couple in love\\". SFX Magazine Jordan Farley gave the episode 3 and a half out of 5 stars, saying the direction \\"never quite [struck] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare\\" and the camera was \\"a little flat\\" with a strange angle. He was displeased with the discovery that it had all been a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror \\"never shock in the way you might expect\\". However, he praised Smith for being \\"on blindingly good form\\" while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were \\"fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history\\", and said Jones was \\"a lot of fun to watch\\" despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.

Biography He studied law, history, natural science, and art at Halle, Munich, Freiburg, and Berlin, and traveled extensively in Europe, Canada, and the United States 1846-1847. The end of his travels in the United States found him in Cincinnati where he remained for seven months. Here he held some public presentations on \\"the significance of the German people in world history.\\" Later he gathered these presentations together and published them as Geschichte und Zust√§nde der Deutschen in Amerika (History and condition of the Germans in America; Cincinnati, 1848). As it was the first time such a book had appeared in Ohio, it made its author very popular; one passage in the book is also a likely source of the Muhlenberg legend that German almost became the official language of the United States. He left for home 2 October 1847. On his return to Germany, he took an active part in the political uprising of 1848. He founded the Westph√§lische Zeitung, and was imprisoned by the government for political agitation, but was shortly afterward acquitted after a trial. In 1849 he became assessor of the court of appeal in Paderborn, and was afterward professor in the universities of Munich and G√∂ttingen.

Prelude  After the Dade Massacre, the Florida militia reached the Withlacoochee River, however an unexpected difficulty was found. The stream was deep and rapid, there was no bridge, and the only means of crossing was in a leaky canoe that would hold only four or five men. An effort was made to swim the horses over, but only two could be gotten across in that way. The crossing began at daylight, the regular soldiers going first, and at noon only 260 had crossed. They tried to make rafts, but there was no suitable wood. The men who could do so swam the river, and ammunition was carried over on a raft of tree logs.  Battle  The regulars and a few of the volunteers had crossed, when the Indians began a severe and unexpected fire. General Call, having made a footbridge of logs, was trying to get his men across as fast as possible when the attack began. He now left them with orders to cross as rapidly as they could, and crossed in the canoe himself while the fight was at the worst. As many of the volunteers as could do so crossed during the fight, thus preventing the Indians from getting between the regular troops and the river, and so cutting them off.

Leonard Brooks, Arthur Harold Stone, Cedric Smith, and W. T. Tutte. The four mathematicians met in 1935 as undergraduate students at Trinity College, Cambridge, where they joined the Trinity Mathematical Society and began meeting together to work on mathematical problems. Pseudonym The pseudonym originated by combining the initials of the mathematicians' given names (Bill, Leonard, Arthur, and Cedric) to form BLAC. This was extended to BLAnChe. The surname Descartes was chosen as a play on the common phrase carte blanche. Publication Over 30 works were published under the name, including whimsical poetry and mathematical humour, but some serious mathematical results as well. Many of these publications appeared in Eureka, a mathematical student magazine in Cambridge. Notably, the foursome proved several theorems in mathematical tessellation. In particular, they solved the problem of squaring the square, showing that a square can be divided into smaller squares, no two of which are the same. They also discovered \\"Blanche's Dissection\\", a method of dividing a square into rectangles of equal area but different dimensions. They modelled these using abstract electrical networks, an approach that yielded not only solutions to the original problem, but techniques with wider applications to the field of electrical networks. They published their results‚Äîunder their own names‚Äîin 1940. Tutte, who is believed to have contributed the most work under Descartes's name, kept up the pretence for years, refusing to acknowledge even in private that she was fictitious. \\"Descartes\\" also published on graph colouring, and Tutte used the pseudonym to publish the fourth known snark, now called the Descartes snark. She also published the poem \\"Hymne to Hymen\\" as a gift to Hector P√©tard (another fictitious mathematical personage) on the day of his wedding to Betti Bourbaki (daughter of Nicolas Bourbaki, yet another fictitious mathematical personage).

It was one of the four \\"snaglets\\" along with Crosseye, Flash, and Clickette that were released by Sausage Software that month. FrameGang used non-standard HTML tags which were meant to be used with Netscape, and thus not all browsers were able to use the frames created. FrameGang is no longer for sale by Sausage Software. Features FrameGang could handle multiple frames, allowed previewing and saving of the frames, and generated HTML code for the frames which could then be used in HotDog. FrameGang allowed for the development of frames without knowledge of html.In the FrameGang \\"fghelp\\" file in version 1a, it states \\"FrameGang shields you from having to know about frame HTML syntax.\\" under the 'Jargon Buster' section. The program was also accompanied with help features and tutorials on building frames. FrameGang was considered an \\"addon\\" to Sausage Software's popular HotDog Professional 2.0 which didn't have frame support. Reception FrameGang was well received and was recommended in PC/Computing magazine's list of \\"1,001 Top Free Internet Downloads\\" for 1997.

English translations of fangshi include alchemist, astrologer, diviner, exorcist, geomancer, doctor, magician, mountebank, monk, mystic, necromancer, occultist, omenologist, physician, physiognomist, technician, technologist, thaumaturge, and wizard. Word The Chinese word fangshi combines fang \\"direction; side; locality; place; region; formula; (medical) prescription; recipe; method; way\\" and shi \\"scholar; intelligentsia; gentleman; officer; yeoman; soldier; person trained in a certain field\\". Many English-language texts transliterate this word as fangshi (older texts use fangshih), but some literally translate it. *\\"gentlemen possessing magical recipes\\" (Needham 1956:134) *\\"recipe gentlemen\\" (Welch 1957:96) *\\"masters of recipes\\" (Harper 1986:394) *\\"'direction-scholar', that is, one versed in interpreting omens from their orientation\\" (Walters 1986:304) [from fengjiao \\"wind angle\\" divination below] *\\"Esoteric Masters\\" (Roth 1991:604) *\\"gentleman who possess techniques, technician\\" (Sivin 1995:27) *\\"masters of recipes and methods\\" (Sakade 2000:545) *\\"masters of methods\\" (Csikszentmihalyi 2008:406) *\\"masters of esoterica\\" (Campany 2009:33) The Chinese historian Yu Ying-shi (1965:105) concludes that \\"as a general term, fang-shih may be translated 'religious Taoists' or 'popular Taoists,' since all such arts were later incorporated in the Taoist religion. Only in specific cases depending on contexts, should the term be translated 'magicians,' 'alchemists,' or 'immortalists.'\\" Fangshi \\"is an elusive term that defies a consistent translation\\" (Toh 2010:4). There is general agreement that the shi in fangshi means \\"master; gentleman; trained specialist\\" (cf. Daoshi \\"Daoist priest; diviner\\"), but considerable disagreement about the meaning of fang. The etymology of fangshi is \\"subject to various interpretations\\", writes DeWoskin. > By the end of the Later Chou, there are several occurrences of the word > \\"fang\\" in two new binomes, fang-shu [] and fang-shuo [], literally, \\"fang > books\\" and \\"fang theories\\". The word \\"fang\\" in its various common contexts > meant \\"efficacious,\\" \\"formulaic,\\" \\"parallel,\\" \\"correlative,\\" \\"comparative,\\" > \\"medicinal,\\" \\"spiritual,\\" or \\"esoteric.\\" Throughout archaic times, the word > also occurs commonly in the compound ssu-fang [], meaning four outlying > areas, and hence refers to people, places, and cultures removed from the > central court. Each of these meanings is potentially a factor in the > etymology of the term.\\" (1983:1‚Äì2) Harper says \\"DeWoskin's attempt at a definition for fang shih which admits every possible meaning of fang into its analysis renders the term meaningless\\". > Whatever fang or shih as separate words meant in an earlier period, when > they were combined to form the name for wonder-workers who gathered at the > Ch'in and Han courts, the name expressed some essential quality of these > people. Automatically most of the meanings for fang which DeWoskin claims > are \\"potentially a factor in the etymology of the term\\" can be eliminated, > especially the series \\"parallel, correlative, comparative.\\" In analyzing the > term fang shih, earlier scholars have focused primarily on the meaning > \\"method\\" or \\"tablet on which a method is recorded, recipe,\\" in which case > fang shih means \\"master possessing methods\\" or \\"master possessing recipes.\\" > (1986:395) Based upon words that Han texts use to describe occult practices, fangshu \\"recipe book; treatise on an art/skill; collection of medical prescriptions\\" and fangban \\"recipe tablet; treatise on an art/skill\\", Harper concludes, \\"The possession of writings containing occult knowledge which might be revealed to select patrons was the chief characteristic of all who were known as fang shih.\\" Describing the background of fangshi, DeWoskin suggests an \\"other\\" etymology. > It is possible to group the antecedents of fang-shih thought and techniques > into three distinct areas: astrology and calendrics; the practices of wu > mediums and conjury; and pharmaceutical and hygienic medicine.

(1983:6) Harper also faults this hypothesis, concluding, \\"A more judicious examination could not lead to this sort of reductio ad absurdum.\\" Summarizing how Chinese authors used the word fangshi from the Han through the Song Dynasties, Sivin lists four general criteria. > #The fang-shih usually belonged to the tiny privileged segment of the > population who could read books and leave records.

(1995:28-9) History Fangshi are first recorded in early Chinese canonical Twenty-Four Histories: Sima Qian's (c. 91 BCE) Shiji Records of the Grand Historian, Ban Gu's (82 CE) Hanshu Book of Han, Chen Shou's (289 CE) Sanguozhi Records of Three Kingdoms, and Fan Ye's (445 CE) Houhanshu Book of Later Han. DeWoskin (1983) translated fangshi biographies from the latter three histories, but some reviewers (e.g., Boltz 1985 and Harper 1986) criticized him for ignoring Ngo's (1976) French translation of the same biographies. These historical texts document that during the late Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE), fangshi originated in northeastern China and specialized in xian \\"immortality; transcendence\\" techniques. During the Qin Dynasty (221‚Äì206 BCE) and Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), fangshi were patronized by emperors who sought the elixir of immortality. By the middle of the Six Dynasties Period (220‚Äì569 CE), the role of fangshi had declined and their techniques had been adapted into Daoist religion and traditional Chinese medicine. The word fangshi first appears in the Fengshan shu \\"Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices\\" of the \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\". This context concerns Qin Shi Huang (r. 221‚Äì210 BCE), the first Qin emperor traveling and performing sacrifices in the northeastern coastal states of Qi and Yan (present-day Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning). During the era of King Wei (r. c. 356‚Äì320 BCE) and King Xuan (r. 319‚Äì301 BCE) of Qi and King Zhao (r. 311‚Äì279 BCE) of Yan, fangshi claimed to have studied the techniques of Zou Yan, who systematized Yin-Yang and the Five Phases. > Song Wuji, Zhengbo Qiao, Chong Shang, Xianmen Gao, and Zui Hou were all men > of Yan who practiced magic and followed the way of the immortals, discarding > their mortal forms and changing into spiritual beings by means of > supernatural aid. Zou Yan won fame among the feudal lords for his theories > of the yin and yang and the succession of the five elements, but the [] > magicians who lived along the seacoast of Qi and Yan, though they claimed to > transmit his teachings, were unable to understand them. Thus from this time > there appeared a host of men, too numerous to mention, who expounded all > sorts of weird and fantastic theories and went to any lengths to flatter the > rulers of the day and to ingratiate themselves with them. (tr. Watson > 1996:14) Compare Welch's (1957:96) translation, \\"they practiced the Tao of recipes and immortality (fang hsien tao []). Their bodies were released, dissolved, and transformed. They relied on serving ghosts (kuei []) and spirits (shen []).\\" These early fangshi asserted to know of three divine mountains where the elixir of immortality existed, Penglai , Fangzhang , and Yingzhou in the Bohai Sea. > From the age of Kings Wei and Xuan of Qi and King Zhao of Yan, men were sent > from time to time to set out to sea and search for the islands of Penglai, > Fangzhang, and Yingzhou. These were three spirit mountains which were > supposed to exist in the Gulf of Bohai. They were not very far from the land > of men, it was said, but the difficulty was that, whenever a boat was about > to touch their shores, a wind would always spring up and drive it away. In > the past, people said, there had been men who succeeded in reaching them, > and found them peopled by fairy sprits who possessed the elixir of > immortality. All the plants and birds and animals of the islands were white, > and the palaces and gates were made of gold and silver. Seen from afar, the > three spirit mountains looked like clouds but, as one drew closer, they > seemed instead to be down under the water. In any event, as soon as anyone > got near to them, the wind would suddenly come and drag the boat away, so > that in the end no one could ever reach them. (tr. Watson 1996:14) The Shiji also records that the Qin emperor dispatched the fangshi Xu Fu to obtain the elixir of life from the xian Anqi Sheng, who lived on Mount Penglai in 219 BCE, and then sent Lu Sheng \\"Master Lu\\" in 215 BCE. The emperor subsequently dispatched three other fangshi expeditions to the spirit islands, but none returned to China. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141‚Äì87 BCE) lavishly patronized fangshi, writes DeWoskin (1985:378), \\"to such an extent that virtually anyone with a plausible 'secret tradition' rushed to court to collect his reward.\\" Emperor Wu's uncle and advisor Liu An (179‚Äì122 BCE, compiler of the Huainanzi) gathered \\"several thousand\\" fangshi and compiled their techniques of shenxian \\"spirit transcendence\\" and huangbai \\"alchemy \\". Two famous fangshi advised Emperor Wu to emulate the legendary Yellow Emperor's practices. The alchemist Li Shaojun attempted to recreate the Yellow Emperor's rite to transform cinnabar into gold. The architect Gongyu Dai claimed to have the Yellow Emperor's plans for a 12-story pentagonal hall, which Emperor Wu had rebuilt in 102 BCE. Csikszentmihalyi (2008:407‚Äì408) elucidates the fangshi category's chronological development by contrasting its place in these early Chinese histories. In the Records of the Grand Historian, \\"the methods (fang ) used by the fangshi generally concerned demons and spirits: methods for retreating from old age (quelao fang ), methods involving demons and gods (guishen fang ), and methods for gods, monsters and anomalies (shen guai qi fang ).\\" The Book of Later Han chapter on fangshi broadened the category to include omen and portent techniques such as fengjiao \\"wind angles\\". The Records of Three Kingdoms combined the Han historical categories of fangshi and shushu \\"numbers and arts\\" (divination and omenology) into a chapter on fangshu \\"methods and arts\\". \\"Thus, the fangshi, originally experts in matters of the spirits, came by the late Han to include the ubiquitous experts in detecting shifts in the balance of the natural world.\\" Fangshi originated in southern China. Sin was punished by ailments in the view of the Heavenly Masters. The Shangqing syncretized the Heavenly Masters with fangshi. Buddhism, Fangshi, and Heavenly Masters were synchronized in Lingbao. Buddhism, Celestial Masters and fangshi all contributed to the religious canon of Lingbao. Celestial Master petitions to divinities were copied by the canon of the Lingbao and fangshi rites were also copied by them. Techniques Fangshi employed numerous techniques, methods, and practices. DeWoskin (1983:22-29) lists forty-two mentioned in historical biographies of fangshi. Some are familiar (e.g., dunjia \\"Evading Stems; sexagenary cycle divination\\" and wuyi \\"Medium Healing; shamanic medicine\\"), while others are obscure. For instance, DeWoskin explains fengjiao \\"Wind Angles\\" divination. > Wind Angles (Feng-chiao): The wind from eight angles (four sides and four > corners) is observed for its direction, strength, and other qualities. ... > The nature of the analysis is still to be determined, but some sources link > the practice to expertise in the five tones (wu-yin), specifically the > ability to hear and differentiate pitches that are inaudible to most people. > (1983:27) Csikszentmihalyi (2008:408) clarifies fengjiao. \\"This practice, which may date back to the Shang dynasty, involves using the temperature, strength, and changes in direction in seasonal winds to determine the local increase and decrease in Yin and Yang qi.\\" The Yinqueshan Han Slips, discovered in 1972, contain manuscripts about fengjiao and nayin \\"Matching Sounds\\". Citing examples of the techniques named tuibu \\"astrology\\" and tingzhuan \\"cleromancy\\", Harper says \\"inaccuracy abounds\\" in DeWoskin's translations. > What is the reader to think, for example, when DeWoskin translates the term > t'ui pu as \\"astral influences\\" and explains that it relates to \\"projections > from sky readings\\" (p. 23)? A more literal rendering of t'ui pu would be > \\"plotting the paces\\" and the term refers primarily to determining the paths > of the sun, moon, and planets. T'ing chuan (\\"bamboo twisters\\" in DeWoskin's > translation) is identified as \\"a type of crack making\\" and DeWoskin gives > the following fuller description of the technique: \\"This technique is one of > a number of crack and fracture-reading approaches. Sections of bamboo are > broken and the resultant cracks are read\\" (p. 27). In fact, t'ing chuan > refers to a form of divination by lots, similar to divination with yarrow > stalks, in which the counters are slivers of broken bamboo or sometimes > twigs broken off plants. DeWoskin appears to have made up his own > explanation. His brief summations of other techniques are similarly > uninformative or inaccurate. (1986:396) Some fangshi practices like shefu \\"shoot cover\\" were closer to parlor magic than esoteric techniques. DeWoskin explains > The repertory by which fang-shih won their patronage included not only > storytelling, but glib dissertations on astrology, omenology, and esoteric > philosophy and various performances of magical arts. The histories record > many instances of a fang-shih challenge game, she-fu , where masters the > likes of Tung-fang Shuo, Kuan Lu , and Guo P'u (276‚Äì324) guessed the > identity of hidden objects before gatherings of dinner guests or skeptical > officials. (1985:379) Notable fangshi Many famous fangshi \\"method masters\\" are considered Daoists. *Xu Fu (fl. 219‚Äì210 BCE), sent by Qin Shi Huang to find elixir of immortality *Luan Da (d. 112 BCE), professed to know the secret to immortality *Gan Ji (c. 2nd century CE), Daoist priest *Zuo Ci (c. 3rd century CE), Daoist master, teacher of Ge Xuan *Ge Xuan (164‚Äì244), Daoist master, grandfather of Ge Hong *Guan Lu (209‚Äì256), famous diviner *Guo Pu (276‚Äì324), commentator and author *Ge Hong (283‚Äì343), Daoist author of the Baopuzi *Elder Zhang Guo , (c. mid 8th century), one of the Eight Immortals *Chen Tuan (c. 920‚Äì989), Daoist master, originator of Liuhebafa gungfu The term fangshi sometimes occurs in contemporary usage. For instance, Wong (1992) applies the fangshi tradition to explain the author Liu E and his (1904) novel the Travels of Lao Can. Connections The fangshi tradition has diverse origins and affiliations. When first recorded around the fourth century BCE, fangshi were connected with Zhou dynasty astrology, divination, and record-keeping. During the Qin and Han dynasties, fangshi developed many new techniques, which were gradually absorbed by Daoist religions (e.g., Shangqing School), Daoist movements (e.g., Way of the Five Pecks of Rice), Chinese alchemy (both internal Neidan and external Waidan), Buddhist meditation, and traditional Chinese medicine. \\"The genealogy of the fangshi is complex\\", Robinet (1997:37) writes. \\"They go back to the archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself; under the Shang and Zhou they were the only ones who knew divination and writing.\\" DeWoskin describes how the fangshi consolidated several ancient Chinese traditions. > Their divination practices can be traced back to late Shang-dynasty oracle- > bone culture, Chou-dynasty milfoil-stalk procedures, and Chou astrological > and calendric technology. This historical connection between divination > practices, especially calendric and astrological types, and the chronicling > of events is reflected in the conspicuous literacy of the fang-shih and > their propensity for authoring biographical, geographical, and other > narratives. Their medical practices combine elements of the Confucian > medical tradition (ju-i ) and popular medical practices, derived in large > part from shamanic ritual. Hence they practiced a range of therapies from > acupuncture and pharmacology to incantation and talismanic exorcism. Their > immortality practices encompass both alchemical (wai-tan ) and hygienic > (nei-tan ) techniques adumbrated in the Taoist classics and elaborated in > the emerging religious Taoist movements. (1985:379) Daoist religions appropriated many fangshi techniques. Holmes Welch hypothesized that Daoism was a river that united four streams of philosophy, hygiene, alchemy, and Penglai mythology. Fangshi are associated with the latter two. > It was probably between 350 and 250 B.C. that the names of Lao Tzu, Chuang > Tzu, and Lieh Tzu became associated with what we shall call \\"philosophical > Taoism\\"; their books testified in turn to the existence of a \\"hygiene > school,\\" which cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and > gymnastics; early in the same period the theory of the Five Elements was > propounded by Tsou Yen, whose followers are thought to have started research > on the elixir of life; and lastly, along the northeastern coasts of China, > ships began to sail out in search of the Isles of the Blest, hoping to > return with the mushroom that \\"prevented death\\". (1957:89‚Äì90) Welch (1957:96‚Äì97) concludes that fangshi developed alchemy, \\"although Tsou Yen gradually acquired alchemistical stature, he himself knew nothing of the art. It was probably developed by those of his followers who became interested in physical experimentation with the Five Elements. The first elixir they developed was cinnabar, or mercuric sulphide.\\" Joseph Needham traced the origins of Daoism to an alliance between fangshi, wu \\"shamans; doctors\\" and philosophers such as Laozi and Zhuangzi: > At the heart of ancient Taoism there was an artisanal element, for both the > wizards and the philosophers were convinced that important and useful things > could be achieved by using one's hands. They did not participate in the > mentality of the Confucian scholar-administrator, who sat on high in his > tribunal issuing orders and never employing his hands except in reading and > writing. This is why it came about that wherever in ancient China one finds > the sprouts of any of the natural sciences the Taoists are sure to be > involved. The fang shih or 'gentlemen possessing magical recipes' were > certainly Taoist, and they worked in all kinds of directions as star-clerk > and weather-forecasters, men of farm-lore and wort-cunning, irrigators and > bridge-builders, architects and decorators, but above all alchemists. Indeed > the beginning of all alchemy rests with them if we define it, as surely we > should, as the combination of macrobiotics and aurifaction. (2000:58) Needham defined his \\"carefully chosen\\" words: macrobiotics \\"the belief that, with the aid of botany, zoology, mineralogy, and alchemy, it is possible to prepare drugs or elixirs which will prolong life, giving longevity (shou ) or immortality (pu ssu )\\" and aurifaction \\"the belief that it is possible to make gold from other quite different substances, notably the ignoble metals\\". Csikszentmihalyi summarizes Daoist-fangshi connections, > The \\"methods\\" of the fangshi may be seen as forerunners of organized Taoist > practices on several levels. In the Han, the concept of the Dao served to > explain the efficacy of the myriad of newly forming disciplines, and many of > these disciplines were the province of the fangshi. This explains why the > term daoshi ( masters of the Dao) was already beginning to replace the term > fangshi () in the Hanshu, resulting in its gradual eclipse of the latter > term. On a more concrete level, many specific techniques of spirit > transcendence, medicine, and alchemy initially used by fangshi found their > way into later Taoist practice. (2008:408-9) Criticism Gu Yong (d. 8 BCE), minister to Emperor Cheng of Han, specialist on the Yijing, is known for harsh criticism of the contemporary fangshi practices: > All those occultists, who turn their backs on the right path of benevolence > and correct duty, who do not revere the model of the Five Classics but who > rather are brimming with claims about the strange and marvelous, about > spirits and ghosts, who stand in unquestioning reverence of the sacrificial > practices of every locale,... who say that immortals are to be found in this > world and who imbibe all manner of longevity drugs, who capriciously set out > on distant quests and travel so high that their shadows are cast upwards,... > who have mastered the transformation of base metal to gold, who have made > uniform the five colors and five stores within their bodies ‚Äî those > occultists cheat people and delude the masses.Liu Kwang-ching, ‚ÄúSocioethics > as Orthodoxy,‚Äù in Liu Kwang-ching, ed., Orthodoxy In Late Imperial China > (Berkeley, 1990), 53‚Äì100:59.

World usage In India, the term \\"statutory auditor\\" refers to an external auditor whose appointment is mandated by law. A \\"statutory audit\\" is a legally required review of the accuracy of a company's or government's financial records. The purpose of a statutory audit is the same as the purpose of any other audit - to determine whether an organization is providing a fair and accurate representation of its financial position by examining information such as bank balances, bookkeeping records and financial transactions. The European Union has also made efforts to mandate statutory audits and statutory auditors on an EU-wide level. Japanese usage A is an official found in Japanese kabushiki gaisha (business corporations). Similar roles are also found in Taiwan and South Korea, which use modified forms of Japanese corporate law, although the English translation most commonly employed for the role in these countries is supervisor or supervisory board. Statutory auditors are elected by shareholders and hold a position in the hierarchy alongside the board of directors. A kabushiki kaisha must have at least one statutory auditor, unless the transfer of shares is restricted in the articles of incorporation. If the company is classified as a \\"large\\" company (i.e. with more than ¬•500 million in paid-in capital or ¬•20 billion in liabilities), it must have three statutory auditors, or an audit, compensation and nominating committee system similar to that used by public companies in the US. Statutory auditors have several functions: # They initiate derivative suits against the board of directors on behalf of the shareholders, and represent the company in those suits. This right was once reserved for the auditor; however, following precedent from a recent lawsuit against Daiwa Bank, groups of shareholders can now file suits themselves without going through the auditor. # In \\"mid-size\\" and \\"large\\" companies (i.e. with more than ¬•100 million of paid-in capital), they have the right to attend board meetings to monitor the directors' actions. # In \\"mid-size\\" companies, they audit the financial reports submitted by the company. # In \\"large\\" companies, they oversee auditing performed by external certified public accountants, i.e. external auditors. Statutory auditors are often selected from among the senior management of the company, or are former directors of related companies (such as suppliers or keiretsu partners). The role of the statutory auditor in Japan is distinct from the role of an external auditor or internal auditor as understood in English-speaking countries, which has led to some confusion when discussing their role in internationally prominent cases such as the Olympus scandal. The Japanese association of statutory auditors has recommended adopting the English title \\"audit & supervisory board member\\" to avoid such confusion.

Founded in 1925, the college has grown from a small college of the arts with minimal faculty and only 100 students to the second largest college on campus. With more than 3,800 students and 141 full-time faculty, the expansive college has spread across the university's campus and occupies six buildings (Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center, George H. Brimhall Building, Jesse Knight Building, Stephen L. Richards Building, B66, and the BYU Museum of Art). With four departments (Dance, Theatre and Media Arts, Art, Design ) and two schools (Communications, Music), the CFAC offers 14 undergraduate degrees (with 38 emphases) and eight graduate degrees. Since 1971, BYU performing arts groups have performed more than 14,000 shows in all 50 states and more than 100 countries of the world. Worldwide audiences totaling more than 12 million people, have also included radio and TV broadcasts reaching billions. History Owned and operated by The LDS Church, BYU's CFAC has close ties to The Church's religious history and its members' passion for the arts. As Mormon pioneers crossed the plains in the efforts to reach the Great Salt Lake Valley, many pioneer men and women renewed themselves through music and dancing. Following their arrival in the valley, Church leaders established several different communities and the arts were central to the settlements they erected and were equally important to the pioneers' individual lives.William E. Purdy, \\"Music in Mormon Culture, 1830‚Äì1876\\", PhD diss., Northwestern University, 1960 Brigham Young Academy Brigham Young Academy was organized in 1875 and shortly after its establishment, a choir was organized to sing at events and religious services. By 1883 the Department of Music was organized as an extracurricular body and by the early 1900s the Academy had a band, orchestra, and choir; music was being integrated into the school's core curriculum and departments of art and speech were both organized. In 1925, under the direction of BYU President Franklin Stewart Harris, the College of Fine Arts was organized with Gerrit de Jong as its first dean. The new college became the first fine arts college in the western United States and brought together the pre-existing departments of music, art and dramatic arts and speech.(Wilkinson, Ernest L. ‚ÄúBrigham Young University : the first one hundred years.‚Äù Provo, Utah : Brigham Young University Press. 1975. 2:101, 2:776) The music department was initially composed of a vocal and instrumental division. At the time the college was created, the department had limited full-time faculty (Robert Sauer, Franklin Madsen, Florence Jepperson Madsen, and Margaret Summerhays). Each of these faculty members was responsible for conducting all the classes for the department and the school's group ensembles. The art department consisted of Bent Franklin Larsen and Elbert Hindley Eastmond. Within the next decade the faculty gained the skills of Verla L. Birrell, Lynn Taylor, and J. Roman Andrus. The department not only managed the instruction of the arts, but also began a standing collection of art pieces to be housed at the university. By the end of Franklin's administration, the department had accumulated roughly 700 pieces on behalf of the university. The department of public speaking and dramatic arts was originally headed by T. Earl Pardoe.(Wilkinson, Ernest L. ‚ÄúBrigham Young University : the first one hundred years.‚Äù Provo, Utah : Brigham Young University Press. 1975. 2:285) The organization of the college was a major accomplishment for the arts at BYU but the programs lacked a central building. Musicians in need of practice space would often congregate in bathrooms.(Wilkinson, Ernest L. ‚ÄúBrigham Young University : the first one hundred years.‚Äù Provo, Utah : Brigham Young University Press. 1975. 2:633) Rehearsals for plays and productions were held in the Joseph Smith Building in shifts (one in the afternoon, one in the evening, and one starting around midnight). Musical productions struggled to overcome the poor acoustics and lighting in the Smith Fieldhouse however, despite the many space issues, the programs were academically strong and continually succeeded. After attending several rehearsals the 1956 University Accreditation Team reported the arts instruction to be of superior quality (Wilkinson, Ernest L. ‚ÄúBrigham Young University : the first one hundred years.‚Äù Provo, Utah : Brigham Young University Press. 1975. 2:660) and the college began its path to national and international recognition. Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center (HFAC), at the heart of BYU's Provo, Utah, campus In the 1958, the university allotted a portion of its budget to construct a fine arts center. The building was projected to cost $5 million, 80 percent of which came directly from the Church. Internationally acclaimed architect William L. Pereira was hired to design the building and construction on the Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center (HFAC) began in 1962. It was completed in 1964 at a cost of $7 million making it the most expensive building on campus at the time.(Wilkinson, Ernest L. ‚ÄúBrigham Young University : the first one hundred years.‚Äù Provo, Utah : Brigham Young University Press. 1975. 3:43‚Äì44) While the HFAC was under construction, another major change was made to the college ‚Äì the university's administration approved the addition of a Department of Communications to the growing college. The department's addition to the college officially changed its name to the College of Fine Arts and Communications. The new department adopted the former Department of Journalism (formerly housed in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences), the broadcasting program (formerly housed in the Department of Dramatic Arts and the photography program (formerly housed in the Department of Visual Arts.(Wilkinson, Ernest L. ‚ÄúBrigham Young University : the first one hundred years.‚Äù Provo, Utah : Brigham Young University Press. 1975. 3:82) Responding to a request from the university's administration, the college piloted an academic advisement program. In 1973, the College Advisement Center opened its doors. It was the first center of its kind on campus, offering one-on-one consultations to students regarding their class schedules and graduation plans. The pilot program was successful and the College of Fine Arts and Communications Advisement Center became the model for similar centers started across campus. From 1968 to 1974 the Department of Theatre operated the Brigham Young University Touring Repertory Theatre. The program was set up like professional repertory theaters with actors learning multiple parts for multiple productions. The program toured regularly and had a total of approximately 200,000 spectators.Wilkinson. First 100. Vol. 3, p. 384. In 2003 the BYU Adlab was created and has won numerous student advertising awards. The college continued to undergo numerous changes and transitions over the years, but two of the most significant changes in recent past occurred in 2009 when the university's administration removed BYU Broadcasting from under the college's umbrellahttp://history.cfac.byu.edu/index.php/Category:BYU_Broadcasting and added the Department of Dance (The department had previously been housed in the former College of Health and Human Performance prior to its dissolution in the summer of 2009.).http://news.byu.edu/archive09-Jun-dancemove.aspx The Department of Dance has been tied closely to the college for years and prior to its addition to the college, the department had been one of the few dance departments in the country that was not housed under the fine arts.

The third, as yet unreleased, film in the trilogy, Life of an Artist, examines the 'limits of art'. In Permanent Residence, Hung's character, named Windson, is a straight young man who is befriended by a young gay man, Ivan (played by Sean Li), seeking a long-term relationship.

St. Andrew's Tenaille in Valletta A tenaille (archaic tenalia) is an advanced defensive-work, in front of the main defences of a fortress, which takes its name from resemblance, real or imaginary, to the lip of a pair of pincers. It is \\"from French, literally: tongs, from Late Latin tenƒÅcula, pl of tenaculum\\".\\"tenaille\\", American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company. In a letter to John Bradshaw, President of the Council of State in London, Oliver Cromwell writing from Dublin on 16 September 1649 described one such tenaille that played a significant part during the storming of Drogheda. Tenaille were a development in fortification formalised by Vauban, among others. A postern gate was placed low down in the curtain wall close to the centre in order to allow the defenders to access the ditches that front the wall. To protect the postern, an outwork, originally V-shaped, was placed in front of the gate, providing an area where the defenders could leave the fortification without being seen or directly shot at. A simple tenaille is shown in the top image to the right; it is the chevron between the two corner bastions. The design also evolved a version in which the tenaille possesses projections at each end, as seen in the middle image to the right. The name was also used for some other V-shaped parts of outworks; the bottom-most image, a priest's cap, has two tenailles. Also shown is another approach to protect a gate; the roughly triangular outwork seen in the middle of the bottom drawing is a ravelin.

She made her first on-screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 17 July 2009. Holly was introduced to the soap as part of the Bartons, a new farming family who took over the running of Butler's Farm. Holly was joined by her mother, father and two siblings. The family were described as being \\"sexy, modern and contemporary\\" by the show's series producer, Gavin Blyth. Holly departed on 20 June 2012, but Powles later reprised her role and Holly returned on 24 March 2016 for a six-month stint. The character was killed off on 29 September 2016. Creation and casting In May 2009, it was announced that Emmerdale's new series producer, Gavin Blyth, would introduce The Bartons, a new farming family, as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show. The family, which comprises five members - mother, father, two daughters and a son - took over the running of Butler's Farm. Of the family, Blyth said \\"I don't want to make Emmerdale a show about teenagers and young people, it's about family values. The Bartons are sexy, modern and contemporary. They're almost happy - and in soapland that's quite strange!\\" Natalie J. Robb and James Thornton were cast in the roles of parents, John and Moira. Adam Thomas and Grace Cassidy were cast as their children Adam and Hannah. Former Britannia High actress Sophie Powles was cast in the role of eldest daughter Holly. Powles received a call from her agent telling her about an audition for Emmerdale, which she thought was a great opportunity. Following the audition, Powles attended the subsequent recalls, before getting down to the final four. After a screen test with Robb and Thornton, Powles was given the role. Shortly before filming her first scenes, the actress had to go shopping for Holly's costumes and had her hair dyed brown for the part. Of her casting, Powles said \\"I always wanted to act and especially because it's a northern show and my family live just down the road in Otley, so I've got a strong Yorkshire connection. I did my first scene in the Woolpack and I was just amazed at how real it was and I feel so lucky to be doing a job I enjoy on a show that I love. It's really cool.\\" Development=Characterisation Holly is described as being a \\"free spirit with a sense of adventure.\\" Powles opined Holly is \\"the kind of girl who will get on with anybody.\\" She becomes friends with the people she meets and does not judge a book by its cover. Holly is loyal to her family and close to her mother, who she shares a strong bond with. Holly and her brother, Adam, have grown up together and there is only a year between them. Adam is quite protective of his sister. Holly loves Hannah to bits and they enjoy teasing each other. Holly does not spend her time reading fashion magazines and she wears whatever she is comfortable in. Powles told the Liverpool Daily Post Holly \\"loves who she is and she's really happy. She's not image conscious and doesn't waste time thinking 'I'm too fat' or 'I'm too thin'.\\" Upon her entrance to the show, Holly had not had a boyfriend before. Susan Griffin of the Liverpool Daily Post said she would not go short of an admirer or two, and Powles added \\"Holly wouldn't go for someone who was typically good-looking. She doesn't go for the obvious.\\" The actress thought Holly may have some unexpected friendships and relationships, which would work. When Powles was asked if she was anything like Holly in real life, she told Inside Soap, \\"I used to be quite similar to her when she got on well with her family and was bubbly - but now she's very moody and stroppy, I'm nothing like her!\\" Holly's descent into drugs changed her personality and Steve Hendry of the Daily Record noted Holly was once a girl from a good family with a cheeky twinkle in her eye and she had become a \\"desperate soul who is dragging her family down into the gutter along with her.\\" Hendry pointed out Holly had acted out of character and Powles agreed, saying \\"When I came into Emmerdale Holly was a very bubbly character, obviously a bit cheeky and a bit naughty but never would you think she'd do drugs. That's why they picked her, to show there is no stereotype of the kind of person who gets into drugs.\\" Powles said Holly had turned into a \\"nasty creature\\" because of the drugs. The actress believed Holly has always been fiery, but when she gets intimidated that turns into aggression, which worries her family. Relationship with Aaron Livesy Holly's first love interest was Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller). Aaron took an interest in Holly shortly after she arrived and he often came to the farm to see her. In August 2009, Aaron almost sets fire to a barn and he is locked up by John. Aaron has John arrested and his mother tells the Bartons that she cannot get him to drop the charges, so Holly \\"decides to take more direct action\\" by seducing him into dropping the case. However, Aaron realises what her plan is and he calls her bluff by telling her that he will drop the charges if she has sex with him. A writer for the Sunday Mail said Aaron's offer leads \\"a disgusted Holly to storm out\\", leaving him feeling guilty. A Daily Record reporter stated that Aaron appeared to have destroyed any chance he had with Holly, but she showed \\"incredibly bad taste in the opposite sex\\" by choosing to date him. Aaron later tries to kiss Holly's brother, Adam, and he struggles with his sexuality. When he asks Holly out, Adam warns his sister that she can do much better, but she does not listen and spends the evening with Aaron. During an interview with a What's on TV writer, Miller explained that Aaron uses Holly to convince people that he is not gay. When asked if Aaron fancies Holly or if he is just using her, Miller said \\"He does genuinely like Holly but he is sexually confused and constantly questioning himself 'Am I gay? Am I not gay? Do I want Holly? Or Adam?' It's a love triangle in the most confusing sense for Aaron. He wants to convince everyone, including himself, he isn't gay.\\" Adam later tells Holly that Aaron tried to kiss him, but she does not believe him. Holly breaks up with Aaron when she tires of their relationship. Drug addiction In 2010, Holly became Emmerdale's first teenage drug-addict. Holly starts using drugs recreationally and she gives Maisie Wylde (Alice Coulthard) cocaine during a night out. Holly is fired from her job at Home Farm, when Maisie's mother, Natasha (Amanda Donohoe), finds out. In April 2010, Roz Fielding (Kirsty-Leigh Porter) was introduced to Emmerdale. Roz became Holly's cocaine dealer and she often joined Holly in taking the drug. Holly's drug use begins to affect her college work and she is later thrown out of college for dealing drugs. Holly decides to get clean, but she cannot resist stealing some ketamine and swapping it for cocaine. Powles told Inside Soap Holly does not like it when she is in her parent's bad books, so she tries to stay clean. However, she cannot help herself. While out clubbing with Aaron Livesy and Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock), Holly bumps into Roz and they drink and take cocaine. Holly decides to flirt with a stranger for more drugs and she takes an ecstasy pill. Holly succumbs to the effects of the drug and she has a nasty turn. Powles explained \\"She locks herself in a toilet cubicle because she doesn't know what's happening to her. Holly feels her whole world is going to explode. It's a bit like an out-of-body experience for her.\\" Powles added Holly is panicking and crying, so Aaron and Jackson kick the toilet door down and look after her. Aaron takes Holly home and she promises him it will never happen again. Powles revealed Aaron is unaware of how dependent on drugs Holly has become and the actress promised Holly would face more trouble in the future. Kirsty-Leigh Porter was cast in the role of Holly's friend and drug dealer, Roz Fielding. Powles said she has researched her character's storyline, by consulting a drug support group and talking to recovering addicts and the people who work with them. The actress said she did not have any experiences with the situation and she asked about how she should act. Holly is later disowned by her father and she runs away. Holly meets Dan Cravely (James Boyland), a drug dealer, who allows Holly to stay with him. Powles explained Dan is everything Holly wants, he may not be a nice person, but he can supply her with drugs. Powles said Holly is using drugs heavily and not being at home means she can take the drugs whenever she likes. Holly runs into Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey-Beth Crossley) and Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw) in town and she asks Scarlett for money, but Scarlett lies that she does not have any. Scarlett later asks Holly to meet her, but it is a set up and John and Adam arrive instead. Powles said Holly is furious and cannot believe she fell for the trick. John tries talking to Holly, but does not get through to her and he tries to manhandle her into his car. Holly manages to escape and decides to rob her family, so she can raise money to buy more drugs. Holly and some of her friends take laptops, jewellery and other valuable possessions from Butler's Farm. Powles told Inside Soap that John and Moira are left in disbelief at what their daughter has done as they did not think she would ever do something like that. Powles opined Holly had lost all her \\"morals and sense of consequences\\" and the old Holly had gone. She added things would get worse for Holly before they get better. Dan eventually throws Holly out onto the streets and she heads back home. Powles told What's on TV Holly becomes more concerned about where she will get her drugs from than where she lives, but she goes to the village while under the influence of drugs. Ashley and Douglas Potts (Duncan Preston) find Holly in the graveyard and they call John and Moira to collect her. Holly starts going through cold turkey and her parents call a doctor. Powles said Holly asks for \\"tranquillisers, sleeping pills, anything\\" because she has been without drugs for weeks. Moira asks Holly to leave if she is going to continue using drugs and Powles said Holly admits she has a problem because of her mother's behaviour. When asked how tough the storyline has been, Powles replied \\"It's fantastic as an actress to have such a big storyline, but it's hard at times. When I get home after work I ask my boyfriend to make me laugh because I've been crying all day!\\" Holly decides to attend a counselling session with Moira, but she immediately resents it and during a moment alone, she runs away and buys some heroin. Holly returns home and John and Moira find her collapsed in her bedroom. They try to wake her up and she tells them she took heroin, before passing out again. Holly begins taking methadone to help her get off the drugs, but she starts craving heroin. Holly realises she has no money and sells her body to a stranger to fund her habit. Holly confesses to John and Moira about what she has done and they decide to lock her in her bedroom, forcing her to go cold turkey. John's death and relapse In February 2012, John dies, following a car accident. Holly struggles to cope with John's death as he was her best friend as well as her father. Powles told a writer for All About Soap that Holly lost her friends and her independence when she became addicted to drugs and John protected her. Powles explained \\"He kind of became her addiction, so with him gone that support has disappeared suddenly and she feels very lost and empty.\\" Holly begins to resent Moira when she sees her lying around grieving for John because she blames her for causing a split within the family due to her affair with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). However, Hannah tells Holly that if she had not got into drugs then there would not have been any tension between Moira and John in the first place. Holly and Moira have an argument when Holly washes some bed sheets that still smell of John and Powles said Holly is fed up of everyone thinking the worst of her when she is trying her best. Things become too much for Holly when the family discuss where to scatter John's ashes as she is not ready to let go and move on. Powles said \\"The agony's overwhelming and the only thing Holly can think of to get over the pain is to take a hit of heroin, so she succumbs - and goes out and scores a couple of wraps.\\" Holly keeps the drugs hidden in her room as she thinks about whether to take them or not. She is tempted to have a small hit to numb her pain. Powles added that Holly does not want to cause her family anymore heartache, but she will carry \\"the heroin-taking ghost\\" in the back of her mind forever. Holly gives in and takes the heroin after the family gather to scatter John's ashes. She is still not ready to let go and Powles told Inside Soap's Katy Moon \\"John's funeral was bad enough because she was trying to be strong for her brother and sister. Scattering her dad's ashes is just too much, and she feels Moira is being very pushy about it.\\" After the family say goodbye, Holly prepares to take the drugs, but Alex Moss (Kurtis Stacey) stops her. He tells her to be strong for her family as she is the one person holding the family together. Moon stated that Holly takes Alex's words the wrong way and she feels that the only way to get through the situation is to numb the pain with heroin. Despite Alex getting rid of the drugs, he is unaware that Holly has more hidden away. She takes a hit and overdoses. Powles explained that Holly does not mean to overdose. She previously had a high tolerance for heroin, but when she uses it again after being clean for so long, her body cannot cope with it. Holly collapses near the local garage and she is found by Cain. Powles told Moon that Cain is initially reluctant to help Holly as he thinks his actions could be misinterpreted. He is worried that people will think he is doing it to try and redeem himself, but his instincts take over and he takes her to the hospital. Powles stated \\"The Bartons find it very difficult to swallow their pride and accept that Cain deserves their thanks, but Holly is really defensive of him.\\" The actress added that it is \\"a terrible time\\" for the family; Moira has lost her husband, so she could not bear to lose her daughter too. Departure On 15 January 2012, Susan Hill of the Daily Star announced Powles had quit her role as Holly and would depart sometime in the Summer. Her decision to leave Emmerdale came shortly after it was revealed Thornton, who played her on screen father John, would also be leaving the show. Powles told Hill \\"I have had an awesome three years at Emmerdale. I have made the best friends and have worked, had fun and learned so much with an amazing cast and crew. But after three years I am ready for some freedom to travel and be able to say yes to other projects and opportunities. I just want to say thank-you to everyone at Emmerdale for making it such a brilliant place to work.\\" Hill reported Kirsty-Leigh Porter would be returning for a brief stint as Roz for Holly's exit, which was likely be a \\"less dramatic affair\\" than John's. Powles later revealed to Claire Donnelly of The People that she was starting to feel \\"a bit tied down\\" with her routine and she got itchy feet. The actress said \\"People will think I'm mad giving up a job like this but I know it is the right thing for me to do.\\" Powles continued to film until May and she made her screen departure on 20 June 2012. Holly's exit storyline sees her leave the village after accepting a job as a trainee designer in London. Holly invites Hannah to accompany her. Moira initially refuses to allow her to leave, but relents and says goodbye to her daughters. Return On 5 February 2016, new series producer Iain MacLeod announced that Powles had reprised her role and would be returning to Emmerdale the following month. MacLeod stated that Holly would bring \\"fresh trouble to the Dales\\" and cause trouble for her stepfather Cain. The producer continued, \\"Holly arrives with trouble trailing behind her and then we see Cain do what he does best, which is step in and save the day as only he can.\\" Holly returned on 24 March 2016. Death On 29 September, the character was killed off after suffering a heroin overdose. Holly's mother Moira was seen struggling to wake her daughter, until she realised that Holly was dead. The storyline was not announced ahead of its broadcast, allowing viewers to be surprised. In an interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Powles told him that when she was asked to return, she had known it would only be for a six-month storyline focusing on Holly's drug addiction. Powles found the storyline \\"challenging\\", but pointed out that it was \\"a very serious and stark warning\\" showing the effects that drug addiction can have on people. She also stated that Holly's addiction came about from one bad decision and her \\"addictive personality\\", which eventually got out of control. Powles added that she was proud of the storyline and hoped it would raise awareness. Storylines=2009‚Äì2012 Holly and her family arrive in the village and move into Butler's Farm.

Reception In 2011, Holly's drug addiction was nominated for \\"Best Storyline\\" at the British Soap Awards. Daily Mirror writer, Tony Stewart, said Holly's drug addiction was \\"one of the most harrowing\\" storylines of 2010. He added \\"With a powerful and moving performance by relative newcomer Sophie Powles, Holly Barton has been transformed from a vivacious young student to a drug-ravaged, emaciated heroin addict over the last few months.\\" Stewart's colleague, Jane Simon, said Holly was a \\"pretty Anna Friel look-alike.\\" Simon later asked \\"If one of the Bartons had to die, why couldn't it have been vile Holly with her stupid voice like a creaky door?\\" Claire Donnelly of The People said Powles had made \\"quite an impact as junkie Holly\\", with some members of the public coming up to the actress and asking her for drugs in the street. In August 2017, Holly's death was longlisted for Best Shock Twist at the Inside Soap Awards. The nomination made the viewer-voted shortlist, but it lost out to the return of Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) in Coronation Street.

It also features a duet between Bonds and Springsteen on the track \\"Jole Blon\\". Bonds' early 1960s sound had been a major influence on both Springsteen and Van Zandt. The songs written by Springsteen, including the cover of \\"Jole Blon\\", were originally intended for his 1980 album, The River, but he felt they fit better with Bonds and his versions of them have never been released although he has performed most of them live, often featuring Bonds as a special guest.http://brucebase.wikispaces.com/The+River+-+Studio+Sessions The album produced several singles.

The paper was co-founded by three men: Frank Kathman, who took the role of Publisher; Laurence Kee, as Managing Editor; and Michael Carlson (now Harman), as Art Director. While the three devoted their full-time energies to the daily running and initial growth of the paper, several members of the Bellingham community made major contributions to the content and character of the publication.  Publication history  From its inception, the Northwest Passage stood out from other \\"underground\\" tabloids at the time because of its graphic design content, which was spearheaded by Carlson, and embellished by the talents of artists Cindy Green, Gary Hallgren, and others. (Hallgren went on to a noted career as a New York-based graphics artist, illustrator, and cartoonist.) Frank Kathman had originally been influenced by a college class that he took with http://www.bernardweiner.org Bernard Weiner] at Western Washington State College (now University), where the underground press was studied. Later, Kathman and Carlson wrote and designed a recruitment poster that was printed, calling for the founding of the paper. They recruited Kee, who was a reporter for the Bellingham Herald, and the only one of the three with a steady paycheck, so it came down to him to write a check to the Lynden Tribune on March 17, 1969, in order to get the first issue printed. Kee was later fired from the conservative Herald for his involvement with the Passage. The paper was sustained from that point on by personal donations from the community; by sales in a few news boxes and through personal hawking campaigns in Bellingham and Seattle; through subscriptions sold to individuals and university and community libraries all over the country; and through the sale of display advertising ‚Äî most notably through a deal with Warner Bros. Records. The Tribune later refused to print the Passage, bending to conservative political pressures in the county, and the Passage was moved to the Skagit Valley Herald for further printing. Published in tabloid newspaper format and selling for 25 cents, it was a member of the Underground Press Syndicate and the Liberation News Service, and reported circulation of 6000 copies in 1972. Crews of volunteers set type and did layout. The Northwest Passage was originally housed in Kee's home on Maplewood Ave., where the bedrooms were converted to graphics layout rooms. Later, when Kee and the paper were evicted from the rented house, the Passage moved to a house in the outlying area, on Yew Street Rd. The next home of the paper was in a taxidermy building on W. Holly St., near the downtown area. Later, the paper moved to offices in the Morgan Block Building in the Fairhaven District of Bellingham, known as \\"Happy Valley\\", or the \\"Southside\\". \\"Happy Valley\\" had been a common name for the area since before the founding of Fairhaven. The Block building also housed Good Earth Pottery, Fairhaven Music, and the Community Food Co-op, and was a hive of the counterculture from 1969 through the end of the Vietnam War. At the time, Fairhaven was a hippie enclave‚Äîa temporary autonomous zone of cooperative enterprise that spawned the community garden program, a cooperative primary school, and a co-op flour mill (it has since become a family-owned business and moved out of Bellingham), all of which are still thriving forty years later. Though initially a kind of hippie paper focusing on the counterculture and ending the Vietnam War, under the leadership of Kathman and Kee, and later Chris Condon and others, it quickly became an important source of investigative journalism on political and environmental issues in Bellingham and the Pacific Northwest in general. Its environmental journalism earned it such a solid reputation ‚Äî sometimes influencing policy decisions ‚Äî that politicians and oversight agencies and polluting corporations made sure to subscribe or obtain copies to read. During the People's Park riots in Berkeley, California during the summer of 1969, the Passage was chosen as the pool print representative for the national media, and was allowed inside the Park to be \\"embedded\\" with the armed National Guard unit that was holding the Park against the siege conducted by thousands of demonstrators who were trying to get the park restored to its former use as a public area. The resulting article by Kee was representative of other reporting by the Passage which was often quoted by other publications and even reprinted by some on occasion. Although the editorial and reporting reach of the Passage extended out into the nation and the world, the paper nevertheless retained its local community feeling in Bellingham throughout its existence. Original editor Laurence Kee left the paper to found the Seattle rock band Child, and in Los Angeles played with the Eric Burdon Band and others, before coming back to Bellingham to teach at Western Washington University's Fairhaven College in their \\"Artist-In-Residence\\" program. From 1969 to 1977 Northwest Passage was based in Bellingham, relocating in 1977 to Seattle.AP. \\"Crusading newspaper close to going under\\". The Spokesman-Review Jul. 10, 1984; p.

After a two-hour running fight she succeeded in capturing Aimable Therese, a small French privateer lugger of four guns and 27 men. At the time, Ann was in company with sloop and the hired armed cutter Nox. On 11 October Ann and the hired armed cutter Lion recaptured three small vessels. On the evening of 21 November, after a chase of five hours, Ann captured the French privateer cutter Petit Diable some three to four leagues south-southwest of Beachy Head. Commanded by Simon Robert Saltitat, Petit Diable was two days out of Dieppe and carried only eight men with small arms. The rest of the crew had been sent back to France in a small sloop the privateer had cut out from Seaford Roads the previous night. On 28 November Ann captured the fishing boats Brune and St Joseph. Ann captured the vessel Grosser Steir on 27 March 1800. In July 1800, Ann participated in the Raid on Dunkirk, which resulted in the cutting out of the French frigate D√©sir√©e. During the action on 8 July, Ann, together with the gun-brig Biter and the hired armed cutter Kent, engaged some French gunboats and prevented them from intervening. Biter had three officers and men wounded and each of the cutters suffered one man wounded.

John and Maxine Renaker started the company in their garage in Culver City, California making plates, butter pats, and bowls. There was much waste due to glaze imperfections and kiln problems. Meanwhile, Maxine made a little duck to show a Brownie troop touring the factory how pottery was made. The duck was fired in the kiln between the larger items, and was an immediate success. John realized the potential for animal figurines, and began making them exclusively. Career With the help of Maxine's father Ole Hagen, the couple built their first, small factory in Monrovia, California in 1946. The hyphenated name of the company was a way to thank and pay tribute to Ole Hagen. Decorator Helen Perrin Farnlund was hired early in the history of the company, and became known as the designer who created the majority of the \\"cute\\" animal and human models. Maureen Love was hired originally as a decorator, but quickly established herself as a designer of realistic animals. Most of the horses, and much of the realistic wildlife, farm, and domestic animals were created by Maureen. Tom Masterson was added in the early 1950s, and is known for the realistic Pedigree Dog line, plus some other large animals. Other designers included Nell Bortells, who did many of the Disney pieces and the Little Horribles line of caricature critters, and Martha Armstrong-Hand, who also did some Disney pieces, cats, and some human models. Don Winton and Will Climes, who had their own California pottery companies, also did design for Hagen- Renaker. Don in particular designed many of the Hagen-Renaker Disney pieces. The company moved around southern California following the ebb and flow of the economy. During the early years of the post-World War II economic expansion, from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, the factory expanded to several buildings in Monrovia. Later, as the competition from Japanese ceramics started to cut into the domestic business, Hagen-Renaker collapsed back down to one building in Monrovia. In the early 1960s, they moved the factory to San Dimas, California where John Renaker also had a plant nursery. The factory remains there to this day. During a brief attempt at expansion, Hagen-Renaker purchased the Freeman-McFarlin factory in San Marcos, California and produced the Designers Workshop line there from 1980‚Äì1986. They then closed that facility and regrouped all resources in San Dimas. This is important because when collectors refer to pieces made by Hagen-Renaker, one way they are identified is by the factory where they were produced. Each factory has its own style and features. There are roughly three sizes of pottery animals. The Designers Workshop line consists of animals in approximately the 5\\" to 12\\" range. The horses by Maureen Love are the most desirable and highly collectible items from this line. There are also farm animals, wild animals, and domestic animals in this size range. They were produced from the early 1950s through the mid-1980s, and the horses are currently (late 2000s) being released again. The miniature line was the first line made when Maxine produced the little duck, and the miniatures remain popular today. A relatively new line, Specialty size, was started in the 1990s and continues today. It can be described as being between the size of the miniatures and the Designer Workshop pieces. Personal life John and Maxine Renaker retired from the pottery business in 1996, and their oldest daughter Susan Renaker Nikas took over running the company. As of 2013 the factory is still producing miniatures, specialty pieces, and limited editions of the larger Designers Workshop horses. Maxine Hagen Renaker died in July 2003. She wrote a memoir of her childhood in Red Lodge, Montana and Williston, North Dakota entitled \\"One Lucky Kid.\\" The book was published originally in 1993 and reissued in 2008. John Renaker has published two books unrelated to the ceramics business: Dr.Strangelove and the Hideous Epoch; Deterrence in the Nuclear Age was published in 2000. A collection of essays related to his lifelong interest in science was published in 2005 and entitled; Once More into the Deja Vu.

NOWPAP region NOWPAP covers the marine and coastal zone ranging from 33¬∞N to 52¬∞N latitude, and from 121¬∞E to 143¬∞E longitude. Being one of the most densely populated parts of the world, where people are particularly dependent on the sea for their food and livelihood, the region is suffering from enormous pressures and demands on its marine environment. Thus people and ecosystems are under severe threat mainly from land-based activities and sources of pollution. Industrial effluents, untreated municipal sewage and run-off of agricultural pesticides and nutrients entering the NOWPAP marine environment cause eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HAB, also known as red tides). Other threats are from coastal development, marine transport, land reclamation and intensive mariculture and marine litter. Structure of NOWPAP NOWPAP is financed mainly by contributions from the member states to the UNEP Trust Fund for NOWPAP. Current member states are the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation, of which representatives constitute the NOWPAP Intergovernmental Meeting (IGM), the high-level governing body of NOWPAP, functions as the policy guide and decision-maker.

Early life The son of Hungarian immigrants Simon and Sara Fox, Samuel Fox was born at Zanesville, Ohio, May 15, 1884. His father was a traveling salesman who moved the family to Cleveland, Ohio, and Fox resided with his parents and sister Muriel until the age of 25.13th Census of the US; Cleveland, OH, ED 222, Sheet 10A As a young man, Fox worked as conductor of the Central High School Orchestras in Cleveland, an activity that served as a foundation for his pioneering work as a publisher of music for educational training and performance.\\"Sam Fox, 89, Dies; Music Publisher\\", New York Times, December 31, 1971 With a $300 loan in 1906, Fox founded Sandbox Music Publishing company, later called Sam Fox Publishing Company. Early Music Publishing His early efforts included the publishing of piano novelties, but he quickly branched into other types of music. Early on, Fox became acquainted with John Stepan Zamecnik, who in 1907 was named music director of the newly opened Cleveland Hippodrome Theater. Zemecnik began writing original scores for the films shown at the Hippodrome, which Fox published. The business arrangement between Fox and Zamecnik flourished and the music director became the major composer and music director for Sam Fox Publishing Company.Mont Alto: Composer Profile: J.S.

It was during the same period Fox experienced an international hit with the publishing of \\"Nola,\\" which was followed by \\"Lady of Spain\\" and \\"Neapolitan Nights,\\" both of which also achieved acclaim. His film scoring for Hollywood companies was solidified with contracts with Fox Films and Movietone News as their exclusive musical producer. The Hollywood film work led to his publication of songs in Fox films, including \\"The Good Ship Lollipop\\" sung by Shirley Temple. Later life Sam Fox later opened an office in New York, which was run by his son Frederick. Additionally, Sam Fox Publishing Company had representatives in offices in London, Paris, Berlin, Melbourne, and other cities worldwide.

It was the fourth and last building to serve as Henderson High School. The school was called \\"City High\\" to distinguish it from Henderson County High School which had opened a year earlier. History=Predecessor schools The original school was on the third floor of the city school system's first school, Center Street School, from 1870 to 1888. The first graduating class was the class of 1872. In 1888 a new high school was built at the corner of Washington and Adams Streets. This building served as the high school until 1910 and later served as a junior high and then as Central Elementary School until 1975. Barret Manual Training High School From 1910 to 1955, the high school serving white students in the Henderson city limits was Barret Manual Training High School. Though the school was named Barret in honor of James Barret, who donated property for the school, all logos still used an \\"H\\" and it was considered to be a continuation of HHS. The 1916 Barret Manual Training High School basketball team won the first state high school tournament, held at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. That first tournament was an invitational and consisted of only eight schools. Barret is one of the few schools to win the Kentucky State Tournament with an undefeated season. This tournament was two years before the formation of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association and is not shown in the press guides. In 1927 the Henderson Gleaner and Journal held a contest to have a nickname for the athletic teams, which had never had a mascot. The winner was Purple Flash, which was submitted by Sam Levy. New Henderson High School In 1955 the new Henderson High School was built to replace Barret, parts of which had been built as a mansion in 1860. The mascot was changed to Flash at this time because the school colors were changed from purple and gold to red, white, and blue. Black students in the city and county attended Douglass High School. In 1965 desegregation was completed in the city school system and Douglass was merged into Henderson City High School. In 1970, Holy Name High School, a private Catholic high school, closed and the students transferred to either the city or county high schools.. Due to the city school system being \\"landlocked\\" into the city limits which had existed years earlier, the tax base began to shrink as city residents began to move to subdivisions on the edge of town. The Henderson City Board of Education petitioned the Henderson County Board of education to merge. This took place in 1976 and the decision was made by the Henderson County Board of Education to have only one high school with all grade 10 through 12 students attending Henderson County High. Henderson City High School became the Henderson County Freshman Center for one year, before becoming Henderson County South Middle School in 1977 following the closure of Barret Junior High School. The last location of Henderson City High School was 800 South Alves Street. That location is now Henderson South Middle School.

His tenure was marked by internal christological and ecclesiological disputes. He struggled to prevent the Church of the East from aligning itself with the 'Nestorian' doctrine espoused by the metropolitan Barsauma of Nisibis. He is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East.  Historical sources  Brief accounts of Acacius's reign are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). His life is also covered in the Chronicle of Seert.  Acacius's patriarchate  Acacius played a key role in the events that led to the takeover of the Church of the East by the Nestorians in the last two decades of the fifth century. A moderate churchman, he was appointed patriarch in 485 by the political enemies of the powerful metropolitan Barsauma of Nisibis, a champion of Nestorianism, in the hope that he would prevent the takeover of the Church of the East by the Nestorians. But despite frequent quarrels with Barsauma, Acacius was unable to prevent the victory of the powerful Nestorian faction. Synods held in Beth Edrai (485) and Seleucia- Ctesiphon (486) entrenched Nestorian christology within the Church of the East. The following account of Acacius's reign [with some minor omissions] is given by Bar Hebraeus, who as a Jacobite author was prejudiced against the Nestorians. In the first sentence Barsauma (the name means 'son of fasting') is derisively nicknamed 'Bar Sula', 'son of the shoe'. > Then the bishops who had fled from Bar Sula met at Seleucia, and consecrated > a certain Acacius as their catholicus. When Barsauma of Nisibis and Magna of > Fars heard of this, they threatened to kill Acacius like his predecessor > unless he accepted their words. And he, terrified, gave in to them, chiefly > on account of the old affection that he still felt for them; for he had been > a fellow-student of Barsauma, Magna and Narsa√Ø in the school of Edessa, and > had fled from there with them; and so he did not oppose their plans. He also > convened a synod in which he confirmed the faith of Nestorius. From that > time Nestorianism held sway throughout the East, and fornication became so > common among the bishops, the priests, the deacons and the people that > Christian babies lay on the rubbish tips and in the streets, and many of > them were eaten by dogs, so that Acacius was forced to build houses to > accommodate the orphans and to feed the women so that they might bring up > the offspring of their lust. In this way, under tragic auspices, the > Nestorian faith was established in the East. > At that time Acacius was sent by the king of the Persians as an ambassador > to the emperor of the Greeks, and the western bishops met with him. He was > asked about the Nestorian heresy, but denied any knowledge of either > Nestorius or his heresy, and said that this was just a shameful name given > to them by their enemy Aksenaya. On his return to the East, Acacius found > that Barsauma had already died. Some say that the monks of Tur Abdin mobbed > him in the church and killed him with the keys of their cells, while others > say that his tomb can be seen in the church of Mar Yaqob in Nisibis.Bar > Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed.

A broken lower molar about 3.5 mm (0.14 in) long, it is from the Maastrichtian of the Maevarano Formation in northwestern Madagascar. Details of its crown morphology indicate that it is a boreosphenidan, a member of the group that includes living marsupials and placental mammals. David W. Krause, who first described the tooth in 2001, interpreted it as a marsupial on the basis of five shared characters, but in 2003 Averianov and others noted that all those are shared by zhelestid placentals and favored a close relationship between UA 8699 and the Spanish zhelestid Lainodon. Krause used the tooth as evidence that marsupials were present on the southern continents (Gondwana) as early as the late Cretaceous and Averianov and colleagues proposed that the tooth represented another example of faunal exchange between Africa and Europe at the time. Discovery and context UA 8699 was discovered in a joint study by Stony Brook University and the University of Antananarivo (UA) and placed in the collections of the latter as specimen 8699. It was found at a locality named MAD93-95 in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation, which is Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The locality is in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Several other mammals have been recovered from similarly aged Madagascar deposits, but most are also known from very limited material. These include the gondwanathere Lavanify, an indeterminate multituberculate, and a few other indeterminate teeth, as well as a nearly complete skeleton representing an otherwise unknown mammalian lineage.Krause et al., 2006, pp. 186‚Äì188 In a 2001 Nature paper, David Krause announced the discovery of UA 8699 and argued for marsupial affinities of the specimen. Because the specimen is so fragmentary, he refrained from assigning a new scientific name to the tooth. Two years later, Alexander Averianov, David Archibald, and Thomas Martin favored a placental interpretation in a paper in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, noting that the specimen was essentially similar to the zhelestid Lainodon.Averianov et al., 2003, p. 149 In a 2006 review of some of the Cretaceous vertebrates of Madagascar, Krause and colleagues continued to consider the specimen as a marsupial and announced that an upcoming paper by Case would make the case for marsupial affinities more fully.Krause et al., 2006, p. 187 Description UA 8699 is a worn and broken left lower molar. Part of the trigonid (the front group of cusps), at the mesiolingual (inner front) corner of the tooth is missing. Krause estimated that the complete tooth would have been 3.5 mm (0.14 in) long and 2.2 mm (0.09 in) wide. The tooth is tribosphenic, like that of modern mammals, as indicated by a number of features, including the broad basin of the talonid (the back group of cusps), and the acute angle (48¬∞) between the cusps of the trigonid. UA 8699 lacks a cingulid (ridge) resembling a shelf on the lingual (inner) side, indicating that is not a member of Australosphenida (the proposed clade uniting monotremes and some ancient Gondwanan mammals, including the Jurassic Madagascan Ambondro); thus, it can be identified as representing Boreosphenida, which includes marsupials, placentals, and their extinct relatives. Krause listed five features that indicate that UA 8699 is a marsupial, not a placental or primitive therian. There is a well-developed cingulid at the outer back margin (distobuccally), between the hypoconid (one of the main cusps) and the hypoconulid (a smaller cuspule). The hypoconulid itself is located far lingually, relatively far from the hypoconid. The trigonid and talonid are about as broad, the trigonid is low-crowned, and wear is mainly horizontal, resulting in broad, flat exposed wear facets. Averianov and colleagues noted that zhelestids, a placental group, share all those traits, though to varying degrees, and that the hypoconulid in similarly aged marsupials is even more lingually located, \\"twinned\\" to the entoconid (the cusp on the back lingual corner of the tooth). They wrote that the specimen is on the whole more similar to zhelestids than to marsupials. Interpretations Krause wrote that UA 8699 was the first marsupial to be identified from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials date back to the Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the Paleocene in South America; although Cretaceous marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must already have colonized the southern continents by the late Cretaceous, presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late Cretaceous, boreosphenidans must already have been in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, as suggested by the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the Cretaceous of India. Averianov, Archibald, and Martin instead placed UA 8699 in the context of faunal similarity and exchange between the late Cretaceous faunas of Europe and Africa, noting the presence of similar animals, such as snakes (Medtsoia) and sauropods (Lirainosaurus and Repetosaurus), in the Cretaceous faunas of Madagascar and the Spanish locality La√±o. They proposed the relationship between Lainodon, which is from La√±o, and UA 8699 as another example of this relationship and cited a previous prediction by Gheerbrant and Astibia that zhelestids similar to Lainodon would be found in Africa.

These religions' sacred texts and traditions have all tolerated slavery, which has frequently involved the sexual exploitation of women and girls. Brooten heads a team of scholars, activists, artists, and policy analysts who are disentangling the nexus of slavery, religion, women, and sexuality. They aim to help religious and other people complete the abolition of slavery and move beyond harmful racial and sexual stereotypes.

It is a reworking of the Cinderella fairy tale that reimagines the title character, Ash, as a lesbian teenager. The novel centers around the familiar story of Cinderella, her father recently remarried, and lamenting the misery of her new life with stepsisters and a step mother. The twist arrives when Ash falls in love with the King's respected Huntress Kaisa, after she has made a commitment to dark fairy prince Sidhean Plot summary Aisling, known as Ash to her friends, (pronounced Ash-Ling) is a teenage girl whose mother was once apprenticed to the local Greenwitch. Some time after Ash's mother dies, her father, a merchant, goes on a business trip and returns married to a woman with two daughters, the eldest of these is Ana who is Ash's age. Soon after they move in though, Ash's father becomes gravely ill, and instead of allowing the Greenwitch to care for him, Ash's stepmother takes him to the city to be treated by their Philosophers, who bleed him and cause his death, as the Greenwich warned they would. After her father's death, Ash's stepmother discovers he was deeply in debt, and sells Ash's childhood home to try and pay off some of his debts. The stepmother also declares that in order to earn her keep, Ash will serve as a servant in her home, as she has to lay off the rest of the staff because she can no longer afford to keep them. Ash's sole source of comfort is reading fairy tales by firelight each night. Ash wishes that fairies will take her away to their world where all her dreams will come true just like she once wished as a little girl. One night, the mysterious and sinister fairy prince Sidhean (pronounced SHEEN) finds Ash wandering through the woods on an enchanted path that connects Ash's new home to her old one, where her mother was buried. Sidhean warns Ash not to use this path and to stop seeking him out but Ash doesn't listen and seeks him out multiple times. Eventually Sidhean gifts Ash with a beautiful cloak and a pendant. but even though Ash begs him to keep her by his side in the faerie realm he always tells her it is not time. One day, Ash meets Kaisa‚Äîa noblewoman and the King's Huntress. Ash and Kaisa form an immediate and deep friendship, and eventually Kaisa teaches Ash to ride a horse and invites her to the King's Hunt. However, afraid that her stepmother won't allow her to go, Ash asks Sidhean for help and a disguise. Sidhean agrees but tells Ash there is a price to pay: if he grants her wish she will belong to him. Ash agrees, thinking it is her chance to finally leave her stepmother and enter the faerie kingdom. However, Ash begins to fall in love with the beautiful, strong Kaisa. Hoping to see her again, Ash asks Sidhean for another favor: to help her attend a ball at the castle, at which it is rumored the prince will choose his future bride. Sidhean agrees and gifts Ash a moonstone ring which Ash believes is magic, as she describes a feeling as if the ring binds her soul to Sidhean's. Sidhean also provides a beautiful blue gown and a coach for her to use to get to the ball, with a warning that it will only last until midnight. At the ball Ash unknowingly accepts a dance offer from the prince, and even though she doesn't know how to dance, she realizes her shoes and gown are enchanted to make her dance perfectly. While trying to get away from the prince, Ash runs into Kaisa who wants to know where Ash is getting all her fancy clothing and jewels since she knows Ash is a servant. Ash realizes that not only can she not tell Kaisa about Sidhean, but that she is now trapped, because fulfilling her promise to Sidhean will mean never seeing Kaisa again. She realizes that she has real feelings for Kaisa, and that Kaisa confesses she also has feelings for her. Ash leaves the ball later than she expected and her stepmother and sisters arrive home in time to see her still dressed in her magical gown and jewels. They accuse her of stealing and her stepmother cuts off Ash's hair, beats her and locks her in the cellar. Sidhean rescues her however, and tells her that he knew her mother when she was a young girl herself. He tells Ash that he knew her mother had magical powers and wanted to convince her to go with him to the faerie kingdom, but instead Ash's mother put a curse on Sidhean, to someday fall in love with a human girl so he could know the pain he had caused to other women who had fallen under his spell. Sidhean tells Ash she is the girl he has fallen in love with, but that he also senses her feelings toward him have changed. When her stepmother finally releases her form the cellar Ash learns her books have been burned, except for her mother's book of herbal spells which was hidden in Ash's coat. Ash hopes the book may have some kind of clue about how to break her deal with Sidhean, since she has now realized she doesn't want to trade her life and wants to stay in the human world with Kaisa. All she finds though are the words \\"the knowledge will change him\\" but is not sure this refers to Sidhean. Eventually Ash returns to the city with her stepmother and sisters who warn her she must stay in the house at all times. However, Gwen, a housekeeper Ash is friendly with, convinces her to sneak out for the Yule bonfire and Ash goes in hopes of seeing Kaisa. There Ash learns that the prince is to announce his choice of bride that same night and that Kaisa will be at the palace for the announcement. There Ash finds Kaisa and they share a dance as well as their first kiss. Ash explains that she has to leave to settle a debt and does not know if she will ever come back. Ash goes to meet Sidhean and tells him that if he truly loves her, he will release her and that she is only willing to spend one night in his world. Sidhean warns Ash that one night in his world is very different from a night in the human world, but Ash says she understands and Sidhean agrees to her terms. Ash asks if this means she will die and Sidhean responds \\"only a little.\\" The next morning, Ash returns to the house in the city to collect her things. She finds the room she was staying in ransacked, but thinks nothing of it, and even takes time to say goodbye to Clara, the nicer of her stepsisters, who informs her the prince did not choose Ana as his bride. Ash goes to the castle to find Kaisa whom she finds in the stables. Ash tells Kaisa her debt is settled, she is free and they kiss, with Ash promising never to leave again.

Originally 8063, it was renumbered 7002 after the original, claimed to be a land-speed-record-setter, was scrapped. It is the only survivor of its class and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Background  The E7s-class was created by replacing the slide valves above the cylinders on the E2a, E2b, and E2c-classes with piston valves. Unlike the E2, the E2a, b, c and subsequent E7s class used Belpaire firebox instead of a \\"radial stay\\" firebox.  History = Original  The original 7002 was an E2-class locomotive built in August 1902 by the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Works in Altoona, Pennsylvania. On June 15, 1902, the Pennsylvania Railroad inaugurated its new 18-hour train service from New York City to Chicago, the Pennsylvania Special --forerunner to the famed Broadway Limited. 7002 was coupled to the train as the replacement locomotive in Crestline, Ohio. Delays east of Mansfield caused it to depart Crestline 25 minutes late. 7002 was claimed to have achieved near Elida but this speed was based solely on two passing times recorded by separate observers at two different points (AY Tower and Elida) just 3 miles apart, and it is difficult to obtain even a general indication of a train's speed from signal box registers. (Speed on the East Coast Main Line p 69, by P Semmens). The train arrived on time in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It was scrapped in 1935.  Extant  8063 was an E2a-class also built in 1902 by the Altoona Works. It was upgraded to the E7s-class in 1916. 8063 was renumbered, altered to resemble 7002 and placed on exhibit as the \\"world's fastest steam engine\\" at the 1939 New York World's Fair and the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948-49\\\\. 7002 was transferred to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania from the Pennsylvania Railroad's historical collection in Northumberland, Pennsylvania in December 1979 by the Pennsylvania's successor Penn Central. 7002 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979. In 1982, 7002 was leased to and operated by the Strasburg Rail Road, mostly as a stand- in for their #89 which was undergoing a major rebuild for most of the 1980s. 7002 was mostly used on the half-hourly trains on the Strasburg but also two doubleheaded trips with PRR 1223 in the summer of 1985 to Harrisburg as well as a trip to Philadelphia on May 8, 1986. 7002 also ran between Hanover Junction and Gettysburg on November 19, 1988 to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's trip over the same route to make the Gettysburg Address. Both 1223 and 7002 were removed from service when the Strasburg Rail Road acquired an ultrasonic testing device in December 1989 and discovered that the metal sides of the locomotives' fireboxes were too thin to allow for safe operation. The locomotives were moved across the street, to the museum. Today, 7002 sits pilot to pilot with 1223 at the entrance to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania's Rolling Stock Hall.

Maps of the estimated amount of precipitation to have fallen over a certain area and time span are compiled using several different data sources including manual and automatic field observations and radar and satellite data. This process is undertaken every day across the United States at Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) run by the National Weather Service (NWS). A number of different algorithms can be used to estimate precipitation amounts from data collected by radar, satellites, or other remote sensing platforms. Research in the fields of QPE and quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) is ongoing. Recent research in the field suggests using commercial microwave links for environmental monitoring in general and precipitation measurements in particular.

Description This genus is provisionally included in the family Clavatulidae as the characters of the shell and the radula of this genus resemble more the characters of this family than those of the family Horaiclavidae. However, it differs from the other genera in this family by its weak columellar pleats and the multispiral protoconch in the Recent specie. However the extinct species type has a paucispiral, globose and almost smooth protoconch. This must then be considered an apomorphic character state. The fusiform shell is moderately small. The spire is relatively high and the base is contracted. The spire shows a peripheral cord with gemmules. The anal sinus is deep and its crest reaches the peripheral cord. The distinct columellar pleat is blunt.

Early years Daly learned the art of film editing from filmmaker Stuart Legg and documentary pioneer and NFB founder John Grierson, who had hired Daly in 1940 directly following his graduation from the University of Toronto. Daly was passionate about assisting in the NFB's war effort. Grierson was apparently taken with Daly‚Äôs intellect and bookish manner and brought him aboard as a production assistant, joking calling him ‚Äúthe best butler in the business,‚Äù an expression which would serve as the title for film scholar D.B.

He was also heavily involved in the multi-projector cinematic presentation In the Labyrinth, which eventually led to the development of IMAX. Daly was persuaded to put aside his studio responsibilities for a year and a half to edit In the Labyrinth. Daly also produced such works as Colin Low's Corral, Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor‚Äôs Lonely Boy, Koenig and Low‚Äôs City of Gold, Kroitor and Low‚Äôs Universe, Arthur Lipsett‚Äôs Very Nice, Very Nice, Robin Spry's One Man, and Gerald Potterton‚Äôs animated short My Financial Career. Daly also served as executive producer on Candid Eye, a 14-part cinema-v√©rit√© series made between 1958 and 1961.Khouri 2007, p. 36. Daly ran a mixed-discipline studio that included many of the most talented Canadian film- makers of the time, including an animation group with luminaries such as Norman McLaren, Don Arioli, and Robert Verrall; a documentary team including Roman Kroitor and Terence Macartney-Filgate.McInnes 2004, p. 135.

Paul Bartsch (1934) states the genus Polystira was created by W. P. Woodring in 1928 for certain large West Indian turrids. He named the largest of the recent species, generally known as Pleurotoma albida Perry, as type. Unfortunately, the mollusk so designated is not Pleurotoma albida Perry, which Perry states \\" is frequently found at New Zealand and Lord Howe Island.\\" Perry's figure 4, plate 32, of this species does not agree with the West Indian material. It clearly resembles certain shells from North Australia in the collection of the National Museum. The name is, therefore, not applicable to the West Indian shell, which will have to carry the next available designation. Lamarck in 1816, in his \\" Tableau Encyclopedique et Methodique \\", figured on plate 439, as figure 2, the West Indian shell without naming it. Wood, in 1818, in his \\" Index Testaceologicus \\", on page 125, names this species Murex virgo, referring to Lamarck's figure cited above. This appears to be the oldest available name for the type species. The type of Polystira Woodring must therefore be Murex virgo Wood = Polystira albida Woodring, not Perry.Bartsch, P.

Fossil records This genus is known in the fossil records from the Paleocene to the Quaternary (age range: from 55.8 to 0.781 million years ago). Fossils are found in the marine strata throughout the world. Fossilworks Distribution This marine species occurs in the Eastern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa); off Indonesia, New Caledonia, Panglao Island, Sulu Sea, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna, Bohol, Kerala, New Zealand, Philippines, Sea of Japan; off Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia). They are all know from deep waters from 100 m to about 1500 m, but usually at 200‚Äì700 m. Description The lines of specific distinction appear to be drawn narrowly in this genus and to depend chiefly upon sculpture. The novelty appears intimately related to Bathytoma engonia (Watson, 1881) Watson ‚Äî Journal Linnean Society, xv., 1881, p. 405 differing by the sharper keel, more elevated tubercles and generally coarser sculpture.Hedley, C. & Petterd, W.P. 1906. Mollusca from three hundred fathoms, off Sydney. Records of the Australian Museum 6: 211-225 The biconical or fusiform shell is medium-sized to rather large. Its periphery is smooth or nodose, angulate or keeled. The peripheral anal sinus is deep. The columella is somewhat swollen, sometimes showing a pleat. The paucispiral protoconch consists of 1 to 3 conical or globose whorls, smooth or with faint spiral striae. The operculum has a broadly oblanceolate to ovate shape, with an eccentric to terminal nucleus. The ground color of the shell is white to yellowish-brown.Kilburn R.N. (1986).

Description This genus resembles Daphnella in form and general appearance, but differs in having the protoconch spirally grooved instead of being obliquely reticulated. The contour is lanceolate rather than oval. The shell has usually more whorls, increasing less rapidly, with a longer and more turreted spire. The anal fasciole is usually more marked than in Daphnella, being more excavate, and crossed by sharp crescentic riblets. Some members of this genus have a superficial resemblance to Defrancia, under which genus they have been arranged. Hedley, C. 1922. A revision of the Australian Turridae.

Not to be confused with Daphnella Baird, 1850, a synonym of Diaphanosoma Fischer, 1850 belonging to the Sididae, a family of ctenopods. Description This genus is well characterised by a small, thin shell, elongate-ovate form, a sharp outer lip, the position of the sinus on the line of the advancing suture, and by the reduction of the siphonal canal. The protoconch has a sinusigerid (or diagonally cancellate) structure. The surface is usually striated. The spire is elevated, the body whorl is elongated. The early whorls of the teleoconch show a nodulous sculpture produced by strong axial riblets and strong spiral lirations. These axial riblets disappear on the body whorl, while the spiral lirations remain. The aperture is oblong- oval, slightly channelled in front. The columella is simple. The outer lip is slightly thickened in the adult. Hedley, C. 1922. A revision of the Australian Turridae.

This genus is closely related to Pseudodaphnella Boettger, 1895. They form together a genus-complex with a highly underestimated diversity, leading to intermixed clades. The lack of morphologic criteria requires the generic assignment of several species clearly to be reconsidered. Description The elongate, fusiform shell has a narrow aperture that is nearly half the length of the shell. The protoconch consists of two whorls. But only in a few species the sculpture of the protoconch is coarsely diagonally reticulate. The shell structure is reticulate with glossy nodules on the intersections of the ribs and lirae. The siphonal canal is short and wide. The U-shaped or linguiform anal sinus is deep, located near the suture and is surrounded by a thick outer lip. The outer lip is denticulate within. The columella is smooth.W.R.B.

Description (Original description by Verrill) As at present understood, this genus is intended to include those species which have a rather broad and very distinct subsutural band, crossed by excurved lines of growth corresponding to the form of the posterior sinus of the lip, which is situated a little below the suture and is always pretty well-developed, but is sometimes broad and shallow, and at other times narrower and very deep. The outer lip is always thin and sharp, without any appearance of a varix, nor is there any deposit of callus on the body whorl, in front of the aperture. The siphonal canal is well developed, generally constricted at the base and somewhat elongated, and usually but slightly curved. In a few of the species, doubtfully referred to hie genus, it is short and wide. The columella-margin is more or less sinuous. The protoconch differs in sculpture, and usually in color, from the rest of the whorls, and is generally minutely cancellated by fine raised lines running obliquely in opposite directions. The remaining whorls are elegantly sculptured by longitudinal ribs and revolving cinguli, and usually have a distinct shoulder or carina, which is frequently nodulous, below the subsutural band. The animal is destitute of an operculum, and, in all the species hitherto examined, is without eyes. The dentition consists of rather strong uncini, usually with a barbed tip and broad base. Verrill A. E. (1884). Second catalogue of mollusca recently added to the fauna of the New England Coast and the adjacent parts of the Atlantic, consisting mostly of deep sea species, with notes on others previously recorded. Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 6(1): 139-294, pl. 28-32 (Description by Dall) The larval shell is multispiral. The adult shell shows a small blunt protoconch of several (usually) swollen whorls, closely arcuately axially ribbed. This protoconch is dark and sculptured with criss-cross lines, strongly contrasting with the rest of the shell. The succeeding short-fusiform whorls have an axial and (fainter) spiral sculpture. The anal sulcus is close to the suture, deep and wide, with a distinct fasciole. The siphonal canal is very short, narrow, recurved. The outer lip is thin, simple and sharp. The columella is thin, gyrate, anteriorly obliquely truncate, almost pervious. The animal is blind and lacks an operculum W.H.

The outer lip is simple, showing fine wrinkles. This section differs sharply from Daphnella through the deep V-line. It is also related to the European section of Cordieria Monteros and to the fossil group Homotoma Bell. The coloring is almost always a mixture of white and reddish yellow or reddish brown. As a type species the author takes Pleurotoma philippinensis.O. Boettger, Die marinen Mollusken der Philippinen (IV) nach den Sammlungen des Herrn Jos√© Florencio Quadra in Manila. IV. Die Pleurotomiden (Schluss.); Nachrichtsblatt der Deutschen Malakozoologischen Gesellschaft 27 (1895) (Description by Charles Hedley) The size is rather large. The colour may be various shades of brown or yellow, disposed often in dots on a white, sometimes opaque, ground. There is a small brown mucronate apex of two or three whorls, the first spirally engraved, the next with oblique lattice lines. The adult shell is netted over by elevate spirals and radials enclosing deep oblong meshes. At the points of intersection are small sharp cusps. The aperture is wide and free from tubercles or plications on the columella side, and generally without a varix. The sinus is subsutural, broad, and shallow. There is no fasciole band distinguishable. Distribution Species of this genus occur in shallow waters of the tropical Indo-Pacific and Australia. The genus is associated with reef corals, and has a habit of sheltering under loose stones between tide marks.

Distribution  This genus occurs in European waters, in the northern part of the Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Verde, West Africa and Angola.  Taxonomy history  The genus Raphitoma was created in 1847 by Luigi Bellardi (1818-1889) in his \\"Monographie des Pleurotomes fossiles du Pi√©mont\\" for species in different groups without operculum.Bellardi L. ‚Äî Monographia delle Pleurotome fossili del Piemonte. Monographie des Pleurotomes fossiles du Pi√©mont p. 612 Raphitoma now contains many species formerly assigned to Pleurotoma Lamarck, 1799, Clathurella (Carpenter, 1857) and Philbertia (Monterosato, 1884). Philbertia was synonymized with Raphitoma in 1990 because Dr. Philippe Bouchet did not consider valid the subdivision of species into different genera solely on the basis of differences during larval development.Marco Oliverio, \\"Gastropoda Prosobranchia\\", Biol. Mar. Mediterr. (2008), 15 (suppl.): 235-278Bouchet P., 1990. Turrid genera and mode of development: the use and abuse of protoconch morphology. Malacologia, 32: 69-77. In describing Raphitoma, the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) relied on an unpublished database \\"Nomenclator of Molluscan Supraspecific Names\\" by Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P. (2010). In December 2011, the WoRMS database still showed 21 species retaining the genus name Philbertia. In their publication \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea (Gastropoda)\\", Bouchet, Kantor et al. (2011) still recognize Philbertia as a valid genus in the Raphitomidae.Bouchet, Kantor et al. (2011), \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea (Gastropoda)\\" As of the 2017 update to the 2005 restructuring of gastropod taxonomy, WoRMS recognizes Philbertia as a synonym of Raphitoma. Description According to Giannuzzi-Savelli et al. (2018), the shell of the species in this genus are characterized by: * shape: turreted to biconic- pupoidal with an impressed suture. * size: small to medium (5 mm to 25 mm) compared with the other genera in this family * protoconch: 3 to 4.5 whorls when multispiral (planktotrophic development) - otherwise paucispiral (lecithotrophic development) - this dichotomy of the larval development between sibling species can be used in distinguishing them). * body whorl: frequently keeled. * Sculpture: reticulate and diagonally squarely cancellated with the axial opisthocline ribs broader than the spiral riblets; sometimes growth lines visible between the ribs on the body whorl. * outer lip: thickened, showing inner denticles; crenulated externally. * columella: simple; sometimes slightly sinuous anteriorly. * siphonal canal: funnel-like; short to rather long; wide. Data about the soft parts are scarce and suggest a variation between the species.Giannuzzi-Savelli, R., Pusateri, F. & Bartolini, S. 2018.

Description (Original description) The diagnosis that Cossmann previously provided in support of Bellardiella does not apply - as we have seen above - to the genotype which is a typical Clathurella. It remains to name the shells which, like Pl. textilis, are not true Daphnella, because of their more twisted and shorter siphonal canal, their more elongated spire, and their narrower aperture in front. This group absolutely deviates from Clathurella because of its thin outer lip, its very deep sinus, its unpleated columella, so that there is only a distant analogy in ornamentation.

Description The large, thin shell is nearly destitute of sculpture. It shows an unrecurved columella, a short, wide, straight siphonal canal, a wide shallow emargination representing the anal notch, and generally feeble anal fasciole, except in the very young. There is a sharp outer lip, unarmed aperture, and a sinusigera protoconch. The animal has a muzzle formed by a stout squarely truncated rostrum opening into a capacious pharynx, provided internally with a degenerate proboscis not capable of extrusion beyond the oral orifice, with a poison gland and a degenerate radula. Eyes are present and functional. The tentacles are low-seated, stout, and clavate. The operculum is absent. The dentition resembles that of Bela. This form resembles Pleurotomella, Verrill, from which it differs in the character of the rostrum and pharynx, in the possession of eyes, in its straight wide siphonal canal, and in having a feebler type of verge, anal notch and fasciole.

Description (Original description) The protoconch is large, with 1¬Ω depressed whorls, spirally and longitudinally striated from the initial portion onwards, the spiral striae developing into well-defined sulcations as the shell passes from the brephic to the neanic stages of growth. The shell as a whole is elongate, the aperture being much longer relatively than, the spire. The whorls are slightly convex and spirally sulcated throughout, the lines of growth well-marked. The suture is typically canaliculate. The aperture shows a thin, erect, outer lip, constricted posteriorly, and broad towards the anterior. The columella is plain, with a thin deposit of callus through which the sulci appear. It is difficult to satisfactorily classify this genus. By its general configuration it has considerable analogy with Daphnella, but may be easily differentiated by the unique characteristics of the protoconch, and the absence of a posterior sinus. The last-mentioned circumstance might be taken advantage of to remove Teleochilus from the Pleurotomidae, did we not know that the possession of a sinus is not an absolutely necessary qualification for inclusion in that family. In some respects Teleochilus recalls certain forms of Mitra, but it has no columellar plications, nor even the semblance of a fold. Whilst its protoconch is distinctive. At the same time, it approaches the genus Dilaphus, Philippi, which, although deprived of folds on the columella, is classified with the Mitridae, chiefly on anatomical grounds. The soft parts of the animal were first described by Mr. A. Garrett, who was unable to detect any difference between them and those of Cylindra, Schumacher. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ascertain the relationships of Teleochilus in the same manner, as its soft parts are denied to us. On conchological considerations alone it is included in Pleurotomidae, and may be assigned a position in the neighbourhood of Daphnella.Harris, G.F. 1897.

Description (Original description) This genus has been created by Melvill in 1917 for a series of deep-water species of Clathurella with several peculiarities. The small, thin, delicate shell has a pale brown or white, fusiform spire, either very attenuate, or pagodiform, or broader, and ventricose, always much suturally impressed. The shell contains 10-12 whorls with 4-5 whorlsin the protoconch. The first of these is smooth, the second to the fourth or fifth are very finely longitudinally radially costulate. The remainder are either few or closely ribbed, crossed by frequent or more distant lirations, acutely echinate at the points of junction, interstices appearing deeply seated, almost smooth, quadrate or oblong. The aperture is oblong. The outer lip is thin. The sinus is deep and wide, situated immediately below the suture. The siphonal canal is produced and fusiform.Melvill J.C. (1917).

It is essentially a field with an apartness relation. A commutative ring is a Heyting field if ¬¨(0=1), either a or 1-a is invertible for every a, and each noninvertible element is zero. The first two conditions say that the ring is local; the first and third conditions say that it is a field in the classical sense. The apartness relation is defined by writing a # b if a-b is invertible. This relation is often now written as a ‚â† b with the warning that it is not equivalent to ¬¨(a=b). For example, the assumption ¬¨(a=0) is not generally sufficient to construct the inverse of a, but a ‚â† 0 is. The prototypical Heyting field is the real numbers.

Early life and family Woodbridge's father, William Woodbridge, was a Yale University graduate, minister, and a major advocate for educational change in Connecticut. The senior Woodbridge wrote textbooks on grammar and spelling, and was the first preceptor of Phillips Exeter Academy. He worked with his son on some of the younger Woodbridge's projects. His mother was Ann Channing, the aunt of Bostonian Unitarian theologian William Ellery Channing. William Channing Woodbridge was born in Medford, Massachusetts. His family soon moved to Connecticut, where his parents taught him Latin, Greek, chemistry and mathematics. Throughout his life, he suffered from what was then called scrofula, which today would probably be diagnosed as tuberculosis. Career at Yale In June 1808, Woodbridge entered Yale as the youngest member of his freshman class. Here, he was inspired by Yale College's president, Timothy Dwight IV. Woodbridge developed an interest in both the American landscape and in the publication of geographies, and was a member of the Society of Brothers in Unity. Many of the values later reflected in his publications were those of Yale at this time. Woodbridge was a true son of the Enlightenment, believing in the importance of reason and observation. However, like Dwight he remained a committed evangelical Christian. Woodbridge rejected the Unitarian ideas which were then influencing so many of his friends and relatives. He believed passionately in science, but he was certain that this knowledge of the material world could only lead people closer to God and to a firmer morality. He believed in the essential unity of all humans. After discussing the location of the various races of mankind, his 1830 edition of Rudiments of Geography reminds readers, ‚ÄúThe scriptures inform us that all of these races are brethren of the same family; the children of the same first parents.‚Äù  Teaching the deaf  Upon graduation, Woodbridge briefly attended Princeton University with the hope of studying theology and becoming a missionary. When ill health made this impossible, he turned to teaching. Eventually, he accepted a position as an instructor with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet at the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Hartford, Connecticut. Here, he pioneered in teaching geography to the disabled. Woodbridge also began work on a small geography text which would eventually be published as Rudiments of Geography.Walters 1993, p. 42-43.Alcott 1858, p. 54-55.Walters, William D. Jr: ‚ÄúWilliam Channing Woodbridge: Geographer,‚Äù page 42-47, The Journal of Social Studies 16 & 17: 2, 1993.Woodbridge, William Channing: \\"The Rudiments of Geography, on a new plan designed to assist the memory of comparison and classification: with numerous engravings of manners, customs and curiosities, and accompanied by an atlas\\", Hartford: S. G. Goodrich, 1921. Travel to Europe Isothermal chart of the world created in 1823 by Woodbridge using the work of Alexander von Humboldt. In October 1820, Woodbridge left his teaching job and traveled to Europe. He was desperate to improve his health and keen to meet prominent European educators and visit their schools. He also wanted to gather material for an expanded geography. He traveled via Gibraltar and Algeciras to Palermo, Livorno, and Rome. He returned to Hartford in July 1821, where he began writing a new and greatly expanded geography that would incorporate what he had learned in Europe. It was eventually published 1824 as A System of Universal Geography.Woodbridge, William Channing: \\"A System of Universal Geography, Ancient and Modern, on the Principals of Comparison and Classification\\", Hartford, Oliver D. Cooke and Son, 1824Walters 1993.Alcott 1858. The book would remain in print, with small variations in title, until 1866. Second trip to Europe For Woodbridge, understanding European thinkers was critical to improving American education. In the fall of 1824, he left the United States for a second and more extended trip across the Atlantic. The small amount of money he earned from books was insufficient to support even his very humble lifestyle. Therefore, he supplemented his earnings by teaching the disabled.Walters Jr, William D: ‚ÄúWilliam Channing Woodbridge: Geographer,‚Äù page 44, The Journal of Social Studies 16 & 17: 2, 1993 For all of his admiration of European educators and geographers, he decided they were behind the United States in two areas: female education and teaching the disabled. Woodbridge spent the summer of 1826 teaching in Hofwil, Switzerland, where Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg had established an influential experimental school. Woodbridge was in Paris in January 1827, correcting proofs of his new geography textbook. He had made the acquaintance of the great German explorer, scholar, and student of physical geography Alexander von Humboldt. Woodbridge continued to correspond with von Humboldt and incorporated many of von Humboldt's ideas in his geographies. In the introduction to his new geography text he thanked von Humboldt and the Geographical Society of Paris for their assistance.Walters 1993, p. 44-45.Martin, Geoffrey J: ‚ÄúThe Emergence and Development of Geographic Thought in New England,‚Äù page 1‚Äì13, Economic Geography 74, March 1998. Woodbridge then went back to Hofwyl, probably sometime in 1828, before returning to New England in 1829.Alcott 1858, p. 55. Work to improve music education While on his second trip to Europe, Woodbridge observed the teaching of vocal music by N√§geli, Pfeiffer, K√ºbler and others, and brought home many of their works with him.\\"Educational Labors of Lowell Mason\\", The American Journal of Education, p. 139-147, 4, 1857. Upon his return to Hartford, he began working with Elam Ives, Jr. to see those Pestalozzian-based teaching methods applied. Their experiment was apparently successful.Ellis, Howard Eber: \\"The Influence of Pestalozzianism on Instruction in Music,\\" (Doctoral dissertation), 1957, p. 142-145. Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (5801396) During this same time, Woodbridge had gone to Boston and met Lowell Mason, whom he persuaded to go and observe Ives' experiments in Hartford.Gilsig, Marcie-Ann: \\"Elam Ives, Jr. (1802-1864): Musician-Educator\\" (Doctoral Dissertation) Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (ML31197), 1985, p. 19-20 Woodbridge left Hartford in 1830 and discontinued his relationship with Ives. Instead, he supported Mason (who‚Äîat least initially‚Äîadopted many of his imported methods) through the Boston Academy of Music, of which he was the corresponding secretary.Pemberton, Carol Ann: \\"Lowell Mason: His Life and Work\\" (Doctoral Dissertation) Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (7128272), 1971, p. 178-179. His promotion of Mason through lectures in Boston and through his American Annals of Education eventually helped Mason win support to introduce music education into the Boston public schools, a feat which William Alcott would say was \\"a service which alone would have made him a public benefactor.\\" Work with William A. Alcott It was in Hartford, in the spring of 1830, that Woodbridge met William A. Alcott. Alcott would later remember the meeting, writing that he had entered a tavern, just as Woodbridge was leaving. He asked the publican who that was and was told that it was William Channing Woodbridge, who was a great friend of education. Alcott followed Woodbridge down the street and introduced himself. He was astonished when Woodbridge responded to the introduction with a question; \\"what is the great practical error in all of our school education?\\" Without hesitation, Alcott replied that it was,‚Äùthe strange effort to crowd the intellect at the expense of health, morals, and everything else.‚Äù These words, Alcott wrote, ‚Äúbound as friends for life.‚Äù Alcott, William A: \\"Confessions of a Schoolmaster\\", (reprinted by New York Arno Press in 1969) 1856 By 1831, Woodbridge had shifted his base of operations from Hartford to Boston. The first joint effort of Woodbridge and Alcott was the publication of an improved educational journal. In 1831, Woodbridge purchased the American Journal of Education, which was renamed the Annals of Education.Jorgensen, E.R. (1984) \\"William Channing Woodbridge's Lecture \`On Vocal Music as a Branch of Common Education' Revisited.\\" Studies in Music, 18, 2. Over the next five years Alcott and Woodbridge contributed many articles and textbook reviews to the Annals. Woodbridge and Alcott filled the Annals with a wide range of articles on educational topics, reflected on developments in Europe, and pressed for educational reform. They were particularly concerned with women's education and with incorporating the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and the French reformer Joseph Jocotot into American schools, both of whom had stressed the importance of observation and of geography. By the time hard times swept away their control of the Annals in 1836, its reputation as the leading American educational publication was firmly established.Walters Jr., William D: ‚ÄúVoices for reform in Early American Geographical Education\\", p. 156-160, Journal of Geography 86:4, July‚ÄìAugust 1987.Alcott 1858, p. 59-60. Publication with Emma Willard For some time Woodbridge had also been associated with Emma Willard. Together they worked on many geography texts. Their complex publication efforts had begun in the early 1820s. When both were growing up, their families lived within five miles of each other in Connecticut. Both shared a passionate interest in causes like educational reform and the education of women. Because it had originally been intended to publish Woodbridge's Rudiments of Geography with an early geography by Willard, and because Willard's Ancient Geography was eventually published with Woodbridge's work as Universal Geography, there was considerable confusion about the role of each author. Emma Willard had to publicly assure readers that the ‚Äúsystem of modern geography‚Äù had been entirely written and arranged by Woodbridge.Woodbridge and Willard, 1827. Their various combined geographies proved to be very successful. By 1827, they had reached an arrangement to pool and split royalties; Woodbridge would get five sevenths of the money and Willard would receive two sevenths. This seems to have reflected their relative contributions. Woodbridge seems to have done most of the updating as well as handling many of the financial arrangements with the publishers. Throughout Woodbridge's life the two authors remained on cordial terms.Walters Jr., William D: ‚ÄúEmma Willard‚Äôs Geographies,‚Äù p. 118-138, Pennsylvania Geographer 37, Spring/Summer 1999. Kim Tolley has recently argued that the Woodbridge and Willard geographies, with their strong emphasis on field work and observation, were important in encouraging American women to develop an interest in scienceTolley, Kim: \\"The Science Education of American Girls: A Historical Perspective\\", New York, Rutledge Palmer, 2003 and Daniel H. Calhoun has made the case for their importance in the world view of Americans in the Jacksonian era.Calhoun, Danliel A: \\"Eyes for the Jacksonan World: William C. Woodbridge and Emma Willard\\", Journal of the Early Republic 4, 1984 Publication of On the Best Methods of Teaching Geography In 1834 Woodbridge presented and later published ‚ÄùOn the Best Methods of Teaching Geography.‚Äù This is almost certainly the first extended discussion geographic education written by an American. The need for such an effort reflected the growing importance of geography in American schools. In his essay, Woodbridge argued that simple memorization of names was insufficient; each word had to be supported in the student's mind by a clearly defined concept. The active use of maps was essential because those being taught had to see places in relation to each other. He felt that the small amount of knowledge that could be acquired in a classroom was not of much practical use to travelers, explorers, soldiers or missionaries; the real importance of geography was to lead the students outside his own limited experience and to learn to see themselves as part of a larger human family. The well-taught student of geography, he argued, should learn to wonder without condemning and to smile at some new experience without contempt.Woodbridge, William Channing: ‚ÄúOn the best Methods of Teaching Geography, Lectures Before the American Institute of Instruction\\", page 209-240, Boston American Institute of Instruction 1834 Legacy in authorship By modern standards, Woodbridge's books are small. Rudiments of geography, one of the smallest, was only six by three and a half inches (15 x 9 cm). The same illustrations were often used in several different books, as they were expensive to create. In content, Woodbridge's geographies stress several common points. He saw physical geography as more important than human, simply because it was less likely to change. He introduced many European ideas about the planet to American audiences. In his discussions of the human condition in various regions, Woodbridge emphasised that the human condition in any part of the globe is primarily the product of access to education and opportunity. Climate, religion, and the nature of governments played some role, but he had no place for the racial slurs that were to disfigure so many American textbooks of the second half of the nineteenth century. He regarded the way in which societies treated and educated women as a useful measure of their degree of enlightenment. His geographies, like almost all of the schools they were intended for, were overtly Christian, but could never be mistaken for religious tracts. Maps were Woodbridge's passion. Often his text would begin with the student's home or classroom and work outwards to the wider world.Bruckner, Martin: \\"The Geographic Revolution in Early America: Maps literacy and National Identity\\", Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press, 2006. He was a member of the Geographical societies of Paris, Frankfurt and Berlin, scanning their pages for new information. Geoffery Martin has called Woodbridge, ‚Äúone of the most reliable mapmakers of his time.‚ÄùMartin 1998, p. 3. This is ironic because some modern readers are struck by the relatively few number of maps in some of his works; this is often because many were bound and sold together with a small atlas. These atlases, which usually command higher value in the antique market than the texts, have often been separated from their original companions. Personal life In 1832 Woodbridge married Lucy Ann Reed, who had been an assistant teacher in Marblehead, Massachusetts. He actively campaigned for improvement in the Common schools of Massachusetts. He became a leader in the ‚ÄúSociety for the Relief and Improvement of the African Race.‚Äù Throughout the 1830s and early 1840s he continued to expand, update, and revise his textbooks. In particular, over time, there is a noticeable improvement in the number and quality of maps and illustrations. In addition to constant sickness, Woodbridge spent most of his life in near poverty. Income from one book was often used to improve the next and he was unable to resist an appeal from anyone in need. In search of improved health and for new information for his geographies, Woodbridge returned to Europe in 1836. His young wife eventually joined him there, but died in Frankfurt in 1840, leaving Woodbridge with the care of their two small children. He traveled to Berlin for the winter of 1841-1842 and then returned to Boston. His health continued to deteriorate, and hoping that a more tropical climate would relieve his symptoms, he spent the last three winters of his life in St. Croix, in what was then Danish Territory, but is now part of the United States Virgin Islands. An illustration the 1847 edition of his Modern School Geography shows Woodbridge working in his study there with a map on the wall and a shelf of books (p. ix). William Channing Woodbridge died in Boston in 1845 and is buried in Marblehead, Massachusetts.Alcott 1858, p. 60-64.

He was born in August 2, 1947 in Philadelphia to a Navy family and travelled a lot as a child. It was not until high school that he finished a year in the school he started. Literary career After a career in government, Shepherd sold his first published writing to the science fiction magazine Analog. It was a short story called \\"Summer Hopes, Winter Dreams\\" and appeared in the March 1991 issue. His short story \\"A Day's Work on the Moon\\" was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novelette in 2000. Shepherd has written about one book a year. His first three books, the Lost Millennium series (First Dawn in 1996, Second Fire in 1997, and Lost Days in 1998) had a combined sales of just over 20,000 copies, so his editor suggested that he switch genres, to military science fiction set in the future. His next three books, the Society of Humanity series (The First Casualty in 1999, The Price of Peace in 2000, and They Also Serve in 2001) sold better, at over 10,000 copies each, but not as high as was hoped. To make a fresh start for his next series, his editor suggested that he write under a new pseudonym. His third and ongoing series, published as \\"Mike Shepherd\\", covers the exploits of Kris Longknife, a rich young naval officer who struggles to deal with the expectations and reputation of her famous family of military leaders, politicians, and billionaires. The first book, Mutineer, was published in 2004 to greater success than his previous books. In a review for Tor.com, Liz Bourke described the series as \\"pure fluff\\" of the good kind, that is, intellectually lightweight but \\"entertainingly sticky, full of implausible successes, assassins, fleet actions and daredevil do-or-die gallantry\\". His contract with Ace Books expired in 2016, ending a 2 decade relationship, and in 2017, he founded his own independent publisher, KL & MM Books, to continue publishing his works, especially the Society of Humanity fictional universe works.

The album produced one single, \\"Out of Work\\" which peaked at #21 on the Billboard Pop Singles charts.www.garyusbonds.com[ www.allmusic.com] According to the liner notes on the Razor & Tie reissue, after recording the album, Columbia Records had Bruce Springsteen remove his vocals from the tracks, specifically from the track \\"Angelyne\\", so Van Zandt stepped up to record the duet instead. Because of this, although Springsteen can still be heard on several of the tracks, he is not credited in the original liner notes. Additionally, the liner notes state that three other songs were recorded for the album but not present on the final release including Springsteen's \\"Action In the Street\\", \\"Lion's Den\\", and \\"Savin' Up\\".On the Line album liner notesbrucebase.wikispaces.com Springsteen's version of \\"Lion's Den\\" was eventually released in 1998 on his boxset Tracks and \\"Savin' Up\\" appeared on Clarence Clemons' first solo album Rescue (1983); \\"Action in the Street\\" remains unreleased.

Known formerly as the University of Colorado Student Union (UCSU), CUSG creates, implements and oversees a $24 million budget generated by student fees and self-generated revenue for the operation of CUSG Cost Centers. CUSG also serves as the liaison between the student body and University Administration. Three branches, an executive, a legislative and a judicial are governed by the student-adopted Constitution. Mission as Enshrined in the CUSG Constitution WE, THE STUDENTS of the University of Colorado Boulder, exist not only as individuals, but also as a community. Our purpose is to unify the student community by establishing the responsibilities and goals of CUSG governance. In order to improve the administration of student affairs and to encourage the greatest level of cooperation and communication, and to ensure the optimum of students‚Äô rights, and to provide the best possible excellence in education we do establish the University of Colorado Student Governments' Constitution. Executive Branch Executives, elected by a popular vote, lead the executive branch. Two or three students are elected to serve as the executives, they may adopt various structures pursuant Article II Section A of the CUSG Constitution, \\"The Executive or Executives shall consist of either a Chief Executive and an Associate Executive, three Tri-executives, or some other designated form.\\" http://cusg.colorado.edu/sites/default/files/page- uploads/Constitution%20April%202012.pdf Together they act as the student body executive branch, serving the students as the chief spokespeople to the community and the University Administration. The Executives are elected each spring for one-year terms. The Executives also appoint an Executive Cabinet; these cabinet members serve for a one-year term in conjunction with the Executives, and help to implement and execute the goals of the elected administration. Executive Staffers are appointed by the Executives, and ratified by the CUSG Legislative Council. Legislative Branch The Legislative Branch, called Legislative Council, is CUSG's policy-making body. Legislative Council has final approval over the CUSG budget and the programmatic operation of all Cost Centers and CUSG services. There are two equal houses to Legislative Council, Representative Council and the Council of Colleges and Schools (CCS). Representative Council is composed of nine popularly elected Representatives who serve one-year terms; five Representatives are elected in the fall and four in the spring. The Council of Colleges and Schools has nine seats, one for each college and school on campus. CCS Senators are elected by their constituent colleges and schools, while some are appointed. Each school has only one vote. Legislative Council elects a Legislative Council President and Vice President to preside over the body. Joint and Advisory Boards Working with Legislative Council is a group of eight Joint Boards and Advisory Boards that provide oversight for several of CUSG's Cost Centers and operations. Joint Boards act as boards of directors, governing and supervising each Cost Center's management structure. The Joint Boards include the Recreation Board, the Health Board, the University Memorial Center (UMC) Board, the Air Board, the WRC Board, the Environmental Center Board, the Cultural Events Board (CEB) and the Finance Board. Finance Board is unique in that it does not oversee a single cost center, but manages student fees and creates the annual budget. Each Joint Board is led by a chair, elected internally by the board and subject to ratification by two-thirds of Legislative Council. Overseeing the everyday operations of the CUSG Cost Centers is a major responsibility for the student government. Cost Centers include the Student Recreation Center, Wardenburg Health Center, University Memorial Center (UMC), Environmental Center, Student Organizations Finance Office (SOFO), Women's Resource Center (WRC), Off-Campus Student Services (OCSS), Student Legal Services, Cultural Events Board (CEB), Volunteer Resource Center, KVCU Radio 1190 and the Student Outreach & Retention Center for Equity (SORCE). In conjunction with the Executives, each Cost Center submits a yearly student fee budget to Finance Board for final consideration and inclusion in the next fiscal year's student fee. Judicial Branch The Judicial Branch performs the judiciary function for CUSG and is known as the Appellate Court. Seven justices serve on the Appellate Court, led by a Chief Justice and an Associate Chief Justice. The Appellate Court has the final adjudicating authority over questions of the CUSG Constitution. Justices are appointed by the Executive and subject to ratification by a two-thirds vote of Legislative Council. The Appellate Court has the final authority on questions of constitutional interpretation for the CUSG when such questions are submitted by any student. All decisions by the Court are binding and valid on all affected parties. The Finance Board The purpose of the Finance Board is to make recommendations to appropriate University authorities about the level and distribution of student fees and about the designation of activities to receive student fee support, hereinafter referred to generally as cost centers. In making its recommendation, the Finance Board‚Äôs ultimate standard is the welfare of the University and in particular the welfare of the student body. Since its special area of responsibility is fiscal, the board has the obligation to develop and maintain policies and procedures which assure a responsible level of management and review of student fee funds, not only of funds under its direct control (student fees), but also of funds allocated to any area incorporated under the Autonomy Agreement. Student fees are monies collected according to a rate schedule set by the Regents from student designated kinds of student-oriented activities, which, by state or University policy, can be financed only partially, if at all, from state appropriations, tuition, or other funds available to the University. The Finance Board is charged with preparing the Annual Student Fee Budget, with Recurring Allocations Subject to the approval of the CUSG Legislative Council and the Regents; The Finance Board also determines the annual budget for student fee supported operations, including the level of the student fees and the rate schedule, the identification of activities which merit continuing fee support, and the establishment of the level of such support for recurring allocations. Elections and Controversial Issues The number of candidates that ran in the Spring 2010 University of Colorado Student Government (CUSG) election more than doubled from Spring 2009 because of controversial issues being tackled by the current administration, according to student government members, who said more competition could mean more voters. The Spring elections in 2011 were narrowly won by candidates running on the INVEST ticket, a conservative leaning ticket with several incumbents, which beat out EDGE and PROPEL the two progressive tickets, who won a combined 55 percent of the vote. In Spring of 2012, the progressive PULSE ticket brought progressive candidates back into power after two conservative administrations, defeating the ENTRUST ticket by 15 percent. In the Spring 2013 elections, the Tri- Executive candidates from the UNITE ticket narrowly won by 22 votes. http://cusg.colorado.edu/content/spring-2013-election-results-cusg The Spring 2016 elections were controversial for CU Student Government. Originally, the entire Revolution ticket was disqualified due to allegations ranging from bribery for fraternity and sorority votes by pizza to illegal tabling. When appealed, only two members of the Revolution Ticket, Colton Lyons and Marcus Fotenos, were disqualified by the CU Student Government Appellate court. However, due to flaws in the election infraction process, the Chancellor of CU-Boulder Phil DiStefano overturned the ruling and reinstated Fotenos and Lyons.http://cuindependent.com/2016/05/10/university-overturns-cusg-appellate- court-ruling-reinstates-cusg-presidents-elect- revolution/http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_29762954/allegations-bribery- harassment-mar-cu-boulder-student-government Notes Category:University of Colorado Boulder Colorado ","title":"University of Colorado Student Government"},{"id":"26961793","text":"was an amusement park located in the town of Misaki in Osaka Prefecture, operated by Nankai Electric Railway Co., Ltd.

To the Vietnamese the mountain is the center of a myth about B√† ƒêen, a local deity of Khmer origin. During the Vietnam War the area around the mountain was very active as the Ho Chi Minh Trail ended a few kilometers west across the Cambodian border. As such there were many battles and American and Vietnamese soldiers based in the region remember the prominent landmark. After the war the mountain turned from a battleground to being famous for its beautiful temples and theme park. Geography and fauna aerial view, 1971 At , the extinct volcano rises from the flat Mekong Delta jungle and farmland. The mountain is almost a perfect cinder cone with a saddle and a slight bulge on her northwest side. The mountain is honeycombed with caves and is covered in many large basalt boulders. The mountain is located approximately 10 km northeast of T√¢y Ninh and 96 km northwest of Ho Chi Minh City. A species of gecko, Gekko badenii, is named for the mountain and is endemic to the mountain.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Baden\\", p. 14). History alt=Buddhist temple Pre-Vietnam War Variations of the legend of N√∫i B√† ƒêen exist. The oldest Khmer myth involves a female deity, \\"Neang Khmau\\" who left her footprints on the mountain rocks. The Vietnamese myth centers around a woman, B√† ƒêen, falling in love with a soldier and then through betrayal or suicide B√† ƒêen dies on the mountain. It has special significance to the Vietnamese Buddhist population and has a famous shrine about two thirds of the way up the mountain. Also, to the Cao Dai sect the mountain has special religious significance and its temple, the Tay Ninh Holy See, is close to the mountain. During World War II the mountain was occupied by the Japanese and it was occupied by the Viet Minh, the French and the Vietcong. Vietnam War View from the top of the mountain c. 1967 or 1968 Nui Ba Den radio relay site, 21 March 1970 The Mekong Delta is generally a flat region with the exception of the Black Virgin Mountain. The mountain commands everything in its sight and was therefore a strategic location for both sides during the war. In May 1964 the mountain top was assaulted by the Special Forces 3rd MIKE Force and the peak was held by American forces with the 121st Signal Battalion establishing a radio relay station, callsign Granite Romeo Tango, there in February 1966. Supplied by helicopter for much of the war the Americans controlled the top and the Vietcong controlled the bottom and surrounding foothills. The base was occupied by over 140 Americans when on the night of 13 May 1968 the base was attacked and overrun by the Vietcong. By 02:30 on 14 May the Vietcong had been driven off by gunship and artillery fire. The results of the attack were 24 U.S. killed, 2 U.S. MIA and 25 Vietcong killed. In January 1969 the mountain was extensively searched by 1st Brigade elements of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry, 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry, and tanks from the 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor. In the tunnels that honeycombed the mountain they found arms caches, and engaged Vietcong units stationed on the mountain. Throughout the war the Vietcong returned to the mountain and its cave bases. Colonel Donald Cook was the first Marine captured in the Vietnam war. For a time he was held near Black Virgin mountain. In early December 1974 heavy combat in T√¢y Ninh began, with PAVN rockets falling on the province capital and on adjacent military installations. The 80-man 3rd Company, 314th Regional Force Battalion guarding the radio relay station on the summit of Nui Ba Den began receiving attacks of increasing intensity and frequency. Helicopter resupply and evacuation had become impossible, and although the company commander reported sufficient food and ammunition, water was running very short and several severely wounded men required evacuation. PAVN assaults on Nui Ba Den continued throughout December 1974, but the RF Company held on. RVNAF efforts to resupply the troops on Nui Ba Den were largely unsuccessful. Helicopters were driven off by heavy fire, and fighter-bombers were forced to excessive altitudes by SA-7 missiles and antiaircraft artillery. One F-5A fighter-bomber was shot down by an SA-7 on 14 December. Finally on 6 January 1975, without food and water and with nearly all ammunition expended, the company picked up its wounded and withdrew down the mountain to friendly lines. Tourist attraction alt=Cableway going up a mountain The mountain is famed for its beautiful views and temples. Visitors may hike up trails but many people take the N√∫i B√† ƒêen gondola lift to the top of the temple complex. Many of the trails up the mountain are dangerous when wet.

At the 2016 census, Cabarlah had a population of 1,075.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  Geography  Cabarlah is approximately north of the Toowoomba city centre and has an area of approximately 20 km¬≤. It is situated on the Great Divide with views to the east of the Lockyer Valley through to Brisbane and to the west across the Darling Downs. Traditionally the area has been used for farming however in recent years the expansion of the Toowoomba Regional Council has led to acreage and other residential development. History In the 1860s to 1883 the area was called Five-Mile Camp. The name Cabarlah was used after Crows Nest railway line (from Toowoomba to Crows Nest) was built. It is thought that the name Cabarlah derived from an Aboriginal expression describing the ring- tailed possum. However, a 1930 newspaper article claims it is a ‚ÄúNative name of the mountains in the neighbourhood‚Äù. The Queensland Government set aside land for the Geham Cemetery (now the Cabarlah Cemetery) on 11 September 1878. Trustees were appointed on 2 January 1880 with the first burials occurring in 1881. Cabarlah Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 (a receiving office had been open from 1884). The Cabarlah Community School opened in Wirraglen Road, Highfields, in January 2006. It used the Reggio Emilia teaching philosophy. In March 2008 it was closed when the Queensland Government's Non-State Schools Accreditation Board refused to accredit the school, claiming it did not meet the requirements of the Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001. Although the school appealed the decision, the Queensland Education Minister, Rod Weldford, upheld the board's decision.  Military history  The Borneo Barracks are west of the New England Highway at Cabarlah (). The barracks were originally established as a World War I training area. Since the Second World War, Cabarlah has also had a significant role as a base for the Australian Army. It was home to elements of the 7th Brigade early in the war. Later in the war it became a hub for signals and other training. Cabarlah is now home to the 7th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) and other Australian Defence Force signals facilities. St Martin's Anglican Church was opened at the Cabarlah Barracks in 1959 but closed circa 1961. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,075 people in Cabarlah. 83.6% of people were born in Australia and 93.2% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 26.3%, Catholic 22.5% and Anglican 18.2%.  Facilities  The Cabarlah Golf Club is located at Borneo Barracks. It is open to the public, but visitors must present their drivers licence for identification to enter the site. The Cabarlah Cemetery is located at 10148 New England Highway (). It is operated by the Toowoomba Regional Council.  References Further reading * Jeffrey Richelson and Desmond Ball. The ties that bind: intelligence cooperation between the UKUSA countries.

This term is applied to housing in South Asia built of substantial material such as stone, brick, cement, concrete, or timber. The term pucca means \\"solid\\" and \\"permanent\\", from Hindustani / pakkƒÅ, . It is contrasted with kutcha housing (/ kaƒçƒçƒÅ ), referring to buildings of flimsy construction. Pucca homes are typically made of concrete, stone, clay tiles and/or metal, in contrast to older homes made of mud and organic material. These building methods are more costly and labor-intensive than the more traditional building methods. In India, there is currently a large-scale effort to build pucca houses for people. The organization Indira Awas Yojana was created to help the rural poor throughout the country, by providing them with pucca houses. 267,543 houses were constructed under IAY during 2009. Pucca houses are sometimes built to replace homes damaged by natural disasters.The permanency of pucca materials and techniques inevitably makes it less easy to adjust the house to the needs and habits of the occupants. Through puccafication, the relationship between house and occupants becomes more rigid, more fixed.

Carney Triad (OMIM 604287) including gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma.Carney JA. \\"The triad of gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and functioning extra-adrenal paraganglioma: a five-year review.\\" Medicine (Baltimore). 1983;62(3): 159-169. The underlying genetic defect remains elusive. CT is distinct from Carney complex, and the Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Background Carney triad (CT), named for J Aidan Carney, is considered to be a specific type of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). The three classically associated tumors are a subset of gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (it is now known that this subset is actually gastrointestinal stromal tumor arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal), pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma. The condition manifests more commonly in females. Multiple tumors in multiple organs in young patients, with occasional sibling involvement, suggested an inherited disorder, but the underlying genetic basis has not been identified. In addition to these three classical tumors, there is an increased incidence of pheochromocytoma, esophageal leiomyoma and adrenocortical adenoma.Stratakis CA, Carney JA.

J Intern Med. 2009;266(1):43. The original description employed the then- prevailing terminology of gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma.

However, there is limited evidence to suggest that the gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in Carney triad lack CD117 (c-kit) mutations (i.e., they are wild-type), and hence these GISTs may prove unresponsive to Imatinib.Diment J, Tamborini E, Casali P, Gronchi A, Carney JA, Colecchia M. \\"Carney triad: case report and molecular analysis of gastric tumor.\\" Hum Pathol. 2005;36(1):112-6.

The club was formed in 1950 and has played in the first division among other leagues in Mexico. On April 2016, Real Zamora defeated Sporting Canamy 2-0 to clinch a spot for the Ascenso to the Liga Premier de Ascenso against UAT B, after that Zamora defeated UAT B and earned the promotion to the LP. History=C.D. Zamora The club was founded on December 26, 1950 and quickly joined Mexican Second Division along with Zacatepec, Monterrey, Toluca, Deportivo Irapuato, Zamora, Quer√©taro, Morelia and Pachuca. Some clubs were newcomers, and some were rejoining the league. In their first league, the club quickly became a contender and finished a couple of points behind the champion Zacatepec, who earned the chance to join the Primera Divisi√≥n de M√©xico. The following years were also successful years, but not good enough to crown themselves. In the 1954-55 tournament, the club once again finished runner-up, this time just behind F.C. Atlas;, this time the club was allowed to be promoted after the federation decided to increase the number of clubs in the top division to 14. A playoff tournament was organized with 2 clubs from the first division along with the 11 and 12 place clubs from the first division clubs: Cuautla FC, Zamora, Quer√©taro, Atlante and Marte. With the result of Atlante remaining in the top division, joined by Cuautla FC and Zamora. Quer√©taro remained in the second division, joined by the relegated Marte. In the 1955-56 season the club played its first tournament in the top league under the management of the Enrique √Ålvarez.The club had a terrible time in the top division and so lost the category, being relegated back to the second division, leaving its spot to C.F. Monterrey, who had been promoted. In the 1956-57 season, the club finally won its first title led by the Argentine Ra√∫l Leguizam√≥n. This time the club took over the empty spot left by C.F. Monterrey, who a year ago had taken over the spot Zamora had left. That same year Puebla FC decided to leave the league, and so its spot was taken over by Atl√©tico Morelia, marking this the first time 2 clubs from the state of Michoac√°n played in the top division. The club once again lost the category in the 1959-60 tournament after playing 3 not-so-good tournaments, with its best season finish in 1957-58, finishing 7th with 25 points. In 1960 the club finished last under the management of Carlos Seville. The club would not return to the first division, having 2 good opportunities one in 1963-64 when they played a promotion matched against Cruz Azul who would beat them 7-1. The club would eventually be relegated to the third division where they would win the 1977-78 title to return to the second division where in 1982-83 tournament they would have its second opportunity to return to the top division facing Uni√≥n de Curtidores in a second promotional match which they lost 1-0. Another Teams A second division team returned to Zamora in 1989-90, when Cachorros Guaymas moved to the city. In this season, the club won the Segunda Divisi√≥n \\"B\\" and was promoted to Segunda \\"A\\". In 1990-91 was relegated to Segunda \\"B\\", in 1994 was dissolved. The club has played on and off since 1994 until 2004, when was created a new team called Jaguares de Zamora, a Chiapas inferior reserve squad. In 2007 the club became once again independent and rejoined the Segunda Divisi√≥n Profesional until 2008. In 2010, the club returned with the name Atl√©tico Zamora in Second Division, playing in Liga de Nuevos Talentos, this team was dissolved in 2011, its franchise was moved to Cuernavaca to compete in the Liga Premier de Ascenso. Real Zamora In 2008 a club called Real Zamora was created in the Third Division. Real Zamora was created from the license of Real Cavadas, who played at La Piedad, in 2008-09 season, the team played with Real Cavadas register. As of the 2009-10 season, the team got its name officially. In 2013-14 season, Real Zamora reached the final of the championship, the team was defeated by Tuzos Pachuca. The status as runner-up allowed the team to be promoted to the Liga de Nuevos Talentos. In the Apertura 2015 tournament, Real Zamora was runner-up of Liga de Nuevos Talentos, the squad was defeated by Universidad Aut√≥noma de Tamaulipas.. However, in Clausura 2016, Real Zamora won the tournament by defeating Sporting Canamy by a 4-1 aggregate score. The squad won the right to play the promotion playoff against Universidad Aut√≥noma de Tamaulipas, Real Zamora won the series by a 7-1 aggregate score and was promoted to Liga Premier de Ascenso. In 2016-17 season Real Zamora was promoted to the Liga Premier de Ascenso, with this achievement, the club and the city council collaborated to resume the construction works of the Estadio Zamora with the aim of fulfilling the guidelines of the Second Division. On October 1, 2016, Real Zamora played its first game in the stadium. The team played its first three games in the Estadio Juan N. L√≥pez, La Piedad. In June 2017, the former footballer Heriberto Morales acquired 30% of the club's shares through the Promotora Valladolid. However, he sold his participation a year later. In July 2018, Jos√© Trinidad Melgoza, who was part of the board of the Reboceros de La Piedad, decided to move the project of the mentioned club to join him with the Zamora's team, including footballers and coaching staff, and he went on to be a majority partner in addition to taking the vice- presidency of the team. With the arrival of Melgoza to the administration, a Real Zamora's reserve squad was created, this team plays in Tercera Divisi√≥n, however the reserve squad participate in this season with the Queseros de San Jos√© register. In December 2018, Melgoza returned to La Piedad board, with this fact Real Zamora and Reboceros de La Piedad started an exchange of players and coaches between both teams with the aim of uniting their projects and promoting the development of football in the region. On June 28, 2019 it was announced that the team's franchise was put on hiatus during a season due to the breach of the sports infrastructure required by the Liga Premier de M√©xico - Serie A, the period without activity was reserved to make the necessary improvements to comply with the regulation and thus qualify for promotion to a higher category.

Appearance The original statue was roughly high, although its garments and the superstructure that support them bring the total height to . It is a carved and painted wooden statue of the Virgin and Child, richly dressed in Baroque style. The eyes on the face look downward. According to Jes√∫s Abades, it is made of birch wood. On the back of the sculpture is the legend \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios\\" (\\"Our Lady of Remedies\\"), believed to be the original name of the statue, before it became known in the 15th century as Santa Mar√≠a de las Rocinas (later del Roc√≠o). The statue is not realistic; rather, it is abstract and theological. Mary is represented specifically in her role as the mother of Jesus, her eyes looking down toward the child, contemplative. Garments The Virgin's garments do not date back as far as the statue itself. The tradition of dressing such devotional images dates largely from the late 16th and early 17th century. There is documentary evidence of garments for the Virgin as early as 1631, though those would not be the same garments as those used today; indeed some changes to the Virgin's garments can be specifically documented.El Vestido de la Virgen del Roc√≠o, hermandadrociosevilla.com. Retrieved 2010-04-15. For example, the present cloak dates only from 1952.El Manto de la Virgen del Roc√≠o, hermandadrociosevilla.com. Retrieved 2010-04-15. The clothes use rich fabrics and extensive brocading, but are of generally simple cut. On either side are flowers. Origin and modifications Many scholars have expressed views on the date and authorship of the Virgin of El Roc√≠o, but without reaching any clear consensus. Jos√© Alonso Morgado y Alonso, who gave the first rigorously scholarly description of the statue in 1882, believed it to be a 13th-century work, with important modifications in the early 15th century that gave it a Gothic aspect. According to Morgado, it was further modified in the 17th century when it was richly garbed in the Baroque style of the era. Jos√© Mar√≠a V√°zquez Soto, writing in 1997, essentially endorsed this view, although he believes hathat the clothes date from the 18th century, based on their style. Sevillian historian Jes√∫s L√≥pez Alfonso also believes that the figure dated from the second half of the 13th century. Juan Infante-Gal√°n Zambrano related the statue to a Saint Anne venerated in a church in Triana, which would also match this date. The painter Santiago Mart√≠nez, writing in 1949, believed that the face was the original, and that the original work is generally well preserved from the waist down. However, according to Mart√≠nez, other than the face, the upper half was significantly altered to add the clothing and the figure of the Christ child. Historians Juan Miguel Gonz√°lez G√≥mez and Manuel Jes√∫s Carrasco Terriza, both from Huelva and the latter the designer of the current altarpiece of the Hermitage, date the original statue between 1280 and 1335. According to Gonz√°lez and Carrasco, the statue is of French origin. They further write that the custom of dressing the statue (though possibly not in its present garb) must date back at least to 1605, based on a drawing from that date; they date this custom from the late 16th or very early 17th century. Further, they date the hands, the Christ child, and the downcast eyes of the Virgin from roughly the same time as the clothes. Several recent scholars have pointed to strong stylistic resemblances to the work of Jorge Fern√°ndez Alem√°n (late 15th and early 16th century) or of the Flemish sculptor Roque Balduque (mid-16th century). Jes√∫s Abades largely endorses the views of Gonz√°lez and Carrasco. In his view, the Virgin of El Roc√≠o is originally French or Central European. He agrees that it is \\"mutilated\\" from the waist up (with a framework for its garments replacing parts of the original). Following Jos√© Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez, he dates the subsidiary figure of the Christ child to the 18th century. He considers it likely that the statue underwent significant restoration in the early 16th century, which would be consistent with the theory of involvement by Fern√°ndez Alem√°n.

It was originally named Agaricus djamor by the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius and sanctioned under that name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. It was known by many different names before being transferred to the genus Pleurotus by Karel Bernard Boedijn in 1959.  Properties  The flavor of the pink oyster mushroom has been described as meaty and fishy. Just like most mushrooms it is quite umami. Its texture is both meaty and chewy. When fried until crispy, it resembles bacon or even ham. However, when it is raw, it has a sour taste. The pink oyster mushroom, unsurprisingly has a pink color. When cooked, however, the color quickly fades. It has a curly cap which is 2 - 5 cm in diameter. The caps are also quite thin. The stem is very short or even non existent. The reason why it is very rare to find in supermarkets is that it has a shelf life of only about a day. Since it is only harvested from spring to fall, it is only available during that time.  Uses  Pink Flamingo oyster mushrooms are best suited for cooked applications such as saut√©ing, boiling, roasting, or frying. They can be saut√©ed or stir-fried with other vegetables, added to pasta dishes, sprinkled on top of pizza, added to grain bowls, saut√©ed with eggs, boiled in soups, chowders, or stews, or cooked into risotto. They can also be saut√©ed and mixed with cream-based white sauces for added flavor. Due to their meaty texture, these mushrooms require thorough cooking to develop their flavor and an edible consistency. Pink oyster mushrooms pair well with coriander, parsley, mint, basil, garlic, ginger, onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, bell pepper, red cabbage, broccolini, baby corn, leeks, quinoa, noodles, rice, and potatoes.

December 1, 1978) was an early pioneer in the field of occupational medicine, and was the first director of the Environmental Cancer Section of the National Cancer Institute, holding that post from 1938 to 1964. He is best remembered as one of the inspirations for author and environmental scientist, Rachel Carson. Early life Hueper was born in Schwerin, Mecklenburg,Larry Agran, The Cancer Connection (NY, St. Martin's 1977), p. 173 Germany to an impoverished family.Devra Davis, The Secret History of Cancer (Basic Books, 2007) Ch. 4, page 74-75 As a young man, he was drafted to fight in World War I, and dodged the chemical residue of poison gas blowing back on German troops. Initially, he was an infantryman, but later became a medic for an infantry battalion. He was a self-described pacifist because of this experience and reading books like \\"Nie Wieder Krieg\\" (Never War Again).Agran, pp. 173-174 After the war, he completed medical school of Rostock University in 1920 and then emigrated in 1923 with his wife to the United States.,Agran, p. 174. He was employed for six years as a pathologist at Loyola Medical School in Chicago. In 1933, he returned to Nazi Germany to look for work during the Depression. However, he quickly returned to the United States in 1934, having been shocked witnessing the chaotic state of Germany at that time. He also was appalled at the degraded condition of German science, including the use of human experimentation.Devra Davis, The Secret History of Cancer (Basic Books, 2007) Ch. 4, page 74-75. He returned to the United States and produced a series of early publications on occupational causes of cancer. Research into the causes of cancer Accepting a position as pathologist at the DuPont-funded Haskell Laboratory of Industrial Toxicology, Hueper recognized that certain industrial dyes were causing bladder cancer in DuPont workers, including benzidine and Œ≤-Naphthylamine.David Michaels, \\"When Science Isn't Enough: Wilhelm Hueper, Robert A.M. Case and the Limits of Scientific Evidence in Preventing Occupational Bladder Cancer,\\"International Journal of Occup. and Environ. Health, 1 (1995) pp. 278-288. Hueper warned them explicitly of dangers to their workers in 1937, and throughout 1938.Ibid., Agran, at p. 175 DuPont was unappreciative of this information, and Hueper left because of DuPont's efforts to censor and block publication of what Hueper had learned. In fact, DuPont continued to censor and undermine Hueper's efforts to publish on environmental causes of cancer through back channels throughout the remainder of his lifetime.Devra Davis, The Secret History of Cancer (Basic Books, 2007) Ch. 4, page 37-38David Michaels, \\"When Science Isn‚Äôt Enough: Wilhelm Hueper, Robert A.M. Case and the Limits of Scientific Evidence in Preventing Occupational Bladder Cancer\\", International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health\\" Vol. 1, No. 3 (1995), pp. 278-288. Hueper also was one of the first scientists to try to educate the public regarding the carcinogenicity of asbestos. He tried to disseminate this information to the public in 1950 through a twenty-page NCI publication on environmental cancers.Asbestos: Medical and Legal Aspects, Fifth Edition, by Barry I. Castleman (Mar. 2005)Devra Davis, The Secret History of Cancer, pp. 100-101. However, perhaps bowing to pressure from industry, the NCI would later refuse to publish an update of this pamphlet, leaving Hueper disillusioned and alienated.Id. Despite the efforts of the chemical industry to halt Hueper's efforts to study and publish on environmental cancer causation, he may have ultimately been indirectly one of the major influences on the environmental movement. Dr. Hueper's most publicly remembered role may have been to influence Rachel Carson, the author of Silent Spring. In her book, Carson credited Hueper with being the first person to recognize the connection between pollution, occupationally-used chemicals and cancer.Devra Davis, The Secret History of Cancer, pp. 77-78. Dr. Hueper tried throughout his career to bring attention to corporate efforts to disguise and hide occupational cancers caused by chemicals. His 1942 work \\"Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases\\" is recognized as the first medical textbook listing cancers and their occupational causes. He is the author of over 300 medical articles, editorials, chapters of books, and books on occupational and environmental cancer. Toward the end of his life he was interviewed by Barry Castleman, to whom he said of the struggle against environmental cancer, \\"This is a war just like any other war, and it will be fought with every dirty means.\\" Asbestos: Medical and Legal Aspects, Fifth Edition, by Barry I.

In India the plant is found in the mangrove forests of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Sundarbans and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Traditional practices in these regions use the leaves and rhizomes as medicine; and the seeds are poisonous and used as bait to kill dogs and wild animals. Description The plant is a twining shrub with stout glabrous branches, root-stock thick, and fleshy; roots thick. Leaves are simple, opposite, 3-6x2-4.5 cm, ovate or oblong, thick and fleshy, acute or obtuse at apex, rounded at base. Inflorescence cymose. Flowers small, starry, crowded, in axillary corymbose cymes, 2‚Äì3 mm across; corolla purplish, lobes pubescent inside. Follicles brown, 4‚Äì5 cm across, sub-globose; seeds are many and flattened. Cotyledons often large, radicle terete. In the mangroves of India it is often found in association with and climbing on Phoenix paludosa. Flowering and fruiting occur during June‚ÄìSeptember, October‚ÄìJanuary, respectively. In Andhra Pradesh fruiting is recorded as early as during August‚ÄìOctober. Chemical constituents S. globosus is a rich source of flavonoids, rotenoids and phenolyc glycosides.Wangensteen H, Alamgir M, Duong GM, Gr√∏nhaug TE, Samuelsen AB, Malterud KE (2009). Chemical and biological studies of medicinal plants from the Sundarbans mangrove forest. In:Advances in Phytotherapy Research (M Eddouks, ed). Research Signpost,Kerala, India, pp. 59-78. Rotenoids such as tephrosin, 12aalpha-hydroxydeguelin, 11-hydroxytephrosin, 12a-hydroxyrotenone, 12aalpha-hydroxyrotenone, 6aalpha,12aalpha-12a-hydroxyelliptone, 6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin, and 13-homo-13-oxa-6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin, villosinol and 6-oxo-6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin are identified. Isoflavones like barbigerone, genistin and a chromone 6,7-dimethoxy-2,3-dihydrochromone were identified. The isoflavone sarcolobone and the rotenoid sarcolobin were isolated from the stem and are unique to the species. Four phenolic glycosides including vanillic acid 4-O-beta-d-glucoside, glucosyringic acid, tachioside and isotachioside are reported. Uses=Poison S. globosus is listed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as poisonous plant. The seeds are known to be highly toxic to mammals. Native people of Asia widely use it to kill dogs and wild animals. It was demonstrated that it effectively killed cats. The plant extract causes inhibition of the neuro-muscular system. The symptoms of poisoning in animals include blood urine and nephrosis.Radostits OM, Arundel JH, Gay CC (2000). Veterinary Medicine: A textbook of the diseases of cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and goats (10th edn). Saunders Ltd., p. 1684. Medicine The plant has been used as an herbal medicine for treatment of rheumatism, dengue and fever. The plant is known to contain barbigerone which is validated to have significant antioxidant property, highly effective against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and with anti-cancer potential as it causes apoptosis of murine lung-cancer cells.

Various patents including advanced features have been published intending to replace traditional metallic and plastic license plates. The electronic license plate has a complex design that works directly with the vehicular computer system and can communicate with outside sources that may remotely access it for the regulation of vehicle use.  Concept  Inventor Dean L. Naddeo published a patent on June 11, 2002 for the improvement of existing license plates. Naddeo's intention was to create further uses of traditional license plates to maximize their capabilities. Electronic license plates are claimed to be more efficient in lowering crime, lowering cost, and replacing other forms of identification (such as algorithms) through the introduction of electronic monitoring. Electronic license plates would also help increase state revenue, since plates could flash or display a message when the driver has not registered their car or is driving without being insured.  Features  The electronic license plate can offer additional features as compared to the traditional license plate. The plates may function as more than just an identification sign; they may also give information, be used for prepaid services, and provide a more beneficial form of security.  Information  In accordance with privacy regulations, one may reference information from an electronic license plate only for legal purposes. Very specific information can be acquired dynamically via a remote vehicle's plate and this could be as specific as the vehicle's speed and position. Such information is useful for patrolling highways, to reduce speed violations, and to increase safety. Simpler information such as the vehicle identification number (VIN), registration expiration date, proof of insurance, and legal ownership records could be displayed digitally on the plate's screen or be viewed using a remote device.  Prepaid services  Electronic license plates allow certain transportation-related fees and services to be prepaid digitally and updated automatically. Vehicle registration is the primary service that can be renewed instantly. Parking permits can also be associated with the electronic license plate and can be monitored remotely. Toll fees can be prepaid because the license plate can communicate with the global positioning system (GPS) to set up routes, calculate the cost of travel, and send the signal for payment as it passes through a toll booth.  Security  Because they can reduce the chances of a criminal fleeing a scene if a vehicle is in an accident or associated with a crime, electronic license plates can improve security. In these situations, the plate would emit a signal of collision or crime, directly identifying the vehicle's involvement. If not identified at the scene, the license plate holds the information in memory and displays a digital alert. The advanced technology in electronic license plates enables surveillance tools to automatically receive a clear signal with robust information instead of attempting, after the fact, to capture a potentially distorted image.  Design  Similar in size to the traditional license plate, the electronic license plate has a digital display measuring , which is set into a rectangular housing. The display is powered directly from the vehicle's power system and can communicate with the vehicle's on-board computer. The internal components fit inside the housing and are set together in circuits critical for the functions of this technology.  Internal Components  * Central Computer System - processing unit; gathers and sends out information to external sources; sends information for display on the license plate's screen * Memory Chip (key) - integrated circuit; stores information (e.g., vehicle registration, identification numbers, state of issue, expiration date) and restrictions * Identifying Key - tamper-proof hardware; records vehicle identification information for that unique vehicle * Disabling Unit - sensor; if tampering is detected, sends a signal to the central computer system and ignition disrupter to disable the vehicle * Ignition Disrupter - electronic component connected directly to the vehicle's ignition system; does not allow vehicle to be turned on when tampering is detected  External Components  * Display - illuminated screen hardware; enables various digital displays, including license plate number, state of issue, expiration date, etc.  Privacy  Privacy concerns are a major reason electronic license plates are not yet in public use. Since hacking and identity fraud are potential risks, in-depth testing and development of data security is required. In accordance with consumer privacy laws, information from the electronic license plate will be sent out only when the vehicle is involved with any violations or illegal activities. The device is now made with tamper-resistant hardware to prevent information from being acquired by unauthorized parties. The vehicle can be disabled automatically if any tampering is sensed; for example, the unauthorized removal of its electronic license plate will disable the vehicle, thwarting vehicle-identity theft. Tampering to avoid payments or as part of another crime will result in an automatic alert to law enforcement, lowering risk for both the consumer and third parties.  Future  Two states in the US are exploring improvements over traditional license plates. The governor of California has set up California's Electronic License Plate Pilot Program, which will test such alternatives. In 2017, California expected to issue electronic license plates to a limited number of volunteers to test this new technology. The main reason for California's interest in electronic license plates is to reduce taxpayers' expense. Digital plates are projected to reduce $20 million spent by the Department of Motor Vehicles. South Carolina has also shown interest in electronic license plates, and has set up its own pilot programs. https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliewalmsley/2019/01/24/these-customizable- digital-license-plates-will-be-in-8-states-by-year-end/#3c2b46b20d17 References Category:Vehicle registration plates Startup plans digital license plates.

The hill is the highest point within the city limits, with an elevation of 2600 ft. There is a temple of Vetala located on the top of the hill from which the hill derives its name. The Indian Forest Department maintains an observation deck near the temple. The hill is also known by its Marathi name, Vetal Tekdi. Location and physiography Vetal Hill is a part of Bhamburda Van Vihar located on the western side of Pune Municipal Corporation within the city limits. Vetal Tekdi is prominent and is visible from Pashan, Panchavati, Chatturshrungi and other parts of the city. It has two spurs, Fergusson College Hill and Chatturshrungi Hill. The geographical area is 180 30‚Äô to 180 32‚Äô N and 730 49‚Äô to 730 52‚Äô E covering an area of . It runs North-South with some spurs running perpendicular to this hill. Vetal hill runs across areas like MIT College, SNDT Women's University, ILS Law College, Gokhale Nagar, Symbiosis Society and Chatturshrungi.. There is one access road leading up the hill from the south. This can be used to access the Automotive Research Association of India campus located on the hill. There is a public parking lot also located along this road, however access is restricted to this between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm. Vetal Hill Panorama, the summit is in the centre. Climate A small forest fire on a hot summer day in Vetal Tekdi Summers are hot and dry on the hill. The summit is difficult to climb during the monsoon season and is usually foggy. Winter days are also cool and foggy. Sunrise and sunset at Vetal hill attracts many photographers. The area shares almost same climatic conditions as that of Pune. Flora The forest type in this area is dry-deciduous as that of hills around Pune. Medium-sized trees along with shrubs constitute majority of the vegetation. Diversity of herbaceous species is at its peak in monsoon months. Some parasites like Dendropthoe and Striga are also reported in the area. One important characteristic of the area is total absent of epiphytic species. Detailed Floristic Study of Vetal Hill was carried out by V. N. Joshi and M. S. Kumbhojakar of Agharkar Research Institute, Pune in 1997. They enumerated occurrence of 416 species of angiosperms belonging to 101 families, 2 pteridophytes and one Bryophyte. Much before Joshi and Kumbhojkar‚Äôs work, ecological survey of the hill was conducted by Ezekiel around 1917-1918. Joshi, Kumbhojkar and Kulkarni in their work on changing floristic pattern of Vetal hill (1992) reported absence of 30 species which were reported by Ezekiel. The dominant plant community in the area is Boswellia serrata- Anogeissus latifolia. Other dominant members of this area are Dalbergia lanceolaria, Acacia chundra, Dolichandrone falcata, Albizzia procera, Capparis grandis. Some herbaceous and shrubby weeds which are now naturalized in the area include Tridax procumbens, Lagascea mollis, Cassia uniflora, Lantana camara. Plantation of some exotic species like Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala has been undertaken by forest department. Dalbergia melanoxylon is one interesting example for spread of exotic species. This species was planted by Britishers in Pune University area. This species was totally absent on other areas of Pune. Recently however, the species is observed to be spreading in and around the area of the Vetal Hill, and is on the verge of becoming dominant species there. The area is important on account of the occurrence of some important endemic species. Some examples of the endemic species found here are Jatropha nana, Cissus woodrowii, Mussanda laxa, Indoneesiella echioides, etc. Current status During the last few years the area has been subjected to various stresses of anthropogenic activities. Plantation of exotic species by forest department, urban development, tree cutting are few of them. Many afforestation programs have been undertaken either by Pune Municipal Corporation or by state forest Department have resulted in growth of many ornamental and exotic species. The Forest Department has also build proper fences to safeguard animals and birds especially peacocks also providing them with appropriate water supply. This has affected in some or other way on the natural vegetation of the hill. A new road connecting Balbharati and Paud Phata is proposed so as to decrease traffic pressure in Nal Stop Chowk. The road will cut across a nearly two kilometre patch of forest on vetal hill, cutting close to ten thousand fully matured and grown trees. The proposed bypass will bring automobile pollution, noise and congestion into the heart of a green area at the foot and lower ridge of the Vetal hill. This is a catastrophic proposal and will destroy one of the last virgin green areas left in Pune. Several citizen groups and activists have opposed the proposal. Twelve NGOs recently wrote a letter to the PMC opposing the road. A blog and an online petition was promoted to stop the construction of the road. Nagrik Chetana Manch has gone to the Mumbai high Court in a PIL and the HC has stayed the construction of the road. Due to increased urbanization and increased population the biotic pressure in the form of cutting of trees has increased on forest of Vetal Hill.

Life and career Little is known about Ida W√ºst's early childhood. She discovered early the world of theater, and decided to make it her career. After attending secondary school in Frankfurt am Main, W√ºst took acting lessons from Thessa Klinghammer and at the age of 16 received her first engagement at the StadtTheatre of Colmar, and further stage productions in Bromberg, and in 1904 performed extensively in Leipzig. In 1907 she became a member of the ensemble of the Lessing-Theater in Berlin, where she performed roles in Hosenrollen (roles in which women impersonate men in trousers), and comedies and became sought after actress.Index Stummfilm She befriended and married actor Bruno Kastner, with whom she began writing screenplays. The couple married in 1918, divorced in 1924, and had no children. W√ºst appeared in the four-silent serial installments of Tragedy of Love and The Countess of Paris in 1923, which also featured a young Marlene Dietrich. Many other silent movies quickly followed and W√ºst's film career of the silent era was prolific. She transitioned to the sound era of the talkie with relative ease and appeared in many stage and film production during the 1930s. World War II brought a slump in W√ºst's career. During the war years she played in only several film and theater roles. Following the war, W√ºst's 1946 request for denazification was dismissed because during the Nazi regime, she was accused of denouncing fellow actors such as Eduard von Winterstein. W√ºst was known to have corresponded with Adolf Hitler throughout the war years and several of her letters to Hitler are on file at the Princeton University Adolf Hitler Collection.Luck Find Gazette Only in 1949 was W√ºst classified as suitable to resume her career. During the 1950s, she made several films, often appearing as sprightly elderly ladies and comedic matronly types. Also, during the 1950s, she again returned to the stage. During her career, Ida W√ºst appeared opposite some of the most notable stars of the German cinema, such as: Heinz R√ºhmann, Hans Albers, Peter Lorre, Paul Henckels, K√§the Dorsch, Hans Moser, K√§the Haack, Paul Kemp, Theo Lingen and many more.

He was well known by his contemporaries for his simple lifestyle and asceticism and unflinching adherence to priestly purity rules. Most of his life is said to have been spent in prayer. Kukadaru was also an astrologer of some repute. He was renowned for his spirituality, in particular his healing and divination. He is also reported to have prophesied several events (including the death of certain people, including Empress Victoria. Due to orthographic differences between English and Gujarati he is also referred to as Dasturji Jamshedji Ervad Sohrabji Kookadaru Saheb and numerous other variations. Dasturji and Ervad are both honorific titles relating to his position as a priest. Rather confusingly he has the title Dasturji and Ervad, which are different priestly 'ranks'. This is unprecedented, in his lifetime Kukadaru was only an Ervad a medium-level 'mere ritual priest' not befitting the title of Dastur which was granted after his death by the noted priest Jamasp-Asa at his Uthamna (Zoroastrian funeral prayers). The title Saheb give to him is another honorific, translating as 'master', it is often used in the Indian Subcontinent in reference to 'spiritual masters' like the Sikh Guru Granth Sahib'. Lifestyle of Dasturji Kukadaru Kukadaru was born on 26 May 1831 in Surat, Gujarat, India. The day as per the Zoroastrian calendar was Yazdegerdi Mah (month) Ava, Roj (day) Zamyad. Kukadaru moved from Surat to the larger city of Bombay, to work as the (priest) of Kapawala Agiary (Fire-Temple) at Nizam Street, Baharkot. Kukadaru Saheb lived a simple life including washing his own clothes and eating only one meal a day which consisted of rice and ghee (clarified butter). This meal woulf be cooked by keeping a vessel of rice in the rays of the sun and reciting sacred Avestan verses. He did not eat meat, and only consumed milk and fruits.Ervad Burjor H. Antia, Zarthoshti Anjuman Atash Bahram A Book celebrating the 100 years of its enshrinement, Anjuman Atash Bahram  The Miracle of the Gold Bar  Several miracles were performed by Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb, and the most famous one was the Gold Bar miracle. Dasturji Saheb transformed an ordinary brick into a large bar of gold by praying the ancient Avestan prayers throughout the night. This was on request of the Zoroastrian devotees to cover a shortfall in the construction money for the Anjuman Atash Behram building at Dhobi Talao (Mumbai, India). The sum of Rupees 10,000 was raised by selling the transformed bar of gold, a handsome sum of money in the 19th century. Even today, an amazing lifelike portrait of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb is placed in the hall of the Atash Behram, and similar portraits of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb are placed in most of the Parsi Zoroastrian Atash Behrams and Agiaris (Fire Temples) in the Indian subcontinent. Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb also cured people of diseases by praying the Avestan scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion.  Posthomus fame in the 20th Century  Kukadaru died on 4 January 1900 on the Yazdegerdi calendar day Behram in the month of Fravardin.Michael Stausberg and Ramiyar P. Karanjia, \\"Kukadaru, Jamshedji Sorab,\\" Encyclopaedia Iranica Online, 23 June 2008, available at www.iranicaonline.org. Many years after Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb had died, Ervad Nadarsha Navroji Aibara who was a well-known priest of Cusrow Baug, Colaba, (Mumbai, India) was responsible for rekindling the faith in Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb among the Parsi Zoroastrian community in India and overseas. Ervad Nadarsha Navroji Aibara was born in 1933, which was a number of years after Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb died. Ervad Aibara‚Äôs spiritual Guru (mentor) was Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb, and Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb‚Äôs spiritual Guru was the more ancient Dastur Azar Kayvan Bin Azar Gushasp Saheb.Dr. (Mrs.) Hilla Minoo Wadia (2003), Late Ervad Nadarsha Navroji Aibara Blessed by Sant Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb, Kukadaru Trust  Mazagon Navjotes  Mazgaon Navjotes, Parsi Prakash, Vol. 3, page 41.Dasturji Kukadaru was reported to have participated in the Mazgaon Navjotes. In 1882, a group of poor dock workers living and working in the Mazgaon Docks appealed to various priests and also petitioned the Bombay Parsi Panchayet (BPP) to be admitted as Parsi Zoroastrians, despite being born of mixed Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian parentage. Some 200 prominent Parsis collected funds and eminent priests (including Kukadaru and Jamaspji Minocherji,) performed the Navjote ceremony, in the presence of a large gathering on 26 June 1882. At the time it was said this act of generosity brought \\"prestige to the community\\". Eleven navjotes were performed of 4 males and 5 females, adults with ages ranging from 35 years to 77 years as well as two children. The two children of 5 and 2, were considered too young to undergo the ritual. It was understood that all of the initiates had male Parsi parentage. This event was duly reported in the Mumbai Samachar, Jam-e-Jamshed and Parsi Prakash‚Äô. Reformists Parsis, including the plaintiffs in the case of Petit vs. Jeejeebhoy cite the events of the Mazagon Navjotes as evidence of universal acceptance in Zoroastrianism.  Nirang Prayers Ervad Aibara mentioned that over the years, the spiritual power of Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb communicated with him regularly through his inner voice. Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb gave Ervad Aibara a number of nirangs (short prayers) and instructed him to give these nirangs to any person who came to him for help in difficulties. Many people benefited from these prayers in India as well as overseas, during the later half of the 20th century. The faith in Dasturji Kukadaru Saheb spread considerably due to the power of these prayers.

Her family moved to Morston in Norfolk, where her father served until the year before his death in Greenwich Hospital. Mainly educated at home, Cudlip took up writing about this time and contributed an article, \\"A Stroll in the Park\\", to the first issue of London Society. She published her first novel, The Cross of Honour, in 1863 at age 24, following it with the first three-volume novels Sir Victor's Choice and Barry O'Byrnethree months later. The publisher William Tinsley published Denis Donne and Theo Leigh while Chapman & Hall released a series of her three-volume novels, including On Guard, Played Out, Walter Goring, Called to Account, The Dower House, A Passion in Tatters, Blotted Out, A Narrow Escape and Mrs. Cardigan. Many of her earliest were highly controversial and dealt with subjects such as the sexuality of young girls and illegitimate pregnancy. Her work was often compared to that of Florence Marryat, a childhood friend and neighbour. She was closely associated throughout her career with William Tinsley, who remarked in 1865, after her first two novels had been published by John Maxwell, that she was \\"a light- hearted girl, and a writer of bright, easy-reading fiction, of which she could write almost acres in a short time. But when she found time to write so much was often a puzzle to me, for she seemed always to be out and about. She was in a bright and merry set at the time, many of whom had 'at homes', dinner parties, dances, and merry meetings of different kinds, including some theatre-going.\\" He claimed that she could easily disgorge one of her \\"triple- deckers\\" in six weeks. Having refused an offer of marriage from W. S. Gilbert in 1866, she married Rev. Pender Hodge Cudlip on 10 July 1867. they had six children. Rev. Cudlip was a High Church clergyman and amateur theological author. The two lived in Devon for much of their married lives. However, in 1873, she and her husband moved for eight years to Paddington, London, where she was involved in animal rights groups and wrote of animal cruelty in London during the period. Her favourite Stella setter contracted hydrophobia and eventually had to be destroyed. A large greyhound, Cavac, had been her constant companion for ten years and was one of the many dogs killed in the infamous London dog poisonings in 1876. She had included him as a character in her 1867 novel Called to Account. Two of her elder sons died in March of that year and another in February 1879. Of her three surviving children, one married Major William Price Drury, a Royal Marine, who wrote some nautical novels at the end of the 19th and earlier part of the 20th century. Cudlip was the editor of Ours: A Holiday Quarterly and a regular contributor to All the Year Round, Appleton's Journal, the Broadway, Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly and other magazines in Britain and the United States, between 1876 and 1884. She also wrote serial novels for The Ladies' Pictorial and a group of other provincial journals. She and her husband returned to Devon in 1884, where Pender Cudlip would serve as Vicar of Sparkwell for 25 years. She continued writing single-volume novels for such publishers as Chatto & Windus around the start of the 20th century. However, she began experiencing financial problems within a few years and applied to the Royal Literary Fund in 1907 and 1908. In the latter year she claimed that the highest offer she had received for her latest novel was ¬£15. Her husband died in 1911 and Annie Cudlip died seven years later on 24 November 1918.

He was Professor of Greek language at the Royal Frederick University from 1838. Vibe was born in Bergen as a son of County Governor, General War Commissioner and chamberlain Niels Andreas Vibe (1759‚Äì1814) and Margery Kierulff (1775‚Äì1852). He was a nephew of Johan Vibe and Ditlev Wibe, brother of Henriette Gislesen, brother-in-law of Heinrich Arnold Thaulow and second cousin of Ludvig C√¶sar Martin Aubert. The family moved to Christiania in 1811. Vibe took his examen artium in 1820, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.philol. degree in 1827. In 1829, he was hired as a Latin teacher at Christiania Cathedral School. Vibe was a lecturer in Greek at the University from 1830, and was promoted to professor in 1838. He is known for translating The Birds and Prometheus Bound, and also for a work on Spartan governance named Hvad var Spartas Ekklesi?. Vibe was, however, most interested in preserving the position of the classical languages in society. He was an advisor to politician Hans Riddervold in the late 1840s, and also chaired the public commission Skolekommisjonen av 1847. In 1848, Vibe started the conservative newspaper Christiania-Posten with Carl Arntzen, and also left the university to become principal of Christiania Cathedral School. Vibe was a conservatist, whereas commission member Hartvig Nissen was a reformer; the third commission member was Ludvig C√¶sar Martin Aubert. In general, Vibe was allied with Frederik Moltke Bugge, whereas other positions like Anton Martin Schweigaard and Herman Foss favored the natural sciences. Around 1850 natural sciences were introduced in secondary schools in Norway, except for Christiania, Trondhjem and Bergen Cathedral School. During Vibe's career as principal at Christiania Cathedral School, the number of students fell. He fell ill after 1870, and was substituted with Emil Schreiner. It became clear that he could not return, and he retired in 1872. Vibe was married to Ferdinanda Augusta Wilhelmine Steensgaard (1812‚Äì1898) from December 1833. He was a great- grandfather of Inger Alver Gl√∏ersen and Gunnar Fougner H√∏st. Vibe died in June 1881 in Kristiania.

The Sarawak-based seat fell vacant after the death of its incumbent member, Robert Lau Hoi Chew, from liver cancer on 9 April 2010. The seat was defended for the Barisan Nasional coalition government by Robert Lau Hui Yew of the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), while Sarawak State Assemblyman Wong Ho Leng contested the poll for the Democratic Action Party (DAP) in the Pakatan Rakyat opposition coalition. Wong won the election by 398 votes, wresting the seat from the Barisan Nasional. At the time of the election there were 54,695 registered voters, a majority of whom were ethnic Chinese. In the previous general election in 2008, the incumbent, Hoi Chew retained the seat with a 3,235-vote majority against Wong Ho Leng, and Lim Chin Chuang of the People's Justice Party. The Sibu seat had been last won by the DAP in 1982,Sibu By-Election To See \\"Battle Of The Mighty Rejang\\" Bernama but had since been won continuously by the SUPP.Sibu by-election to see \\"Battle of the Mighty Rejang\\" The Star In this election, known as the \\"Battle of the Mighty Rejang\\", the government and opposition went head-to-head on a number of local issues concerning Sarawak, including poverty, education and development. Background and history The Sibu constituency has been dominated by the contest between the SUPP and the DAP for approximately three decades. The DAP won the seat in the 1982 general election when Ling Sie Ming defeated Wong Soon Kai by 141 votes, causing Sibu to become the first DAP-held parliamentary seat in Sarawak. The DAP lost the seat in the 1986 election to the Barisan Nasional, and in the 1990 election won the seat through Robert Lau Hoi Chew. Lau held the seat until his death from liver cancer on 9 April 2010. His winning margin in the 2008 election had been 3,235 votes. Despite Lau's dominance of the federal seat from 1990, the SUPP were shocked in the 1996 state election when two of its State Assembly seats within Sibu town ‚Äî Pelawan and Bukit Assek ‚Äî fell to the DAP. The Bukit Assek loss saw the defeat of its president and the then Deputy Chief Minister of Sarawak, Wong Soon Kai. The defeat spelled the end of Wong's political career and the election of the DAP's Wong Ho Leng to the Sarawak State Assembly. Wong Ho Leng subsequently lost the Bukit Assek seat in the 2001 state election, but regained it in 2006. At the time of the by-election, 66.7% of the seat's 54,695 registered voters were ethnic Chinese; the rest of the population being Malays or indigenous Sarawakians. Christians make up 53 per cent of the electorate while the rest include Muslims, Buddhists and other religions. The seat was largely urban. Nomination of candidates The by-election was triggered by the death of Sibu's incumbent Member of Parliament, Robert Lau Hoi Chew on 9 April 2010. The Election Commission subsequently set down the by-election for 16 May 2010, with candidate nominations to occur on 8 May. Within a few days, the Sibu branch of SUPP recommended Robert Lau Hui Yew to contest the by-election for the governing Barisan Nasional coalition. Hui Yew was the second cousin of Hoi Chew and the son of Lau Swee Nguong, chairman of the KTS Group of companies. On 14 April, the opposition has decided that a DAP candidate should contest the by-election. Opposition Leader and People's Justice Party (PKR) adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim scheduled a visit to Sibu on 18 April. On the same day, Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat was formed as an opposition coalition composed of the DAP, PKR, and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) ‚Äî all members of the national Pakatan Rakyat coalition ‚Äî and the local Sarawak National Party. The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin visited Sibu on 19 April, expressing confidence that the voters were leaning towards supporting Barisan Nasional. While SUPP's candidate was confirmed only a few days after Hoi Chew's death, the DAP delayed announcing its candidate until 27 April. SUPP alleged the delay was due to a split in the DAP; however, the DAP insisted the delay was a calculated political strategy. On 27 April, the Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat announced Wong Ho Leng, state chairman of the DAP and State Assemblyman for Bukit Assek, as its candidate. Wong had earlier indicated his reluctance to stand in the by-election, suggesting that the party consider the opportunity to field a younger candidate. Robert Lau Hui Yew and Wong Ho Leng were joined by an independent candidate, Narawi Haron. A businessman and former member of the Army, Narawi had been a candidate for the seat in the 1995 election. Narawi's campaign was dismissed by the SUPP as inconsequential, while the DAP admitted that a potential split of votes between the DAP and Narawi could hurt its chances. Election campaign issues The banners of the two main candidates from the Barisan Nasional & Democratic Action Party The by-election was widely known as the \\"Battle of the Mighty Rejang\\"The battle of the mighty Rejang Malaysiakini and was seen as a litmus test for the popularity of the opposition Pakatan Rakyat and governing Barisan Nasional coalitions on a including land rights, poverty, native displacement and unemployment in Sarawak.Sibu ‚Äì a high-priority poll for Pakatan and BN Free Malaysia Today One of the main issues during the election was the ban of the use of the word 'Allah' in Christian publications. However, the Sarawak police has banned political parties from using the issue during campaigning in the by-election as it was deemed to be a sensitive issue. Sarawak's Officer in Charge of Criminal Investigations, Huzir Mohamed, threatened to prosecute offenders of the ban under the Sedition Act or the Internal Security Act (ISA). Barisan Nasional The Barisan Nasional did not initially release a policy manifesto for the by-election, but sought support on the basis of its claim to have caused Sibu's economic growth and development. Nevertheless, late in the campaign, the BN-SUPP candidate, Robert Lau Hui Yew, himself released a manifesto in which, according to Bernama, he mentioned that he would prioritise \\"getting more investment, job creation, skills training for single parents to increase their income, install more CCTVs in town to improve security and reduce street crimes rates as well as to transform Sibu into a 'wireless' township.\\" During the campaign period, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had distributed RM18 million to 60 Chinese aided primary schools, five independent Chinese secondary schools and two missionary schools in Sibu. Najib said that the Barisan Nasional government would continue to do more for Chinese education in the country, saying that \\"the Barisan government is a true friend of Chinese education,\\" when addressing more than 3,000 Chinese educationists. Besides that, some 246 families living in an under-developed region in Sungai Igan within the constituency had received a total of RM147,600 as a one-off allocation from the Federal Government. Four Methodist churches in town had been given special grants totalling RM1.75 million from the BN federal government in the final hours of the by-election campaign. The SUPP attacked the DAP on the basis of its coalition with the Islamist PAS, arguing that \\"A vote for Rocket is a vote for Islamic State\\". Lim Kit Siang, the parliamentary leader of the DAP, said that the issue was a \\"killer weapon\\" which could \\"finish off\\" the chances of DAP's candidate winning by frightening off the Chinese and non-Muslim voters in Sibu as it did during the 1999 Malaysian General Election where both Karpal Singh and Lim himself lost their parliamentary seats. The SUPP also claimed that if the DAP was to be voted in kampua noodles could no longer be sold as they were mixed with pork lard; a reference to PAS's policy to establish Malaysia as an Islamic state. Abdul Taib Mahmud, the BN chief minister of Sarawak, revised new land renewal rates which took effect on June 1. He said that the Sarawak new land rates is the cheapest in Malaysia as compared to other states. In accordance with opposition proposal for the unconditioned, automatic renewal of land leases, he also challenged the opposition-led state governments to announce new land rates lower than the current one announced by himself, without risking the income of the state governments. Najib Tun Razak, the Prime Minister and leader of BN, promised voters in Rejang Park, a DAP stronghold, 5 million ringgit to alleviate floods if SUPP‚Äôs Robert Lau Hui Yew won the seat, stating at an election appearance: \\"Do we have a deal or not? We do! You want the RM5 million, I want Robert Lau to win.‚Äù Democratic Action Party The DAP set out a seven-point manifesto with the theme \\"Sibu Jom Ubah\\" or \\"Sibu4change\\" for the by-election campaign and on the top of it is solving the town's flood woes in two years when the party and its coalition becomes the government at the federal and state levels. Another point in the manifesto stated that DAP would provide all Sarawakians aged above 60 a minimum of RM100 per annum as a gift for their contributions to the state. A minimum wage of RM750 per month for workers in the peninsula and RM830 for workers in Sarawak will be introduced and on education, DAP promised that all schools would be given allocations according to their needs as practised in Penang, Selangor and Kelantan. The three other points in the manifesto concerned oil royalty, land reform, and competency, accountability and transparency in governance. The DAP also focused on landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the director of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years. On the ban of using the \\"Allah\\" issue during campaigns, the DAP had gone against it and had gone ahead with the issue in its campaign. Wong Ho Leng, the DAP election candidate, said that the facts must be made known to the public. Wong also promised that if elected, he would call upon the Prime Minister and Home Minister to immediately cease the legal dispute with the Christian churches over these matters to protect the freedom of religion in Malaysia for non- Muslims. The DAP has also challenge candidate Robert Lau to make his stand about the ban on non-Muslims using the word \\"Allah\\" with DAP MP Teresa Kok stating that \\"If Robert Lau intends to be a Member of Parliament that speaks up for a Christian-majority constituency, Sibu, then he has the moral duty to declare his stand on this thorny issue, so that the voters in Sibu can decide whether they can count on him to speak up on this issue,\\" Another issue that was brought up during the by-election was the decision of the Home Ministry to destroy the 5,000 copies of Indonesian Bibles confiscated. On SUPP's questioning DAP's association with PAS despite having different ideology, the DAP defended itself by stating that PAS has been steadfast in the rights to freedom of religion of non-Muslims and this can be seen through PAS being able to declare that there is absolutely nothing in the Quran which forbids the use of the term \\"Allah\\" in Christian publications. The DAP sought to pressure Robert Lau Hui Yew over the government's proposed Goods and Services Tax, arguing that the tax would increase prices for consumers in one of Malaysia's poorest states. The DAP, through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew to speak up against the government's education policy, claiming that Hui Yew's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his lack of confidence in Malaysian education. On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement in the sale of the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the price of one ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building. Results The election was won by Wong Ho Leng by a margin of 398 votes over Robert Lau Hui Yew. The result was seen as a surprise win for the DAP and the opposition, as it ended a run of by-election defeats for the Pakatan Rakyat parties and boosted the DAP ahead of the state elections due to be held in Sarawak in 2011. The victorious Wong claimed his election was a \\"miracle\\". 37,919 out of 54,695 registered voters cast a ballot, signifying a 70% turnout. There were 395 spoilt votes. Postal votes controversy The announcement of the result was marred by a two-hour-long delay because of arguments over the discrepancies of the postal votes by Pakatan Rakyat election agents. Of the 2,827 ballot papers issued for postal votes, BN won 2,323 votes (82.2%), DAP won 70 (2.4%), the independent won 36 (1.2%) while 208 (7.3%) were considered spoilt. Pahang PKR secretariat director Zaidi Ahmad, who was appointed by the party as the team leader in charge of monitoring the postal votes during the polls, mentioned that the DAP would not have won if the 208 postal votes were not declared spoilt and the 170 ballot papers for what he claimed were \\"phantom postal voters\\" were returned and added to the tally. Zaidi had claimed that the forms state the names, identification numbers and information about the voters and are supposed to be signed by the voters themselves as well as their witnesses. However, the election agents noticed that the same witness would sign differently on different forms. On some forms, the voters themselves did not even sign them. Zaidi concluded by saying that it meant that others had signed on their behalf. He added that only after persistent complaints from the PR's election agents, Election Commission officials agreed to consider 208 ballot papers from the postal votes as spoilt votes. He also said that they have found at least between 700 and 800 more postal votes that had discrepancies but the EC disallowed these from being considered as spoilt. Zaidi finally claimed that if the by-election had truly been run properly, DAP could have won with a much bigger majority as if at least 700 more postal votes were rejected as spoilt, DAP could have won the polls with a majority of a little over 1,000. As a result, the Election Commission would review the postal voting system where EC chairman Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof said they would study the proposal to call for an early voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes. Nevertheless, the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to be abolished altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and is prone to abuse and exploitation by the government to their benefit. Aftermath With the win of the DAP's candidate, there were various responses from the community. While there is fear by the local Chinese community leaders that BN's defeat in Sibu would affect the town's growth, others like the opposition take it as a good omen as BN can no longer take Sarawak as its \\"fixed-deposit\\" in terms of parliamentary seats and neglect the state's development. Chua Soi Lek of the Malaysian Chinese Association, a member of the BN, said that the government could no longer hide from the fact that there were issues plaguing the Chinese community and that it can no longer be swept under the carpet following the losing of Chinese-majority polling centres in the by-election. Lim Kit Siang of the DAP mentioned that the party's win in Sibu renews Pakatan Rakyat's Putrajaya dream, referring to PR's ambition to form the Federal government in the next 13th general election. However, political scientists mentioned that PR would have a tough time getting support from rural areas, referring to the DAP's dismal performance in rural polling centres. Nevertheless, encouraged by the strong support from the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by-election, DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese-majority parliamentary seats (namely the Sarikei, Miri, Stampin and Lanang seats) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak. Abdul Taib Mahmud, the BN Chief Minister of Sarawak, said that the BN lost mainly due to the influx of PR campaigners from Peninsular Malaysia. Abang Johari Openg, Sarawak state Minister for Housing and Urban Development, blamed the \\"provocative tactics\\" allegedly employed by Pakatan Rakyat leaders for causing the defeat of the SUPP candidate, referring to the raising of the 'Allah' issue. President of Parti Rakyat Sarawak (a component party of BN in Sarawak) and state Minister of Land Development James Masing had warned Peninsular Malaysia-based opposition parties to refrain from practising \\"rowdy\\" politics in Sarawak saying that it might break down social order in the country, citing the May 13 incident where a racial riot occurred when BN lost its two-thirds supermajority in parliament during the 1969 Malaysian general election. As for the SUPP, its president George Chan Hong Nam who congratulated its winning candidate Wong immediately after the election result was announced, said that his party was completely overwhelmed by DAP's streetfighter style of politics and said, \\"these outsiders with their street culture have come to spoil the good nature of Sarawakians,\\" and that \\"SUPP would do all it could to ensure that the \\"outsiders\\" do not gain a foothold here\\". Wong Soon Koh, the SUPP state assemblyman for the Bawang Assan state seat within Sibu and a minister in the Sarawak state cabinet, claimed that the DAP was now extremely rich and could fly over campaigners from Peninsula Malaysia to Sibu for the by- election. Soon Koh's remarks came under fire by Chong Chieng Jen of the DAP where he defended the party by saying that nearly all DAP campaigners including Members of Parliament, state assemblymen or ordinary members, took care of their own expenses and stayed either with party members in Sibu or in low-budget hotels to save expenses. Chong also said that unlike BN leaders, they do not fly first class, nor stay at five-star hotels which are paid for by the federal or state government under the pretext of carrying out their government duties while on the other hand obviously campaigning for the SUPP candidate. Ibrahim Ali, the president of Malay rights group Perkasa labelled the Chinese in Sibu as ungrateful for not voting for the BN. He claimed that the Chinese in Sibu had not appreciated the development projects and financial allocations offered by BN while the Bumiputera had to endure and compromise with the wish of Chinese community. His statement however, was met with strong opposition from the local community, including the Bumiputera community, and he was dubbed as 'ignoramus' upon his statement. Nevertheless, the losing candidate, Lau Hui Yew, pledged that he will continue to serve the people as a councilor of Sibu Municipal Council (SMC) and as a party leader. On the other hand, Muhyiddin Yassin, the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and BN's campaign director in Sibu, said that the BN will keep all promises and commitments made during the by-election even though the party lost the by- election.

Above the village, the valley rises steeply towards Gorenja Brezovica, and to the northwest it drops to the small Ponikve Karst Field. During heavy rains, Ponikva Creek in the karst field floods; it surfaces here after running below ground from Rakitna and then disappears into the Rupe Sinkholes at the northwest end of the karst field. Tilled fields and meadows cover the floor of the dry karst valley, and the slopes of Lisec Hill to the northeast and ≈†tanga Hill () to the southwest are wooded. There is a low-quality hay field mowed once a year at Pungert on the lower slope of ≈†tanga Hill. Name The name Dolenja Brezovica literally means 'lower Brezovica', distinguishing the village from neighboring Gorenja Brezovica (literally, 'upper Brezovica'). The names Brezovica, Brezje, and names like them are relatively common in Slovenia and in other Slavic countries (e.g., B≈ôezovice in the Czech Republic, Brezovica in Serbia, etc.). The Slovene names Brezovica and Brezje are derived from the common noun breza 'birch'. Like similar toponyms in Slovenia (e.g., Brezova, Brezovec, Brezovci), it originally referred to the local vegetation.

The furs were mostly sold in China in exchange for tea, silks, porcelain, and other Chinese goods, which were then sold in Europe and the United States. The maritime fur trade was pioneered by Russians, working east from Kamchatka along the Aleutian Islands to the southern coast of Alaska. British and Americans entered during the 1780s, focusing on what is now the coast of British Columbia. The trade boomed around the beginning of the 19th century. A long period of decline began in the 1810s. As the sea otter population was depleted, the maritime fur trade diversified and transformed, tapping new markets and commodities, while continuing to focus on the Northwest Coast and China. It lasted until the middle to late 19th century. Russians controlled most of the coast of what is now Alaska during the entire era. The coast south of Alaska endured fierce competition between, and among, British and American trading vessels. The British were the first to operate in the southern sector, but were unable to compete against the Americans, who dominated from the 1790s to the 1830s. The British Hudson's Bay Company entered the coast trade in the 1820s with the intention of driving the Americans away. This was accomplished by about 1840. In its late period, the maritime fur trade was largely conducted by the British Hudson's Bay Company and the Russian-American Company. The term \\"maritime fur trade\\" was coined by historians to distinguish the coastal, ship-based fur trade from the continental, land-based fur trade of, for example, the North West Company and American Fur Company. Historically, the maritime fur trade was not known by that name, rather it was usually called the \\"North West Coast trade\\" or \\"North West Trade\\". The term \\"North West\\" was rarely spelled as the single word \\"Northwest\\", as is common today. The maritime fur trade brought the Pacific Northwest coast into a vast, new international trade network, centered on the north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on capitalism, but not, for the most part, on colonialism. A triangular trade network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the Hawaiian Islands (only recently discovered by the Western world), Britain, and the United States (especially New England). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the Aleut, Sugpiaq, Tlingit, Haida, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Chinook peoples. A rapid increase of wealth occurred among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, potlatching, slaving, and depopulation due to epidemic disease. However, the indigenous culture was not overwhelmed by rapid change, but actually flourished. For instance, the importance of totems and traditional nobility crests increased,For more on the use of crests on the North West Coast, see: and the Chinook Jargon, which remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture, was developed during this era. Native Hawaiian society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade's effect on China and Europe was minimal, but for New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to its transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially textile manufacturing. A sea otter, drawing by S. Smith after John Webber Modern and historical ranges of sea otter subspecies The most profitable furs were those of sea otters, especially the northern sea otter, Enhydra lutris kenyoni, which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River in the south to the Aleutian Islands in the north. Sea otters possess a thicker fur than any other mammal, and the sea otter's habit of grooming their coat prevents molting. The reason for their exploitation was due to this 'dark [thick] and silver tipped fur'.Vasilii N. Berkh.

Materials for the study of Alaskan History, No. 5. Kingston, Ontario: Limestone Press. p. 79. The popularity and demand in fashion of sea otter pelts in China was one of the reasons why it was hunted to the point of disappearance. These mammals of the Pacific are currently 'listed as Threatened under the Canadian Species at Risk Act'.Edward J. Gregr, Linda M. Nichol, Jane C. Watson, John K. B. Ford and Graeme M. Ellis.

Sea otter distribution extends from the north of Japan all the way to the vicinity of Cedros Island, Mexico. The species stayed approximately within the arc of the Northern Pacific until the pressure of the maritime trade forced them to move north. The start of their decline with the first Russian expeditions in this region. Aleut hunters were the providers of the skins to the Russians; the former became 'the main purveyor of prime otter skins to Russian traders and American adventurers'.Arthur Woodward. Sea Otter Hunting on the Pacific Coast. Publ. University of California Press on behalf of the Historical Society of Southern California. The Quarterly: Historical Society of Southern California, Vol. 20, No. 3 (SEPTEMBER,1938).P.120 Before the exploitation of these mammals, their population ranged from 150,000 to 300,000. Sea otters are 'slow breeders, only one sometimes two pups [are] being born at a time', which does not help the population when being pursued.Arthur Woodward. Sea Otter Hunting on the Pacific Coast. Publ. University of California Press on behalf of the Historical Society of Southern California. The Quarterly: Historical Society of Southern California, Vol. 20, No. 3 (SEPTEMBER,1938).P.129 The Chinese sought this mammal's fur due to its great commercial value and its 'prime coat' all year long. The pelt was used by the wealthy Chinese as clothing decoration (robe trimming) and the Russians used it as an ornamental piece. The other furs that were sent to Europe and America were changed to 'coat collars or hats'.Web- Alaska History and Cultural Studies Due to this great demand and worth of the sea otters pelt, the Russian-America Company (RAC) annual expenses was around 1000,000 rubles each year and profited over 500,000 rubles per year. The fur of the Californian southern sea otter, E. l. nereis, was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern sea otter was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern sea otter was likewise nearly extinct.Fur trade, Northwest Power & Conservation Council The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton system. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta. Origins The Maritime fur trade system within a global context, 1790 to 1840 The Pacific Northwest was one of the last significant nonpolar regions in the world to be explored by Europeans. Centuries of reconnaissance and conquest had brought the rest of North America within the claims of imperial powers. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a number of empires and commercial systems converged upon the Northwest Coast, by sea as well as by land across the continent. The Russian and Spanish empires were extended into the region simultaneously, from opposite directions. Russian fur companies expanded into North America along the Aleutian Islands, reaching the Fox Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the early 1760s. Kodiak Island was discovered in 1763 by Stepan Glotov. In 1768, an expedition was carried out by the Russian Navy, under Pyotr Krenitsyn and Mikhail Levashev. Two ships sailed from Kamchatka to the Alaska Peninsula for the purpose of assessing the existing Russian activity and the possibilities of future development.Haycox, pp. 58‚Äì62 Reports about the voyage, meant to be kept secret, spread through Europe and caused alarm in Spain. The Spanish government, already concerned about Russian activity in Alaska, decided to colonize Alta California and sent exploratory voyages to Alaska to assess the threat and strengthen Spanish claims of sovereignty on coast north of Mexico. The province of Alta California was established by Jos√© de G√°lvez in 1769, just as the Krenitsyn-Levashev expedition was concluding. Five separate expeditions were dispatched to Alta California in 1769. By 1782, presidios had been established at San Diego, Monterey, San Francisco and Santa Barbara, linked by a series of mission stations along the coast. Spanish exploration voyages to the far north were launched in 1774, 1775, and 1779. In 1784, the center of Russian activity shifted east to Kodiak Island and hunting operations were extended into Cook Inlet. The two empires seemed destined to clash, but before direct Russian-Spanish contact was made new powers appeared on the Northwest Coast‚ÄîBritain and the United States. When the clash came, at Nootka Sound in 1789, it was not between Spain and Russia but between Spain and Britain. The British first reached the region by sea in 1778, during James Cook's third voyage, and by land in 1793, when Alexander Mackenzie's transcontinental explorations reached the Pacific. The first British maritime fur trader, James Hanna, arrived on the Northwest Coast in 1785. The first American traders, John Kendrick and Robert Gray, arrived by sea in 1788.Laut, pp. 55‚Äì58 The Lewis and Clark Expedition arrived overland in 1805.Lewis and Clark Timeline 1805, LewisAndClarkTrail.com The early maritime fur traders were explorers, as well as traders. The Northwest Coast is very complex ‚Äî a \\"labyrinth of waters\\", according to George Simpson‚Äî with thousands of islands, numerous straits and fjords, and a mountainous, rocky, and often very steep shoreline. Navigational hazards included persistent rain, high winds, thick fogs, strong currents, and tides, and hidden rocks. Wind patterns were often contrary, variable, and baffling, especially within the coastal straits and archipelagoes, which makes sailing dangerous. Early explorations before the maritime fur trade era‚Äîby Juan P√©rez, Bruno de Heceta, Bogeda y Quadra, and James Cook‚Äîproduced only rough surveys of the coast's general features. Detailed surveys were undertaken in only a few relatively small areas, such as Nootka Sound, Bucareli Bay, and Cook Inlet.Hayes (1999), pp. 35‚Äì45 Russian exploration before 1785 had produced mainly rough surveys, largely restricted to the Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska west of Cape Saint Elias.Hayes (1999), pp. 29‚Äì32, 52‚Äì53, 63, 66 British and American maritime fur traders began visiting the Northwest Coast in 1785, at which time it was mostly unexplored. Although noncommercial exploration voyages continued, especially by the Spanish Navy,Hayes (1999), pp. 67‚Äì81 the maritime fur traders made a number of significant discoveries. Notable examples include the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Clayoquot Sound, and Barkley Sound, all found by Charles William Barkley, Queen Charlotte Strait by James Strange, Fitz Hugh Sound by James Hanna, Grays Harbor and the Columbia River by Robert Gray. George Dixon explored the Dixon Entrance and was the first to realize that the Queen Charlotte Islands were not part of the mainland.Hayes (1999), pp. 55‚Äì58, 62, 82 Russia Russian maritime fur trading in the northern Pacific began after the exploration voyages of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov in 1741 and 1742. Their voyages demonstrated that Asia and North America were not connected but that sea voyages were feasible, and that the region was rich in furs. Private fur traders, mostly promyshlenniki, launched fur trading expeditions from Kamchatka, at first focusing on nearby islands such as the Commander Islands. Unlike fur trading ventures in Siberia, these maritime expeditions required more capital than most promyshlenniki could obtain. Merchants from cities such as Irkutsk, Tobolsk, and others in European Russia, became the principal investors. An early trader, Emilian Basov, traded at Bering Island in 1743, collecting a large number of sea otter, fur seal, and blue Arctic fox furs. Basov made four trips to Bering Island and nearby Medny Island and made a fortune, inspiring many other traders. From 1743 to the founding of the Russian-American Company in 1799, over 100 private fur-trading and hunting voyages sailed from Kamchatka to North America. In total, these voyages garnered over eight million silver rubles. During the early part of this era, the ships would typically stop at the Commander Islands to slaughter and preserve the meat of Steller's sea cows, a defenseless sea mammal whose range was limited to those islands. They were hunted not only for food, but also for their skins, used to make boats, and their subcutaneous fat, used for oil lamps. By 1768, Steller's sea cow was extinct. As furs were depleted on nearby islands, Russian traders sailed farther east along the Aleutian chain. By the 1760s, they were regularly sailing to Kodiak Island. Notable Russian traders in the early years of the trade include Nikifor Trapeznikov (who financed and participated in 10 voyages between 1743 and 1768), Maksimovich Solov'ev, Stepan Glotov, and Grigory Shelikhov.Oleksa, pp. 84‚Äì89 The settlement of Grigory Shelikhov on Kodiak Island As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became longer and more expensivea Smaller enterprises were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out as one of the most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress Catherine II decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of 28 September 1788. By the time of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were entering the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats of the most valuable sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second-grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal. The Russian system differed from the British and American systems in its relationship with indigenous peoples. Using the same method they had used in Siberia, the Russians employed or enserfed Aleut and Alutiiq people, the latter being a subgroup of the Yupik Eskimo people.Gibson (1976), pp. 32‚Äì33 The Aleut and Alutiiq people were expert sea otter hunters, noted for their use of kayaks and baidarkas. Russian ships were mainly used for transporting and assisting native hunting parties. This differed from the British and American system, where the natives hunted sea otters and prepared the furs on their own, and were essentially independent agents of the fur trade. The Russians did not trade freely with the native Alaskans; rather, they imposed a fur tribute known as yasak.Gibson (1992), pp. 14‚Äì15 The yasak system, which was widely used in Siberia, essentially enslaved the natives. In 1788, it was banned in Russian America, only to be replaced by compulsory labor. Britain Captain James Cook The British entry into the maritime fur trade dates to 1778 and the third voyage of Captain James Cook. While sailing north to search for the fabled Northwest Passage, Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands. On the Northwest Coast, he spent a month in Nootka Sound, during which he and his crew traded with the Nuu-chah-nulth from the village of Yuquot. They ended up with over 300 furs, mostly sea otter, but thought them of no great value.Pethick (1976), pp. 59, 63‚Äì64, 70‚Äì71 Later, after Cook had been killed in Hawaii, the expedition visited Canton and were surprised by how much money the Chinese were willing to pay for the furs. A profit of 1,800% was made.Gibson (1992), pp. 22‚Äì23 James King, one of the commanders after Cook's death, wrote, \\"the advantages that might be derived from a voyage to that part of the American coast, undertaken with commercial views, appear to me of a degree of importance sufficient to call for the attention of the public.\\" The crews of the two ships were so eager to return to Nootka Sound and acquire more furs, they were \\"not far short of mutiny\\". Nevertheless, they sailed for England, arriving there in October 1780.Pethick (1976), pp. 72‚Äì76 Accounts of Cook's voyage and the sea otter trade were published in the 1780s, triggering a rush of entrepreneurial voyages to the Northwest Coast. British interest in the maritime fur trade peaked between 1785 and 1794, then declined as the French Revolutionary Wars diminished Britain's available manpower and investment capital. The country also concentrated its foreign trade activities in India. British maritime fur traders were hindered by the East India Company (EIC) and South Sea Company (SSC). Although the SSC was moribund by the late 18th century, it had been granted the exclusive right to British trade on the entire western coast of the Americas from Cape Horn to Bering Strait and for 300 leagues (around ) out into the Pacific Ocean. This, coupled with the EIC monopoly on British trade in China, meant sea otter skins were procurable only in the preserve of one monopoly and disposable only in that of the other. To operate legally, British maritime fur traders had to obtain licenses from both companies, which was difficult and expensive. Some traders obtained a license from the EIC only, figuring the SSC was unable to enforce its monopoly. Others obtained only the SSC license and took their furs to England, where they were trans-shipped to China. Some traders tried to evade the licenses by sailing their ships under foreign flags.Gibson (1992), pp. 25‚Äì28 The EIC's primary focus in China was the tea trade, with never much interest within the company for the maritime fur trade. The EIC usually allowed British vessels to import furs into Canton, but required the furs to be sold via EIC agents, and the company took a percentage of the returns. Worse, the EIC did not allow the British fur traders to export Chinese goods to Great Britain. Thus, the last and most profitable leg of the maritime fur trade system‚Äîcarrying Chinese goods to Europe and America‚Äîwas denied to British traders. The first trading vessel dispatched solely for the purpose of the fur trade was the British Sea Otter commanded by James Hanna in 1785.Robert J. King, \\"Heinrich Zimmermann and the Proposed Voyage of the KKS Cobenzell to the North West Coast in 1782‚Äì1783\\", The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord, vol.21, no.3, July 2011, pp.235‚Äì262. In his brief visit to the coast, he obtained 560 pelts, which fetched a profit of $20,000 in Canton. The promise of such profits encouraged other traders.Native People, Native Lands: Canadian Indians, Inuit and M√©tis, by Bruce Alden Cox.

King, \\"William Bolts: An Eighteenth Century Merchant Adventurer\\", Archives: the Journal of the British Records Association, vol.xxxi, no.112, April 2005, pp.8‚Äì28. He was accompanied by his wife, Frances Barkley, who became the first European woman to visit the Hawaiian IslandsCapt. Barkley in IMPERIAL EAGLE in Barkley Sound, The Maritime Paintings of Gordon Miller and the first woman to sail around the world without deception. Only two women are known to have sailed around the world before Frances: Jeanne Bar√©, disguised as a man, and Rose de Freycinet, wife of Louis de Freycinet, as a stowaway.BARKLEY, Frances, ABCBookWorld Barkley chose to sail under the flag of Austria to evade paying for EIC and SSC licences. During their stop in Hawaii, the Barkleys hired a native Hawaiian named Win√©e as a maidservant. Win√©e was the first native Hawaiian to visit the Pacific Northwest‚Äîthe first of many Kanakas. Barkley explored the coast south of Nootka Sound, discovering the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the process. He was the first trader to visit Neah Bay, a Makah settlement that later became an important port of call for maritime fur traders. The launch of the North-West America at Nootka Sound, 1788 John Meares, who had also served under Cook, sailed to the North West Coast in 1786.Robert J. King, \\"John Meares: Dubliner, Naval Officer, Fur Trader and would-be Colonizer\\", Journal of Australian Naval History, vol.8, no.1, March 2011, pp.32‚Äì62. He spent the winter in Prince William Sound, his ship trapped by ice and his men dying of scurvy. He was rescued by the timely arrival of Dixon and Portlock. Meares organized a second expedition of two ships, the Felice Adventurero and Iphigenia Nubiana. Meares was captain of the Felice and William Douglas was captain of the Iphigenia. Meares decided not to license his ships with the EIC, instead trying to conceal the illegal activity by using the flag of Portugal. They arrived at Nootka Sound in May 1788. Meares later claimed that Chief Maquinna sold him some land and on it Meares had a building erected. These claims later became a point of dispute during the Nootka Crisis. Spain, which sought control of Nootka Sound, rejected both claims; the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. There is no doubt, however, that Meares had the sloop North West America built in Nootka Sound, the first nonindigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest. Meares and others organized another expedition the following year. A number of vessels sailed to Nootka Sound, including Argonaut under James Colnett, , under Thomas Hudson, and Iphigenia Nubiana and North West America. Colnett intended to establish a permanent fur-trading post at Nootka Sound. However, Spain had also decided to permanently occupy Nootka Sound and assert sovereignty on the North West Coast. The decision was mostly due to Russian activity in Alaska and Russia's threat to occupy Nootka Sound themselves. Spanish naval officer Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez arrived at Nootka in May 1789 and built Fort San Miguel. When the Argonaut arrived, a dispute arose between Colnett and Mart√≠nez, leading to the seizure of several British ships and the arrest of their crews. This incident led to the Nootka Crisis, an international crisis between Britain and Spain. War was averted with the first Nootka Convention of 1790.Nootka Crisis , Beyond the Map, Maritime Museum of BC United States American traders were largely influenced by an unauthorized report published by John Ledyard in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1783.Captain Cook's American , AmericanHeritage.com By the 1790s, American traders were outcompeting the British and soon came to dominate the maritime fur trade south of Russian America. The opening of the trade came at a good time for New England's merchants. It provided a way to escape the depression that had followed the American Revolutionary War. It presented new trading opportunities that more than made up for the closure of British home and colonial ports to US imports.Gibson (1992), pp. 36‚Äì37 First Nations along the coast referred to American traders in the Chinook jargon as Boston or Boston-men ‚Äì after their main port in New England.Thompson, Laurence C. & M. Dale Kinkade \\"Languages\\" in Handbook of the North American Indian: Volume 7 Northwest Coast. p.51 One of the first and most notable American maritime fur traders was Robert Gray.The Columbia Rediviva and Lady Washington might have been the first American vessels to trade on the Northwest Coast; possibly the Eleanora under Simon Metcalfe was the first; according to Gray made two trading voyages, the first from 1787 to 1790 and the second from 1790 to 1793. The first voyage was conducted with John Kendrick and the vessels Columbia Rediviva and Lady Washington. After the 1789 fur trading season was over, Gray sailed the Columbia to China via Hawaii, then to Boston via the Cape of Good Hope. The arrival of the Columbia at Boston was celebrated for being the first American circumnavigation of the world. However, the venture was not a commercial success. The ship's owners financed a second attempt and Gray sailed the Columbia from Boston only six weeks after arriving. Gray's second voyage was notable in several ways. After spending the summer trading on the Northwest Coast, Gray wintered on the coast. In Clayoquot Sound, Gray's crew built a house, dubbed Fort Defiance, and had the sloop built, the first American vessel built on the Northwest Coast. It was launched in March 1792 under the command of Robert Haswell. During the 1792 trading season, Gray concentrated on the southern part of the North West Coast, including the Columbia River. Although the mouth of the river had been spotted by the Spanish explorer Bruno de Heceta in 1775, no other explorer or fur trader had been able to find it and enter the river. Gray was the first to do so. He named the river after his ship. The event was later used by the United States in support of their claims to the Pacific Northwest. Other notable American maritime fur traders include William F. Sturgis,Gibson (1992), pp. 291-296 Joseph Ingraham,Hayes (1999), p. 83 Simon Metcalfe and his son Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, Daniel Cross,Rob Roy Author Exposed, Historic Nantucket article of the Nantucket Historical Association, John Boit, and James Magee, among many others. One of the most successful American firms involved in the Northwest Trade was Perkins and Company.Gibson (1992), pp. 249‚Äì250 Boom years=American ascendancy The maritime fur trade was dominated by American traders from the 1790s to the 1820s. Between 1788 and 1826, American merchant ships made at least 127 voyages between the United States and China, via the Northwest Coast. The returns were lucrative. During the late 1810s, the return on investment ranged from about 300% to 500%. Even higher profits were common in the first decade of the 19th century. Returns of 2,200% or higher were common, although when taking into account the cost of buying and outfitting vessels, the 2,200% return would be closer to 525%.Gibson (1992), pp. 56‚Äì57 The trade's boom years ended around 1810, after which a long decline was marked by increasing economic diversification. By 1810, the supply of sea otter pelts had fallen due to overhunting. American trade declined during the War of 1812, but after 1815, Americans were able to resume and expand the maritime fur trade, and continued to dominate. Russian expansion Sitka The Russian entry to the Northwest Coast, beyond Prince William Sound, was slow because of a shortage of ships and sailors. Yakutat Bay was reached in 1794 and the settlement of Slavorossiya, originally intended to be the colonial capital, was built there in 1795. Reconnaissance of the coast as far as the Queen Charlotte Islands was carried out by James Shields, a British employee of the Golikov-Shelikhov Company. In 1795, Alexandr Baranov sailed into Sitka Sound, claiming it for Russia. Hunting parties arrived in the following years. By 1800, three-quarters of the Russian-American Company's sea otter skins came from the Sitka Sound area, amounting to several thousand per year. Sitka Sound was also where serious competition between the Russians, British, and Americans first arose.Gibson (1992), pp. 13‚Äì14 In July 1799, Baranov returned to Sitka Sound on the brig Oryol and established the settlement of Arkhangelsk, also known as Fort Archangel Gabriel. In June 1802, Tlingit warriors attacked the settlement and killed or captured most of the 150 Russians and Aleuts living there. Baranov led an armed expedition to retake Sitka by force in June 1804. The Russian warship Neva joined Baranov at Sitka. A new Russian fort was established while the Tlingit prepared to defend themselves with a well-armed fort of their own. Tension rapidly escalated into skirmishes and negotiations broke down. In early October, the Russians attacked the Tlingit fort with cannon from the Neva and from a land party. The Tlingit responded with powerful gun and cannon fire of their own. The Battle of Sitka continued for several days until the Tlingit abandoned their fort and left the area. Tlingit accounts of the battle refuse to admit defeat or give the Russians credit for taking the Tlingit fort. The Russians destroyed the abandoned Tlingit fort and named the new Russian fort Novo-Arkhangelsk (New Archangel), also known as Fort Archangel Michael and Fort Saint Michael. The confrontations at Sitka in 1802 and 1804 played a significant role in subsequent Tlingit-Russian relations for generations. Novo-Arkhangelsk soon became the primary settlement and colonial capital of Russian America. After the Alaska Purchase, it was renamed Sitka, and became the first capital of Alaska Territory. The Russian-American Company (RAC) was incorporated in 1799, putting an end to the promyshlenniki period and beginning an era of centralized monopoly.Oleksa, p. 93 Its charter was laid out in a 1799 ukase by the new Tsar Paul, which granted the company monopolistic control over trade in the Aleutian Islands and the North America mainland, south to 55¬∞ north latitude (approximating the present border on coast between British Columbia and Alaska). The RAC was modeled on Britain's East India Company (EIC) and Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Russian officials intended the company to operate both as a business enterprise and a state organization for extending imperial influence, similar to the EIC and HBC. It was also hoped that the company would be able to conduct maritime trade with China and Japan, although this goal was not realized.Circumnavigation, Empire, Modernity, Race: The Impact of Round-the-World Voyages on Russia's Imperial Consciousness, Ilya Vinkovetsky; Library of Congress In 1818 the Russian government took control of the RAC from the merchants who held the charter. The explorer and naval officer Ferdinand Petrovich von Wrangel was the first president of the company during the government period. In 1867, the Alaska Purchase transferred control of Alaska to the United States and the commercial interests of the Russian American Company were sold to Hutchinson, Kohl & Company of San Francisco, who then merged with several other groups to form the Alaska Commercial Company. The Russian population in America never surpassed 1,000‚Äîthe peak was 823 in 1839. However, the RAC employed and fed thousands of natives. According to official census counts by the Russians, the population of Russian America peaked at 10,313 in 1838. An additional 12,500 people were known local residents not included in the colonial register. An estimated 17,000 more local residents were present but unknown to the Russians. Thus, the total population of Russian America was approximately 40,000.Some Results of the Study of the Maritime Colonization of Russian America and the Continental Colonization of Siberia, Nikolai N. Bolkhovitinov; Library of Congress Diversification and transformation=Russian-American Company Reconstructed chapel at Fort Ross Colony Ross, known as Fort Ross today, was built in California just north of San Francisco Bay. It was the RAC's southernmost outpost and operated from 1812 to 1841, and was established as an agricultural base for supplying the northern settlements with food as well as for conducting trade with Alta California. The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6 km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the California coast. By 1840, California's sea otter population had been severely depleted. The Russian Emperor Alexander I issued the Ukase of 1821 which announced Russian hegemony over the Northwest Coast from 45¬∞50‚Ä≤ north latitude onwards in a northern direction. The only Russian attempt to enforce the ukase of 1821 was the seizure of the US brig Pearl by the Russian sloop Apollon, in 1822. The Pearl, a maritime fur trading vessel, was sailing from Boston to Sitka. On a protest from the US government, the vessel was released and compensation paid.Macmillan's Magazine, Volume 77, 1898, p. 68 Britain and the United States protested and negotiations ultimately resulted in the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. These treaties established 54¬∞40‚Ä≤ as the southern boundary of exclusively Russian territory. The Anglo-Russian treaty delineated the boundary of Russian America fully. The border began on the coast at 54¬∞40‚Ä≤, then ran north along the mountains near the coast until it reached 141¬∞ west longitude, after which the boundary ran north along that line of longitude to the Arctic Ocean. Aside from boundary adjustments to the Alaska Panhandle, stemming from the Alaska boundary dispute of the late 19th century, this is the current boundary of the state of Alaska. In 1839 the RAC-HBC Agreement was signed, giving the Hudson's Bay Company a lease of the southeastern sector of what is now the Alaska Panhandle, as far north as 56¬∞ 30' north latitude. American methods and strategies American traders developed the \\"Golden Round\\" trade route around the world. Ships sailed from Boston to the Pacific via Cape Horn, then to the North West Coast, arriving in the spring or early summer. They would spend the summer and early autumn fur trading on the coast, mainly between Sitka and the Columbia River. In late autumn they sailed to the Hawaiian Islands, where they typically spent the winter, then from Hawaii to Macau on the Pearl River Delta, arriving in autumn. Trading in Canton did not begin until November, when tea shipments were ready. The Americans had to hire pilots to take their ships up the Pearl River to Canton's \\"outport\\" of Whampoa. Foreign ships were not allowed in Canton itself. Trading took weeks or months, after which the ships were loaded with Chinese goods such as teas, silks, porcelains, sugar, cassia, and curios. They left in the winter and used the northeasterly monsoon winds of the South China Sea to reach the Sunda Strait, then used the southeasterly trade winds to cross the Indian Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope. From there the ships sailed to Boston, where they traditionally docked at the India Wharf.Gibson (1992), pp. viii, 39‚Äì56 Frederic William Howay described this as the \\"golden round\\", writing: The Americans had a perfect golden round of profits: first, the profit on the original cargo of trading goods when exchanged for furs; second, the profit when the furs were transmuted into Chinese goods; and, third, the profit on those goods when they reached America.Gibson (1992), pp. 52‚Äì53; quoting In the later years of the North West Trade the pattern became more complex as additional markets and side voyages were incorporated. A sea otter As the North West trade developed it became riskier to depend solely upon acquiring sea otter furs through trade with the indigenous people of the coast. Diversification began in the first decade of the 19th century if not earlier, and increased over time. Maritime fur trading voyages were no longer solely about taking sea otter furs from the North West Coast to Canton. Other commodities and markets throughout the Pacific were added to the system. Sandalwood, mainly from Hawaii, became an important item of the China trade. Just as the sea otter trade was waning the sandalwood trade boomed, peaking in 1821, then declined. Hawaiian sandalwood was depleted by 1830.Gibson (1992), pp. 251‚Äì267 Fiji and the Marquesas Islands were the other principal sources of sandalwood. Most had been cut by 1820.Sandalwood Sustainability & Australian Regeneration Efforts , Aura Cacia Fiji was also a source of b√™che-de-mer, a gourmet delicacy in China. American traders began acquiring Fijian b√™che-de-mer in 1804 and trepanging boomed there. B√™che-de-mer became Fiji's leading export by 1830. Depletion led to a decline and the end of the trade by 1850. Trepanging was also done from 1812 in Hawaii and from 1814 in the Marquesas. Other side trades included Chilean copper from Valpara√≠so, scrimshaw (whale teeth), tortoise shells and meat from the Gal√°pagos Islands, sugar from Manila, and, from Java, areca nuts (so- called betel nuts) and coffee beans. Sealing boomed in the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands and the Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal was rapidly exploited to near- extinction. The northern fur seal rookeries were controlled by Russia, so Americans acquired northern fur seal skins through trade rather than sealing. Another side trade was smuggling along the Pacific coast of the Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade‚Äîthe provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From the first decade of the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar Nicholas I issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling. On the Northwest Coast itself the fur trade was supplemented with slave trading. The pre-existing indigenous slave trade was enlarged and expanded upon by fur traders, especially the American traders. While working the coast for furs, traders would purchase slaves around the mouth of the Columbia River and in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, then sell or trade them on the northern coast. Few traders admitted to slaving, although some wrote about it in detail. Further information comes from sources such as reports by HBC officers. Aemelius Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company wrote in 1828 that American traders on coast trafficked in slaves, \\"purchasing them at a cheap rate from one tribe and disposing of them to others at a very high profit.\\" He concluded that the American traders made more money from selling slaves, rum, and gunpowder than they did from fur trading.Gibson (1992), pp. 233‚Äì235 Decline Large-scale economic issues played a role in the decline of the maritime fur trade and the China trade in general. Before the 19th century, Chinese demand for Western raw materials or manufactured goods was small, but bullion (also known as specie) was accepted, resulting in a general drain of precious metals from the West to China. The situation reversed in the early 19th century for a variety of reasons. Western demand for Chinese goods declined relative to new options (for example, coffee from the West Indies began to replace tea in the United States), while Chinese demand for Western items increased, such as for English manufactures, American cotton goods, and opium which was outlawed but smuggled into China on a large and increasing scale. Before long, China was being drained of specie and saturated with Western goods. At the same time, intense speculation in the China trade by American and British merchant companies began. By the 1820s, too many firms were competing for an overstocked market, resulting in bankruptcies and consolidation. The inevitable commercial crisis struck in 1826‚Äì27, after the Panic of 1825. Tea prices plummeted and the China trade's volume collapsed by about a third. By this time, the old maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast and the Old China Trade itself were dying. The final blow came with the depression of 1841‚Äì43, following the Panic of 1837. Over time, the maritime fur traders concentrated on different parts of the North West Coast. In the 1790s, the west coast of Vancouver Island, especially Nootka Sound, was frequently visited. By the 1810s, the locus had shifted to the Queen Charlotte Islands and Alexander Archipelago, and in the 1820s, farther north to areas near Sitka Sound. After about 1830, it shifted south to the area from Dixon Entrance to Queen Charlotte Sound. During the early years, ships tended to cruise the coast, seeking trading opportunities whenever they arose. Later, ships spent more time in specific harbors. As fur resources dwindled and prices rose, ship captains increasingly concentrated on a few key ports of call and stayed longer. Eventually, acquiring enough furs for the China trade in a single year was no longer possible. Some traders wintered in Hawaii, returning to the coast in the spring, but many wintered on the North West Coast, usually in one of the key trading harbors. These harbors included \\"Clemencitty\\" on Tongass Island, today called Port Tongass; the several \\"Kaigani\\" harbors on south Dall Island north of Cape Muzon, including American Bay and Datzkoo Harbor (known as Taddiskey or Tattasco);Gibson (1992), p. 127For more information, see , , , and \\"Nahwitti\\" or \\"Newhitty\\" on northern Vancouver Island; and \\"Tongass\\" in Clarence Strait, today called Tamgas Harbor, which was said to be the most popular wintering place for American ships in the 1830s. Many significant trading sites were on the Queen Charlotte Islands, including Cloak Bay, Masset, Skidegate, Cumshewa, and Skedans, and Houston Stewart Channel, known as \\"Coyah's Harbor\\", after Chief Koyah.Trading site information throughout Gibson (1992) As marine furs became depleted in the early 19th century, American ship captains began to accept increasing numbers of land furs such as beaver, which were brought from the interior to the coast via indigenous trade networks from New Caledonia‚Äîtoday the Omineca and Nechako districts of the Central Interior of British Columbia. During the 1820s, the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), which considered the interior fur trade to be its domain, began to experience significant losses as a result of this diversion of furs to the coast. To protect its interests, the HBC entered the coast trade to drive away the American traders. This goal was achieved during the 1830s. By 1841, the American traders had abandoned the North West Coast. For a time, the North West Coast trade was controlled by the HBC and the RAC.Gibson (1992), pp. 60‚Äì61, 180‚Äì181 Following the 1846 resolution of the Oregon Territory controversy between the United States and England, and the American purchase of Alaska in 1867, American hunters returned to hunting sea otters in the region, both from land and sea. Hunting throughout the Aleutian and Kuril Islands by American commercial outfits also contributed to the near-extinction of the species by the late 1800s. Hudson's Bay Company From 1779 to 1821 two British fur trading companies, the Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) and the London-based Hudson's Bay Company, competed for control of the fur trade of what later became Western Canada.The Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Vancouver: Cultural Landscape Report, Instrodution, Volume 2. National Park Service The struggle, which eventually reached the point of armed battles such as the 1816 Battle of Seven Oaks, was mostly over control of Rupert's Land, east of the Continental Divide. Around the turn of the 19th century the NWC expanded its operations westward, across the Rocky Mountains into the mostly unexplored Pacific Northwest. By the 1810s the NWC had established new fur trading operations west of the Rockies, in New Caledonia and the Columbia District. Starting in 1811 the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) challenged the NWC in the Pacific Northwest, but during the War of 1812 the PFC, at risk of being captured by the British Navy, sold its entire operation to the NWC. The PFC had built Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River. Under the NWC it was renamed Fort George, and became the Columbia District's Pacific seaport. The NWC sought to establish a profitable beaver fur trade with China. Due to the East India Company's (EIC) control over British trading in Canton the NWC turned to American shipping companies. Starting in 1792 the NWC had beaver furs shipped to China by American firms. After the acquisition of Fort George (Astoria) in 1815 the NWC began to supply the Columbia District by sea through the Boston- based firm of Perkins and Company. After arriving at Fort George the American ship took a cargo of NWC beaver furs to Canton, exchanged them for China goods and conveyed them to Boston for sale. Even though Perkins and Company took 25% of the proceeds the arrangement was still about 50% more profitable than using British ships and selling furs in Canton through the EIC for bills payable on London and returning from China with no cargo. In 1821, after tensions between the NWC and HBC had erupted into violence the NWC was forced to merge into the HBC. As a result, the HBC acquired the Columbia District and its trade with China. At first the system of shipping furs via the American Perkins and Company was continued, but in 1822 the United States Customs Service imposed a heavy ad valorem duty on the proceeds. The HBC stopped using American middlemen and instead tried selling furs through the EIC. In 1824 and 1825 the HBC sold 20,000 beaver and 7,000 land-otter skins in China through the EIC, but the arrangement did not prove advantageous for either firm.Gibson (1992), pp. 26‚Äì28 In the wake of the NWC's forced merger into the HBC, George Simpson reorganized operations in New Caledonia and the Columbia Department. His efforts and keen fiscal sense, combined with a resurgence of American traders on the coast after the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, resulted in the HBC's decision to enter the coast maritime fur trade and drive out the Americans. By the early 1820s American traders were taking 3,000 to 5,000 beaver skins, mostly from New Caledonia, to Canton every year. By the early 1830s the number had reached 10,000 annually, which was as many as the HBC itself was acquiring from New Caledonia and half of the total output of the entire Columbia Department. In addition, the Americans were paying higher prices for the furs, which forced the HBC to do the same.Gibson (1992), pp. 62‚Äì63 The HBC effort to gain control of the coastal fur trade began in the late 1820s. It took some time for the HBC to acquire the necessary ships, skilled seamen, trade goods, and intelligence about the coast trade. Simpson decided that the \\"London ships\\", which brought goods to Fort Vancouver and returned to England with furs, should arrive early enough to make a coasting voyage before departing. The first London ship to do this was the schooner Cadboro, in 1827. However, its voyage did not get beyond the Strait of Georgia and only 2 sea otter and 28 land otter and beaver skins were acquired. In 1828 the HBC decided to deploy three ships for the coast trade, but setbacks caused delays. The William and Ann was lost in 1829, and the Isabella in 1830, both at the Columbia Bar. The HBC's shipping was inadequate for the coast trade until the middle 1830s.Gibson (1992), pp. 67‚Äì68 In 1835 two ships were added to the HBC's coast fleet. One of them, the Beaver, was a steamship, and it proved extremely useful in the variable winds, strong currents, and long narrow inlets.Gibson (1992), pp. 64‚Äì83 The HBC steamship Beaver To strengthen its coast trade the Hudson's Bay Company built a series of fortified trading posts, the first of which was Fort Langley, established in 1827Fort Langley National Historic Site ‚Äì History, Parks Canada on the Fraser River about from the river's mouth.History of Fort Langley , Fort Langley, BC The next was Fort Simpson, founded in 1831 at the mouth of the Nass River, and moved in 1834 several miles to the present Port Simpson. In 1833 Fort McLoughlin was established on an island in Milbanke Sound and Fort Nisqually was built at the southern end of Puget Sound. An overland trail linked Fort Nisqually and Fort Vancouver, so HBC vessels trading along the northern coast could unload furs and take on trade goods without having to navigate the Columbia River and its hazardous bar. Later coastal posts included Fort Stikine (1840), Fort Durham (1840), and Fort Victoria (1843).Simpson, George, ABC BookWorld American disadvantage It was not easy for the HBC to drive the Americans away from the North West Coast. The Americans had decades of experience and knew the coast's complex physical and human geography. It took until 1835 for the HBC to gain this level of experience, but the Americans still had several advantages. For a number of reasons they were willing and able to pay high prices for furs‚Äîmuch higher than the HBC could match without taking large financial losses. The American ventures were global in scope. They tapped multiple markets of which the North West Coast was but one. By the 1820s American ships routinely spent years in the Pacific, making several voyages between various places such as California, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Canton. American ships were usually stocked with a surplus of trade goods intended for trade on the North West Coast. It was always best to get rid of any extra trade goods on the North West Coast, \\"dumping\\" them at any price, before leaving. They would use up stowage space that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The HBC therefore faced a major challenge even after they became experienced with the coast's geography and indigenous peoples. The American system not only raised the price of furs but also lowered the value of trade goods. Furthermore, the indigenous people knew that increased competition served their interests and gave them bargaining power. They had no desire to see the Americans abandon the coast trade. Therefore, the HBC had to not just match but exceed the prices paid by Americans if they hoped to drive the Americans away. Beaver fur prices on the coast could be many times what the HBC was paying in the interior. There was no hope of making a profit. In order to compete on the coast the HBC had to take large, long-term financial losses. The main advantage the HBC had over the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with a large amount of capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable‚Äîthe HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American- Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether. The HBC drastically reduced the price paid for furs, by 50% in many cases. By this time, however, the fur trade was in decline, both on the coast and the continent, due to a general depletion of fur-bearing animals, along with a reduction in the demand for beaver pelts. A financial panic in 1837 resulted in a general slump in the fur and China trade, bringing an end to a half-century boom. During the 1840s, the HBC closed most of their coastal trading posts, leaving the coast trade to just Fort Simpson and the Beaver, with the new depot at Fort Victoria anchoring the southern coast. Significance The half century or so of the maritime fur trade and the North West Coast trade enriched Boston shipowners, creating capital that helped New England's transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The trade stimulated the culture of North West Coast natives, made Hawaii famous and nearly overwhelmed the native Hawaiians with foreign influences. It played a role in increased commercial pressure on China at Canton. Fur bearing animals were devastated, especially sea otters. By 1850, sea otters were virtually extinct throughout the North West Coast and found only in the Aleutian Islands and California. Northwest Coast Callicum and Maquinna The maritime fur trade brought the natives of the Northwest Coast material prosperity, wealth, and technology. It enlarged and transformed intertribal relations, trade, and war, including the \\"coastalization\\" of inland natives. Many inland natives adopted potlatching and coastal descent systems.Gibson (1992), pp. 269‚Äì277 At first the trade caused a rise in the power of a few key chiefs such as Maquinna, Wickaninish, Tatoosh, Concomly (Madsaw), Kotlean (Sitka Tlingit), Kow (Kaigani Haidas), Cuneah (Coyac; Kiusta Haida), Legaic (Tsimshian), Woyala (Heiltsuk), and Cumshewa (Haida). This was followed by a proliferation of chiefs and a general debasement of chieftainship, in part due to widespread wealth, giving individual hunters the means to challenge the traditional chiefs. There was an increase in the frequency of potlatching, which was used by the nouveau riche in challenging the traditional chiefs. In response the hereditary clan chiefs defended their traditional powers through an increased use of noble ancestry names, totems, and crests, all validated by potlatches. The increase in trade, and new items had a significant impact on First Nations material cultures, seeing the rise of such traditions as fabric appliqu√© (Button Blankets), metalwork (Northwest Coast engraved silver jewelry originated around this time as native craftsmen learned to make jewelry from coins), and contributed to a cultural fluorescence with the advent of improved (iron) tools that saw the creative of more and larger carvings (a.k.a. 'totem poles'). New pigments available included vermilion, from China, that rapidly replaced earlier red pigments and can be seen on many artifacts from this era. Negative effects of the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest included waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished. The maritime trade also brought changes to the natives' traditional seasonal migration patterns and settlement locations. The coastal people were \\"cosmopolitanized\\", that is, they were incorporated into a global market economy. At first their main export was furs, later supplemented and replaced by salmon, lumber, and artwork. By the late 19th century the North West Coast was famous for its arts and crafts, especially large works like totem poles, causing a flourishing of indigenous art. The natives imported many western goods and soon became dependent on many, such as firearms and metal tools. Textiles became a vital trade item during the early maritime fur trade era. The value of furs caused a shift in native dress from furs to textiles, which was reinforced by the general depletion of fur animals. Firearms had both positive and negative effects. They made hunting much more efficient but also made warfare much more deadly. Russian America The Russians, unlike the British and Americans, endeavoured to convert the natives to Christianity. Many Aleuts joined the Russian Orthodox Church.A History and Introduction of the Orthodox Church in America, The Orthodox Church in America Russian missionaries founded a number of churches for the natives, such as the Church of the Holy Ascension in Unalaska. A notable Russian missionary was Saint Innocent of Alaska.Biography of St. Innocent of Alaska, The Orthodox Church in America For his work as a missionary, bishop, and later archbishop in Alaska and the Russian Far East he was canonized. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in North America was Saint Peter the Aleut.Martyr Peter the Aleut of Alaska, America, and San Francisco, The Orthodox Church in America Other important Russian missionaries include Herman of Alaska and Joasaph Bolotov.Haycox, pp. 94‚Äì96, 144‚Äì146 Hawaii The effect of the maritime fur trade on native Hawaiians was similar to that of the North West Coast natives, but more powerfully transformative. The Hawaiians were generally receptive to Western incursion and settlement. The rise of King Kamehameha I and the unification of the islands under his rule were made possible in part by the effects of the maritime fur trade and its larger Pacific scope. The influx of wealth and technology helped make the new Kingdom of Hawaii relatively strong, in political and economic terms.Gibson (1992), pp. 278‚Äì291 Many non-native foodstuffs were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands during the early trading era, including plants such as beans, cabbage, onions, squash, pumpkins, melons, and oranges, as well as cash crops like tobacco, cotton, and sugar. Animals introduced included cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Due to its high fertility Oahu became the most important of the islands. By the 1820s the population of Honolulu was over 10,000. The native Hawaiian population suffered waves of epidemic disease, including cholera. The availability of alcohol, especially grog and gin, led to widespread boozing and an increased use of traditional kava intoxication. These health issues, plus warfare related to the unification of the islands, droughts, and sandalwooding taking precedence over farming all contributed to an increase in famines and a general population decline. By 1850 the native population had dropped by perhaps 50%. South China The effect of the maritime fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main effect of the Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process. New England The maritime fur trade was, for the United States, a branch of the \\"East India\\" (Asian) trade based in Salem, Boston, Providence, New York City (Fanning & Coles), Philadelphia, and Baltimore. The trade focused on Asian ports such as Canton, Kolkata (Calcutta), Chennai (Madras), Manila, Jakarta (Batavia), and the islands of Mauritius and Sumatra. Goods exported included furs, rum, ammunition, ginseng, lumber, ice, salt, Spanish silver dollars, iron, tobacco, opium, and tar. Goods brought back from Asia included muslins, silks, nankeens, spices, cassia, chinaware (porcelain), tea, sugar, and drugs. The maritime fur trade was just one part of the overall system. As a whole the Asian trade had a significant effect on the early United States, especially New England. The accumulation of large amounts of capital in short time contributed to American industrial and manufacturing development, which was compounded by rapid population growth and technological advancements. In New England the textile industry rose to dominance in early to middle 19th century. In light of the decline of the fur trade and a post-Napoleonic depression in commerce, capital shifted \\"from wharf to waterfall\\", that is, from shipping ventures to textile mills (which were originally located where water power was available). The textile industry in turn had large effect on slavery in the United States, increasing the demand for cotton and helping make possible the rapid expansion of the cotton plantation system across the Deep South.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 118.) is a village in the Municipality of Brezovica in central Slovenia. The municipality is part of the traditional region of Inner Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Brezovica municipal site Geography Gorenja Brezovica is a ribbon village in the upper part of a dry karst valley with sinkholes that rises from the small Ponikve Karst Field in Dolenja Brezovica towards Middle Hill (; ) to the south. Houses in the village are arranged along the slope of Vrh Hill (), which rises to the northeast. Other wooded hills surround the village, including Lopata Hill () to the southeast with Gnojevec Hill () rising behind it, and Sleme Hill () to the southwest with Linte Hill () rising behind it. In the dry valley below the village there are field areas named Krnice, Platovi, and Velike Njive, and west of these is ≈†tanga Hill () with low-quality hay fields mowed once a year. An intermittent pond lies along the road to Rakitna. Above it, in the area known as Preval, is Napajalna Spring (now abandoned), and Podobnica Spring lies below Lopata Hill. There are several caves in the area. Name The name Gorenja Brezovica literally means 'upper Brezovica', distinguishing the village from neighboring Dolenja Brezovica (literally, 'lower Brezovica'). The names Brezovica, Brezje, and names like them are relatively common in Slovenia and in other Slavic countries (e.g., B≈ôezovice in the Czech Republic, Brezovica in Serbia, etc.). The Slovene names Brezovica and Brezje are derived from the common noun breza 'birch'. Like similar toponyms in Slovenia (e.g., Brezova, Brezovec, Brezovci), it originally referred to the local vegetation. In the local dialect, the village is known as Gornja Brezovica. History During the Second World War, Italian forces set up a post in the village during the Rog Offensive in the summer of 1942. The local people took refuge during the war in Cerk Cave () on Lopata Hill and also in a smaller cave in the Rutar Commons ().

The population is 11923 as of 2012.Turksat  Etymology and History  The former name of the town is Gilindire. There are two theories about the origin of this name. The town shares the same name with the river at the east side of the town. The earliest reference to the river can be found in Evliya √áelebi‚Äôs Seyahatname of 1671 with the name Gelendir. According to the other theory the name began to be used as recently as 19th century. It is known that the village had been established by Oghuz Turks (Turkmens) who had migrated from Aydƒ±ncƒ±k district of Mersin in the 19th century. The Turkmens used the former name of Aydƒ±ncƒ±k (which was Kelenderis) for their new home. But later the name of a spring around the village came to be used both for the village and for the river. (Kargƒ±pƒ±narƒ± ) The population of the village increased in the first half of the 20th century and Kargƒ±pƒ±narƒ± was declared as a seat of township in 1969.  Economy  The major economic activity is agriculture. Kargƒ±pƒ±narƒ± is one of the most important citrus producers of Mersin Province and Mersin Province is the most important citrus producer of Turkey. Other crops such as tomatoes and cucumbers are also produced. The citrus plantation is mostly on the north of the town.

The festival is organized by the Arela Cultural Association and coordinated by the scriptwriter Alfonso Pato. The festival takes over the whole village; Barns and basements change their normal uses to become cinema screens and the audience are ferried by locals to and from the screenings on two-wheel tractors, known locally as chimp√≠ns. Other free activities are also available to the public: concerts, parades and hiking routes. Background The Cans Festival is celebrated every year in the parish of Cans (O Porri√±o, Pontevedra Spain), which has an official population of 400 inhabitants although during the festival that number rises to more than 10,000 people. Its symbols of identity are the peculiar cinema rooms: sheds, basements, empty houses, wine cellars and even henhouses transferred altruistically by their owners who devote themselves to the festival and collaborate in everything they can. Short film is the genre par excellence in Cans, and every year the festival official section shows the best Galician productions of the season. But Cans is something else than a short film festival: it has documentaries and full-length films premiers, a video clip contest, talks with prestigious filmmakers, presentations of experimental productions like web series, training programs for AV students, etc. History Cans Festival was born in 2004, as a kind of joke. The phonetic similarity between Cans (which also means dogs in Galician language) and Cannes was in the mind of some visionaries from a long time ago. In that year they decided to join forces and ideas and set in motion an event that would coincide in time with the glamorous Cote d'azur festival: Cannes. But that was a long time ago and from this funny word game a serious film festival emerged. Nowadays, Cans Festival is in the epicenter of the worldwide filming earthquake that takes place in May, with or without the consent of its French half- brother Cannes. It has also red carpet and movie stars, but unlike Cannes, here actors, actresses, filmmakers or scriptwriters mix with a heterogeneous public who can easily address them. Filmmakers, film directors, musicians, actors and actress like Isabel Coixet, Juanma Bajo Ulloa, Fernando Le√≥n, Manuel Mart√≠n Cuenca, Patricia Ferreira, Luis Tosar, Trist√°n Ulloa, Mabel Rivera, Mar√≠a Pujalte, Jos√© Sacrist√°n, Xoel L√≥pez, Kiko Veneno, Iv√°n Ferreiro, Coque Malla, Javier Krahe, Manuel Rivas, Luc√≠a Echevarr√≠a, Suso de Toro, El Gran Wyoming, Tet√© Delgado, Antonio Dur√°n \\"Morris\\", Juli√°n Hern√°ndez or Emma Su√°rez have been in Festival de Cans as guests, rewarded or speakers.

He spent some of his time in the period taking art classes, and studying engineering with Henry Allen, design engineer for the prominent firm of Johns & Waygood. In 1931 he also married local girl Margaret Lambie, and the couple had two sons, John and Earl. Architectural career With the help of his mother and his father-in- law as clients, he began designing apartment blocks, especially in the Elwood area, eventually completing perhaps about 18 in that suburb alone. His early output was prolific, including houses, flats and maisonettes in Brighton, Caulfield, Armadale, Malvern, Kew and Middle Park, and his own house (demolished) in Sandringham. His early designs were occasionally Tudor Revival, but he also developed his own distinctive style, that combined Arts & Crafts and Prairie Style influences, employing panels of horizontal banded tapestry bricks and his own unique angular balusters. Starting with Windermere in 1936, many of his designs were strikingly Moderne; they featured dynamic compositions of contrasting horizontals and verticals, often with thrusting semi-circular ended balconies or window bays. The projects for his relatives began with the conversion of the family home Chenier, into flats in 1934 for his mother; a later project was the 1939 beach front flats at 751 Ormond Esplanade named St Kiernan's, a play on his mother's maiden name Keirnan. In 1948 the name St Kiernan's was transferred to another block of flats designed by Esmond at 57 Ormond Esplanade (an interesting Modernist design with huge picture windows), but neither block is now known by that name. St Kiernan's flats, Port Philip Heritage Review In 1940 he designed the Garden Court flats on Marine Parade for his father-in-law, John Robert Lambie, who lived there for the next 20 years. World War II Esmond Dorney's career as an architect was interrupted by World War 2, when he enlisted and served as a pilot in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1940-1945. At the fall of Singapore, he was redeployed to Java and worked behind Japanese lines, establishing secret radar installations. Spending some time in a POW camp, he eventually escaped and remained with Chinese guerillas until the end of the war. This period of forced design inactivity generated a revolution in his architecture. Post World War II Dorney returned to Australia, and moved from his home in Melbourne to Hobart, Tasmania, citing health and personal reasons. He designed a series of remarkable houses, beginning with his first tiny, circular house on the Fort Nelson constructed in 1949,J.H.E. Dorney Trust records and became the most noted post-war modernist architect in his adopted state. He did however continue to work in Victoria, designing amongst other projects Sandringham Hospital (1956-64), Caritas Cristi Hospice (with Stephenson and Turner)(1962).J.H.E. Dorney Trust records His post war modernist projects in Tasmania included a number of innovative designs; his own houses at Fort Nelson were based on a circular plan (1949, 1966, both destroyed my fire, with the send house rebuilt in 1978), and another version of the circular plan is the Richardson House (1954) The Young House (1958) is one of his best known, with a structure of wide arches, a theme repeated on the Tate House (1960). The Jarvis House (1959) has a unique roof composed of a series of shallow arches, an idea repeated on the Thomas House (1960). Other notable designs include the arch-roofed St Pius X Church (1957), and opposing skillion roofs of Snows Dry Cleaners (1960). Other and later houses were more conventional, but usually with refined slim lines and details. His last house was the Fisher House (1989), completed after his death in 1991.J.H.E.Dorney Trust records Notable works Windermere, Esplanade Elwood  Windermere  The Windermere flats at 49 Broadway, Elwood were built in 1936. This celebrated block of flats in the Moderne style, with a dynamic interplay or horizontals, verticals and projecting curved balconies, creating a striking street presence, is one of the earliest Moderne flats added to the Victorian Heritage Register, in 1992.  St Kiernan's Flats  This striking block of flats at 51 Ormond Esplanade was constructed in 1939, and like Windermere employs a complexity of horizontals and verticals, but uses only rectilinear elements, including long horizontal windows, some wrapping around corners, reminiscent of European modernist design. The triple fronted fa√ßade is composed of a north and south wing and a projected central portion featuring a large brick chimney giving the building a strong vertical element. In 2018 St Kiernan's was completely facaded, leaving only the main exterior walls, and new flats with different arrangements built behind.  Dalcrombie  Long mis-attributed to Harry Norris, this is possibly the most extraordinary Moderne private house in Victoria. Located on a large estate in the hills outside Melbourne at 11 Warwick Farm Rd, Olinda, it was built in c1939 for optometrist Earl Coles, a partner in the then well known optometrists Coles & Garrard, and originally called Lanhydrock. The design exploits reinforced concrete to an unusual degree, with boldly cantilevered semi-circular window bays and an extensive first floor deck supported on just a few columns, allowing wide window openings below, and a tall circular stair tower largely composed of glass blocks. The house features multiple projecting semi-circular elements, a favoured element of Dorney's Moderne designs, projecting out from a central cuboid volume, with attached vertical elements, to create an elaborate dynamic composition. A large 1980s single storey addition to the north side features an almost matching projecting semi-circular window element, adding to the complexity.  The Young House  Built in 1959 in the Hobart suburb of Sandy Bay, this was Dorney's most widely celebrated residential projects before his own house became publicly accessible. It is popularly known as the 'Butterfly House' because the most striking feature is the use of a long low steel arch which forms both roof shape and structure, with a secondary half arch rising from the centre in the opposite direction. Listed by Heritage Tasmania, internal alterations were permitted in 1999, and additions in 2009, in part because the family wished to keep occupying the house they enjoyed, the alterations were sympathetic, and because they were \\"based on the principles found in the existing house and in Dorney‚Äôs own writings...\\", for instance that \\"A house should be planned like a machine, but a home is much more than a machine, and can in many ways express its owner‚Äôs personality.\\"  Dorney House  Probably Dorney's most well-known and celebrated design, \\"one of the great modern houses of Australia\\", is his own house built on the circular foundations of the former Fort Nelson gun emplacements in the foothills of Mount Nelson, south of central Hobart. First constructed in 1966, it was destroyed by bushfire and redesigned in 1978. The design centres on an exploded radial form of 12 sides, each segment with an arched roofed, creating a flower like form. Supported on a light steel frame, the north, the east and much of the south and west is fully glazed, providing the living spaces with panoramic views over the city of Hobart, the harbour, the Derwent estuary and Storm Bay and the Southern OceanJ.H.E.Dorney Trust Archive. The City of Hobart purchased the house and site in 2006, and it has been opened occasionally for events and is available for public booking. The City Council is exploring options for a more permanent use for the house and land.

Kilcoy Castle is a ‚ÄòZ‚Äô plan fortalice dating from no later than 1618 and possibly founded as early as 1580 (contemporary with Dalcross Castle QV). History The castle was built beginning as early as 1580 by the Stewart family, and completed by Alexander Mackenzie, third son of Colin Cam Mackenzie of Kintail around 1618. As a result of his marriage (contract 15 August 1611) to the widow of Sir James Stewart of Kilcoy, he had a charter of the lands of Kilcoy dated 18 July 1616 and a further charter of the Barony of Kilcoy dated 29 January 1618. The estates passed through the male line of the Mackenzies of Kilcoy until the death in 1883 of Sir Evan Mackenzie, 2nd Baronet, when they were inherited by his eldest daughter, who married a Colonel Burton.Alexander Mackenzie, History of the clan Mackenzie (A & W Mackenzie, 1879), at page 433 It fell into a ruinous state during the late 18th and 19th Centuries and was restored in 1891 by the Inverness Architects Ross and McBeth, who added a four-storey wing to the north. The castle was restored from a ruinous condition in about 1891. Construction The castle is a Z-plan tower house. It has four storeys with two round corner towers. The slated roof has crow-stepped gables and (probably late 17th century) dormer-head windows. There are many gun loops.The Gazetteer for Scotland (accessed on 15 April 2010) Present day The castle has been recently sold to relations of the original Stewart builders of Kilcoy. Its gardens are periodically open to the public under Scotland‚Äôs Gardens Scheme.The Menkings of Kilcoy maintain the Castle as their official residence but are rarely in residence. The castle is used primarily for evangelical and charitable purposes and regularly hosts events for a variety of Christian and local charities. The current feudal Baron of Kilcoy is heir to the feudal Lordship of the Garioch (in Aberdeenshire) currently held by George David Menking of Garioch. The Garioch Charitable Trust holds its annual trustee meetings at the castle.

Biography Timasius was a Roman officer, serving under the command of Emperor Valens (r. 364‚Äì378), who survived the Battle of Adrianople (378), in which the Roman emperor lost his life.. Emperor Theodosius I appointed Timasius magister equitum in 386 and magister peditum in 388.. During his tenure as magister militum praesentalis (386‚Äì395),. Timasius was made a consul, along with Promotus, in 389.: \\"...Fl. Timasius, consul in 389. The name of Timasius' wife, Pentadia, points clearly to a Gallic origin; their son, a young man by 395, was called Syagrius.\\" In 391, he followed Theodosius in the campaign against the barbarians in Macedonia. In that same year, Theodosius was on the verge of annihilating some barbarian units that were hiding in Roman territory when Timasius told him that the troops needed food and rest; the Roman soldiers, numbed into a slumber by too much food and drink, were taken by surprise and even Theodosius was almost taken prisoner.. When Theodosius returned to Constantinople, there was a clash between Timasius and his colleague Promotus and the powerful Rufinus; Theodosius sided with Rufinus, who arranged for Promotus's death.. Timasius also fought in the Battle of the Frigidus of 394, against the usurper Eugenius, as commander-in- chief of the Roman troops, but with the collaboration of Stilicho.. After the victory, he returned to the East.. In 395, Theodosius died and his son Arcadius (r. 395‚Äì408) had succeeded him on the Eastern throne. The following year, Timasius was the victim of a purge of Theodosius's generals orchestrated by the powerful eunuch Eutropius to get rid of potential opponents.. Eutropius specifically forced Bargus, a Syrian sausage-seller brought by Timasius from Sardis and later made tribunus(?) of the East, to falsely accuse Timasius of high treason.; . As a result, Timasius was put on trial and the judge, Saturninus, exiled him in 396 to the Kharga Oasis of the Libyan Desert.; ; . Slightly conflicting accounts report that Timasius was either unable to escape from the oasis or that his attempted escape led him to his death on the border between Egypt and Libya. .

He made his debut on 26 August 1922 in a 3‚Äì1 defeat away to Halifax Town in the Third Division North. This was Griffiths' only season with Lincoln City, and he finished as joint leading scorer alongside Harry Pringle, though the pair scored only seven goals apiece. He then returned to the north-east of England where he played for Jarrow of the North Eastern League and made one further Football League appearance, for Ashington in the 1923‚Äì24 season. He was later employed at a colliery. He died in Morpeth, aged 81.

History Miles Away was formed in mid-2002 by Cam Jose and Adam Crowe who had a bunch of songs they wanted to use for an old school hardcore band. They then drafted in Chris Unsworth, the drummer from Adam's first band Alleged and Perth stalwart/enigma Dion, formerly of Boredumb and From The Ruins to play the bass. Nick Horsnell joined up on vocals in late 2002 to complete the puzzle. At this time the band was going under the name Burning Bridges, until they found a US band with the same name. With each of the members big fans of the mid to late 1990s positive old school hardcore comeback (i.e. Floorpunch, Ten Yard Fight, In My Eyes, Reach The Sky, Fastbreak etc.) the aim was to create a band that kids could stage dive and finger point to, while also fusing in elements of new school hardcore. Miles Away recorded their 2010 album Endless Roads with producer Dean Baltulonis (Sick of It All, American Nightmare, No Warning, Modern Life is War) at The Wild Arctic Recording Studio in New York City. The album was released in August through Resist Records (Australia) and Anchors Aweigh Records (Europe). Before Endless Roads was released, Miles Away began recording the Memory Embraced 7\\" which include two new songs that did not appear on the new record, which they are self-releasing. Ash Pederick decided to leave the band and focus on his own project in Blkout. Colton Vaughan Jolliffe (formally of Perth hardcore act Something More) is currently filling in on bass while the band is on tour. It is unclear if he will become a permanent member of the band and did not take part in the recording of Endless Roads (It is believed that as per the demo, Adam recorded the bass tracks for the new record). Miles Away will hit the road harder than ever in preparation for the release starting in June with a full Australian tour with fellow Perth friends and Resist Records label mates, Break Even, Melbourne's Hopeless and The Broderick as part of \\"The I'd Rather Be Giggin' Tour\\" to be followed by a European tour with Cruel Hand and The Carrier. Since the release of Endless Roads, last five years have been spent growing, learning, touring, loving, celebrating and living. Five years ago, Miles Away released their last full-length album, \\"Endless Roads\\" and now they return with a new follow up LP titled, \\"Tide\\". Proving distance is no divide when it comes to songwriting, now Berlin based guitarist Adam Crowe collaborated electronically with Cam Jose on the song writing and structure for the new album, trading riffs and ideas via email. The process was slow going, not because of their residential locations, but due to a desire to fine-tune the song writing process and produce a record they all can be proud of for years to come. When it came to enlisting help to record, Miles Away, have a myriad of friends from all corners of the globe to call upon with former Defeater drummer Andy Reitz agreeing to lay down drum tracks on the album, while joining the band on bass is Adam's younger brother Jared Crowe of Perth outfit, The Others. Together they entered Getaway Studios in Boston with producer Jay Maas during July/August 2014, with the end result then mastered by Brad Boatright at Audiosiege. Pitching in on backing vocals are Zach from Bane, Jake from Dreamtigers, Dahei from Japanese band Cleave and renowned Aussie crooner Jamie Hay who put in time with A Death in the Family, Pitfall and Conation.

O;Neill, Frances. \\"Everett, Percy Edgar (1888 - 1967)\\" The Australian Dictionary of Biography, 2006 viewed 01/04/2010. His most well known design is the Police Headquarters at Russell Street (1940‚Äì1943), giving Melbourne ‚Äúits first Gotham City silhouette‚Äù. Percy Edgar Everett's signature style reflected and often combined a range of sources including American Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, and European early Modernism, such as Brick Expressionism, the German Bauhaus and even Russian Constructivism, drawn from magazines and his two trips abroad. He was also adept at designing in historicist, domestic and rustic styles when aproropriate. Early life Everett was born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. His father, Joseph Everett was a blacksmith from England. Joseph established a coach-building business, as well as building business later on, for which Percy assisted with detailed aspect of the buildings. The Australian Builder, The Official Journal of The Master Builders Association of Victoria, May 1950, Vol.2 no.5, p235 & p239, The Master Builders Association of Victoria, Melbourne He received his early education in Ashby Public School. The two subjects that drew most of his attention during his time at Ashby were drawing and piano lessons. It was there he first tried his hand at sketching. Among his early subjects were ships, figureheads, and sailors, suggesting the kind of environment he was born into. Early career in Geelong His interest in drawing, and his experience in the building industry,\\"Old Yarra Street Pier \\". Geelong official website. led him to architecture as his first career choice, with music as a second choice. Everett gained experience with Geelong architect W. H. Cleverdon and then became the first architecture student to enrol in the Gordon Technical College, under the dynamic leadership of George R. King, who established architectural section at the college. Everett graduated in 1906 and began his career as a graduate architect. The Australian Builder, The Official Journal of The Master Builders Association of Victoria, Apr 1952, Vol.4 no.4, p225 & p288, The Master Builders Association of Victoria, Melbourne Everett first worked at the Geelong Harbor Trust (1907‚Äì1910), where he planned and supervised his first structure, a wool store, and also designed the Edwardian- style \\"Sailors Rest\\" building on the Geelong foreshore. He then worked for the firm of Seeley & King, forming a partnership with them two years later. Seeley, King & Everett was his first private practice.Argus, Planner quits as dream is coming true, Melbourne, 26 June 1953 The practice was taken over by the firm of Laird and Buchan while Everett was on a trip to Britain and Europe in 1913. In 1914, when still connected with Laird and Buchan, he opened a separate practice in Melbourne, but since there was a shortage of architectural work due to the First World War, he took up the post of principal of the Brunswick Technical School (1916). He also continued his association with Laird & Buchan, with whom he designed the elaborate bandstand in Johnstone Park, Geelong, which was constructed in 1919. That same year, the association also designed the Edwardian-Baroque Peace Memorial, on the axis of the bandstand, as well as redesigning the park in a more formal manner.Argus, Chief Government Architect, Melbourne, 3 July 1934 The revamped park and memorial were completed in 1926. In 1930, like many other Australian architects during the Great Depression, he undertook a world tour including the US and the UK, but unusually also included the USSR. In 1932 he was appointed headmaster of Brighton Technical School. Public Works Department RMIT Building 9, 1938 Shepparton Court House, 1938 Geelong Court House, 1938 Chemistry School, University of Melbourne, 1938 Zoo melb entrance 1940 Frank Tate Building, University of Melbourne, 1940 Russell Street Police Headquarters, 1940-43 Gordon Technical School, Textile College, 1947 Two years later, in 1934, Everett was appointed Chief Architect of the Victorian Public Works Department (PWD). This was an extremely important position, making him responsible for the design of the State's public buildings. This included new state offices, courthouses, police stations, hospitals (including tuberculosis (TB) sanatoriums and mental hospitals), schools, colleges, and even some leisure facilities on public land. Much of the output was additional buildings or wings expanding existing institutions. The designs produced by the PWD, where he insisted on absolute control over the designs, immediately changed from the polite simplified red brick Georgian of the 1920s to mostly dramatic modernist compositions. The first buildings to be completed by the office under his direction included the Streamline Moderne Drouin Primary School, and the Amsterdam School style Yallourn Technical School (demolished), which both opened in 1936. Under his direction, the PWD went on to create a range of modernist designs for numerous high-profile public buildings, with a large number built between 1936 and 1941, only slowing down as World War II restrictions came into force. Essendon Technical School (1939), Camberwell Court House (1939) and the William Angliss College (1940) are considered amongst the best of this period, and are all on the Victorian Heritage Register. Influences from various strains of Modernism can be discerned, including the 1920s Amsterdam School, the German Bauhaus and Brick Expressionism, and even 1920s Russian Constructivism. Some projects were influenced by the US skyscraper style, including the outstanding Russell Street Police Headquarters (1940‚Äì43) and the smaller Ballarat State Offices (1941). The curved and sweeping lines of the Streamlined Moderne was another influence, often used for the sometimes long school buildings and hospital wings, while a more typical Art Deco approach was also used, notably for the Shepparton Courthouse and Wangaratta Courthouse and State Offices, both of 1938. Everett, like all interwar architects, could also create historicist or domestic styles when it seemed appropriate. Examples include the rustic style Yarra Bend Golf House (1936), the Mediterranean influenced Geelong Court House (1938), and the Collegiate Gothic Melbourne University Chemistry School (1938). The many smaller police stations were quite domestic in character, with pitched roofs and simple detailing. In 1945, Everett went to North America to study recent trends in public architecture, but after WWII the style of buildings produced under his direction did not change. As public buildings were given priority, numerous public buildings with his distinctive flair, such as the TB wing at Hamilton Base Hospital (1945), Caulfield Institute of Technology (1947), and large TB Sanatoria at Heatherton and Greenvale (both 1946, now demolished) were major projects in the post war years. By then however, architectural progressives were calling for a more truly modern approach, as distinct from Everett's devotion to dynamic effects. One of many governmental projects the PWD executed at this time was the dramatic Department of Agriculture annexe to the 19th century Italianate State Government offices, built in 1948 (demolished 1997). The building housed sections for photography, films and radio, as well as a small cinema, because film and radio were seen as significant new methods of helping to educate and inform farmers. It also showed his interest in dominating older buildings, while at the same time responding to their layout. His 1940s additions and alterations at the Gordon Technical College in his native Geelong also display this approach. One Everett design however did display some true innovation at this time; while still not reflecting the postwar International Style he developed a new prototype for primary schools based on hexagonal classrooms. Built in cream brick, with large timber window-walls and clerestory windows, they were designed to provide the largest floor area with a minimum of materials, and the ability for all pupils to be close to the teacher. Extant examples remain at North Balwyn (1950), Solway (Ashburton) (1950), Red Hill Consolidated (1951), and North Coburg (1952). Everett retired as chief architect in June 1953, but continued in private practice until the late 1950s. Personal life Everett married twice. On 11 June 1924 he married Georgina Buchanan Arthur (n√©e Boyd), a widow, at Mentone, Victoria. Following her death in 1956, he married Mavis Delgany Stewart (n√©e Richards), also a widow, at Brighton, Victoria, on 26 June 1956. He had two step-children. Everett died at Brighton Beach, Victoria on 6 May 1967.

Football career Pringle was born in Perkinsville, County Durham. He began his football career with Craghead United, and was briefly on the books of Arsenal before returning to the north- east to play for Chester-le-Street Town. In 1922, Pringle joined Lincoln City. He made his debut on 26 August 1922 in a 3‚Äì1 defeat away to Halifax Town in the Football League Third Division North. Pringle finished the 1922‚Äì23 season as the club's joint leading scorer alongside Tommy Griffiths, though the pair scored only seven goals apiece. Two years later, Pringle was again Lincoln's top scorer, with 15 goals from League and FA Cup games. In all, he remained with the club for twelve seasons, becoming the first player to play in more than 300 League and FA Cup games for Lincoln City, finishing with 64 goals from 315 games, and set a club record (since broken) of 292 appearances in the Football League. He married the daughter of a director of the club. His playing style was described as that of \\"an enthusiastic team man, a hard working forager and provider for others, but never a great shot. His best displays have been given on heavy grounds, as apparently he experiences some difficulty in controlling a light ball.\\" Pringle left Lincoln City in 1934 to become Grantham's first player-manager. As player, he scored on his debut in the Midland League, and played at least occasionally until 1940. As manager, he led the club to the First Round Proper of the 1935‚Äì36 FA Cup, and won the Lincolnshire Senior Cup in 1937 for only the second time in the club's history. However, Grantham's financial problems meant he stepped down as manager at the start of the 1937‚Äì38 season, but stayed with the club as trainer for a further 14 years. During the 1950s Pringle acted as trainer for the works team of Aveling Barford, the Grantham-based manufacturer of steamrollers. Pringle died in Grantham in 1965 at the age of 64.

The Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta, otherwise known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta or SMOM is a Roman Catholic order based in Rome, Italy. The order takes its origins from the Knights Hospitaller, an organization founded in Jerusalem in 1050. Following the loss of Christian held territories of the Holy Land to Muslims, the Order operated from Rhodes (1310‚Äì1523), and later from Malta (1530‚Äì1798), over which it was sovereign. Order's postal service in Malta The Casa del Commun Tesoro, which housed the Order's post office in Malta from 1708 to 1798 When the Maltese islands were administered by the Order, the knights set up a postal service. The earliest known letter is dated 14 June 1532, and it was sent from Grandmaster l'Isle Adam to , the Bishop of Auxerre, who was also the French ambassador in Rome. The first proper postal service was set up in 1708, and the service was carried out at the Casa del Commun Tesoro in Valletta. The first postal markings on Maltese mail appeared later on in the 18th century, sometime between 1755 and 1791.  Stamps  A miniature sheet issued by the SMOM in 2004 The postal administration of the order, known as the Poste Magistrali, was instituted on 20 May 1966 under a Decree of the Grand Master of the order and the first stamps were issued on 15 November 1966. Until recently the stamps were denominated in the currency of the order which was Scudi, Grani and Tari, which roughly equated to the currency of Malta before it joined the Eurozone; 1 scudo = 12 tari = 240 grani = 12 Maltese cents.Said, Godwin., ed. Said S.M.O.M. Stamp and Coin Catalogue 1996. Valletta, Malta: Said International Ltd., 1996. Since 1 January 2005 the stamps have been denominated in euros.https://www.orderofmalta.int/associate-countries/ Retrieved 3 October 2017. The stamps are inscribed Poste Magistrali and bear one or more small Maltese Crosses. Early issues were printed by De La Rue, but today a variety of Maltese and Italian printers are used. As well as postage stamps, the Order has produced aerogrammes, maximum cards, first day covers, miniature sheets, postage due stamps and postcards with imprinted stamps. Each year, one stamp issue is devoted to St. John the Baptist, who is the Order's Patron Saint, and one to the celebration of Christmas.  Status  Post boxes of the SMOM at their headquarters in Rome The stamps are issued for both postal and charitable reasons. Despite over 50 bi-lateral postal agreements the stamps are usually classed as cinderella stamps as they do not have postal validity throughout the world. Most postal agreements are with countries in which the order does charitable work. The SMOM is not a member of the Universal Postal Union.UPU membership list. Retrieved 23.04.10.

Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 104. is a settlement in the Municipality of Brezovica in central Slovenia. It lies in the marshlands south of the capital Ljubljana. The municipality is part of the traditional region of Inner Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Brezovica municipal site It includes the hamlets of Pri Ljubljanici (along the road to Log pri Brezovici), Pod Kamnom (on both sides of the railroad tracks near the railroad station), Vrtovi (below the railroad tracks), Gmajna (in the marsh to the northeast), and ≈Ωabnica (below Ple≈°ivica Hill). Name The name Notranje Gorice literally means 'inner hills', referring to a cluster of hills in the Ljubljana Marsh: Ple≈°ivica Hill, Big Peak (), Gulƒç Hill, and others. The name distinguishes the settlement from neighboring Vnanje Gorice (literally, 'outer hills') to the northeast. The name is derived from the Slovene common noun gorica 'hill', a diminutive of gora 'mountain'. The settlement was known as Innergoritz in German in the past. History The remnants of Bronze Age stilt houses were discovered behind the Oblak house in Notranje Gorice in 1907 and 1908, testifying to early settlement of the area. Additional prehistoric finds include a boat discovered at the Mrak farm in 1932 and additional stilt houses in 1953 while regulating the Ku≈°lan Canal. The former bed of the Ljubljanica River, which was rerouted to Podpeƒç by the Romans, runs through the southern part of the settlement. The settlement was attested in written sources in 1197 and 1202 as a property of St. Paul's Abbey in Carinthia. Schooling was established in 1902, and a schoolhouse was built in 1905 (and renovated in 1928). During the Second World War, Italian forces burned several houses in the settlement. A monument along the road to Podpeƒç marks the site where 11 hostages were shot during the war. Church The local parish church is dedicated to Saint Martin and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. It was first mentioned in 1453, but the current building was extensively rebuilt in 1861.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 1674 The main altar was created by Celestin Mis using Baroque statuary.

The Scots under James Douglas led a raid into Weardale, and Roger Mortimer, 3rd Baron Mortimer, accompanied by the newly crowned Edward III on his first campaign, led an army to drive them back. Douglas led, among other ambushes, an attack into the English camp, with 500 cavalry, and almost captured the king.  The opening moves  At the beginning of June 1327, a state of truce existed between England and Scotland but it was clear it would not last. Truce negotiations broke down and by 15 June, Scots forces had crossed over into the English West March. An English army, including a large contingent of Hainaut mercenaries (amongst whom was the chronicler Jean Le Bel), set out from York on 1 July to make a counter invasion of Scotland.McNamee (1997), p.241 On 15 July, they were in Durham. It was here that they saw smoke from burning farms in the surrounding countryside and realised that a second Scottish force had entered the English Eastern March and was close by. The English army pursued the Scots but could not make contact and eventually lost touch with them. At this point, the English changed their tactics and, instead of trying to overtake the Scots, decided to position themselves to intercept the Scottish army heading back into Scotland. Accordingly, they marched to Haydon, where they crossed the River Tyne and encamped on 20 July. Here they stayed waiting for the Scots for a week. However, at the end of this time they realised that they would have to seek out the Scots. A party of men-at-arms was sent out to search for the Scots and the main army marched off again southward. On 30 July, they were met by one of their scouts, Thomas Rokesby, who had blundered into the Scots army and been captured by them. The Scots had released him on condition that he rode back and directed the English army to them. The English followed Rokesby and located the Scots near Stanhope in Durham.  The Scottish position  The Scots had taken up a strong defensive position by the River Wear. The position was too strong for the English to attack but they attempted to get the Scots to fight by drawing up their army on level ground and inviting the Scots to fight and by skirmishing with men-at-arms and archers. Douglas sent them the message that they would stay where they were as long as they liked. This stand-off lasted for three days. On the night of 2‚Äì3 August, the Scots decamped overnight moving a short way to a better position within Stanhope Park proper. The English shifted camp to be nearer the Scots.Rogers (2000), pp.19‚Äì21  The night raid  On the night of 3‚Äì4 August, Douglas led a night attack on the English camp. Douglas reached Edward III's tent which was collapsed with him inside and nearly captured the English king. Several hundred English were killed. The English were forced to keep constant improved watch after this. On the night of 6‚Äì7 August, the Scottish army quietly broke camp and headed back toward Scotland. The English did not pursue.Rogers (2000), pp. 21-22  Aftermath  Although militarily indecisive, the Weardale campaign was a strategic success for the Scots. Their preemptive invasion had stopped a more powerful English army from attacking Scotland. Their Fabian tactics had caused \\"great shame, dishonour and scorn\\" to the English.Anonimalle Brut, quoted by Rogers (2000), p.23 The political impact of the campaign was greater than the military. The campaign had been ruinously expensive for the English, costing about ¬£70,000, with the cost of the Hainauters alone being ¬£41,000.Rogers (2000), p.23 Unable to raise this sort of money again to resist another Scots incursion in 1328, the English were forced to negotiate, leading to the Treaty of Edinburgh‚ÄìNorthampton, which recognised Robert Bruce's claim to the throne of Scotland and dropped English claims of feudal superiority over the monarchs of Scotland.Rogers (2000) pp.24-25 ReferencesBibliography=Primary * Anglo-Scottish Relations, 1174‚Äì1328, Selected Documents, ed. and trans.

He represented Lyttelton in Parliament for 2¬Ω years and was a supporter of education in his later years. Born in Australia, he came to Canterbury in 1868. Early life=Australia  Webb was born in Sydney in 1829. His parents had arrived there on the ship Eliza in the previous year. He was educated at Sydney College. From an early age, he worked in the office of a business. Later on, he headed the merchant firm of Messrs Ferguson, Webb and Co. In 1851, he visited Auckland. He was married to Ann Vaile by special licence on 27 October 1853, at St. Paul's Church, Auckland, New Zealand by the Rev. T. F. Lloyd, M.A. She was the second daughter of the architect George Vaile. She died on 21 December 1854 at 6 Victoria Terrace, Millers Point, New South Wales. Webb was two years younger than John Thomas Peacock, who attended the same Sydney college. His second marriage was to one of Peacock's sisters Augusta Ann Peacock. He married her on 15 October 1857 at the Centenary Chapel, York Street, Sydney and emigrated to New Zealand in 1868.  New Zealand For some years prior to 1877, when the Lyttelton Harbour Board was formed, Webb was in charge of Peacock's Wharf in Lyttelton, so named after his brother in law. In 1880, he was appointed as manager to the Permanent Investment Association of Canterbury, a role which he held for ten years. He was a director of the Mutual Life Association of Australasia. Political career A by-election was held on 13 September 1869 for the Lyttelton seat of the Provincial Council following the resignation of Hugh Murray-Aynsley. Webb, although being new in the colony, was nominated. Since there were no other candidates, he was declared elected. He was represented on the Provincial Council until 1875, and was secretary during 1873‚Äì1875. In April 1873, his brother in law, Peacock, was appointed to the Legislative Council and thus had to resign his seat for the Lyttelton electorate in Parliament. A by-election was set for 19 May 1873, which Webb and Murray- Aynsley contested. Webb and Murray-Aynsley received 122 and 115 votes respectively, a majority of seven for Webb, who was thus declared elected. At the 28 December 1875 general election, the Lyttelton electorate was again contested by Webb and Murray-Aynsley. This time, Murray-Aynsley was the successful person, with a majority of 32 votes. Later life=Interests and memberships Te Wepu in 2011 In Sydney, he had been a member of the Horticultural and Agricultural Society of New South Wales. He continued this interest in Canterbury, studied botany, and was a member of the Christchurch Horticultural Society, including its chairman. He was a member of the Royal Microscopical Society of London, and was elected a Fellow in 1880 (hence his honorific suffix FRMS). Webb was very interested in education. He was on several education governance bodies. He was chairman of the Lyttelton School committee. He was one of the school commissioners for Canterbury for eighteen years. He was a member of the North Canterbury Board of Education for several years, including chairman. He was a member of the Canterbury College (what is these days the University of Canterbury) Board of Governors since its establishment in 1873, and was the chairman from 1894 up to the time of his death. He was a leading member of the Anglican Church and was on various committees, both on a local and national level. In the 1880s, he built a large residence 'Te Wepu' on Papanui Road, with an entrance off a side street that was named Webb Street. The house is used as a hotel and apartments these days and has been renamed Merivale Manor. The building is registered as Category II by Heritage New Zealand. Family Through his wife, a n√©e Peacock, Webb had three brothers in law as fellow Members of Parliament. John Evans Brown (1822‚Äì1907), known as \\"Yankee\\" Brown, married Webb's wife's sister Theresa Australia. Brown was from Pennsylvania and owned land north of the Waimakariri River inland from Kaiapoi, which he gave the Cherokee name of ‚ÄòSwannanoa‚Äô. Brown represented the Ashley electorate from 1871 to 1879, and the St Albans electorate from 1881 to 1884. Francis James Garrick (1833‚Äì1890) was also from Sydney and attended Sydney College. He married Webb's wife's oldest sister, Elizabeth. He came to New Zealand in 1864, and succeeded Brown in the St Albans electorate from 1884-87. And as outlined above, Webb succeeded his wife's brother John Thomas in the Lyttelton electorate in 1873 after his resignation due to his appointment to the Legislative Council. Webb's second daughter, Malvina Mary, married Robert McDougall (1860‚Äì1942), who was the benefactor of the Robert McDougall Art Gallery that opened in 1932. The McDougall residence Fitzroy was later gifted to Nurse Maud and is still in use as a hospital, located between Mansfield and McDougall Avenues. Death and commemoration  Webb died on 11 February 1901 at his residence in Merivale. He had been suffering from gastritis. He was survived by his wife, seven sons and two daughters. The bells of the Christ Church Cathedral were rung in his honour, and many flags were flown at half mast. He was buried at Papanui cemetery. Webb Street in Merivale carries his name. McDougall Avenue commemorates his daughter Malvina Mary's husband's name.

Worth mentioning is that the banned political group the Muslim Brotherhood were represented by one of their key figures who attended the meeting however their stand in accepting a non-member of their group as a candidate is yet unclear. It is also unknown whether Amr Moussa the head of the Arab League who met with Elbaradei a day earlier will be part of the new movement. The goal of the group is to bring about political reform based on democracy and social justice.  Platform  The main objectives of the association is to work towards a political system based on genuine democracy and social justice. The first step on this road is to ensure basic guarantees of free and fair elections involving all the Egyptians so that there is an equal opportunity for all the Egyptians to run and win any elections, whether legislative elections or the presidential election. The National Association for Change platform is: # Ending the state of emergency. # Complete judicial oversight of the whole election process. # Allowing local and international civil society groups to monitor elections. # Equal access to media for all candidates, particularly during presidential elections. # Giving Egyptians living abroad the right to vote at Egyptian embassies and consulates. # The right to run for president without arbitrary restrictions in accordance with Egypt's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as limiting the president's service to two terms. # Voting by the National ID.

The President of the Republic may be re-elected for other successive terms.\\". # Amending article 88 of the Constitution of Egypt that states: \\"The Law shall determine the conditions which members of the Assembly must fulfil as well as the rules of election and referendum, while the ballot shall be conducted under the supervision of the members of a judiciary organ.\\".  Activities of the Association = In Egypt  In Dakahlia = Activity started People's Campaign to support ElBaradei in Dakahlia in the first leg of some political activists and members of the April 6 Youth Movement individually to receive ElBaradei at the Cairo airport late February 2010.

With the increasing number of members of the campaign employed a human development coach to receive lectures on how to work together.  Outside Egypt  In the Arab States  In Kuwait  According to George Ishak, The online group had planned to hold its first meeting in public to launch the Kuwaiti branch of the Egyptian National Association for Change. Kuwaiti authorities deported 17 Egyptian nationals supporting potential Egyptian presidential candidate Mohamed ElBaradei in Kuwait City. They were among 33 Egyptians in Kuwait City who belonged to a pro-ElBaradei group on the social networking site Facebook and who were detained by Kuwaiti authorities. Kuwaiti officials said Egypt's internal politics should be kept in Egypt and not exercised abroad. The Egyptian political forces to staged a protest in front of the Embassy of Kuwait in Cairo. Gameela Ismail, an Egyptian journalist, said the demonstration comes to protest the practices of the Kuwaiti security forces and their arrest of the Egyptians because of their ad campaign to launch the Kuwaiti branch of the Egyptian National Association for Change. While ElBaradei described the Egyptians deportation from Kuwait \\"gross injustice\\". = In Europe  In England  A group of Egyptians who live in England supporting the peaceful change of the Constitution in Egypt towards more democratization. The group stands behind Dr Mohamed ElBaradei who champions this cause.National Association for Change: The UK branch = In North America  In The United States  Mr ElBaradei decided to visit the US during April 2010. Mr ElBaradei's visit to the United States will include meetings with Egyptians abroad to \\"discuss his agenda for change and answer their questions on how to move forward\\", said an official from Mr ElBaradei's National Association for Change. The trip could represent an opportunity for Mr ElBaradei to focus on one of the stated goals of his National Association for Change: the enfranchisement of Egyptians abroad, many of whom have felt for years that their views on governance are neglected by the regime. In the wake of the strong support for the National Association for Change in the United States, Egyptians living in the US formed the Egyptian Association For Change (EAC). The EAC priorities include a free and fair elections involving all Egyptians including the Egyptian Diaspora, and guarantees of freedom of expression and peaceful political participation. To meet these objectives, the EAC mobilizes communities and individuals to advocate for constitutional reforms and the implementation of specific measures to ensure fair and transparent elections in Egypt. While the EAC support the NAC's call for change and adopted the 7 points it has presented for reform, there is no formal relationship between the two organizations. However members of the EAC are in constant communication with the members of NAC to coordinate and synchronize positions and efforts. On May 1, 2010, Egyptians in America voted in a mock election organized by the EAC. For the first time ever, they participated in a free and fair Egyptian electoral process that included Hamdeen Sabahi, Mohamed ElBaradei, Ayman Nour, Amr Moussa and Gamal Mubarak as candidates. The EAC's main headquarters is in Washington, D.C., with chapters in NY/NJ, Massachusetts, North Carolina, California and Michigan. Egyptian expatriates may have a natural affinity for Mr ElBaradei, whose global cachet resonates with expatriates who hope to see a comprehensive rethinking of Egypt's political system.

A negative trion consists of two electrons and one hole and a positive trion consists of two holes and one electron. The trion itself is a quasiparticle and is somewhat similar to an exciton, which is a complex of one electron and one hole. The trion has a ground singlet state (spin s = 1/2) and an excited triplet state (s = 3/2). Here singlet and triplet degeneracies originate not from the whole system but from the two identical particles in it. The half- integer spin value distinguishes trions from excitons in many phenomena; for example, energy states of trions, but not excitons, are split in an applied magnetic field. Trion states were predicted theoretically in 1958; they were observed experimentally in 1993 in CdTe/Cd1‚àíxZnxTe quantum wells, and later in various other optically excited semiconductor structures. There are experimental proofs of their existence in nanotubes supported by theoretical studies. Despite numerous reports of experimental trion observations in different semiconductor heterostructures, there are serious concerns on the exact physical nature of the detected complexes. The originally foreseen 'true' trion particle has a delocalized wavefunction (at least at the scales of several Bohr radii) while recent studies reveal significant binding from charged impurities in real semiconductor quantum wells. Trions have been observed in atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors. In 2D materials the form of the interaction between charge carriers is modified by the nonlocal screening provided by the atoms in the layer. The interaction is approximately logarithmic at short range and of Coulomb 1/r form at long range. The diffusion Monte Carlo method has been used to obtain numerically exact results for the binding energies of trions in 2D semiconductors within the effective mass approximation.

It has persistent, stringy bark, green or greyish leaves with a bluish sheen, flower buds in groups of eleven to fifteen, white to cream-coloured flowers and crowded, flattened hemispherical fruit.E. agglomerata foliageE. agglomerata flower budsE. agglomerata fruit  Description  Eucalyptus agglomerata is a tree that grows to a height of and has thick, fibrous, stringy bark, usually colored grey over reddish brown. The leaves of young trees are green and broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, glossy green, wavy and hairy. Adult leaves are glabrous, lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, mostly long and wide. They are green to greyish green, a similar shade on both sides, more or less glossy with a bluish sheen. From a distance the leaves appear a bluish/green colour. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen on a flattened or angular peduncle long but the individual buds lack a pedicel. The mature buds are oblong or spindle- shaped, long and about wide with a conical operculum at least as long and wide as the floral cup. The flowers are white. Flowering mostly occurs between October and January and the fruit are crowded, flattened hemispherical, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus agglomerata was first formally described in 1922 by Joseph Maiden and the description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The type specimen was collected in 1896 by Maiden from Hill Top in the Southern Highlands district of New South Wales.Forest Trees of Australia, D.J. Boland et al. 1992 page 282 The specific epithet (agglomerata) is a Latin adjective meaning \\"balled\\" or \\"gathered into a mass\\", referring to the crowded fruit.  Distribution and habitat  Blue-leaved stringybark is often found on gentle to moderate slopes in the coastal and tableland areas, but it also grows on steep slopes in the Blue Mountains. The soils show a range of types, some of poor quality but mostly of good levels of sub soil moisture. Podosolic soils give best results. The soil types for E. agglomerata are mostly sedimentary, based on shales and sandstones, but sometimes slates. The climate for this species is mostly warm humid with rainfall ranges between 700 mm to 1500 mm per year. Frosts are common in the higher altitudes of its range, but absent on the lower coastal habitats. The average high temperature of the warmest month is between 25 and 31 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature range of the coolest month is from -2 to 6 degrees Celsius. Blue-leaved stringybark is found within 120 kilometres of the sea. It occurs in areas of eastern central and southern New South Wales, and is distributed as far north as Wauchope, to just south of the Victorian border into Croajingolong National Park. Ecology Blue-leaved stringybark is a koala food tree. A field study conducted in the Campbelltown district southwest of Sydney published in 2000 found that koalas preferred Blue-leaved Stringybark and Grey Gum but only when the two tree species were growing on shale-based rather than sandstone soils.  Use in horticulture  It is not often seen in cultivation but has potential as a windbreak or shelter tree.  Timber  The pale brown sapwood is resistant to lyctus borer. The light brown heartwood is of a moderate fine texture with some interlocking grain. The weight is 930 kilograms per cubic metre. It is slow drying and is used for general building construction and fencing.

His career saw works evolve from an International Modernist stance into a Regionalist aesthetic for which he became most recognized. Much of his significant works were composed of raw materials and considered ‚ÄòBrutalist‚Äô typifying Borland‚Äôs renowned motto ‚Äòarchitecture is not for the faint-hearted‚Äô. Borland died in 2000 leaving a legacy of work throughout Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania.thumb Formative years From 1938 to 1941 Borland attended University High School and at age 15 was offered a job as office hand at the studio of Best Overend, a pioneer of modernist architecture in Melbourne. That same year he began part-time tuition at the Melbourne Technical College studying Building Construction and Geometrical Drawing. In 1944 Borland attended first year of a Bachelor of Architecture degree at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing to join the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving in WWII from July 1945 to January 1947. Upon return Borland recommenced studies under the newly appointed tutors Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd. During these years Borland was an active member of the University branch of the CPA (Communist Party Australia) and the Melbourne University Labor Club. Borland‚Äôs belief in an idealistic society of economic, educative and social equality was intensified by his experiences at war and remained prevalent throughout his career and life.Kevin Borland Architecture From The Heart, Doug Evans with HC Borland and Conrad Hamann. RMIT University Press Borland received the Illuminating Engineers Society Student Award for Light in Architecture in 1949 and in 1950 graduated with second class honours in Town Planning. Career During 1951 and 1952 Borland worked for ‚Äòthe Age‚Äô Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Small Homes Service under former tutors Robin Boyd and Neil Clerehan. The service aimed to supply the general public with modest affordable architect- designed homes. Through the service Borland obtained his first two major domestic commissions. The second of these (and first completed) was the Rice House (1952‚Äì53), which used an innovative method of chicken wire reinforced concrete shells in a lightweight form of slender vaulting roofs. The design reflects Borland‚Äôs improvisation of medium, and a deep sense of Humanism, which he carried on throughout his career. Borland‚Äôs first public building, in collaboration with John and Phyllis Murphy, Peter McIntyre and engineering consultant Bill Irwin - the Olympic Swimming Stadium in Melbourne (1952‚Äì56) - precedes many collaborative projects for large institutional buildings. The scheme‚Äôs expression of primary structure reveals an idea of the interdependency of all building components. 1957 saw the beginning of the Borland & Trewenack practice which received recognition for works such as Mcarthy House, Stein House (1959), and Preshil Hall (1962). After 8 years Borland established an independent practice, and over the next decade became widely recognized, receiving numerous accolades for both residential and public commissions.

It is founded in the belief that involvement in sports at any level increases self-esteem, encourages independence and enhances quality of life. The Foundation does this by providing funding for training, competition, rehabilitation, and equipment for the challenged athletes. The Challenged Athletes Foundation is divided into four different programs: Access for Athletes, Operation Rebound, Catch a Rising Star, and Project N.Ex.T., all of which focus on the betterment of disabled athletes, but vary in their target group. Access for Athletes is the flagship program of CAF.  History  Challenged Athletes Foundation was founded in 1997 in response to below-knee-amputee endurance racer Jim MacLaren who suffered an accident while competing in a triathlon. In June 1993, while competing in a triathlon in Orange County, California, MacLaren was on his bike when a van went through a closed intersection, hit the back of the bike and propelled him into a pole. When he arrived at the hospital he was told that he was a quadriplegic and would never move again from the waist down.  Programs and Events = Programs  The following are programs which CAF offers or supports: *Access for Athletes ‚Äì this is CAF‚Äôs flagship program. It provides funding for equipment, training and travel expenses. In 2011, Access for Athletes satisfied 980 funding requests from challenged athletes in 45 U.S. states and 22 countries. The grants, totaling more than $1.4 million, were used by recipients ‚Äì of all ages, from beginners to elites ‚Äì to participate in 47 different sports. *Catch a Rising Star ‚Äì is a program that provides fun, interactive, nurturing clinics ‚Äì led by recognized experts and authorities ‚Äì that provide instruction in basic sports skills. These clinics, which include mentoring from elite CAF athletes, allow participants to develop the confidence and self-esteem required to reach their individual goals. In 2011, CAF held 23 clinics and camps across the United States, reaching 495 physically challenged athletes. *Reach High ‚Äì is a program provides information, resources and opportunities to people with physical challenges, enabling them to make informed decisions about health, lifestyle and medical choices. The program also raises awareness within the broader community about the abilities of athletes with physical challenges. *Operation Rebound ‚Äì CAF is a member organization of Operation Rebound, a sports and fitness program for American military personnel, veterans and first responders with permanent physical disabilities. In 2011, CAF Operation Rebound provided 240 grants injured troops and first responders and supported an additional 80 individuals through its Military Medical Center Physical Training Program and CAF events. *Project N.Ex.T. (New Expectations Today) ‚Äì is a three-year San Diego County pilot program that connects physically challenged mentees with similarly challenged mentors. By educating recently injured or inactive individuals about available fitness and sports opportunities, we believe we can create better and more consistent outcomes for Project N.Ex.T. participants.  Events  The Challenged Athletes Foundation holds a number of high-profile fund raising events in order to raise money to support disabled athletes to compete in sports. These include CAF events the San Diego Triathlon Challenge; Million Dollar Challenge; Heroes, Heart and Hope Gala held at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, Hawaii Revisited; Tour de Cove; Rock on the Green and numerous other events under the banner of Race for a Reason.  Athletes  The Challenged Athletes Foundation has enabled a number of disabled athletes to get to the starting line.

The name derives from Scottish Gaelic but is somewhat obscure in its current form. The first element is either c√πl (behind) or c√πil (nook) and the last element could be either eas (waterfall) or lios (enclosure, garden). The village or hamlet is set on a small hillock centred on a historic church. Due to rerouting of roads, it now lies north of the main road, the A91. Though a railway embankment was constructed through the middle of the village in the 19th century, it retains much of its original character, and has a number of traditional 17th-18th century houses. In recent years some of the older houses have been re-roofed in traditional thatch. Collessie in fact probably now has more thatched houses than any other village in the county of Fife. The civil parish had a population of 1,921 in 2011.Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC ‚Äì Usually Resident Population, publ. by National Records of Scotland.

See ‚ÄúStandard Outputs‚Äù, Table KS101SC, Area type: Civil Parish 1930 The Church Collessie church, Fife The church was consecrated by the Bishop of St. Andrews in July 1243. It is mentioned in charters of both 1252 and 1262, and so was complete by those dates. Prior to the Reformation, the church was in the ownership of the Abbot of Lindores and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1742 and 1743 the Rev Hugh Blair was the minister of Collessie. The church was remodelled in 1838‚Äì39 by R & R DicksonDictionary of Scottish Architects: Dickson to a T-plan form with a pinnacled western tower, and has remained virtually unchanged since that date.Guide to Collessie Church The minister at this point was the Rev John MacFarlane (1798-1875) who served from 1833 but left in the Disruption of 1843.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church The pulpit is in a central position at the head of the T, as in several Scottish churches such as Currie on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The pews date from 1911 when they were adjusted to a less upright stance to improve comfort. The font dates from 1928. The Collessie war memorial is in the east transept. The communion table was brought from Cowlairs Church and was their war memorial. The Churchyard Thatched houses in Collessie, Fife Countryside south of Collessie The tomb of Sir James Melville, Collessie, Fife The churchyard has been used since at least the 12th century. It was extended both in 1840 and 1871. It was taken over by the local County Council in 1929. The Melville Tomb Perhaps the most striking single feature of the kirkyard is ‚Äòthe Melville Tomb‚Äô. The mausoleum of the local lairdly family of Melville of Halhill, the tomb was restored from an extremely ruinous condition in 2004. It was erected in 1609 to house the remains of Christian Boswell, the wife of the courtier, diplomat and memoirist Sir James Melville (1536‚Äì1617) of Halhill. She was a Boswell of Balmuto, an estate north of Burntisland. Balmuto Castle, much altered, is still inhabited; in 1722, it passed from the line of Boswell of Balmuto into the possession of their kinsfolk the Boswells of Auchinleck, the family of Samuel Johnson‚Äôs biographer James Boswell (1740‚Äì95). Sir James Melville and Christian Boswell had four children; by far the most famous is the poet Elizabeth Melville, Lady Culross, who named one of her own daughters Christian. Presumably, the mausoleum received Sir James‚Äôs body in 1617, and is now somewhat inaccurately described on the information board next to it simply as ‚Äòthe tomb of Sir James Melville of Halhill‚Äô. After the burials of 1609 and 1617, the Collessie mausoleum may have been used for further members of the family, but there are no extant records to prove this. The tomb‚Äôs builder was succeeded as laird of Halhill by his eldest son, also called James. On the death of the latter's son (another James) in 1664, Halhill was adjudicated to a relative, George, Lord Melville, in payment of a debt. The tower-house at Halhill was pulled down in the eighteenth century and its exact location is now unknown. The Collessie mausoleum gradually fell prey to neglect and became a ruin: the carved heraldic shields that once filled niches on the walls have entirely vanished, as has the date '1609', recorded as late as 1895. However, before restoration, the Melville Tomb was already well known in the annals of 'funerary' literature, because it bears two seven-line stanzas of Scots- language verse.See, for example, Andrew Spicer, ‚Äò\\"Defile not Christs Kirk with your carrion\\": The development of burial aisles in post-Reformation Scotland‚Äô, in P.Marshall and B.Gordon, eds., The Place of the Dead in European Society, 1400‚Äì1700 (Cambridge, 2000), pp.149-69. Spicer assigns the date of Christian Boswell‚Äôs death to her husband, a mistake which has given rise to published statements that Sir James died in 1609, e.g., in Sarah Tarlow, Ritual, Belief and the Dead in Early Modern Britain and Ireland (2010) and in The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Death and Burial (2013). These are inscribed on the outer wall, which forms part of the kirkyard boundary, and overlooks what was formerly the principal highway to St Andrews. The poem, carved in large capitals, was thus intended to be read by travellers; like the vanished heraldry, it will have been painted, and thus easily legible. Now damaged, it was transcribed and published complete in 1895. Poems in the vernacular or in Latin are an extremely common feature of tombs, but they generally celebrate the deceased. The Collessie poem is quite different; its two seven-line stanzas make no mention of Christian Boswell or her husband, but constitute a short sermon about sin, redemption, death, burial and resurrection. The second stanza sternly denounces the widespread practice of burying bodies inside churches, and its striking first line has twice been used in the titles of articles on burial practices.See note 9 above, and also ‚Äò\\"Defyle not Chrysts Kirk with your Carrion\\": William Durandus (c.1230-96), a medieval view of burial‚Äô, in Monuments and Monumentality across Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Proceedings of the 2011 Stirling Conference, ed. Michael Penman (Donnington: Shaun Tyas, 2013), 212-223. Both these articles discuss The Blame of Kirk-Buriall, Tending to Perswade Cemeteriall Civilitie, by Mr William Birnie, Minister of Lanark (Edinburgh, 1606), edited W.B.D.D. Turnbull (London, 1833). :Ye loadin pilgrims passing langs this way :Pans on your fall, and your offencis past, ponder :How your frail flesh first formit of the clay :In dust mon be desolvit at the last: :Repent, amend, on Christ the burden cast :Of your sad sinnes, quha can your sauls refresh :Syne rais from grave to gloir your grislie flesh. :Defyle not Chrysts kirk with your carrion, :A soleme sait for Gods service prepard, :For praier, preaching and communion: :Your burial suld be in the kirkyaird. :On your uprysing set your great regard, :Quhen saull and body ioynes, with joy to ring reign :In heaven for ay with Christ our head and king. The poem, which uses ‚Äòrhyme royal‚Äô (known in Scotland as ‚ÄòTroylus verse‚Äô), has been attributed to Christian Boswell‚Äôs poet- daughter Elizabeth Melville on biographical and stylistic grounds.See Jamie Reid-Baxter, Poems of Elizabeth Melville (2010), pp.125-26. The original literary inspiration may have come from an inscription on the wall of Aberdour Kirk on the Fife coast, quite close to Balmuto Castle and to another Melville family seat, Rossend Castle in Burntisland (home of Elizabeth Melville's uncle Sir Robert of Murdocairnie, and then his son, Sir Robert of Burntisland): :Pans O pilgrim ponder :That passith by this way :Upon thine end :And thou sal fear to sin :And think also :Upon the latter day :When thou to God man count must give account :Then best thou now begin then Which laid out as pentameter verse (with a hypermetric last line) would read: :Pans O pilgrim that passith by this way :Upon thine end, and thou sal fear to sin: :And think also upon the latter day, :When thou to God man count: then best thou now begin. It has been suggested that ‚Äòpilgrim‚Äô alludes to the mediaeval pilgrimages to a well- known, now vanished healing well located near the church.See the notes at the end of: However, ‚Äòwhen‚Äô (rather than Scots ‚Äòquhen‚Äô) is suspicious in a supposedly pre-Reformation inscription. The word ‚Äòpilgrim‚Äô for all human beings on their earthly journey was a standard metaphor much used by Protestants, as the Collessie mausoleum inscription indicates. Elizabeth Melville repeatedly employs the term in her poetry.E.g. in Ane Godlie Dreame (1603), Melville calls on God to ‚ÄòMak haist to end our painefull pilgrimage‚Äô (line 32) ; she also describes herself as ‚ÄòAne pilgrime puir consumit with siching sair‚Äô (line 108) and the reader as ‚ÄòAne pilgrime puir into thy loathsum lyfe‚Äô (line 398). See Jamie Reid Baxter, Poems of Elizabeth Melville (Solsequium : Edinburgh, 2010), pp. 73, 76, 88. It is possible that the Melville tomb inscription provided the inspiration for the Aberdour inscription. If the Aberdour inscription predates 1609 and the Collessie tomb, Elizabeth Melville could have known of it from the man who in 1603 became master of Culross grammar school - her fellow-presbyterian John Fairfoul, former minister of Aberdour, who had become minister of Dunfermline in 1598.Hew Scott, Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae , v, p.27. Alternatively, Sir James Melville himself may have told his daughter about the Aberdour inscription (he is likely have had considerable input into the content of the poem on his wife‚Äôs mausoleum). Aberdour is quite close both to Balmuto Castle where Christian Boswell was born, and to another Melville family seat, Rossend Castle in Burntisland, home of Sir James‚Äôs elder brother Sir Robert of Murdocairnie, 1st Lord Melville, and then of his son, Sir Robert of Burntisland, 2nd Lord Melville.Rossend Castle Furthermore, Aberdour Kirk stands right next to Aberdour Castle, one of the seats of the Douglas earls of Morton. It was therefore a residence of two important Scottish peers well known to Sir James Melville, namely the Regent Morton (died 1581) and the militantly presbyterian Archibald Douglas, eighth Earl of Angus and fifth of Morton.Memoirs of His Own Life by Sir James Melville (Bannatyne Club : Edinburgh, 1827) pp.247-61 ; 300, 325. Archibald died in 1588; thereafter Aberdour Castle was the home of Archibald‚Äôs widow, Jean Lyon, and her third husband, Alexander Lindsay, First Lord Spynie.Memoirs of His Own Life by Sir James Melville (Bannatyne Club : Edinburgh, 1827) p. 402 Other notable interments *Sir William Oliphant Hutchison (1889‚Äì1970) artist, President of the Royal Scottish Academy *John Cheape of Rossie, father of Sir John Cheape The school The school and schoolmaster's house date from 1846 (prior to the Education Act of 1875) providing free education from an early date.

Additional localised disruption continued into May 2010. The eruption was declared officially over in October 2010, when snow on the glacier did not melt. From 14‚Äì20 April, ash from the volcanic eruption covered large areas of Northern Europe. About 20 countries closed their airspace to commercial jet traffic and it affected approximately 10 million travellers. Seismic activity started at the end of 2009 and gradually increased in intensity until on 20 March 2010, a small eruption began, rated as a 1 on the volcanic explosivity index. Beginning on 14 April 2010, the eruption entered a second phase and created an ash cloud that led to the closure of most of the European IFR airspace from 15 until 20 April 2010. Consequently, a very high proportion of flights within, to, and from Europe were cancelled, creating the highest level of air travel disruption since the Second World War. The second phase resulted in an estimated (0.25 km3) of ejected tephra and an ash plume that rose to a height around , which rates the explosive power of the eruption as a 4 on the volcanic explosivity index.Erica R. Hendry \\"What We Know From the Icelandic Volcano,\\" Smithsonian, 22 April 2010. Retrieved April 2010. By 21 May 2010, the second eruption phase had subsided to the point that no further lava or ash was being produced. By the evening of 6 June 2010, a small, new crater had opened up on the west side of the main crater. Explosive activity from this new crater was observed with emission of small quantities of ash. Seismic data showed that the frequency and intensity of earth tremors still exceeded the levels observed before the eruption, therefore scientists at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) and the Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland (IES) continued to monitor the volcano. In October 2010, √Årmann H√∂skuldsson, a scientist at the University of Iceland Institute of Earth Sciences, stated that the eruption was officially over, although the area was still geothermally active and might erupt again. Background Dust particles that get suspended in the atmosphere scatter light from the setting sun, generating 'volcanic lavenders' like this one over the flight path of Leeds- Bradford Airport in England during the aviation shutdown Eyjafjallaj√∂kull () is one of Iceland's smaller ice caps located in the far south of the island. Situated to the north of Sk√≥gar and to the west of the larger ice cap M√Ωrdalsj√∂kull, Eyjafjallaj√∂kull covers the caldera of a volcano high, which has erupted relatively frequently since the last ice age. The most recent major eruptions occurred in 920, 1612, and from 1821 to 1823. Previous eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull have been followed by eruptions at its larger neighbour, Katla. On 20 April 2010 Icelandic President √ìlafur Gr√≠msson said, \\"the time for Katla to erupt is coming close ... we [Iceland] have prepared ... it is high time for European governments and airline authorities all over the world to start planning for the eventual Katla eruption.\\" The volcanic events starting in March 2010 were considered to be a single eruption divided into phases. The first eruption phase ejected olivine basaltic andesite lava several hundred metres into the air in what is known as an effusive eruption. Ash ejection from this phase of the eruption was small, rising to no more than into the atmosphere. On 14 April 2010, however, the eruption entered an explosive phase and ejected fine glass-rich ash to over into the atmosphere. The second phase was estimated to be a VEI 4 eruption, which was large, but not nearly the most powerful eruption possible by volcanic standards. By way of comparison, the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 was rated as 5 on the VEI, and the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was rated as a 6. This second phase erupted trachyandesite. This volcanic activity so disruptive to air travel because of a combination of factors: # The volcano was directly under the jet stream. # The direction of the jet stream was unusually stable at the time of the eruption's second phase, continuously southeast. # The second eruptive phase happened under of glacial ice. The resulting meltwater flowed back into the erupting volcano, which created two specific phenomena: ## The rapidly vaporising water significantly increased the eruption's explosive power. ## The erupting lava cooled very fast, which created a cloud of highly abrasive, glass-rich ash. # The volcano's explosive power was enough to inject ash directly into the jet stream. Public observations People observing the first fissure at Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls \\"Volcano tourism\\" quickly sprang up in the wake of the eruption, with local tour companies offering day trips to see the volcano. The Civil Protection Department of the Icelandic Police produced regular reports about access to the area, including a map of the restricted area around Eyjafjallajokull, from which the public was forbidden. Teams from the Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue were stationed at the eruption site as part of standard safety measures and to assist in enforcing access restrictions. Vodafone and the Icelandic telecommunications company M√≠la installed webcams, giving views of the eruption from Valahn√∫kur, Hvolsv√∂llur, and √û√≥r√≥lfsfell. The view of the eruption from √û√≥r√≥lfsfel also includes a thermal imaging camera. Scientific observations The London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC), part of the UK Met Office, was responsible for forecasting the presence of volcanic ash in the north-east Atlantic. All ash dispersion models for this geographic region were produced by the VAAC in London. A study by the Icelandic Meteorological Office published on December 2009 indicated an increase in seismic activity around the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull area during the years 2006‚Äì2009. The study reported increased activity that occurred between June and August 2009 (200 events), compared to a total of about 250 earthquakes recorded between September 2006 and August 2009. It further indicated that the locations of most of the earthquakes in 2009 occurred between depth east of the volcano's top crater. At the end of December 2009, seismic activity began around the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano area, with thousands of small earthquakes (mostly of magnitude 1‚Äì2 Mw), beneath the volcano.Ve√∞urstofa √çslands (5 March 2010) The radar stations of the Meteorological Institute of Iceland did not detect any appreciable amount of volcanic ashfall during the first 24 hours of the eruption. However, during the night of 22 March, they reported some volcanic ash fall reaching the Flj√≥tshl√≠√∞ area ( north-west of the eruption's location) and Hvolsv√∂llur town ( north-west of the eruption location) leaving vehicles with a fine, grey layer of volcanic ash. At around 07:00 on 22 March, an explosion launched eruption columns as far as straight up into the air. This was the highest plume since the eruption started. On 23 March, a small vapour explosion took place, when hot magma came into contact with nearby snowdrifts, emitting a vapour plume which reached an altitude of , and was detected on radar from the Meteorological Institute of Iceland. After that, many further vapour explosions occurred.R√≠kis√∫tvarpi√∞ fr√©ttavefur By 26 February 2010, the global positioning system (GPS) equipment used by the Iceland Meteorological Office at √ûorvaldseyri farm in the Eyjafj√∂ll area (around south-east of the location of the recent eruption)Measurements made by using maps and measurement tools from Fasteignaskr√° √çslandskort had shown 3 cm of displacement of the local crust in a southward direction, of which a 1-cm displacement had taken place within four days. (See the GPS Time Series page of the Nordic Volcanological Center's website for detailed information on the degree of movement detected in the Earth's crust in the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull locality.) This unusual seismic activity, along with the rapid movement of the Earth's crust in the area, gave geophysicists evidence that magma was flowing from underneath the crust into Eyjafjallaj√∂kull's magma chamber and that pressure stemming from the process caused (in geophysical terms) the huge crustal displacement at √ûorvaldseyri farm.Morgubla√∞i√∞ (26 February 2010) The seismic activity continued to increase, and from 3 to 5 March, close to 3,000 earthquakes were measured having their epicentre at the volcano. Most of these were too small (magnitude 2) to be interpreted as precursors to an eruption, but some could be detected in nearby towns. The grounding of European flights avoided about 3.44 kg of CO2 emissions per day, while the volcano emitted about 1.5 kg of CO2 per day.UNEP Year Book2011, An Overview of Our Changing Environment, United Nations Environment Programme 2011 page 2.

Shortly afterward, the water level returned to normal and water temperature decreased.Meteorological Institute of Iceland: Eruption in Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls mountain pass This rise in water temperature was thought to be related to the eruption nearby and was affecting part of the Kross√° drainage basin.

Mars Fissure Second fissure, viewed from the north, on 2 April 2010 The first phase of the 2010 eruption began late on the evening of 20 March at the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull. The initial visual report of the eruption was at 23:52 GMT, when a red cloud was seen at the north slopes of Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls mountain pass, lighting up the sky above the eruptive site. The eruption was preceded by intense seismicity and high rates of deformation in the weeks before the eruption, in association with magma recharging of the volcano. Immediately before the eruption, the depth of the seismicity had become shallow, but was not significantly enhanced from what it had been in the previous weeks. Deformation was occurring at rates up to a centimetre a day since 4 March at various GPS sites installed within from the eruptive site. A fissure opened up about in length running in a north-east to south- west direction, with 10 to 12 erupting lava craters ejecting lava at a temperature around up to into the air. The lava was alkali olivine basalt and was relatively viscous, causing the motion of the lava stream to the west and east of the fissure to be slow. The molten lava flowed more than to the north- east of the fissure and into Hrunagil canyon, forming a lava fall more than long and slowly approaching √û√≥rsm√∂rk, but had not reached the flood plains of Kross√°.Morgunbla√∞i√∞ 22.

This indicates that the rate at which magma was flowing into the magma chamber roughly equaled the rate at which it was being lost due to the eruption, giving evidence that this phase of volcanic activity reached equilibrium.Ve√∞urstofa √çslands (24 March 2010) A new fissure opened on 31 March, around north-west of the original fissure. Many witnesses were present while the new fissure opened. It was a bit smaller, around long according to witnesses, and lava coming from it started to flow into Hvann√°rgil canyon. These two erupting fissures shared the same magma chamber, according to geophysicists. No unusual seismic activity was detected at the time the new fissure appeared, nor any crustal expansion according to many seismometers and GPS recorders situated in nearby areas.Ve√∞urstofa √çslands Morgunbla√∞i√∞ 1. April Geophysicist Magn√∫s Tumi Einarsson said (at a press meeting in Hvolsv√∂llur on 21 March) that this eruption was small compared to, for example, the eruption of Hekla in 2000. The eruption, rather than taking place under the ice cap of the glacier, occurred in the mountain pass between the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull and M√Ωrdalsj√∂kull glaciers. As long as the fissure was not near the glacier, the risk of flooding was minimal; however, the fissure could extend into the ice cap, thereby greatly increasing the risk of flooding. Phase 2: Explosive eruption Aqua showing the ash plume over North Atlantic at 13:30 GMT on 15 April The estimated ash cloud at 18:00 GMT on 15 April. After a short hiatus in eruptive activity, and a large increase in seismic activity 23:00 on 13 April and 1:00 on 14 April, a new set of craters opened early in the morning of 14 April 2010 under the volcano's ice-covered central summit caldera. The earthquake swarm was followed by the onset of a seismic eruption tremor. Meltwater started to emanate from the ice cap around 07:00 on 14 April and an eruption plume was observed in the early morning. Visual observations were greatly restricted due to cloud cover over the volcano, but an aeroplane of the Icelandic Coast Guard imaged eruptive craters with radar instruments. A series of vents along a 2-km-long north‚Äìsouth-oriented fissure was active, with meltwater flowing mostly down the northern slopes of the volcano, but also to the south. An ash-loaded eruption plume rose to more than , deflected to the east by westerly winds. Ash analysis Upper: Ash covers the Th√≥rsm√∂rk valley in early June 2010, immediately after the eruption Lower: The same area, in September 2011 Samples of volcanic ash collected near the eruption showed a silica concentration of 58%‚Äîmuch higher than in the lava flows.name=\\"earthice1\\" The concentration of water-soluble fluoride was one- third of the concentration typical in Hekla eruptions, with a mean value of 104 mg of fluoride per kg of ash. Agriculture is important in this region of Iceland,A report in Icelandic: Landb√∫na√∞ur skiptir m√°li (transl. \\"Agriculture matters\\") says that 28% of the total workforce in agriculture are scattered throughout southern Iceland. and farmers near the volcano have been warned not to let their livestock drink from contaminated streams and water sources,Morgunbla√∞i√∞ 23. March 2010 as high concentrations of fluoride can have deadly renal and hepatic effects, particularly in sheep. Impact on farming The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority released an announcement on 18 April 2010, asking that all horse owners who keep their herds outside be on the alert for ash fall. Where ash fall was significant, all horses had to be sheltered indoors. The thick layer of ash that had fallen on some Icelandic pastures and farms at Raufarfell had become wet and compact, making it very difficult to continue farming, harvesting, or grazing livestock. Timeline of the second eruption phase Unlike the earlier eruption phase, the second phase occurred beneath glacial ice. Cold water from melted ice quickly chilled the lava, causing it to fragment into highly abrasive glass particles that were then carried into the eruption plume. This, together with the magnitude of the eruption (estimated to be VEI 4) and being 10 to 20 times larger than the eruption of Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls on 20 March, injected a glass-rich ash plume into the jet stream. In addition to volcanic ash being very hazardous to aircraft, the location of this eruption directly under the jet stream ensured that the ash was carried into the heavily used airspace over northern and central Europe. Phase 3: Return to dormancy A necklace made from the ash of the 2010 eruption: Jewellery and similar memorabilia of the eruption are now sold in Iceland. By the morning of 24 May 2010, the view from the web camera installed on √û√≥r√≥lfsfell showed only a plume of water vapour surrounded by a bluish haze caused by emission of sulphurous gases. Due to the large quantities of dry volcanic ash lying on the ground, surface winds frequently lifted up an \\"ash mist\\" that significantly reduced visibility and made web camera observation of the volcano impossible. On 21 June 2010, data from seismic recorders in the area indicated that the frequency and strength of earth tremors had diminished, but were continuing. In October 2010, √Årmann H√∂skuldsson, a scientist at the University of Iceland Institute of Earth Sciences, stated that the eruption was officially over, although the area was still geothermally active and might erupt again. During the eruption, the BBC television news announcers did not try to pronounce the name \\"Eyjafjallaj√∂kull,\\" but called it \\"the Iceland volcano.\\" Volume of erupted material and magma discharge The Institute of Earth Sciences made a preliminary estimate of erupted material in the first three days of the eruption on 14 April 2010 at Eyjafjallaj√∂kull. The erupted products were fragmented material, the majority fine-grained airborne tephra. Eruptive products can be split into three categories along with preliminary estimated erupted volumes: # Material (tephra) in the ice cauldrons around the volcanic vents: # Tephra filling the glacial lagoon of G√≠gj√∂kulsl√≥n, carried by floods down the outlet glacier G√≠gj√∂kull: # Airborne tephra that was carried to the east and south of the volcano, uncompacted tephra fallout from eruption plume: Total: which corresponds to some of magma. The magma discharge rate was about or 750 t/s. This was 10‚Äì20 times the average discharge rate in the preceding flank eruption at Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls. (First eruption on 20 March 2010). The IES updated the eruption flow rate on 21 April 2010 to an estimation less than of magma, or 75 tonnes/s, with a large uncertainty. IES also noted that the eruption continue with less explosive activity. Health effects No human fatalities were reported from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull. The people who lived near the volcano had high levels of irritation symptoms, though their lung function was not lower than expected. Six months later, the population living in the area had more respiratory symptoms than a control group from North Iceland, with no ashfall. In Scotland, the number of phone calls to health services for respiratory and eye irritation did not rise significantly. Effects of the ash plume on air travel Volcanic ash is a major hazard to aircraft.C. M. Riley, \\"Tephra\\" Michigan Technological University Geological & Mining, Engineering & Sciences, Retrieved on 23 January 2008. Smoke and ash from eruptions reduce visibility for visual navigation, and microscopic debris in the ash can sandblast windscreens and melt in the heat of aircraft turbine engines, damaging engines and making them shut down. Many flights within, to, and from Europe were cancelled following 14 April 2010 eruption, and although no commercial aircraft were damaged, the engines of some military aircraft were harmed. The presence and location of the plume depends upon the state of the eruption and the winds. While some ash fell on uninhabited areas in Iceland, most had been carried by westerly winds resulting in the shutdown of large air space over Europe. The shutdown had a knock on impact on the economy and cultural events across Europe. The Icelandic flag carrier airline, Icelandair, seemed at first especially vulnerable, but managed to deal effectively with the eruption and subsequently published a detailed report about its actions and conclusions. Short- and long-term weather and environmental effects Possible ash fallout from Eyjafjallaj√∂kull on a car, Manchester, England, 21 April 2010 At the mouth of the crater, the gases, ejecta, and volcanic plume have created a rare weather phenomenon known as volcanic lightning (or a \\"dirty thunderstorm\\"). When rocks and other ejecta collide with one another, they create static electricity. This, with the abundant water-ice at the summit, aids in making lightning. High-fluoride Hekla eruptions pose a threat to foraging livestock, especially sheep. Fluoride poisoning can start in sheep at a diet with fluorine content of 25 ppm. At 250 ppm, death can occur within a few days. In 1783, 79% of the Icelandic sheep stock were killed, probably as a result of fluorosis caused by the eruption of Laki.Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 39‚Äì58 The effect also spread beyond Iceland.Tom de Castella (16 April 2010) \\"The eruption that changed Iceland forever,\\" BBC News. Retrieved 18 April 2010. Ash from the current Eyjafjallaj√∂kull eruption contains one-third the concentration typical in Hekla eruptions, with a mean value of 104 mg of fluoride per kg of ash. Large-scale release of sulphur dioxide into the troposphere also poses a potential health risk, especially to people with pre- existing breathing disorders. As of 15 April, the eruption was not large enough to have an effect on global temperatures like that of Mount Pinatubo and other major past volcanic eruptions.Sara Phillips \\"Icelandic volcano won't affect the world's climate\\" ABC, 16 April 2010. One previous related sequence of eruptions of this volcano, beginning in 1821 is recorded as having lasted for over two years, but no single set of major eruptions is known to have lasted more than 'several days'. Comparison to other recent eruptions The recent eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull and the largest ash plume associated with the second eruption phase were not unparalleled in either volume or abundance; however, the location was the critical factor because it affected air travel across Europe. Neither phase of the eruption was unusually powerful. Other notable volcanic eruptions in recent years include the eruption of Mount Pinatubo of 1991 of VEI 6. This eruption lasted eight days, from 7 ‚Äì 15 June of that year, with an ash cloud that would have required additional days to dissipate, and resulted in worldwide abnormal weather and decrease in global temperature over the next few years. However, the second phase of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull's eruption lasted longer than that of Mount Pinatubo.

The Indonesian word bersiap means 'get ready' or 'be prepared'. The Bersiap period lasted from August 1945 to December 1946. The period started with revolutionary violence occurring during the increasing power vacuum left by the retreating Japanese occupational forces and the gradual buildup of a British military presence but before the official handover to a Dutch military presence. The term refers to that period when, Sukarno declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945. Thousands of Eurasian people were kiled by Indonesian natives.https://www.libris.nl/boek/?authortitle=herman- bussemaker/bersiap-opstand-in-het-paradijs-9789057309014/ Many people were also killed among non-European groups such as Chinese and Moluccans. The violence led to forced repatriation and worldwide diaspora of the Indo people. The period ended with the departure of the British military in 1946, by which time the Dutch had rebuilt their military capacity. Meanwhile, the Indonesian revolutionary fighters were well into the process of forming a formal military. The last Japanese troops had been evacuated by July 1946. Term This particular phase of the Indonesian revolution is termed Bersiap by Dutch Indo (Eurasian) survivors of the period and is used in academic works in Dutch and English. The term is derived from the Indonesian battle cry and perpetual call to arms: \\"Siap!\\" ‚Äì \\"Get Ready!\\" heard when potential enemies of the revolution were entering pro-republican areas.Bayly, Christopher Harper, Tim Forgotten Wars, Freedom and revolution in Southeast Asia (Publisher: Harvard University Press, 2006) P.181 Googlebooks Today the term Bersiap killings is also used to avoid confusion.https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/12/the-untold-story- surabaya-battle-1945.html https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623528.2012.719370?src=recsys&journalCode;=cjgr20 Indonesian independence declared On 15 August 1945, the Japanese surrendered to the Allies. As there was, for the most part, no Allied re- conquest of the western part of the Dutch East Indies (The eastern islands were already occupied by the Allies), the Japanese were still in charge on Java and Sumatra and had received specific orders to maintain the status quo until Allied forces arrived on these islands. Sukarno, Hatta, and the older leadership were hesitant to act and did not want to provoke conflict with the Japanese.Ricklefs (1991), p. 210 Vice Admiral Maeda Tadashi, fearing volatile youth groups, and the demoralised Japanese troops, wanted a quick transfer of power to the older generation of Indonesian leaders. While the older nationalist leadership group, including Sukarno and Hatta, were reluctant, younger members of the new elite, the 'youth' (Indonesian: pemuda), believed they had a duty to push for revolution. A group associated with Menteng 31 kidnapped both Sukarno and Hatta and forced them to agree to declaring Indonesian independence. On 17 August 1945, two days after the surrender, Sukarno and Hatta declared independence at Sukarno's house in Jakarta.Ricklefs (1991), page 213; ; Reid (1973), page 30; Vickers (2005), p. 95 Indonesian staff briefly seized Jakarta radio from their Japanese supervisors and broadcast the news of the declaration across Java.Taylor (2003), p. 323 The start of the revolution It was mid-September before news of the declaration of independence spread across the island Java, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country.Ricklefs (1991), pages 214 ‚Äì 215 External power had shifted; it would be weeks before the Allied Forces entered the island of Java, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.Friend (2003), page 32; Robert Cribb, 'A revolution delayed: the Indonesian Republic and the Netherlands Indies, August‚ÄìNovember 1945', Australian Journal of Politics and History 32 no. 1 (1986), pp. 72‚Äì85. At the time of the surrender, there were 70,000 Japanese troops in Java and Sukarno and Hatta were concerned that celebratory independence rallies would result in the guns of Japanese troops being turned on Indonesian crowds.Taylor (2003), p. 324 While the older leadership set about constructing a government on paper, they could do little to kerb younger mobs who attacked sultans and other members of the Indonesian elite, retaliated violently against those village heads who had assisted Japanese oppression of Indonesian peasants, attacked other alleged \\"traitors\\", and fought for turf and weapons.Taylor (2003), p. 324, 326 The resulting power vacuums in the weeks following the Japanese surrender created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans.Friend (2003), page 32 Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations. However, as Republican youths fought to secure the cities and take arms, attacks on the Japanese did occur, usually following Allied orders for the Japanese to disarm Indonesian troops. Many of the Indonesian militia and some Japanese troops had no intention of allowing Indonesian disarmament, and in places like Bandung open conflict broke out.Vickers (2005), p. 97 By September 1945, control of major infrastructure installations, including railway stations and trams in Java's largest cities, had been taken over by Republican pemuda.Ricklefs (1991), pages 215 ‚Äì 216 To spread the revolutionary message, pemuda set up their own radio stations and newspapers, and graffiti proclaimed the nationalist sentiment. On most islands, struggle committees and militia were set up.Vickers (2005), page 97 Republican newspapers and journals were common in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta. They fostered a generation of writers known as angkatan 45 ('generation of 45') many of whom believed their work could be part of the revolution. In southern Kalimantan, Australian Communist soldiers spread the word of the Indonesian independence declaration.VIckers (2005), p. 97 Republican leaders struggled to come to terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian pemuda. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.Vickers (2005), p. 97; Ricklefs (1991). By September 1945, many of the self-proclaimed pemuda, who were ready to die for '100% freedom', were becoming impatient.Vickers (2005), p. 98 It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' ‚Äî Dutch internees, Eurasians, Ambonese and Chinese ‚Äî and anyone considered to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnap, robbery, and sometimes murder, even organised massacres. Such attacks would continue to some extent for the course of the revolution.Reid (1974), page 49; Mochtar Lubis, Jalan Tak Ada (Jakarta: Yayasan Obot Indonesia, 2002) [originally published 1952], p.78; Anthony Reid, Indonesian National Revolution (Hawthorn, Vic.: Longman, 1974), chs. 2 and 3; Shirley Fenton-Huie, The Forgotten Ones: Women and Children Under Nippon (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1992); Anthony Reid, 'Indonesia: revolution without socialism', in Robin Jeffrey (ed.), Asia: the Winning of Independence (London: Macmillan Publishers, 1981), pp. 107‚Äì57. As the level of violence increased across the country, the Sukarno- and Hatta-led Republican government in Jakarta urged calm. However, pemuda, in favour of armed struggle, saw the older leadership as dithering and betraying the revolution, which often led to conflict amongst Indonesians. Formation of the Republican government By the end of August, a central Republican government had been established in Jakarta. It adopted a constitution drafted during the Japanese occupation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence.Ricklefs (1991), p. 213 Following Japanese navy advice that Christian Indonesians in its area would disapprove, provisions for a special role for Islam, such as the Jakarta Charter and a mandatory Muslim head of state, were not enacted. With general elections yet to be held, a Central Indonesian National Committee (KINP) was appointed to assist the president, however, elections were not held for 10 years. Similar committees were established at provincial and regency levels. Indonesian administrative advisors (sanyo), who had been appointed by the Japanese, and vice regents were appointed as Republican officials. This allowed for an efficient and discreet handover of power from the Japanese that minimised violation of the terms of the Japanese surrender. Questions of allegiance immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. Central Javanese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many raja ('rulers') of the outer islands, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from South Sulawesi (including the king of Bone, who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in the century), and from Makassarese and Bugis raja, who supported the Republican Governor of Jakarta, a Menadonese Christian. Many Balinese raja accepted Republican authority.Ricklefs (1991), page 214 Fearing the Dutch would attempt to re- establish their authority over Java and Sumatra, the new De facto Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in parts of Java. It was rarely and loosely in contact with the outer islands,Friend (2003), page 33 which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists.Ricklefs (1991), page 215 In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed prime minister. Also were many islands already occupied by Allied troops, especially British, Australian and Dutch troops. In the week following the Japanese surrender, the Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese.Most PETA and Heiho members did not yet know about the declaration of independence. Command structures and membership vital for a national army were consequently dismantled. Thus, rather than being formed from a trained, armed, and organised army, the Republican armed forces began to grow in September from usually younger, less trained groups built around charismatic leaders. Creating a rational military structure that was obedient to central authority from such disorganisation, was one of the major problems of the revolution, a problem that remains through to contemporary times.Friend (2003), page 35 In the self-created Indonesian army, Japanese-trained Indonesian officers prevailed over those trained by the Dutch. A thirty-year-old former school teacher, Sudirman, was elected 'commander-in-chief' at the first meeting of Division Commanders in Yogyakarta on 12 November 1945.Reid (1974), page 78 The Dutch accused Sukarno and Hatta of collaborating with the Japanese, and denounced the Republic as a creation of Japanese fascism. The Dutch East Indies administration had just received a ten million dollar loan from the United States to finance its return to the Dutch East Indies. Allied occupation A soldier of an Indian armoured regiment examines a light tank used by Indonesian nationalists and captured by British forces during the fighting in Surabaya. The Netherlands, however, was critically weakened from World War II in Europe and did not return as a significant military force until early 1946. The Japanese and members of the Allied forces reluctantly agreed to act as caretakers. As US forces were focusing on the Japanese home islands, the archipelago was put under the jurisdiction of British Admiral Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command. Allied enclaves already existed in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), Morotai (Maluku) and parts of Irian Jaya; Dutch administrators had already returned to these areas. In the Japanese navy areas, the arrival of Allied troops quickly prevented revolutionary activities where Australian troops, followed by Dutch troops and administrators, took the Japanese surrender (except for Bali and Lombok).Ricklefs (1991), page 216 Due to the lack of strong resistance, two Australian Army divisions succeeded in occupying eastern Indonesia.Ashton and Hellema (2001), page 181 The British- led South East Asia Command was charged with restoring order and civilian government in Java. The Dutch took this to mean pre-war colonial administration and continued to claim sovereignty over Indonesia. Because the Dutch London-based government-in-exile were allied to the British, they expected the return of their colony, and the Japanese and members of the Allied Forces reluctantly fulfilled this promise. Before August 24 the Van Mook-MacArthur Civil Affairs Agreement was still in effect. The key provision of this agreement was that areas recaptured by Allied troops would revert to Dutch rule via the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). After the Anglo‚ÄìDutch Civil Affairs Agreement was formally signed the agreement was taken over by the British. On 2 September, it was decided the agreement would apply to all areas of the Dutch East Indies occupied by British forces.http://www.endofempire.asia/british-dutch-agreement-on-indonesia- formalized/ British Commonwealth troops did not, however, land on Java to accept the Japanese surrender until late September 1945. Lord Mountbatten's immediate tasks included the repatriation of some 300,000 Japanese, and freeing prisoners of war. He did not want, nor did he have the resources, to commit his troops to a long struggle to regain Indonesia for the Dutch. The first British troops reached Jakarta in late September 1945, and arrived in the cities of Medan (North Sumatra), Padang (West Sumatra), Palembang (South Sumatra), Semarang (Central Java) and Surabaya (East Java) in October. In an attempt to avoid clashes with Indonesians, the British commander Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison, diverted soldiers of the former Dutch colonial army to eastern Indonesia, where Dutch reoccupation was proceeding smoothly. Tensions mounted as Allied troops entered Java and Sumatra; clashes broke out between Republicans and their perceived enemies, namely Dutch prisoners, Dutch colonial troops (KNIL), Chinese, Eurasians and Japanese. Destruction in Bandung's Chinese quarter The first stages of warfare were initiated in October 1945 when, in accordance with the terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they relinquished to Indonesian nationalists in the towns and cities. Japanese military police killed Republican pemuda in Pekalongan (Central Java) on 3 October, and Japanese troops drove Republican pemuda out of Bandung in West Java and handed the city to the British, but the fiercest fighting involving the Japanese was in Semarang. On 14 October, British forces began to occupy the city. Retreating Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners they were holding. Five hundred Japanese and 2,000 Indonesians had been killed and the Japanese had almost captured the city six days later when British forces arrived. The Allies repatriated the remaining Japanese troops and civilians to Japan, although about 1,000 elected to remain behind and later assisted Republican forces in fighting for independence.Tjandraningsih, Christine T., \\"Indonesians to get book on Japanese freedom fighter \\", Japan Times, 19 August 2011, p. 3. The British subsequently decided to evacuate the 10,000 Indo-Europeans and European internees in the volatile Central Java interior. British detachments sent to the towns of Ambarawa and Magelang encountered strong Republican resistance and used air attacks against the Indonesians. Sukarno arranged a ceasefire on 2 November, but by late November fighting had resumed and the British withdrew to the coast.Ricklefs (1991), page 216; Republican attacks against Allied and alleged pro-Dutch civilians reached a peak in November and December, with 1,200 killed in Bandung as the pemuda returned to the offensive.Reid (1973), page 54 In March 1946, departing Republicans responded to a British ultimatum for them to leave the city of Bandung by deliberately burning down much of the southern half of the city in what is popularly known in Indonesia as the \\"Bandung Sea of Fire\\". The last British troops left Java in November 1946, but by this time 55,000 Dutch troops had already landed. Landing of NICA With British assistance, the Dutch landed their Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) forces in Jakarta and other key centres. Republican sources reported 8,000 deaths up to January 1946 in the defence of Jakarta, but they could not hold the city.Vickers (2005), page 99 The Republican leadership thus established themselves in the city of Yogyakarta with the crucial support of the new sultan, Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Yogyakarta went on to play a leading role in the revolution, which would result in the city being granted its own Special Territory status.Indonesia Law No. 5/1974 Concerning Basic Principles on Administration in the Region (translated version). The President of the Republic of Indonesia (1974). Chapter VII Transitional Provisions, Art. 91. In Bogor, near Jakarta, and in Balikpapan in Kalimantan, Republican officials were imprisoned. In preparation for the Dutch occupation of Sumatra, its largest cities, Palembang and Medan, were bombed. In December 1946, Special Forces Depot (DST), led by commando and counter-insurgency expert Captain Raymond 'Turk' Westerling, were accused of pacifying the southern Sulawesi region using arbitrary terror techniques, which were copied by other anti- Republicans. As many as 3,000 Republican militia and their supporters were killed in a few weeks.Ricklefs (1991), page 224 On Java and Sumatra, the Dutch found military success in cities and major towns, but they were unable to subdue the villages and countryside. On the outer islands (including Bali), Republican sentiment was not as strong, at least among the elite. They were consequently occupied by the Dutch with comparative ease, and autonomous states were set up by the Dutch. The largest, the State of East Indonesia (NIT), encompassed most of eastern Indonesia, and was established in December 1946, with its administrative capital in Makassar. Phases Pemuda on Java, armed with bamboo spears and Japanese rifles, 1946 Several phases are distinguished during the Bersiap period, each with different levels of violence and chaos. The Bersiap was mostly situated on the island of Java. British troops landed on Sumatra in October 1945. Former civilian internees on Sumatra were put into large camps in the sparsely populated interior. They were taken to the coast to the cities of Padang, Medan, and Palembang. By the end of November, all Japanese internment camps on Sumatra had been cleared. On Sumatra, the Japanese cooperated with the British and the Indonesian republicans were less militant than on Java, because the British never went inland and preferred to bypass areas with difficult terrain like Aceh and Batakland. The situation there, despite rioting in Medan and Padang, was relatively peaceful by the end of 1945. The chaotic Bersiap violence did not occur on any other island in Indonesia. Bamboo stick used to kill civilians during the Bersiap Bersiap started immediately after the proclamation of Indonesian independence and before the arrival of the first British and Dutch armed forces. Chinese houses and shops were looted and their families killed. Militias were formed all over the Indonesian island, in North Sulawesi, youth formed BPMI militia. By October, Republican leaders tried to organize these militias into a formal para-military called the TKR, however, this effort was slowed by the allies. On 18 September 1945 a group of ex-internees led by Mr. W.V.Ch. Ploegman raised a Dutch flag at the Yamato Hotel where they were staying. This action angered unarmed Surabaya youth. Several people died. On 23 September 1945, Dutch Captain P.J.G. Huijer who went into Surabaya with permission from Admiral Helfrich (Commander of Dutch forces in the Indies), and General Van Oyen (KNIL Commander), claimed they were ordered by Mountbatten to request that General Nagano (IJA 16th Army) surrender. They actually did not have permission from the British. The Japanese troops paraded on the airfield and laid down their weapons, including tanks, anti-aircraft weapons, artillery, transports and ammunition, then withdraw to Semarang. The newly-formed Indonesian TKR militia descend on the airfield and seized the arms. Huijer was captured by the TKR on 9 October and delivered to the British consulate. This incident was the beginning of many conflicts in the Surabaya area. In the second phase of the Bersiap (15 Sept ‚Äì 14 Oct 1945), de- centralised local Pemuda groups started to organise and obtain weapons. The first Japanese soldiers were molested and the attitude against Dutch and Eurasian civilians became hostile. Indonesian propaganda also became aggressive. Atrocities committed by revolutionary forces against Indo- Europeans began.Frederick, Willam H. Visions and Heat: The Making of the Indonesian Revolution (Publisher Ohio University Press, Athens, Ohio, 1989.) P. 237-243 Fights between Pemuda and young Eurasians broke out, resulting in a food boycott of Indos (October 5), which in turn resulted in more violent fights. In October, razzias (raids) commenced and Eurasian males were arrested and killed. On 12 October, the Revolutionary government ordered the arrest of all Eurasian men and boys. In Surabaya, 42 Eurasians were killed in the basement of the Simpang Club and several hundred were tortured in the Kalisosok Prison in the Werfstraat. After an Ambonese prison guard informed the British about plans to poison the prisoners (9 November), they were rescued (10 November) by a Eurasian commander and a Gurkha unit.Bussemaker, H.Th. Bersiap! - Opstand in het paradijs. (Walburg Pers, Zutphen, 2005) summarised in the educational paper: tongtong.nl By the end of September, the first British (Indian) troops started to arrive. The British tried to remain neutral and seek cooperation with the Republican leadership. Also, the Japanese military tried not to get involved and only reacted when provoked. The 49th Indian Infantry Brigade arrived in Surabaya by 25 October 1945 under Brigadier Mallaby. At first, the British were received well by TKR commander Mustopo and Surabaya Governor Dr Surio, and deployed in small units all over the city. TKR was instructed to support the British in securing Japanese prisoners and to save allied internees. On the morning of the 27th, an Allied airplane spread leaflets demanding that Indonesians surrender their weapons or be shot. This ultimatum from General Hawthorne, caused an uprising in Surabaya by dozens of youth militias that led to a battle on 10 November and a fatwa jihad (holy war) against westerners. By October 1945, a fatwa jihad supporting war in Surabaya was echoed in Aceh by popular cleric Daud Beurueh. Some militia contingents from Sulawesi and other Indonesian areas became involved in the Surabaya war. The third phase (middle of October to the end of November 1945) is considered the most violent one. In Surabaya and Malang, Indonesian forces were able to disarm the Japanese military. European and Indo-European men and boys were locked up, soon followed by women and girls. (The British military subsequently decided to evacuate the 10,000 Indo-Europeans and European internees from the volatile Central Java interior).Ricklefs (1991) Travel for the perceived anti-revolutionary population‚ÄîChristian Indonesian, Chinese Indonesian, European and Indo-European people‚Äîbecame impossible. The British armed forces tried to obtain control, but encountered heavy resistance, particularly in the middle of Java.British detachments sent to the towns of Ambarawa and Magelang encountered strong Republican resistance and used air strikes against the Indonesian forces. p. 216; See: McMillan, Richard. 'The British Occupation of Indonesia 1945-1946' (Publisher Routledge, Melbourne, 2005) pp. 306‚Äì307 Surabaya was the scene of bitter fighting.(see Battle of Surabaya) The Republic managed to reform the TKR para-military into a formal armed force: Tentara Republik Indonesia (Army of the Republic of Indonesia) or TRI, organised by Maj.Gen. Urip Sumohardjo, an ex-KNIL major. This new organisation managed to disband most militias. However, many major militia still remained outside the TRI until a major reorganization 1947 made possible by a United Nations sponsored cease-fire before the Renville negotiations. The fourth phase (December 1945 to December 1946) is considered the aftermath of the heaviest Bersiap fighting. In Jakarta, where hundreds of autonomous Pemuda groups existed, the last months of 1945 were, according to Cribb, a \\"terrifying time of regular looting, robbery, kidnapping and random murders were Europeans and Indo-Europeans disappeared even from the heart of the city, to be found floating in the kali (canals) days later\\".Cribb, Robert. Gangsters and revolutionaries, the Jakarta peoples militia and the Indonesian revolution 1945-1949. (Publisher: Equinox , Singapore, 2009) p.64 In Bandung, Republican attacks against alleged pro-Dutch civilians reached a peak in November and December, with 1,200 killed there.Reid (1973), p. 54. The alleged pro-Dutch civilians mostly included native-born Indo-European, Indo-Chinese, Christian indigenous people (e.g. Menadonese and Ambonese) and indigenous aristocracy, which made the Bersiap period a chaotic mix of civil war, religious conflict and social revolution. Throughout Java regular violence continued through to March 1946. In March 1946, departing Republican forces responded to a British ultimatum for them to leave Bandung by deliberately burning down much of the southern half of the city, in what is known as the \\"Bandung Sea of Fire. Indonesian commanders put much effort into organising irregular fighting units and consolidating their forces on Java. Nasution in West-Java, and Sudirman in Central Java had a hard time controlling the many different armed forces and excluding criminal forces from their ranks, but in the end they succeed. Pressure from the British compelled Dutch politicians to commence negotiations with the Republican leadership, leading to the Linggadjati Agreement, which eventually failed. Indonesian forces began evacuating Japanese military forces and European and Eurasian civilian prisoners. In March 1946, the Royal Netherlands Army started to enter the country to restore order and peace. In July 1946, the last of the Japanese army was evacuated and all British troops were withdrawn by the end of the year, leaving the Dutch military in charge and de facto ending the Bersiap period. Java and Sumatra was now divided into Republican and Dutch controlled areas. The violence and warfare continued. Post Bersiap period Because the Indonesian military leadership was able to control and organise the militant revolutionary forces, the Indonesian political leadership retained overall authority and political leverage in the international arena. The civilian evacuation of Europeans and Indo-Europeans continued until the middle of the next year (May 1947.) Renewed hostility and warfare continued during the struggle for Indonesian independence and lasted until, under heavy political pressure from the United States and the United Nations, the Dutch formally transferred complete sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies to the United States of Indonesia in December 1949. The TNI was established in June 1947 by merging all existing militia with the TRI, forming a united Republican army command in the areas on Java and Sumtra that formed the de facto Republic Indonesia. The establishment of the TNI, and the disbanding of the militias, increased security in Republican-controlled areas, allowing for law and order. Most civilian (allied internees) and Japanese prisoner evacuations from inland Java and Sumatra were done by the TRI (later the TNI after June 1947),as a result of the Linggarjati and Renville Agreements, allowing the British to return home in November 1946. Propaganda Sutomo during one of his speeches. One of the catalysts driving the atrocities committed by Indonesian Pemuda against the native Eurasian civilian population and Ambonese was the inciteful Republican propaganda. Republican propaganda during the revolution was used as a form of political warfare, by communicating loaded messages to produce emotional responses and influence the attitude of the masses, with the objective to further its political and military agenda. Effective means of mass communication were the broadcasts on republican radio stations such as 'Radio Pemberontak' and speeches during mass demonstrations. The supreme republican leader Sukarno had mastered these forms of communication. However, during the Bersiap period, the republican strategic agenda had not yet fully found a common ground and a unitary message on how to achieve its single mission of independence. Due to this paradox, republican communication often fluctuated between moderate (political) and radical (military) messages. The Republican military declaration of total war (14 October 1945) states: \\"When the sun sets, we the Indonesian people are in war with the Dutch.\\" The declaration then continues clearly targeting civilian groups: \\"With this declaration we order all Indonesians to find their own enemy ‚Äì Dutch, Indo or Ambonese.\\" Meijer, Hans. 'In Indie geworteld, de Geschiedenis van Indische Nederlanders, de twintigste eeuw.' (Publisher Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) p. 247 In his speeches, the revolutionary leader, Sutomo, specifically aimed his words at the Eurasian population, verbally reducing them to bloodhounds. In Surabaya, Sutomo had a radio studio and transmitting equipment at his disposal. The first transmission was on 13 October 1945, but could only be received in Surabaya and parts of East-Java. From 16 October 1945, the radio broadcasts could be heard all over Indonesia. The next Sutomo speech was broadcast on 14 October and another on the evening of 15 October. This was the evening of 'black Monday', the day Dutch and Eurasian citizens were rounded up and killed at the Kalisosok and Bubutan prisons in Surabaya.Bussemaker, H.Th. Bersiap! - Opstand in het paradijs. (Walburg Pers, Zutphen, 2005) P.214-218 for the quote above. Soon in the streets of the capital, Batavia, explicit slogans appeared in graffiti on the walls: \\"Death to the Ambonese and Indos!\\" The only pro-Dutch armed forces that existed on Java were small re-grouped South Maluku KNIL units. These so-called 'Ambonese' or 'Belanda Hitam' (English: Black Dutch) as they were called by other Indonesians consequently retaliated against any provocation or attack by Pemuda. Of the millions of people in Java the Pemudas numbers, of approximately a few thousand, were small, but in Jakarta their autonomous contra-terror operations escalated to the point where the British military leadership wanted to de-mobilise them from the city. Indonesian leaders such as Sukarno and Sjahrir attempted to call for calm, but were unable to prevent the atrocities. The small town of Depok, predominantly occupied by native Christians, was one of the first places to be destroyed. Many of its inhabitants were tortured and killed by the Pemuda. The ferocious mix of social revolution, xenophobia, opportunistic crime and feral populism that resulted in the Bersiap atrocities surprised and horrified not only the British commanders, but also moderate Indonesian leaders. On reflection, the Islamicist leader Abu Hanifah who later became minister of education and ambassador admitted: \\"The Indonesian revolution was not totally pure.\\" But while western-educated Indonesian leaders were deeply shaken by what they witnessed, many Indonesian accounts of the time considered the violence inevitable, and even morally neutral.Bayly, Christopher Harper, Tim Forgotten Wars, Freedom and revolution in Southeast Asia (Publisher: Harvard University Press, 2006) P.181-182 Googlebooks Our Struggle October 1945 in an early reaction to the Bersiap atrocities Indonesian independence leader Soetan Sjahrir issued his famous revolutionary pamphlet Our Struggle. In it, Sjahrir strongly opposed and condemned the violence committed against fellow citizens. Guerrilla warfare At first, republican propaganda such as radio speeches and mass rallies were the main tools to influence and mobilise the revolutionary masses. Indonesian military leadership was yet to establish a military agenda and had little control over the many autonomous revolutionary forces. During the Bersiap, Indonesian leaders such as generals Sudirman and Nasution began to hastily build a formal military structure and develop an Indonesian military strategy. In his book about the founding doctrines of Indonesia's Army General Nasution, who became Indonesia's foremost military intellectual, reflects on this strategy and highlights the long term negative psychological and social impact on Indonesian fighters involved in the Bersiap.Nasution, Abdul Haris, Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare and The Indonesian Defence System Past and Future, (Information Service of the Indonesian Armed Forces, Jakarta, 1953) P.50-51 Atrocities Mass grave in Malang, July 1947 After the Bersiap in 1947, Dutch authorities attempted to retrieve the bodies of the victims. Several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the attorney general's office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of Bersiap victims can be found in the Kembang Kuning war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere. The Simpang Society Club Surabaya was appropriated by the Partai Rakyat Indonesia (P.R.I.) Permudas and made into the headquarters of P.R.I. Commander Sutomo, who personally supervised the summary executions of hundreds of civilians. An archived eyewitness statement of the events of 22 October 1945 states: > Before each execution Sutomo mockingly asked the crowd what should be done > with this \\"Musuh (enemy) of the people\\". The crowd yelled \\"Bunuh!\\" (kill!) > after which the executioner named Rustam decapitated the victim with one > stroke of his sword. The victim was then left to the bloodthirst of boys 10, > 11 and 12 years old. ...[who] further mutilated the body.\\" \\"Women were tied > to the tree in the back yard and pierced through the genitals with \\"bambu > runcing\\" (bamboo spears) until they died. On Sutomo's orders the decapitated bodies were disposed of in the sea; the women were thrown in the river.Note: These legal testimonies formerly designated \\"top secret\\" have been made public and are available online. See: Van der Molen, Pia Bussemaker, Herman Archief van Tranen website (2012). Document: 125_A_B_C_D_E_F Online archive Casualties The death toll of the Bersiap period runs into the tens of thousands. The bodies of 3,600 Indo- Europeans have been identified as killed. However, more than 20,000 registered Indo-European civilians were abducted and never returned. After the Bersiap in 1947, Dutch authorities attempted to retrieve the bodies of the victims. Several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the attorney general's office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of Bersiap victims can be found in the Kembang Kuning war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere. The Indonesian revolutionaries lost at least 20,000 fighting men. Estimates of the number of Indonesians killed in the lead-up and during the Battle of Surabaya range from 6,300 to 15,000. The latter number is likely to include civilians including Chineses, Dutch and Eurasians killed by Indonesians. Japanese forces lost around 1,000 soldiers and the British forces registered 660 soldiers, mostly British Indians, as killed (with a similar number missing in action).Bussemaker, H.Th. 'Bersiap! - Opstand in het paradijs.' (Walburg Pers, Zutphen, 2005) The actual Dutch military were hardly involved,Former KNIL POWs were still recuperating in Allied military bases outside of Indonesia (e.g. Japan and the Philippines). The British in fact prohibited Dutch troops to enter the country during most of the Bersiap period. as they only began to return to Indonesia in March and April 1946. Research Few Dutch or Indonesian historians have undertaken holistic studies about this period of the Indonesian revolution. Dutch historians have only focused on particular locations and incidents, while the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (NIOD) has remained idle regarding this important episode of the final phase of Dutch colonial rule. Indonesian historians mostly focus on the heroic aspects of the revolution. Witness reports from Eurasians focus on the atrocities experienced. Japanese historians show very little interest in this part of the aftermath of World War II. The most holistic studies encompassing all these elements have in fact been performed by American and English historians. Commemoration In 1988, a national 'Indies Monument' () was erected in The Hague, Netherlands, to commemorate the victims of both the Japanese occupation and Indonesian National Revolution. Originally there were 22 dedicated cemeteries in Indonesia, laid out between 1946 and 1952. Earth from these 22 war cemeteries was collected in an urn and was integrated into the Dutch National Monument (Amsterdam) on the Dam Square. At the request of the Indonesian government, the number of war cemeteries was reduced to seven. These cemeteries, Menteng Pulo and Ancol (Jakarta), Pandu (Bandung), Leuwigajah (Cimahi), Candi and Kalibanteng (Semarang), Kembang Kuning (Surabaya), are all located on Java and managed and maintained by ' or the Dutch War Graves Foundation. The bodies of European and Indo-European victims of the Bersiap atrocities that were retrieved from individual and mass graves elsewhere on Java are mostly buried in these war cemeteries.The Indisch Monument, official publication (15 August 1945 Commemoration Foundation, The Hague, 2008) Archived online: See also * Indonesian National Revolution References=Notes and citationsBibliography * Anderson, B.R.O.G.

Early life Basil Ede was born 12 February 1931 in Surrey. Ede's interest in drawing began early in life.Introduction Basil Ede's Birds. Hamlyn Paperbacks 1982 As a schoolboy growing up during the Second World War, he filled his exercise books with sketches of military aircraft and caricatures of his school teachers. He was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead. He later attended Kingston School of Art.Field Notes and Recollections, Wild Birds of America, The Art of Basil Ede. Abrams 1991 However, in 1949, he was called up for military service in the British Army. Initially he trained as a Gunner with The Royal Artillery but after being selected to attend Mons Officer Cadet School, he was awarded a commission in the RASC, serving as Second Lieutenant and then Lieutenant . On leaving the army at the end of 1951, Ede joined the Merchant Navy, and he set sail on his maiden voyage as a purser on board Orient Line's Empire Orwell in early 1952. The ship's established route was between Southampton and Japan, via Suez, Aden, Columbo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Pusan.Field Notes and Recollections, Wild Birds of America, The Art of Basil Ede. Abrams 1991. In addition to these duties, the ship was at this time deployed to help transport British troops and equipment to and from the Korean War. Ede was to become fascinated by the Far East and in particular by its art. This was undoubtedly to have an influence on his later work.Field Notes and Recollections, Wild Birds of America, The Art of Basil Ede. Abrams 1991 Coming ashore for good, Ede joined Cunard Line as a young executive in 1956. By now he spent most of his spare time painting and negotiating with galleries and publishers. His employers, far from being annoyed, actually commissioned him to design a series of covers for their first class menu cards on the RMS Queen Elizabeth and RMS Queen Mary. In 1964 Ede left Cunard and became a full time artist.Interview with Judith A. Troops, Birders World, August 1989.

The case dealt with limits of the powers of the Australian Federal Government under section 81 of the Constitution of Australia, Consolidated Revenue Fund. to take and spend money by legislation, in this case to fund reduced prices for prescription medicines. Background In 1944, the Labor Federal Government of Prime Minister Ben Chifley bill for the \\"Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944\\" received Royal Assent. The law was immediately challenged by the Attorney-General for Victoria on behalf of three Victorian medical doctors, Dale, McCallum and Watson, who were the president, vice-president and secretary of the Victorian Medical Association.The latin abbreviation \\"ex rel\\" in the title means \\"at the relation of\\" and indicates the Attorney General was bringing the proceedings on behalf of the doctors. Doctors opposed the scheme because they saw it as the start of a plan to nationalise healthcare. Decision=Standing The first matter to be decided was whether a State Attorney General had \\"standing\\" to intercede in a Commonwealth matter. All of the judges held that the Attorney-General has standing to argue that an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament was invalid under the constitution, following a line of authority commencing with the Union Label case.. Justice Dixon reformulated the test, holding that: > It is the traditional duty of the Attorney-General to protect public rights > and to complain of excesses of a power bestowed by law and in our Federal > system the result has been to give the Attorney-General of a State a locus > standi to sue for a declaration wherever his public is or may be affected by > what he says is an ultra vires act on the part of the Commonwealth or of > another State. at p. 272 per Dixon J. Appropriations power On the substantial matter of the constitutionality of \\"Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944\\",Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944 (Cth). the issue was whether the appropriations power, was a free standing power to spend any money raised by the Australian government, or whether the power was limited to matters on which the Australian parliament could pass legislation, particularly section 51 of the constitution. Legislative powers of the Parliament. The majority of the court took a restrictive view of the appropriations power, holding that the Act was beyond the scope of the powers granted to the Federal Government in section 81 of the Constitution. The court was however divided as to the nature of that restriction, with each judge giving the own judgment and there was no clear reason for the decision. Latham CJ took a broad view of the appropriations power, however he characterised the law as one controlling doctors, chemists and the sale of drugs and only incidentally for the appropriation of money. Justices Starke and Williams held that expenditure had to be supported by another head of legislative power. Justice Dixon rejected both the narrow and wide view of the appropriations power, holding that each question had to be determined according to \\"the distribution of powers and functions between the Commonwealth and the States\\", but deciding, similarly to Latham CJ, that the \\"Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944\\" was primarily for dispensing free medicine and appropriation of money was only incidental. Rich J agreed with Dixon J. Justice McTiernan dissented, taking a wide view of the appropriations power, holding that \\"The Constitution puts the power of the purse in the hands of Parliament, not in the hands of the Courts.\\" Aftermath=1946 Referendum The decision prompted the 1946 referendum to amend the Constitution to give the Australian Parliament the power to make laws with respect to: > s51(xxiiiA.) The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child > endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, > medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil > conscription), benefits to students and family allowances: The referendum was passed, being approved by 54.39% of voters and obtained a majority in all six States.Handbook of the 44th Parliament (2014) . Second Pharmaceutical Benefits case After the success of the referendum, the Australian Parliament passed the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947,Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947 (Cth). relying on the new head of power. The majority of the high Court held that the Act was invalid as authorising a form of civil conscription.. The construction of section 81 of the constitution was settled on the narrow view, that expenditure had to be supported by another head of legislative power.

Later it has been recorded as a nursery rhyme and a proverb. Origin The anecdote associated with the origin of the rhyme is that when Brown was a student at Christ Church, Oxford, he was caught doing mischief. The college dean, John Fell (1625‚Äì1686) had expelled Brown but offered to take him back if he passed a test. If Brown could make an extempore translation of the thirty-second epigram of Martial, his expulsion would be cancelled. The epigram in Latin is as follows: a literal translation of which is \\"I do not like you, Sabidius, nor can I say why. This much I can say: I do not like you.\\" Brown successfully met the challenge with his impromptu version, which soon became well known: Later use The verse was not mentioned as a nursery rhyme until late in the 19th century and did not appear in collections of such material.

The Feria festival is held alongside the carnival feast. The festival includes bull competitions, cultural expositions, commercial and zootechnic expositions, concerts, parades, sports, and a voting competition for La Reina Del Sol ().Krzysztof Dydy≈Ñski, Charlotte Beech, Venezuela, Lonely Planet, 2004, History The city of M√©rida or City of the Knights had celebrated its historic past in Venezuela, but it did not have fairs similar to the cities of San Crist√≥bal, Barquisimeto, Maracaibo, or T√°riba. Therefore, a group of amateurs got the idea to build a Plaza de Toros (Plaza of Bulls), so that M√©rida had a taurine calendar and a fair counted among the most important of the country. The fair was set for 9 and 10 December, as the feast of Immaculate Conception coincided with the beginning of the month. For the bullfighting, C√©sar Faraco, Manuel Ben√≠tez \\"El Cordob√©s\\", Francisco Rivera \\"Paquirri\\", Julio Aparicio, Curro Gir√≥n, Paco Camino and the mounted bullfighter, Juan Ca√±edo, who is of Mexican origin, fought the bulls of F√©lix Rodr√≠guez, \\"Achury Vejo\\" and \\"Ambal√≥\\", who all originated in the country of Colombia. Plaza de Toros Rom√°n Eduardo Sandia, M√©rida Heavy rainfall impeded the first run, resulting in two runs being held on the second day: one in the morning hours and the other during the afternoon; it was the first time this had happened in the same arena in Venezuela. Previously in Caracas there had been two runs on the same day, but in two different arenas, the \\"Circo Metropolitano\\" and the \\"Nuevo Circo\\". In December 1968, the fair wasn't celebrated, though bullfighting did occur on 13 April 1968 on the occasion of Holy Saturday. A stupendous closing was fought by \\"Dosguti√©rrez\\", Alfredo Leal, Curro Gir√≥n and Pepe C√°ceres. Then it was decided to celebrate these fairs so that they coincided with the carnivals already known as Feria del Sol; thus in 1969 the first bullfighting carnival took place with three run of bulls, on 15‚Äì17 February. The first poster consisted of bulls of \\"Valpara√≠so\\" for Alfredo Leal, Daniel \\"Matatoba\\" Santiago, Manuel Ben√≠tez \\"El Cordob√©s\\" and the Venezuelan Lucio Requena. The first ear of the fair was for Alfredo Leal. The Reina or Novia del Sol (Queen of the Sun) 2009 Since then, the fair has developed into one of the most important fairs of Venezuela, as well as the taurine world.

Carlton Hill station was the second station along the Erie's main line and the first station after Rutherford Junction, where the Erie's main line forked from the Bergen County Railroad. The station provided service for passengers in Rutherford and Wallington\\"s Carlton Hill district and freight billing for the Royce Chemical Company, producer of Royox household cleaner, epoxies and dyes. After Carlton Hill, the main line continued westward to Passaic Park and eastward to Rutherford-East Rutherford and Pavonia Terminal. Carlton Hill Station opened in 1888 on Jackson Avenue and namesake Erie Avenue in Rutherford. The station was served by the main line until 1963, when the Passaic Plan was undertaken, removing tracks at Passaic Park, Passaic, Clifton, and Lake View stations. At that point, the nearby drawbridge was permanently swung open and later removed, leaving a branch to Carlton Hill. For the next few years, Carlton Hill received deadhead trains and a rare Carlton Hill - Rutherford - Hoboken Terminal train schedule. In 1966, when several underused branches, including the Carlton Hill, lost service, the old main line alignment to Carlton Hill was abandoned. The tracks remain, though the building is gone, having been demolished in October 1967\\\\.  Station layout and services  Carlton Hill station was situated at the intersection with Jackson Avenue in Rutherford, where the Erie Railroad's main line crossed, away from New York City's Chambers Street Ferry Terminal. The main line crossed through Carlton Hill on two tracks, separated by inter-track fencing. There was one main line platform, next to the station depot, which was located on the eastbound side of the tracks. During the morning commuter rush, Carlton Hill was full of commuters heading for New York City. After the commuter rush, a station agent's work was to inspect the yard and complete freight billing for the Royce Chemical Company. The yard commonly had boxcars, empty and loaded waiting for pick-up.Yanosey, pg 32 Although the station no longer gets use, the former site is accessible via New Jersey Transit's buses #160 and #190 along with a walk down to Jackson Avenue. The former station site and trackage are owned by Norfolk Southern Railway.http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2013/09/rail_company_wants_residents_to_stay_off_community- created_nature_trail.html  History = Opening to 1963  Carlton Hill station was first constructed in 1888 as a wooden structure at Jackson Avenue in Rutherford. The wooden station was the common design for station depots used by the Erie Railroad, designated Type IV. In 1889, upon opening of the station, formerly called West Rutherford, the station received eighteen trains from New York City and Jersey City daily, seventeen to New York City daily, and ten fewer trips on weekend each. The fare to get to Carlton Hill from Jersey City was $0.35 for one-way tickets, and $0.50 for round trips. The Erie's \\"Family Commutation Service\\", which was 50 trips, cost the rider $8.75. On September 6, 1911, a woman named Elizabeth King was struck and killed by an Erie Railroad passenger train at Carlton Hill. The woman, heading to Passaic to visit her daughter in the local hospital for an operation, was of poor eyesight and was unable to see the train. At the time, the Erie had not implemented intertrack fencing, but the intersection with Jackson Avenue had been given flashing lights and bells to signify the oncoming train. After the incident, the New Jersey State Legislature got involved with the case and gave the Erie suggestions to add intertrack fencing at Carlton Hill to prevent another such incident.  Passaic Plan and closing  Carlton Hill station in March 2011, 45 years after the station closed. The partially overgrown tracks of the old Erie Railroad main line are visible along the deteriorating platform During the 1950s and 1960s, several different priorities from different agencies around the cities of Paterson and Passaic were beginning to form. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, a competing railroad with the Erie, wanted to condense (along with the Erie) services and share trackage because of financial troubles. Secondly, the city officials in Passaic had first brought a proposal to the Erie asking about the removal of the main line through the city, which was tying up traffic in the city during station stops. This, however, was not implemented during the 1950s, as proposed. Instead, the Erie reconstructed the stations at Passaic and Clifton. Third, the New Jersey State Highway Department needed rights-of-way for Interstate 80 through Paterson and State Route 21 through Passaic (right where Passaic Park station and BE Drawbridge were located). After the merge on October 17, 1960, between the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Erie, the city officials in Passaic once again brought back the possibility of removing the tracks through Main Street, Passaic. This time, the newly formed Erie‚ÄìLackawanna went forward with it, beginning the process to move its main line onto the former Boonton Branch through Lyndhurst, Passaic and Clifton. The main line was abandoned past Carlton Hill, and BE Drawbridge was swung in the open position. The bridge was soon put up for sale price of $0.00 in 1964 by the mayor of Passaic. Carlton Hill station site in January 2015, mostly cleared After the abandonment of the Erie Railroad's main line through the city of Passaic, the two-tracked stub from Rutherford and Bergen Junction westward through Carlton Hill remained in service as the Carlton Hill Branch. This alignment received most of the deadhead trains, but there was a limited set of Carlton Hill - Rutherford - Hoboken trains, making only those two stops.Yanosey, pg 33 In October 1966, along with the Newark Branch and the spur of the New York & Greenwood Lake to Wanaque, the Carlton Hill Branch service were discontinued and the station no longer received passenger trains. The station building was later demolished, and only the tracks and asphalt platform remain to this date at Jackson Avenue.Yanosey, pg. 60 The station depot was razed in October 1967, a year after service ended after falling into a state of disrepair and complaints from local residents.

This is a method for detecting and characterizing large protein polymers which are stable in 2% SDS at room temperature, unlike most large protein complexes. This method is very useful for studying prions and amyloids, which are characterized by the formation of proteinaceous polymers. Agarose is used for the gel since the SDS-resistant polymers are large (in the 200-4000+ kDa range) and cannot enter a conventional polyacrylamide gel, which has small pores. Agarose on the other hand has large pores, which allows for the separation of polymers. Use of this method allowed researchers to understand that at least some types of prion aggregates existed in a two-level structure - protein molecules grouped into polymers, which are very stable and withstand treatment with 2% SDS at room temperature, and aggregates, which are bundles of polymers, that dissociate under these conditions. Differences in the size of polymers can indicate the efficiency of polymer fragmentation in vivo. History The method was created in the Molecular Genetics laboratory of the Russian Cardiology Research Institute and was published in 2003 by Kryndushkin et al. The original method used a TAE buffering system and incorporated a modified vacuum blotting system for the transfer of proteins onto a membrane (originally PVDF). The modified vacuum blotting system is actually a vacuum-assisted capillary transfer, since the vacuum only helps fluid that has already gone through the gel and membrane to leave the system. Variations Other modifications have also been used, such as the one described in Bagriantsev et al., using traditional wet transfer and a TGB buffering system, and others using semi-dry transfer or capillary transfer. DD-AGE, a further variation of the method that uses fully denaturing conditions - including reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and heat denaturation at 95¬∞C - is suitable for the analysis of heat-stable inclusion bodies of polyglutamine proteins.

Smart Way Reading and Spelling Over two years in development, Smart Way Reading and Spelling is designed to be simple to use yet it is extremely efficient in teaching students. The reading methodology ranges from teaching introductory sounds and how to learn American English through advanced reading strategies. The program has been used effectively in remedial reading programs Overview of the Results of the Bright Sky Learning, Lancaster-Lebanon Intermediate Unit 13, School District of Lancaster Tutoring Research Project, by Lana Edwards Santoro, Ph.D., Education Associates; Angela Kirby-Wehr, M.Ed., Pennsylvania Training and Technical Assistance Network (PaTTAN); and, Edward S. Shapiro, Ph.D., Lehigh University, 2006. in states across the country with positive and consistent results and is based on the most complete scientific research on teaching reading which stresses systematic and explicit phonics coupled with reading comprehension and fluency.National Reading Panel report The Smart Way Reading and Spelling program is presented in a series of twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text on one side of the flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.  Additional Research Base of the Program  The delivery of the Smart Way Reading and Spelling program is based on the concept of self- efficacy and its application in instructional practices.Bandura, A.

He was a member of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) and the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (RE). He painted rural landscape scenes in watercolour. Samuel Henry Baker was born in Birmingham, the son of Thomas Baker who was a manager at Matthew Boulton‚Äôs Soho Works. He was apprenticed to James Chaplin, a magic-lantern slide painter and trained at Birmingham School of Design. He also took lessons from the landscape painter, Joseph Paul Pettitt who had been a pupil of Joseph Vincent Barber. It was possibly through Pettit that Baker inherited the distinctive drawing style of the Birmingham School with its clear outlines and bold cross hatching. He exhibited over five hundred paintings at the RBSA from 1848‚Äì1909 and was elected a member in 1868. His older son Oliver (1856‚Äì1939) was also an artist and a designer of note,Oliver Baker (Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery) while his younger son Harold (1860-1942) was a noted photographer.Harold Baker Collection - Library of Birmingham NotesExternal links *S H Baker (charterprints.co.uk) *List of works by S H Baker Category:19th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:20th-century English painters Category:English watercolourists Category:Landscape artists Category:1824 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Members and Associates of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists ","title":"Samuel Henry Baker"},{"id":"26964696","text":"The Wych Brook or Red Brook, formerly known as the River Elfe, is a small river in the north-west midlands of the United Kingdom. It forms both the historic and present-day border between England (Cheshire) and Wales (Maelor Saesneg, a detached portion of Flintshire, now within Wrexham County Borough). It is a tributary of the River Dee. Course and landscape The Wych Brook rises (as the \\"Red Brook\\") at Fenn's Moss on the Wrexham / Shropshire border, and flows northward and westward through a steep-sided, wooded valley to Threapwood, being joined by several smaller streams such as the Grindley Brook, which rises near the village of the same name, and the Iscoyd Brook. Near the community of Willington Worthenbury it is joined by the Emral Brook, and runs northward to the Dee near Shocklach.Maelor Saesneg, Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust The Emral Brook itself rises near Penley and is joined by a number of tributary streams which drain the central part of Maelor Saesneg. The middle section of the river valley, which has eroded deeply into an underlying glacial drift of boulder clay, sands and gravels, is the narrowest and deepest, particularly between Dymock's Mill and Lower Wych.The Wych Valley, Wrexham Borough Council The river landscape is characterised by ancient mixed ash woodland, unintensively-farmed lowland pasture and rush pasture. The English side of the valley is designated as an Area of Special County Value.The Wych Valley, WCBC Typical landscape of the Wych Brook valley: the foreground is in England and the rising ground in the distance in Wales. The Wych Brook was formerly known as the River Elfe or Elf. The origin of the name \\"Elfe\\" is in this case unknown, though the name \\"Wych\\" is thought to derive from saline springs in the area. There were formerly a number of natural salt springs or 'brine pits' near the river bank at Higher Wych and Lower Wych, which from medieval times were used as a water source for commercial salt production.Lee, \\"Iscoyd in Maelor Saesneg], Archaeologia Cambrensis, XXVI, April 1876, p.92 It has been speculated that the river name Elfe is based on the Welsh language root hal-, halen, \\"salt\\". Ecology The river is a habitat for a variety of fish including brown trout, common dace, the gudgeon Gobio gobio, stone loach and common minnow. There is an unusual isolated population of dormice in the Wych Valley, as a result of an introduction of animals in 1996/7.Dormouse, Cheshire Region Biodiversity Partnership References Category:Rivers of Cheshire Category:Rivers of Shropshire Category:Rivers of Wrexham County Borough 2Wych ","title":"Wych Brook"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},L={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",L,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,p)=>(t(),b(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",R]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/2.md","filePath":"people/2.md"}'),D={name:"people/2.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{E as __pageData,F as default};
